   The Chicago City Council on Friday unanimously
approved a zoning request to allow construction of a 125-story
building, which would be 15 stories higher than the world's tallest.
   The building, proposed by the Chicago real estate development
firm Miglin-Beitler Inc., would rise 1,950 feet, 496 feet taller
than the Sears Tower, currently the world's tallest building.
   The proposed Miglin-Beitler Tower would be in the city's west
Loop area downtown, near the 110-story Sears Tower.
   The council approved the zoning request 44-0, said Alderman
William Banks, chairman of the Committee on Zoning.
   Developer Paul Beitler said the tower's skinny design will cater
to the ``new market of the 1990s'' _ consulting firms, small
corporations and other small tenants who can't afford entire floors
in fatter office buildings.

   Authorities arrested a woman wanted on a drug
charge who eluded police for 18 months, taunting them with
telephone calls and a note reading ``Nya, Nya, Nya.''
   ``She created her own notoriety on this thing,'' said Lt. Gary
Rogness, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's narcotics
unit in the San Fernando Valley.
   Deborah Ulrich, 42, of Encino was arrested Thursday as she was
leaving her son's Hollywood apartment, police said Friday.
   Police learned of her whereabouts from a news story last month
saying she was president of her son's rock group fan club, Rogness
said.
   Ulrich's case started June 19, 1987, when officers searched an
apartment and found cocaine valued at $85,000. Police issued a
cocaine possession warrant for Ulrich, who was in Mexico at the
time.
   She repeatedly taunted officers with letters and telephone calls
in which she said she was innocent, Rogness said.
   One handwritten letter, posted from Colorado, said: ``Nya, Nya,
Nya.''
   She addressed the police as ``dingbats'' and said: ``I want to
continue to make a fool of you. I'll be a folk hero and you'll look
like the moron you are.''
   The letter continued: ``Even if you should be lucky enough to
get me, which is pretty unlikely, considering how stupid you are,
you'd then have to face a jury of my peers who are likely to laugh
you out of court,'' he said.
   After her arrest, Ulrich said she would make bail and flee to
Mexico or Canada, said Detective Paul True. Police convinced a
judge that Ulrich was a ``flight risk'' and had her held on $1
million bail.

   The calls poured into newspapers, radio and
television stations: Young men suddenly were being summoned for
active service and their wives and mothers demanded to know why.
   Then they gathered on town squares and demanded that the call-up
stop.
   ``I won't give up my son!'' a woman shouted furiously at a
public protest in the southern Russian city of Stavropol, where
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was Communist Party chief for many
years.
   ``We put up with everything, we put up with it, we put up with
it, how long are we going to put up with everything?'' she asked in
a report that was shown on the nationwide television news program,
``Vremya.''
   At a Stavropol assembly hall, another woman shown on ``Vremya''
proclaimed that her factory objected to the call-up. ``We don't
want the peoples of these republics to call us occupants. We don't
want another Afghanistan,'' she said.
   Such powerful reaction to Thursday's call-up of reservists in
southern Russia to help impose order in ethnic strife in the
Caucasus showed just how public sentiment toward military service
had changed in the post-Afghanistan era.
   The protests appeared to get results. Gorbachev acknowledged the
population in the southern Russia areas where the call-up went out
were unhappy, and state-run media reported Friday that all the
reservists would be home by Wednesday, replaced by career soldiers.
   In an almost apologetic tone, the Soviet forces' chief political
officer, A.D. Lizichev, told Tass that the reserve call-up ``was a
forced, but unavoidable measure.''
   ``After all, we're talking about the fate of peoples. About
bringing order in our Soviet home,'' he said.
   Such arguments seemed to have little effect, however, on the
residents of Stavropol.
   One speaker at the Stavropol protest urged the several hundred
people to come back Saturday to approve an official document
calling for the call-up to end and all the reservists to be sent
home.
   A woman in a shiny fur hat complained to the cameras: ``The
situation is getting worse, and today when my son is called up, I
categorically object to my son's blood being spilled. What for?
Because the government isn't taking radical measures.''
   During the nine years of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan,
there were virtually no antiwar protests except a few small pickets
by brave mothers.
   But since the last Soviet soldiers pulled out in February, the
government has said the intervention was a mistake and it has
become acceptable to condemn the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan
as an ill-conceived foreign adventure.
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Friday it had
been swamped with calls from the families of reservists.
   ```They've taken my husband to war!' groaned a young woman from
Kislovodsk into the phone,'' the newspaper said. ``And then
followed calls from Pyatigorsk, Yessentukov, Proletarsk in the
Rostov region,'' all cities in the Russian area near the Caucasus.

<HEAD>Rice Bran Study Casts Doubt On Cholesterol-Reducing Effects</HEAD>
<HEAD>Ed: RETRANSMITTING to correct category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First, the good stuff about oat bran was debunked
in a prestigious medical journal.
   Now rice is taking its lumps.
   And the rice industry footed the bill.
   A University of Texas Health Science Center researcher has just
finished a $162,000 study paid for by rice industry backers, and
the researcher says if rice bran has any cholesterol-lowering
benefits, he hasn't found them.
   Instead, he advised people trying to lower cholesterol levels to
reduce fat intake, get to a normal weight and exercise.
   The rice industry, which has disassociated itself from the
study, says the report by nutritionist Jim Hickson and partner Mark
Clasen is inconclusive.
   Rice Council of America spokesman Kris O'Brien said three other
studies have shown rice bran ``does have a positive effect on
cholesterol.''
   Referring to Hickson's study, O'Brien said, ``We don't think
it's proper to say that since his test didn't show anything, the
other three studies are wiped out.''
   Hickson said, ``The companies were not happy _ they were very
unhappy. When you come up empty, it's like you failed.''
   In the study, about 64 volunteers spent 15 weeks eating foods
prepared by the university health center.
   In the first 10 weeks, the diet included 50 grams of rice bran
daily, most of it concealed in bread. Researchers monitored
cholesterol levels.
   ``We knew by week 6 or 7 nothing was happening,'' Hickson said.
   At week 10, the rice bran intake was increased to 100 grams a
day.
   Hickson said he questioned whether 100 grams of rice bran a day
_ about two cups _ was a realistic amount to consume.

   ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met Sally'' were favored in tonight's
47th Annual Golden Globes competition.
   Hosts Cybill Shepherd and Sam Elliott will preside over the
ceremonies, carried by Turner Broadcasting Service starting at 7
p.m. PST.
   A total of 24 awards _ 13 for motion pictures and 11 for
television programs _ were selected by 83 voting members of the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
   The globes often serve as indicators of the Academy Awards,
whose nominations are to be announced Feb. 14.
   Last year, for example, ``Rain Man'' took two top Golden Globes
and went on to dominate the Academy Awards.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's gripping
account of how a patriotic soldier's attitudes about war are
exploded in Vietnam, had five nominations. Tom Cruise, who stars in
the film as paraplegic Ron Kovic, was nominated as best actor in a
dramatic motion picture.
   Stone was nominated for best director and the film was named in
the race for best dramatic motion picture.
   Unlike the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes divide films into
the categories of dramas and musicals or comedies.
   Also nominated for best dramatic picture were ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and
``Glory.''
   The selections for best musical or comic movie were ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Shirley Valentine,'' ``The
War of the Roses'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...''
   ``Glory,'' the account of a black Union regiment fighting in the
Civil War, earned a total of five nominations, as did ``When Harry
Met Sally ...''
   ``L.A. Law,'' with eight nominations, was the favored television
show.

   A Delta Airlines MD-80 jet with 89 people on
board blew a tire during takeoff Friday from O'Hare International
Airport, but was able to return to the airport safely after dumping
its fuel over Lake Michigan, officials said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Flight 575, bound for Atlanta, took off from O'Hare at 1:37 p.m.
and returned to the airport at 2:34 p.m. after the pilot radioed
that a tire in the main landing gear had blown during takeoff, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   Before returning to O'Hare, the pilot followed standard
procedure by dumping fuel over Lake Michigan because the aircraft
was too heavy to land with a full fuel load, said Lisa Howard, a
spokeswoman for the city's Department of Aviation.
   Ms. Howard said the plane landed without incident and taxied to
the terminal, where passengers left the plane and were placed on
other flights.

   The length of military service
will be shortened from 24 to 18 months and the number of
Czechoslovak troops slashed by 3O,000 by August, a daily said.
   The troop cut will begin April 1 and be completed by August, the

Fiala. The new army conscription terms, proposed by the government,
will be submitted to Parliament for approval this spring, and
officials say they are assured of approval.
   The length of army service for university graduates will be
reduced from 12 to 9 months, Fiala was quoted as saying.
   Those soldiers who have families with children as well as
servicemen with impaired health will be eligible for the new
shortened terms retroactively, state TV said.
   In January 1989, Czechoslovakia announced cuts in its military
manpower and hardware amounting to 138 tanks, 51 planes and 18,OOO
soldiers.
   According to officially published figures, there are 197,OOO
regular servicemen in the Czechoslovak army.

<TEXT>
   A member of the imperial family who became Japan's
first prime minister after World War II died today at the age of
102, officials at the Imperial Household Agency said.
   Naruhiko Higashikuni, a great uncle of Emperor Akihito, had been
hospitalized since last May, but his condition worsened in
November, the officials said. He died from heart failure at the
Nisseki Medical Center in Tokyo.
   Higashikuni was the first imperial family member to head a
Cabinet. He formed it two days after Japan surrendered to the
allies on August 15, 1945, at the request of the late Emperor
Hirohito.
   His Cabinet, however, lasted less than two months because of
general confusion in the country during the immediate postwar
period.
   In October 1947, Higashikuni left the imperial family to become
a commoner.
   Born in 1887 as the ninth child of Prince Kuninomiya,
Higashikuni is an uncle of Nagako, the Empress Dowager and widow of
Hirohito.
   He graduated from military school and studied in France from
1920 to 1927. During World War II he fought in the Japanese
imperial army as a general.
   In 1962, Higashikuni filed a suit against the government
claiming his right to a large tract of government-owned land in
southern Tokyo because it was given to him by the emperor. He
withdrew the case abruptly in 1964.

   The Navy flew a Tomahawk cruise missile over
Maine on Friday in the first such flight since the state's voters
rejected missile tests over their soil in a referendum in November.
   The unarmed missile went on a 700-mile roundabout flight from
the destroyer USS Conolly to a recovery site at a Navy survival
school outside Rangeley in western Maine. The test was ``extremely
successful,'' said Bob Holsapple, spokesman for the Navy cruise
missile project.
   In Portland, organizers of the referendum to halt the tests were
outraged and planned demonstrations next week.
   The test flight, which began at noon and lasted approximately 90
minutes, followed a meandering path across the center of the state,
primarily above forest and mountains. The test had been delayed
earlier in the week because of bad weather.
   Temperatures at flight levels were around zero, allowing the
Navy to carry out its mission of testing the Tomahawk's performance
in cold weather, Holsapple said.
   Before parachuting to the ground at the recovery site, the
missile circled the town of Rangeley at an altitude of about 3,500
feet, the Navy spokesman said.
   Eric Johnson, spokesman for the Coalition for the Cruise Missile
Referendum, said he was incensed that the Navy's defied Maine
voters who approved the non-binding referendum against missile
tests by 52 percent to 48 percent.
   The test is particularly inappropriate when the easing of Cold
War tensions has reduced the need expensive weapon systems, he
said, maintaining that cruise missiles pose the greatest single
obstacle to a strategic arms treaty.
   Earlier this month, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III
notified the Maine congressional delegation that three test flights
were planned this year despite the referendum.

<HEAD>Dole Predicts Moynihan Social Security Proposal Will
`Self-Destruct'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole predicts a
Democratic proposal to roll back Social Security payroll tax hikes
will ``self-destruct'' in Congress.
   Dole told reporters Friday the move by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to slash the taxes must be reconciled with
another Democrat's push for enactment of a national sales tax _ and
predicted that couldn't happen.
   The Kansas Republican linked the Social Security proposal to
legislation to be submitted by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
seeking a 5 percent value added tax.
   ``He'll deliver the good news'' of a tax cut, he said of
Moynihan, and Hollings ``will deliver the bad news.'' Because of
this, Dole said, the Social Security initiative will
``self-destruct.''
   Not only that, Dole said, the White House will soon offer a
proposal that would force the government to stop using the Social
Security surpluses to reduce the budget deficit.
   Dole commented as Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced his own
proposal for preventing use of surplus Social Security taxes to
reduce the federal deficit.
   Porter said that unlike Moynihan's proposal, his would protect
retirees without ``playing tax-cut politics with the Social
Security system.''
   Meantime, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
that Moynihan's proposal dramatizes ``the inequity and regressive
nature'' of the tax system, but he wasn't ready to endorse it.
   Mitchell said he's worried about the impact of Moynihan's
proposal on the multibillion-dollar budget deficit and said he
would await two staff studies before making up his mind.
   But he criticized President Bush for immediately resisting
Moynihan's proposal, saying, ``I regret the manner in which the
president and the White House has treated t.''
   Discussing issues facing lawmakers when the second session of
the 101st Congress resumes next week, Mitchell used the Social
Security payroll tax issue to attack Bush's tax policies,
particularly his quest for a cut in capital gains taxes.
   The Maine Democrat said Moynihan stated ``in very stark terms
the administration's tax policy, which is, `Let's cut taxes for the
wealthy, but not the working people. ... Let the little people pay,
cut taxes for the very wealthy.'''
   ``I think that is a tax policy that is unfair and wrong from a
policy standpoint, and Senator Moynihan has expressed it
dramatically,'' he said.
   Moynihan wants to roll back the Social Security payroll tax
increase that began Jan. 1. His proposal would save workers $7
billion in Social Security taxes this year and $55 billion in
fiscal 1991.
   The payroll tax, paid by both employers and employees, rose to
7.65 percent Jan. 1 from 7.51 percent, and it is levied on wages up
to $51,300 instead of $48,000. A wage-earner could pay as much as
$3,924 in Social Security taxes this year, an increase of about
$319 from 1989.
   Porter's plan, which is being promoted by House Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia, would return the surplus proportionately
to workers. The money would not come in tax cuts or refunds, but
into a kind of Individual Retirement Account and each worker's
claim on future Social Security benefits would drop as the
individual account builds.

<TEXT>
   In a show of support for an emerging
democracy, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit
Czechoslovakia next month after he holds talks in Moscow on easing
East-West tensions.
   U.S. officials say Baker may add other Eastern and Central
European stops to his schedule, as the Bush administration steps up
its campaign of trying to encourage Warsaw Pact countries to adopt
Western political and economic systems.
   Czechoslovakia is making that transition with little indication
of tension. It flirted with reform in 1968 and then experienced two
decades of hard-line rule after the ``Prague Spring'' was
extinguished by Soviet troops and tanks.
   Baker, who is going to Moscow on Feb. 4 for talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, also is considering stops
in Romania and Bulgaria, the U.S. officials said Friday.
   The Bush administration is in the midst of working out a program
to lower U.S. tariffs so Czechoslovakia can boost its trade with
the United States. That would involve a waiver from strictures of
the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, which imposed high tariffs on
most communist countries.
   Baker will discuss with Shevardnadze, among other topics, arms
control and the 12-year-old civil war in Afghanistan.
   Baker will try to resolve with Shevardnadze how long-range,
air-launched cruise missiles carried by bombers should be counted
against a treaty limit of 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads.
   The goal is to complete a treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
long-range missiles by 30 to 50 percent in time for it to be signed
by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
their Washington summit meeting in June.
   Robert Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
met with Afghan rebel leaders Thursday in Pakistan to help set the
stage for Baker's meeting with Shevardnadze.
   The Soviets withdrew their troops from Afghanistan last year,
but the pro-Moscow government has managed to hold its own against
U.S.-armed rebels.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
Baker discusses peace prospects for Afghanistan every time he sees
Shevardnadze.
   Baker likely will go to Prague on Feb. 8 or 9, depending on
other undecided travel plans, said the officials, who demanded
anonymity. He will wind up in Ottawa for the Feb. 12-13 conference
with NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers on the U.S. ``open
skies'' proposal.
   That proposal would allow unarmed aircraft to fly over other
countries' territories in search of suspected military activity.
   Czechoslovakia, at one time a hard-line Communist state, is led
by President Vaclav Havel and Speaker of the Parliament Alexander
Dubcek.
   Havel, a writer, was a target of the old regime for advocating
human rights. Dubcek was a leader of the reform movement that took
power in 1968 and then was crushed by Soviet troops and tanks.
   The country is moving toward democratic elections. Havel's
brother, Ivan, a member of Civic Forum, a pro-democracy movement,
and Martin Palous, the group's foreign policy spokesman, are due to
visit Washington next week.

   The town where the hefty half of Laurel and
Hardy was born unveiled a marker to commemorate that event and
hopes to become a mecca for fans of Oliver Hardy and his frail
British pal, Stan Laurel.
   The ceremony Thursday marked what would have been Hardy's 98th
birthday. He was born in 1892 in Harlem, an eastern Georgia village
of about 1,500 people, and died in Hollywood in 1957.
   A proclamation from Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris called Hardy,
who portrayed a blustering, frustrated dunce in the duo's films,
``the most famous of all Georgia entertainers.''
   Guests at the ceremony included Bill Cubin, curator of the Stan
Laurel Museum in Ulverston, England, Laurel's hometown.

   Actor Christian Slater, who
appeared in ``Tucker: A Man and His Dream'' and ``Heathers,''
pleaded innocent to drunken driving charges.
   The 20-year-old heartthrob from suburban Van Nuys is charged
with five misdemeanor counts, including battery on a police officer
and resisting arrest during a late night incident.
   An Aprl 2 preliminary hearing was set for Slater, who is free on
$3,000 bail. He entered his plea on Friday.
   On Dec. 29, Slater led authorities on a chase through West
Hollywood after he was clocked 15 mph above the 35 mph speed limit,
authorities said.
   The chase ended when the actor crashed his car into a pole,
authorities said.
   Tests showed the actor's blood contained .16 percent alcohol,
above the legal limit of .10.

<HEAD>Bush Kicks Off Election Season With Broadside at Castro, Ortega</HEAD>

   President Bush says the end of former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega's rule should be a lesson for the
``two holdouts preventing a totally democratic hemisphere,'' Cuba's
Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   ``So let Daniel Ortega and Fidel take note, like the dinosaur,
the day of the dictator is over,'' Bush declared to a standing
ovation at a Republican dinner.
   Bush, who celebrates the first anniversary of his inauguration
today in the privacy of the presidential retreat in Camp David,
Md., kicked off the off-year election season by appearing Friday
night at a $1,500-a-plate dinner for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's
November re-election effort.
   Speaking in the city where Noriega remains in custody awaiting
trial, Bush praised prosecutors for assembling a team ``to make
sure justice prevails.''
   ``The world in January 1990 is a very different place than it
was in January 1989,'' Bush declared.
   He cited the end of totalitarian rule throughout Eastern Europe
and said that ``a dictator resigned in Panama. Now the people rule
in Panama.''
   Bush said Castro and Ortega are ``swimming against the tide.''
His remarks produced sustained applause from his audience in a city
where anti-Castro sentiment remains high.
   The president earlier Friday toured a section of the Everglades
and spoke to a homebuilders' convention in Atlanta.
   With a group of local sixth graders in tow, the president spent
nearly two hours at the Royal Palm visitor center in the Everglades
National Park, listening to a lecture from a park ranger and
walking along elevated wooden trails to inspect alligators,
turtles, fish, birds and other wildlife.
   ``I guess you all can go away realizing you have to protect this
resource,'' Bush told the students.
   But he added, ``You can't stop everything from growing. You need
sound management.''
   Bush has set a goal of ``no-net-loss'' of wetlands, but the
administration has yet to produce a strategy to achieve that policy.
   A White House statement on Friday said a presidential task force
studying the matter will spend ``the coming months'' holding public
meetings around the country to solicit public comment before making
recommendations.
   Earlier Friday, Bush told the National Association of
Homebuilders in Atlanta, ``I am not satisfied'' with the prevailing
home mortgage rates of around 10 percent and wants to see lower
levels throughout the economy.
   ``We cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the
financial life of America's young people. And when it comes to
housing, this must not become a society of `haves' and `have
nots,''' Bush said.
   The homebuilders are experiencing a slump, with housing starts _
construction of new homes and apartments _ hitting their lowest
level last year since the 1982 recession.
   The administration over the past few days has been leaning on
the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, amid reports that
momentum for easier credit at the central bank may be ebbing.

   Comedian George Burns, who turns 94 today,
says his health is good.
   ``From the hips up, I'm OK. Until you get to the top of my head,
where I have to wear toupees. But then, I've been wearing toupees
since the '20s.''
   Burns continues his heavy work schedule, with one-nighters and
casino appearances planned for this year and beyond. He has
postponed a date in Las Vegas, where musicians are striking _ ``I
won't walk through the picket line.''
   Burns brags that his last two books, ``Gracie, a Love Story''
and ``All My Best Friends,'' made the best-seller list, and he is
mulling over a murder mystery with co-writer David Fisher. Also in
the works: another ``Oh God!'' movie.
   The comic planned to celebrate his birthday at a restaurant with
his show biz chums, including Milton Berle, Carol Channing, Danny
Thomas, Dinah Shore and Don Rickles.

   Johnny Carson was so frightened of a
former mental patient who allegedly threatened him that he hired
off-duty police to guard his house around the clock, Carson said.
   Carson testifed Thursday at a preliminary hearing that he
received at least five letters and tapes _ the letters signed ``Ken
Orville Gause, the Baron KOG'' _ which threatened him and his staff
if he refused to hand over millions of dollars.
   Gause, a Milwaukee resident, had been seen at his house and at
NBC's Burbank studios where ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny
Carson'' is taped, Carson said.
   He was arrested Dec. 5 in the lobby of the studios. Authorities
said Gause carried a sock filled with gravel and had Carson's
address in his possession when he was arrested.
   Burbank Municipal Judge Marion E. Gubler ordered Gause, 36, to
stand trial in August on 10 counts of extortion and making
terrorist threats. Gause is to be arraigned Feb. 2 and remains in
custody on $250,000 bail.

   Country singer Reba McEntire has plenty
of stage experience, but she found acting harder than anything
she'd done before except for farming.
   McEntire plays a heavily armed survivalist in a supporting part
in the movie ``Tremors,'' starring Kevin Bacon.
   ``It's the hardest work I've ever had in life, except for
gathering cattle at age 14,'' she said.
   ``But once you're on a stage and acting out the words to the
songs each night for the fans, the acting didn't come hard for me
at all,'' she said Thursday.
   McEntire, who is expecting her first child, is known for her
hits ``Whoever's in New England'' and ``Cathy's Clown.'' She was
voted female vocalist of the year by the Country Music Association
from 1984 through 1987.

   Artists Andrew and Jamie Wyeth took
actor Charlton Heston and his son on an illustrated tour of
``Treasure Island.''
   Heston and his son, Fraser, on Thursday traveled to Brandywine
River Museum for a look at patriarch N.C. Wyeth's drawings for the
novel. The museum is exhibiting 18 of Wyeth's illustrations.
   Fraser Heston recently directed a made-for-TV movie of the
famous adventure novel, starring his father as Long John Silver,
for the Turner Broadcasting Network. The Hestons then hosted a
private viewing of the new movie for the Wyeths.
   In 1911, N.C. Wyeth's illustrations depicted Robert Louis
Stevenson's tale of a strange island, populated by sinister pirates
and a young adventurous boy.

relationships with actors, and will have her eye on others.
   ``In the words of my people, `Never again,''' Grey told US

   Grey, best known for her role in ``Dirty Dancing,'' went out

Depp for nine months. She described the two as ``lovely boys.''
   The actress said the naive character she played in ``Dirty
Dancing'' is not her. ``Sometimes I think I did too good a job
because people think that's who I am,'' she said. ``I was never
that innocent in my whole life. Ever. Ever!''

yacht.
   The current Trump Princess _ recognized in the Guinness Book of

small for the Trumps to entertain guests, Trump spokesman Jeff
Walker said.
   The new 420-foot version, which he expects to unveil in 1992,
will be fitted with a Roman bath and amphitheater.
   Meantime, Trump is looking for a buyer of the old yacht. He paid
$30 million for it; his asking price is $115 million.

   Actor Todd Bridges of TV's old series
``Diff'rent Strokes'' is headed for a second legal battle with his
former accountant.
   Bridges sued Larry W. Risse, a Sherman Oaks accountant, for
allegedly concealing assets when the two settled another lawsuit
accusing the accountant of embezzling $400,000.
   Bridges contends in the lawsuit filed Thursday in Superior Court
that he never would have agreed to the 1988 settlement had he known
Risse and his wife had more in assets than their home.
   The lawsuit alleges fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
   Calls to Risse's office on Friday went unanswered.
   Bridges, who played Willis Jackson on ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was
acquitted last year of attempted murder in a shooting that
critically injured a man.

   The pilot of an Eastern Airlines jet that crashed
into a smaller plane didn't see it ahead on the runway until the
last minute because he had been watching another jetliner that
landed in front of them, federal investigators said Friday.
   A Continental Airlines jet had been cleared to land on the same
runway ahead of the twin-engine Beechcraft Air King, which was
struck from behind by the Eastern Boeing 727-200, said Robert
MacIntosh, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   The accident at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport late
Thursday killed the pilot of the smaller plane and injured the
co-pilot. There were no other injuries reported.
   ``We were on the ground, and we were in stopping mode, and
suddenly there they were,'' said the pilot, 23-year Eastern veteran
Ralph Orlando. ``But we couldn't fly anymore. We weren't at flying
speed anymore, and we had our speed brakes deployed. We couldn't
have possibly lifted over it.''
   ``My first instinct was to try to avoid contact. So I made a
sharp left turn to avoid it. But that wasn't enough. But I also had
a plane of people to consider,'' said Orlando.
   The pilot didn't explain why he hadn't seen the small plane
sooner.
   Just before the Eastern jet overran the Beechcraft plane at
about 7:10 p.m., the air traffic controller told the Continental
pilot to stop between runways after he had cleared the airport's
northernmost runway, MacIntosh said at a news conference.
   All three planes had been cleared to land on the runway, and all
three pilots were tuned into the same radio frequency with the
controller, he said.
   MacIntosh said the controller told Easter pilot Orlando, that he
had his plane in sight.
   Shortly after that transmission, the controller asked the
Continental plane to ``hold short'' of the parallel runway, an
order MacIntosh said meant the plane should stop between the two
runways. He said investigators had yet to determine why that order
was given.
   The Continental pilot, who has yet to be identified, did not
immediately acknowledge the instruction and the tower controllers
discussed among themselves whether they thought the pilot had heard
it, MacIntosh said. Shortly thereafter, the Eastern pilot reported
having hit the Beechcraft.
   ``The captain (of the Eastern flight) stated he had been looking
down the runway in some awareness of the Continental. He saw the
tail of the (Beechcraft) aircraft a very short time before
impact,'' MacIntosh said.
   MacIntosh said investigators do not know why the Eastern pilot
was not aware of the Beechcraft until just before the accident. He
said the Eastern pilot did not acknowledge hearing the controller's
instructions clearing the Beechcraft for landing.
   ``I'm certainly not in position to judge error yet,'' he said,
adding, ``It would be absolutely glib for me to opinionize on what
should have taken place.''
   MacIntosh said investigators would spend the weekend examining
the cockpit recorder tapes and studying the distances between the
planes, the approaches of the plane and the controller's conduct.
   Earlier Friday, Eastern said its pilot had been cleared to land
and didn't see the smaller plane ``until he was right on top of
him.''
   Another NTSB spokesman, Drucella Andersen, said that under
aircraft approach rules, ``the arriving aircraft cannot be cleared
to land until the preceding aircraft has left the runway.''
   ``We won't speculate as to what this might mean. I can't tell
you what the cause is,'' Ms. Andersen said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker said,
``It's not unusual for the tower to clear more than one airplane to
land. The pilots must adjust to whatever conditions arise.''
   The normal landing procedure for a line of planes is to keep a
distance of three to six miles between each of them in the air,
Barker said. The rule is designed to give the first plane time to
land, roll out and clear the runway before the next plane crosses
the runway boundary.
   If for some reason the first plane does not clear the runway,
the second plane is supposed to go into a ``missed approach
procedure'' and go around the first plane, Barker said. But Eastern
spokesman Jim Ashlock said the Eastern pilot did not see the first
plane in time to take evasive action.
   ``He was cleared to land and that tells him, `my runway is clear
and I can come on in,''' Ashlock said.
   The Eastern jet, rolling down the runway at 120 mph, sheared off
the roof of the twin-propeller plane, which was owned by Epps Air
Service and based at a suburban airport, authorities said. There
were no injuries to the Eastern plane's 141 passengers and crew of
eight.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said there was a little rain and
fog at the airport Thursday evening, but ``it was not bad weather.''
   Ashlock said he did not know who was at the controls at the time
of the accident, but he said the entire Eastern crew had extensive
flying experience.
   Orlando had been a pilot for Eastern since 1967, he said. The
first officer, co-pilot Michael D. Runyan, hired by Eastern last
March, had 7,388 hours of flying time and second officer Henry
Stanford, hired by Eastern last April, had 5,430 hours flying
experience, Ashlock said.
   Both planes Friday remained on the runway, which was closed.

   Soviet troops broke through blockades set up by
ethnic extremists in downtown Baku early Saturday and killed at
least seven people in street battles, a spokeswoman for a militant
Azerbaijani group said.
   State Radio Moscow later Saturday announced that the Presidium
of the national Supreme Soviet, the government's top executive
body, had declared a state of emergency in Baku because of the
``sharp aggravation of the situation'' that it blamed on ``criminal
extremist forces'' in the city.
   The radio confirmed that military units entered Baku, saying
they were fired on by ``militants of the Popular Front'' of
Azerbaijan and ``were forced to retaliate.'' It said casualties had
been reported but did not give a figure.
   The spokeswoman said two pitched battles were fought inside the
Azerbaijani capital, leaving at least seven Azerbaijanis dead.
   ``It's very dangerous on the street,'' she said. ``Battles are
still going on.''
   The official news agency Tass carried no reports of troops
fighting in Baku, an oil center and port of 1.8 million residents
on the Caspian Sea. Western reporters have not been allowed to go
to the scene since the ethnic violence flared a week ago.
   The army intervention, the first such combat reported in Baku
involving Soviet soldiers, came after ethnic riots turned into open
warfare between Azerbaijani and Armenian militants. Bad blood
between the two peoples goes back centuries.
   If the latest deaths are confirmed, the toll now would be at
least 79 people killed and more than 220 wounded.
   Army and internal security troops poured into the southern
republics for days, but had not entered Baku until shortly after
midnight Friday.
   Leila Unusova, a spokeswoman for an organization calling itself
the Azerbaijani Social Democrat Group, reported by telephone from
Baku that Soviet troops surrounded a square near the Communist
Party headquarters building where about 30,000 Azerbaijanis
gathered in an antigovernment protest.
   She said the forces had armored personnel carriers, water cannon
and other military equipment but she did not know if soldiers at
the square opened fire.
   ``Our citizens blockaded roads on the south and north with cars
and buses,'' she told The Associated Press. ``Young people, 20 to
25 years old, were there,'' manning the barricades.
   She said that shortly after midnight, Soviet army units entered
the city from the north and from a base inside the Baku military
academy and fired on the militants' positions.
   A doctor told her two young men were killed in one street battle
and five to seven others died at another site.
   Wounded were being taken to three city hospitals, the
spokeswoman reported, hours after fighting broke out.
   About 5,000 regular army troops and thousands more Interior
Ministry soldiers and police had moved into the troubled areas to
try to restore order, but Soviet authorities were reluctant to
engage the militants directly.
   The military's violent breakup of a nationalist demonstration in
Tbilisi, Georgia, last April, in which 19 people were killed,
touched off a national scandal. And a Defense Ministry callup of
reservists to reinforce military units on Thursday was abruptly
suspended a day later in the face of widespread public protest.
   An American journalist in Moscow spoke by telephone before dawn
Saturday to a spokesman for the Azerbaijani People's Front in Baku,
who said Soviet soldiers were engaged in street fighting and
doctors were told to stand by.
   The sounds of gunfire could be heard in the background over the
telephone, said the U.S. journalist, Los Angeles Times
correspondent Masha Hamilton. Phone connections to the Caucasus
from Moscow have been cut much of this week, making confirmation of
reported fighting extremely difficult.
   Moscow Radio said reinforcements were being sent to Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   Earlier Friday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed extremists
opposed to his reforms for the ethnic warfare in the Caucasus and
said some Azerbaijanis were calling for a separate Islamic state.
   His comments came as Azerbaijanis reportedly brought arms into
the country over the border they have forced open with Iran. Others
rallied in Baku, with some calling for the violent overthrow of
Soviet power and a union of the predominantly Moslem republic with
Iran's Azerbaijan region, Tass said.
   Many of the troops sent to the southern republics have been
unable to reach their destinations because hundreds of Azerbaijanis
have blocked airports and roads with trucks and buses, opposing
what they view as Kremlin interference.
   Despite attempts by the troops to maintain order in Armenia and
Azerbaijan, Gorbachev said the situation was not improving
following six days of battles.
   ``It's still difficult. People's lives are in danger,''
Gorbachev told British TV.
   A Moscow Radio broadcast said Friday that ``additional
contingents'' of troops were being brought into Armenia and
Azerbaijan and ``new sub-units'' of Interior Ministry troops had
arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-dominated enclave in
Azerbaijan. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan claim the territory.
   Gorbachev told a conference on his reforms that the warfare
served the interests of ``a group of extremists, irresponsible
adventurists and representatives of the shadow economy.'' The
shadow economy refers to the billions of rubles of illegal trade
transacted outside the state-run economy.
   ``Perestroika is a bone in their throat, but they can't oppose
it directly, so they clutch at tension on an ethnic basis,''
Gorbachev said, according to Tass.
   Tass said Gorbachev also blamed Azerbaijani extremists who are
``calling for the republic to secede from the U.S.S.R., for an
Islamic Azerbaijan.'' But, he added, ``among the people they are
not receiving support.''
   Tass said demonstrators in Baku called for secession from the
Soviet Union and the unification of Soviet Azerbaijan with its
Iranian counterpart ``under the flag of a single Islamic state.''
   People who didn't agree were threatened with violence, Tass said.
   The People's Front newspaper, called Freedom, charged Moscow
with provoking the ethnic warfare, the government newspaper
Izvestia said.
   Other Soviet media made Baku sound as if it had been virtually
taken over by the Azerbaijani People's Front. Members have captured
offices of the KGB, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor,
destroying documents and trying to seize weapons, according to
Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow.
   Extremists blockaded the Communist Party leadership's
headquarters and demanded the government resign, the Azerbaijani
news agency Azerinform reported.
   Baku was paralyzed Friday as workers struck to press demands
that Soviet troops be withdrawn from the city and to protest plans
for a curfew, said Savili Peretz, Azerinform's deputy director.
   Most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslems, and most Armenians are
Christians. They have been fighting, striking and demonstrating
sporadically for two years in a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. The
latest round of violence began Jan. 13 with anti-Armenian riots in
Baku.
   The unrest worsened on the Iranian border, where Azerbaijanis
destroyed guard posts, fences and security alarms this month in a
drive to reunite with their ethnic neighbors.
   Despite checks by border guards, Azerbaijanis brought weapons
across the border from Iran, Izvestia reported Friday.
   Izvestia said extremists commandeered three trains carrying
soldiers and military equipment in Azerbaijan.
   Tass reported three people were killed and four wounded Friday
in an Azerbaijani attack in Yeraskh in the Armenian republic on the
border with the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan.
   It was the first report of Azerbaijani attackers crossing into
Armenia.

<HEAD>Atwater Tells GOP to Tell It Straight on Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater says
the party welcomes candidates on both sides of the divisive
abortion debate and warns they risk all but certain defeat if they
try to avoid the issue.
   ``There is no litmus test,'' Atwater said Friday in his keynote
address to the Republican National Committee's winter meeting,
which was dominated by discussion of how the GOP can blunt the
Democrats' successful use of abortion against Republicans last year.
   Atwater said he and President Bush would stick to their
anti-abortion positions but said ``we both understand that a great
national party is built on many individuals'' with different views.
   ``Our party is big enough to accept different views on many
different issues,'' Atwater said, calling the internal debate over
abortion one of the ``growing pains'' of trying to become a
majority party.
   This year's state elections are considered especially important
because they will determine which party will control congressional
redistricting based on the 1990 census.
   ``In 1990 no candidate can run for public office without
squarely facing the abortion issue,'' Atwater said.
   Democrats running in 1989 for governor and lieutenant governor
of Virginia, governor of New Jersey and mayor of New York won by
pressing their pro-choice positions against GOP candidates who had
anti-abortion records. Apparent attempts by the Republicans to
moderate their stances were ridiculed by Democrats, who Atwater
said ``pulled a reverse twist on us'' by borrowing a key Atwater
election strategy.
   ``They defined our candidates before they defined themselves and
that's almost always fatal,'' Atwater said. ``What no voter likes
is vacillating, waffling or double talk.''
   At a news conference after his speech, Atwater said he, Bush and
the national party would work diligently for pro-choice Republicans
despite differences on abortion. Other Republicans should also put
party loyalty first, he said.
   He said that in private sessions with the GOP leaders _ talks
dominated by abortion politics _ ``there seems to be a consensus''
to welcome pro-choice GOP candidates without abandoning the party's
anti-abortion plank.
   An attempt by one RNC member to get the meeting to reaffirm that
plank failed Thursday. Other participants said it was best to avoid
such a move because of the problems it could cause some candidates.
   Bush, however, shows no signs of keeping his anti-abortion views
under wraps.
   He vetoed two bills last year that would have allowed the use of
federal funds for abortions in cases of rape and incest and the
White House said Friday that Bush will address a rally of abortion
foes via telephone Monday, the 17th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion.

   During the two-week festival, the mimes are performing in
theaters, concert halls, local community arts centers,
universities, even a library, in London and in towns across England.
   ``We have probably presented every major mime in the world,''
festival director Joseph Seelig claimed in an interview.
   Mime is entertainment without words, a form of theater practiced
by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Seelig called it ``the art of
creating illusion in silence, without props or music, just the
body.''
   The world's best-known mime is probably Frenchman Marcel
Marceau, who wears the white makeup of a clown, a striped jersey
and a tall hat, and makes you believe he is climbing the stairs
when there are none.
   ``Marceau has one style, but he is so famous he has eclipsed the
others,'' Seelig said. ``Charlie Chaplin was a mime, but nobody
thinks of that.''
   ``Because of Marceau, people think mime in France is bound to be
the best and popular, but it isn't so. Mime is wonderful in Eastern
Europe, and there are splendid American mimes.''
   Dan Kamin, a busy American performer, has his own show at the
festival called ``Confessions of an Illusionist.'' His book,
``Charlie Chaplin's One-Man Show,'' is regarded by many in the
profession as the definitive study of Chaplin's art.
   Mime blossomed in Czechoslovakia because under the old Hapsburg
Empire, the Austrian rulers made German the official language.
Actors circumvented the prohibition on their own languages in
theaters with mime theater, which didn't need a license.
   Seelig called the Czech mime Bolek Polivka, who is taking part
in the festival, ``the greatest clown of our time.''
   Polivka and his partner, Chantal Poulain, work with every
theatrical trick in the book: costumes, masks, puppets and illusion.
   Michael Stanwood and Jim Jackson of Denver ask in their ``Mimic
Sole'' show: ``Is it art, or are you just having a good time?''
   To the accompaniment of Stanwood's autoharp, keyboards and car
spring, Jackson juggles, dances on a tightrope and traps the unwary
in gigantic soap bubbles.
   Between festivals, Seelig travels to see new acts and listen out
for tips on who is new and good.
   ``Nineteen of 20 are a dead loss, but the one can be something
very exciting,'' he said. ``Mime is a small world.''
   Helen Lannaghan, the festival co-director, said the budget is
small and dependent on box office receipts, with some help from the
state-funded Arts Council. Income from all sources is $165,000.
   This year's festival opened Jan. 15 and runs through Jan. 28.

<HEAD>State Losing Millions In Fake Medi-Cal Diaper Claims</HEAD>

   ``Sticker bandits'' who found a loophole
in a state health care plan for the poor may be cheating taxpayers
out of more than $100 million a year, a published report said.
   All it takes to become a Medi-Cal ``provider'' is to ask the
state for a number and start sending in bills, said Carlo
Michelotti, who heads Medi-Cal's anti-fraud efforts.
   Under Medi-Cal, those who qualify for state-paid care each month
get a card with five identification stickers. When they receive
medicine or medical supplies, they pay by handing over a sticker,
and the pharmacy or store then bills the state.
   But hundreds of people are stealing or buying the stickers,
using them to authenticate phony orders for diapers, rubber sheets
and pants and other incontinence supplies and then charging the
state, the San Jose Mercury News reported.
   These supplies are especially difficult for medical specialists
to keep track of, Michelotti said.
   ``A diaper is a buck a pop,'' he said. ``It's a pretty innocuous
thing.''
   ``The crooks have discovered a weakness in the system, and
they're busy driving trucks through it,'' said Steve Adler, chief
of the state Justice Department's Medi-Cal fraud bureau.
   The amount being stolen in diaper scams is enough to pay for two
doctor visits for every one of California's 3.3 million Medi-Cal
recipients, according to the newspaper. The state reimbursement is
about $1 a diaper.
   Over the past nine months, the Justice Department's Medi-Cal
fraud unit has been investigating seven alleged diaper bandit
cases, each involving millions of dollars. Last fall, the owner and
four employees of an Oakland company were arrested and accused of
defrauding the state of $9 million. The case has not yet gone to
court.
   State health officials suspected rip-offs after the yearly
payments for diapers and other incontinence supplies quadrupled in
two straight years _ from $30 million to $120 million.
   For the current fiscal year, officials expect the bill to reach
at least $150 million _ of which only $35 million is legitimate.
   Fifty people every week apply to become Medi-Cal providers,
compared to about one application a week a few years ago,
Michelotti said.
   Medi-Cal hopes for new rules sometime this year to allow the
screening of applicants. Until then, thousands of bills will be
paid without question, he said.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega have forced the U.S.
government to protect documents confiscated from the homes and
offices of the ousted Panamanian leader and provide a list of the
papers to the defense.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff made the ruling Friday after
defense attorney Steven Kollin filed an emergency motion requesting
the move.
   Kollin stated in his motion that Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles
Malman traveled to Panama City to inspect material belonging to
Noriega that was seized by U.S. troops during the invasion last
month that removed Noriega from power.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan refused to discuss
Malman's trip to Panama, but didn't object to the order.
   It would be nearly impossible to determine which of the
documents would have direct bearing on Noriega's drug trafficking
case, Sullivan said, calling the defense motion unrealistic.
   But Turnoff ordered that the documents be protected and an
inventory done. But he told Kollin the defense must give more
specific information on the addresses of Noriega's homes in Panama
City and Rio Hato and disclose which offices he occupied in the
Panama defense Forces headquarters and Fort Amador.
   The magistrate said the inventory of documents from Noriega's
houses must be available by Thursday, the day before Noriega's bond
hearing. Turnoff said that was because the defense contended some
evidence from the homes may bear on the hearing.
   Earlier Friday, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cautioned
both sides to avoid intimidation in the case of Noriega
co-defendant Luis del Cid. But Hoeveler refused to order government
investigators to keep away from defense witnesses in that case.
   An attorney for del Cid complained that investigators from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service visited the defendant's wife
and two friends shortly after the three testified at a bond hearing
Tuesday, and intimidated them about their residency.
   Del Cid's wife, Tilsa del Cid, is Panamanian. The other two
women, Norma and Eglantina Alvarez, are Nicaraguan refugees.
   Hoeveler noted that the three women had offered to take custody
of del Cid if he is freed on bond.
   ``It is important for me to get the full picture of what their
status is,'' Hoeveler said. But he added: ``No investigator for
either side can intimidate witnesses.''

<HEAD>Barry, Advisors to Debate His Political Future in Wake of Drug
Charges</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry's top aide is running the
city government while political advisers assess the mayor's future
in the wake of his arrest on a federal cocaine possession charge.
   Barry, who said he is innocent of the crime, wept Friday when he
told his cabinet he was turning over most of the reins of District
of Columbia government to his city administrator.
   Barry's arrest late Thursday in an FBI ``sting'' operation at a
Washington hotel for allegedly smoking crack and his appearance
before a federal magistrate Friday threw the city government into
turmoil and threatened to end his political career.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens told reporters a court-ordered blood
test administered to Barry after his arrest came back positive.
   Barry's advisers, many of whom have weathered years of federal
investigations targeting Barry, were meeting again today to debate
whether he can still consider running for a fourth term.
   His aides were deeply divided at stormy meetings Friday over
whether the mayor should give up at least part of his duties and
seek drug treatment, according to a source familiar with the
sessions who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The source said Barry's cabinet assembled in a contentious
session while the mayor met with some his own advisers. Barry
eventually joined the full cabinet meeting, rejecting suggestions
that he enter a treatment program but telling his staff in a
tearful statement that he would give up day-to-day operations to
City Administrator Carol B. Thompson.
   Barry's office said in a statement that the change in government
was based on the mayor's ``need for time to handle his legal
affairs, his concern for his family, and because it is in the best
interests of the citizens of Washington, D.C.''
   The mayor canceled a rally scheduled for Sunday at which he was
to formally announce his candidacy for re-election.
   Jesse Jackson, whose April move to Washington sparked rumors he
would run for mayor, said in Chicago that he was stunned by Barry's
arrest and hoped the case would be tried ``in the courtroom, not
the newsrooms.''
   ``I think at this point it's inappropriate to talk about the
politics of the matter and the legal options until we get all the
information about just what has happened,'' he said.
   A stone-faced Barry and his wife, Effi, walked through a sea of
reporters outside the federal courthouse to get to his hearing
before U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson. He was released on
personal bond and told he must submit to a urine test once a week.
   Outside the courthouse, Barry declined comment on the case or
his political future, and his lawyer said he would plead innocent
to the misdemeanor charge. If convicted, the mayor could face
penalties of up to one year in jail and a $100,000 fine, said
Stephens.
   He faces another court appearance Feb. 5.
   Barry was lured to the FBI-rented room by an ex-lover who agreed
to cooperate with investigators, said a law enforcement who spoke
on condition of anonymity. The woman was identified by sources
familiar with the case as Rasheeda Moore. One source said Ms. Moore
agreed to cooperate after she got into trouble with state
authorities in California.
   According to court papers filed by federal prosecutors, the room
was watched through a surveillance camera and Barry was taped as he
gave ``a quantity of currency'' to a cooperating witness in return
for the crack and smoked the cocaine in a pipe.
   Federal agents then entered the hotel room and arrested the
mayor.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted a law
enforcement source who said Barry ``was shocked, shocked ...
totally taken aback'' when the agents moved in.
   At City Hall, other elected officials struggled to assure city
workers and residents alike that the government will function
despite the crisis created by Barry's arrest.
   ``It is very important that we retain some sense of normalcy,''
said city council member Betty Ann Kane after a closed meeting to
discuss the crisis. ``It was very somber in there, (with) people
still in a state of shock. Everyone is concerned about being able
to reassure people that the city is not going to fall apart.''
   Stephens dismissed suggestions the mayor may have been unfairly
entrapped in the hotel ``sting'' operation.
   The ``carefully planned, carefully reviewed and carefully
executed'' undercover operation was ``scrupulously fair to the
defendant, Mr. Barry,'' Stephens said. ``There was no entrapment
there.''
   But many observers said the legal questions about the case are
outweighed by the political damage the arrest will cause.
   Jeffrey Gildenhorn, a fundraiser for Barry's reelection effort,
likened the mayor's arrest to the mood of the President Nixon's
White House as the pressures of Watergate mounted in 1974.
   ``I feel at this point a similar despair,'' Gildenhorn said.

   Two groups are asking a federal court to make
the government allow marijuana to be used for medical applications.
   Used as a drug for centuries, marijuana has been known to have
therapeutic potential for 150 years, but its been illegal in the
United States since 1937.
   For the past 15 years _ most recently last month _ the Drug
Enforcement Administration has rejected bids to make marijuana
available for such purposes as controlling nausea in cancer
patients and treatment of glaucoma.
   But groups went to federal court Friday to try to overturn the
DEA's latest decision and force the agency to change marijuana's
status as a Schedule I drug, which is available only for research,
to a Schedule II drug, which would make it available for patient
use.
   Only synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, is available on
Schedule II for use as a cancer chemotherapy anti-nauseant, and
Kevin Zeese, counsel for the Drug Policy Foundation, says it
doesn't work as well as the real thing.
   Studies by a half-dozen states comparing marijuana and the
synthetic THC for their anti-nausea properties found ``marijuana's
much more effective and much safer as well,'' said Zeese. The
foundation represented the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws and the Alliance for Cannibis Therapeutics in the
appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   Zeese said that when patients are given synthetic THC, ``a
patient takes the whole pill and is stuck with the whole pill,
whether he needs it or not.
   ``With THC, you're taking the pure drug, a much more
mind-altering substance. You see God on that stuff. It's like
tripping,'' Zeese said. ``Marijuana is something the patient can
control. A cancer patient will take two smokes off a marijuana
cigarette and that's all he needs.''
   The government provides marijuana for free in some cases when
the Food and Drug Administration approves use of the drug for
``compassionate'' medical purposes. However, medical marijuana
advocates say the process is time-consuming and discourages
physicians from applying for the right to prescribe the drug.
   The FDA said at least 24 ``compassionate'' applications have
been approved since the first in 1976, and some covered more than
one patient. Robert Randall of the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics, who suffers from glaucoma and was the first to get
the FDA's nod, said he and four other patients have the only
current government approval to use the drug.
   Zeese noted the latest appeal is the fifth time the issue has
gone to court, but said previous cases have been based more on
procedural matters.
   ``This is the first time (the case) is on the issue of whether
marijuana has medical value,'' Zeese said.
   The appeal targets the Dec. 29 decision by DEA Administrator
John C. Lawn that overturned a recommendation by DEA's chief
administrative law judge, Francis L. Young.
   Young, in recommending that marijuana be placed on the less
restrictive schedule, called the drug ``one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.''

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is calling
on college and university leaders to help ensure that advanced
education is available for any American who wants it, regardless of
race or economic status.
   He told the American Council on Education on Friday, ``By the
year 2000, students from all population segments and economic
groups who aspire to enter and complete programs of post-secondary
education (should) have equal access to a quality education.''
   The Bush administration and nation's governors are preparing
specific guidelines and timetables to improve learning mainly in
elementary and secondary schools, but Cavazos said higher education
leaders need to define their mission as well.
   ``Universities and colleges must assume leadership in
restructuring education in America today,'' he told about 1,200
educators in the luncheon speech.
   Cavazos declined to comment on an Associated Press story that
said President Bush will call in his State of the Union address for
guaranteed pre-school programs for disadvantaged children and for a
cut in dropout rates by about half by the end of the decade.
   Among the goals for advanced education, Cavazos proposed to:
   _Reduce by half the gap the degree completion rates between
black and Hispanic students, and white and Asian students.
   Cavazos noted 55 percent of blacks and 51 percent of Hispanics
who enter higher education do not earn degrees, compared with 33
percent of other students.
   _Make sure 50 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients are
able to demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language. About 10
percent of students now demonstrate such a proficiency.
   _Guarantee that all associate and bachelors' degree recipients
are proficient in college level math and science, can write
coherent, grammatically correct papers, display a basic knowledge
of world history, geography and culture, and have high critical
thinking and problem-solving skills.
   _Increase by 25 percent the number of college graduates
completing doctoral programs in the basic arts, mathematics,
sciences, engineering and technological disciplines, and by 50
percent the number of women, blacks, Indians and Hispanics in the
group.
   Cavazos stressed a special effort must be made in minority
teacher preparation.
   ``You must involve yourself in helping America restructure
elementary and secondary education,'' he said.
   ``I must remind you that the quality of the student that comes
to your university or college is totally dependent upon what is
occurring in the public elementary and secondary schools of America
today.''

<HEAD>Baker Makes Headway But Mideast Negotiations Remain Elusive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A first round of Mideast negotiations is still
beyond the reach of Secretary of State James A. Baker III after a
busy week of diplomacy.
   He wound up Friday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, who left ``cautiously optimistic'' that Baker would
succeed eventually.
   But the State Department gave no indication of a breakthrough in
a brief summary of their 45-minute meeting. And the Egyptian did
not claim one.
   Diplomatic sources said Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday brought Baker
Egypt's suggestions for hurdling a dispute over Palestinian
participation in negotiations and that Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin took them back to Jerusalem for consideration.
   No details were provided by the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Rabin was expected to follow up the proposals with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir while Israeli Finance
Minister Shimon Peres is due to meet in Cairo next week with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``I am cautiously optimistic about the outcome of this whole
exercise because there is a keen interest and awareness of the
necessity for peace for all of us in our area,'' Abdel-Meguid told
reporters after his third and final session with Baker.
   ``We have been discussing some very important points,'' he said.
``I am not in a position to say more about them.''
   Asked if the gap had been narrowed, he replied: ``I think yes.''
   Baker's intention is to have Abdel-Meguid and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens hold a three-way meeting with him in
Washington in late February.
   The main hurdle is what role, if any, is to be played by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel wants to keep the PLO out of the negotiations; Egypt is
working with Yasser Arafat's organization to try to gain a foothold
in the talks.
   Even as Baker pursued his diplomacy, the State Department took
another slap at Israel. It criticized the detention of Faisal
Husseini, a pro-PLO Palestinian activist, as detrimental to U.S.
peace efforts in the Middle East.
   Although spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S. officials had
not sorted out the allegations, she read a statement that said ``we
are surprised and disturbed'' by reports that Husseini and other
Palestinians had been detained.
   ``Such actions discourage Palestinian confidence in the peace
process and contribute to the prevailing atmosphere of distrust,''
the statement said.
   While criticizing Shamir on Tuesday the State Department also
faulted the Israeli policy of settling Jews on the West Bank and in
Gaza. Ms. Tutwiler said the establishment of new settlements or
expansion of existing ones did not promote the cause of peace.
   Asked if the settlements also were illegal _ a position taken by
the Carter administration _ the spokeswoman said the Bush
administration had not addressed the question.

<HEAD>Disclose Some Rare Threats, Airline-Government Session Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Threats against airlines _ real threats and
hoaxes _ are sparking debate between air carriers and the federal
government about whether the flying public should be kept informed.
   After a lengthy meeting Friday between officials of nine major
U.S. passenger airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration, an
apparent consensus emerged that on extremely rare occasions,
informing the public is ``the prudent thing to do.''
   But FAA Administrator James B. Busey said after the session that
his agency's official opposition remains unchanged, at least so far.
   ``Currently, the FAA believes that publicizing threats against
airlines would be counterproductive to the security process,''
Busey said.
   The meeting was prompted by the recent decisions by Northwest
and Delta Airlines to publicize threats against some flights. The
disclosures were an exception to the industry's usual practice of
taking such threats seriously and trying to nullify them _ but not
making them public.
   Busey called the meeting ``a listening session'' and said it
gave the airlines ``an opportunity to discuss the need, if any, for
changes in the current policy toward threats against airline
flights.''
   He said he believes ``these kinds of threats are most
effectively handled by security professionals who are in a position
to implement countermeasures.''
   Jim Buckhorn, an FAA spokesman, said that as the session ended,
``the consensus seemed to be that it wasn't a good thing to
publicize all threats but that they agreed there are instances
where it is the prudent thing to do.''
   Buckhorn said most of those present agreed it was not a good
idea to make public hoax telephone calls.
   ``There are 600 or so such calls each year,'' he said. ``Our
experience has shown that publicity simply encourages more hoax
telephone calls.''
   But Busey said keeping the lid on most threats does not mean the
safety of travelers is not fully taken into account.
   ``The flying public should be aware that if a threat is
determined to be specific, credible, and cannot be countered, the
targeted flight is cancelled,'' he said.
   Buckhorn said Busey will schedule a meeting later with
representatives of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a consumer
advocacy group which wants the FAA and the airlines to fully inform
the public when bomb threats are received.

<HEAD>Two Female Soldiers Refused To Enter Combat Zone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. military authorities are examining
possible charges against two female soldiers who refused to drive
other soldiers into downtown Panama City at the peak of the U.S.
invasion, according to Defense Department sources.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified,
told The Associated Press the women ``feared for their lives'' in
the mission, which involved ferrying troops into the sniper-filled
city after sunrise on the first day of the invasion.
   ``Tears were involved,'' said one source.
   The source cautioned that although charges may be considered for
such a thing as disobeying a direct order, that does not mean that
any would be brought. ``Charges are just being considered,'' the
source said.
   Army policy bars women from being sent into combat, but some 600
women were among the troops who invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to oust
dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   These women were members of units assigned ``support''
functions, not front-line combat roles, even though some of their
assignments resulted in females coming under fire.
   Capt. Linda Bray has gotten wide publicity for leading a
military police company engaged in a firefight before capturing a
Panamanian Defense Forces barracks and dog kennel.
   A Defense Department spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield,
declined to comment on the report that the women broke down in
tears and refused to drive into a combat area. He said he was
unable to speculate on any possible charges being brought against
the two women.
   ``U.S. Army officials are looking into the incident and will
determine what action, if any, is appropriate in the best interests
of the Army and the individuals concerned,'' Satterfield said.
   Asked about the details of the incident, the spokesman said the
two female soldiers ``were unable to make a trip to drive combat
soldiers'' in the early morning hours of Dec. 20.
   The two women were drivers assigned to the 193rd Support
Battalion, he said.
   ``The drivers' state of mind at the time was such that they felt
they would endanger the lives of the combat soldiers they were to
transport if they were to undertake the trip,'' Satterfield said.
   ``Because of the urgency of the mission, they were replaced by
soldiers assigned to the 193rd Infantry Brigade (Light), who
carried out the driving assignment,'' he added.
   The two women were returned to their unit and ``performed other
driver duties,'' the spokesman said.
   The women belonged to a battalion that was supposed to provide
support to all Army units normally assigned to Panama, as well as
the reinforcements brought in for the operation, Satterfield said.

   A twin-engine corporate jet crashed
while attempting to land in a downpour, killing all seven people
aboard, authorities said. One official said the pilot apparently
gave no indication of trouble.
   The 21-seat Gulfstream jet was arriving at the Little Rock
municipal airport late Friday afternoon when it hit a light tower
short of the runway, lost a wing and a wheel, spun to the ground
and disintegrated in a fireball, witnesses said. The jet carried
employees of an Eastman Kodak Co. subsidiary.
   ``The weather was atrocious,'' said Jim Keet of Little Rock, a
pilot who arrived on a commercial flight just before the jet's
crash. ``The problem was visibility. The air was stable, but you
couldn't see the ground until just as you landed.''
   Airport manager James Rodgers said he did not believe the pilot
gave any indication of trouble.
   ``In normal airport operation, we make pilots aware of local
weather and a decision to shoot an approach is up to him,'' Rodgers
said. Airport officials do not make recommendations about an
approach and, so far as he knew, there had been no thought about
closing the airport because of the weather, Rodgers said.
   ``The airplane broke apart on impact,'' said Coroner Steve
Nawojczyk.
   The victim's bodies were scattered for 200 yards, he said.
   Charley Rogers, who was driving on a highway which passes the
airport, said he saw the plane ``hit some guy wires or something _
I saw sparks. It looked sort of red and blue. When the plane hit
the ground, it just exploded. All I saw was the explosion. There
were sparks up in the air, so it did hit something in the air.''
   The plane had departed Longview, Texas, earlier in the day en
route to Batesville, Ark., said Bill Edwards, a spokesman for
Tennessee Eastman in Kingsport, Tenn. Eastman's Chemical Division
headquarters is in Kingsport. The firm has an Arkansas Eastman
plant at Batesville.
   The plane was unable to land there because of weather conditions
and was diverted to Little Rock.
   Gary McDonald, manager of community relations for Arkansas
Eastman, identified the dead as: M.L. ``Bud'' Gernert, retired
Arkansas Eastman president, and his wife, Marian, and company
employees William Schirmer, Randy Wood, Nathan Casteel, and company
pilots Don Mason and Ed O'Neal.
   Arkansas Eastman, which manufactures chemicals and bulk aspirin
for Bayer, is a division of Eastman Kodak's Eastman Chemicals
Division.
   Jack Goodwyn, director of public and government affairs for
Texas Eastman in Longview, said the plane flew from Kingsport to
Longview and that three people are believed to have gotten off at
that point.
   Texas Eastman Plant Manager Paul Folzenlogan and his wife got
off the plane at Longview.
   ``I feel very lucky and blessed,'' Folzenlogan said.

<HEAD>Ex-Justice, Labor Secretary, U.N. Envoy Dies at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur J. Goldberg, whose lifetime of public
service was capped by his pivotal seat on the Supreme Court, will
be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
   Goldberg was found dead Friday by his maid when she entered his
apartment. He was 81. His physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said
Goldberg died overnight of cardiac arrest from coronary artery
disease.
   Henry Fleisher, a longtime friend who said he had lunch with
Goldberg on Wednesday, said the former justice was found lying on a
sofa, where he apparently had been reading a newspaper.
   Goldberg lived alone since his wife, the former Dorothy Kurgans,
died in February 1988 at age 79. She was an artist and author.
   The couple had two children, Barbara and Robert.
   Ralph DeStefano, director of Gawler's Funeral Home, said
Goldberg will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
   Appointed to the Supreme Court on Aug. 29, 1962, by President
Kennedy after 19 months as secretary of labor, Goldberg left the
bench three years later at the urging of President Johnson.
   Johnson then named Goldberg U.N. ambassador on July 20, 1965,
after the death of Adlai E. Stevenson at a time when U.S.
involvement in Vietnam was escalating dramatically.
   Goldberg wrote Johnson:
   ``I shall not, Mr. President, conceal the pain with which I
leave the court. ... It has been the richest and most satisfying
period of my career.''
   On the court, Goldberg was allied with Chief Justice Earl Warren
and other liberals who asserted the court's authority against other
government institutions and expanded its role as a protector of
individual rights.
   His appointment to the court provided the critical fifth liberal
vote needed for many of those decisions.
   Justice William J. Brennan, a fellow liberal who served with
Goldberg, said Friday that the former justice ``was very human, a
man of dignity and courtly bearing, punctilious, courteous,
cultivated, a superb host.''
   In perhaps his most controversial Supreme Court opinion,
Goldberg spoke for the court in a 5-4 ruling that threw out a
confession by a murder suspect who was denied a lawyer during
police questioning even though the suspect repeatedly asked to see
his lawyer.
   Goldberg wrote: ``If the exercise of constitutional rights will
thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there
is something very wrong with that system.''
   Goldberg repeatedly defended the right of the poor to legal
safeguards and due process.
   In contrast to his Supreme Court years, Goldberg's tenure at the
United Nations was frustrating. He resigned in April 1968,
separated from the center of power in the administration and with
United States mired in the war in Southeast Asia.
   Goldberg, after returning to the practice of law in New York,
was defeated by Republican Nelson A. Rockefeller in the 1970 race
for governor of New York.
   In 1971, Goldberg returned to Washington to practice law and
teach at American University. He remained active in public life.
   He was appointed by President Carter as U.S. ambassador to a
35-nation conference in Belgrade on human rights and headed a
private commission that studied the role of U.S. Jewish groups
during the Holocaust.
   Goldberg was born in Chicago on Aug. 8, 1908, the last of 11
children of Russian immigrant parents. His father, Joseph Goldberg,
ran a business carting fruits and vegetables from the city's
markets to hotels.
   After graduating from Northwestern University Law School in 1929
at the top of his class, Goldberg became a specialist in labor law.
   When his appointment to the high court was announced, Goldberg's
wife confided to reporters what was generally believed: the job was
the one her husband always wanted.

   James Carpenter got a tax refund check a
little early this year _ or 40 years late, depending on your
perspective.
   Carpenter was rummaging through his late mother's papers and
found a check from the Internal Revenue Service worth $122.40 that
he had asked her to hold for safekeeping. It was dated April 21,
1950.
   ``I dang near fell over, I was so surprised,'' he said. ``My mom
was one who would stick things away like birthday cards. I probably
gave it to her for her to hang onto for me. She sure did.''
   Each year the IRS receives calls from people who find old
checks, said Elcy Maccani, a spokeswoman for its Detroit office.
   ``I've had people call before with old checks, but this is one
of the oldest I've heard of,'' she said.
   Carpenter, 61, a custodian at Bay Medical Center, can take the
check to an IRS office and receive a voucher for the $122.40. After
the IRS verifies that the check had not been reported lost and then
replaced, it would reissue him a new one, Maccani said.
   The IRS began a new policy in October that makes all government
checks void after one year. The policy also states that old
government checks must be cashed by Sept. 30, 1990.

   Neither rain nor snow nor dark of night is

free-roaming pit-bull shepherd and Great Dane are another matter.
   Mail service to a northeast Spokane neighborhood was suspended
Jan. 10 when mailman George Finster said he was tired of being
charged by Virginia Provost's menacing dogs.
   For the past week and a half, two dozen neighbors on Provost's
block have had to collect their mail from the post office.
   ``This is probably the worst case we've had,'' said Gail Mackie,
executive director of SpokAnimal, the city's animal control agency.
   ``We're dealing with an owner who couldn't give a rip. They cut
off her mail and she got a post office box.''
   Starting Friday, an animal-control officer is accompanying
Finster on his route.
   Assistant City Attorney Stan Schwartz said he is researching an
ordinance that would prohibit dog ownership for people who are
convicted too often of allowing their animals to run free.

<HEAD>Agency Upgrades Probe of Escort, Lynx Restraint Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it is stepping up a probe
of possible torso belt failures in the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx
that consumers have blamed for five deaths and 76 injuries.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday
that it was upgrading its investigation from a paperwork-based
preliminary evaluation to an engineering analysis in which
engineers will study the possibly defective parts.
   ``We've received numerous reports which allege malfunction or
failure of the passive restraint system,'' said agency spokesman
Tim Hurd.
   The investigation involves the 1987, 1988 and 1989 Escort and
the 1987 Lynx, Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Linda Becker said. An
estimated 1,029,312 are on the road. The Lynx was discontinued
after 1987.
   The agency and the automaker have received 316 complaints
between them that blame the belts for five deaths and 76 injuries
resulting from accidents, Hurd said.
   Ford is cooperating with the investigation and company engineers
are inspecting the Escort and Lynx models in question, Ms. Becker
said.
   ``We have found no evidence that any systematic defect is
involved,'' she said. ``It appears the passive belt systems have
performed as designed.''
   The cars have manual lap belts in addition to the automatic
torso belts being investigated, she said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Won't Sign Clean Air Bill If It Too Costly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is calling on Congress to
approve clean air legislation but says he will veto any bill that
costs substantially more than the proposal he sent to Capitol Hill
last summer.
   ``I will only sign legislation that balances environmental and
economic progress,'' the president said Friday in a letter to Sen.
Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader.
   Bush, noting that the Senate is planning next week to begin
floor action on a tough air pollution control bill, said the
proposal is twice as expensive as the administration proposal and
the one under consideration in the House.
   The cost to industry of toughening the nation's air pollution
controls is expected to be a major subject of debate as the
legislation moves forward in Congress in the coming months.
   Senate Democrats have said in recent days that their bill is not
substantially higher in cost from the Bush proposal. But the
president in his letter to Dole said administration estimates put
its price tag at more than $40 billion a year, compared to $19
billion for the administration proposal.
   At the same time, maintained the president, the Senate bill
``provides little incremental environmental benefit'' over House
and administration versions.
   Environmentalists have maintained the Senate bill is much
stronger and should be enacted.

<HEAD>Baker Asks Greater Freedom in Distributing Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
grappling with eliminating foreign aid this year to more than a
dozen friendly nations, is seeking congressional support to
disregard some legal restrictions on how aid money is distributed.
   Baker met with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Friday to see whether
lawmakers might permit some flexibility in the so-called
``earmarks'' Congress imposed on fiscal 1990 foreign aid money.
   Dole said Baker complained that the administration has a list of
some 30 countries to which it wants to give a total of $1.6
billion, but has only $950 million in unearmarked money to hand
out, leaving a $650 million shortfall.
   State Department officials have come up with a series of
scenarios under which some of the earmarked money _ roughly $150
million to $250 million _ could be pared from its mandated
recipients and given instead to more needy countries such as
Bolivia, Jamaica, Argentina, Peru and countries in the Eastern
Caribbean.
   ``Some of these countries, small countries, important countries,
are going to be zeroed out,'' Dole told reporters. ``He asked us if
there's any chance leaders in the House and Senate might go along
with it.''
   State Department officials have been agonizing over the
allocations for this year's foreign aid for weeks. The allocations
were supposed to have been decided last month, but remain up in the
air because of the shortfall.

Convention!</HEAD>

   Only the television industry could bring a
dull convention to the city of Mardi Gras and Bourbon Street.
   The glitter business, known for choking our tubes with glitz,
gore and cheap canned thrills, decided to be sober, industrious and
subdued this year.
   In previous years, the free booze flowed like water and each of
the exhibitors from the National Association of Television
Programming Executives put on a lavish buffet.
   ``It got to be kind of a contest among the big guys to see who
could outdo the other,'' said one nostalgic executive. ``We'd
compare notes and say, `You've got to do Warner Bros., they've got
the crab claws. Paramount has the sushi.'''
   This year, there wasn't even a carrot stick in sight. And the
joint was lousy with Perrier and Diet Coke.
   ``There was food to be had,'' said one disgruntled programmer,
``but you had to sneak into the back room and gobble it like a kid.
Embarrassing.''
   So much for the New Sobriety.
   In the good old days, there was a glitz glut. Big-name show biz
acts entertained the customers. Hulk Hogan would body slam at the
drop of a contract.
   This year, the World Wrestling Federation's regulation-size ring
was usually empty, a mute reproach echoed by large, thick-necked,
mournful-looking men in business suits. The non-diaphanous robe of
the duty angel at the ``Highway to Heaven'' almost reached to her
knees.
   There wasn't even a dog and pony show.
   The 1990 rules of conduct grew out of a movement among West
Coast members, reportedly pressured by Disney chief Michael
Eisenberg and other studio heavyweights, to tone down the excesses.
   ``The only way they could get it voted through was that if one
did it, we all did it,'' said another executive, who like the
others didn't want to speak ill of his cohorts for the record.
``Next year, we'll vote on it again.''
   ``You see this banana,'' said a program buyer. ``It's the only
thing I've had to eat between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. in
three days.''
   It sure was fun, though, to watch the law of supply and demand
in action, in a year when exhibitors had roughly one-third more
programming to sell than there were time slots to air it.
   ``Are we doing more business?'' asked one executive. ``When
you're giving it away a dime on the dollar, you might be doing more
deals.''
   More than 200 exhibitors shelled out upwards of $6 a square foot
to fill the huge New Orleans Convention Center with plush, carpeted
enclosures, TV monitors, neon signs, viewing rooms with comfy
chairs and soft drink bars.
   More than 8,000 registered participants _ program directors and
station managers from your local TV stations _ percolated up and
down the aisles to take in the sights.
   They got to meet Vanna White of ``Wheel of Fortune'' and Alex
Trebeck of ``Jeopardy,'' the top-rated shows in syndication. They
shook hands with the eponymous Geraldo, Oprah and Sally Jesse
Raphael. Not to mention Joan Rivers, George Jetson, a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle and Donald Trump.
   There was the World War II-vintage torpedo plane above the ITC
booth where ``Tic Tac Dough'' is making a comeback.
   There was Paramount's bank of TVs over a ``Star Trek''-style
command desk, Buena Vista's cavernous den behind the eerie
silhouette of the Disney castle, and Warner Bros.' big logo in blue
neon.
   And, there was the remarkably tanned, fit and blond Toni Adams,
who identified herself as a TV personality for the U.S. Wrestling
Association.
   She said she runs a summer camp and a wrestling school in Texas
and manages her husband, wrestler Gentleman Chris Adams, ``So you
can see I'm more than just a pretty face.''

<TEXT>
   Mission Control ordered a 95-minute
delay Saturday in the landing of the space shuttle Columbia because
of a problem in the spaceship's computer system that was quickly
resolved.
   The ``wave-off'' call came just 25 minutes before Commander Dan
Brandenstein was to fire braking rockets to start the spaceship on
an hourlong dive through the atmosphere to end the longest shuttle
flight at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Touchdown, which had been set for 3:01 a.m. EST, was delayed
until 4:36 a.m., after Columbia made one more swing around the
globe.
   Mission Control reported a switching problem in a backup
computer, but the astronauts were able to quickly resolve the
trouble.
   In normal configuation Columbia has four primary computers
working and one backup. The control center directed the astronauts
to restructure the system to shift one of the operating units to
the backup position.
   ``Good job,'' Mike Baker, the spacecraft communicator in the
control center reported after the task was done.
   ``I don't want you guys to get the impression we don't want to
come home or anything now,'' commander Dan Brandenstein quipped,
referring to an earlier one-day postponement of the landing.
   ``We were beginning to wonder,'' Baker replied.
   Mission Control said the computer problem was believed to be a
transient signal. To be safe, technicians took the computer off
line.
   Columbia is able to operate with just two of its five computers
working.
   The spaceship and its five astronauts had planned to return home
Friday morning, but the landing was ``waved off'' first by one
orbit and then by a day because of a threat of fog that proved to
be real at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   The weather was favorable Saturday morning in the Mojave Desert.
   Columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit
until at least Monday, NASA officials said.
   The astronauts had a light day Friday, working on a couple of
experiments and snapping some more photographs of Earth before
going to bed around noon.
   They were awakened Friday evening to the strains of ``Anchors
Aweigh'' for shuttle commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim
Wetherbee, both Navy men, and the fight song for the University of
Wisconsin at River Falls, Brandenstein's alma mater.
   ``Good morning Columbia. We'd like to know what it feels like to
be record setters,'' Mission Control said.
   ``We're at a loss for words,'' Brandenstein said.
   It was the second time they were awakened. Their sleep was
interrupted in the afternoon when an alarm sounded, indicating
there was briefly too much nitrogen gas in the nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere inside the shuttle.
   The alert didn't pose a threat to the mission, and the crew went
back to bed after checking a computer system that showed there were
no further problems, NASA said.
   Dense patches of fog were in the area at the planned landing
time Friday and even lingered on through the morning, Mission
Control reported. Flight rules dictate visibility of seven miles
for landing.
   ``So it looks like it was a good call to wave off today,'' the
control center said. ``Tomorrow, Edwards is looking real good.
Should be just fine for landing ... we shouldn't have a fog problem
tomorrow.''
   ``OK, Thanks. And it looks like a great call, not a good call,''
Brandenstein replied.
   Columbia is bringing home a scientific laboratory, called the
Long Duration Exposure Facility, that the astronauts snatched from
a weakening orbit using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm. LDEF had
been in space for nearly six years, but it was being slowed by
atmospheric drag.
   The satellite was gradually sinking closer to Earth and would
have been destroyed in a fiery plunge through the atmosphere in
early March if the astronauts hadn't saved it.
   There were 57 experiments attached to LDEF's exterior, and
scientists were anxious to see how the various materials in them
fared during the long stay in space. They can use that knowledge to
design long-duration spaceships and the planned manned space
station.
   ``You've made the retrieval and return of LDEF look easy,'' Pete
Petersen, director of NASA's Langley Research Center, said in a
message sent to the crew Friday. The center at Hampton, Va., built
LDEF and manages the project.
   ``The LDEF scientists look forward to a wealth of data that will
have a major impact on future missions,'' Petersen said.
   Friday's delay not only made the flight the longest shuttle
mission yet, but it also set some records for the crew members. At
the planned landing time, Brandenstein will have logged 573 hours
in orbit _ the most ever for a shuttle astronaut.
   In addition, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar has spent more
time in space than any other female astronaut, completing 427 hours
at landing.
   Even the other three crew members, who are all first-timers in
space, set a record. Pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists
Marsha Ivins and David Low have spent more time in space, 258 hours
each, than anyone else in their 1984 astronaut class.
   The astronauts also released a Navy communications satellite and
worked on several medical and science experiments during the
mission, which is the 33rd shuttle flight and is a steppingstone
toward months-long trips aboard the space station starting in the
mid-1990s.

<HEAD>Noriega Considered Suicide During Manhunt, Says Former Spokesman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega contemplated
suicide during the time he was being stalked by U.S. troops last
month, a longtime member of the former Panamanian general's inner
circle told The Washington Post.
   Mario Rognoni, a former cabinet member, said Noriega considered
taking his own life because he didn't want to go down in history as
the war trophy of some unknown American GI, according to a report
published in today's editions.
   ``He was very conscious of history,'' said Rognoni.
   Rognoni, who served as a Noriega spokesman, gave an account of
Noriega's days in hiding before he decided to seek asylum at the
Vatican embassy in Panama City on Dec. 24. Rognoni said some of his
account was based on ``secondhand'' information from persons who
were with Noriega during the five days the general was in hiding,
but The Post reported that a number of details conformed with
accounts garnered from other sources.
   Rognoni said he maintained telephone contact with Noriega
through an intermediary during that period.
   The general felt he had three options, said Rognoni: to try to
wage guerrilla war against the Americans, to seek asylum or to
commit suicide.
   On Dec. 23, as it became increasingly difficult to evade
searching U.S. troops, Noriega decided to take his life, said
Rognoni. But the former spokesman said he believes the general was
talked out of suicide and opted to seek diplomatic asylum the next
day.
   Rognoni was arrested by U.S. forces on Christmas and spent four
days in detention. Noriega surrendered to U.S. troops on Jan. 3 and
was flown to Miami to face drug charges.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney's Background Check Reveals Domestic Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen denied the
reports of domestic violence contained in a 19-month FBI background
check, but they were confirmed by his first wife and a former
companion.
   The investigation submitted to the White House two weeks ago
also revealed that Lehtinen had problems with former employers.
   Lehtinen's temper had been mentioned as a possible liability in
the prosecution of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, and
he removed himself from the case last week amid reports the Justice
Department didn't want him to try the case, The Miami Herald
reported Friday.
   Lehtinen was appointed as acting U.S. attorney in June 1988 by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese. Justice sent the probe to
President Bush, who must submit Lehtinen's name to Congress for
confirmation.
   According to witnesses interviewed and documents obtained by the
FBI during its investigation, Lehtinen's smashed furniture and once
shoved his former wife out of the house when their marriage was
ending between 1982 and 1983.
   Lehtinen denied the allegations to the newspaper.
   ``This article and many others will make a lot of allegations,''
said his spokeswoman, Diane Cossin. ``Embroidery and speculation
are not worthy of comment.''
   Lehtinen's first wife, Donna Stevenson, said Friday that
``Dexter has a temper. I do know he throws things and he yells,''
she said. Ms. Stevenson denied Lehtinen ever hit her, however.
   During a two-year romantic relationship with his former
legislative aide, Dolores Zell, Lehtinen threw things at her, shook
her and once sprained her arm when he pushed her to the floor,
according to the FBI report.
   The FBI ``asked about some incidents where specific things
happened, like whether I had ever seen anything thrown, or have
anything thrown at me or whether I had seen any furniture broken,''
Zell said.
   She said she told the FBI ``that I had seen these things done,
and happen.''
   The FBI investigation is made up of raw data obtained from a
variety of sources and no judgement is made on the credibility of
the reports.
   The Herald also reported that Lehtinen neglected to list one of
his former employers on his official resume, and that he would not
confirm whether the omission was made on the employment history he
gave to the Justice Department.
   Lehtinen was taken off the payroll of Shutts and Bowen, a
prominent Miami law firm, in 1982 because he rarely showed up for
work even though he continued to draw paychecks, the Herald said.
   On Thursday, he confirmed that he worked for the firm and that
the firm's managers were unhappy with the amount of work he did. He
said he told the FBI ``everything I know of,'' but added that he
``didn't type those forms.''
   Lehtinen said he did not know why his confirmation has been
delayed. Justice Department officials have told him a Judiciary
Committee rules change caused the delay, he said.
   Lehtinen graduated first in his class from Stanford Law School
in 1974, became a prosecutor with the Los Angeles U.S. Attorney's
office and then with the Justice Department Organized Crime Strike
Force in Miami.
   In 1978, he left government service to pursue a political career
and worked in private law firms and as an independent attorney in
Miami.

legislation to let some 40,000 Chinese students remain in the
United States after their visas expire.
   The White House said Friday that administrative actions taken by
the executive branch of government gave the students relief that
was as good _ or better than _ the steps outlined in the vetoed
legislation.
   But congressional Democrats remained dissatisfied, and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters an attempt
will be made to override Bush's Nov. 30 veto when lawmakers return
next week.
   Mitchell also accused Bush of pursuing a wrongheaded policy
toward the Beijing government in the aftermath of the communist
regime's crushing of the student rebellion in Tiananmen Square last
June.
   He said two secret missions Bush approved to maintain contact
with Chinese leaders represented ``an embarrassing kowtowing to a
repressive government.'' Those moves sent ``exactly the wrong
signal'' to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he said.
   ``If there's one thing we can deduce from the events in the
world today, we can deduce that the days of the current Chinese
leadership are numbered,'' Mitchell said. ``We are aligning
ourselves with old men whose days are numbered. I think it's
adverse to our interests.''
   Mitchell said he expects to await a test vote in the House
before initiating action in the Senate to reverse Bush's veto of
the Chinese student relief bill.
   The White House released a letter from Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh saying that in carrying out the president's order, ``the
action I have taken affords relief equivalent to, or greater than,
the relief that would have been provided'' under the vetoed bill.
   In vetoing the bill, Bush said it was an infringement on his
authority and could jeopardize exchange programs and U.S.-China
relations.
   In his letter, Thornburgh said he complied with Bush's order,
which relied on existing law, to provide Chinese students in the
United States with irrevocable waivers of foreign residency
requirements, which they may exercise until Jan 1, 1994.
   Among other steps, he said Chinese nationals had received
necessary authorization for employment in the United States.
   Moreover, Thornburgh said, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service had established an ``outreach'' program to assist Chinese
nationals.
   ``Initial results of the program indicate that these outreach
efforts have been successful and that (Chinese) nationals are aware
of the available options and are filing applications,'' Thornburgh
said.
   In most cases, visas for visiting foreign students are issued
for two years. The bill Bush vetoed would extend the students'
visas for more four years and then give them a chance to apply for
permanent residency.

   Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts
photographed North Africa for a film documenting damage to the
planet Monday as they whirled around the world on their seventh day
in space.
   Clear skies gave the astronauts the chance to shoot pictures of
Lake Chad, the Nile Valley and fires in Kenya for a giant-screen
IMAX film called ``Planet Earth'' on the damage man and nature are
doing to Earth.
   The five crew members also worked on several medical and
scientific experiments that have been the focus of their 10-day
flight since the two main objectives _ releasing a satellite and
capturing another _ were completed last week. Columbia is scheduled
to land Friday at 2:59 a.m. PST.
   The astronauts' work day began a little early when their sleep
was interrupted Sunday by a buzzing alarm that signaled a brief
problem with a navigation system. But the five unexplained signals
from a sensor on the system that tripped an alarm posed no threat
to the mission, and the astronauts returned to bed.
   When they woke up as scheduled two hours after the alarm
sounded, Mission Control told them scientists had monitored the
suspect unit, but detected no further problems. Columbia commander
Dan Brandenstein then successfully tested the system and put in
back into operation.
   ``Everything is going well,'' flight director Al Pennington said
Monday morning. ``They've had a very good day. In fact, they're
having a very busy day today.''
   During the day, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar had difficulty
with one experiment in which she must seal the lower half of her
body inside a container resembling a collapsible vacuum bag.
   In the experiment, an astronaut drinks a saline solution and
spends time in the container, which has gently pulls the body's
fluids toward lower body parts. In space, fluids tend to move
toward the upper body. Researchers hope the two techniques will
prevent astronauts from having trouble standing when they return to
Earth.
   Dunbar had trouble with the device's waist seal, which
apparently doesn't work quite the same in weightlessness as it does
on Earth, and needed some assistance from mission specialists
Marsha Ivins and David Low.
   Mission Control awoke the astronauts with the University of
Washington fight song. Dunbar is a Washington graduate.
   ``Good morning for your second wakeup of the morning,'' the
control center said, referring to the earlier alarm.
   Ground controllers also apologized to the crew for having to
work on a holiday.
   ``Sorry you have to work through the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday, but you're doing so well that no one wants to give you a
break,'' Mission Control said in morning messages sent to the crew
via the shuttle's fax machine.
   Columbia pilot Jim Wetherbee received a special message: a
certificate from Sunday's Houston Tenneco Marathon. Wetherbee ran
on a treadmill at about the same time his mother, Althea,
participated in the 26.2-mile marathon. Mrs. Wetherbee had asked
him to be her pace partner in space.
   Wetherbee's certificate said he ``ran'' the marathon in 5.4
seconds, meaning that was how quickly he traveled 26.2 miles in
space. His 70-year-old mother, the oldest female to participate,
finished in four hours, 59 minutes and seven seconds.
   ``You were awarded an honorary completion certificate for the
marathon. Many of us were surprised you weren't disqualified for
leaving the course,'' Mission Control's message said.

   Storms with high winds that spawned at least three
tornadoes moved out of Texas today, leaving in their wake a trail
of battered homes and more than a foot of snow that snarled traffic
in the Panhandle.
   At least two people were injured in one of the twisters,
authorities said. Both were listed in stable condition at a
hospital in Lufkin, southeast Texas.
   One tornado flipped over a mobile home and knocked out power
lines Friday in nearby Hudson.
   Heavy snow in northwest Texas that began Thursday night caused
at least one traffic death. Benjamin Thorpe, 60, of Big Spring died
when his tractor-trailer rig slipped off a bridge near Lubbock.
   Snow drifts of 3 to 4 feet were common in the Panhandle, and the
state highway department ``strongly discouraged'' travel in the
area Friday, closing two state highways. One was later reopened as
skies cleared.
   In three Dallas suburbs, high winds tore a roof off a restaurant
and damaged buildings and houses.
   ``Our roof's over in our neighbor's yard here,'' a cashier at a
Webb's barbecue restaurant in Duncanville told Dallas radio station
KRLD. ``I just saw things flying.'' The cashier was not identified.
   A Garland police officer reported sighting a funnel cloud, but
much of the damage was blamed on storm winds. Damage in Grand
Prairie occurred along a path stretching several miles, authorities
said.
   An undetermined number of houses were damaged by the twister
that struck Hudson. About 200 area homes went without power for
several hours, authorities said.
   ``It's quieted down. But a lot of power lines are still down,''
said Lupe Laird, a dispatcher for the Angelina County Sheriff's
Department, late Friday. The twister downed electrical lines at a
subdivision housing 1,800 people near Hudson, and it may be two
days before power is restored, she said.
   The National Weather Service posted flash flood watches and
river flood warnings as the system moved eastward.

   China published new regulations today banning
foreign journalists from actions the government deems harmful to
society and from filing reports it views as false.
   The broadly worded regulations give the government wide latitude
for controlling foreign journalists following the Jan. 11 lifting
of martial law in Beijing. The martial regulations had placed tight
restrictions on reporters.
   ``Foreign journalists and resident foreign news organizations
should observe professional news ethics and not distort the facts,
create rumors or use improper methods to interview or report,''
said the regulations, which were signed by Premier Li Peng on
Friday and took effect immediately.
   ``Foreign journalists ... cannot carry out activities that are
incompatible with their status or that endanger Chinese national
security, unity or society's common interests,'' the rules said.
   The Information Department may give warnings or revoke the
accreditation of journalists who violate the regulations, one
clause said.
   China criticized as distorted most foreign reporting on the
pro-democracy protests last spring and the June 3-4 army attack
that crushed them, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of
people.
   The government maintains the protests were a foreign-instigated
plot to overthrow the Communist system.
   During the protests, Chinese consulates abroad stopped issuing
work visas for visiting journalists, and dozens entered with
tourist visas.
   In June, the government expelled two American reporters based in
Beijing, an Associated Press reporter and one from the U.S.
government-funded Voice of America radio.
   The new regulations do not explain what are considered improper
methods of gathering information. Under martial law, all interviews
had to be approved by military authorities.
   The regulations make no mention of informal or on-the-street
interviews, which were permitted before martial law was imposed May
20. Even since martial law was lifted, however, few Chinese have
dared to give on-the-street interviews. Even officials often regard
interviews as political risks.
   It was not clear if the new regulations supercede a 1986 set of
rules that required foreign journalists to get approval 10 days in
advance before leaving Beijing to report elsewhere in China. That
rule has been used mainly to keep journalists from visiting Tibet,
where Buddhist monks and nuns have repeatedly demonstrated for
independence.

   Two earthquakes shook the Iranian city of
Tehran and nearby areas early today, injuring two people and
damaging homes, Iran's official media said.
   The quakes at 4:57 a.m. and 5:45 a.m. registered 5.2 and 4.9 on
the Richter scale, according to the the official Islamic Republic
News Agency.
   They were centered 85 miles east of Tehran, the capital.
   The agency said the injuries occurred in Firuzkuh, 70 miles east
of Tehran. The homes were damaged in the capital, it said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

   Deputy Chief Elizabeth Watson promised to
continue the community work of her black predecessor as she becomes
the leader of the nation's largest police department ever directed
by a woman.
   Mrs. Watson, 40, succeeds Lee Brown, who takes over as New York
City's police commissioner Monday. Brown was Houston's first black
police chief when he was tabbed in 1982 by Mayor Kathy Whitmire,
who on Friday named Mrs. Watson.
   Mrs. Watson, a 17-year veteran of the force, said she favored
efforts by Brown to get officers more involved at the community
level, especially with minorities, an approach the mayor had said
was a criterion in her search for a new police chief.
   Mrs. Watson had commanded several divisions, worked five years
as a detective and was assigned to an anti-riot and terrorism squad
at one time.
   ``I am not Lee Brown in pretty obvious ways,'' Mrs. Watson said,
laughing. ``But I do share his commitment and his vision to see
policing in America become a partnership with the community.''
   Mrs. Watson will lead a force of some 4,500 officers whose
morale is thought to be low. Houston's slow economy in recent years
has prevented officers from receiving pay raises.
   The department also has been held up for criticism in the wake
of two recent fatal shootings of citizens.
   In one, a woman was shot to death in October after a freeway
altercation with three off-duty officers. In November, a security
guard was shot after being pulled over for a traffic violation.
   Brown, in one of his last acts as chief this week, fired the
four officers involved in those incidents.
   The mayor's nomination must be approved by the city council,
where initial reaction was positive.
   ``I think this lady has done a great job,'' Councilman Frank
Mancuso said. ``She didn't get to be a deputy chief by accident.''
   She also received backing from Mark Clark, president of the
Houston Police Officers Association.
   Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the Washington-based
National Association of Chiefs of Police, said of her selection was
remarkable, considering 92 percent of police officers are men.
   ``It's always been a man's world,'' he said. ``To have a woman
rise so rapidly and then be named head of one of the largest police
forces, that's an extraordinary circumstance,'' he said.
   The only large city to have female chief previously was
Portland, Ore., which had a woman heading the force for 1{ years a
few years ago, Arenberg said.
   A native of Philadelphia, Mrs. Watson moved in 1963 to Houston
and attended public schools. She was an honors graduate of Texas
Tech University in Lubbock.
   Mrs. Watson and her husband, Robert, a police sergeant, have two
children.

   An FBI agent and a man suspected in a bank

   The SWAT team knocked on the door at the house of James Price,
45, Friday evening, to serve a warrant. When he didn't answer, they
broke down the door with a battering ram, FBI spokesman David
Binney said.
   As they entered the house Price opened fire with a shotgun,
Binney said.
   The FBI agent pronounced dead at a hospital two hours after the
shooting was the first slain in the line of duty in St. Louis,
authorities said.
   The injured agents were treated and released for gunshot wounds
to the arm and leg, respectively, Binney said. Their names weren't
provided.
   No one else was in the house when the shooting occurred.
   Authorities were looking for the weapons and money taken in a
Jan. 3 robbery, Binney said.

<TEXT>
   Families of victims of the 1986 hijacking of a
Pan American World Airways plane in Pakistan can sue the airline
for punitive damages, a federal judge ruled.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo was at odds
with an earlier federal ruling and is the latest interpretation of
the Warsaw Convention on international air travel.
   On Jan. 3, a federal judge in Brooklyn, Thomas Platt, ruled that
the treaty barred punitive damages for families of passengers
killed in the December 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Platt said the Warsaw Convention restricted international
aviation lawsuits to compensatory damages and limited those damages
to $75,000, unless ``willful misconduct'' was proven.
   Sprizzo, however, disagreed. In his decision Thursday, he said
no language in the treaty ``expressly preempts or precludes''
punitive claims.
   Sprizzo's ruling stemmed from more than 50 lawsuits filed by the
families of victims of the hijacking of a Pan Am flight from
Bombay, India, to New York on Sept. 5, 1986.
   At a scheduled stop in Karachi, Pakistan, four gunmen seized the
plane. Twenty passengers were killed and dozens more were injured.
   A call to Pan Am for comment was not returned.
   Lee A. Kriendler, an attorney representing plaintiffs in both
the Lockerbie and Pakistan lawsuits, said he has asked Platt for a
rehearing on his ruling in the Lockerbie case. He also sent Platt a
copy of Sprizzo's ruling.
   In a previous ruling, a federal judge in Washington allowed
plaintiffs in the 1983 Korean Airlines disaster to seek punitive
damages from the airline.
   That case involved the Soviet shooting down of a KAL plane
carrying 269 people. A jury awarded $50 million to about 130
families. The award is now under appeal.

   Peggy McMartin Buckey, acquitted in a
preschool molestation trial that lasted nearly three years, plans a
return to court for a $1 million lawsuit that alleges malicious
prosecution.
   ``I feel I have a right to have a home again,'' Mrs. Buckey said
Friday. ``My husband and I worked hard for what we had. And to take
everything away from someone who's done nothing _ it's a
nightmare.''
   Buckey said the family has been living off her husband's
earnings as an aircraft company electrical technician, her and her
mother's Social Security, their daughter's teaching salary, and
help from their church.
   At a packed news conference, Buckey and members of her family
told of death threats issued in the aftermath of the verdict, and
said they are considering moving out of Southern California.
   ``My husband was threatened in court yesterday,'' Buckey told
reporters. ``They told him, `You're gonna be killed.'''
   The 63-year-old Mrs. Buckey, and her son, Raymond, 31, won
acquittal of 52 felony charges on Thursday because jurors said
bizarre allegations of molestation at the McMartin Pre-School
appeared to be the result of coaching by parents and therapists.
   A mistrial was declared on 13 other counts, all involving
Raymond Buckey. The district attorney's office will have to decide
whether to try those counts again.
   The nation's longest criminal trial cost over $15 million.
   The suit filed Friday names as defendants Los Angeles County,
the city of Manhattan Beach, former District Attorney Robert
Philibosian, Children's Institute International and therapist Kee
MacFarlane, as well as Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and its former
reporter Wayne Satz.
   ``I have no idea what her intent might be,'' Philibosian said.
``Similar lawsuits have been filed in the past and they are all
routinely dismissed by the courts. It's not unusual for defendants
to do this,'' he said.
   Ms. MacFarlane said the lawsuit was the fifth filed against her
by various former McMartin defendants, ``and every court that has
been asked to consider them, including the California Supreme
Court, has thrown them out,'' she said.
   ``My opinion, both as a lawyer and a reporter, is that this is
an entirely frivolous and groundless kind of lawsuit,'' said Satz,
who often broke stories in the case in early 1984.
   ``We stand by our coverage, but we have not yet seen the legal
papers,'' was the response of a Capital Cities-ABC spokeswoman in
New York.
   Assistant Los Angeles County Counsel Robert Ambrose refused
immediate comment on the suit, and Manhattan Beach City Attorney
Carl Newton was not in his office.
   The lawsuit contended that all defendants joined in a conspiracy
to have the McMartin defendants indicted. They were accused of
defamation, malicious prosecution, conspiracy and violation of Mrs.
Buckey's civil rights. The suit sought general damages of $1
million and unspecified punitive damages.
   Mrs. Buckey, who is the only plaintiff in the federal suit,
appeared at the news conference with her mother, Virginia McMartin
and her daughter, Peggy Ann Buckey, who both were charged in the
original child molestation case but had their cases dismissed.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Soldiers Charged in Priests' Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case closely watched by
the U.S. Congress and human rights activists, the director of El
Salvador's Military College and eight other soldiers were charged
with murdering six Jesuit priests.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Penal Court on Friday ordered
Col. Guillermo Benavides, three lieutenants and four enlisted men
to stand trial. The murder charges imply ``premeditation and
perfidy'' and carry a maximum sentence of 30 years, court secretary
Nicolas Hernandez said.
   A fifth enlisted was charged, but he deserted in December and is
a fugitive.
   The new rector of the Jose Simeon Canas Central American
University, where the priests taught and were slain, called the
investigation ``insufficient.''
   ``We believe the investigation as to who was behind this is
lacking a series of elements,'' said the Rev. Francisco Estrada.
``It seems to us strange that a sole colonel would have decided to
commit a crime of this magnitude.''
   All six priests were educators at the university, one of the
region's leading institutions. The priests, their housekeeper and
her teenage daughter were dragged out of their beds on the night of
Nov. 16 and fatally shot by uniformed men.
   Benavides, chief of the Military College and a former head of
military intelligence, is the highest Salvadoran officer ever
charged with a human rights-related crime.
   No officer has been convicted of such a crime, even though
rightist death squads killed thousands of suspected leftists in the
early 1980s.
   All the defendants except Benavides and Lt. Rene Mendoza, who
was also at the Military College, are members of the elite
U.S.-trained Atlacatl infantry battalion.
   The unit had been assigned to Benavides to provide security for
the rear section of the college. The campus is on the south side of
the Military College.
   ``I don't want any witnesses,'' two accused lieutenants _
Gonzalo Guevara and Jose Espinoza _ quoted Benavides as telling
them shortly before midnight Nov. 15, when he allegedly ordered the
killings.
   ``OK, gentlemen. We're playing for keeps. It's either them or
us, because they have been the intellectuals directing the
guerrillas for a long time,'' Guevara's testimony quoted Benavides
as saying.
   The massacre took place during a major offensive by leftist
guerrillas in the country's decade-old civil war. Rightists often
accuse clergymen of helping the leftists, and the killings of the
Jesuits raised fears of a return to the days of wholesale slaughter
by death squads.
   The killings also prompted calls in Washington for a
re-evaluation of the $1.5 million in military and economic aid the
United States provides El Salvador daily.
   Zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72-hour deadline that
began Tuesday when the prisoners, who have been under arrest since
early January, were put at the disposition of the court.
   The court order opens a 120-day period during which the case is
prepared for trial, but this phase can be delayed by motions.
   In the pre-trial depositions made public Friday, several of the
soldiers described how five of the priests, including then rector
Ignacio Ellacuria and vice-rector Ignacio Martin-Baro, were roused
from bed, taken to the yard behind their home, and forced to lie
face down in the grass.
   Two of the men charged, Sgt. Antonio Avalos and Pvt. Oscar
Amaya, admitted they fatally shot them. Avalos said he understood
Espinoza gave the order to fire, and that if he disobeyed he
``would be accused of treason.''
   Espinoza, Guevara and Mendoza denied they were involved in the
killing but admitted they took part in the operation. Benavides'
deposition was not made available, but court sources said he denies
the murder charge.
   Cpl. Angel Perez admitted fatally shooting the Rev. Joaquin
Lopez y Lopez, the sixth Jesuit, inside the house. Sgt. Tomas
Zarate admitted shooting the housekeeper, Elba Ramos, and her
15-year-old daughter, Celina.
   Avalos testified that as he was going out of the building, he
``heard people groaning from within a dark room, and thought they
must be people who had been shot but not dead.'' He said he and
fugitive defendant Pvt. Jorge Sierra went to the door.
   Avalos says he ``lighted a match and saw two women on the floor,
hugging each other and whimpering,'' so he ordered Sierra to finish
them off, and Sierra fired a burst of about 10 rounds from his M-16
automatic rifle ``until they stopped whimpering.''
   Several defendants described how the murder squad staged a mock

   A judge sentenced former U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia
to three years in prison but said he would be eligible for parole
after six months since his crimes were less serious than others
convicted in the Wedtech scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand said he felt the sentence was
the most lenient he could give Garcia, convicted with his wife of
extorting payoffs from Wedtech Corp., the now-defunct defense
contractor.
   His wife, Jane Lee Garcia, received the same sentence and parole
order as Garcia.
   Garcia, a 58-year-old Democrat, resigned his congressional seat
earlier this month. He had represented the economically-blighted
South Bronx, where Wedtech was located, for 12 years.
   Former New York Knicks basketball star Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe
has agreed to run for the seat in a March special election,
according to a report in the Daily News today. Monroe, a
Republican, runs a music production company.
   Sand conceded that Garcia's crimes were less than others
convicted in the Wedtech scandal, but said he felt Garcia had to
spend some time in prison as a deterrent and as an example.
   ``You yielded to the temptation of betraying your office so you
and your wife might enjoy a higher lifestyle,'' the judge said.
   Sand imposed no fines on the Garcias after their attorneys said
they were completely destitute and recently had lost even their
apartment. Garcia asked for leniency for himself and mercy for his
wife.
   He apologized to his former constituents, but said he would
pursue and appeal.
   ``For years, I worked long and hard for the people I've
represented,'' Garcia said. ``I never tried deliberately to harm
them.''
   Mrs. Garcia, 49, told the judge that the hardest part of the
ordeal for her and her husband has been consoling those close to
them.
   ``The past three years have been more difficult than anything
you can imagine,'' she said.
   The Garcias were the last major defendants tried in the
wide-ranging corruption scandal at Wedtech.
   Evidence at the trials showed that Wedtech, once a small machine
shop, grew into a multimillion-dollar defense contractor through
various bribe schemes. The company collapsed in 1986 amid
allegations of corruption.
   A jury, in a verdict returned Oct. 20, found that the Garcias
extorted $76,000 from the Wedtech Corp. from 1984 to 1986 in return
for help in obtaining government contracts. Wedtech channeled them
a $20,000 interest-free loan through Garcia's sister.
   In 1988, former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi was convicted of
racketeering charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Others convicted in the scandal were former Bronx Borough
President Stanley Simon, who received an eight-year term, and E.
Robert Wallach, a close friend of ex-U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese, who was sentenced to six years.

<HEAD>Reporter Who Covered Russian Revolution Dead At 96</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank H. King, whose news career of more
than 50 years included a 7,000-mile odyssey across Siberia while
covering the Russian Revolution for The Associated Press, has died
at age 96.
   King died in his sleep shortly before dawn Friday in Oakland.
   For decades, King was regarded by associates as the best that a
reporter could be, a man who once risked his life to rescue women
and children trapped in a Vladivostok railway station. For this he
won a U.S. Army commendation.
   King's field of action spanned much of the world during his long
career. He was the first American reporter to describe, in
eyewitness accounts, what life was like in revolutionary Russia.
   King's exclusive series won wide play in America and Europe.
Later, after a brief assignment with Washington AP bureau, King
joined the London bureau, where he was named bureau chief during
his 17-year tour. He then went to Dallas as bureau chief, retiring
in Dec. 31, 1958 as Southwest AP general executive after a 38-year
AP career.
   ``Frank King lived journalism, and I know of no one who came
closer to being the essence of what it's all about,'' said Felix
McKnight, former chief executive of the Dallas Times Herald and a
newsman in the Dallas AP bureau when King arrived.
   McKnight said that King ``loved his Texas assignment and became,
I guess, the most respected and best-loved newspaper man in this
part of the country during his stay as bureau chief.''
   Born Dec. 31, 1893, at Excelsior Springs, Mo., King was a
graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He
became an AP stringer in Columbia, Mo., reporting to the St. Louis
bureau on everything from sports to politics.
   He joined the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but his $17.50 weekly pay
was not enough to hold him when he got a chance to join the
English-language Japan Advertiser in Tokyo in 1917.
   With Russia in revolution, the United States, Britain, France
and Japan sent expeditionary forces to Vladivostok in 1918. The AP
and the Japan Advertiser together hired King to cover the action.
   At one point, he quit taking notes long enough to dodge bullets
and help to rescue women and children besieged in the Vladivostok
railway station during an attack by revolutionaries.
   U.S. Army Maj. Samuel I. Johnson, the assistant commander of the
local Allied garrison, wrote to the AP in New York:
   ``I consider it my urgent duty to inform you of the excellent
conduct of Mr. Frank H. King, correspondent for The Associated
Press. His splendid conduct and coolness convinced me that he is a
true type of American correspondent.''
   Finally, Admiral Alexander Kolchak, the White Russian leader,
was seized and executed by the Bolsheviks and resistance collapsed.
In the spring of 1920, the Allies pulled out. King was on his own.
   King decided to return to Tokyo by an indirect route. He went
down the coast to China and Peking, then headed west.
   He put a small kit together and traveled across Mongolia,
Siberia and Russia. He traveled anyway he could. He walked and rode
in a pony cart, a river steamer and on the Trans-Siberian Railway.
   He went through the Great Wall and across the Gobi desert,
filing stories from such exotic places as Irkutsk and Urga. He
didn't know if the copy was received.
   Moscow authorities finally ordered King interned in an old
Czarist mansion while they debated what to do with him.
   King was rescued by John Reed, the American radical, author of
``Ten Days That Shook the World,'' who was the darling of the
Leninists. The authorities decided the best solution was to shove
King across the border into Finland. From there, he made his way
through Scandinavia to London.
   He leaves his wife of 65 years, Olga, and one son, Frank H.H.
King, a college professor in New Mexico. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

<HEAD>Barco: Colombia Will Continue Fighting Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco told his
countrymen that despite an apparent concession of defeat by drug
traffickers, the government will continue to fight them to ensure
its ``final success.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration, which backs Colombia in
its fight against the drug lords, said its position also remained
unchanged.
   In a communique Friday, Barco said, ``The country has not
allowed itself to be carried away by hasty expectations. It should
maintain that attitude.''
   He said it was necessary ``to take the best road to ensure the
final success of the policy followed by the government, supported
by the Colombian people and the international community.''
   Officials have mounted a major effort to stamp out the
traffickers since August, when cocaine lords were blamed for the
killing of a leading presidential candidate. Earlier this week,
traffickers from the Medellin cartel released three hostages and
issued a message admitting defeat and asking for amnesty.
   In its message Wednesday, the group used the name
``Extraditables,'' referring to the government's policy of
extraditing drug suspects wanted in the United States. Several
Colombian officials have said it was merely a ploy to lure Barco
into ending extraditions.
   Since August, Colombia has extradited 13 drug suspects to the
United States.
   Other officials expressed concern that Medellin cartel leaders
are trying to persuade the government to include them in an amnesty
recently offered to leftist guerrillas for past political crimes.
   Barco's communique appeared to rule out both an end to
extradition and an extension of the amnesty to drug traffickers.
   ``The national government and authorities, at all levels, will
continue completing their duty of enforcing the law and bringing
criminals to justice using constitutional and legal procedures and
the alternatives offered by the current judicial order,'' it said.
   Barco reiterated the government's demand that drug traffickers
keep their promises to end assassinations and other terrorist
violence, to free all hostages, and to abandon their billion-dollar
cocaine business.
   The traffickers responded to the government's crackdown with
bombings and assassinations that killed 209 people and injured
1,243.
   ``Our position is still the same,'' White House secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said Friday in Washington. ``We have traditionally been
opposed to deals with the cartel ... Essentially it's a matter for
Colombia to deal with.''
   The cartel currently holds at least 18 hostages, including
Alvaro Diego Montoya, the son of Barco's general secretary and
closest adviser, German Montoya.

injuring four students and the teacher.
   The blast Friday afternoon at St. Francis Catholic High School
occurred when the freshmen mixed water in a beaker with sodium, an
explosive combination, said Los Angeles County Fire Department

   ``A glass beaker shattered. It sent glass flying around the desk

principal at the Catholic boys school.
   Teacher Mike Mudie and three of the students were treated and
released from Verdugo Hills Hospital with facial irritation and
cuts.
   A 15-year-old who suffered a badly cut eyelid was being treated
by an opthalmolgist, said spokeswoman Jackie Forsythe at Verdugo
Hills Hospital in Glandale.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Murder Convictions in Job-Related Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court overturned the convictions of
three former executives believed the first ever to be found guilty
of murder for the work-related death of an employee.
   The Illinois appellate court ruled Friday that the three top
officials of the now-defunct Elk Grove Village-based Film Recovery
Systems Inc. had been wrongly convicted of murder and other charges
in the 1983 cyanide poisoning death of Stefan Golab.
   Cook County State's Attorney Cecil Partee said he would appeal
the ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court.
   ``We are taking this case to the Supreme Court because we
believe workplace safety to be an extremely important issue,''
Partee said. ``The evidence showed that the defendants went out of
their way to hide the dangers from their employees and knowingly
failed to protect them from obvious harm.''
   Golab, 61, a Polish immigrant, worked at the plant where cyanide
was used to recover silver from used X-ray film. He collapsed at
work after complaining of dizziness and nausea.
   Prosecutors likened the plant to a ``huge gas chamber.''
   The defunct company's former president, Steven J. O'Neil, plant
manager Charles Kirschbaum and foreman Daniel Rodriguez were
convicted of murder, involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct
in a bench trial before Circuit Judge Ronald J.P. Banks. They were
sentenced to 25 years in prison but were free pending an appellate
ruling.
   Their appeal argued the convictions were inconsistent because a
murder conviction requires a different mental state than does a
conviction for involuntary manslaughter or reckless conduct, said
Elliot Samuels, who represented Kirschbaum and Rodriguez in the
appeal.
   Murder requires deliberate intent while a verdict of reckless
conduct requires a state of mind ``somewhere between negligence and
indifference,'' Samuels said.
   The appellate court agreed, saying the convictions were
``legally inconsistent.''
   Partee said he believes the appellate court ``made the wrong
ruling.''
   ``The appellate court found that the evidence at the trial was
indeed sufficient to sustain the convictions beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' Partee said in a statement.
   ``This issue is much too important to surrender on the basis of
a hypertechnical reading of the law.''
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, who prosecuted the case while he was
state's attorney, supported an appeal.
   ``The earlier decision was precedent-setting nationally in terms
of the protection that it gave to working men and women,'' said
Daley's spokeswoman, Avis LaVelle.
   Witnesses testified at the Circuit Court trial that Film
Recovery workers were not told they were working with cyanide or
that compounds used at the plant could be harmful.
   Prosecutors also said the plant was manned largely by illegal
Polish and Hispanic immigrants, most of whom spoke or read very
little English.
   The defense said the three officials were responsible managers,
had no idea conditions were dangerous and worked at the plant
themselves.

   Cloudy skies spewed snow, sleet and rain from the central
Midwest to southern New England today, while a snowstorm lingered
in Colorado.
   High winds that spawned at least three tornadoes moved out of
Texas today, leaving battered homes and more than a foot of snow.
Nine inches of rain soaked the area west of Gilmer, Texas, since
Wednesday.
   Snowdrifts of 3 to 4 feet were common in the Texas Panhandle.
   The National Weather Service posted flash flood watches and
river flood warnings as the storm system moved eastward.
   The Southeast looked to continue its mild weather through the
weekend. Florida was due for isolated thundershowers.
   Total Colorado snow accumulations, which reached 14 inches by
late Friday, were expected to be in the 10- to 20-inch range before
the storm left the state for Kansas today.
   Several cities in Kansas reported about a foot of snow with
unofficial reports of up to 20 inches in some parts of the state,
the Weather Service said.
   Winter storm warnings and warnings of heavy snow were posted for
central Kansas, southwestern Nebraska, northeastern Colorado and
for much of Iowa.
   Winter storm watches were in effect for northwestern Illinois,
southern Lower Michigan and parts of New York state, including the
Susquehanna and Catskill areas and lower Hudson Valley.
   Winter storm watches for today and tonight were called in
southern Wisconsin and in Pennsylvania's middle and upper
Susquehanna Valley and the Pocono Mountains.
   Clear, calm conditions were expected in the West.
   Record high temperatures set for Jan. 19 included 86 in Ft.
Myers, Fla., and 79 in Macon, Ga.
   In Florida, Tampa's 85 degrees tied a 53-year-old record high
reading for January.
   Friday's high temperature for the nation was 89 at McAllen,
Texas.

   The jet, owned by Aero Flight Services Inc., of Ypsilanti,

<TEXT>
   Iranian media reported today that the TV
station in a Moslem city in Soviet Azerbaijan had broadcast a
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.
   The report came as Soviet troops moved into the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku, killing at least 60 people in a crackdown on
ethnic unrest, Soviet news reports said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the TV announcement as
saying Soviet troops should leave Nakhichevan, on the Iranian
border 1,200 miles south of Moscow.
   Nakhichevan is part of Azerbaijan but separated from the rest of
the republic by a strip of Armenian territory. The enclave's
capital city also is called Nakhichevan.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said its correspondents on the
Iranian side reported seeing a power blackout during the night on
the Soviet side.
   The television in Nakhichevan broadcast its resolution three
times following martial music, IRNA said. The resolution called for
independence from Moscow, a pullout of Soviet troops and an end to
alleged Soviet aggressions in Nakhichevan.
   It also called on Turkey, Iran, the United Nations and world
governments to help safeguard Nakhichevan's territorial integrity
and prevent a massacre, the agency said.
   The television said its resolution was taken because of the
``terror'' caused by alleged attacks by Armenians.
   Violence first broke out in the 2,200-square-mile enclave in
November 1988, when Armenian media said gangs of Azerbaijanis
ransacked Armenian homes in Nakhichevan. It broke out again a week
ago with the current unrest all over Azerbaijan.
   Meanwhile, official Tehran radio said thousands of Azerbaijanis
streamed into Iran this morning across a border bridge in Astara, a
resort town on the Black Sea.
   The radio, also monitored in Cyprus, said most Soviet
Azerbaijanis who travel to Iran return to the Soviet Union the same
day, after visiting relatives or purchasing goods.
   IRNA said thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis crossed the border
Friday and staged a demonstration in support of spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, chanting ``God is Great'' and ``Khamenei is
the leader.''
   They also participated in the traditional Moslem Friday prayer
service, the agency said.
   Iranian television, monitored in Cyprus, broadcast scenes of
Azerbaijanis waving identical copies of the Koran apparently
donated by the Iranians, as well as pictures of the snow-covered
border region with Soviet armored vehicles patrolling the border.
   Soviet news media have accused returning Azerbaijanis of
smuggling in weapons provided by Iran.
   Khamenei said earlier in the week that the upheaval in
Azerbaijan was caused by Islamic zeal.

<HEAD>China Reports Prisoner Swap With Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China and Vietnam exchanged a total of 22
prisoners of war at Friendship Pass on the two countries' heavily
guarded border, the official Chinese news agency said.
   The exchange Friday indicated slightly warmer relations after
more than a decade of hostility between the two countries. It came
a day after the 40th anniversary of China's giving diplomatic
recogniation to Vietnam's Communist guerrillas.
   The prisoner trade took place with an International Red Cross
representative watching, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   China released 17 Vietnamese soldiers who ``illegally entered
Chinese territory to carry out armed provocation and sabotage,'' it
said.
   ``During interrogations, the Vietnamese captives pleaded guilty
to invading Chinese territory and carrying out illegal
activities,'' Xinhua said. It said China released them ``in the
spirit of humanitarianism.''
   It said Vietnam handed over five captured Chinese soldiers but
did provide details.
   China's Communist Party aided Vietnamese Communists as early as
the 1930s and recognized Ho Chi Minh's jungle insurgency as
Vietnam's government on Jan. 18, 1950. China supplied the
Vietnamese Communists with weapons in their battle against U.S.
troops to reunify Vietnam.
   Relations soured, however, after Vietnam invaded neighboring
Cambodia in 1978 and ousted the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge.
China attacked Vietnam in 1979, and border clashes have occurred
since, although with decreasing frequency.
   Vietnam's official Radio Hanoi said Wednesday that Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had sent a message commemorating the
anniversary of relations and pledging to ``strive untiringly to
restore the relations of friendship ... at an early date.''
   Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in October that China
was willing to normalize relations with Vietnam if it would end its
occupation of Cambodia. China disputes Vietnam's claim to have
pulled its last troops out in September.
   The two countries also have clashed over several island chains
in the South China Sea, the Spratlys and the Paracels.

   Slumbering residents startled awake by two
massive sonic booms triggered by the landing space shuttle Columbia
telephoned authorities with jittery reports ranging from
earthquakes to burglars.
   The shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base without a hitch at
1:35 a.m. PST today after passing over the coast near here, jolting
people awake with a pair of sonic booms that rattled windows.
   ``We got quite a few calls,'' said Los Angeles County sheriff's
Deputy Sheila Smith. ``Some thought it was an earthquake, others
said someone was trying to break in or was on the roof.
   ``One guy said he thought a car crashed into the house next
door,'' she said, adding that the Malibu station received about two
dozen calls.
   All the sleepy callers were asked if what they heard might have
been a sonic boom. After being told about the shuttle landing, they
agreed it was the likely source, Ms. Smith said.
   The 11-day shuttle mission was the longest ever for a space
shuttle and Columbia, carrying a rescued satellite in its cargo
bay, returned to Earth heavier than any previous shuttle.

   Followers of the late Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh, the free-love guru who was expelled by the United States,
today danced, meditated and chanted the mystic's favorite mantra _
``hoo, hoo, hoo'' _ a day after his death of a heart attack.
   Rajneesh also made a final ``appearance'' before 10,000 of his
followers in a videotape and told them: ``Think deep. Go deeper.''
   The 58-year-old mystic has not named a successor, and his death
Friday launched a wave of speculation about the future of his
commune, its 500 worldwide branches, and its claimed 500,000
members.
   The videotape was played at the mystic's southern commune in the
city of Poona, where Rajneesh set up an international headquarters
after his deportation from the United States in 1985.
   ``Osho is very much here,'' said follower Ma Yoga, using an
honorific name that Rajneesh called himself in recent years. The
term means ``on whom the heavens shower flowers.'' ``Bhagwan'' is a
Hindu honorific meaning ``god.''
   ``It is like any other day here. It does not matter if Osho has
left his body,'' said Ma Yoga, a member of the 23-year-old cult's
Poona commune, in a telephone interview. ``He lives, the commune
lives.''
   A statement from the commune quoted the guru as saying hours
before his death, ``My work will go on and grow stronger after I
leave my body.''
   In a statement telexed from Poona, Rajneesh's personal doctor
said the guru was in pain for many weeks before his death.
   ``I asked Osho if he wanted us to prepare for cardiac
resuscitation, and he said, `No, if I die it will be relief from
the pain,''' said British physician Swami Amrito.
   Rajneesh died of a heart attack, according to a doctor's death
certificate.
   However, a commune statement released today said the guru died
because ``living in the body had become a hell.''
   It repeated Rajneesh's charges he was poisoned in U.S. jails
before he was deported.``While he was in Oklahoma County jail (in
Oklahoma state), he was poisoned with heavy metal thallium. They
exposed him to radiation in a way that it will not leave any
proof.''
   Thallium is used in making rat poison.
   Local health officials said Rajneesh suffered from AIDS, but the
commune denied those reports about two years ago.
   Rajneesh's most famous commune, the Rancho Rajneesh, was founded
in Oregon in 1981.
   He brought his teachings of free sex and materialism to the
scrubby hills near Antelope, Ore., drawing thousands of slavish
disciples. They were rewarded with the guru's daily ``drive-by'' in
one of his 93 Rolls-Royces _ many painted psychedelic colors, and
some decorated with peacocks and lacy curtains.
   To many nearby residents, the commune known as Rajneeshpuram was
a monstrous intrusion. It was disbanded in 1985 when Rajneesh, a
native of India, was expelled from the United States in a plea
bargain on immigration fraud charges.

<TEXT>
   The West German airline Lufthansa and the
East German state carrier Interflug are planning to build an
international airport to serve both East and West Berlin.
   The joint plan, announced by airline officials Friday, calls for
the airport south of Berlin to be completed by the year 2005. It
would be capable of handling 30 million passengers a year.
   The project was announced by Lufthansa chairman Heinz Ruhnau and
Interflug chief Klaus Henkes at a joint news conference at East
Berlin's Schoenefeld airport.
   Henkes also said he expected Interflug to double its number of
passengers to 6 million this year as a result of East Germany's
decision in November to open its Western borders.
   Blueprints for the new airport are expected to be completed by
1995, the two airline chairmen said. The airport will served by a
subway.
   Currently, West Berlin's Tegel airport is served only by U.S.,
French and British airlines. Regulations of the Allied powers
controlling West Berlin ban Lufthansa from flying there.
   The two airlines also agreed to launch a joint charter company.

   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s decision to
cancel a planned test marketing of a cigarette aimed at blacks is a
``victory for health,'' the nation's top health official said.
   Reynolds' announcement on Friday came a day after Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan attacked the company for
promoting a ``culture of cancer.''
   The company said anti-smoking advocates misrepresented Reynolds'
plans for a campaign that was to begin in Philadelphia in three
weeks for a new menthol cigarette called Uptown.
   ``We regret that a small coalition of anti-smoking zealots
apparently believes that black smokers are somehow different from
others who choose to smoke and must not be allowed to exercise the
same freedom of choice available to all other smokers,'' said Peter
Hoult, Reynolds executive vice president of marketing.
   Sullivan said he was elated by the company's decision.
   ``This is a victory for the citizens of Philadelphia, for
minority citizens and indeed for all Americans _ a victory for
health,'' he said.
   In a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, Sullivan, who is black,
said Reynolds' message was ``more disease, more suffering and more
death for a group already bearing more than its share of
smoking-related illness and mortality.''
   Officials with the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company have said
they hoped the cigarette would appeal to blacks, who as a group
prefer menthol cigarettes, according to the company's market
research.
   Philadelphia was chosen because blacks make up 40 percent of the
population, the company said.
   ``Our intentions in test marketing Uptown in Philadelphia have
been misconstrued and misrepresented by the anti-smoking lobby,''
Hoult said. ``Our sole purpose, plainly and simply, was to test
market a cigarette among smokers who currently buy competitive
products.''
   Company spokesman David Fishel said the immediate future of
Uptown is unclear, adding, ``We'll just have to evaluate the
situation.''
   In Philadelphia, leaders of about 30 organizations which had
banded together to fight Uptown expressed joy that the company
decided to heed their opposition.
   The Rev. Jesse Brown, president of the Committee to Prevent
Cancer Among Blacks, called the decision ``magnificent.''
   ``We are glad that R.J. Reynolds decided to hear us,'' he said.
``We don't want this cigarette to be marketed in any city. This
sends a signal to R.J. Reynolds that community groups can rise up
and deal with them.''
   He said that Sullivan's public condemnation of the marketing
plan was ``the icing on the cake'' to the local opposition.
   Charyn Sutton, a member of the Philadelphia chapter of the
National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer and a marketing
consultant for the American Lung Association, said R.J. Reynolds
had to face marketing facts.
   ``I'm personally pleased that the company heard the community.
They had said this was a cigarette that the community wanted. But
we felt there had been no such request that way,'' she said.
   The company's promotional blitz included ads suggesting glamour,
high fashion and nightlife.
   Sullivan, in a letter to R.J. Reynolds, noted that cigarettes
cause an estimated 390,000 deaths _ or more than 1 in every 6 _
annually in the United States, making it the country's leading
cause of preventable death.
   Statistics from the U.S. Public Health Service show that black
men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than white
men, and blacks lose twice as many years of life as do whites
because of smoking-related diseases.

   Here is a chronology of the unrest between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the Soviet Caucasus:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Feb. 28, 1988 _ Demonstrations by Armenians demanding Azerbaijan
cede control of the mostly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region causes
rioting in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, that kills 26 Armenians and six
Azerbaijanis. Soviet troops help quell the clashes, said to be the
most serious outbreak of nationalist unrest in the Soviet Union
since the 1920s.
   May 21 _ Communist Party leaders of both republics are dismissed
after protests in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and Baku, the
Azerbaijani capital.
   July 4 _ Armenian nationalists close the main airport in
Yerevan, and widespread strikes are reported in Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   July 18 _ The Soviet government rejects a decision by
Nagorno-Karabakh to break away from Azerbaijan.
   Sept. 21 - Further turmoil prompts Moscow to declare a state of
emergency in Nagorno-Karabakh. Soviet troops are deployed around
government buildings in Armenia, where demonstrations and strikes
continue.
   Nov. 24 _ The Soviet military takes control of Baku and Yerevan
after several days of clashes that leave at least 28 people dead,
including three soldiers, and 126 wounded. Officials say 100,000
refugees have fled the two republics because of the unrest.
   Dec. 7 _ A major earthquake hits Armenia, killing about 25,000
people.
   Jan. 12, 1989 _ The Soviet government puts Nagorno-Karabakh
under the direct rule of Moscow.
   June _ Strikes and demonstrations continue.
   Aug. 29 _ Soviet troop reinforcements are sent to
Nagorno-Karabakh after renewed fighting between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis.
   Sep. 25 _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calls on leaders of
both republics to negotiate an end to an Azerbaijani rail blockade
that has halted supplies for earthquake reconstruction.
   Nov. 28 _ The Supreme Soviet restores Azerbaijan's control over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Dec. 1 _ The Armenian Parliament condemns Moscow's restoration
of Azerbaijani control over Nagorno-Karabakh and votes to unite
with the territory. The nationalist Azerbaijani Popular Front
reimposes the rail blockade against Armenia.
   Jan. 1, 1990 _ Soviet Azerbaijanis seeking freer travel to visit
their ethnic brethren in neighboring Iran attack border posts,
causing damage and at least one death, according to Soviet media
reports.
   Jan. 14 _ A demonstration in Baku causes rampages by gangs of
Azerbaijani nationalists on Armenians living in the city. At least
25 people are reported killed. Clashes break out in other areas.
   Jan. 15 _ The Soviet Union declares a state of emergency in
parts of Azerbaijan and orders army, navy and KGB security forces
to help contain the fighting.
   Jan. 16 _ The Soviet government sends 11,000 army and internal
police troops to Azerbaijan. The government puts the death toll at
56 in three days of fighting.
   Jan. 17 _ Roadblocks in Azerbaijan prevent the Soviet troops
from moving freely, hindering their deployment. Reports reaching
Moscow indicate Armenians and Azerbaijanis have seized heavy
weapons, with some reports calling the violence a virtual civil war.
   Jan. 19 _ Gorbachev blames the unrest on extremists trying to
undermine his reform proposals and also says some nationalist
Azerbaijanis want to sececde to form a Moslem state. A government
statement warns of a national catastrophe if the unrest continues.
In the face of widespread public protest, the government suspends
the Defense Ministry's callup of reservists to beef up military
units. Soviet reports say weapons have been brought in from Iran by
the demonstrating Azerbaijani nationalists.
   Jan. 20 _ Soviet troops use tanks to break through barricades
and enter Baku, exchanging gunfire with Azerbaijani nationalists.
Initial reports indicate scores of additional deaths.

<HEAD>Aldo Gucci, Son of Leather Goods Company Founder, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aldo Gucci, who helped turn his father's Italian
luxury leather goods company into an international symbol of chic
but whose own son later implicated him for tax evasion, has died.
He was 84.
   No information on when or where he died or the cause was
supplied in a statement Friday from Gucci America in New York
announcing his death. There was no answer at Gucci offices in Italy
today.
   But the Italian news agency ANSA today reported from Florence,
where the company was founded, that Gucci died at a Rome clinic
where he had been hospitalized a week ago for treatment of prostate
cancer.
   ANSA said the funeral would be held at a Roman Catholic church
in Rome on Monday and that the body would be transferred to
Florence for burial in the family mausoleum at a cemetery in that
Tuscan city.
   On Friday, Peggy Rao, who has handled public relations for Gucci
in Palm Beach, Fla., told the Palm Beach Post newspaper that she
had been informed that he died of a cerebral hemmorhage.
   Gucci was responsible for marketing his family's products in the
United States. In 1986, he pleaded guilty to evading $7 million in
taxes and was later implicated in a corporate tax evasion scheme.
   The Gucci company was founded in 1906 in Florence by Guccio
Gucci, a leather goods salesman.
   It was with some reluctance that he watched his son Aldo expand
overseas _ a drive that resulted in 180 stores and about 82 percent
of the parent company's sales today. Aldo Gucci opened the
company's first American store in New York City in 1953.
   Aldo also brought his sons Giorgio, Paolo and Roberto and his
nephew Maurizio into the executive ranks. Paolo later implicated
him for tax evasion, and Maurizio had him ousted in 1984.
   In a statement issued Friday, Maurizio said of his uncle, ``Aldo
Gucci was a man of great vision. His efforts were instrumental in
establishing Gucci as the premier name in luxury leather goods in
the United States.''
   The tax evasion case began when Paolo proposed more inexpensive
products and licensing and was opposed by his relatives.
   In one of two lawsuits Paolo filed against the others, he
charged that the family blocked his efforts to trade under his own
name and he produced documents showing that Aldo, then 81, had
evaded taxes.
   The Internal Revenue Service obtained the documents, and Aldo
pleaded guilty to evading $7 million in personal income taxes in
federal court in Manhattan in 1986. He was sentenced to a year in
prison but was allowed to serve part of the sentence at a halfway
house in West Palm Beach.
   In 1984, Maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize
control, oust Aldo, and bring in new, young, U.S.-educated managers.
   Aldo Gucci resigned as president of Gucci America in 1984 and
was replaced by Domenico De Sole.
   In 1988, Gucci America admitted that the company, under Aldo,
had conspired to cheat the government of corporate taxes between
1972 and 1982, and the firm paid the government $20.5 million in
back taxes, interest and penalties.
   A lawyer for the company told a judge at the time that Gucci
America had foreign corporations submit false invoices for services
never rendered and other phony documents to divert money to Aldo
Gucci, who kept some and distributed the rest among other members
of the family.
   At the time of his death, Aldo Gucci was still acting as a
consultant to the company.

<HEAD>Gunmen Detain Lebanese Journalist Critical of Aoun</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunmen today seized a Lebanese journalist
who has been an outspoken critic of Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun and his campaign to control the nation's media, but released
him unharmed several hours later.
   In southern Lebanon, a United Nations official touring the
Middle East today examined a prison where the Shiite Moslem Amal
militia said a kidnapped U.S. Marine was briefly held before his
reported hanging last year.
   And in England, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie marked
the third anniversary of Terry Waite's abduction in Lebanon by
saying that he longed to celebrate his personal envoy's release
someday soon.
   Gunmen kidnapped Lebanese journalist George Hajj from his
apartment in Christian east Beirut early this morning. He declined
to talk to reporters after his release 8{ hours later, but a
relative said he was in good condition.
   The maverick Aoun, who has been trying to muzzle the Lebanese
news media for about a week, was accused of masterminding Hajj's
abduction from the apartment in the Ashrafiyeh district.
   ``Colleague Hajj's abduction is the latest move in Aoun's war
against freedom of the press,'' said Voice of the Nation, which
interrupted regular programming to broadcast the report.
   Hajj, 55, a frequent critic of the Christian general, works for
the weekly Al-Massirah and the daily Al-Bayrak. He also is a member
of the executive board of the Reporters Syndicate.
   His abduction came as journalists, writers, poets, and
politicians gathered near offices of the Newspaper Publishers'
Syndicate in Moslem west Beirut to protest Aoun's drive to gag the
media.
   Aoun has banned the media from referring to President Elias
Hrawi as head of state and has closed newspapers that defied his
orders.
   Hrawi, shortly after his election by Parliament Nov. 24,
dismissed Aoun as prime minister of an interim military cabinet and
discharged him from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
   Hrawi and Aoun are both Maronites, the Christian community which
has dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.
   Parliament elected Hrawi as part of an Arab League-brokered
peace plan designed to end 14 years of civil war. Aoun has rejected
the accord and declared the one-chamber house dissolved in an
effort to prevent legislators from electing a pro-Syrian head of
state.
   Also today, Aoun's soldiers and Syrian troops skirmished with
machine guns, tank cannons and mortars in the Madfoun Bridge
region, interrupting traffic along the highway which connects
northern Lebanon with the Christian enclave.
   Police reported no casualties.
   In southern Lebanon, Assistant U.N. Secretary-General Marrack
Goulding examined a prison where the Shiite Moslem Amal militia
said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was briefly held
before his reported hanging last year.
   ``There isn't sufficient evidence that Col. Higgins was held
here,'' Goulding told reporters after his tour of the seven-cell
prison in the village of Kawthariet Assiad, 10 miles southeast of
the port city of Sidon.
   Higgins, who headed a U.N. observer team in southern Lebanon,
was kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. The
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it killed him in
July after Israel kidnapped a Hezbollah sheik.
   U.S. intelligence officials believe Higgins, of Danville, Ky.,
was killed a year earlier in retaliation for the U.S. missile
attack on an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf in which 290
people were killed.
   In London, Archbishop Runcie marked the third anniversary of
Waite's abduction. The Anglican envoy was taken hostage Jan. 20,
1987 while seeking to negotiate the release of hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I hope we shall not need to keep this anniversary again. We
long to be able to celebrate Terry's day of release,'' Runcie said.
   Besides Waite, 17 foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon,
including eight Americans. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson,
43, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who
was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Hard-line and liberal Communists
today clashed at a key party congress over how quickly to renounce
their 45-year-old monopoly on power, and hard-liners succeeded in
delaying a vote on democratic reforms. Party President Milan
Pancevski told the congress that the current system of one-party
socialism had ``objectively exhausted its possibilities for
development.''
   Delegates at the four-day meeting considered a document that
backs free elections and a multiparty system, and proclaims the
party's readiness to relinquish its guaranteed grip on power.
   The opening of the congress, broadcast live on Belgrade TV, was
marked by heated debate, with some delegates demanding that the
document be adopted as soon as possible and other cautioning
against a rushed decision.
   Several delegates from the liberal northern republic of Slovenia
urged the document be adopted as it stands as one of the first
agenda items. Hard-liners, mostly from the largest republic of
Serbia, wanted it discussed in committee and adopted together with
other documents at the end of the congress.
   The hard-liners succeeded in sending it to committee, leading to
speculation that it could be watered down there. Although 780
delegates favored the document's immediate adoption, 645 voted
opposed it, denying the motion for a vote the needed two-thirds
majority.
   Stefan Korosec, who presided over the morning plenary session,
said the document would be debated in committee sessions and
adopted at the end of the congress.
   Retired Gen. Dusan Pekic proposed that the Communists urge
Parliament to quickly delete the party's leading role from the
constitution, but delegates voted this down, noting this demand was
contained in the draft reform document.
   The declaration, published last week in the Yugoslav press,
admits that the one-party system of monopoly ``has pushed us into
autocracy and prevented us from keeping up with the economic,
technological, political and social changes in Europe and the
world.''
   The party advocates freeing the political system ``of any
monopoly, including that'' of the Communists, says the document,
which was published and distributed to the press before the
congress opened.
   Proclaiming that ``the end has come for authoritarian
socialism,'' the document says the system of political monopoly
``has pushed us into autocracy and prevented us from keeping up
with the economic, technological, political and social changes in
Europe and the world.''
   It calls for free, independent trade unions, a legal guarantee
of ethnic and other human rights, independent courts, parliamentary
control over the government and a market economy with mixed
ownership.
   The draft document also advocates application for membership in
the European Economic Community and other European trade groups.
   Today's congress, originally scheduled for May but moved ahead
to keep up with the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, immediately
took up debate on the document and the pace of proposed changes.
   Deputy Premier Zivko Pregl told a news conference Friday the
government also would propose constitutional amendments to
Parliament deleting all references to the party's leading role and
reforming the electoral process.
   ``(We) don't feel any political organization or party should be
in the constitution,'' Pregl said.
   Pregl said draft legislation laying the groundwork for
multiparty elections would be completed at a government meeting
Jan. 25. He predicted it would be adopted by Parliament by March 1.
   The government of Premier Ane Markovic has begun putting into
effect an ambitious, market-oriented economic program, but Pregl
said accompanying political changes were also necessary.
   Yugoslavia broke with the Soviet Union in 1948 and established a
largely decentralized Communist system.
   Pregl noted that Yugoslavia had been the most liberal of the
Communist countries until reform surged through the East bloc in
the fall, forcing the Communists in most countries to give up their
hold on power.
   Communists in the liberal northern republics of Slovenia and
Croatia have long tolerated non-Communist political groups and
expressly called for multiparty elections, but hard-line Communists
in the largest republic of Serbia had until recently opposed
lifting Communist dominance.
   Last month, the Serbian Communists also said they backed
multiparty democracy.
   The army has repeatedly rejected multiparty democracy. It says
parties would be formed along ethnic lines, further aggravating
tensions in this fractious country of varied ethnic and religious
groups, many of whom still harbor historical rivalries.
   Petar Simic, head of the Communist leadership in the army, said
in a speech published Friday in the daily Borba that the army would
``not retreat from the idea of Communism.''
   The army in Yugoslavia has a political role unmatched elsewhere
in Eastern Europe. Communist leaders in the military are
represented on all local and federal bodies. Fully 95 percent of
the army officers are Communist Party members.
   If multiparty elections are held in April, as promised by
Communist leaders, the army would no longer be guaranteed a role in
political decision-making.
   However, Simic said the army ``will accept the arguments and the
will of the majority'' at the congress.
   Yugoslav media this week predicted possible clashes between
party hard-liners and liberals, despite tentative agreement on
democratic reforms.

<HEAD>National Head Count Two Months Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seven years of preparation the Census
Bureau is closing in on its biggest job ever: a reasonably precise
tally of the estimated quarter-billion people who live in America.
   The national head count, scheduled for April 1, is just over two
months away.
   But the results will reverberate through American life for a
decade or longer, through the distribution of seats in Congress and
billions of dollars in federal money.
   In addition it will offer details on habits, incomes and living
arrangements.
   This will be the 21st time the United States government has set
out to make an exact count of its denizens. That goal has never
been reached, but census officials expect to come closer than ever.
   ``We are prepared to chase and chase and chase again,'' said
Census Director Barbara E. Bryant. The bureau estimates that it
counted 98.4 percent of the population in 1980.
   This census has already generated controversy over counting
illegal aliens and homeless Americans, adjusting the expected
undercount to make sure the figures reflect the real number of poor
and minority group members, and hiring the 300,000 temporary
workers needed.
   The census is, in fact, the product of a political compromise at
the heart of how this nation is governed.
   Since the states couldn't agree on their representation in
Congress they decided to count the population every 10 years and
use that result to adjust the House of Representatives.
   That was done for the first time in 1790, when federal marshals
went out and counted heads.
   They found 3,929,214. That resulted in a complaint from
President Washington, who said he was sure there were at least 4
million people in the country.
   Similar complaints have followed every count since then and have
already surfaced this time, in the form of a lawsuit asking that
the 1990 count be adjusted upward.
   ``Adjustment of census data is a demographic Pandora's box,''
says Agriculture Department population expert Calvin Beale, ``I
hope it does not happen.''
   Regardless of whether there are 4 million or 250 million people,
counting everyone is a problem.
   Some people don't want to be counted. Some are away from home.
Some are simply overlooked. Some fear government officials or lack
interest in official activities.
   The distribution of billions of federal dollars is based on
census counts, making the tally especially important for the poor,
minorities and others who depend on government programs.
   Cities with large minority populations would like to see the
final numbers adjusted to allow for the likelihood that blacks and
Hispanics will be undercounted.
   Another hard-to-count group is the nation's growing army of
homeless people.
   This has prompted a special effort, scheduled for the night of
March 20, when census takers will visit homeless shelters, homes
for battered women and flophouses, and will walk the streets and
alleys looking for homeless people to be counted.
   Such an effort is reminiscent of the old-fashioned census
methods, when enumerators went from home to home to make the count.
   In recent years that has given way to a mail count, with census
forms being mailed March 23 to 80 percent of homes, with people
asked to mail them back as of April 1.
   Officials are hoping for a strong mailback response, since
people who don't fill in the form and send it back must be visited
later by census takers.
   That visit costs money, though, and with the count expected to
cost $2.6 billion overall, the government doesn't want to spend any
more than necessary.
   One question that has come under nearly continual discussion
since census preparations began in 1983 is the problem of illegal
aliens, who are believed to shun government workers out of fear of
being deported.
   Politicians from states with few illegal aliens have complained
that these people should not be counted, because that would result
in an unfair increase in the number of Congress seats given to
states with plenty of undocumented aliens.
   The Constitution, however, specifies that all ``persons'' must
be counted, not just citizens, so everyone is included.
   Census officials note that they don't ask if people are
citizens, so they have no way of knowing whether a person is a
legal or illegal resident of the country.
   Overall, 110 million households are expected to be counted,
totaling about 250 million Americans. Most will get the short form,
taking about 15 minutes to fill out. One home in six will get the
long form which takes about 45 minutes.

<HEAD>Ethnic Grievances Boiling Over From Caucasus to Baltics</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Central Asia to the Caucasus and the Baltics,
ancient ethnic grievances and nationalist fervor are rising in the
security cordon the Kremlin built.
   Grudges among neighbors that simmered quietly under the Soviet
facade of brotherhood, and demands for independence, ultimately
could erode Moscow's vast empire.
   The breeding grounds are southern deserts, the Caucasus
Mountains, the fields and forests of Moldavia, the black, fertile
soil of the Ukraine and the Baltics in the north. In those areas
live many of the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing bitter strife between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis, told the country he was struggling with
a legacy of ethnic hatred.
   ``The problems, which have been accumulating for tens _ no, for
hundreds of years _ have erupted and acquired the character we are
now confronted with,'' he told a meeting in Moscow on Thursday.
   In Lithuania less than a week earlier, where Gorbachev was
trying to rein in a peaceful, but determined secessionist movement,
the Soviet leader openly worried that demands for independence
could lead to ``the union's disintegration on ethnic grounds.''
   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost and democratic reforms has let
genies out of bottles, in many cases with violent consequences.
Formerly underground and long-repressed groups seek secession from
the Soviet Union for Georgia, Armenia, Moldavia, Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia.
   Long before Gorbachev, the czars pushed south into Central Asia
and the Caucasus and west into the Baltics and Moldavia in the 18th
and 19th centuries. They brought under their control lands
bordering other major empires that frequently threatened invasion.
   With arrests, deportations, pogroms, discrimination or murder,
the Russian czars did little to make the local populations like
their masters in Moscow.
   Alexander III introduced Russification _ to make all Russian in
character _ angering non-Russian peoples. His son Nicholas II, the
last czar, continued that approach.
   Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin called the Russian Empire that
the Bolsheviks inherited a ``prison of nations.'' In 1917, the year
of the Bolshevik Revolution, peasants angered by the postponement
of agrarian reform struck out at Russian settlers.
   In the early years of Soviet power under Lenin, nationalist
ferment was high in Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Central Asia,
Transcaucasia and the Baltics, the same areas where troubles abound
now.
   Many states, like the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, took Lenin's policy of national self-determination to
heart and declared their independence.
   But Stalin followed Lenin and took the areas back under Kremlin
control in his effort to rebuild the security ring.
   Stalin seized the three Baltic republics in 1940.
   Stalin was a Georgian, but like the czars he tried to Russify
the areas ruled by Moscow. Moldavia, for example, was regained from
Romania in 1940 and the language was converted from Latin to
Cyrillic letters in an attempt to make it seem more Russian.
   Armenians and Georgians _ two Christian ethnic groups in the
Caucasus that in the 19th and early 20th centuries sought
protection of the Russian czar against the Ottoman Empire _ now are
among those fighting most vigorously for independence.
   After Gorbachev took power, Crimean Tatars and Armenians led the
way for other nationalities in voicing their grievances. The
Crimean Tatars demanded to resettle in the Crimean peninsula, from
which they were deported by Stalin. The Armenians wanted to regain
control over Nagorno-Karabakh, a small mountainous territory Stalin
had transferred to Azerbaijan in 1923.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has turned out to be the bloodiest
ethnic feud in recent years, and it is the focus of the latest and
most dangerous flare-up.
   But that is just the tip of the iceberg. In Central Asia, where
the Red Army reasserted Soviet power after 1917, Uzbeks attacked
Meshkhetian Turks last June in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan,
leaving more than 100 people dead. Abkhazians clashed with
Georgians, who also fought with Ossetians.
   Some experts have estimated there are 40 areas of the Soviet
Union where uprooted populations could make territorial claims.
   Soviet officials worried out loud about a chain reaction or
domino effect in the campaigns to assert national rights.
   Calls for independence were heard in the Ukraine, the
second-largest of the 15 republics, in September when activists
there formed the Rukh political movement, modeled after the
People's Front organizations that are pressing independence in the
Baltics and elsewhere.
   A serious secessionist effort in the Ukraine would bring the
problem much closer to Moscow than the unrest in the Caucasus or
the Baltics. The Ukraine is the cradle of Russian civilization and
a contemporary industrial and agricultural powerhouse with 50
million residents,
   Gorbachev's position on the Soviet republics seems to ethnic
activists to be at odds with his encouragement of democratic
reforms in Eastern Europe.
   While promising the 15 republics and autonomous national regions
within them greater control over their economic, cultural and
political affairs in a newly restructured federation, Gorbachev has
consistently ruled out redrawing borders.
   He has also emphasized the historical and economic ties linking
Baltic residents, Uzbeks, Armenians and Azerbaijanis to the Soviet
Union.
   In a speech in Lithuania, he made clear the solutions must be
found in his reform program.
   ``Only civil peace, the coordination of interests on the basis
of reciprocity and the active pooling of efforts on the principles
of perestroika to solve tasks and achieve the objectives of this
policy can lead the country out of the present difficult
situation,'' the Soviet leader said.

<HEAD>SOVIET UNION:</HEAD>

   Soviet troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital of Baku today,
punched through barricades erected by militants and reportedly
killed dozens of people in an attempt to end ethnic violence and
territorial disputes in the region. Up to 60 people were reported
killed. The government declared a state of emergency in Baku. The
government on Friday suspended the Defense Ministry's callup of
reservists to beef up military units in the face of widespread
public protest.

   Hard-line and liberal Communists today clashed at a key party
congress over how quickly to renounce their 45-year-old monopoly on
power, and hard-liners succeeded in delaying a vote on democratic
reforms. Delegates are considering a document that backs free
elections and a multiparty system, and proclaims the party's
readiness to relinquish its guaranteed grip on power.

<HEAD>CZECHOSLOVAKIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II today accepted an invitation
to visit Czechoslovakia, and his spokesman said the trip would take
place sometime before the Czechoslovak elections in June. The
Czechoslovak government said Thursday that it wants to re-establish
diplomatic relations with the Vatican that have been suspended for
40 years. The change is possible now because a popular revolution
recently ousted Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist leaders,
leading to broad democratic reforms, including religious freedom.

   The West German airline Lufthansa and the East German state
carrier Interflug are planning to build an international airport to
serve both East and West Berlin. The airport south of Berlin would
be completed by the year 2005 and could handle 30 million
passengers a year. Officials say they expect Interflug to double
its number of passengers to 6 million this year as a result of East
Germany's decision in November to open its Western borders.

<HEAD>Congress Eyes Defense Cuts as Deficit Reduction Effort Resumes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reduced east-west tensions are prompting
Congress to weigh possible cuts in defense as lawmakers resume
their search for ways to turn back a tide of red ink in the federal
budget.
   Also high on the agenda as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on
Tuesday are ethics legislation, campaign finance reform, President
Bush's push to cut the capital gains tax and foreign policy for a
rapidly changing world.
   But crafting a military budget at a time when Americans perceive
a lessening Soviet threat and increased need to reduce the deficit
is expected to dominate the 1990 congressional session.
   ``My constituents ask, `Isn't the Berlin Wall now a speed
bump?''' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``They really are thinking how do
we get out of debt. They just aren't buying that we need
everything.''
   Already a handful of lawmakers, including liberal Reps. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., are talking about how
to spend the so-called ``peace dividend'' that remains.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, says the Bush administration's defense plan for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will not produce such a dividend.
   But Sasser said Bush's proposal, which includes canceling the
B-2 stealth bomber, the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the V-22
tilt-rotor transport, would result in $93 billion in savings from
1991-1994.
   On Jan. 29, President Bush most likely will submit a package
totaling about $292 billion, which amounts to 2 percent less than
what is necessary to keep this year's $287 billion level at pace
with inflation.
   But with the Soviets loosening their grip on Eastern Europe,
domestic programs clamoring for cash and a nagging budget deficit,
calls are guaranteed to resound in Congress for substantial defense
reductions.
   ``The budget that comes to us in 10 days will undoubtedly be
cut,'' House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said in a
speech Thursday.
   He urged the Bush administration to delay production of costly,
high-tech weapons such as the stealth Advanced Tactical Fighter and
concentrate instead on research.
   Weapons systems that have taken large chunks out of the budget
in the past, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-2
stealth bomber and land-based nuclear missiles, will be the focus
for lawmakers willing to cut defense spending.
   ``The defense budget is being looked upon as the cash register,
regrettably,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said.
   With defense cuts likely, and the entire House and one-third of
the Senate up for re-election, support is expected to grow for some
way to soften the blow for districts dependant on military
contracts.
   Legislation introduced in the past by Reps. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.,
Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., and Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., will be
fodder for a compromise bill the Democratic leadership hopes to
adopt.
   On other issues, Congress tackles the ethics problems of 11
members, including five senators who intervened with banking
regulators on behalf of the owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and
Loan, Charles H. Keating Jr. Also facing congressional inquiries
are three House members accused of improper sexual behavior.
   Clashes with the administration are expected over Bush's call
for a reduction in the capital-gains tax and his rejection of a
proposed cut in social security taxes.
   Democrats narrowly defeated the capital gains proposal in 1989,
saying a cut would prove to be a windfall for the rich. But many
concede prospects for passage this year are fairly good.
   A rollback in the Social Security tax proposed by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is being condemned by Bush as a charade
that would force a hike in other taxes or a cut in retirement
benefits.
   But Moynihan's plan has put the administration on the spot,
gaining wide support and fueling election-year claims that Bush is
espousing a capital gains break for the rich while rejecting relief
for poor and middle-class Americans.
   The foreign policy debate will center on aid for Eastern Europe
and whether to reward the new democracies in the crumbling Warsaw
Pact.
   A number of regional hotspots also head the foreign policy
agenda. In Central America, the United States must mend fences with
nations angered by the U.S. invasion of Panama. And many lawmakers
are critical of the administration's overtures to the repressive
regime in China.
   Congress this week weighs Bush's veto last year of a bill that
would potentially permit more than 30,000 Chinese students to
remain in the United States when their visas expire rather than
forcing them to return to their homeland.
   An override of the veto is possible in the House, but its fate
in the Senate is uncertain.

<HEAD>`Independent' Advisers Have Financial Ties to Weapons Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two companies hired by the Energy
Department as independent investigators of environmental and safety
conditions at nuclear weapons plants are on the payroll at
facilities they investigated, government records show.
   Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department
contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet
working there. Still others, while not associated with the plants
they audited, are the Energy Department's prime contractors at
other nuclear bomb factories.
   Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent
tiger team'' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding
organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as
a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently
planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate
to the work to be performed'' and which may bias its judgment.
   The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants'
compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health
standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for
actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants.
   Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe
environmental problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up
production wastes are as high as $100 billion.
   Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams
but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the
weapons business.
   The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to
comment on whether the contractors' connections to the weapons
industry amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the
independence of the investigations or taints the findings.
   Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department
would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don't
have the people to do it.''
   Each team is headed by a small number of department officials,
but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most
have extensive backgrounds in nuclear environmental and safety
matters.
   A review of department records as well as interviews with
government and industry officials show that of the eight weapons
plant investigations done last year, at least three involved
companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same
sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities.
   _The engineering and environmental consulting firm NUS Corp. of
Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12
uranium processing plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According
to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak
Ridge reservation on an environmental study of its nuclear and
hazardous waste management. The Y-12 plant is one of several
operations at the Oak Ridge reservation.
   NUS's Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was
valued at $1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons
facilities in South Carolina and Idaho.
   NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the
firm's work for the Energy Department.
   _Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif.,
helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground
nuclear weapons tests. The company at the same time was working at
the site under two Energy Department contracts with a combined
value of $100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level
nuclear waste dump at the site that was not part of the tiger team
audit.
   _ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction company
based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the
Nevada Test Site.
   ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test site at the
time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a
$5 million job to help the facility's prime contractor, Reynolds
Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an
environmental cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won
the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1.
   Similarly, records show the company participated in tiger team
investigations at the Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio and
the Y-12 Oak Ridge plant while it was a bidder for major Energy
Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is
valued at $505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch,
deputy director of the department's field office there.
   Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a
telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his
company's involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not
sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or
cared about the company's other work at the weapons plants.
   ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors
had to be used,'' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we
were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.''
   The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the
nuclear weapons plants since they were built as part of the World
War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on
Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with
little internal expertise in this area and a tendency to rely on
the weapons makers to police themselves.
   Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with
environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence
on private contractors.
   Although the department insists that the tiger team members'
links to the weapons industry do not compromise their objectivity
as judges of environmental and safety conditions at the plants,
some outside experts disagree.
   ``It's inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is
reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible
criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for
another contractor,'' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science
professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on
government use of contractors.
   Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running
nuclear weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated.
These include EG&amp;G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky
Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver, the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval
nuclear fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which
makes detonators for nuclear arms.
   Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge
facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries
of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites,
and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final
weapons assembly plant near Amarillo, Texas.

<HEAD>US Shifts Stance, Will Allow Involuntary Repatriation To Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will no longer oppose
Britain's decision to forcibly send back refugees from Hong Kong to
Vietnam, officials say.
   In exchange, the United States is demanding that Britain stop
the involuntary repatriation of the refugees for one year. During
that time, relief workers will try to convince the ``boat people''
it is safe for them to go back to Vietnam, said the officials.
   The revised U.S. position will be presented at an 18-nation
meeting Tuesday in Geneva where a solution will be sought to the
growing number of Vietnamese stranded in Hong Kong, Thailand and
other Southeast Asian countries.
   Britain has indicated it will reject the yearlong moratorium,
but a compromise _ possibly of six months _ is expected to emerge
at the two-day meeting, the officials said.
   The American decision, adopted after months of agonizing
deliberations, will anger a strong lobby of Asian Americans and
members of Congress opposed to any forced repatriation.
   ``There isn't a good solution to this,'' said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's simply the lesser of
evils.''
   For months, the United States rejected any involuntary
repatriation to Vietnam, citing the country's repressive Stalinist
government and extreme poverty. But the problem has grown
increasingly acute with a sharp increase of refugees fleeing
Vietnam in rickety boats since last spring.
   More than 60,000 left Vietnam last year, the highest number
since 1981, bringing to about 120,000 the number of boat people in
those so-called first asylum countries in Southeast Asia. A
majority are in Hong Kong, and the rest in the Philippines,
Malaysia and Thailand. A small number reached Singapore and Japan.
   Under a plan adopted in Geneva by the 18 nations last June,
46,000 of the boat people will be resettled in the West over the
next 3 years, about half in the United States.
   Those who return to Vietnam receive $650 from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees and a guarantee against reprisal or
persecution.
   The British, citing cramped conditions for refugees on the
already crowded island of Hong Kong, decreed that all boat people
who sailed to the colony after June 1988 were illegal immigrants
unless able to prove they fled persecution rather than economic
hardships.
   The British also sought approval from the international
community for sending back Vietnamese even if they refused to go,
and forcibly sent back 51 refugees from Hong Kong last month.
   The United States found itself increasingly isolated among the
18 nations of the Geneva agreement, with only Vietnam and the
Soviets on its side.
   ``We feel we must make some accommodation with the British,''
said the same official. ``Not that we like it, but we're afraid if
we don't, we'll lose even the first asylum countries'' such as Hong
Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
   Fearful of being saddled with thousands of Vietnamese refugees
who are ineligible for resettlement elsewhere, Malaysia has pushed
away 60 boatloads of Vietnamese, said the official. There have been
several cases of Thailand doing so as well.
   ``We're going to demand iron clad guarantees'' that the
international community shoulder the burden of repatriating the
Vietnamese and that the U.N. high commissioner can monitor against
persecution, he said.
   So far, about 900 Vietnamese have gone back voluntarily. But the
United States believes that with the right counseling, more can be
persuaded to return, the official said.
   ``They basically have to understand that they will receive
financial help, that the U.N. will make sure they're not
persecuted, and that their only other choice is to rot in camps''
in other countries, he said.
   The United States will ask Japan, Australia and Britain to
contribute heavily to the repatriation fund, he said.
   The United States has taken in 900,000 of the 1.5 million who
fled Vietnam since the war ended in 1975.

<HEAD>Members of the Atlanta Police Bomb Squad Work On The Thin Edge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When members of the Atlanta police bomb squad
were called last month to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
they quickly realized they were dealing with someone whose only
interest was murder.
   ``We knew we had a federal judge in Alabama that had been killed
by one that blew up,'' recalled Sgt. William H. Briley, bomb squad
supervisor. ``We knew we had an intact item here that was
definitely deadly, but if we could disrupt it, we might gain some
valuable information.
   ``I thought that was important enough to stick my neck out on a
limb.''
   He took the bomb to a police shooting range and dismantled it.
   Investigators believe the bomb Briley dismantled Dec. 18 is
related to ones that killed Judge Robert Vance of the 11th Circuit
in suburban Birmingham, Ala., and Savannah attorney Robert
Robinson, plus another bomb sent to the Jacksonville, Fla., office
of the NAACP at about the same time.
   A letter to an Atlanta television station said a group called
``Americans for a Competent Federal Judiciary System'' sent the
bombs to protest what it called preferential treatment of black
suspects. No arrests have been made.
   Briley would not discuss the contents of the bomb except to say
it was a powerful one. But he said handling it or any other bomb,
is a test of wits pitting the officer against the bomb builder.
   ``Nothing is absolute. The building of a bomb is limited only by
the imagination and ability of the builder,'' said Briley. ``You
realize some day someone is going to build one you can't figure
out.''
   In the month since the bombings, the Atlanta bomb squad has
handled more than 100 suspicious packages but found no more
explosives.
   Each call is handled as if the package were a bomb. Portable
X-ray equipment is used to try to determine what's inside. Then the
decision is made whether the package is safe, whether to move it,
detonate it or dismantle it.
   After that, it's up to the skill of the individual bomb
technician.
   ``If you mess up, you've done just exactly what he wanted you to
do and you might lose your life real easy,'' Briley said. ``We try
to do this according to procedures, but there's no way you can
guarantee you won't be killed.''
   Briley has been with the bomb squad, a small unit within the
city police Special Weapons and Tactics unit, since it was founded
12 years ago. Its members have passed a four-week course in
explosives handling given by the U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal in
Huntsville, Ala.
   The squad's equipment includes X-ray machines, a bomb-handling
container, an armored trailer for transporting explosives and
armored suits that provide some protection in case of explosion,
``but if you're right over it, nothing is going to help.''
   While the courthouse episode received a lot of publicity, many
lesser known operations are just as dangerous. Briley said there
were cases in California of people being killed disposing of
fireworks, and discarded dynamite is particularly dangerous because
it becomes more unstable as it deteriorates.
   Briley says he ``couldn't think of any place I wouldn't rather
have been'' that Dec. 18, but describes the intensity of feeling
that goes through a squad member after a successful mission.
   ``The relief with something like this is something you can't
feel. The blood is flowing through your body at such a rate it
doesn't automatically slow down,'' he said. ``You can feel it in
your movements.''

<HEAD>Gov't Uses Troops to Oust Governor, Supporters</HEAD>

   Government forces on Saturday ousted
a provincial governor suspected of backing the December coup
attempt, forcing his supporters from the local capitol building
with tear gas and clubs, a radio report said.
   The action was widely seen as a barometer of the resolve of
President Corazon Aquino to punish participants in coup attempts.
   The independent radio station DZRH said local government
Secretary Luis Santos ordered troops to disperse about 10,000
supporters of Rodolfo Aguinaldo, governor of Cagayan province in
northern Luzon island. The forces were flown in from Manila, about
200 miles to the south.
   For several days, scores of Aguinaldo's youthful supporters
prevented Santos and Vice Gov. Melvin Vargas from entering the
capitol building at Tuguegarao.
   ``I will not allow the dignity of this office (to) get trampled
upon by your governor,'' Santos said. Of the defiant supporters, he
said, ``We will clear them up.''
   The Supreme Court upheld a government decision to suspend
Aguinaldo on Jan. 6 because he allegedly threatened to send troops
and tanks to Manila last month to support the bid to oust Mrs.
Aquino.
   DZRH said the government forces Saturday fired several rounds of
tear-gas canisters, and units armed with truncheons and shields
pushed back the crowd to allow Santos, Vargas and military
officials to enter the provincial capitol.
   Santos swore in Vargas as acting governor after Aguinaldo was
seized. Aguinaldo was ordered suspended 60 days while authorities
investigate his alleged role in the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, the
radio station said.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos claimed Aguinaldo
agreed to vacate his office at midday Friday, but Aguinaldo later
denied that report.
   In addition to the latest accusations, Aguinaldo was implicated
_ but never charged _ in an August 1987 coup attempt. Afterward, he
resigned from the military and raised his own private army,
ostensibly to fight Communist rebels.
   He was elected governor of Cagayan by a landslide in January
1988.

   The leaders of France and Britain on Saturday held
another in a series of meetings to discuss the political
developments in Eastern Europe.
   Neither President Francois Mitterrand nor Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher commented after their 90-minute meeting,
described as a working lunch.
   The meeting was the latest of several between the two leaders
that have focused on the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern Europe
and the possibility that the two Germanys may eventually reunify.
   Both leaders believe that to secure the recent democratic

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his ambitious program of
political and economic reforms.

   Soviet troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital
today, punched through barricades erected by militants and
reportedly killed dozens of people in an attempt to end ethnic
violence and territorial disputes in the region.
   ``The street is covered with blood,'' Vadim Korsh, an editor of
Azerbaijan's official news agency, Azerinform, said of the scene of
one of the biggest clashes, the military garrison in the capital,
Baku.
   Corpses were strewn on the road to Baku's airport, he said in a
telephone interview from the southern Soviet city of 1.8 million.
   The government declared a state of emergency in Baku, which was
reported to be paralyzed and heavily patrolled by troops with tanks.
   Authorities say Armenian and Azerbaijani ``warriors'' are armed
with stolen helicopters, tanks and even ground-to-ground missiles.
   The government on Friday suspended the Defense Ministry's callup
of reservists to beef up military units in the face of widespread
public protest.
   Reports of the number of deaths conflicted. Korsh said the
office of Baku's mayor reported the death toll was 60. Alexander A.
Bessmertnykh, first deputy Soviet foreign minister, said eight
soldiers and more than 40 people who attacked the troops were
killed. He told a briefing in Moscow his information came from
Azerbaijan's Interior Ministry, which oversees the republic's
police.
   Activists spoke of much higher death tolls.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev discussed the crisis in a
nationally televised address tonight in which he said the crackdown
was necessary because two years of trying to solve the ethnic
conflict peacefully had failed.
   Militants were forming their own bands of warriors, arming them
and killing people, Gorbachev said. ``This had to stop,'' he said.
   Azerinform reported hundreds of wounded, but no exact figure was
available from the agency or other sources.
   If the death toll of 60 is confirmed, the toll in the Caucasus
violence that began a week ago would be more than 140 people killed
and more than 220 wounded. Western reporters have been banned from
the region.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly warned that the violence between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians, which has deep historical roots, could
cause a national tragedy by igniting other territorial disputes and
pro-independence movements that could jeopardize his program of
economic and political reforms.
   Today's violence and confusion were further complicated by more
daring and unexpected political moves by Azerbaijanis.
   The legislature of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic voted to
secede from Azerbaijan as well as from the U.S.S.R., the Interior
Ministry in Moscow and Iran's official news agency reported.
   Nakhichevan is a small Azerbaijani enclave of a quarter-million
people surrounded by Armenian, Iranian and Turkish territory. It
has been under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction since 1924.
   Asked about the decision, Bessmertnykh told reporters it was
unprecedented and condemned it as an illegal act violating the
Soviet Constitution, which requires the consent of the host
republic for autonomous districts to secede.
   Iran's official news agency said the Nakhichevan's Supreme
Soviet demanded that Soviet troops leave the enclave and called on
Turkey, Iran and the United Nations to help safeguard its
territorial integrity and prevent a massacre.
   Territorial disputes are at the heart of the unrest that is
sweeping Azerbaijan and the neighboring republic of Armenia.
Armenians launched a campaign two years ago to wrest control of the
district of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan. On Jan. 13,
Azerbaijanis staged anti-Armenian riots in Baku, and fighting
between both ethnic groups spread throughout the region.
   Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem, and Armenians are mostly
Christian.
   Troops were reported to have moved into Baku, a Caspian Sea port
city, early today. Official media said military units entered Baku,
were fired on by militants of the Azerbaijan's Popular Front, a
group that has organized anti-Armenian protests, and ``were forced
to retaliate.''
   The rebels reportedly blocked roads with buses, trucks and cars
in an effort to prevent troop movements.
   Nazim Ragimov, an unofficial journalist, said he saw 12 corpses
and that battles continued overnight. Korsh said shots were ringing
out and tanks and armored personnel carriers patrolled during the
day. A Radio Moscow correspondent reported from Baku that cordons
of soldiers were massed in the capital's main square and that they
wore flak jackets and helmets.
   Activists said tens of thousands of people poured into the
square, outside the Communist Party headquarters, this afternoon to
demand that the republic's legislature meet in emergency session to
demand the resignation of party chief Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov and the
lifting of the state of emergency.
   Gorbachev signed a decree today extending to Baku a state of
emergency imposed earlier in the week in other strife-torn parts of
the Caucasus.
   Radio Moscow said the action by the government's highest
executive body followed ``attempts by criminal extremist forces,
through violence and mass disturbances, to depose the legally
functioning state bodies.''
   The broadcast said the measure forbids strikes, and street
processions, the use of duplicating equipment and the use of
transport without special permission. Bessmertnykh told reporters
the measures and introduction of troops had improved the situation.
``Things are better than they were before troops were introduced,''
he said.
   But the reports of mass rallies and the continued sound of
gunshots ringing out in the capital indicated otherwise.
   Soviet army and internal security troops have been building up
in Armenia and Azerbaijan for several days, but they had not
entered Baku until today.
   Leila Unusova, a spokeswoman for an organization calling itself
the Azerbaijani Social Democrat Group, reported by telephone from
Baku that Soviet troops had surrounded the square near the
Communist Party headquarters where 30,000 Azerbaijanis had gathered
in an anti-government protest. She said the forces included armored
personnel carriers, water cannons and other military equipment, but
she did not know whether soldiers there had opened fire.
   ``Our citizens blockaded roads on the south and north with cars
and buses,'' she said. ``Young people, 20 to 25 years old, were
there'' manning the barricades. Korsh said tanks and armored
personnel carriers plowed through the barricades, running over
anyone in their way.
   Shortly after midnight Friday, Ms. Unusova said, Soviet army
troops entered the city from the north and from a base inside the
Baku military academy and opened fire on the militants' positions.
The biggest battles reportedly raged around the airport and
military garrison, where armed protesters had been trying to
prevent troop reinforcements from traveling to the strife-torn
areas.
   Wounded were being taken to three hospitals in the city, Ms.
Unusova said.
   ``It's very dangerous on the street,'' Ms. Unusova said four
hours after the shooting started. ``Battles are still going on.''

<HEAD>Bush Soars in Polls, Tops Reagan's Rating After Year in Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush gets a higher approval rating
in polls than Ronald Reagan did eight years ago, though only one in
five Americans realizes it, a group that studies public awareness
of the news said Saturday.
   ``That perception may prove to be as important to the president
as his actual standing in the opinion polls,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of surveys for Times Mirror Center for People and the
Press.
   Times Mirror said its latest survey, conducted just after
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega surrendered to American
authorities, showed 81 percent approval of the way Bush is handling
his job after a year in office.
   This compares with 49 percent for Reagan in January, 1982, when
the country was slipping into a recession from which it later
recovered.
   The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, also conducted after
the U.S. invasion of Panama, gave Bush an approval rating of 79
percent, six points higher than what Reagan ever achieved as
president.
   Only one person in five, however, had the impression that Bush
is more popular than Reagan was at the corresponding point in his
first term.
   ``If fifty years of history tell us anything, Bush's approval
ratings are likely to fall well below their current mark,'' Kohut
said. ``The question for Bush watchers is whether the president's
quiet popularity, at what may be the peak of his approval ratings,
can cushion him during the trough in his ratings.''
   ``In Washington politics, perceptions of popularity count a
lot,'' he said. ``A serious decline in the approval rating of a
popular president, who is not perceived as popular, might prove
more costly than it did for a leader like Reagan, whose perceived
public esteem was often ahead of his actual scores.''
   Forty percent of the people surveyed by Times Mirror said they
thought Bush was less popular than Reagan, compared with 20 percent
who said he was more popular. Another 36 percent said the two were
about equally popular.
   ``To some extent, this disparity between perception and reality
may be explained by the difference in intensity of public feelings
toward the two leaders,'' Kohut said. ``But, so far, those
differences tend to be relatively small.''
   Over the course of the Reagan presidency, about half of those
who approved of the president did so strongly, the Times Mirror
official said. In the Washington Post-ABC poll about one out of
three persons in the sample strongly approved of Bush's job
performance, the highest level of strong support for him since he
took office.
   A Gallup poll earlier this month showed Bush with an 80 percent
approval rating, higher than that for any other president at the
same point in his first term since World War II.

   An 18-year-old man was arrested Saturday morning
and charged with slashing actress Viveca Lindfors and a second
person with a razor in Greenwich Village last weekend, police said.
   Peter Bedford was arrested at a friend's house in Brooklyn after
police received an anonymous tip, said police spokesman Sgt. Norris
Hollomon.
   Bedford was charged with two counts of assault and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, Hollomon said. The razor allegedly
used in the attacks was not recovered.
   Hollomon said he didn't know what the motive was.
   He is accused of slashing Ms. Lindfors, 69, and Dennis Beal, 36,
on the face and head in separate incidents as they walked through
Greenwich Village early in the morning of Jan. 13. The attacks
occurred about three blocks and five minutes apart.
   Both victims said they were accosted by a gang of young people
and one member of the gang did the slashing.
   The Swedish-born Ms. Lindfors, who appeared in the movie ``The
Way We Were,'' needed 27 stitches after the attack. Beal required
40 stitches to close his wound.

   In a bid to attract tourism, the
government may change a policy that has kept the Malaysia-Thailand
border closed at night for 41 years, the prime minister said
Saturday.
   The minister, Mahathir Mohamad, said security along the border
has improved since the government and guerrillas of the outlawed
Communist Party of Malaya reached an agreement recently ending the
party's 41-year insurgency.
   The guerrillas had operated mostly in border areas.
   Mahathir told reporters the proposal is in line with the
government's objective of attracting more tourists to the country,
especially from Thailand. The decision to extend the checkpoint
hours, now 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., will be made after Mahathir meets with
security officials about tightening anti-smuggling controls along
the border, the National News Agency Bernama reported.

<HEAD>Booze Consumption Rises After Iceland Lifts Beer Restriction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The consumption of alcohol shot up
more than 20 percent in Iceland last year after the nation lifted a
73-year ban on the sale of strong beer, a study indicates.
   Figures released Friday by the state alcohol monopoly show that
Icelanders over the age of 15 consumed an average of 9.7 pints of
pure alcohol in beer, spirits and other drinks in 1989, compared
with 7.88 pints the year before.
   The organization said the 22.9 percent rise in consumption was
largely due to the legalization March 1, 1989 of beer with more
than 2.25 percent alcohol.
   The move was greeted with many parties, bar openings and offers
of free drinks, and by dire predictions that public drunkeness
would increase.
   Before that, Icelanders could drink spirits, wine and
low-alcohol beer but could not legally buy strong beer except at
airport duty-free stores.

   Four white supremacists demonstrated near the
gravesite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. today as more than
2,500 police and National Guard troops kept counterdemonstrators a
distance.
   The Mississippi-based leader of the Nationalist Movement,
Richard Barrett, was accompanied by three supporters as he read
statements reviling King at the King National Historic Site, across
the street from the civil rights leader's tomb.
   ``That grave is not a throne. That corpse is not a king. We are
here to bury a tyranny,'' Barrett said. His group left with a
police escort less than an hour later, to jeers from about 75
mostly young and racially mixed counterdemonstrators who gathered
in fog and drizzle.
   Plans for what President Bush denounced Friday as ``a rally of
hate'' caused the adjacent Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change to close for the day.
   Civil rights activist Hosea Williams, who had planned to gather
supporters at King's tomb, settled for briefly parking two busloads
of people near the police lines and then headed north to virtually
all-white Forsyth County, where Barrett planned to march later.
   Around noon, about 60 supporters of Williams, a former King aide
and Atlanta city councilman, were marching toward Cumming, about an
hour ride from Atlanta. Some onlookers greeted the civil rights
supporters with Confederate battle flags.
   Some of the Atlanta counterdemonstrators, who took to the
streets against the wishes of civil rights groups, used bullhorns
to criticize police for protecting the white supremacists. The
counterdemonstrators, including members of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade, could get no closer than 200 yards to
Barrett.
   Atlanta police said there were two arrests _ one for disorderly
conduct and one for public drunkenness _ in the vicinity of the
rally.
   Many Americans regard King's tomb _ and the surrounding blocks
where he grew up and preached _ as a sacred place, said Randolph
Scott, director of the King federal historic site.
   ``We feel the same way,'' Scott said. ``But he (Barrett) does
have the right to protest, like any other group. We would have
hoped he would have selected some other site ... but we couldn't
deny him.''
   President Bush, in Atlanta on Friday at a homebuilders'
convention, denounced the Barrett protest.
   ``Atlanta is a great, cheerful city that has proudly risen from
the ashes of a distant past,'' Bush said. ``And so, for those who
plan to revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow, let them know this:
Atlantans, like all Americans, turn their backs on bigots.''
   The security surrounding today's events was nothing new; more
than 2,400 police, National Guards troops and other law enforcement
officers were called out to seal off the state Capitol area two
weeks ago for a rally by a Ku Klux Klan group.
   The estimated total cost of the security was $500,000, and the
governor said this week he was ``very troubled'' by the burden such
demonstrations were placing on Georgia taxpayers.
   Forsyth County, a virtually all-white rural and suburban area
north of Atlanta, is the site where Williams and a group of
``brotherhood marchers'' in January 1987 were pelted with rocks by
a jeering crowd.
   After publicity over the violence, Williams returned the next
week with 20,000 supporters in one of the largest civil rights
marches in the United States since the 1960s peak of the movement.
   In January 1988, Barrett and a small group of demonstrators were
pelted with rocks, bricks and cement during a protest march through
downtown Atlanta.

<HEAD>Solidarity Leaders Wonder if Gdansk Shipyard Can Be Saved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their American backer's role now in
question, Solidarity leaders wonder if anything can save the
rough-and-tumble shipyard where Eastern Europe's revolution began a
decade ago.
   In spite of a rare sunny stretch for selling ships, the
century-old Gdansk Shipyard faces collapse, a victim of the system
its workers sought to change and the upheaval they unleashed.
   ``What happens next?'' reflected Zbigniew Lis, the union's
delegate at the yard, echoing a reporter's question. ``That's what
we'd like to know. This is an hourglass, and the last grains are
dropping.''
   Negotiations suddenly cooled with Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the
Polish-born heiress who last May said she would spend up to $100
million to take the enterprise out of the red.
   She emerged with Lech Walesa from a church in Gdansk and pledged
to buy a 55 percent interest.
   Walesa, in an interview last week, eluded questions on what went
wrong. But Lis made no effort to mask bitterness at a proposal
which, he said, ``turns her generous offer into a Trojan Horse.''
   An aide to Mrs. Johnson said she still wanted to invest in the
shipyard, despite reports the deal had unraveled.
   ``Mrs. Johnson is still very interested and enthusiastic about
the shipyard,'' John Peach, her assistant, said by telephone from
Princeton, N.J. He said the group of advisers Mrs. Johnson
assembled to work on the deal remains intact. ``We plan to be over
there as soon as the government says `Come on over.'''
   According to Solidarity and shipyard officials, Mrs. Johnson
wanted a guarantee that there would be no strikes for five years
along with a five-year wage contract of 50 cents an hour.
   Zbigniew Lis, a Solidarity representative, was quoted in the
youth daily Sztandar Mlodych on Jan. 8 as saying other joint
ventures pay about $1 to $1.50 per hour.
   Also, they said, Mrs. Johnson wanted to halve the work force to
about 3,700 men, limiting production to 10 ships a year, a third of
capacity.
   ``We are not interested in running at our lowest level in 45
years,'' said Hans Szye, operations director. ``We want to build it
up. In 29 years in this business, I've never seen a better world
market.''
   Experts agree. Many European shipbuilders closed down in recent
years, faced with Asian competition, and aging vessels must be
replaced. Specialized ships are in growing demand.
   But ships take two to three years to build, and credit is
essential. Polish banks charge 58 percent a month interest, Szye
said, and foreign banks recoil in fear.
   In October 1988, Communist authorities said they would close the
yard for economic reasons, throwing its already troubled affairs
into turmoil. Violent reaction helped to topple the government.
   More recently, a Solidarity-based government decided to offer
the company to shareholders, as soon as enabling laws are passed.
Meantime, authorities are looking for foreigners with capital.
   Although Walesa said four or five investors are interested, Szye
said the only serious candidate after Mrs. Johnson is Vulkan of
Bremen, West Germany.
   And that raises another problem. For centuries, Poles and
Germans have fought bitterly over the Gothic glories of Gdansk, or
Danzig, a historic port on the Baltic.
   ``We would like to see Vulkan participate, and we would like to
cooperate,'' Lis said. ``But German ownership? I don't think so.
This is a very delicate matter.''
   Lis said that although Solidarity wanted the government to
advance some capital, he had few expectations. ``The government has
a lot of good will but no money.''
   On Mrs. Johnson, he said, ``I think the intention diverged from
the possibility, and we did not get the help she was talking about
all over the world.''
   Whoever steps in, if anyone, all parties agree there is no time
to lose.
   In 1975, as the Lenin Shipyard, the 320-acre complex turned out
32 ships, with a total deadweight of 300,000 tons. Last year,
production was seven ships, 70,000 tons in all.
   Repeated strikes since 1980, and Poland's chaotic situation,
have cost business. Each new order requires at least a year of
preparation to design tools and await deliveries.
   At first glance, the shipyard looks a rust-flecked museum to
Socialist central planning, a vast sprawl of half-finished ideas
decorated by faded slogans emblazoned on billboards.
   Its dramatic skyline of giant blue cranes reveals little
movement. In the afternoon, when the lone shift goes home, it is a
neo-industrial Victorian ghost town.
   Work is paralyzed on a giant Soviet factory ship, for processing
fish at sea, until the shipyard's administrative status is made
clear.
   But the slipways and crucial workings remain intact, and
shipbuilding goes on at a pace which engineers say could be easily
enhanced.
   A West German car ferry and a little fleet of Polish and Soviet
trawlers are taking shape. Two freighters and several wood
transports are nearly done.
   ``It's a fine old place,'' said Leon Sobolewski, a yard official
who beamed at a visitor's interest. He mused aloud at the yard's
tall ships, three-masted sailing vessels for the Soviet and Polish
navies. ``There's a lot of life left here.''
   For many Poles, the yard's main attraction is outside of its
front gate, three soaring steel crosses commemorating the 28 people
killed in the 1970 food riots before workers organized.
   Nearby, a glass case displays memorabilia of Solidarity's
triumphs. Someone has quietly removed the color photograph of Mrs.
Johnson.

   Ruth Washington, the newly appointed

involving a drunken driver, police said.
   Washington, 67, was killed when a car crossed the center line
and struck her car head-on about 2:05 a.m., said Sgt. Robert Brown
of the Greenburgh police. Washington was pronounced dead at the

within a few days.

   The space shuttle Columbia
landed in darkness today with a rescued satellite aboard after
overcoming weather and computer problems that extended the mission
to a record of nearly 11 days.
   The shuttle touched down about 1:35 a.m. PST and rolled to a
stop showing no apparent problem from its heavy cargo, which gave
Columbia a landing weight of 228,400 pounds, more than 8,000 pounds
heavier than the previous shuttle record.
   ``Roger, Columbia. Welcome home. An outstanding job,'' said Mike
Baker, capsule communicator. ``You showed us the shuttle at its
best, at deploying and retrieving satellites.
   ``Great way to start the decade,'' he said.
   Before retrieving the scientific satellite, Columbia's crew
deployed a Navy communications satellite.
   Despite Columbia's record weight, ``it was a beautiful
landing,'' with the nose gear touching down gently and no sign of
brake damage on initial inspection, said William B. Lenoir, NASA's
associate administrator for space flight.
   A closer but still preliminary inspection later found that the
brakes heated up more than expected, because of Columbia's heavy
load, and an orbital maneuvering system may need repair, said
shuttle processing manager Larry Ellis.
   The examination also found that the shuttle's heat-shield tiles
sustained eight ``dings'' larger than one inch and 85 smaller than
that, he said. Another tile may need to be replaced, but the
overall tile damage rate is ``a little below average,'' Ellis said,
adding that Columbia ``is in excellent condition.''
   The spacecraft approached Edwards unseen to the human eye, but
revealed itself with a whooshing noise, then suddenly appeared out
of the dark like a ghost, backlit by powerful searchlights
illuminating the runway.
   The shuttle's trademark twin sonic booms woke residents on the
coast in Malibu as the orbiter streaked toward its desert landing
site. About two dozen people called Malibu police.
   ``Some thought it was an earthquake, others said someone was
trying to break in or was on the roof,'' said Los Angeles County
sheriff's Deputy Sheila Smith.
   Shuttle commander Daniel Brandenstein, pilot James Wetherbee and
mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and G. David Low
left the shuttle 2 hours, 5 minutes after landing.
   NASA astronauts usually disembark from shuttles about an hour
after landing. It took them longer this time because they underwent
extended onboard medical exams and took longer to readjust to
gravity after the record-long flight, Lenoir said. Eventually,
missions of up to 16 days are planned.
   ``It looked like all five crewmen were quite healthy,'' he said
during a news conference.
   ``We've been spending time with the docs doing a lot of grunts
and groans,'' Brandenstein said before he and his crew boarded two
jets to to Johnson Space Center in Houston eight hours after
Columbia landed.
   The shuttle's return already delayed a day by poor weather,
Columbia was to have landed at 12:01 a.m. today until a problem
occurred in a computer that served as a backup to four primary
computers aboard the orbiter.
   Mission controllers canceled an 11 p.m. PST Friday deorbit burn
and instead fired the rockets 90 minutes later.
   The new touchdown time extended the mission to 10 days and 21
hours, more than half a day longer than the previous shuttle
duration mark.
   The faulty computer was taken out of service and its duties as
backup were reassigned to one of the other four computers, leaving
three primary computers.
   About 2,000 people came to see the landing although NASA warned
that darkness would conceal Columbia until moments before it
touched down on a concrete runway illuminated by six 800 million
candlepower searchlights.
   The paved strip was preferred to the recently rain-soaked clay
runways on the expansive bed of Rogers Dry Lake.
   The shuttle carried the 11-ton Long Duration Exposure Facility,
an experiment-laden satellite placed in orbit in April 1984 and
originally scheduled to be retrieved by a shuttle 10 months later.
   Subsequent delays and the loss of the shuttle Challenger in 1986
stranded the LDEF for nearly six years, and a decaying orbit
threatened to pull it to a fiery end in March until Columbia's
robot arm snared and stowed it aboard.
   Among the 57 experiments carried by the LDEF were 12.5 million
tomato seeds to be distributed to schools for study of long-term
space effects on growth.
   The structure of LDEF itself is expected to yield valuable
information about space effects on materials which will help in
designing a permanent space station.
   The 12-sided, 30-foot-long LDEF will remain in the cargo bay
until the shuttle arrives back at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The two-day ferry flight atop a jumbo jet is scheduled to begin in
about six days.
   Columbia was launched Jan. 9 and the crew successfully deployed
a Navy communications satellite and performed a variety of
scientific and medical experiments in addition to capturing the
LDEF.
   The shuttle originally was to land at 2:55 a.m. Friday. However,
patchy fog at the Mojave Desert landing site pushed back the
landing a day and lengthened the mission to a record.
   Columbia set the old duration record of 10 days, seven hours, 47
minutes and 24 seconds in late 1983. That flight carried the
Spacelab-1 module, which gave the orbiter the old landing weight
record of 220,000 pounds.

<TEXT>
   The outgoing leader of Yugoslavia's
ruling Communist Party told delegates to a key congress Saturday
that the old model of one-party rule had failed, and he urged them
to support free elections.
   Yugoslavia must embrace market-oriented economic reform, free
expression and political pluralism, party president Milan Pancevski
said, adding that one-party socialism had ``objectively exhausted
its possibilities for development.''
   Hard-liners won the first round in the four-day meeting,
blocking a quick vote on a document that backs free elections and
formation of independent political parties and expresses a
willingness to surrender the Communists' 45-year monopoly on power.
   The debate indicated a deep split within the party between those
backing rapid political change in conjunction with economic reforms
already under way and those reluctant to fully relinquish the
Communists' hold on power.
   Several delegates from the liberal northern republic of Slovenia
urged that the document be adopted as it stands as one of the first
points of the agenda, apparently to show the party's commitment to
reform.
   But hard-liners, mostly from the largest republic of Serbia,
wanted it to be discussed in committee and adopted with other
documents at the end of the congress, leading to speculation it
could be watered down.
   The hard-liners successfully blocked a motion calling for an
immediate vote. Although 780 delegates favored a quick vote and 645
opposed it, the measure failed to win the needed two-thirds
majority.
   Stefan Koresec, who presided over the morning plenary, said the
draft document would be discussed in committee and adopted at the
conclusion of the congress with other resolutions.
   The debate was indicative of ``a deep split within the Yugoslav
Communist Party over the issue of a multi-party system,'' said Joze
Smole, president of Slovenia's Communist-dominated mass
organization Socialist Alliance.
   He told The Associated Press that Slovenian Communists want to
see the declaration be even more explicit on the party
relinquishing power, while the Serbs consider the party should
retain a dominant role.
   Serbian delegate Slobodan Jovanovic said delegates needed more
time to discuss the document because they had been unable to review
it in advance.
   The declaration, published last week in the media, admits that
the one-party system of monopoly ``has pushed us into autocracy and
prevented us from keeping up with the economic, technological,
political and social changes in Europe and the world.''
   The government Friday announced plans to submit to parliament
constitutional amendments that would formally scrap the party's
guaranteed leading role in society, as well as draft legislation
setting forth the legal groundwork for multi-party elections.
   In his opening address to the congress, Pancevski said
Yugoslavia must enact democratic reforms and reform its economy.
   ``This also means the definite abandonment of the single-party
view of political relations. Through the affirmation of new
democratic reforms, we must ensure ... the freedom from any
monopolies on power,'' Pancevski said, according to an advance text
carried by the national news agency Tanjug. A new party chief is to
be elected at the congress.
   ``The building ... of a system that will constantly increase
human rights and freedoms, that will strengthen democracy and that
will ensure the free expression of political pluralism and an
efficient state based on the rule of law'' are imperative to the
country's development, he added.
   The congress, which will also elect a new leadership, was called
four months early in the wake of Yugoslavia's growing political and
economic crisis. The ruling party, embroiled in internal clashes
over how far to go in implementing reform, has stalled on making
changes deemed necessary to overcome the country's problems.
   With spiraling inflation currently at an annual rate of 1,500
percent, a $17 billion foreign debt, dropping living standards and
growing unemployment, traditional ethnic rivalries have resurfaced
in recent years and added to internal tensions.
   Non-aligned Yugoslavia, once considered the most liberal of the
Communist countries in Europe, has lagged behind some Warsaw Pact
countries in recent months on political reform.
   No foreign delegations were invited to the congress, because
delegates wanted the meeting to have a working character.
   Delegates made another break with tradition when they sang the
national anthem at the start of the congress instead of the
Communist anthem, the Internationale.

   The government Saturday announced a ban on
liquor at official gatherings and said it may outlaw liquor on
Royal Jordanian airline flights in response to demands by Islamic
activists in Parliament.
   Islamic fundamentalists won more than 30 of the 80 parliamentary
seats in November's election, and the Koran, Islam's holy book,
forbids liquor consumption.
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran said no liquor would be sold on
flights to Arab and Islamic countries by Royal Jordanian, the
national air carrier. He said a study was being conducted to see
whether a ban on liquor aboard all flights was feasible.
   The airline has agreements with other airlines and ``we cannot
just ban alcohol immediately and disregard the agreements,'' Madran
said.
   But he issued a written order ``to ban serving spirit drinks on
official occasions ... held by ministries, government departments
and institutions and Jordanian embassies abroad.''
   Earlier, Abdul Munem Abu Zant, a Parliament member from the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood party, called for an immediate
ban on alcoholic beverages aboard Royal Jordanian.
   Abu Zant argued that Royal Jordanian should follow the examples
of airlines in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which have stopped serving
liquor.
   ``We have enough drunk people on earth and therefore we do not
need more drugged people in the sky too,'' Abu Zant told Parliament.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army claims its
``disciplined fire'' during the invasion of Panama kept civilian
deaths to a minimum, but the nation's top medical examiner said the
toll was at least 202, and some say it was far higher.
   ``We have no evidence to say there are thousands, but we know
they are not 200,'' said Carmen Miro, a university professor and
member of a church group.
   Some church groups said the number of Panamanian dead could be
as high as 1,000, and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark
suggested it could run as high as 7,000, though there is little
evidence to support the higher figures.
   ``We have asked our people throughout the country to make a
survey. We think it is closer to 1,000 civilian and military, but
nobody knows,'' said Mario Rognoni, a leader of the political
opposition to the new government of President Guillermo Endara.
   The Panama Defense Forces suffered 314 dead as a result of the
Dec. 20 invasion; 23 U.S. troops died, along with three American
civilians.
   Clark said his figure of ``anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 but most
likely 2,000'' had come from people he met during the two days he
spent here early in January, and not from his own investigation.
   Roger Montero, director of the national office of forensic
medicine, said the civilian death toll nationwide came to 202.
   Most of the higher estimates were based on the destruction of
the crowded neighborhood of El Chorrillo, which is next to the
Defense Headquarters building, the main target of the U.S. Army
fire the night of the invasion.
   El Chorrillo, a neighborhood of two- and three-story old wooden
buildings that was home to more than 20,000 people, burned to the
ground during the fire that broke out after the fighting began.
   However, accounts from the night of the invasion indicate that
many residents had fled El Chorrillo soon after the invasion began
and escaped the destruction, so the death toll there was not as
high as originally feared.
   Most artillery and tank fire was directed at the three-story
Defense Forces Headquarters. Sheridan tanks fired from Fort Amador,
several hundred yards away across an arm of Panama Bay, and from a
hill at Quarry Heights, also only a few hundred yards away.
   ``We had enough time to rehearse. This was an extremely
well-executed operation,'' said Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner in an
interview. He said the coordinated attacks had been organized to
avoid loss of civilian life.
   For months before the invasion, U.S. forces, arguing that the
Panama Canal Treaties allow them to move freely on Panamanian
roads, engaged in almost daily maneuvers that included mock
takeovers of towns and installations around Panama.
   In addition to El Chorrillo, civilian deaths also occurred near
the airport, in the San Miguelito neighborhood where paramilitary
groups fought U.S. forces for several days, and at Rio Hato, a
Panamanian military base about 60 miles to the southwest.
   There was practically no shooting involving civilians in
cross-fire throughout the rest of the country, according to U.S.
military sources.
   Catholic priests at an El Chorrillo church told The Associated
Press they estimate that about 20 people died in El Chorrillo, many
in a fire that was set by retreating paramilitary supporters of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``Nearly 10,000 people sought refuge in the church and the
school and old folks' home next to it,'' said the Rev. Jose Castano.
   The Rev. Javier Arteta added that members of the paramilitary
Dignity Battalions ``came out of their homes shooting in every
direction. They wounded a 6-year-old boy. They did not know what to
do.''
   ``The U.S. soldiers never fired in the direction of the
church,'' Arteta said.
   ``It was a night of terror,'' said Maria Salgado, who lost her
home in the battle and ensuing fire. ``We did not know what was
happening.''
   Arteta said that about an hour before the attacks, people heard
explosions in the direction of Fort Amador, about a mile away, and
many fled their homes.
   ``Throughout the morning, Americans used loudspeakers to warn
people to stay away from the area,'' Arteta said.
   ``The Americans did not care about the dead,'' Arteta added.
``Three days later we had to set fire to six bodies.''
   The civilian dead at El Chorrillo were taken to the nearest
Panamanian hospital, Santo Tomas. Dr. Leonardo Diaz told
journalists the first two days that there were never more than 100
bodies in the morgue.
   In Colon, 50 miles northwest of Panama City, there were reports
of at least 20 civilian dead.
   In the days following the invasion there were also reports of
some dead in isolated encounters with U.S. patrols.

<HEAD>Moynihan's Social Security Plan: Democrats Are Scared, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut
the Social Security payroll tax already has Republicans running
scared, but the New Yorker's fellow Democrats aren't exactly
enchanted either.
   With the White House opposing Moynihan, the Bush administration
finds itself opposing a tax cut, an unusual position for the
president who made the phrase ``no new taxes'' famous. But
Democrats are wary of the budgetary repercussions of Moynihan's
idea.
   Some top Democrats _ trying to not sound harshly critical _ have
already publicly raised questions about Moynihan's idea. The
support of other top congressional Democrats is conspicuous by its
absence.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., calls
the proposal ``very attractive,'' but adds, ``I don't think we
ought to add that loss of revenues to the deficit.''
   The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, James Sasser,
D-Tenn., has taken open delight at Republican squirming over
Moynihan's idea, but warns, ``We can't look at it in isolation from
our fiscal condition, and unless we offset the cut our deficit
problem will get even worse.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the plan
``an important proposal'' on Friday but stopped short of endorsing
it. He said he would withhold a decision on whether to support the
plan until he receives studies from his aides on how it would
effect the federal budget shortfall.
   Not heard from at all have been three other major players in any
revenue legislation: House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.; House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; and
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   ``I haven't seen any bandwagon on the Moynihan thing,'' Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Friday.
   Moynihan, considered one of the Senate's experts on Social
Security, has said his plan is aimed at preventing the growing
surpluses the system generates from artificially lowering the
federal deficit. The Social Security system pocketed $50 billion
more last year than it paid out, allowing the government's books to
show a $152 billion shortfall, rather than one reaching $202
billion.
   The New Yorker's proposal also gives the Democrats a tax slash
that helps lower- and middle-class Americans most of all, since the
payroll tax does not apply at all to earnings above $51,300.
Moynihan's plan stands in stark contrast to Bush's coveted
reduction in the capital gains levy rate, a cut that studies show
will be of most benefit to the wealthiest Americans.
   The cut would add $7 billion to this year's already formidable
budget deficit, and $55 billion more to the gap in fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1. That's $62 billion more in just two years in
spending cuts, borrowing, or increases in other federal taxes that
the government would be forced into to compensate for the payroll
cut.
   Even out of a $1.2 trillion budget, the amount of savings to be
found is huge. To provide quick perspective, lawmakers will have to
find about $35 billion in savings this year for the 1991 budget,
and partisan battles over that amount will probably last until
Congress adjourns in the fall.
   So far, just two Democrats have announced support for Moynihan's
measure, which he plans to introduce Tuesday, the day lawmakers
return from their winter recess.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said he would co-sponsor the bill,
saying continued use of Social Security funds to hide the full size
of the federal deficit are ``a gigantic, although unintended, fraud
on the working people of this country.''
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said he would introduce a companion
bill in the House, calling it ``the only way to force an addressing
of the key issue of the deficit.''
   The proposal can't be ignored. Since he announced the plan on
Dec. 29 _ the middle of the winter recess _ it has attracted
mounting attention by the day. It now looms as one of the major
budget issues facing returning lawmakers.
   ``What can we do,'' mused one Democratic aide. ``If we walk away
from it now, someone else will pick it up.''
   Moynihan would cut the 7.65 percent payroll tax _ paid
separately by workers and their employers _ by 0.14 percent
immediately and by 0.96 percent more next January. The levy would
begin to rise again in the year 2015 so the Social Security system
could begin building up a reserve to pay for the 75 million Baby
Boomers who will begin to retire at around that time.

   Thousands of followers of Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh, the guru of free love, flocked to his commune Saturday a
day after his death to celebrated what they consider the release of
the Rajneesh's spirit.
   Rajneesh, 58, died at his commune in the city of Poona on
Friday. The official cause of death was heart failure, but a
statement released by the commune said he died because ``living in
the body had become a hell'' after the Rajneesh's alleged poisoning
in U.S. jails.
   Commune spokesman Swami Chaitanya Kirti said at least 15,000
followers visited the center Saturday and chanted mantras,
meditated and danced.
   ``They celebrated. They came to hear Osho's last words,'' Kirti
said in a telephone interview.
   Since 1988, Rajneesh had gone by the name Osho Rajneesh, having
dropped the honorific ``Bhagwan,'' which means ``god'' in Hindi.
Osho is a Buddhist term that means ``on whom the heavens shower
flowers.''
   The spokesman said the guru's last message, communicated through
his doctor, said he would be always among his followers.
   ``Never speak of me in the past tense,'' Rajneesh said in his
last message, according to Kirti. ``My presence here will be
greater without the presence of my tortured body.''
   Rajneesh was deported from the United States in 1985 after
pleading guilty to two counts of immigration fraud, which alleged
he arranged sham marriages so his followers could remain in the
United States illegally. He often claimed to have been poisoned
while in jail awaiting trial and deportation.
   Rajneesh spent four years in central Oregon, where he set up a
huge commune that became home to thousands of slavish disciples
whose big thrill of the day was seeing the guru drive by and wave
from the windows of one of his 93 Rolls-Royces.
   Rajneesh preached that materialism was good, and his followers
lavished him with riches. The commune eventually collapsed after
both Rajneesh and his personal secretary were arrested.
   His secretary was convicted of a variety of crimes, including
attempted murder, in connection with a plot to take over the Oregon
county in which the commune was located.
   ``In his final message, Osho said that since the days in jail in
Charlotte, North Carolina, his body has been deteriorating,'' said
the statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone.
   ``While he was in Oklahoma County jail, he was poisoned with
heavy metal thallium, they exposed him to radiation in a way that
it will not leave any proof,'' it said.
   ``Osho had said he had kept the pain to himself but living in
the body had become a hell,'' the statement said.
   Rajneesh's death has triggered questions on the fate of his
commune, which has 500 branches across the globe.
   A 15-member group has taken over adminstration, Kirti said.
   ``There are very capable people to take us through,'' he said.
``Nothing has changed and nothing will change.''

<TEXT>
   Following is the text of a nationally televised
speech President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made Saturday on the fighting
in Azerbaijan. The English-language translation was provided by the
official Tass news agency.
   Comrades, we all are witnessing a protracted inter-ethnic
conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We all are seriously
concerned over the fact that the tension that arose there not only
fails to subside, but becomes aggravated from time to time, leading
to serious consequences every time.
   Over the past two years central authorities have sought to act,
for their part, patiently and in thoughtful manner, trying to solve
difficult problems exclusively by peaceful, political means.
   A comradely dialogue, discussions in the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet, the Central Committee of the party, in the government,
through visits by U.S.S.R. People's deputies and repeated meetings
in Moscow with the leadership of the two republics and with
deputies _ all have been used, with the sole aim of achieving
harmony, and restoring good neighborly and simply human relations,
to find a way out of the dead end and, in the final analysis, to
normalize the situation concerning Nagorno-Karabakh.
   By acting in this way, we proceeded from the conviction that
violence, enmity and continuation of the conflict would not result
in anything good but would only poison the atmosphere still further
and lead to still greater loss of life and breed more violence.
   Unfortunately, under these conditions party, local government
and state bodies of the two republics did not show due
responsibility and thoughtfulness and quite often conceded
principled positions under the pressure of nationalist groups.
   This is how it happened lately when sessions of the Supreme
Soviets of Armenia and Azerbaijan took decisions that run counter
to the Soviet Constitution. They not only failed to promote the
normalization of the situation but, on the contrary, aggravated it
and heightened confrontation.
   Neither side listened to the voice of reason conveyed with
particular forcefulness from the rostrum of the second congress of
the U.S.S.R. People's deputies.
   The situation was made use of by anti-social, anti-popular
elements for further stirring up enmity and exacerbation of the
conflict. Armed clashes began, particularly in border areas and in
places where Armenians and Azerbaijanis lived side by side.
   On Jan. 15, this year the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet had to adopt a decree introducing a state of emergency in
the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region and in some other areas of
Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   It would seem, this measure should have stopped violence and
brought to reason extremists and the leaders of popular fronts that
plunged their peoples into an abyss of chaos and suffering.
   But the voice of reason, the voice of the Soviet public and all
peoples of our country was ignored this time also.
   The calls for dialogue, conciliation and tolerance remained
unheeded.
   Moreover, militant national-careerists continued to heat up the
situation, form groups of militants and to blockade roads and
airports. Attacks on servicemen, arms depots and law enforcement
agencies became frequent.
   The events assumed a particularly tragic character in Baku:
rampages, killings, and the driving of innocent people out of their
homes and to beyond the republic.
   Extremist forces' actions in Azerbaijan assumed increasingly
overt anti-state, anti-constitutional and anti-popular character.
   The legitimate authorities were forcibly barred from performing
their functions, and government structures were disrupted in a
number of areas.
   Engineering and technical facilities were destroyed along
hundreds of kilometers of the state border. The aim of a forcible
seizure of power in the republic was not practically concealed.
   It could no longer continue so. Along with deep compassion for
the innocent victims, wrath and indignation at criminal actions,
facts of brutal violence, vandalism and the violation of laws have
mounted in the country.
   Soviet people demanded from the country's leadership resolute
measures to restore law and order, to ensure safety for people.
   You already know that the decree of the Presidium of the
U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has imposed a state of emergency in Baku,
that units of the Interior Ministry and the Soviet army have moved
into the city.
   They occupied key objects and took under control government
buildings. Resolute measures are taken against ransackers,
organizers and instigators of disturbances. Fire arms and
ammunition are seized from criminal elements.
   To our deep regret there are victims. Military units were met by
fire from terrorists in some places and had to use weapons in
response.
   Grief came today into some houses. I convey to these families my
most sincere condolences.
   The tragic events in Baku, the border areas of Azerbaijan and
Armenia, other regions of the Caucasus have laid bare the price of
nationalist rampage, speculation on sacred national feelings. It is
a crime to push people to blind enmity, to the madness of
fratricidal war.
   The state is duty-bound to put an end to lawlessness and
inhumanity, to resolutely curb criminal actions of extremists, who
have lost human face, who are prepared to take other people's lives
for the sake of personal ambitions, selfish interests and power.
   The state is duty-bound to return peace and security to people
and the possibility to develop in a free and democratic way, to
work normally, live peacefully, to raise and upbring children to
the peoples of the two republics.
   Soldiers and officers of the Soviet army and interior troops are
fulfilling their duty in defending the U.S.S.R. Constitution and
law.
   The leadership hopes that the measures will be understood and
supported by all peoples of our country.
   At this hour I call on all citizens of Azerbaijan and Armenia to
show wisdom and common sense, not to give in to provocative slogans
and actions. I call on all those who have been deceived and misled
or forcibly drawn into criminal actions to come to their senses and
to stop.
   I ask all of you to render every assistance in restoring civil
peace, in jointly overcoming the trial that befell our lot.
   I deeply believe that common sense and responsibility would
triumph, would gain the upper hand.
   Today as never before we need national accord, close cooperation
and assistance to each other in the name of better life for all
peoples of our state.

<HEAD>New East-West Cooperation on Air Pollution Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pollution has never respected frontiers, but
there's something new in the air when a member of a Soviet
delegation pleads with Americans to help block a new dam that would
damage a wilderness valley in Siberia.
   ``The vocal support of environmentalists from around the world
is critical to our efforts to save the valley,'' said Maria
Cherkasova, secretary of the Socio-Ecological Union, one of the
Soviets' largest private environmentalist groups.
   She was a private citizen among the Soviet officials at a
meeting in Washington last week of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee
on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Protection. She called
for a campaign of letters to President Mikhail Gorbachev and other
Soviet leaders on behalf of the Katun valley near the Chinese
border.
   Pollution _ domestic and international _ is expected to be a
lively issue in Washington in the next few months. This week the
Senate takes up a clean air bill that originated with the Bush
administration. A similar bill is working its way through the House
and agreement this year is widely expected, though Bush has
threatened to veto it if changes in Congress make it cost too much.
   Ms. Cherkasova's plea was cited by Worldwatch Institute as
evidence of new East-West cooperation on the environment. The
institute, a non-profit advocacy group, found other examples:
   _ The Soviet government is already getting advice on more
efficient use of energy, which also means less pollution, from the
Natural Resources Defense Council in New York and the Rocky
Mountain Institute in Colorado.
   _ Congress has decided to allocate a symbolic $40 million to
help the environment in Poland and Hungary
   _ Volkswagen of West Germany will join with East Germans to make
a new, less polluting ``Super-Trabbi'' to be sold in both
countries. The Trabant (Satellite) _ familiarly known as the Trabbi
_ has been the only readily available car in East Germany. The need
for something else struck West Germans sharply as more and more of
them began to appear on their beloved autobahns, driven by East
Germans and spewing thick streams of black from their two-stroke
engines.
   _ Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden will set up an
investment company for joint environmental ventures in eastern
Europe.
   Hilary F. French, author of an article to appear in the
March-April edition of ``Worldwatch Magazine,'' also found some
cause for concern in the prospect of new relations between East and
West. She said environmentalists are worried that the rush to help
Eastern Europe's economy could lead to disasters.
   ``Even in the environmental area, `technology transfer' could do
more harm than good if it is simply a way for western companies to
find new markets,'' she wrote.
   She suggested that western companies could try to sell obsolete
equipment and emphasize what she called ``technological band-aids''
rather than root out pollution at the source, as she urges.
   In a longer study, called ``Clearing the Air: A Global Agenda,''
she pointed out that pollution comes from both East and West.
Norway, for example, ``imports'' 96 percent of the sulfur that
falls on its soil _ most of it presumably from the East. But it
also ``exports'' 76 percent of its own emissions.
   In the early 1980s, the latest period for which French has
figures, Milan, Italy, had the highest annual average of sulfur in
its atmosphere. Shenyang _ the old Manchurian city of Mukden _ was
second. Shenyang also had more days in the year when the quantity
was above the standard considered dangerous: 146 days compared with
66 days for Milan.
   She quoted the Natural Resources Defense Council as saying that
New York violated the federal standard for ozone on 34 days a year,
two or three times a week all summer. In Los Angeles it was 172
days a year, almost every other day. She added that counties in
which more than half of all Americans live are out of compliance
with ozone standards.

   A journalist who has been an outspoken
critic of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun was seized by gunmen
Saturday and held more than eight hours before being released. Aoun
was accused of planning the abduction.
   The reporter, George Hajj, refused to talk to reporters after he
was set free at about 2:30 p.m. A relative who did not want to be
identified said he was not hurt.
   Aoun's soldiers and Syrian troops skirmished with machine guns,
tank cannons and mortars in north Lebanon, interrupting traffic
along the highway connecting north Lebanon and the Christian
enclave.
   Police said no casualties were reported. But Aoun's command
claimed in a communique that one Syrian soldier was killed, three
were wounded and two Syrian tanks destroyed by Lebanese army fire.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Aoun's claim could not be verified. It was not
known who started the fighting.
   Hajj was dragged from his apartment in the Christian enclave at
about 6 a.m., according to his mother, Mrs. Badr Hajj. Mrs. Hajj
told The Associated Press that ``gunmen knocked on the door early
in the morning. George opened and they took him.''
   ``They didn't talk much. They dragged him out,'' Mrs Hajj said,
her voice choking with emotion.
   Hajj, 55, works for the daily Al-Bayrak, a newspaper that Aoun
closed last week as part of his attempt to muzzle dissent in the
media. He also is a member of the reporters' syndicate executive
board, which has come under verbal attack from Aoun.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio and the leftist Voice of
the People, which operate from west Beirut, accused Aoun of
arranging Hajj's abduction.
   ``Colleague Hajj's abduction is the latest move in Aoun's war
against freedom of the press,'' said Voice of the Nation, which
interrupted its regular broadcast to report on the incident.
   Hours after the abduction, about 1,000 people, including
journalists, poets and politicians, marched in Moslem west Beirut
to protest Aoun's crackdown on the media.
   The general has ordered media not to refer to Elias Hrawi as
Lebanon's president, or to Salim Hoss as the nation's prime
minister. Aoun opposed the peace plan that cleared the way for
their elections, and he considers himself the legitimate head of
state.
   ``The civil war did not break our pens and Aoun will not be able
to break our pens,'' the Voice of the Nation announcer said.
   Since Aoun issued his media directive Tuesday, he has suspended
operations of the Al-Bayrak and Ad-Diyar newspapers, and the Akhbar
Al-Yom newsletter, for defying it.
   Al-Massirah, the newspaper of the Lebanese Forces right-wing
Christian militia, said it was not publishing Saturday to protest
Aoun's measures.
   The nation's most prestigious daily paper, An-Nahar, has not
been publishing since Tuesday to avoid either accepting the
directive or defying it.
   Radio stations have observed a newscast strike to protest Aoun's
move.
   Aoun opposed the peace plan because it did not include a
deadline for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops, who were
deployed in Lebanon in 1976 to quell civil war fighting.
   Aoun said the Syrians violated the peacekeeping mandate by
siding with the Moslems in the war.

   A century ago this week, Irish
immigrants stood with British, blacks stood with whites, and rival
work gangs stood together for the first time in an Ohio meeting
hall to unite coal miners across the East.
   The United Mine Workers of America union was born 100 years ago
Thursday.
   ``One of our proudest traditions is our solidarity and our
unity, the willingness of our membership to fight and stay
together,'' said UMW President Richard Trumka.
   The modern-day UMW faces plummeting membership in the face of
mechanization and has taken steps to ensure its survival. In recent
months the union has had informal discussions with the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers union to affiliate with it, an idea
that already fell through once, in 1988.
   It reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO last year, and during the 1980s
altered its constitution to allow it to represent non-miners such
as machine shop workers. Its membership now stands at about
150,000, including about 100,000 miners; at its peak in the 1940s,
there were nearly 600,000 miners on the rolls.
   ``The biggest challenge is keeping our members working and
keeping our safety standards intact,'' said Joy Huitt, UMW
secretary-treasurer from Price, Utah, who in 1986 became the first
woman elected to a UMW national office.
   The Mine Workers union was formed from the National Trades
Assembly and the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers,
organizations that fought as often with fists as with words.
   Their fighting legacy has carried over to the union's battles
with coal mine operators, armed security guards and the federal
government. There were battles within the union as well.
   Violent organization battles raged in the coal fields from the
union's inception until the 1920s. Often, organizing miners were
killed by company guards seeking to put down dissent. Sometimes the
guards were killed.
   Sixteen people were killed in a 1912 Paint Creek organizing
battle. Ten people were killed eight years later in the Matewan
Massacre, a tragedy revived in the 1987 film ``Matewan.'' During
the 1920s Battle of Blair Mountain, federal troops moved in to
quell a labor march to Logan.
   ``I went to work before we got the union in here and remember
the battles and the shootings,'' said Porter Cotton, 78, of
Chesapeake in Kanawha County.
   Cotton started work as a trapdoor operator at age 13, before the
union sought a minimum age for mine workers. In the early days,
coal companies controlled their workers' lives, forcing them to
shop in company stores, see company doctors and live in company
houses.
   John L. Lewis became UMW president shortly after World War I and
stayed in charge into the 1960s. He won health and pension benefits
and shorter work weeks for union members but nearly tore the UMW
apart with his tyrannical rule and manipulation of votes and
conventions, said Ron Lewis, a historian at West Virginia
University who is no relation to the labor leader.
   ``Lewis nearly destroyed the union in 1929,'' Ron Lewis said.
``Lewis purged all his enemies ... throwing out his best
organizers.''
   Membership dropped from 650,000 in the early 1920s to about
20,000 in 1929, in part because of Lewis' purge but also because of
a depression in the coal fields due to excessive production, the
historian said. Membership rebounded during the 1930s and '40s.
   Lewis' reach extended to other industries. He helped found the
Congress of Industrial Organizations and pound out labor agreements
in the steel and auto industries, and his union helped create the
United Steelworkers of America union in 1942.
   ``He was a man of vision, without a doubt probably the greatest
labor leader,'' Trumka said. ``Look at what he did with the health
funds and the vision he created for the union of bringing health
care within 25 miles of every one of our members and then setting
up a system of clinics.''
   Three years after Lewis stepped down, W.A. ``Tony'' Boyle tried
to maintain a similar hold on the UMW. Miners grumbled at Boyle's
inability to deliver the same contract gains and backed Joseph
``Jock'' Yablonski for president.
   Boyle tried to steal the 1969 election, but a federal judge
questioned the results and ordered new balloting. Before it could
be held, however, Yablonski, his wife and daughter were murdered in
their Pennsylvania home. Boyle was convicted of ordering their
deaths.
   The deaths brought the union's darkest days.
   ``There are moments in our history that I would like to change,
but I don't know if I'd like to get rid of them,'' Trumka said.
``You have to look at your mistakes and you have to remember them.''
   He said the union also must learn from the history of deaths in
the coal fields, including the shooting death on a West Virginia
picket line last week, and the half-million cases of black lung
disease.
   Trumka expresses optimism that total union membership in the
United States will expand in the 1990s as workers recognize what he
calls an anti-labor sentiment in the country.
   ``I think you will see workers standing up, walking out and
banding together in the streets to demand that will happen,''
Trumka said. ``There will be one group of people who will be
proudly in front in that movement and that's going to be the United
Mine Workers.''

   Johnson, of ``Miami Vice'' fame, was at Port Canaveral on Friday
to test-drive his new racing boat.
   He and Russell, known for such film roles as ``Tango &amp; Cash''
and ``Overboard,'' had lunch with seven others at Captain Ed's
Seafood Restaurant.
   ``They were all very nice, very quiet,'' said waitress Pat
McSparin, who served Johnson a chicken plate and the others chicken

   ``I just want to say Don Johnson's a terrific tipper,'' she said.

   A 22-room mansion owned by John Lennon
and Yoko Ono and once rented by Hustler magazine publisher Larry
Flynt has been sold for $4.31 million.
   Alan Curtis, 52, a sales manager for Dillion Read &amp; Co. of New
York, bought the oceanfront mansion, El Salano. He said the
celebrity ties did not influence his decision to buy the property.
   ``I am looking to retire soon, and South Florida is where I want
to live,'' said Curtis, who also owns a house in Boca Raton.
   The two-story mansion, built in 1919, was bought for $750,000 by
Lennon and Ono in 1980, shortly before the former Beatle was slain
in New York City. Ono spent $3 million restoring it.
   The house, which features a guest apartment and two swimming
pools, was once leased for $10,000 a month to a real estate company
operated by Flynt, the company said. It also has 7{ bathrooms, a
fountain and a stretch of private beach.

   Donald Trump, the millionaire from Queens, is
being wooed westward.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is petitioning the New York real
estate mogul to bring his brand of redevelopment here, couching the
welcome with hints about social responsibility.
   In a letter to Trump, Bradley wrote that Los Angeles ``continues
to provide unprecedented economic opportunities.''
   Trump announced earlier this month that he bought an interest in
Wilshire Center Properties, owner of the 23.5-acre Ambassador
Hotel. The Ambassador property is the site of the now-closed
Cocoanut Grove nightclub, once a haven for Hollywood screen legends.
   He promised a massive commercial, office, residential and hotel
complex on the site, which was coveted by the Los Angeles Unified
School District for a badly needed new midcity high school.
   In the letter, Bradley urged Trump to work with local community
leaders and said any development in the city's more affluent areas
should be matched with projects in poorer neighborhoods.
   Norma Foerderer, an executive assistant to Trump, said that the
letter was being reviewed and she had no immediate response.

   Newspaper publisher Darrow ``Duke'' Tully
pleaded innocent to shooting a neighbor's dog in the head with a
pellet gun.
   Tully, 57, editor and publisher of the Ojai Valley News and
former publisher of the Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette,
was ordered Friday to return for trial March 2.
   He is accused of shooting the dog after it got loose on Oct. 24.
The dog survived with a pellet imbedded in its head. Charges were
filed after the Ventura County Humane Society complained to
authorities.
   The publisher could be sentenced to up to six months in jail if
convicted of the misdemeanor cruelty to animals charge.
   Tully resigned in 1985 as publisher of the Phoenix newspapers,
Arizona's largest, after admitting that he had fabricated a heroic
military record that included service in Korea and Vietnam.

   The Navy, reversing its forgiving approach to
recruits who test positive for marijuana use, has decided that they
will be barred from entering the service.
   ``You test positive for marijuana use _ you're gone,'' said Vice
Adm. J. Michael Boorda, the Navy's chief of personnel, in an
interview on Friday.
   ``It's an important twist'' and shows an increasing lack of
tolerance for drug use in the military, Boorda said. ``We don't
want to lose the battle against drugs.''
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of naval operations, sent
the anti-drug message to his recruiting commanders earlier this
month.
   The new policy will go into effect Feb. 1.
   Previously, the Navy has given a second chance to recruits who
tested positive for marijuana use in boot camp. They were allowed
to enter the service but only if their periodic drug tests showed
they no longer used drugs.
   The policy was designed to give recruits who might not have
known better a chance to change.
   At the same time, the Navy barred recruits who tested positive
for cocaine and other hard drugs.
   Acting on the orders of Congress, all the services began testing
recruits and officer candidates for drug and alcohol abuse in 1988.
   The Air Force allows recruits to admit to marijuana use, but
once they are signed up they must quit using any drugs, said Maj.
Lou Figueroa, a spokesman. Afterward, those who are discovered or
admit to drug use are released from the service, he said.
   Army spokeswoman Paige Eversol said Army policy allows anyone
who tests positive for marijuana to try again six months later to
enter the service. If they test positive for cocaine, they must
wait a full year before reapplying.
   In his message, Trost said he was taking the step ``to improve
force quality.''
   Boorda said the Navy found those who tested positive in boot
camp more prone to return to drug use and less likely to complete
their four-year enlistments.
   ``If a person is not able to stop using drugs for 30 days before
joining the Navy, they didn't want to be in the Navy in the first
place ... and we'll accommodate them,'' he said.
   The admiral, who drafted the policy for Trost, said exceptions
will be allowed, but only for ``the most exceptionally deserving
cases.'' The waivers must be approved by Boorda or his deputy and
the cases are ``anticipated to be small in number,'' Trost's
message said.
   While the move allows the Navy to be more selective about its
personnel, it is also a decision that has impact on the service's
ever-tightening budget.
   About 2,000 sailors tested positive for marijuana use during the
past fiscal year of 1989 out of some 95,000 recruits, said a
personnel officer who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   He said it costs $3,000 to put a sailor through boot camp and
that the Navy could save money if it could ensure that those who do
make it through remain in the service _ and maybe even reenlist.
   ``We're tightening the screws. We're serious about this,'' he
said. ``Every time we can keep a kid who is productive, who has
gone through advanced training, who doesn't have to get new
uniforms _ that saves money. But if you keep a kid who turns out to
be trouble, it's just not cost effective.''
   ``Every dollar that we save, we can put into programs to improve
the quality of life for those people who want to serve,'' he said.

   Myles Horton laughed when authorities
padlocked his civil rights center 30 years ago. ``You can padlock a
building,'' he said, ``but you can't padlock an idea.''
   Horton, who survived attacks by the Ku Klux Klan and
McCarthyites, died Friday at age 84. He had slipped into a coma
Jan. 13 after a 2{-year battle with cancer.
   His Highlander Folk School, one of the most influential training
grounds in the U.S. labor and civil rights movements, was derided
by his opponents as a ``finishing school for communists.'' Its
adherents were called ``a cancerous growth'' spreading throughout
the South.
   The state of Tennessee raided and padlocked Highlander in 1959,
alleging it had violated its charter and illegally sold beer.
   Those rushing to the school's defense included Martin Luther
King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Andrew Young, Pete Seeger, Rosa Parks
and Ralph David Abernathy.
   The school lives on today in the rolling foothills 20 miles east
of Knoxville as th``Kighlander Research and Education Center,
serving as a network for activists in battles over the environment,
racism, poverty and illiteracy.
   Battles are nothing new to the school's students.
   ``The Long Haul,'' an autobiography written with Judith and
Herbert Kohl and soon to be published by Doubleday, relates
Horton's role in the 1930s, when Highlander provided training for
the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the CIO, and supported
coal miners, textile workers and farmers.
   Highlander and Horton served as a bridge between the labor and
civil rights movements, Herbert Kohl said. Rosa Parks, for example,
had been to Highlander two months before she sparked the 1955,
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott.
   In the book, Horton describes himself as a catalyst for social
change:
   ``If you want to change people's ideas, you shouldn't try to
convince them intellectually. What you need to do is get them into
a situation where they'll have to act on ideas, not just argue
about them.''
   Perhaps the best illustration of the philosophy was the
Citizenship Schools project launched by Highlander in 1956 on South
Carolina's Sea Islands. Septima Clark, an activist and close friend
of Horton's who helped organize it, said it taught 100,000 poor
Southern blacks to read and write _ and vote.
   The schools encouraged emerging leaders to form community groups
that became the backbone of the civil rights movement.
   Highlander now is adapting the concept to the environmental
movement. Last year, 400 people from more than 40 states and five
other countries took part in a Xrqgram called ``STP,'' or Stop the
Pollution. STP schools this year will be held throughout the
country to reach fledgling groups.
   The son of a sharecropper, Horton grew up in Savannah, Tenn.,
and felt a moral obligation to act against injustice. ``He is
someone who ... always took responsibility for what is happening in
the world,'' Kohl said.
   Horton attended Cumberland University in Tennessee and studied
under theologian Reinhold Neibuhr at Union Theological Seminary in
New York before moving to the University of Chicago. After a year
in Europe, he returned to Grundy County, Tenn., to help establish
Highlander Folk School in 1932.
   The school blended seminars on politics and economics with
square dances and tales of local history. The civil rights anthem,
``We Shall Overcome,'' was adapted from a black hymnal by Horton's
first wife, Zilphia Johnson Horton.
   Highlander was investigated by a Senate internal security
subcommittee in 1954 for its alleged ties to the Communist Party,
which Horton denied.
   While under investigation by a Tennessee legislative committee
five years later, the school was raided and staffers arrested on
charges of public drunkeness and possession of liquor. One witness
testified Highlander was ``an integrated whorehouse.''
   It was ordered closed that year for violating its charter and
selling beer without a license. Horton said guests and staff would
take beer from a cooler and leave a few coins behind to cover its
cost.
   The state auctioned the Highlander Folk School but it reformed
under its present name and moved to a black neighborhood in
Knoxville. In 1971, it moved to its present location.
   One year later, Horton retired as director but continued working
and studying adult education movemgus in New Zealand, South
Africa, India, Nicaragua and Europe.
   In 1983, Andrew Young and U.S. Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.,
nominated Highlander for a Nobel Peace prize.
   Funeral services were set for Sunday afternoon in Monteagle,
where the Highlander school used to be located.

   Roseanne Barr, television's caustic
television mom, married comedian Tom Arnold on Saturday, four days
after her divorce from her first husband became final.
   ``For the first 4he in our lives, we feel truly happy and are
both eager to learn and enjoy living our lives day to day,'' the
couple said in a statement released by publicist Alana Rothstein.
   No information was released about the second marriage of the
``Roseanne'' television star. Life magazine has exclusive story
rights, Rothstein said.
   The ceremony and reception at Miss Barr's home was a private
affair attended by 40 close friends, relatives and cast members,
Rothstein said. She refused to identify any of guests or give
details about the ceremony.
   Miss Barr called off the wedding last month because of Arnold's
drug abuse. He has since been released from a drug rehabilitation
facility.
   Arnold, Miss Barr's longtime companion and collaborator, showed
some of the World Series opening-game audience at Candlestick Park
how much he cared for Miss Barr by baring his bottom, revealing a
``Rosie'' tattoo.
   The feisty ABC-TV star, a former cocktail waitress, returned the
favor by showing a matching buttocks tattoo that read ``Tom.''
   Miss Barr divorced Bill Pentland, her husband of 16 years,
citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became final
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Argentina and Britain resumed
direct air links Saturday for the first time since the 1982
Falkland Islands War, the latest in a series of moves to
re-establish their historically strong ties.
   An Aerolineas Argentinas flight took off from Buenos Aires
Saturday evening, and a British Airways jetliner left London 2{
hours later en route to this South American capital. Both were to
arrive Sunday.
   ``We're planning a little celebration'' for the arriving British
airliner, said Ian Gillespie, regional manager for British Airways.
``Six pipers from the Buenos Aires St. Andrews Society of the River
Plate will pipe the passengers off.''
   The two countries severed relations after Argentina invaded the
South Atlantic islands, claiming it inherited the archipelago from
Spain upon declaring independence in 1810.
   Britain counterattacked and recovered the sparsely populated
territory of sheepherders and fishermen, which it has ruled since
1833.
   The issue of sovereignty blocked talks for years. Since taking
office in July, President Carlos Menem backed improved ties with
Britain and temporarily set aside _ without giving up Argentina's
claim _ the issue of ownership.
   Trade and travel restrictions were lifted 9nOctober. Interest
sections were upgraded to consulates last month. Shipping ties
resumed earlier this month.
   Talks set for February in Madrid will mark ``a decisive stage
toward renewing diplomatic relations between Great Britain and
Argentina,'' Menem said last week.
   Britain was once one of Argentina's main trading partners, with
substantial landholdings and interests in the South American
county's meatpacking industry.
   By resuming direct flights, Aerolineas' Britain-bound flights
will continue to London from Madrid, where passengers had been
dropped off and picked up by British Airways.
   British Airways' Argentina-bound flights will continue to Buenos
Aires from Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo, Brazil, where passengers
had been dropped off an4 Licked up by Aerolineas.
   Nonstop direct flights will be possible when Boeing 747-400s are
brought into service, Gillespie said. He said about 25,000
passengers fly the route each year.

   A storm spread snow and freezing rain from Nebraska to Michigan
on Saturday after dumping heavy snow on the Great Plains. Snow,
freezing rain or rain fell over much of the East, triggering
flash-flood watches in several states.
   The storm, which began Friday, left up to 14 inches of snow in
Nebraska, as much as a foot in Kansas and up to 6 inches in South
Dakota.
   The University of Nebraska-Omaha canceled all Saturday classes,
and closed its library and recreational facilities during the
morning, said university spokesman Tim Fitzgerald.
   Advisories warning of snow, blowing snow, freezing drizzle or
sleet were in effect in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Illinois.
   Snow and freezing rain also fell from the lower Great Lakes
region to southern New England.
   Winter weather advisories were in effect in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   Rain prevailed from the Middle Atlantic States and the Ohio
Valley to the lower Mississippi Valley, with thunderstorms over the
central Gulf Coast.
   Flash flood watches were issued for southern and central
Mississippi, east central Louisiana, southeastern Kentucky, western
Pennsylvania, and the northern Panhandle of West Virginia.
   In six hours ending at 7 a.m. EST, Cape Girardeau, Mo., received
3.16 inches of rain, Monroe, La., had 2.71 and Evansville, Ind.,

   Heavier rainfall in six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 2.04
inches in Centreville, Ala., and 1.03 in Muscle Shoals, Ala.
   A few snow showers lingered over the Rocky Mountains, and fog
continued to shroud some valleys in Oregon, California and
Washington, but fair weather prevailed across most of the rest of

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ This impoverished country's
military leader has pledged to hand over power in elections this
year, but political and human rights leaders are increasingly
skeptical.
   Rather than moving toward democracy, critics say, Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril's regime is more and more taking on the trappings of
a dictatorship, complete with staged demonstrations of mass support
and intolerance of opposition.
   The government declared a state of siege Saturday night, hours
after police rounded up opposition leaders. It reinstituted powers
to deport Haitians, a move one pro-democracy leader, Jean-Claude
Bajeux, said could be used to throw them out of the country.
   ``The possibility of elections is slim,'' said Joachim Pierre,
general secretary of the centrist Haitian Christian Democratic
Party. ``Even if Avril were sincere, his only support, the
Presidential Guard, is opposed to them.''
   The Presidential Guard is the 1,100-member military unit that
put down an army rebellion last spring that nearly toppled Avril.
   Avril, 51, who took office promising democratic reforms in a
September 1988 soldiers' revolt, has scheduled presidential
elections Oct. 28, with a runoff, if necessary, Nov. 25.
   It would be Haiti's first attempt to hold independently run
elections since Nov. 29, 1987. The vote then was called off after
squads of men in collusion with soldiers shot and hacked to death
at least 34 people at polling stations.
   In many ways, the political climate today, though far less
violent, is reminiscent of the months preceding the Election Day
massacre. At that time, Haiti was under the tyrannical rule of Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy, the man Avril ousted.
   Before the massacre, for instance, loyalists appeared on
government television to urge Namphy to cancel the vote and punish
election organizers for allegedly serving foreign interests.
   Recently, excrement was smeared on the headquarters of an
opposition union and of the Communist Party, along with graffiti
urging Avril to stay in power.
   ``We recognize the authors by their signature. The Duvalierists
governed us for generations, leaving behind them a trail of blood
and excrement,'' said human-rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux. He
referred to the 29-year reign of the late Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc,'' who fled into exile
in February 1986.
   Avril has denounced his opponents as ``alien elements'' who are
``betraying Haiti.''
   Last week, the popular radio satirist Jean-Andre Destin, 33, was
shot to death while walking home from a late-night broadcast.
   There was no proof of government involvement in the killing, but
Dischler Marcelin, general secretary of the Haitian Association of
Journalists, said: ``In past months, journalists have been targeted
by the verbal attacks of the government, and now the attacks have
ended in bloodshed.''
   The state-run media, meanwhile, appear to be promoting an Avril
personality cult similar to Namphy's.
   Like Namphy, Avril has made frequent, highly publicized visits
to provincial barracks and marketplaces to garner popular support,
though he is constitutionally ineligible to run in elections this
year.
   On his televised return from a weeklong state visit to Taiwan,
Avril was greeted by several thousand people, many waving placards
with such slogans as ``If Avril Goes, Haiti Will Be Finished.''
   A reception cortege accompanied the 20-member presidential party
from the airport to the presidential palace, passing through a
triumphal arch erected for the occasion.
   Prominent opposition leader Sylvio Claude accused the government
of staging the reception and of paying people to greet Avril at the
airport.
   Avril has said his was an interim government that would
relinquish power to civilians. He has partially restored the
suspended 1987 constitution and permitted establishment of an
independent Electoral Council to organize and supervise the vote
this year.
   ``The principle of elections should be defended,'' said the
prominent conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray. ``But the
conditions have not yet been created, when you consider Avril's
contradictory statements.''
   Haiti has been ruled by a succession of dictators virtually
since winning independence from France in 1804 after a slave
revolt, and Avril's promise of democracy met with skepticism from
the start.
   Avril himself reinforced doubts in an interview published this
month by the state-run newspaper L'Union. It quoted him as saying
that while Haiti ``is undergoing one of the most severe economic
crises in its history, it is hardly desirable that elections take
place.''
   Unlike the democratic euphoria that preceded the 1987 Election
Day bloodbath, Haitians appear wary of another massacre and have
not shown much enthusiasm for elections.
   Only one group, a coalition of three parties called the Alliance
for Progress and Democracy, has fielded a candidate, prominent
center-right politician Marc Bazin, who was also a front-runner in
1987.
   ``The already bad political climate has worsened after Avril's
spiteful comments about the opposition,'' said Arnold Antonin,
co-leader of the socialist National Progressive Revolutionary
Party, which supports Bazin.
   Even if Avril allows elections, there is no guarantee they will
be fair. Less than two months after the 1987 massacre, Namphy
staged army-run elections, which were widely boycotted by voters
and denounced by most foreign observers as fraudulent.
   Political scientist Leslie Manigat was declared the winner, but
Namphy ousted him in June 1988 after only four months of civilian
government.
   As a former close aide to the Duvalier family, Avril has never
been popular. Both the political right and left have criticized his
economic policies, such as a recent austerity program, as likely to
cause social unrest.
   Avril's credibility has been further damaged by his purge last
year of radical soldiers and his frequent arrests of opposition
leaders.
   In November, the government displayed three radical leaders on
television with their faces badly swollen from apparent beatings.
The three had been jailed on charges of plotting to kill Avril and
blow up the presidential palace. The arrests triggered a general
strike that paralyzed the country for three days.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega helped Fidel Castro
subvert a U.S. trade embargo against Cuba through phony shipping
labels and a free-trade zone in Panama, Senate investigators say.
   The conclusions are contained in the report of a three-year
investigation by the Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism,
narcotics and international communications, headed by Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass.
   The report, issued in December 1988, is receiving renewed
attention in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Panama that ended
Noriega's military rule. The 170-page document on ``Drugs, Law
Enforcement and Foreign Policy'' cited U.S. dealings with Noriega
as ``one of the most serious foreign policy failures for the United
States.''
   According to the report, Cuban seafood and tobacco entered the
United States while U.S. high technology products made their way to
Cuba.
   The report said Noriega used the free-trade zone in Colon to
help Cuban companies in Panama. The zone at the eastern entrance to
the canal was established in 1953 as a center for the duty-free
transshipment of goods.
   The panel relied heavily in that section of the report on the
testimony of former Noriega associate and adviser Jose Blandon. He
told the subcommittee that a firm in Panama, Reciclaje S.A., ``is
used by the Cubans to import high technology to their country, and
they take it from Panama to Cuba.''
   Blandon also said the free zone was used by Cuba to avoid the
U.S. ban on the import of Cuban products.
   ``There is a system set up by the Cuban government and Noriega
allowing Cubans to export shrimp and lobster to the United
States,'' Blandon said.
   He said the shrimp and lobster were harvested by Cuban fishing
boats and brought into the Panamanian port of Vacamonte.
   ``Then they are sent to the United States as if they were shrimp
fished in Panama,'' Blandon said.
   He said the crates containing the Cuban seafood were labeled
``Product of Panama.''
   Panama also harvests shrimp and lobster, Blandon said, adding
that the Cuban catch was included in the Panamanian seafood export
figures.
   He said Panamanian seafood exports had increased, but said that
was because of the addition of the Cuban seafood to the total, not
because the size of the Panamanian fishing fleet had been enlarged.
   Examining other Noriega business interests, the Kerry
subcommittee said Noriega's brother-in-law, Ramon Serio, owned a
company known as Marinac which had been given a monopoly on issuing
identity cards for the officers and crew members manning the 15,000
ships carrying Panamanian registry.
   Blandon testified that sailors paid $80 for each pass while
officers paid $100.
   The subcommittee concluded: ``The identity card business
produces more than $20 million a year.''
   Blandon also testified that Noriega controlled the liquor
concessions at Panamanian airports, the leather export monopoly,
the company controlling the free zone, a television station, a
number of banks, and other businesses.
   The witness said that all of Noriega's enterprises _ legal and
illegal _ produced a huge income and a lifestyle that included a
dozen houses, luxury furnishings, BMW automobiles, vans,
helicopters and executive jets.
   Blandon said Noriega also received some $3 million a year from
the National Bank of Panama.
   ``This is what he calls his petty cash which he carries in his
own briefcase,'' Blandon testified.
   Large amounts of cash were reported to have been discovered when
U.S. troops occupied Noriega's homes and offices last month.

   A group of progressive Communists decided Saturday
that if the party leadership does not accept democratic reforms,
they will split off and form a social democratic party.
   Non-Communist political parties are not yet legal under national
law, but the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia in recent
weeks have dropped their constitutional guarantees of Communist
supremacy and legalized multiparty systems.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev dropped his longstanding
objection to alternative political parties last week, saying it
would be no tragedy if they cropped up in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Communist Party has already suffered one break. The
Lithuanian Communists voted in December to form their own Communist
Party, which favors independence for Lithuania.
   Saturday's decision to threaten a party split came at a meeting
in Moscow of 494 progressive Communists, activist Andrei Koptyaev
said. The majority, led by historian Yuri Afanasiev and economist
Gavriil Popov, leaned toward forming a social democratic party if
their demands for democratic changes are not met, Koptyaev said.
   In that case, the group plans to hold an alternative party
congress, he said.
   A minority led by former Moscow Communist Party boss Boris
Yeltsin preferred to try renovating the party by achieving a
majority in the party leadership, hopefully at the party congress
set for October, Koptyaev said.
   The reformers are principally concerned with the means of
selecting delegates to the full party congress set for October, he
said.
   In the past, the delegates have been chosen from the top,
ensuring continued support for the status quo. Reformers are hoping
for free election of delegates by the party's rank-and-file in the
belief they will force further reforms throughout the Communist
Party.
   In another sign of impending change in the party's structure and
operations, an article in Saturday's Sovietskaya Kultura newspaper
called for the party to give up its powerful bureaucracy and pass
control of society to the Soviet government.
   A brief item on the same page said that a poll found that 56
percent of the respondents favor abolition of Article 6 of the
Soviet Constitution, which guarantees the party the leading role in
all levels of Soviet society.
   However, it also said 54 percent favored a proposal to retain
the Communist Party as the only party in the country, ``in equal
partnership with other elements of the political system.''
   The article did not say who was polled, who conducted it, how
many people were involved or what the percentage of error was.
   An attempt to place the question of abolishing Article 6 on the
agenda of the December session of the Congress of People's Deputies
failed, but the vote of 1,139 to 839 was closer than many had
expected.

   East Germany's Communist Party chief early
Sunday called for ``radical reform and consolidation'' after an
emergency session, indicating a bid to dissolve the embattled party
was unsuccessful.
   The marathon meeting took place Saturday while more pro-reform
rallies drew tens of thousands of people.
   Party leaders met after factions called for dissolution, saying
reforms proceeded too slowly since hard-line leaders were ousted in
October.
   The Communist leader, Gregor Gysi, told the session that demands
to split up ``are irresponsible and endanger the stability of the
German Democratic Republic,'' according to a statement issued by
the leadership.
   After the session ended shortly before midnight Saturday, Gysi
said: ``Radical reform and consolidation are standing further in
the forefront for the Communist Party.
   ``Party leaders decided during the daylong session to use their
powers in the interest of the people and the country and less for
the party,'' Gysi added, according to the brief dispatch from the
official news agency ADN. ``That's designed to counteract the
growing polarization among the people.''
   ADN did not say how may leaders attended or if there was a
formal vote. But Gysi's comments indicated the leaders had not
agreed to dissolve the party.
   About 5,000 doctors and other medical personnel demonstrated for
higher wages and better working conditions in East Berlin,
government television reported.
   In the southern city of Plauen, about 35,000 people took to the
streets against the Communists, while 10,000 farmers rallied in the
city of Neubrandenburg to demand higher prices for their products,
the television reported.
   A conspicuous absentee from the party meeting was vice-chairman
Wolfgang Berghofer, a leading reformer who was quoted Friday as
saying he would abandon the Communists to join the opposition
Social Democrats.
   Berghofer's departure likely would spur others to leave the
party, which is under fire for being too slow to embrace reforms
and relinquish control over many aspects of East German life.
   Desertion from party ranks is already in full swing. Gysi said
the membership had plunged to 1.2 million from nearly 2.3 million
in 1987.
   However, the party still has a grip on much of the nation's
business and political life.
   West German leaders are actively seeking to help pro-democracy
opposition forces and cautiously considering support for smaller,
established parties that are breaking with their decades-long
alliance with the Communists.
   Free elections are scheduled in May, the result of a fall
pro-democracy movement that ousted the hard-line leadership of
Erich Honecker.
   The West German government is convinced that the leadership to
be elected in May will favor German unification, and for weeks it
has been outlining the Bonn view of how the process will work.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday proposed a joint
government commission as part of his overall plan to speed the two
countries toward unity.
   The chancellor unveiled the idea of a joint German-German
government commission during a speech in Bremen.
   He said the commission would handle ``permanent consultations
and political agreements between the two German nations.'' Kohl
said he hopes the panel could be set up shortly after the elections.
   Despite democratic reforms introduced in East Germany since
Honecker's fall in October, thousands of East Germans continue to
leave the country for the West.
   In downtown East Berlin's Alexanderplatz on Saturday, thousands
of shoppers lined up for the chance to buy western groceries at
eastern prices.
   The West Berlin store King's Weekly Market set up a stand and
sold bread, fruit, fish, eggs, beer and other items for East German
marks to raise money for environmental projects in East Germany.

   More than 2,500 police and National Guard troops
brought their guns Saturday to the tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., the apostle of nonviolence, to protect five white
supremacists demonstrating nearby.
   ``The enemy is at the front door. They want us to hide under the
bed,'' shouted Frankie Johnson, a 20-year-old Atlanta woman was
among 75 counterdemonstrators who showed up despite suggestions by
civil rights groups that they ignore the white supremecists.
   Authorities reported no violence at the rally led by
Mississippi-based white supremacist Richard Barrett, which was
condemned in advance by President Bush.
   However, the security arrangements caused the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change to close for the day.
   The demonstration, lasting less than an hour, took place near
the spot where a parade marking the King national holiday began
Monday, across the street from King's gravesite.
   ``That grave is not a throne. That corpse is not a king. We are
here to bury a tyranny,'' the Mississippi-based white supremacist
said.
   The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said four supporters joined
Barrett; a reporter earlier counted three.
   As he left with a law enforcement escort, Barrett was jeered by
some of the counterdemonstrators, a racially mixed and mostly young
group kept at least 200 yards away in the morning fog and drizzle.
   Barrett then went to Forsyth County, a virtually all-white area
an hour to the north, where he drew a crowd of about 15 people at
Cumming's city hall. Ten of the onlookers said they were members of
Ku Klux Klan groups and came to denounce Barrett because he was an
outsider and because of a past dispute in which Barrett had opposed
the use of Klan robes.
   Barrett and one other man then staged a short march in the rain
as 50 state and local officers kept watch.
   Hosea Williams, a city councilman and former King aide, led
about 60 civil rights supporters in two busloads from Atlanta in a
separate march through a quiet suburban area of Forsyth County. The
buses passed about 75 onlookers, some carrying Confederate battle
flags.
   The civil rights group, protected by about 225 local and state
officers, disbanded after a rally at which Williams complained the
county has failed to open sufficient opportunities for blacks since
a huge civil rights march there in 1987.
   Williams said he did not want a confrontation with Barrett, but
he said he was saddened to see King's gravesite made inaccessible
by the protest and police.
   ``Dr. King was the epitome of nonviolence,'' Williams said in
Forsyth County. ``To see his grave surrounded by guns and violence
certainly hurts me.''
   Atlanta police reported two arrests _ one for disorderly conduct
and one for public drunkenness _ in the vicinity of the rally
there. No arrests were reported in Forsyth County.
   The security effort in Atlanta could cost more than $500,000,
Harry Heath of the Georgia Department of Defense estimated.
Officials in Forsyth County said security could cost an additional
$100,000 there. Groups led by both Barrett and Williams have been
pelted with rocks in past marches.
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris objected to the Park Service
decision to allow the white supremacist rally just a week after the
federal holiday honoring King. A Harris aide contacted the White
House twice to ask that the date of the groups permit be pushed
back, said the governor's press secretary, Barbara Morgan.
   ``We thought that was pretty insensitive to issue it at that
time, when there are people here from all over the country, all
over the world,'' she added. ``We think it is rather unthinking and
unfeeling.''
   Jim Howard, a park service spokesman in Atlanta, said there was
no record of the park service being contacted by the White House on
the matter. He said park service officials visited Barrett in
Mississippi but failed to convince him to change his plans.
   Elsewhere Saturday, about a dozen robed Ku Klux Klan members
ambled through downtown Bossier City, La., in a rally that
attracted more police than demonstrators or spectators.
   More than 50 officers, including a SWAT team and horse patrols,
sealed off the government complex. There were about 20 spectators,
many of them reporters, said City Attorney Jimmy Hall.
   The Klan's area leader, Wayne Pierce, said earlier he expected
200 to participate in the march, which he billed as a show of
strength to celebrate the rebirth of the Klan in Louisiana.

<HEAD>Pope Accepts Invitation To Visit Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will visit Czechoslovakia
before June, accepting the invitation of the new non-Communist
government in Prague, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday.
   The announcement comes two days after the Czechoslovak
government said it wanted to re-establish diplomatic relations with
the Vatican, which have been suspended for 40 years.
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said the date of the
visit had not been determined but that it will would take place
before the Czechoslovak elections scheduled for June 8 and last two
or three days. He said the pope generally avoids visiting countries
at the time of an election.
   He said the pope ``had accepted with graditude'' the invitations
from President Vaclav Havel and Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the
Roman Catholic primate of Czechoslovakia.
   A thaw in relations is possible now because a popular revolution
recently ousted Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist leaders,
leading to broad democratic reforms that, among other things,
loosen restrictions on religious freedom.
   The Vatican spokesman said officials would have to find a break
in the pope's schedule which includes a Jan. 25 to Feb. 1 trip to
five African countries, a May 6-14 visit to Mexico and a May 25-27
trip to Malta.
   The Austrian Catholic news service Kathpress, citing
unidentified Vatican sources, reported Friday that the pope would
visit Czechoslovakia on April 21-22. The Rome daily Il Tempo also
said the trip would be made on those dates.
   Navarro said those could be reasonable dates but ``for the
moment there is no precise indication'' on when the pope will
travel to Czechoslovakia.
   John Paul formally accepted the invitations after meeting with
Archbishop Jan Sokol of Trnava, Archbishop Frantisek Vanak of
Olomouc and a Czechoslovak government delegation that included
First Vice President Jan Carnogursky; Vice President Josef Hromadka
and Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier.
   Navarro said the invitation from Tomasek came in the name of the
priests and faithful in the three Czechoslvak regions of Bohemia,
Morovia and Slovakia. He said the papal trip could include a stop
in each of the three regions.

   John Gotti ordered a union leader shot in 1986
to avenge a slap in the face, a prosecutor said as the reputed mob
boss's assault and conspiracy trial got under way Saturday.
   Gotti's attorney said in opening arguments in state court that
the charge was false and that his client was the victim of a
``modern-day vendetta, persecution and witch hunt.''
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky described Gotti,
49, as the ``CEO'' of the Gambino crime family and co-defendant
Anthony Guerrieri, 60, as a Gotti ``soldier.''
   Cherkasky said the defendants arranged with the Westies, a gang
of ``vicious, brutal killers'' from Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, for
the May 7, 1986, shooting of John O'Connor, vice president of a
Carpenters Union local.
   O'Connor, who was shot four times in the buttocks and legs,
survived.
   The prosecutor told the jury that O'Connor, who survived the
attack, was shot because he had sent thugs to trash a restaurant
owned by Gotti associate Phillip ``Philly'' Modica.
   Cherkasky walked to the defense table, stared, pointed and said,
``This man, John Gotti, head of the Gambino crime family, ordered
that assault.''
   Then, pointing at Guerrieri, Cherkasky said, ``This man, Anthony
Lee Guerrieri, assisted in the planning and execution of that
assault.
   ``The evidence will show that John Gotti struck back because he
could not allow a challenge to go unpunished,'' the prosecutor said.
   Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler, said government agents had
followed his client to weddings and bar mitzvahs for 12 years ``and
not once have they seen him commit a crime.''
   ``Mr. Gotti hasn't been convicted of a crime in 15 years,''
Cutler said. ``His friendships are not crimes.''
   Cutler wondered how the state can find money to prosecute Gotti
because of ``who they say he is,'' but is unable to find funds to
house the homeless who huddle against the courthouse each night in
cardboard boxes.
   Cutler said his client, married to the same woman for 30 years
and about to become a grandfather for the fifth time, is ``not an
ogre, not a gangster.''
   The jury is expected to hear several tapes, some of them barely
audible, which prosecutors say link Gotti to the shooting.
   One tape, which acting Justice Edward McLaughlin ruled
admissible as evidence, contains a bugged conversation in which a
voice said to be Gotti's, talking about O'Connor, said someone
would have to ``bust 'im up.''
   Attorneys for both sides say jurors will also hear testimony
from killers, drug addicts, wife-beaters and liars.
   Cherkasky said that although O'Connor was the victim, he would
not be testifying, and dismissed him as corrupt. O'Connor has been
indicted on extortion, perjury and larceny charges in the
restaurant attack.
   The jury has been sequestered, and their names and addresses
have been withheld to lessen the chances of them or their families
being harassed.

<HEAD>Dockworkers' Walkout Idles Port of Baltimore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Port of Baltimore was idled Saturday when
dockworkers went on strike, and managers claimed the walkout could
cause a permanent loss of business to competing ports.
   About 2,000 members of the International Warehousemen's
Association put up picket lines at the port, where 13 ships were
scheduled to call this weekend.
   The strike was was triggered by a dispute between two of the
port's five union locals over allocation of jobs under a tentative
contract agreement that was to have been voted on by the rank and
file on Friday. Economic issues had been settled for the
longshoremen, who are paid $18 an hour.
   Port managers and elected officials warned that a strike of more
than two weeks could prompt shipping companies to take their
business to competing East Coast ports, dealing the city an
economic blow.
   ``That means we're going to lose business, some irretrievably,''
said William J. Detweiler, president of Steamship Trade Association
of Baltimore, an employers' group. ``There'll be no ships coming
here.''
   U.S. Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., said as many as 30,000
people could suffer direct or indirect loss of income because of
the strike.
   ``Unfortunately, so many people are going to be hurt, so many
families,'' Bentley said. ``Efforts to improve Baltimore's name
will be put way back for a long time.''
   Most of the ships due at the port were expected to be diverted
to other harbors. About 2,500 ships call at Baltimore each year,
but the number has been declining as shippers move to competing
ports.
   Baltimore has lost 29 steamship lines in the last five years to
the port of Hampton Roads, Va. Virginia ports have been especially
effective in luring away much of the cargo that moved by rail
between Baltimore and the Midwest.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer has threatened in recent weeks to
take over the port's operations if there was a strike, but he
declined to comment on the walkout Saturday.
   The ILA in Baltimore is alone in the nation in having failed to
reach an agreement on local work rules. Negotiations between the
union and waterfront employers have dragged on since the contract
expired in October.
   The agreement that was to be voted by workers Friday would have
eliminated what management says is one of the port's worst
problems: rules allowing the union to decide when crews stop work
for bad weather.
   But the tentative accord prompted a dispute between two union
locals, one representing clerks and the other cargo handlers. The
pact would have reduced the number of clerks and increased the
number of handlers.
   When the clerks' local complained to Bowers, the New York union
president, he ordered the workers' vote blocked and recommended the
dispute be submitted to a labor-management committee.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion S. Barry, his political career
jeopardized by his arrest on a cocaine possession charge, plans to
enter a substance abuse treatment program, a close adviser to the
mayor said Saturday.
   ``He knows that he needs help, and that he can't deal with it
under the pressure that he now has,'' said the adviser, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   ``There's political wisdom to it, but also there is his personal
condition to think of here.''
   Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said that the mayor will make a
statement on his personal life Sunday, but declined to elaborate.
   WRC-TV reported on Saturday that the mayor will postpone making
any public statements about his political future for at least 30
days.
   Barry, 53, relinquished day-to-day administration of the
government Friday to his top aide just hours after he appeared
before a federal magistrate to answer charges stemming from his
arrest in a downtown hotel Thursday.
   Prosecutors say they have audio and video recordings of the
mayor purchasing and using drugs in the company of a female
acquaintance.
   The aide said he did not know whether Barry would seek treatment
on an in-patient or out-patient basis or whether the treatment
would take place in Washington or another location.
   The aide also said the treatment decision would be considered
independent of other tough choices the mayor now faces, including
whether to resign from office.
   ``Even though everything here is intertwined with the other
problem, treatment must come first,'' said the aide. ``We persuaded
him he needs help, and you can't put a time limit on it, but
solutions to the other issues will evolve later.''
   A Barry cabinet member, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the mayor has at least considered the political ramifications
of entering a treatment program.
   ``That's not to say the mayor is ready to admit he has a
problem,'' said the source. ``He realizes that getting treatment
would be helpful to him if only because it would reduce the
pressures he is under both politically and legally.''
   The issue of drug treatment, Barry's control of the government
and whether the mayor should seek re-election were first raised
during a stormy two-hour meeting Friday between Barry and his top
political advisers.
   Barry tentatively agreed not to run for re-election.
   Barry's decision to enter a treatment program after further
discussions with top aides and advisers late Friday and on
Saturday, aides said.
   One adviser said that Barry has been persuaded of the futility
of running for re-election in a city plagued by drug abuse and
drug-related homicides.
   ``He is resigned to it,'' said one adviser who urged the mayor
to scuttle his re-election effort during a tense two-hour session
on Friday and in a later strategy meeting. ``It is a foregone
conclusion, and the mood in there was like that of an Irish wake.''
   The adviser said he was uncertain when Barry's decision would be
made public.
   Barry's re-election announcement, which had been scheduled for
Sunday, ``was postponed, obviously,'' the aide said.
   ``Maybe that postponement will just go and go and go
indefinitely,'' the aide said.
   Jim Vance, one of a handful of television reporters called to
Barry's home Saturday evening, reported that the mayor is ``not
going to make any decisions about his political life for at least
30 days.''
   The WRC-TV reporter noted that he had known Barry for about 20
years, both personally and professionally, and agreed to the
mayor's request that most of their hour-long conversation be held
confidential.
   However, he said he could report the mayor's plans to delay a
political decision and that Barry planned a statement Sunday
morning on his ``personal life.''
   The Barry adviser, who spoke only on condition that he not be
named, said he is confident that the mayor will honor his pledge to
drop plans for a fourth four-year term in November.
   However, Barry has frequently changed his mind on city issues
without informing his aides.
   ``If he is willing to go back on minor decisions involving the
day to day operations of the government, he could certainly do so
here,'' said a longtime associate of the mayor's. ``But when he has
time to reflect on this, he will realize that there really is no
way he can run again. The decision he apparently reached Friday is
one that eventually he will have to honor, even if he tries first
to go back on it.''
   Even if Barry does not run for re-election, he has not yet
indicated any willingness to resign, the sources said.
   ``We haven't talked about whether he will resign yet,'' said one
adviser who participated in Friday's meeting. ``These things will
all be dealt with, in time, but the immediate concern was making a
change for now.''
   Jeff Gildenhorn, a fund-raiser for the mayor who participated in
Friday's meeting, stopped short of saying Barry had agreed not to
seek re-election.
   However, Gildenhorn said he was confident the mayor ``will do
what is best for him, mentally and physically, and for the city.''
   ``These are very trying times, and we want to direct the mayor
in the right direction,'' Gildenhorn said. ``At this point, we have
suggested that the mayor re-evaluate his position, and ... we want
him to be thinking clearly and lucidly.''
   WRC-TV, citing law enforcement sources, reported that the
cocaine possession charge Barry faces will not be dropped unless
the mayor resigns.
   In an interview on WUSA-TV, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said it
was ``not appropriate'' for him to comment on whether the charges
would be dropped if the mayor resigns.
   But he said he was ``very sensitive to the concerns of this
community, to the people in this community and the need to have an
effective government in place.''
   ``There are a broad range of considerations as United States
attorney that I would consider beyond the simple issue of holding
Mr. Barry accountable for his criminal conduct,'' Stephens said.
   Barry burst into tears when informing his cabinet that City
Administrator Carol B. Thompson would be handling the routine
chores of government, said a cabinet source.
   In a statement released by his office on Friday, Barry suggested
that he will stay involved in the government, saying he would be in
touch with Thompson and other officials several times a day to
monitor how his administration is functioning.
   Barry's departure from the race would open the door for a
mayoral candidacy by Jesse L. Jackson, who moved to the nation's
capital last April and has refused to rule out a bid for the
mayor's chair if Barry is not in the race.
   Jackson told ``NBC Nightly News'' Saturday that he had talked
with Barry, but not about politics. ``My concern at this poinht is
intensely personal,'' said Jackson. ``We will have the time ... to
meet and discuss the legal ramifications and the moves he will make
as to how he was a part of this process.''

   A top military general alleged
Saturday that the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and a State
Department envoy directed Moslem rebels in their attack on the
eastern city of Jalalabad in March.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi, a secretary for military forces, also
claimed that two Pakistani artillery units participated in the
fighting.
   ``The plan to attack Jalalabad was directed under the leadership
of Robert Oakley and Peter Thomsen, with the direct participation
of two artillery military units of the Pakistan armed forces,''
Ulumi told foreign journalists.
   Oakley is the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, and Thomsen is a
State Department envoy.
   Ulumi said there was ``clear evidence'' to support his
allegations, but he did not elaborate.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said, ``It
appears to be an old allegation that had very little currency back
then because it was so preposterous.'' He added that he had no
firsthand knowledge of what the Afgan officer said Saturday ``but
it does sound reminiscent of charges heard earlier and quickly
dismissed.''
   Afghan guerrillas said Saturday they killed 16 government
soldiers, including Gen. Ajab Khan, and destroyed a cargo plane
during heavy fighting around the eastern city of Khost. The
guerrilla report from Islamabad, Pakistan, which could not be
independently confirmed, said the plane was downed Saturday but it
did not say when the 16 soldiers were reportedly killed.
   In his talk with journalists, Ulumi claimed Pakistani troops
dressed in ``Afghan clothes'' fought alongside the guerrillas in
eastern Afghanistan four times in 1989.
   Pakistan has denied its troops ever participated in the
neighboring civil war between the Soviet-backed government and
Moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy warriors.''
   The guerrillas launched an all-out attack on Jalalabad, a
strategic city, on March 6, three weeks after the Soviet Union
withdrew the last of its forces from Afghanistan.
   The city of about 65,000 people is about 40 miles from the
border with Pakistan, where the guerrillas are based, and it would
have given them a major foothold in the country.
   Guerrillas overran a key army garrison outside Jalalabad, but
their drive to capture the city eventually halted under withering
artillery fire and aerial bombing by Communist forces.
   Casualties on both sides were estimated in the thousands. It was
seen as a humiliating defeat for the guerrillas, who have yet to
conquer any major Afghan city.
   Ulumi lashed out at foreign backers of the mujahedeen, who
include the United States.
   ``Still the attacks continue in the frontier provinces of the
country with the support ... of the governments of the United
States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and their allies,'' he said. ``Such
activities can only be called terrorism.''
   Afghanistan's ruling Marxists seized power in a 1978 military
coup that sparked the insurgency. Soviet troops came to their aid
in December 1979.

<HEAD>`Invincible' Mayor Faces Toughest Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, Marion Shepilov Barry Jr., mayor of
the capital since 1979, bragge that he was the fellow who hadn't
been caught, even as so many of his chums and associates, even a
wife, had seen the back side of a cell door.
   He had his vices, he acknowledged. But, as he told The Los
Angeles Times in a memorable barroom interview just a month ago:
``I'm not stupid enough to have done the things they accuse me of.
God gave me a good brain.''
   ``What I have done,'' he repeated, ``nobody knows about, because
I don't get caught.''
   In that same conversation, Marion Barry, 53, had pronounced
himself politically ``invincible.'' And for a few moments Friday,
he seemed just as cocksure when he was led into a federal courtroom
to be arraigned on a misdemeanor count of possession of crack
cocaine, the very drug which is the scourge of the city and has
turned it into the nation's murder capital.
   In customary, regal stride, he headed for the table marked
``defendant'' and, with rock-steady nerves, poured a glass of water
to the brim. He teased a courtroom artist, who was focusing on him
through tiny binoculars, by encircling his own eyes with his
fingers.
   Then the magistrate noted that, if convicted, Marion Barry could
go to jail for a year. Suddenly, the mayor's facial muscles
betrayed him. The cool smile vanished, replaced by clenched teeth.
Perhaps, only then, had reality sunk in.
   Barry, despite dozens of prior stories alleging episodes of drug
abuse, womanizing, mystery trips and inattention to the city's
business, had planned to formally announce on Sunday his candidacy
for a Nokrth term. And with a political machine rivaling that of
the late Richard Daley of Chicago, few would have ruled out his
chances, even against the prospect that Washington's other
pre-eminent black hero, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, was himself eyeing
the office.
   No more. Barry, in tears, late Friday yielded day-to-day control
of city government, which employs one out of every 12 D.C.
residents, to a deputy, Carol B. Thompson, to prepare his defense.
The government's case includes a positive drug test, and video and
audio tape which prosecutors say recorded him buying and smoking
crack in a hotel room occupied by a longtime girlfriend who
cooperated with the FBI. And aides portrayed the mercurial Barry on
Saturday as having accepted the notion that he cannot run again;
the decision now, they said, is whether he should resign.
   A close adviser to Barry said Saturday the mayor planned to
enter a substance abuse treatment program and a local television
station reported decisions about his political future were on hold
for at least 30 days.
   For years, Barry's black supporters, including Jackson, a fellow
lieutenant in Martin Luther King's civil rights crusade, had lined
up behind the mayor when he denied misconduct and swore, time and
again, that he had never used drugs. By his account, such reports
were generated by a venal white media and a Republican
administration eager to reclaim the reins of city government from
the black community.
   But, while Jackson, rarely at a loss for words, held his tongue
over the Mayor's arrest, others felt pushed over the brink.
Especially in the schools, where Barry, like Jackson, routinely
preached against the evils of cocaine, the sense of betrayal
erupted in shouts of pain and despair.
   ``What makes me so mad is that the mayor is black, representing
us, our race,'' declared Anthony Witcher to his high school history
class. ``Doesn't he know the stereotypes someone like me already
faces? This just makes it worse. I just know it will be worse.''
   And this, from junior classmate Terri Dantzler: ``He goes around
telling us not to do drugs, then does them himself. I feel pitiful.
And he should be ashamed.''
   Among community and political allies, the dismay extended to
another question as well. At that was how a man, who so prides
himself on his intelligence, who already was under scrutiny for
prior, unexplained forays into a hotel room occupied by a confessed
drug dealer, have walked into so such a trap?
   ``It raises the Gary Hart question: How can one person be so
stupid?'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, referring to the
former presidential candidate who challenged the media to track his
personal life, then spent time with a woman other than his wife.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said Barry's arrest at a downtown
hotel was ``part of the ongoing investigation of a broad range of
allegations'' against the mayor, dating to the discovery that he
had visited a former D.C. employee, Charles Lewis, in a separate
hotel a year ago.
   Lewis was sentenced Friday to 15 months in prison for conspiracy
to distribute and possess cocaine. He told the court that he had
obtained at least $140 worth of crack for Barry on at least three
occasions, and once believed that he ``should lie and go to jail to
protect the mayor.''
   As an outgrowth of the Lewis investigation, authorities enlisted
the help of Rasheeda Moore, a former model who had been intimate
with the mayor for several years, according to several news reports
which quoted anonymous sources. It was she who lured him to the
FBI's ``sting'' setting on Thursday, the reports said.
   Reports that Barry had used cocaine date to 1981, when police
were tipped that patrons at a nightclub, ``This Is It,'' had seen
him snorting the drug. Police said that report, and others, could
never be corroborated.
   Another female acquaintance of the mayor, Karen Johnson, a
convicted drug dealer, was jailed for eight months for refusing to
testify over whether she sold cocaine to Barry.
   A month before he was elected in 1979, Barry acknowledged to The
Washington Post that he ``used to run around with guys who went to
prison or are dead. I was lucky. I was the one who didn't get
caught ... when we were out shooting dice or something.''
   Since then, a dozen more of his close associates, including his
second wife, Mary Treadwell, and two deputy mayors, have been
jailed over various charges of misconduct as Barry built a city
government unrivaled, on a per capita basis, for its size. And,
just a month ago, Barry was still boasting, this time to a Los
Angeles Times reporter, that no cop had laid a glove on him.
   On Thursday, with a few alleged puffs on a drug pipe, all that
went up in smoke.

   The archbishop of Canterbury said
Saturday the Soviet-backed government agreed on a church-organized
relief plan for an estimated 4 million drought victims in northern
areas where rebels are fighting army troops.
   Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the Anglican Church, told
reporters he hoped the relief operation led by a consortium of
three churches will start soon and that ``no obstructions will be
allowed to block'' it.
   ``Famine must never be used as a weapon of war,'' Runcie added.
   Under the plan, Runcie said a consortium of three churches known
as the Joint Relief Partnership would be allowed by the government
of President Mengistu Haile Mariam to distribute food in the
embattled northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.
   The Joint Relief Partnership consists of the Ethiopian Orthodox
Church, the protestant Mekane Yesus Evangelical Church and the
Ethiopian Catholic Church.
   The archbishop did not say if the agreement between the
government and the consortium has been signed or whether the
churches have been assured of safe passage for relief supplies by
rebel groups in the two provinces.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting a war
of secession in Ethiopia's northernmost province for nearly three
decades. Just to the south, the Tigrean People's Liberation Front
seeks the overthrow of Mengistu.
   Runcie was ending a six-day visit in which he met with Mengistu
and other top government officials and visited Asmara, the
provincial capital of Eritrea, which remains in government hands.
   The United Nations has appealed for 700,000 tons of food and
called for an ``international relief operation of major
proportions'' to avert a repeat of the 1984-85 famine when an
estimated 1 million people died in Ethiopia.

   Federal investigators Saturday
retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage of a corporate
jet that crashed while trying to land in a downpour, killing all
seven people aboard.
   The crash Friday night of the Eastman Kodak jet strewed debris
across Little Rock Regional Airport's main runway, forcing
officials to close the airport and stranding scores of passengers.
   Crews cleared smaller debris from an alternate runway, and air
traffic resumed on a limited basis late Saturday morning, said
airport Manager James Rodgers.
   ``Right now we have a team of investigators out there
documenting the scene, trying to get all the information we
possibly can from the physical evidence,'' said Clint Thorpe, head
of the National Transportation Safety Board team investigating the
crash.
   Officials plan to investigate the possibility that wind shear or
lightning played a role in the accident, Thorpe told an airport
news conference. A thunderstorm was reported in the area at the
time.
   Thorpe said the flight data recorder would be sent to Washington
for analysis and that the device was expected to yield information
in the next three or four days.
   Investigators also will review tapes from the airport tower of
conversations between the jet's crew and air traffic controllers,
and maintenance records on the aircraft were being flown in at the
agency's request, Thorpe said.
   A preliminary report on the crash could be filed with the NTSB
as early as next week, he said.
   Rodgers said operations were normal before the crash despite the
weather. ``The weather was extremely bad on this particular flight,
but it had been deteriorating all day,'' he said.
   The crew was attempting to make an instrument landing during the
storm when the jet hit a tower 2,500 feet short of the main runway,
lost a wing and a wheel, spun into the ground and disintegrated in
a fireball, Thorpe said.
   The twin-engine Gulfstream jet was flying officials of Kodak's
Arkansas Eastman subsidiary and family members from Longview,
Texas, to Batesville nearly 80 miles northeast of Little Rock.
   The flight originated in Kingsport, Tenn., with 10 people
aboard, said James M. Jones, a spokesman for Arkansas Eastman. In
Longview, two Texas Eastman officials and a spouse got off the
plane.
   The crew then decided they couldn't get to Batesville because of
the weather and headed for Little Rock, Jones told the news
conference.
   Among the dead were former Arkansas Eastman President H.L.
``Bud'' Gernert, 65, who retired last year; his wife, Marian, 65;
and Arkansas Eastman employees William Schirmer, 56; Randy Wood,
39; and Nathan Casteel, 49, all of Batesville, company officials
said. Also killed were Eastman pilots Don Mason, 59, and Ed O'Neal,
55, both of the Kingsport, Tenn., area.

   Leaf Inc., maker of such candy as Whoppers, Milk
Duds and Rain-Blo bubble gum, will abandon two Chicago factories
and lay off 650 employees, the company announced.
   Leaf said Friday it would close its 60-year-old chocolate candy
plant on the city's Near North Side early in 1992 and would shutter
a 62-year-old gum-producing plant on the Northwest Side one year
later.
   Corporate headquarters will remain in Bannockburn, Ill. Leaf
said the closings are part of a companywide modernization and
simplification.
   ``We made these announcements very, very early so we could make
fair arrangements for the future of our employees,'' James Grubiak,
senior vice president for operations, said in a statement.
   Production of the candy will be shifted to plants in Memphis,
Tenn., and Robinson, Ill., where the company makes Heath bars.
   Leaf, the world's 12th largest candy maker, had more than $500
million in U.S. sales in 1989.

<TEXT>
   China said Saturday it will quicken the pace of
democracy in Hong Kong as a critical meeting came to a close on the
future of the British colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   But Beijing's position, which it called a ``major concession,''
fell considerably short of the wishes of the territory's
politicians.
   China also announced further restrictions on top officials of
the British colony, ruling that only 15 percent of the territory's
legislators could hold foreign passports after Beijing assumes
control.
   And it indicated it would effectively split the post-1997
legislature into two houses in a decision that could facilitate
China's control over the lawmaking body.
   The decisions were taken in Canton by a sub-group of the Basic
Law Drafting Committee, which is writing the blueprint for Hong
Kong's future under Chinese rule.
   Arguments broke out throughout the day between the six delegates
from Hong Kong and the 10 from China. All have been appointed by
Beijing.
   At the end of the day, four Hong Kong delegates announced that
none of the territory's six delegates supported the pace of direct
elections.
   ``We regard ourselves as accountable to the Hong Kong people,''
they said in a statement.
   On July 1, 1997 Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule. Faith in
China's promise to retain the colony's free-wheeling capitalist
system for 50 years evaporated after the June 3-4 military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   The crackdown sparked greater calls for democracy in Hong Kong.
Politicians began pushing for 20 of the legislature's 60 seats to
be directly elected in 1991, rising to completely direct elections
in 2003. They said a strong democracy would enable Hong Kong to
resist an unstable government in Beijing and slow Hong Kong's
``brain drain.''
   Saturday, the Basic Law Committee agreed to speed up
democratization but not as fast as Hong Kong politicians would
like. Under the majority decision, 18 seats would be directly
elected in 1997, rising to 30 seats by 2003. China previously said
there would only be minor changes after 18 legislators were elected
in 1997.
   But, in a move interpreted by some as a limit on democracy, the
committee also decided to effectively split the Legislative Council
into two houses _ one of directly-elected members and one of
members chosen by special interest groups, such as labor unions and
professionals.
   Under that plan, any laws must pass a majority of each group.

<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Saturday announced new restrictions on
foreign journalists, banning them from filing reports it considers
false or endangering ``national security, unity or society's common
interests.''
   The broadly worded regulations give the government wide latitude
for controlling foreign journalists following the Jan. 11 lifting
of martial law in Beijing. The martial regulations had placed tight
restrictions on reporters.
   The Information Department may give warnings or revoke the
accreditation of journalists who violate the regulations, one
clause said.
   ``Foreign journalists and resident foreign news organizations
should observe professional news ethics and not distort the facts,
create rumors or use improper methods to interview or report,''
said the regulations, which were signed by Premier Li Peng on
Friday and took effect immediately.
   ``Foreign journalists ... cannot carry out activities that are
incompatible with their status or that endanger Chinese national
security, unity or society's common interests,'' the rules said.
   China criticized as distorted most foreign reporting on the
pro-democracy protests last spring and the June 3-4 army attack
that crushed them, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of
people.
   The government maintains the protests were a foreign-instigated
plot to overthrow the Communist system.
   During the protests, Chinese consulates abroad stopped issuing
work visas for visiting journalists, and dozens entered with
tourist visas.
   In June, the government expelled two American reporters based in
Beijing, one an Associated Press reporter and the other from the
U.S. government-funded Voice of America radio.
   The new regulations do not explain what are considered improper
methods of gathering information. Under martial law, all interviews
had to be approved by military authorities.
   The regulations make no mention of informal or on-the-street
interviews, which were permitted before martial law was imposed May
20. Even since martial law was lifted, however, few Chinese have
dared to give on-the-street interviews. Even officials often regard
interviews as political risks.
   It was not clear if the new regulations supercede a 1986 set of
rules that required foreign journalists to get approval 10 days in
advance before leaving Beijing to report elsewhere in China. That
rule has been used mainly to keep journalists from visiting Tibet,
where Buddhist monks and nuns have repeatedly demonstrated for
independence.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lesbian couple and a homosexual man who
refuse to renounce sex were ordained Saturday by two Lutheran
congregations defying church policy at the risk of expulsion.
   ``Our congregation felt this was a social justice issue, that
gays are part of the rainbow coalition of God's creation,'' said
the Rev. John Frykman of First United Lutheran Church in a
working-class neighborhood.
   Jeff Johnson, 26, was ordained before 600 members of the
congregation, which voted last month to hire him.
   Johnson has refused to take a vow of celibacy, required of
homosexual pastors but not normally mandated for heterosexuals.
   ``We see this as what God is asking us to do; we have no vested
interest,'' said Frykman, adding that to his knowledge none of his
congregation's 120 members are homosexual.
   At St. Francis Lutheran Church near the largely gay Castro
district, Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, were ordained.
   The two congregations hope the homosexual ministers, who will
not be recognized by the denomination, can bring many homosexuals
back to the flock. Among other things, the three endorsed the
concept of ``gay marriages.''
   The ordinations _ along with that of a homosexual Episcopal
pastor in Hoboken, N.J., last month with an acknowledged male mate
_ represent a foothold in mainstream Christianity by homosexuals.
   The 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church of America,
formed in 1987 by the merger of three Lutheran groups, bans
ordination of ``self-avowed, practicing homosexuals.''
   Bishop Lyle Miller has asked a disciplinary committee to
consider punitive action against the congregations. The dissident
parishes could be censured, suspended, permanently removed from the
denomination or exonerated.
   During the two-hour ceremonies, the ministerial candidates took
the customary vows, then added another: to be ``diligent workers
for justice on behalf of lesbian and gay sisters and brothers,
supporting our coming out, championing our rights, challenging
society's prejudices, and encouraging our relationships and
marriages.''
   ``Our church's policy requiring celibacy for lesbians and gay
men is an unjust vow of life,'' Johnson said before ordination.
``It is a politically motivated scandal which would deny the
reality of life-giving, intimate, creative, sexual relationships
among lesbians and gay men.''
   Despite official church objections, a sizable minority of the
denomination's lay activists and several dozen pastors have openly
supported ordaining active homosexuals.
   The local congregations say they cannot be ordered to refuse
recognition of the new ministers.
   ``We decided that punishment, even expulsion, is a risk we would
run for the sake of what's right,'' said the Rev. James Delange,
senior pastor at St. Francis.
   Johnson graduated last year from Pacific Lutheran Seminary in
Berkeley, Calif. Frost and Zillhart are recent graduates of
Lutheran Northwestern Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minn., and
have been a couple for the past five years.
   The three will serve as assistant pastors and manage an outreach
program for northern California homosexuals.
   The special ministry was organized to ``encourage gays and
lesbians to come back into the church and to encourage
congregations to welcome them as members,'' said Delange.
   ``We have allowed people who neither share nor understand our
experience to define our lives for us,'' Frost said at a news
conference. ``This must stop. It is time we embraced ourselves as
well as one another.''
   Miller has said that because the three have declared they
practice homosexuality, the ordinations cannot be recognized.

<HEAD>Report: Israel Sent Cluster Bombs to Marxist Ethiopia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States suspects that Israel has sent
cluster bombs to the Marxist Ethiopian government, The New York
Times reported
   Quoting unidentified administration officials, the newspaper
said in its Sunday editions there were unconfirmed reports that the
Ethiopian government has already used the bombs against rebels in
the northern part of the country.
   The State Department officials didn't tell the Times when the
bombs might have been sent to Ethiopia. Also, it was unclear how
many bombs were involved or whether the bombs were made in the
United States or Israel.
   One unidentified official told the newspaper that descriptions
of attacks correspond to the sound and effects of cluster bombs
although no physical evidence has been recovered.
   A cluster bomb is a destructive anti-personnel weapon consisting
of a canister packed with small bombs. When the bomb is dropped
from an aircraft, a small explosion opens the canister in midair
and the bomblets spread over an area several hundred feet in
diameter.
   Israel has developed its own version of the bomb but the United
States contends that Israel cannot export it without U.S. approval
because it was manufactured using American technology.
   Ethiopia restored diplomatic ties with Israel last year and,
since then, the United States has been concerned about Israel's
intentions to send arms to Ethiopia. Israel wants to build a strong
relationship with the government in Addis Ababa because it wants
cooperation in allowing Ethiopian Jews to emigrate to Israel.
   The matter first was made public last month by former President
Jimmy Carter. After a trip to Ethiopia, Carter said at a news
conference he had been told the Ethiopian air forced had obtained
cluster bombs ``from one of our Middle East allies to be used
against rebel villages.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government declared a
state of siege Saturday night after the slaying of an army colonel,
and police reportedly arrested and beat several opposition leaders.
   The government led by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril said the 30-day
decree was needed ``to protect democratic accomplishments against
terrorism,'' but opposition leaders said it was an attempt to
silence dissent before promised elections in October.
   The United States deplored the actions by the government, saying
they ``put at risk the democratic transititon in Haiti.''
   Government television said under the state of siege four
articles of the constitution were suspended, including one that
forbids the deportation of Haitian nationals.
   At least one of the opposition leaders, conservative Hubert de
Ronceray, later was reported deported. Max Care, a coordinator of
de Ronceray's party, said de Ronceray was deported Saturday night
to Miami.
   The government said it also re-established an entry visa
requirement for Haitians returning from abroad ``to prevent the
infiltration of terrorist agents.'' The practice, abolished shortly
after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted in 1986, often was
used to screen Haitians returning home.
   An earlier statement, also read on the TV, said the government
is taking all steps to prevent ``destabilizing maneuvers liable to
compromise the democratic process under way.''
   One opposition leader, Jean-Claude Bajeux, said in Puerto Rico
he expected that all the opposition leaders rounded up Saturday
will ``certainly get put on a plane'' and be deported.
   ``Avril will go to bed tonight with lots of enemies. He's
turning against everyone on at once,'' Bajeux said.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a harsh criticism of
the decree and the arrests, and urged the Haitian government to
rescind his actions and reiterate its commitment to free elections.
   ``By suspending four articles of the constitution, declaring a
state of seige and arresting a number of political leaders, the
government of Haiti has put at risk the democratic transititon in
Haiti,'' said the statement, read by department spokesman Richard
Boucher.
   ``Especially disturbing is the deportation, without charges,
evidence of due process, of democratic opposition leaders,'' the
statement said.
   Privately owned Radio Antilles said police earlier Saturday
arrested de Ronceray and Louis Roy, a well-known civic leader who
founded the Haitian Red Cross and is co-author of the 1987
constitution. Roy's nephew, Jean-Claude Roy, confirmed the arrest.
   Roy's whereabouts could not be determined Saturday night, but
relatives said they believed he was at the airport awaiting
deportation.
   Eight plainclothes gunmen also arrested socialist leader Serge
Gilles and three members of his Progressive National Revolutionary
Party at Gilles' home, witnesses said. Gilles was thrown to the
ground and stomped on in front of his two small children, while the
others were beaten in the groin with the butts of the guns,
witnesses said.
   Radio Antilles said police also arrested Dr. Sylvain Jolibois,
leader of the small radical Jean-Jacques Dessalines Group; Jesner
Prudent, coordinator of the center-right Movement to Establish
Democracy in Haiti party, and several members of de Ronceray's
rightist Mobilization for National Development party.
   Care said all of de Ronceray's activists were released late
Saturday. He said he thought Jolibois, who was beaten on the head,
and other arrested opposition leaders and militants would be
released as soon as they were treated for their injuries at police
headquarters.
   ``An overzealous soldier crushed his lighted cigarette in my
eye,'' Care said, adding that his back was covered with bruises
from beatings.
   Georges Werleigh, a member of Gille's party, said he, Gilles,
Prudent and five other activists of various parties were
transported to the National Palace, beaten again, and taken to
police headquarters. There, Werleigh said police released them and
said the arrests were ``a mistake.''
   The police sweep came after Col. Andre Neptune, his wife and a
servant were shot to death while riding home Friday night in the
Port-au-Prince suburb of Fontamara. Sgt. Emmanuel Eugene, duty
officer at the National Palace, said the motive for the killings
was unknown.
   Earlier Saturday, de Ronceray said 10 heavily armed soldiers
entered his home without a warrant before noon and searched it. De
Ronceray said one of the soldiers asked Mrs. de Ronceray where
their weapons were hidden.
   ``She responded, pointing to the Bible: `This is the only weapon
we have against brute force,''' de Ronceray told The Associated
Press before his arrest.
   De Ronceray, who has urged Avril to resign, also was a key
leader of the opposition to Duvalier, who fled to France in 1986
following months of protest.
   Avril, who took power in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt, has
promised to hand over power after elections this year, but
political and human rights leaders are increasingly skeptical.

   Livestock producers who use national
grasslands administered by the Forest Service will pay higher fees
beginning March 1, the Agriculture Department agency said Friday.
   Chief F. Dale Robertson said the monthly rates for grazing
livestock on grasslands in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming will rise
57 cents to $2.86 per head month.
   The Bureau of Land Management, an arm of the Interior
Department, announced last week that the fee for grazing on its
lands in 17 western states would fall 5 cents to $1.81 per month.
The Forest Service charges the same fee for grazing on some of its
other lands.
   Fees are determined through formulas that take into account
changes in private grazing rates, costs of livestock production and
other factors.
   The $2.86 fee is expected to affect more than 1,000 permit
holders who graze more than 200,000 animals on the grasslands each
year.
   The fees are charged per head-month, which is ``a month's use
and occupancy of range by one weaned or adult cow, bull, steer,
heifer, horse, burro, or mule, or five sheep or goats,'' the agency
said.

   A European Space Agency astronaut will be among the
international crew aboard the space shuttle Columbia on its
December mission, ESA announced Friday.
   Dr. Ulf Merold will serve as one of two payload specialists on
the 9-day flight that will also carry Dr. Roberta L. Bondar of the
Canadian Space Agency, mission specialists Mary L. Cleave, Norman
E. Thagard and William F. Feaddy, Air Force Col. Ronald J. Grab,
the commander of the flight, and pilot Stephan S. Oswald.
   The microgravity mission will be the first of a series using a
European-developed spacelab module. A team of more than 200
scientists in 12 countries will conduct experiments in materials
and life sciences, including gravitational plant physiology and
space physiology.
   The materials experiments in the microgravity environment will
focus on vapor crystal growth systems and protein crystal growth
among others.
   This will be Merbold's second space mission. In December 1987,
he was chosen from among 2,000 European applicants to fly aboard
the first spacelab on the 10-day mission launched Nov. 28, 1983.
   Born 1941 in Greiz, West Germany, Merbold worked as a
solid-state physicist at the Max Planck Institute for metals
research before joining ESA.

copy of the report said in its Friday editions.
   Although investigators have not been able to pinpoint the exact
cause of the fire, they found no evidence to suggest that it was
started accidentally.
   ``Most logically, the fire was intentionally set,'' said the
report obtained by The Florida Times-Union in a Freedom of
Information Act request.
   The fire broke out at 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 9, three days before the
Forrestal was to leave Mayport Naval Station, northeast of
Jacksonville, on a scheduled six-month deployment to the
Mediterranean Sea.
   Repairs delayed deployment until Nov. 3.
   Lt. Frank Thorp, a Navy spokesman in Washington, said he could
not speculate whether the fire may have been set in an attempt to
delay the ship's departure.
   The blaze started on the second deck in a funnel-type structure,
called an uptake, in the ship's No. 1 main machinery room. The
uptake forces combustion air into propulsion boilers.
   Investigators also said materials used to clean up a fuel spill
on the carrier four days earlier were improperly stored, allowing
the blaze to quickly spread. But the report praised crew for
limiting damage to the ship.
   The fire traveled through electrical cable to the No. 1 elevator
machinery room on the second deck, then ignited a blaze off one of
the carrier's hangar bays.
   The elevator is one of four used to transport aircraft from the
hangar deck to the flight deck.
   The machinery room houses the motors and cables used to raise
and lower the elevators.
   In addition to the injuries, smoke spread through the carrier,
forcing the evacuation of 1,000 sailors.

<HEAD>Wayne Williams Attorney Says Appeal Filing May Include `Shocker'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Wayne Williams said Friday he
would file petitions next month appealing Williams' murder
convictions in the Atlanta child killings, and the papers might
include a confession from another person.
   ``We may have a shocker in the way of a confession,'' New York
civil rights attorney William Kunstler said in a telephone
interview. ``It's not been reduced to writing at all. It's
something in that line (a confession) but we can't commit to it.''
   Kunstler, a member of Williams' legal team, said he notified
Butts County Superior Court Judge William H. Craig of his intention
to file papers in the case Feb. 9.
   Also participating in the conference call with Craig on Friday
was a representative of the state attorney general's office, which
must respond to the Williams filing before a hearing is held.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers was out of his office Friday,
and could not be reached for comment. An assistant said he had no
immediate comment on Kunstler's plans.
   Kunstler declined to elaborate on the confession, other than to
say it is from someone other than Williams.
   ``I am hopeful that the state of Georgia will recognize that a
monumental miscarriage of justice has occurred,'' Kunstler said.
   Williams, a self-proclaimed talent promoter and freelance
photographer, was convicted of murder in 1982 of two of 29 young
blacks killed in Atlanta from 1979 to 1981. He currently is serving
two life sentences.
   During his trial, in which the prosecution used fiber evidence,
Williams was linked to 10 other deaths in the string of slayings
that gripped the city for more than two years.
   The Georgia Supreme Court upheld Williams' convictions in 1983,
but a team of lawyers including Kunstler launched a new round of
appeals.
   Kunstler said he expected a hearing could be held within a month
of his filing.

<HEAD>State Team Turned Back From Proposed Cortland County Dump Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAYLOR, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters formed human roadblocks Friday to
twice block a state team from touring one of two proposed sites for
a dump for low-level radioactive wastes.
   Members of Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping, or CARD,
prevented a three-member crew from the state Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Siting Commission from reaching a farm owned by Arthur Allen,
who has offered 730 acres of his property to the state as a site
for a waste dump.
   ``They can come back as often as they want, they'll still find
us here,'' said Margie Schlegel, who had spent the previous 32
hours on alert at the anti-dump group's base camp.
   There were no arrests and both incidents were orderly, said
Cortland County Sheriff's Lt. Chauncey Bennett.
   ``Both times, after lengthy confrontations, the commission
people withdrew,'' he said.
   During the morning, a large throng of protesters backed by about
a dozen cars and pickup trucks blocked the team from entering on a
back road to Allen's farm, said Paul Yaman, a co-chairman of the
group. The car carrying the commission workers was spotted by one
of CARD's patrols, he said.
   The protesters kept the car trapped for about 30 minutes before
a Cortland County sheriff's deputy arrived and told them they were
illegally blocking a public road.
   CARD members in four cars followed the inspection team the
remainder of the morning. At about noon, the protesters again
formed a roadblock on another road, stopping the state car about
three miles short of Allen's farm, said Schlegel.
   The crew sat in their car for two hours before leaving, she said.
   Protesters did not prevent other cars from passing on either
road, said Bennett.
   Siting commission officials say they need to inspect the five
proposed dump locations _ three in Allegany County and two in
Cortland County _ before they can begin preliminary tests on the
sites. Following those tests, the number of sites will be narrowed
to two or three for more extensive testing.
   Under a federal mandate, the state has until Jan. 1, 1993, to
designate and develop a site to store the low-level radioactive
waste generated annually in New York by nuclear power plants,
hospitals and other facilities.
   Earlier this week, protesters turned out in the hundreds to
block the team for doing walking surveys at one of the Allegany
County sites. Thirty-nine people were arrested.
   Last month, 20 protesters were arrested during the siting
commission's first visit to Taylor, in which the state team had to
be escorted from the site by sheriff's deputies.

<HEAD>Conservatives Accuse Opposition Over Widely Unpopular New Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Conservative government on Friday accused
local authorities controlled by the opposition Labor Party of
deliberately inflating their spending in a bid to stir up
anti-government hostility over a new tax.
   The Conservatives on Thursday prevailed in voting in the House
of Commons on legislation tied to the new tax, despite defections
within the party and warnings that it could lead to a Tory defeat
in the next general election due by mid-1992.
   The new tax is called the community charge by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives and the poll tax by its opponents
after a tax on individuals that was levied in the Middle Ages. It
goes into effect in England and Wales in April. It already is in
use in Scotland.
   Local authorities are funded partly by a grant from the
government and partly by local taxation. The new tax, introduced by
the government, replaces the previous system of local taxation
known as the rates.
   The rates were levied only on property and were judged by the
government to be unfair. This was because the burden of the rates
fell unevenly and many people legitimately escaped paying them but
benefitted from garbage collection, street maintenance and other
local authority services.
   The new community charge tax, assessed against every adult in a
house instead of on the building, means bigger bills for many
households. Millions of people, such as adult offspring living at
home, who did not have to pay the rates will have to pay the new
community charge tax.
   The government says the average cost of the new tax per person
will be $470 a year. Opponents say it will be more.
   Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker in a radio interview
Friday with the British Broadcasting Corp. said the government had
evidence that local authorities controlled by Labor were busy
loading various items of expenditure on to their budgets.
   He said their aim was to inflate their spending in order to push
up the level of the new community charge tax and thereby increase
resentment against the government.
   He urged local authorities to cut back their budgets to reduce
the cost of the new community charge tax to individuals.
   But John Cunningham, Labor's campaigns coordinator, said Baker's
accusations were ``a deplorable deception.''
   Cunningham described the new community charge tax as ``the
harshest, most regressive and unfair tax imposed on the British
people in almost 400 years.''
   In the Commons on Thursday night, the government, which has a
100-seat majority in the 650-seat elected lower house of
Parliament, managed majorities of 46 and 36 in two votes on issues
related to the new tax.
   The figures indicated that about 26 Tories voted against their
government the first time, and more joined in the next.
   The House voted 318-272 and then 313-277 to approve several
motions on local government finance. It endorsed a $37 billion
central government grant to local authorities.
   Mrs. Thatcher's original aim over the new tax was to bring home
to people the high cost of electing high-spending Labor
representatives to local authorities.

<TEXT>
   City Administrator Carol Thompson, a 10-year
veteran of the District of Columbia government named Friday by
Mayor Marion Barry to take over the daily running ot it, has earned
high marks from officials as a good manager.
   Barry was charged Friday with possession of crack cocaine
following his arrest Thursday night at a downtown hotel.
   Ms. Thompson, 36, a native Washingtonian and graduate of Smith
College, was appointed as Barry's second-in-command _ the highest
non-elected position in the city government _ in 1988.
   The administrator functions much like a deputy mayor for
operations. Department heads deal with the mayor through the
administrator.
   As several departments have lost veteran leaders recently,
notably the police and health departments, Ms. Thompson has more
and more been seen as a component of stability in the city
administration.
   She declined to speak with reporters immediately, and issued a
statement which said, among other things, that she had been in
touch with department heads, members of the City Council and
members of the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees
dealing with the city's budget on Capitol Hill.
   ``I feel confident I will have the support of these legislative
branches,'' she said.
   ``I know we all will rise to the occasion. ... We are proud of
our city.''
   Ms. Thompson was appointed by Barry to the city's housing
department in 1979 and worked there until 1981.
   She then became acting director of the former Department of
License Investigations and Inspections. She directed the Consumer
and Regulatory Affairs Department from 1983 to 1986 before becoming
deputy mayor for economic development for two years.

<HEAD>Couple Held On Abuse Charges Following Neighbors' Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divorced couple was held on child-abuse
charges Friday after about 20 neighbors angered by mistreatment of
the pair's children surrounded their home and threw rocks at it,
police said.
   James Dolney, 37, and Virginia Coulter, 27, were arraigned
Thursday, four days after the hands of three of their children were
burned on the grates of a gas kitchen stove.
   ``He heated the burner on the stove and put their hands on it,''
said Police Chief Daniel Kochman. ``The mother stood by with a cold
pail of water and dipped their hands in it. When the fingers all
blistered on their hands, she broke the blisters and then poured
peroxide on them.''
   The abuse allegedly occurred Sunday evening after the children _
Jonathan and Jeffrey, both 5, and Steven, 3 _ got into Dolney's
tool box, Kochman said.
   Jonathan and Jeffrey spent four days in the West Penn Hospital
Burn Unit, and Steven was treated and released. Those three
children, and another son, 22-month-old Thomas, have been removed
from the family and placed in foster homes by the Allegheny County
Department of Children and Youth Services, Kochman said.
   McKeesport detectives arrested the couple Thursday when they
showed up at a Juvenile Court hearing in Pittsburgh seeking to
regain custody of the children, he said.
   More than a year ago, the children were taken out of the home
because they were being abused, Kochman said. The two oldest
children were returned to their mother in May and the two youngest
were returned in November with the provision that Dolney wasn't
allowed to see them.
   The couple had been divorced and were living together again, he
said.
   Kochman said the latest incident of abuse caused an uproar in
the couple's neighborhood. He and four other officers had to go to
the couple's house Monday evening when neighbors gathered outside
the house, flattened the tires of Dolney's car and threw rocks.
   After talking with the crowd and assuring them an arrest was
imminent, the group left the area, Kochman said.
   ``I totally understand their concern and the way they felt,'' he
said. ``It's a heinous crime, one that totally disgusts me. My hope
is they never see those kids again.
   ``However, I can't agree with vigilantism.''
   Victor Papale, director of Children and Youth Services, declined
to comment specifically about the case because of confidentiality.
   Dolney and Ms. Coulter each were charged with one count of
conspiracy and three counts of reckless endangerment. Dolney also
was charged with three counts each of endangering the welfare of
children and aggravated assault.
   Dolney was being held on $25,000 cash bond and Ms. Coulter on
$10,000 bond pending a preliminary hearing Thursday.

<HEAD>Herbert Wehner, former Social Democratic Leader, Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herbert Wehner, the fiery orator who
quit the Communist Party to become of one West Germany's leading
Social Democrats, has died, a spokesman said. He was 83.
   Wehner died late Friday at his home in the Bonn suburb of Bad
Godesberg, Social Democratic Party spokesman Eduard Heussen said.
   He had been seriously ill for several years, suffering from
diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and sclerosis.
   One of the most influential post-war Social Democratic
politicians who had been a member of West Germany's parliament for
33 years, Wehner was born on July 11, 1906 in Dresden, the son of a
shoemaker.
   After studying to become a salesman, Wehner joined the German
Communist Party when he was 21. He became a member of the party's
Central Committee in the early 1930s.
   When Adolf Hitler's Nazis came to power in 1933, Wehner went
underground and two years later fled to exile. He lived in Belgium,
the Netherlands, Prague and Paris, where he organized German emigre
groups that went to Spain to fight in the Spanish civil war on the
Republican side.
   Imprisoned in Prague, Wehner was expelled to Moscow, where he
worked for some time as an official in the Cominform Executive
Committee.
   In 1941, he went to Stockholm and was instructed by the party to
investigate which of the German Communists in Sweden collaborated
with the Gestapo. Wehner was jailed for one year in 1942 for
``threatening Sweden's freedom and neutrality.''
   During his imprisonment Wehner decided to leave the Communist
Party, and was formally expelled from the party which accused him
of betraying its cause.
   Wehner returned to Germany in 1946 and joined the Social
Democrats. From 1958 to 1973, he was a deputy party chairman.
   He entered Parliament in 1960 and nine years later became the
parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats, a post he held until
leaving his seat in 1983.
   Wehner, a passionate pipe smoker, became famous for his fiery
and often controversial speeches in Parliament and served as
minister for intra-German affairs from 1966 to 1969 during the
so-called grand coalition government.
   When Willy Brandt became chancellor in 1969, Wehner became one
of his closest aides in forging the Ostpolitik, leading many
delegations on ground-breaking visits to East European countries.
   Wehner was married three times, the last time in 1983 when he
married his foster daughter Greta Burmester.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   President Bush says the end of former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega's rule should be a lesson for the
``two holdouts preventing a totally democratic hemisphere,'' Cuba's
Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.
   ``So let Daniel Ortega and Fidel take note, like the dinosaur,
the day of the dictator is over,'' Bush declared to a standing
ovation at a Republican dinner.
   Bush, who celebrates the first anniversary of his inauguration
today in the privacy of the presidential retreat in Camp David,
Md., kicked off the off-year election season by appearing Friday
night at a $1,500-a-plate dinner for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's
November re-election effort.
   Speaking in the city where Noriega remains in custody awaiting
trial, Bush praised prosecutors for assembling a team ``to make

   In a show of support for an emerging
democracy, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit
Czechoslovakia next month after he holds talks in Moscow on easing
East-West tensions.
   U.S. officials say Baker may add other Eastern and Central
European stops to his schedule, as the Bush administration steps up
its campaign of trying to encourage Warsaw Pact countries to adopt
Western political and economic systems.
   Czechoslovakia is making that transition with little indication
of tension. It flirted with reform in 1968 and then experienced two
decades of hard-line rule after the ``Prague Spring'' was
extinguished by Soviet troops and tanks.
   Baker, who is going to Moscow on Feb. 4 for talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, also is considering stops
in Romania and Bulgaria, the U.S. officials said Friday.

   R.J. Reynolds Tobbaco Co.'s decision to

   Reynolds' announcement on Friday came a day after Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan attacked the company for
promoting a ``culture of cancer.''
   The company said anti-smoking advocates misrepresented Reynolds'
plans for a campaign that was to begin in Philadelphia in three
weeks for a new menthol cigarette called Uptown.
   ``We regret that a small coalition of anti-smoking zealots
apparently believes that black smokers are somehow different from
others who choose to smoke and must not be allowed to exercise the
same freedom of choice available to all other smokers,'' said Peter
Hoult, Reynolds executive vice president of marketing.

   Hobbyhorses date back to ancient Greece but
remain a favorite toy for space-age tots. Ask Chuck Sakolsky, who
was in charge of making and selling nearly $5.5 million worth last
year.
   ``The funny thing is that even though it is a rocket-ship world,
kids' interest in horses has never gone away. The hobbyhorse is as
basic to the toy business as anything there is,'' said Sakolsky,
general manager of the Wonder Products Inc. factory in northwest
Louisiana's Bossier City, near Shreveport.
   The Wonder Horse _ a heavy-duty plastic horse molded in
mid-gallop and held up by steel springs _ is a 20th century
descendant of the hobbyhorse, a stick with a horse's head at one
end.
   Toy historians have traced hobbyhorses to the time of Socrates
and to illustrations in a French Book of Hours in the 15th century.
No references to rocking horses are known before the 17th century,
but whenever they were invented, they had become immensely popular
by the 1800s.
   Wonder introduced the spring-mounted horse in 1939, Sakolsky
said, and bouncing horses all but eliminated American-made molded
rocking horses from toy departments by the middle 1970s.
   ``Mostly what's out there are flat pieces of wood put together
to look like a horse,'' he said, adding that most of today's molded
horses on rockers are imported and are either expensive or cheap.
   The Wonder company plans to reintroduce its rocking horse this
year, capitalizing on growing nostalgia among parents and older
people.
   Like the rocking horse, Wonder is coming back from almost
nothing.
   The company was founded in Memphis, Tenn.; the move to Bossier
City came after it had been sold twice. CBS Inc., the broadcasting
and entertainment concern that owned a Louisiana swingset company
called Gym Dandy, put the two together.
   ``CBS got out of the toy business a couple years back. ... They
sold the company to some of its managers. They really didn't have
the wherewithal to keep it going,'' Sakolsky said.
   Basic or not, the company went under. Rotocast Plastic Products
Inc. of Miami bought it for $2.5 million last year at a sheriff's
sale and brought in Sakolsky to run it.
   ``We've doubled our business since 1987 and we'll double it
again in 1990,'' he said.
   Sakolsky estimated that Wonder sold about $3 million worth of
toys in 1988, $5.5 million in 1989 and probably will sell nearly
$10 million worth in 1990. He declined to give the number of toys
sold but said the company has relationships with retailers ranging
from large toy chains to small shops.
   ``At one time, we had close to 70 percent of the market,'' he
said. ``In 1988, I think we had around 30 percent. I believe we'll
have 50 percent of the market by 1990.''
   The company's mainstay remains the spring-mounted horse, which
retails anywhere from $40 _ for a 28-inch model suitable for a 2-or
3-year-old _ to more than $100.
   ``We have palominos, roans, pintos ... we're coming out with a
dapple gray,'' he said.
   Sakolsky also has gone back through 40 years of catalogs to find
products worth bringing back, and has created a couple of his own.
   Last year the company introduced a horse of a brighter color _ a
hand-painted replica of a 1914 carousel horse, painted in vivid
merry-go-round hues, priced at $150. The same horse, mounted on a
brass pole and sold as furniture, retails for up to $500.
   ``It is the Rolls-Royce of the ride-on horses,'' said Sakolsky.
``I sort of think of these as grandmother horses, because it's the
sort of thing a grandmother looks at and says, `Gee _ that's what
my grandchild has to have.'''

   While the auto industry has struggled with a
series of much-publicized problems in recent months, manufacturers
of heavy trucks have been traveling a similar rocky road.
   That goes not only for the state of their businesses, but also
for the treatment their stocks have received on Wall Street.
   In 1989, while the stock market as a whole was rising about 25
percent, the Dow Jones index of auto manufacturing issues dropped
8.36 percent. Transportation equipment, a group that includes
several producers of trucks and truck parts, fared worse with a
9.81 percent decline.
   So far in 1990, both groups have slumped further as the general
market has come under pressure.
   While the fortunes of car and truck makers might seem subject to
many of the same influences, they are two different types of
businesses in the eyes of the analysts who follow them.
   Cars, and light trucks commonly owned by the public, carry the
label of cyclical consumer goods, sold in a marketplace whose mood
is set by such forces as disposable income and consumer interest
rates.
   Medium- and heavy-duty trucks, by contrast, are classed as
capital equipment like factory machinery, subject to the ups and
downs of the industrial economy and of the confidence of business
planners.
   Dealers' truck sales in the United States began 1989 at a
record-setting pace, and then fell sharply by late summer. ``It was
a huge swing,'' said Frank Prezelski, an analyst who follows the
industry for Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. in New York.
   After a small net decline in sales for 1989 as a whole,
Prezelski projects a further decrease of 10 percent to 15 percent
in 1990.
   At their present level, ``we believe capital goods stocks
reflect a recession, or at least a meaningful downturn,'' said
Karen Ubelhart, an analyst who follows the group for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Although investment opportunities may be developing in some
other types of equipment stocks, she added, ``we would continue to
avoid the truck sector. Despite substantial stock declines, we
believe the chance of further earnings-per-share disappointment
exists.''
   Some of the stock declines have been substantial indeed.
Loss-plagued Mack Trucks, which Ubelhart characterizes as ``a
troubled company in a troubled industry,'' has lately traded at a
little above $5 in the over-the-counter market, down from $15.37 at
its early-1989 peak.
   The stock of Navistar, a major truck producer traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, has fallen over the same period from near $7
to around $4.
   Prezelski at Deutsche Bank agrees that the near-term news for
the industry is likely to remain negative.
   But further ahead, he sees a ``super cycle of the '90s''
developing that would produce a dramatic improvement.
   ``After a slow start in 1990, we expect an acceleration of
orders and shipments for several years, culminating in a peak of
demand, probably in 1993, in both North America and Europe,''
Prezelski says in a current report on the industry,
   ``We believe that the early 1990s will see all-time record truck
demand in North America and probably in Europe due to the need to
replace aging fleets in the United States and the repositioning of
European truckers for the changing market of the post-1992 period
as European Common Market integration becomes a reality.''

<TEXT>
   Whatever dance the stock and bond markets do in
the days and weeks ahead, Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal
Reserve Board is likely to be calling the tune.
   That's the near-unanimous expectation on Wall Street as
Greenspan prepares for a series of appearances before varous
committees of Congress beginning this coming week.
   Greenspan makes his Capitol Hill rounds at a time when hopes are
dimming for any further moves by the Fed to relax its credit policy.
   If the outlook for the U.S. economy alone were at issue,
analysts say, the central bank would have a few problems pushing
interest rates lower right now, given a recent revival of worries
about inflation.
   But that's not the biggest deterrent bothering the private
analysts and economists who make their living trying to guess the
Fed's next move.
   There also is the new variable of rising interest rates in
Japan, West Germany and other industrialized countries, in some
cases to their highest levels in several years.
   This tends to exert upward pressure on U.S. interest rates,
because yields on American securities must remain competitive to
attract money from international investors.
   If the Fed should choose to fight that pressure, many analysts
believe, the result could well be a dollar decline in foreign
exchange.
   But many observers see potential pitfalls as well in a
restrictive Fed policy. Such an approach theoretically increases
the chances of a recession.
   Beyond that, many believe it is a perilous approach in a period
of shaky credit conditions in the ``junk'' bond market and at banks
with problem loans on their hands.
   ``During a period of financial distress, many shocks can occur
and overwhelm the financial markets,'' said Hugh Johnson, an
analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``The effect of these shocks can be aggravated by a Federal
Reserve that is reluctant (justifiably so) to add liquidity to the
markets each time a decline occurs.
   ``There is a risk that the Federal Reserve will be seduced, by
declines in the dollar or intermittently strong inflation and
economic data, into keeping interest rates too high, too long.''
   With such worries dragging it down, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials dropped 11.31 to 2,677.90 in the past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell .76 to 187.56;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.16 to 440.88, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 6.15 at 366.08.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 172.26 million shares a day,
against 161.92 million the week before.
   For much of last year, the Fed generally was perceived to be
facing a choice between two relatively straightforward options _
tightening credit to slow inflation or easing it to stave off
recession.
   The assignment was a juggling act, to be sure, but there were
really only two balls that had to be kept in the air.
   Now, many observers worry, the central bank may be faced with
more elaborate challenges, some of which seem to be mutually
contradictory.
   ``It is hard to ascribe a universal cause'' to the problem of
rising interest rates overseas, said James Grant, editor of the
biweekly Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   ``Inflation in Japan, oil prices notwithstanding, is quoted at
only 1{ percent. Inflation in Switzerland is 5 percent. Yet
interest rates are up, violently, in both countries.
   ``Money-market yields have been rising in West Germany, where
economic growth is sizzling. But they have not been falling
appreciably in the U.S., where growth is vanishing.
   ``The Federal Reserve would no doubt prefer to be easier,''
Grant said, ``but the dollar and the domestic inflation rate tie
its hands.''

<TEXT>
   The price of stocks at any one time has a lot to
do with dreams, the level of lassitude in the herd, and the madness
of the crowd, but beneath all that are some fairly good yardsticks.
   Here are some of them at mid-January, provided by the
statisticians at Wright Investors' Service, which believes in the
superiority of fact over opinion, evidence over wishes, and hunches
and reason over all.
   At mid-month the Dow Jones industrial average was down 5 percent
from its Jan. 2 all-time high of 2,810.15 points, and Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index was off 6.3 percent from its high.
   But these readings are dominated by the bigger companies. While
the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 still showed gains
of nearly 20 percent over the past year, the broader-based Value
Line composite index has risen only 5 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRICE-EARNINGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At about 337 in mid-January, the S&amp;P 500 was priced at 14.5
times estimated earnings for the previous 12 months, or well below
the peak of 21 in the summer of 1987. Based on anticipated
year-ahead earnings, the P-E was 14, compared to 14.8 in 1987.
   For comparison, the S&amp;P's postwar average P-E is 13.5, and its
latest 20-year average is 12.2.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRICE-CASH FLOW</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The S&amp;P industrial average at mid-month was priced at 7.6 times
estimated 1990 cash flow, about 20 percent higher than the 6.2
price-cash flow multiple averaged over the past 20 years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRICE-EQUITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At its peak in August 1987, the S&amp;P 500 was priced at 2.4 times
its equity value; at mid-month, the market's price-equity ratio is
2.2.
   Comment from Wright: ``This multiple shows the market in its
worst light, since 2 times book value has time and again acted as a
warning signal of an impending market correction.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRICE-SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The S&amp;P industrial average was priced at 69 percent of estimated
1990 sales, a level almost one-quarter higher than its 20-year
average of 55 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRICE-OPERATING PROFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At mid-month, the S&amp;P 500 was priced at 226 percent of its
average price level of the past 20 years. In contrast, corporate
operating profits are running at just 156 percent of their
1970-1989 average.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WRIGHT'S ASSESSMENT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Most stock market price-value measures are currently on the
high side, suggesting that any negative economic or corporate news
is likely to produce a decline in stock prices.
   ``Since the outlook for operating profits remains weak, it is
reasonable to expect that the recent weakness in stock prices will
extend further into 1990.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WRIGHT'S FORECAST:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Economic growth in 1990 is likely to fall below consensus
expectations, with disappointing corporate earnings.
   ``Consequently, until interest rates decline and economic
fundamentals improve, the stock market's negative trends are likely
to persist. Wright expects bond market returns to exceed equity
returns in the coming year.''
   That message went out last week from the Bridgeport, Conn.
headquarters of of Wright, an international adviser to
institutional investors and manager of large portfolios.

<HEAD>Campeau's Financial Plight Only Part of the Retailing Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few talk-radio listeners in the New York area
have not heard that Bonds, the men's clothing store, is going out
of business. Bonds, owned by Eagle Clothes Inc., has bombarded the
airwaves with ads touting its close-out sale.
   The store is not alone in its predicament.
   Mattress discounter Bed City Shops Inc., fur retailer Antonovich
Inc. and the Foxmoor women's clothing chain are among several
retailers sorting out their finances under the supervision of
bankruptcy court.
   Now that Federated Stores Inc. _ the renamed holding company for
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. department store operations _ has been added
to the list, customers are wondering whether something is rotten in
retailing.
   The answer, say analysts and store executives, is not really.
Some companies, like Campeau, have peculiar problems, and in
general, the shake-out is part of a natural winnowing process in
the business.
   Campeau's fall from grace, although the largest bankruptcy case
in retailing history, had almost nothing to do with the business of
selling merchandise.
   Rather, the Campeau stores were victims of a love affair with
leverage, a legacy of the 1980s takeover obsession.
   Most of the blame belongs to Robert Campeau, founder of the
Canadian real estate development company, who borrowed heavily to
finance his dream of presiding over a vast retail domain. His
advisers helped turn the dream into a nightmare by failing to
foresee that the price he would pay was too dear.
   The huge sums spent for Federated Department Stores Inc. in 1988
and Allied Stores Corp. in 1986 saddled the two with $7.7 billion
in debt. By September it became clear their profits couldn't cover
their debt payments. On Jan. 15, their fate was put into the hands
of a Cincinnati bankruptcy court judge.
   But famous retail names in the Campeau constellation, including
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Jordan Marsh and Lazarus, are not likely
to disappear, going the way of now-defunct W.T. Grant Co.
   Industry experts make the point that in contrast to the Campeau
debacle, Grant failed in 1975 largely because of mismanagement.
Campeau's stores, which were profitable before being leveraged to
the hilt to finance the mergers, could emerge from their Chapter 11
restructuring _ possibly separated and under new ownership _ with
minimal damage to their reputations.
   Avijit Ghosh, a marketing professor at the New York University's
Leonard N. Stern School of Business, said recent developments in
retailing reflect the overall business climate in which
consolidations have sometimes required painful adjustments.
   ``Retailing has been going through a shake-out period,'' but the
industry as we know it isn't in its death throes, Ghosh said.
   ``Ten years ago everybody was talking about the fact that
specialty stores would wipe out department stores,'' Ghosh said.
``That has not happened. Department stores have held their own.''
   Many department stores are thriving. Cash-rich May Department
Stores Co. has become the envy of the debt-laden; Nordstrom Inc. is
admired for its service; while J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Dayton Hudson
Corp. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. have become darlings of
Wall Street investment analysts.
   The star performers are following a principle of retailing: They
adapt to changing customer tastes and spending patterns. Those who
can't change fall by the wayside.
   ``We are a self-cleansing industry,'' said William R. Howell,
chairman and chief executive officer of Penney.
   That means when women shun mini-skirts, stores must stock more
mid-calf lengths, for instance. Or when consumers decide regular
retailers charge too much, stores must prove their prices are fair,
as Sears, Roebuck and Co. is trying to do with its highly
publicized switch last March to ``everyday low prices.''
   The success so far of Sears' pricing policy hasn't been
impressive. Sears hasn't made itself distinctive enough to give
people new reasons to shop there. Analysts say the giant retailer
better make up its mind fast on an identity because better-focused,
faster-growing competitors are snapping at its heels.
   Some of the serious problems that do exist in retailing are
symptoms of highly saturated markets. What is going on in the New
York metropolitan area is a prime example of how hard it is for too
many stores to co-exist without cutting each others' throats.
   Stores such as Bonds and Bed City ran into trouble to some
extent because they had too many competitors. High rents didn't
help matters.
   ``I think the country is overstored. Many of us fell into the
trap of opening stores everywhere but the customer ends up paying
more money because somebody's got to foot the bill for the rent,''
said Jeremiah Crowley, president and chief executive officer of Bed
City.
   In an industry where only the fittest should survive, the
publicity over the Federated bankruptcy filing has drawn unfair
attention, store executives contend.
   Harwell W. Proffitt, chairman emeritus of Proffitt's Department
Stores based in Alcoa, Tenn., outside of Knoxville, said the
situation makes him sad.
   ``The public I think perceives that our industry has a
problem,'' he said while in New York attending a national merchants
convention this past week. ``Retailers are getting a bum rap they
don't deserve.''

<HEAD>Advertisers Angle to Reach Huge Super Bowl TV Audience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's Super Bowl telecast promises to have
it all _ fast moves, wild sounds, emotional performances from some
old veterans and the emergence of some newcomers. And that's only
in the commercials.
   A car commercial that is to debut on the program next Sunday has
generated irate complaints that the ad promotes irresponsible
driving. A soft drink maker is using a new ``three-dimensional''
sound technique in an ad which also reunites some people who
appeared in a similar commercial nearly 20 years ago. And being
introduced is a new shaving instrument on which its creator already
has invested $200 million and a decade in development.
   For those who get bored with the game, a beer company has come
up with a football simulation for the second year pitting teams of
helmeted beer bottles against each other in a contest played out
over five commercials.
   Broadcasts of the National Football League's annual championship
game, which this year matches the San Francisco 49ers against the
Denver Broncos, traditionally attract one of television's biggest
audiences of the year.
   That has enabled the network airing the game to charge record
amounts for advertising time on the show. CBS is charging $700,000
for a 30-second commercial in this year's game, up from $675,000 on
the 1989 broadcast.
   Advertisers view the broadcast as an opportunity to expose new
products or advertising campaigns. Some use the sponsorship to
motivate sales forces.
   In Super Bowl broadcasts over the past decade, Apple Computer
introduced its Macintosh personal computer with an Orwellian ad
that only ran once, Burger King found the goofy guy named Herb who
had never eaten its burgers and Timex showed divers who unearthed a
replica of its new watch beneath the Red Sea.
   ``It is not just a high-rated show _ it's an event,'' said
Arnold Chase, director of network operations from the ad agency
Bozell. ``People make a date to watch the Super Bowl. They don't
plan anything else for that afternoon.''
   Hal Trencher, vice president of sports marketing and sales for
CBS Sports, said that despite the higher price, all 28 minutes of
commercials in this year's game were sold by Thanksgiving. Twenty
different advertisers bought time in the game, down from 30 last
year. ``The idea seems to be if you are going to be in it, you
dominate it with as much inventory as possible,'' Trencher said.
   But the price has gotten too high for some advertisers,
including some who tried to capitalize on the popularity of the
game anyway.
   Holiday Inns Inc., based in Memphis, Tenn., spent more than $5
million this fall on a campaign in which it selected a dozen people
over a 12-week period for trips to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.
The company announced a winner a week in commercials on ``Monday
Night Football'' broadcasts on ABC.
   The winners will be at the game, but Holiday Inns won't be on
the Super Bowl broadcast. ``It's pretty cost-prohibitive for us,''
said spokeswoman Faith Morris.
   Sterling Drug Co. ran a promotion in nine cities this fall that
it called the ``Phillips' Milk of Magnesia Super Bowl Flush.''
Radio announcers asked listeners to name the activity most
frequently performed during the Super Bowl. Those who called to say
``toilet flushing'' were entered in a sweepstakes with nine winners
getting trips to the Super Bowl.
   Spokesman Terry Kelly said the company was not sure as of Friday
whether it could buy commercial time for the laxative on the game
broadcast.
   Here are a few commercial highlights to look for in the Super
Bowl broadcast:
   FAST MOVES: Nissan Motor Corp. in USA plans to run a new ad for
its Nissan 300ZX Turbo that shows a driver fantasizing about the
car outrunning a motorcyle, a race car and a jet plane. The
industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety asked Nissan
and CBS not to run the ad. ``It sends out just one message _ look
how fast this car can go,'' said institute president Brian O'Neill.
Nissan plans to run the ad anyway. CBS declined comment.
   WILD SOUNDS: Coca-Cola Co. is employing a new sound technique on
a 60-second commercial that reprises its 1971 ad featuring the
song, ``I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing.'' The technique
generates sound that seems to be coming from many points in a room,
but it will be picked up only on stereo TV sets.
   OLD FACES: Coca-Cola reunites about two dozen people who
appeared in the 1971 ``Hilltop'' ad and shows their children
joining them in song on the same Italian hilltop where the first ad
was shot. Pepsi-Cola Co. has new ads with former Pepsi product
promoters Michael J. Fox and San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana.
Anhueser-Busch Inc. plays its ``Bud Bowl II'' clash of beer bottles
in several ads. The Budweiser team defeated Bud Lite last year.
   NEWCOMERS: Gillette Co. will be introducing its Sensor shaving
product that it unveiled for the trade and the media last year and
on which it is banking considerable resources. Toyota Motor Sales
USA Inc. and General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac division also have new
ads.

   When Campeau Corp.'s department stores sought
bankruptcy court sanctuary, it didn't surprise Wall Street
dealmakers who months ago saw the takeover business punctured by
the failure of the company's record retailing buyout.
   But Campeau's latest problems seem to have driven another stake
into the heart of the once-raging market for corporate buyouts.
   Bankers and investment firms have become even warier. And,
``it's made investors more cautious,'' said Perrin Long, a
securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services Corp.
   Campeau's department store divisions, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., filed for protection from
their creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   The divisions have a combined $7.7 billion in debt. Much of it
was borrowed through high-interest junk bonds to finance the
purchases by Campeau, a Canadian real estate developer, of Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   The takeover business, which boomed in the '80s on the back of
junk bond financing, had to shift quickly into low gear after
Campeau revealed its troubles last September. Financing for several
deals, including Ramada Inc.'s restructuring and Coniston Partners'
acquisition of TW Services Inc., had to be revamped because of junk
bond market gyrations.
   Furthermore, big banks made cautious by the Campeau mess refused
to back a planned employee-management buyout of United Airlines'
parent UAL Corp.
   Suddenly, takeover financing appeared to be drying up. Wall
Street reacted by throwing a tantrum _ the collapse of the UAL deal
helped send the Dow Jones industrial average plunging 190 points on
Oct. 13.
   By the time Federated and Allied headed into court last week _
as many observers had expected would happen _ investment bankers
and dealmakers already were coping with a changed environment. But
experts say the Campeau filing has helped to subdue the buyout
market further.
   Companies still will be bought and sold, but finding bond
investors will be difficult, said Long.
   ``We're in a transitional period because junk bond financing
kind of has a dirty name,'' he said.
   Norman Weinger and Michael Metz, two Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analysts,
agreed in a report last week that mergers and acquisitions will
involve bigger commitments of equity by buyers.
   Investors simply don't want to leave themselves open to the
kinds of losses that Campeau's creditors are facing.
   Investment firms were listed among Campeau's biggest creditors.
The firms own or hold for others billions of dollars in Federated
and Allied bonds, and also put up millions of their own dollars for
short-term bridge loans to help Campeau complete the Federated deal.
   First Boston Corp., Campeau's lead adviser in the Federated
deal, could lose as much as $293 million, according to Fred Garcia,
a First Boston spokesman.
   Of that amount, $43 million is from junk bonds owned by First
Boston, Garcia said. The remaining $250 million is from a bridge
loan.
   First Boston already has provided for any losses by charging
them against its 1989 earnings, Garcia said, adding that the
company still showed a profit for the year.
   Another of Campeau's more than 50,750 creditors is PaineWebber
Inc., which put up a $95 million bridge loan in the Federated
buyout.
   A PaineWebber spokesman, Jeffrey Taufield, said the company's
losses on the loan have been offset somewhat by fees it collected
on the Federated deal. Like First Boston, PaineWebber has adjusted
its 1989 earnings to reflect any losses from the unpaid loan.
   Publicly, the companies portrayed any losses as a fact of
investment banking life.
   ``We remain committed to the merchant banking business,
understanding _ as has been demonstrated very clearly _ that it is
a high risk and high reward business,'' said Garcia.
   PaineWebber officials will continue looking at opportunities
``in companies where they believe there is long-term potential,''
Taufield said.
   But investment bankers have been chastened somewhat by the
Campeau filing.
   ``It would be foolish for us not to consider current market
conditions in any transaction,'' said an employee at one Wall
Street firm. ``We're not backing away _ but we've got our eyes
open.''
   Long predicted investment firms would move to reduce their
exposure to bridge loans, which generally are refinanced with bond
sales. The firms and other creditors are lining up to see how much
they can recover from Campeau.
   Long speculated the firms might get 20 cents back for each
dollar they lent.
   Besides their own balance sheets, dealmakers are also concerned
that Campeau's troubles may revive anti-takeover sentiment in
Washington.
   A year ago, after the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc. but well before Campeau's problems became public,
congressional committees held hearings on possible ways of curbing
debt-financed buyouts.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks has already
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the Campeau
filing and and look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts.
   Brooks said he feared the Chapter 11 filing was ``only the
beginning, and that we will see the takeover trophies of the 1980s
become the bankruptcy case names of the 1990s.''
   Another I-told-you-so came from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
whose state is home base for Federated and Allied.
   ``Campeau represents the merger mania of the '80s, when
companies were more interested in devouring one another than
producing a better product,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Congress was out of town last week and spokesmen for the Senate
Finance and House Ways and Means committees said there had been no
discussion of those panels holding new hearings in the wake of the
Campeau filing.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ who last year testified that
investors could be ``left holding the bag'' if debt-laden buyout
targets ran into trouble _ has not commented publicly on the
Campeau filing.
   Brady last year did not advocate any limits on takeovers, saying
market forces should be allowed to determine the future of the
buyout process.
   Congress passed some minor restrictions on the deductibility of
interest from debt-financed buyouts last year. Jim Jaffe, an aide
to Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said the
committee was unable to garner enough support for more substantive
changes because of a lack of guidance from the Bush administration.
   ``That is really what people are waiting for,'' Jaffe said.
``They figure it's not worth doing anything if the administration
isn't going to ultimately sign on.''

millions of callers, the phone giant scrambled to fix its image by
apologizing and offering compensation. When the top U.S. health
official blasted R.J. Reynolds for peddling a new cigarette to
blacks, the company chastised him for paternalism.
   Two of the best-known corporations in American business were
responding to potentially enormous public relations crises this
past week. But their strategies couldn't have differed more.
   ``I think it's clear that AT&amp;T responded admirably by accepting
criticism and trying to make amends for what was clearly a loss of
service,'' said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the
Consumer Federation of America, a Washington-based public interest
group. ``Certainly, RJR didn't respond the way AT&amp;T did.''
   On Friday, R.J. Reynolds announced it was canceling its
Philadelphia test marketing of the new cigarette, saying the
company's efforts have been misrepresented by smoking opponents.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance service has
been touted by the company as the most sophisticated and reliable
in the world. When it abruptly failed for nine hours on Martin
Luther King day, the company faced one of the most serious public
image problems since the breakup of the Bell System monopoly last
decade.
   The company, which has 80 million customers and dominates the
long-distance market, admitted a lapse in its standards, apologized
in full-page newspaper ads and offered Valentine's Day discounts to
compensate.
   ``I would give AT&amp;T high marks for facing up to the public and
not trying to be secretive about it, not trying to stonewall,''
said James Arnold, president of Chester Burger Co., a New York
consulting firm that specializes in public relations.
   Robert Irvine, a Louisville-based public relations consultant
and the author of ``When You Are the Headline,'' a book of advice
to public figures on how to respond to crises, said AT&amp;T shrewdly
executed what he called ``classical crisis management.''
   ``Once they knew they had the problem, they disclosed it
quickly,'' he said. ``Now the Valentine's thing is a little cute,
but it's their way of saying, `We want to do something.'''
   Irvine and other public-relations experts said R.J. Reynolds, on
the other hand, may have caused itself an unwanted problem with a
decision to manufacture and test-market a new cigarette aimed at
blacks, called Uptown.
   Blacks historically have suffered higher rates of cancer and
other smoking-related illnesses, and R.J. Reynolds' strategy has
been seized upon by anti-smoking groups as another example of what
they call the tobacco industry's cynical and sleazy business
practices.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan elevated the
criticism this past week by traveling to Philadelphia, the key
Uptown test market, and accusing R.J. Reynolds of promoting a
``culture of cancer.''
   Though the company declined to respond publicly, it implicitly
rebuked Sullivan by saying it was ``disturbed by the sense of
paternalism'' surrounding the controversy, as though blacks were
less able to choose to smoke.
   ``What R.J. Reynolds did was to base its strategy on marketing
decisions,'' consultant Arnold said. ``They ran afoul of public
attitudes and it has made them appear to be out of sync.'''
   In announcing the decision to cancel the test, Peter Hoult, RJR
executive vice president of marketing, said, ``We regret that a
small coalition of anti-smoking zealots apparently believes that
black smokers are somehow different from others who choose to smoke
and must not be allowed to exercise the same freedom of choice
available to all other smokers.''
   Before Friday's announcement, Ahron Leichtman, president of the
Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke, a Washington-based activist group,
said he saw R.J. Reynolds' behavior in the Uptown controversy as
the start of a possibly broad new front in the battle against
cigarette consumption.
   ``There are no ethics with these tobacco industry executives, no
ethics. If they don't get 5,000 new smokers every day, they lose
money,'' he said. ``This R.J. Reynolds Uptown campaign just may
blow up in their face.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The Campeau Corp. of Canada, owner of many famous U.S.
department store chains ranging from Bloomingdale's to Burdine's,
put them into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors
because of a crushing debt load. It was the biggest bankruptcy
filing in retailing history and one of the biggest casualties of
the merger craze of the 1980s, when Campeau bought the stores with
billions of dollars in loans. The stores said they would remain
open.
   _Bank of New England Corp., one of the biggest banks in the
Northeast, said it expects to report a loss of $1.05 billion for
1989 because of bad real estate debt and was seeking to sell more
than $6 billion in assets to stay solvent. Banking industry
analysts interpreted the action as another grave sign of economic
problems in New England and speculated that the federal government
might have to take over the bank.
   _Corporate profits and the government's latest data combined to
show the economy remains weak and inflation hasn't gone away, which
left the stock and bond markets unsettled. Major computer makers
reported sharply lower fourth-quarter results; Boeing, Conrail and
Pillsbury were among prominent companies announcing job cuts; the
November trade deficit widened to $11.5 billion, the worst showing
in 11 months; and inflation statistics showed the 1989 rate totaled
4.6 percent, the worst since 1981.

<HEAD>FDA Recalls Mislabeled Pain Reliever for Children in Two States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has recalled
Carriage brand Children's Non-Aspirin Pain Relief chewable tablets
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, saying some bottles contained
potentially toxic doses for children.
   The bottles are filled with adult sinus tablets and had been
mislabeled as the children's medicine, the FDA said.
   The FDA said the instructions on the mislabeled bottles could
result in a child taking a dose of acetaminophen four times higher
than the children's dose and potentially toxic doses of two other
ingredients _ the decongestant phenyl propanolamine and the
antihistimine phentoloxamine.
   The FDA said the bottles were labeled as chewable tablets of
acetaminophen 80 milligrams with lot number 082427 and the
expiration date 9-90 on the bottom of the bottle. The recall covers
CR Pharmacies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   American Pharmaceutical Co. of Passaic, N.J., manufactures the
lot for CR Pharmacies, owned by Laneco Supermarkets. Calls to
American Pharmaceutical's office were not answered Friday evening.
   The manufacturer estimates that about 100 bottles of the adult
sinus medicine were mislabeled as the chewable acetaminophen for
children, the FDA said in a statement. The mislabeled bottles were
included in a shipment of 288 bottles of acetaminophen last year to
CR Pharmacies and Laneco supermarkets around Phillipsburg and in
the Lehigh Valley area in eastern Pennsylvania.
