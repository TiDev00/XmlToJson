   An explosion and fire at a plastics
factory Thursday forced hundreds of people from their homes in this
southeastern Michigan town, and sent up to 14 people to the
hospital, authorities said.
   The fire at Sil-Tech Corp. began around 5 p.m. and was under
control by 10 p.m., said firefighter David Ousterhout.
   Between 500 and 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes for
several hours, said police Sgt. James Knierm.
   Between 10 and 14 people were treated at Herrick Memorial Health
Care Center for eye and skin irritation and released, said
Ousterhout.
   Smoke from the fire quickly dissipated, and no hazardous
substances leaked, said Bruce Van Wieren of the state Department of
Natural Resources.
   The cause of the blast and fire at the plant, which makes
silicone-based fluids and employs about 10 people, was unknown,
said Police Chief Laurence Van Alstine. No damage estimate was
available.

   Scientists today said they have identified what
may be the first step in the process that causes the most common
and severe form of muscular dystrophy.
   They found that human muscle cells affected by the disease
largely lack a protein normally found on the cell surface.
   Lack of that protein may permit the muscle destruction that
marks the disease, the scientists reported in the British journal
Nature.
   The work dealt with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a genetic
disorder that strikes boys almost exclusively, appearing in about
one in every 3,500 male births in the United States.
   It causes a progressive weakening and wasting of voluntary
muscles. Most patients must use wheelchairs by age 12, and most die
in their early 20s.
   The new work was done by Kevin Campbell and colleagues at the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and department of physiology and
biophysics at the University of Iowa College of Medicine.
   The researchers followed up a 1987 discovery that the basic
defect in muscles affected by Duchenne is the lack of a protein
called dystrophin. The protein is missing because of a flaw in the
gene that normally tells muscle cells how to produce it.
   At the time of the discovery, nobody knew what dystrophin
normally does in muscle cells, nor why its absence would cause the
disease.
   One puzzle was that dystrophin had no apparent connection to the
surface of muscle cells, where scientists knew that early
abnormalities occurred in Duchenne.
   The new work provides that connection, shedding important light
on the Duchenne disease process, said Dr. Salvatore DiMauro of
Columbia University in New York.
   Campbell and colleagues found that dystrophin is normally bound
to a complex of four proteins on the surface of muscle cells.
Dystrophin apparently acts to anchor the complex to cytoskeleton, a
region of fibrous material beneath the cell surface, Campbell said
in a telephone interview.
   Researchers were able to test for the presence of one of the
four surface proteins, and they found that muscle samples from
Duchenne patients contained only about 10 percent of normal levels.
Without its dystrophin anchor, the protein is probably destroyed by
the cell, Campbell said.
   The researchers have not yet been able to check levels of the
other proteins in the surface complex, he said. Perhaps the whole
complex is missing or disrupted in Duchenne cells, triggering the
death of muscle fibers, he said.

   If you ``beam up,'' you're not headed for the
starship Enterprise, you're getting high on crack. But if you're
``popping junk,'' you're not using heroin, you're gossiping.
   That's the word according to a dictionary of street slang
compiled so the city's beleaguered public school educators can
understand, and thus control, their highly colloquial and often
unruly students.
   Peter Commanday, an instructor in the schools' Division of
School Safety, says he began compiling ``Slang: Words and Terms''
when he was dean of discipline in a junior high school in the
city's South Bronx neighborhood.
   ``I didn't understand what I was hearing,'' he said Monday. When
kids greeted him, ``What's happenin'?'' he was so unhip, he'd
actually try to tell them.
   ``I had all these degrees and these kids were speaking to me and
I did not understand what they were saying,'' he said. ``But I
needed to know street slang, because that is the language of
violence, and that was my business.''
   The dictionary contains 221 words and expressions, from ``ain't
no thang'' (no problem) and ``audi'' (to run) through ``zimmer''
(girl) and ``zootie'' (high or crazy).
   The dictionary doesn't discuss the origin of the terms.
   It was compiled by Commanday and hundreds of graduates of
``Peacemaking: The Management of Confrontation,'' a course he
teaches for administrators, teachers and school security officers
interested in learning how to prevent and defuse school violence.
   The glossary is top-heavy with the language of drugs and
conflict, including ``shermed'' (high on PCP), ``cap'' (to hit) and
``base'' (argue).
   The glossary ranges from the old or obvious _ even Ozzie Nelson
knew ``dig'' means understand _ to the most obscure: ``popping
junk'' means gossiping. Some terms are used in only one part of the
city, others across the country.
   Since one purpose of slang is to exclude outsiders such as
parents and teachers, presumably a term's inclusion in Commanday's
dictionary renders it hopelessly passe among the experts. Slang
that was obscure only a few years ago, such as ``def'' (terrific,
real good, cool) and ``home boy'' (good friend, pal) already has
lost some of its cachet.
   Slang, in fact, becomes part of the language so fast that
Commanday uses slang to define slang. After reading that a
``bazooka'' is ``a joint laced with coca paste,'' a teacher _ OK, a
really naive teacher _ would have to flip to ``joint.'' But there
are three definitions: 1. marijuana; 2. jail; 3. a fight.
   Educators and other school personnel must understand the lingo
because much of the violence and other trouble in school begins
with talk. ``The human tongue,'' Commanday insists, ``is the most
volatile, dangerous weapon brought into a school building.''
   Commanday, 57, is a lean, graying 6-footer who says he broke up
1,000 fights and confiscated 400 weapons during 15 years' service
in the South Bronx. In his Board of Education classes and the
workshops he leads around the country, Commanday uses slang and
profanity to talk to and abuse educators ``just like the kids
would.'' But he says slang shouldn't be used to speak to students,
only to listen to them.
   When school personnel do speak to students, they often ``talk
dirty'' without ever cursing, according to Commanday. They're
likely to use what he calls ``the two dirtiest words in the
language _ `calm down.' It denies the validity of whatever has
upset the other person. ... You're dissing him _ showing
disrespect.''

   Burma, the isolated nation sometimes called the
``hermit of Asia,'' is about to hold its first multiparty election
in decades. Here is a report from Aye Aye Win, Associated Press
correspondent in Rangoon, to which AP correspondents in neighboring
Thailand contributed.

   Burma will hold its first multiparty
elections in 30 years Sunday, but two of the military regime's main
opponents are under house arrest and a third is in prison.
   Diplomats stationed in Rangoon have described the election as a
cynical exercise by heavy-handed military rulers, but some analysts
feel it will create a form of party politics that may evolve slowly
toward democracy.
   The military junta, which brutally suppressed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, has allowed scores of parties to form since and
promises the election will be free and fair.
   More than 2,300 candidates _ independents and representatives of
93 parties _ are running for the 485 parliament seats. Election
officials say 18,900 voting stations will be provided and ballots
will be counted in the presence of candidates' representatives.
   Critics point out that however scrupulous the attention to
election rules, most of Burma is under martial law, many opposition
politicians have been arrested and outsiders are not welcome.
   Burma has not approved applications by foreign correspondents to
report on the election and, on May 15, even stopped issuing visas
to tourists.
   ``There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of
assembly,'' said one diplomat in the Burmese capital, who like
others here would discuss the situation only if granted anonymity.
``Under those particular restrictions, it is already not a free and
fair election. It is farcical that those the people want to vote
for are not in the election.''
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the most popular opposition leader, was placed
under house arrest in July 1989 for alleged violations of security
laws. The other main leader of her National League for Democracy,
Tin Oo, is serving a three-year prison term.
   Former Prime Minister U Nu, Burma's last democratically elected
leader, was put under house arrest in December. U Nu, now 84, was
ousted in a 1962 coup led by Gen. Ne Win.
   Despite arrests of its leaders and some internal rifts, the
National League for Democracy is clearly the most popular party in
the election. It is one of six to enter candidates for more than
100 of the parliament seats.
   The party's popularity is due in large measure to Ms. Suu Kyi,
daughter of Burmese independence hero Aung San. She emerged as a
brave, charismatic leader during the democracy movement of 1988.
   The League and other parties have held some rallies, but their
focus is on party organization and door-to-door efforts rather than
public display.
   Security is tight in Rangoon, but Western diplomats do not
forsee a replay of the 1988 uprising, when soldiers shot down
several thousand demonstrators in the capital.
   Burma's numerous rebel groups, including students who fled the
repression, are known to have plans to disrupt voting in more
remote areas.
   The National League for Democracy's main opponent is the
National Unity Party, the richest and best organized political
group. It is the successor of the Burma Socialist Program Party,
the military-backed orgnization that controlled the country for 26
years and led it to economic ruin.
   Four other opposition parties are considered to have some
popular backing, but Burmese political analysts say none will win a
parliamentary majority unless the election is manipulated. That
means a coalition.
   The ruling military council, led by Gen. Saw Maung, has said it
will not relinquish power until a government is formed and a new
constitution written, which is expected to take some time.
   ``It's all set up; the government is going to pull all the
strings,'' Josef Silverstein, a leading American scholar on Burma,
said in an interview from the United States.
   ``I think they could tell you today what the vote is going to be
like. They're now trying to figure out how to divide the votes
among the parties.''
   Other foreign analysts stress pre-election maneuvering and
intimidation by the generals rather than possible rigging of the
vote.
   Amnesty International, the human rights group based in London,
accused Burmese authorities of rounding up hundreds of people,
possibly thousands, and said torture was widespread.
   Many diplomats believe one motive for relocating about 500,000
people from cities into the countryside was to have better control
of the election.
   ``There is no rule of law,'' one said. ``The big question is if
the Burmese will really dare vote for the opposition parties.''

   Scentists today reported the discovery of what
may be the ``missing link'' between human and certain primate
versions of the AIDS virus.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, the researchers
said.
   Genetic analysis of a recently found chimpanzee virus shows it
is more closely related to the human AIDS virus than it is to other
AIDS-related monkey viruses, scientists from Gabon and the Pasteur
Institute in Paris reported in the British journal nature.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in Gabon. It is
classified as a lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1,
which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United
States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said. They suggested it might be called chimpanzee
immunodeficiency virus.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   Further study may shed light on whether the AIDS virus
originated in people or came from an animal virus, a primate
specialist observed in an accompanying editorial.
   The virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the African
Old World primate viruses and the AIDS virus, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.

   Election day in Burma will be the 312th
day of house arrest for a former housewife and academic who most
analysts believe could lead her party to victory if she were free
do to so.
   Until two years ago, Aung San Suu Kyi was virtually unknown.
Today, she is the country's most popular political figure.
   When the gemerals put her under house arrest July 20, 1989, they
hoped to silence their most vocal critic. It didn't work.
   ``She has now become more or less a martyr figure,'' said a
Burmese expatriate in Bangkok. ``She embodies everything the
Burmese people aspire to.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, is graceful and articulate. She emerged as the
star of Burma's hazardous political stage less than two years ago,
at the height of a national uprising for democracy that was
brutally crushed.
   Her father, Aung San, is revered in Burma as the leader of the
movement for independence from British rule. He was assassinated in
1947 and Burma achieved formal independence Jan. 4, 1948.
   Other dissidents were cowed into silence by the army's ferocity,
but Ms. Suu Kyi refused to bow to the junta that took control in
September 1988.
   Soldiers killed thousands of dissidents that year and thousands
more have been arrested since. Ms. Suu Kyi said she sometimes was
threatened, but she continued criticizing the junta's human rights
abuses and campaigning for democracy.
   She is the antithesis of Ne Win, the reclusive general who ruled
Burma from 1962 to 1988, and is the only Burmese politician who has
dared attack him openly.
   ``Everyone knows who was responsible for all the bad things in
Burma, but she was the first to blame Ne Win,'' said a Burmese.
``No one had the guts to do that before.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi had lived abroad since she was 15 and happened into
politics by chance when she returned home to nurse her dying mother.
   She studied at Oxford University and married an English academic
in 1972. Later, she began an academic career of her own and worked
for the United Nations.
   The political program of her National League for Democracy is
vague, but Ms. Suu Kyi has referred in many speeches to the
non-violent liberation movements led by Mohandas K. Gandhi of India
and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.
   Before her detention, tens of thousands of people defied martial
law and heavily armed soldiers to hear her speak.
   After being put under house arrest, she began a hunger strike to
demand humane treatment for imprisoned supporters. She took only
liquids for nearly two weeks, until the government gave guarantees.
   ``Martin Luther King said to the people `I have a dream','' she
told a reporter last year. ``Well, it is the same with us. We just
want to bring our dreams to reality.''

   A federal judge on Thursday threw out a deal for
the government to pay Manuel Noriega's heavy legal fees, setting up
a showdown over $20 million in assets confiscated from the deposed
Panamanian dictator.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said federal law on defense
spending limits would not permit the $250- to $350-an-hour fee for
each of Noriega's five attorneys in the drug trafficking case. The
federal cap is $60-to $75-an-hour for only one attorney, the judge
said.
   The failure of the agreement reached Monday means the U.S.
attorney's office must quickly justify the U.S. government's
seizure of 27 accounts linked to Noriega, who claims he has no
money for his legal defense.
   ``We do have a constitutional due-process problem and I think we
recognize that,'' said Hoeveler.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen suggested the judge could declare
the spending cap unconstitutional, but noted the prosecution had
taken no position supporting or opposing the higher fees wanted by
the defense.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said it was absurd for the
government to expect one defense attorney to handle the complex
Noriega case. Defense team members had threatened to withdraw
because they weren't being paid for their work.
   Rubino noted that up to two dozen federal prosecutors were
working to convict Noriega and intend to spend almost $40 million
in their effort.
   ``I think in all sincerity and honesty it would make a mockery
of due process,'' said Rubino. ``I find that to be ludicrous.''
   Claiming Noriega had income not linked to drugs, Rubino said
Noriega had his army salary, legitimate business interests in
Panama and $11 million in secret payments from U.S. intelligence
agencies.
   An angry Rubino accused the government of sandbagging the
defense, in effect declaring legal war on the prosecutors.
   ``We shall litigate every dime Gen. Noriega's been paid by this
government, and we shall litigate it as publicly as we possibly
can,'' Rubino said.
   Lehtinen confirmed Thursday that his office submitted a ledger
of U.S. government payments to Noriega. The prosecution maintains
that amount is significantly less than the defense estimates.
   Hoeveler agreed to quickly settle the defense payment dispute.
   Lehtinen argued the prosecution was handicapped by foreign
governments' claims on Noriega's assets and because Noriega has
never admitted to earning the money.
   The U.S. attorney noted that $5.8 million seized in Noriega's
quarters in Panama has been handed over to the new Panamanian
government.
   But the defense claims the U.S. government had no right to give
that money to Panamanian authorities without a full legal hearing.
   The deal for the government to pay Noriega legal fees began to
unravel when attorneys questioned the plan, saying there were no
provisions for it under federal law.
   Almost as soon as the deal was announced, Michael O'Kane, a
defense attorney for Noriega co-defendent Daniel Miranda, wrote the
U.S. comptroller of the currency demanding he determine if the
payments were proper.
   The conservative Washington Legal Foundation also wrote Hoeveler
protesting the fees.
   U.S. Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., also denounced the deal.
   Noriega is jailed in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside of Miami, where he was taken after surrendering to U.S.
troops in Panama on Jan. 4, two weeks after they invaded the
country.
   He is charged in a February 1988 indictment with turning Panama
into a way station for Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, accepting
$4.6 million in bribes to allow them to process and ship cocaine to
the United States through his country.

   The founder and leader of a Hare
Krishna community was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday in
an alleged scheme to murder, kidnap and beat his followers,
authorities said.
   Keith Ham, 54, also known as Kirthanananda Swami Bhaktipada, was
named on five counts of racketeering and conspiracy to commit
murder and six counts of mail fraud. The indictment was handed up
by a special grand jury in Elkins.
   One of the racketeering counts alleges a conspiracy involving
the death of Stephen Bryant, a dissident member of the Krishna
community who was shot on a Los Angeles street in May 1986.
   Thomas A. Drescher, a former resident of Bhaktipada's New
Vrindaban community in Marshall County, has been charged with
Bryant's murder and is awaiting trial in Los Angeles.
   Bryant was killed after he launched a one-man crusade against
New Vrindaban, accusing Bhaktipada and other commune leaders of
drug trafficking, prostitution and child abuse.
   Bhaktipada was expelled in 1987 from the mainstream Hare Krishna
movement, which is cooperating with authorities investigating the
community, said Ravindra Svarupa, leader of the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness in Philadelphia.
   Ravindra called Bhaktipada's community a splinter group and said
he was expelled for violating principles established by Hare
Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
   ``They've deeply embarrassed us in many ways,'' Ravindra said.
   The international society oversees 46 Hare Krishna centers in
the United States and Canada. There are more than 250 Hare Krishna
centers worldwide, said spokesman Mukunda Goswami.
   Bhaktipada was in Bombay, India, on Thursday and not immediately
available for comment, according to Gadadhar Das, a New Vrindaban
spokesman.
   ``Bhaktipada will return to West Virginia within the next few
days; that's all I can say,'' Gadadhar said.
   U.S. Attorney William Kolibash said the indictment was the
result of a two-year probe into the community, which once was among
the largest Krishna communities in the United States.
   He refused to discuss details of the indictment until a news
conference Friday in Wheeling.
   Bhaktipada, the son of a Baptist minister, founded New
Vrindaban, located about 80 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, among
the hills outside of Moundsville 21 years ago.
   At one time in the early 1980s, his permanent devotees at the
compound numbered about 700, Gadadhar said.
   Also named in the indictment were Terry Sheldon, 31, also known
as Mr. Scam and Tapahpunja; Steven Fitzpatrick, 36, also known as
Sundarakara; New Vrindaban Community Inc.; Govardhan Inc.; and the
Cathedral of Healing Inc.
   The indictment alleges that Bhaktipada, Sheldon and others
``have engaged in numerous acts of racketeering and other criminal
acts to protect Keith Gordon Ham (Bhaktipada) and themselves from
internal opponents, and to demonstrate to (Bhaktipada's) devotees
that (Bhaktipada) had and would exercise ultimate power over his
devotees.
   ``Accordingly, defendant Keith Gordon Ham ... has authorized
murders, kidnappings, and beatings of devotees,'' the indictment
said.
   ``Moreover, in addition to instructing devotees to commit mail
frauds, Keith Gordon Ham has also commanded devotees to impede law
enforcement investigations related to the New Vrindaban Community.''

<HEAD>Second Dolphin Dies After Rescue from Thames in London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second dolphin has died after being rescued from
the Thames River in central London, police said today.
   The female dolphin is believed to be the mother of the young
male dolphin that died Tuesday despite rescue attempts, said
Richard Paterson, a spokesman for the River Police.
   ``It was obviously in a very poor condition,'' Paterson said.
``It could hardly move.''
   Veterinarian John Taylor said the first dolphin died from
pneumonia and skin damage caused by lengthy exposure to fresh water.
   Taylor said the dolphins may have made the 40-mile trip from the
sea in pursuit of salmon, which have returned to the cleaned-up
Thames after a 145-year absence. Porpoises were seen in the Thames
last week.

   Alex is 13 going on 2{ and talks numbers,
colors and even turkey with his trainer, a researcher who hopes her
work with the African gray parrot someday may help autistic
children.
   In conversation with trainer Irene Pepperberg of Northwestern
University, Alex's lexicon includes 80 of his favorite things and
some of his not-so-favorite.
   Alex mimicks her Boston accent, spewing comments that recall Big
Bird's wise-guy chattering, Oscar the Grouch's grumbling, E.T.'s
longing for home.
   One moment Alex is humble as the next parrot, saying simply,
``Wanna cracker.'' The next moment, he might be brassier,
declaring, ``You're a turkey!,'' possibly when some human tries his
patience.
   Ms. Pepperberg, a visiting assistant professor of anthropology,
works eight hours a day training the bird, of a species known for
its ability to mimic a huge variety of sounds.
   Alex is no bird-brain. His remarks and responses seem
appropriate to the situation.
   For instance, when hungry, he might mumble lazily, ``Wanna
cracker.''
   Offered a choice of corn, a grape or a nut, during recent visit,
Alex knew the difference. With the demanding tone of an old man who
gets everything from his slippers to his supper catered, Alex
declared, ``I want cracker.''
   But does the parrot really know what he's saying?
   Alex's speech isn't language and ``I'm not trying to claim it
is,'' Ms. Pepperberg said.
   ``He has the ability to reproduce the sounds of speech. He
understands the concepts,'' she said. For instance, he uses words
like ``rock'' and ``key'' when he can't see the object, but seems
to want it.
   The parrot began saying, ``You're a turkey,'' in situations
where Ms. Pepperberg believes he is frustrated after hearing
frustrated students use the expression.
   She said the technique she uses to train Alex might someday be
used with children, including the autistic, who fail to form
relationships with others.
   ``The idea of understanding how another form of intelligence
works will help us understand how all forms of intelligence
works,'' she said Wednesday.
   Thomas Zentall, a University of Kentucky psychology professor,
has researched animal cognition. Pepperberg's procedures ``may be
the critical way in which (autistic) children learn language,'' he
said.
   Researchers now don't know how children normally learn language
skills and don't know how to teach those who have trouble
communicating, he said.
   Ms. Pepperberg uses a modeling technique: Alex watches as she
shows objects such as toys, keys, paper or nails to a student and
pronounces the word. The student repeats the word and is rewarded
with the object.
   Then she takes Alex through the procedure, rewarding him each
time he succeeds.
   She asks how many keys she's holding.
   ``Two,'' Alex correctly replies.
   She holds two objects _ one square; the other, round. ``What's
different?''
   ``Shape,'' he responds.
   But sometimes a testy Alex emerges. Bored with the same old
games, he skips the right answer as he spills off a list of colors,
or retorts, ``you tell me what color.''
   ``These birds have the personality of a 2{-year-old,'' said Ms.
Pepperburg. ``He obviously has a short attention span'' _ evidenced
by the keys, rocks, grapes and nuts he's strewn over her laboratory
floor.
   Among Alex's simple sentences:
   _ ``I want showah'' _ to be sprayed with water.
   _ ``I want to go back'' _ indicating a yearning to return to his
cage, where Alex prances along the edges as if he were a high-wire
acrobat, whistles a loud, if not pretty, tune, nervously scratches
his feathers, and watches to make sure he has an attentive audience.
   Zentall noted researchers' reluctance to describe Alex's skills
as language. ``We haven't really developed a good definition of
language,'' he said. ``Humans do it, and animals don't, and now
animals are infringing on this.''

<DATELINE>NEURUPPIN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this village are
tired of the screeching and thundering from the Soviet military air
base in their midst, and they are waging a lively campaign to get
it closed.
   A Soviet warplane that accidentally dropped three bombs on a
neighboring village has added new fuel to the 2{-year-old campaign,
which has gone public since the fall of East Germany's Communist
regime.
   Thousands of demonstrators converged at the airfield this week,
and a protest letter to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
soon be on its way.
   ``We think it's shocking that despite huge political changes,
war is still being waged over our town,'' said Pastor Heinz Joachim
Karau, who organized Monday's protest of between 5,000 and 8,000
residents _ estimates vary.
   More than 7,200 people have signed a petition demanding closure
of the base in Neuruppin, home to 22,000 people and about an hour's
drive northwest of Berlin.
   While government leaders debate the likely pullout of U.S. and
Soviet troops from central Europe, residents of Neuruppin say noise
from the Soviet base has driven them crazy for years.
   Windows rattle, houses shake, hospital patients are frightened.
One doctor said children are subjected to possible mental
disturbances from the fighter jet and helicopter noise.
   ``They say this is one of the noisiest areas in all of Europe,''
said 61-year-old Guenter Knoerr, a retired butcher.
   Knoerr, his son-in-law and his grandchildren were among those
who took part in the protest at the base, which is just outside the
town center.
   ``When the MiGs started up, the kids came screaming into the
house,'' said another protester who used to live next to the base.
   During the demonstration, about 150 people raced onto the
runway, where they briefly confronted Soviet soldiers. The march
included mothers pushing baby carriages and young children riding
on their fathers' shoulders.
   ``We live right near the airfield, and we just can't stand it.
The windows rattle when the planes go by. We can't even really
watch television,'' said Knoerr's 63-year-old wife, Marga.
   On Wednesday, a Soviet warplane swooped in for a landing just
above a moderately busy street.
   Residents are well aware their protests would have landed them
in jail as recently as last fall.
   A massive secret police network kept residents in check under
the regime of former Communist Party boss Erich Honecker, ousted in
October's peaceful revolution.
   Before Honecker's fall, Neuruppin residents worked out a scheme
to make their longstanding grievances known. Since petitions to the
government were forbidden, in December 1987 churchgoers wrote to
their pastors.
   The clerics then passed the letters of protest to the local
Soviet commander, who responded with a one-page letter offering no
hope of change.
   ``We thought it was all in vain,'' said Lutheran Church Pastor
Karau in his cluttered study, with a large crucifix on the wall.
   Then, four days after the Berlin Wall opened in November, 10,000
people gathered for a protest march.
   That was followed by another march in January, when protesters
hung banners saying ``Ivan, aren't you homesick?'' and
``Playgrounds instead of landing grounds.''
   Monday's demonstration came just four days after bombs were
accidentally dropped on the neighboring village of Raegelin. No one
was injured, and the bombs did not explode, but two of them ripped
through a barn roof and a third slammed to the ground near a lake
where young people were sitting.
   Soviet officials said the accident was due to an electrical
failure.
   ``The bombs fell at just the right time,'' said Karau, 62. ``The
demonstrators were really fired up.''
   He said that so far, the Soviets have only trimmed back the
number of late- night flights. The aircraft land and take off from
6 a.m. until midnight, residents said.
   ``The airfield would be a great place for huge rock 'n' roll
youth festival,'' Karau said with a smile.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A surge in violent crime by armed
gangs is spreading fear among Haitians and threatening the new
civilian government's plans for democratic elections this year.
   ``We are not going to go blindly to the ballot box. We must have
a minimum of security,'' said Emmanuel Ambroise, human rights
representative on the nine-member Electoral Council organizing the
vote.
   The crime wave, which erupted the weekend before the Electoral
Council was installed May 2, is likely to be one of the items
discussed when President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot meets Thursday with
President Bush at the White House.
   The surge in violence may threaten democratic reform _ a
condition for the resumption of full U.S. aid to the impoverished
Caribbean nation.
   Congress suspended $60 million in annual aid after the last
attempt to hold independent presidential elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, collapsed in a bloodbath. Thugs in collusion with the army
shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has pledged democratic elections as soon
as they can be arranged, possibly by September. She took office as
head of a caretaker government March 13 after military ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril fled into exile following widespread protests of
his government.
   The elections, if carried out, would give Haiti its first
democratically elected president in its 186-year history.
   But the crime wave is undermining confidence in the government's
ability to provide security during the vote.
   Heavily armed gangs, sometimes as many as eight in a group, have
been brazenly holding up stores during the day and breaking into
houses and robbing motorists at night.
   Gunfire is heard almost nightly. Piles of flaming tires send
foul-smelling smoke billowing into the air, poisoning the
atmosphere. Anti-government graffiti has begun to crop up.
   A restaurant owner in the affluent suburb of Petionville said
people seem afraid to go out at night. The last weekend in April,
business was so good he was turning people away at the door, ``and
then people got scared.''
   Only about four tables of several dozen were occupied the night
he spoke.
   The violence recalls an army terror campaign in the months
leading up to the 1987 election day massacre.
   ``It is not easy to mobilize a people for elections when
elections immediately conjure up the idea of a massacre,'' said
Louis Dejoie Jr., a prominent politician who has called for a
special police task force and international supervision of the
elections.
   ``Every time there is a glimmer of democratic hope, the enemies
of democracy try to put it out,'' said Dr. Louis Roy, co-author of
Haiti's 1987 constitution and president of a 19-member Council of
State. It governs along with Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former
Supreme Court justice.
   When Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was inaugurated, the army's chief of
staff, Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham, publicly placed the military under
her command.
   But doubt persists that the undisciplined, 6,000-man force will
give up the privileges acquired under successive military regimes
since the ouster of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986.
   Although some of the crime may not be politically motivated,
many believe the army is doing little to prevent it.
   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a radical Roman Catholic priest
with a huge following among the poor, said the crime wave only
confirmed his suspicion that the army opposes democratic elections.
   Police officials in the capital of Port-au-Prince say their
ill-equipped, 800-man force cannot guarantee security in a city of
1 million inhabitants.
   Crime in the countryside goes largely unpunished and is often
committed by government officials in collusion with army agents.
The Council of State has called for reform of the rural police
system constantly denounced by peasant groups as repressive.
   The government meanwhile is faced with an economy battered by
corruption and mismanagement under the 18-month Avril regime.
   An expected budget deficit of $1.2 million turned out be $21
million. The new government was forced to cut $13 million from this
year's $290 million budget.
   During its first two months in power, the Pascal-Trouillot
government has received about $71 million in loans and gifts from
international donors.
   The U.S. government, encouraged by democratic reform and
progress on human rights, has granted $18 million in the Food for
Peace Program, but only $6 million will be available before
October. The State Department has urged Congress to give $13
million more, $3 million of which is to be used for election
monitors.

<HEAD>It's in Your Genes: Some Gain Weight More Easily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All in the name of science, 24 young men sat
around a college dormitory for 3{ months and watched TV, played
cards and ate.
   And ate. And ate.
   When it was over, they had provided some of the clearest
evidence yet of one of nature's injustices: Some people can overeat
without putting on much weight. But for others, every extra calorie
goes straight to the waistline.
   Moreover, the study suggested a reason why. And it strengthened
the case that heredity plays a major role in whether people get fat.
   It seems that some people's bodies store extra calories mostly
as fat, while others tend to make new muscle. And because
manufacturing lean tissue is not a very energy efficient process,
the muscle makers put on less weight.
   The men tested were 12 sets of identical twins. Six of every
seven days for 100 days, each of them ate 1,000 more calories than
their bodies need.
   Some put on three times as much weight as others.
   The twins are genetically identical, and this similarity was
reflected in the way they added weight. If one twin put on a lot of
weight, so did his brother. The study found three times more
variation in weight gain among pairs than within pairs.
   There were also similarities in the way twins deposited their
fat, whether they tended to grow potbellies or big bottoms.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Claude Bouchard at Laval
University in Ste. Foy, Quebec. It was published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine, along with another study on twins by
Dr. Albert J. Stunkard and others at the University of Pennsylvania.
   An editorial by Dr. Ethan A.H. Sims of the University of Vermont
described the two reports as ``landmark contributions.'' He said
they show that ``destiny, in the form of our genetic makeup, has a
great deal to do with the shape of our middles.''
   In the Laval study, the man who gained the most weight put on 29
pounds and stored up every extra calorie somewhere on his body. The
man who gained the least added nine pounds and stored only 40
percent of the extra calories.
   ``It demonstrates for the first time that for a given amount of
calories, you have differences in the body's response to the
surplus of energy,'' said Bouchard. ``The individual differences
are amazing. They are huge.''
   He said almost 40 percent of the weight gain is explained by the
individual's propensity to store calories in lean tissue or in fat.
   ``This is the single most important variable that has been
presented in the literature to account for differences in weight
gain,'' he said.
   The Pennsylvania research examined 673 sets of identical and
fraternal twins in Sweden. About half of the sets were raised
together. The rest had been separated at birth.
   The researchers found that genes could explain most of the
difference in people's weights, although there was a slight sex
difference. Genetic influences accounted for 70 percent of the
differences in fatness among men and 66 percent in women.
   Their childhood home environments had no effect at all on
whether they grew up to be heavy or slim. Four years ago, the same
group found that twins who had been put up for adoption grew to
have the body builds of their biological parents, not the people
who raised them.

   New York's Republican leaders, still without
a candidate a week before their convention, turned Wednesday to two
familiar Wall Street figures as potential challengers to Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   Investment counselor John Loeb Jr. and economist Pierre Rinfret
both were approached by party kingmakers.
   The New York Times reported in its Thursday editions that
Rinfret was the choice of GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett and a
group of party leaders. Party officials weren't available late
Wednesday to confirm the report they had decided to back Rinfret
for the nomination.
   Rinfret said through a spokeswoman that he had yet to accept the
offer of leadership support in a bid to carry the party's banner
against Cuomo, a two-term Democrat.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 presidential contender, is
expected to announce his re-election bid within days. The state
Democratic convention begins a week from Monday.
   The GOP convention opens May 29.
   Rinfret, who was an unpaid economic adviser to presidents
Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon in the 1960s and 1970s, heads Rinfret
Associates, an economic consulting firm in New York City.
   A spokeswoman for the 66-year-old economist said nothing
definite had been decided.
   ``As far as he's concerned, there are still issues to be
discussed,'' Debbie Ishlon said late Wednesday night. ``It's not
definitely determined that he would be a candidate.''
   Ishlon said Rinfret has spoken to state Sen. Roy Goodman of
Manhattan and Barrett about running against Cuomo. ``He has
expressed an interest,'' she said, ``but there are still many
issues that they are discussing.''
   Loeb said Wednesday he's ``been having conversations with the
leaders of the Republican Party'' about running for governor.
   Loeb, who served as former President Reagan's ambassador to
Copenhagen from 1981-83, said he hadn't decided whether he wanted
to seek the nomination.
   An aide to state GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett said her boss
had met with Loeb on Wednesday in New York City.
   ``Pat found him to be very intelligent and articulate,'' said
Barrett aide Elizabeth DelTorto of Loeb.
   Barrett has been searching for almost a year to find a credible
Cuomo opponent. Thus far, he's been turned down by one well-known
Republican after another.
   The latest Republican to keep his hat out of the ring is former
state GOP Chairman Richard Rosenbaum.
   ``I'm not going to do it,'' the Rochester lawyer said Wednesday.
   Rosenbaum said he wouldn't run, in large part, because he didn't
have the $5 million he said was the minimum needed to mount a
credible campaign.
   ``That's a million dollars a month to raise. That's a monumental
task,'' he said.
   Loeb, the son of a wealthy banker and financier, has money and
some knowledge of New York state government. He served as a special
adviser on environmental matters to then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
from 1967-73.
   Loeb, 60, said he was ``very honored to be one of several being
considered for the nomination.''
   ``Aha, 25 million (dollars)! They made the phone call,'' said
Cuomo when told about Loeb. ``I told you that if I run, I have to
go out and get a lot of money because they will come up with a
fortune.''
   Cuomo, who already has more than $7 million in his campaign war
chest, has long maintained that Republicans will raise at least $25
million to defeat him this year.
   Cuomo made the same claim in 1986. That year, however,
Republican candidate Andrew O'Rourke was able to raise only $1.3
million. Cuomo, spending $6.8 million, easily won re-election to a
second term.
   At the moment, the only announced candidate for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination is little-known Rockland County insurance
broker Herbert Holland. He has never run for office before and has
little support among the state's GOP leadership. Holland has
proposed, among other things, that all New Yorkers be tested for
drugs when they seek to renew their driver's licenses.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's trip to Japan
has stirred up hard feelings from Japan's militaristic past,
sentiments that extend throughout much of Asia's Pacific rim.
   A major aim of the three-day state visit, which began early
Thursday with Roh's arrival, is to ease past animosities. But the
trip has provoked debate over Japan's lingering responsibility for
its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.
   Japanese extremist groups opposed to Roh have set off explosives
to destroy Korean buildings and cars owned by Japanese government
officials.
   In Seoul, protests against Roh's visit culminated Wednesday in a
ritual suicide attempt. A 34-year-old man demanding the Japanese
emperor apologize for Japan's past actions stabbed himself outside
the Japanese Embassy. Hospital officials said the man was in stable
condition.
   Bands of elderly Koreans protest daily outside the embassy in
Seoul, demanding compensation for the hundreds of thousands of
Koreans who were forced to fight and work for wartime Japan.
   Elsewhere in Asia, too, memories of hardships under Japanese
rule still hinder efforts to leave the past behind. Such lingering
bitterness would make it hard for Japan to claim a leading
political role in the region _ despite its great wealth.
   ``According to international law, Japan's legal responsibility
for the war has been fulfilled,'' said Kisaburo Yokota, a law
professor at the International Christian University in Tokyo. ``But
especially in Korea, as well as China and other countries, public
feelings are still strong. They feel Japan hasn't reflected
thoroughly on its past actions.''
   Japanese power struck first in Korea before World War II.
Japan's military empire extended from Manchuria to Burma, through
Southeast Asia to the Philippines in the South Pacific and to the
Aleutians.
   South Korean officials have said they expect a clear apology for
Japan's colonial rule, preferably from Emperor Akihito, during
Roh's visit.
   But for Japan, such an apology would raise questions about the
emperor's role under the postwar constitution and about how much
responsibility Akihito's father, the late Emperor Hirohito, had for
Japan's wartime actions.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, in remarks to Parliament, has
characterized Japan as the aggressor in the war and vowed to
``express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and apologize
for them.''
   But some governing party politicians said Japan should not
``prostrate itself'' in apology. Their views are shared by
right-wing extremists, who glorify the imperial family and view the
demand for an apology as an insult.
   The division of the Korean peninsula is a legacy of Japan's
colonization, and Roh's visit gave Communist North Korea a chance
to blast him for bringing ``shame and humiliation to our nation.''
   Much as the two Germanys' relations with other European
countries are affected by lingering memories of World War II,
Japan's legacy of aggression has left wounds in Asia.
   Japanese officials often seem torn, however, over the need to
balance sensitivity with national pride.
   The government has heard repeated Asian protests over
euphemistic descriptions of wartime atrocities in history
textbooks, and several Cabinet members have been forced to resign
after defending Japan's militaristic past.
   Japan was reluctant to criticize China after the harsh crackdown
in June on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. The reason given by
Japanese officials was Japan's invasion of China 50 years ago.
   Tokyo's relations with Seoul are complicated by discriminatory
treatment of 680,000 Koreans living in Japan, many of them
descendants of forced laborers.
   Japanese officials have said they hoped the visit, only the
second by a South Korean leader, would allow them to put the past
well behind them.
   But analysts say that apologies and agreements will not halt the
antagonism.
   ``It's an emotional problem, so it will take time to resolve
it,'' Yokota said. ``That's why it's so important for Japan to do
all it can to resolve it as soon as possible.''

   An inexperienced spelunker spent seven
hours trapped under a waterfall 200 feet underground in the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park before being rescued Wednesday night.
   Dozens of rescuers worked for nearly three hours before carrying
John Moscheo, 23, out of Bulls Cave near Cades Cove in the park. He
was airlifted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Dr.
Robert Lash of the university's Lifestar helicopter service said
the Knoxville man had no serious injuries.
   ``He's in remarkably good condition considering the amount of
hypothermia and stress he has been exposed to.''
   Lash said the long period he spent sitting on a ledge under a
waterfall caused the hypothermia.
   Moscheo had been caving with an experienced spelunker,
21-year-old Tim Massincupp, Wednesday, but he was unable to climb
up from the ledge.
   It took rescuers from the Blount County Sheriff's Department to
extract him from the cave.

   Swing Era clarinetist Artie Shaw marked his
80th birthday by taking a swipe at the current music scene.
   ``Now, Madonna goes out there in a jock strap and that's called
music. It isn't music,'' Shaw said Wednesday during a City Council
tribute to the jazz legend, who reached his commercial peak in 1938
with ``Begin the Beguine.''
   ``He's one of the all-time talents,'' said Councilman Ernani
Bernardi, a jazz afficionado who called Shaw's music ``absolutely
timeless, priceless stuff _ far superior to what people listen to
today.''
   Council President John Ferraro said Shaw's works ``may not be
well known to Madonna fans, but they are still favorites of people
of my generation.''

corporate executives.
   The singer, songwriter and activist mixed song, poetry and a
save-the-Earth message in an address Tuesday to corporate real
estate executives and developers at the Industrial Development
Research Council's 1990 World Congress.
   He blamed greed and corporate shortsightedness for various
threats to the planet, then was caught off guard by a standing
ovation from the audience of more than 1,200.
   ``I was shocked _ very surprised,'' said Denver, 46. ``I think

   Washington Mayor Marion Barry says he was
inspired by what he saw during a tour of a drug treatment center
here.
   Barry, who faces 14 drug charges, spent more than four hours
Tuesday with patients and staff members at the Black Alcohol-Drug
Abuse Service Information Center. The outpatient program aimed at
blacks claims an 85 percent success rate.
   ``I'm inspired already,'' Barry said.
   Oval Miller, the program's director, said he invited Barry
because he knew the mayor was interested in starting a similar
program in Washington.
   Barry is charged with cocaine possession and lying to a grand
jury about drug use. After his arrest in February, he spent seven
weeks in treatment for what he said was abuse of alcohol and
prescription drugs.

   Richard Harris says he was so tense before the
opening of his first West End stage appearance in 25 years that he
was almost physically ill.
   Harris, 59, won the audience at London's Wyndham Theatre on
Wednesday with a performance in Pirandello's ``Henry IV.'' But
before the curtain went up, he had a classic case of jitters.
   ``I was very tense. I thought, `Oh God, what if I let everyone
down and I just threw up,''' he said. ``I felt a great deal of
nervousness but I just knew I had to get out there and do it.''
   Harris plays a wealthy 20th century man who bangs his head and
believes he is the 11th century German king. For 20 years his
friends and servants join in his fantasy by turning his home into a
replica of the period.

   Elizabeth Taylor, recovering from a
near-fatal bout of pneumonia, may be able to leave the hospital
early next month, her doctor says.
   Dr. Michael Roth said Wednesday the 58-year-old actress is
significantly improved and in good spirits in her seventh week of
hospitalization.
   Miss Taylor was placed on a respirator last month, and doctors
said she was near death. She rallied, however, and was moved from
the intensive care unit to a fourth floor hospital suite early this
month.

   Gerald Arpino has decided to stay on as the
Joffrey Ballet's artistic director, the company announced.
   Arpino quit May 1 and withdrew his works and those of the
company's founder from the Joffrey's repertoire after the ballet
board of directors voted to set up a committee to run the company
in place of Arpino and the board.
   Ten board members resigned over what one member called a
takeover by businessmen ignorant of artistic matters.
   Arpino's resignation was never accepted by the board.
   In a statement, the company said Arpino and the committee had
settled their differences.
   The Joffrey was founded by Arpino and Robert Joffrey in 1956.
Arpino became artistic director after Joffrey's death in 1988.

   They die on lonely streets, in shelters and in
empty apartments, with no friends or kin to shed tears of grief.
   But thanks to Earl Lewis, the hundreds of men and women who die
penniless, homeless or friendless each year in Cook County are
honored in a memorial service designed to add dignity to their
deaths.
   ``I'm just a concerned Christian citizen who feels that more
recognition should be given to the unknown and forgotten members of
our community,'' Lewis said before Wednesday's service.
   The names of 170 men and women who died forgotten over the past
seven months were read during a service at the Chicago Temple, a
United Methodist church.
   ``We come today to remember the names of those who died unknown
to anybody but God,'' the Rev. Eugene Winkler, the temple's pastor,
said to open the 45-minute service.
   About 130 people attended. Among them was Ruth Reinhardt, a
30-year-old businesswoman.
   ``If you can take half an hour or 45 minutes to think about it
... and pray for the situation, maybe it will get better,'' she
said.
   Lewis, an administrative assistant for an insurance agency,
wouldn't say what led him to create the services, but he hinted
he's known hard times.
   ``I know what it means to feel as though you've been forgotten,
you don't matter, you don't belong,'' he said.
   The Cook County medical examiner's office provides Lewis with
the names of those whose bodies aren't claimed after about two
months. It also pays for a mass burial held every other month at a
cemetery in suburban Homewood.
   Many of the forgotten have died on the streets from exposure or
other effects of a hard life. Others outlive their relatives and
friends and die at home of old age with no money for a proper
burial, said Winkler.
   Since Lewis organized Chicago's first memorial five years ago,
when about 50 people were honored, the number of people
memorialized twice a year at area churches has more than tripled.
   Les Brown, executive director of the non-profit Coalition for
the Homeless, said about 40,000 people became destitute and
homeless in Chicago in the past 12 months, and the number is
increasing about 25 percent a year.
   ``Many of them are basically alone or have lost contact with
loved ones and friends. And many of them end up without any ritual
passing at all,'' Brown said. ``And that's a very sad commentary on
what this society does with its disenfranchised.''

<HEAD>Quadriplegic Fears Being Left Alone, Seeks Court Approval to Die</HEAD>

   A man who has spent 20 years as a quadriplegic
hooked to a respirator wants to be allowed to die because he fears
his adopted father and sole caretaker will go first.
   Kenneth A. Bergstedt, 31, whose 65-year-old adopted father has
high blood pressure and other ailments, has asked a state court to
let doctors unhook him from his life-support system.
   His attorney, Jack Cherry, said Bergstedt fears being
institutionalized.
   ``What would happen to him then?'' he said.
   ``His quality of life is zero,'' Cherry said. ``Lying on a
gurney for 20 years and only being able to move your head is a
terrible way to live.''
   Cherry said he will present witnesses at a June 8 hearing to
show that Bergstedt is mentally competent and will never regain use
of his body.
   The lawyer said he wants a judge to declare that Bergstedt has a
right to refuse life-sustaining treatment and that his decision
will not be regarded as suicide. He is also asking for a
declaration that anyone who helps him shut off the respirator or
gives him a sedative will not be prosecuted.
   The district attorney's office has said it won't argue against
Bergstedt's wishes. ``It's our conclusion that it's a decision that
has to be made between a patient and a doctor,'' said Bill Koot,
chief of the office's criminal division.
   In court papers, Bergstedt said he is afraid his father, who has
cared for him around the clock since his adopted mother died 12
years ago, will die and leave him alone.
   He said he is also afraid his life-support system will
malfunction someday when no one is around, causing an ``agonizing,
suffocating death.''
   Cherry described both men as ``very private people'' who have
declined to speak publicly about their plight. ``The father is very
supportive of his son and will go along with whatever his son wants
to do,'' the attorney said.
   Bergstedt said he severed his spinal cord at age 10 when a young
girl doing a ``cannonball'' dive landed on him in a public swimming
pool in Indiana.
   He said he has ``no happy or encouraging expectations to look
for from life, receives no enjoyment from life, lives with constant
fears and apprehensions, and is tired of suffering.''
   His entertainment consists of reading, watching television or
writing poetry on a computer controlled by puffs of breath.

<HEAD>Bush's Election-Year Encounter With Civil Rights And Environmental
Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is grappling with a pair of
domestic policy decisions _ one on offshore oil and the other on
civil rights _ seen as tests of his true commitment to a ``kinder
and gentler America.''
   In both cases Bush is faced with taking aggressive actions _
allowing or blocking coastal oil drilling, and signing or vetoing
civil rights legislation _ that will force him from the
fence-straddling stance he has thus far embraced.
   How Bush handles these election-year issues also promises
political ramifications for his administration, which has made a
concerted effort to convert two key constituency groups _
environmentalists and blacks.
   Bush's decision is expected within days on whether to open three
areas for offshore oil exploration, one off south Florida and two
off northern and southern California.
   At the same time, he is consulting advisers and interest groups
on how to handle the pending Civil Rights Act of 1990, written to
thwart six Supreme Court job discrimination decisions that were
seen as weakening earlier civil rights advances.
   In both cases, the phrase ``litmus test'' has been applied to
characterize the importance of his decision.
   ``Green issues are high on everyone's list,'' of importance,
said Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, who
cited polls showing growing environmental awareness especially in
California. The offshore oil decision, along with Bush's position
on global warming and oil exploration in the Arctic National
Wildlife Reserve, are top priorities for environmentalists, said
Fischer.
   Bush, a former Texas oilman, proclaims himself the
``environmental president.'' But environmentalists have been
dismayed by his willingness to open the Arctic National Wildlife
Reserve to oil exploration, and they decry his insistence on more
study of how gaseous emissions warm the earth in lieu of aggressive
policies against global warming.
   Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, are looking for Bush to prove
himself by signing the pending legislation that has strong
bipartisan backing.
   ``This is the first major substantive civil rights test for the
Bush administration,'' said Ralph Neas, director of the National
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   While welcoming Bush's pro-civil rights statements, the civil
rights community ``thus far has been very disappointed,'' by
several actions of the Bush Justice Department.
   ``There's no question that a veto of the Civil Rights Act of
1990 would have an adverse impact on the president's popularity
with minorities and all those who care about civil rights,'' Neas
added.
   Bush proclaims he will tolerate no barriers to civil rights, but
says he will not sign any bill that could lead to minority hiring
quotas _ in this case even a bill that does not directly call for
quotas.
   Even after Senate Republicans recently worked out a compromise
with Democrats to change language that conservatives said would
cause employers to impose minority hiring quotas, the White House
still balked.
   On the offshore oil matter, the president has not signalled his
decision, except to call for a balanced approach.
   He says he wants to protect environmentally sensitive coastal
areas, but not foreclose oil exploration that could decrease the
nation's dependence on foreign oil.
   This both-sides-of-the-coin approach has become a Bush trademark
on other ``kinder-gentler'' issues as well, most recently a
controversy over saving the northern spotted owl in Oregon.
   Not wanting to anger environmentalists, Bush said he wants to
protect the owl. But he also said that should not be done at the
expense of timber-industry jobs that would be lost by preserving
the forest lands needed to save the bird.
   ``Kinder-gentler'' advocates also cite the parental leave issue.
The president says he backs having employers voluntarily provide
unpaid leave for family emergencies. But he has threatened to veto
legislation that would require companies to do just that.

<HEAD>Four GOP Candidates Scrap for Chance to Take on Montana's Baucus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB ANEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Baucus remembers well the surprise
defeat that Montana voters dealt fellow Democratic Sen. John
Melcher in 1988, and he's maneuvering early to avoid a similar fate.
   The two-term senator faces little challenge in the Democratic
primary on June 5, but he's amassing a stash of campaign cash to
combat the winner of the four-way Republican primary.
   Baucus has raised about $2 million for what he expects will be a
$2.5 million campaign, the most expensive in the history of rural
Montana.
   Two years ago, the National Republican Senatorial Committee
pumped $205,000 into the state GOP, including $138,000 in the last
month of the campaign, to help challenger Conrad Burns overtake
Melcher.
   Baucus said the national GOP has targeted him in hopes of a
repeat.
   ``Republican candidates have said they and the Republican
National Committee will do whatever it takes to win this seat,''
Baucus said.
   The likely beneficiary of that Republican support is unclear.
   A statewide poll taken in April showed no clear leader in the
GOP race between Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad and businessman-scientist
Bruce Vorhauer. State Sen. Bill Farrell and former business
executive John Domenech lagged behind.
   In the Democratic primary, Baucus is heavily favored over John
Driscoll, a member of the state Public Service Commission, and
Billings evangelist Curly Thornton.
   Driscoll has attacked Baucus for obtaining 86 percent of his
campaign financing from out-of-state interests. But most of the
debate has been among the GOP candidates.
   Kolstad has made an issue of his lifelong ties to Montana,
contrasting his background to that of Vorhauer, who became a state
resident only last fall, and Domenech, who moved to Bozeman four
years ago.
   Farrell has accused Kolstad of not addressing the issues.
Vorhauer and Farrell have taken a pro-choice position on abortion,
while Kolstad and Domenech are anti-abortion.
   For the most part, the Republicans have similar views on other
issues and emphasize differences in style and personality.
   Kolstad, 58, was a state legislator for 20 years and operates a
family farm and ranch in north-central Montana. He joined Stan
Stephens in the 1988 gubernatorial race to become the No. 2 person
in Montana's first GOP administration in 20 years.
   Kolstad was the last to enter the Senate race, but yielded to
entreaties from President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, former
President Reagan and other national GOP leaders seeking a
well-known challenger.
   Farrell, 41, who owns a trucking company, stresses the
blue-collar roots that he believes set him apart from the other
candidates.
   Domenech, 36, quit his job as president of a pharmaceutical
testing firm to run for the Senate. He touts his business
experience and said he decided to run because he was angry about a
lack of economic opportunities in Montana.
   Vorhauer, 48, best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge, has divided his time between California,
Nevada and Montana since 1979. He helped found or develop four
businesses in western Montana.
   Baucus, 48, was born and raised in Helena, the son of a
prominent Montana ranching family. He entered politics in 1972 when
he was elected to the state House. Two years later he went on to
Congress and served two House terms before being elected to the
Senate in 1978. He was re-elected in 1984 with 57 percent of the
vote.
   Driscoll is making his second challenge to Baucus; he finished
last in a three-way Democratic primary in 1978. Thornton, who has
made preaching against alcohol and drug abuse the centerpiece of
his campaign, was new to politics in 1988 when he finished last in
a six-man Democratic gubernatorial primary.

   After more than a decade of stalemate,
Congress is close to sending sweeping clean air legislation to
President Bush.
   The House by a 401-21 margin approved pollution controls late
Wednesday on factories, automobiles and electric power plants. Most
of the most difficult disputes were worked out behind closed doors
with little floor debate.
   The Senate passed a similar bill in early April and a conference
committee is expected to work out differences, perhaps as early as
this summer.
   Wednesday's vote represented the first time in 13 years that the
House acted to revamp the 1970 federal clean air law, which
environmentalists for years have said is inadequate to rid cities
of dirty air or protect the public from toxic chemicals.
   The House bill virtually breezed through after most major issues
were resolved through bipartisan compromises in the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
   For more than a decade the committee's chairman, Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., a longtime protector of auto industry interests,
had blocked clean air legislation from advancing to the floor. His
adversary in those years was Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman
of the committee's environment subcommittee.
   But the two congressmen engineered the lengthy private
negotiations that led to the compromises and final passage.
   Talking to reporters after the vote, both Dingell and Waxman
gave some of the credit to President Bush, who last summer called
for toughening the federal clean air laws.
   The president ``gave the issue a high place in the national
agenda,'' said Waxman.
   ``We both recognize that this is the year that clean air
legislation is going to be passed into law,'' the California
Democrat continued.
   The House bill is similar to the one passed by the Senate,
although slightly tougher in some respects and weaker in others
   Like the Senate bill, the House version calls for:
   _States to implement pollution reduction plans that bring their
cities into compliance with federal air quality standards within at
least 15 years. Only Los Angeles is given more time because the
smog problem there is so severe.
   _Steep reductions in acid rain pollutants from electric power
plants. The utilities must reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions
by 10 million tons by the end of the decade.
   _Industrial plants to install the best available technology to
reduce toxic emissions. Industry reported 2.6 billion pounds of
such chemicals, including carcinogens, were released into the air
in 1988, the last year for which figures are available.
   _A reduction of smog-causing pollution from automobiles through
tighter tailpipe emission controls, cleaner fuels and a phase-in
through fleet operators of more alternativ fuel vehicles.
   But in some areas the House bill goes further than either the
Senate or the White House had wanted.
   Over strong administration objections, the House included a
financial assistance plan for workers who lose their jobs as a
result of tougher air pollution controls. The Senate rejected a
job-loss provision for coal miners.
   The $250 million five-year program approved by the House
provides an additional 6 months of unemployment compensation and
money for retraining to workers in all industries.
   The House measure also opens the way for introduction of the
most extensive use yet of automobiles that run on fuels other than
gasoline. Waxman abandoned a proposal to require automakers to
build 1 million such cars for sale in nine of the most polluted
cities.
   But a compromise measure was approved calling for a ``pilot
project'' that he said would lead to 300,000 such cars being sold
in the Los Angeles area by the end of the decade. ``It is a foot in
the door. ... I think the rest of the country will follow.''
   The automakers had vigorously resisted any production
requirement for purely non-gasoline powered cars, questioning
whether there will be a market. Industry sources said the
automakers will try to scuttle even the pilot project during House
negotiations with the Senate. The Senate bill has no such provision.
   Among other measures put into the House bill during day-long
floor action Wednesday were requirements that:
   _Cleaner gasoline blends be sold in cities with the worst
pollution. The oil industry opposed the tougher emission standards,
arguing they will require use of gasoline-ethanol blends. Ethanol
comes from grain.
   _The Environmental Protection Agency develop new regional
visibility regulations within two years for many national parks and
wilderness areas.
   _Offshore oil platforms off the California coast and elsewhere
outside the Gulf of Mexico adhere to federal air pollution
regulations. To please oil state congressmen, platforms in the Gulf
of Mexico, where most offshore oil is drilled, were exempted.
   _Chemicals such as chlorofluorcarbons, o CFCs, as well as a
number of substitutes that damage the atmospheric ozone layer be
phased out under specific timetables.

   When research reports are likely to be harmful
to business _ such as those linking passive smoke to lung cancer _
the ``patsy'' press accepts them unskeptically, says an executive
of Philip Morris.
   The news media often become loyal to one side in a health
dispute and ``lazy and uncritical of the side they support,'' says
Guy L. Smith IV, vice president for corporate affairs of the Philip
Morris Companies, Inc., a tobacco, food and beer conglomerate.
   ``Reporters and editors treat the president, the senator, the
congressman, the mayor and companies with great skepticism, which
is as it should be,'' he said. ``But let a critic of business come
along ... and the media turn over their typewriters to him.''
   Smith made his remarks Wednesday in a speech, entitled ``The
Media as Patsy,'' to a luncheon of the Media Institute, a
non-profit research organization.
   As a case in point, he cited what he called leaks about a
forthcoming Environmental Protection Agency study which, sources
have said, will report that passive smoke _ inhaled by non-smokers
_ causes more than 3,000 cases of lung cancer annually.
   ``Environmental tobacco smoke is a particularly rich field for
quack moralists to harvest bogus science,'' Smith said.
   He said the EPA assessment was based on 23 studies, 18 of which
found no link. The other five, he said, were conducted in Greece,
Japan and China and may be invalid because they did not consider
such factors as the effect of oils or charcoal used in cooking on
the non-smoker's health.
   ``Judging from the early returns, most of the media are going to
lap the report up and a new number will be added to the
anti-tobacco industry's hall of fame,'' Smith said.
   ``Maybe you can see what I mean about the media being lazy and
uncritical of the side they support, and becoming patsies.''
   Asked to comment on Smith's remarks, reporter Lewis Cope of the
Minneapolis Star Tribune, president-elect of the National
Association of Science Writers, said of the passive smoking
controversy:
   ``All the evidence is not clear on that one yet but I have a
file here full of reports that have been done by reputable
scientists and medical journals that have raised serious questions
about this. It would be irresponsible not to report where they
think the evidence is heading simply because somebody in the
industry is critical of their conclusions.''
   Of Smith's remarks generally, Cope said, ``He has a right to his
opinion but there is a need to report contrary views from reputable
scientists, particularly on matters that are so important to
people's health.''
   Smith also cited a campaign against the use of high-cholesterol
tropical oils, such as coconut and palm oil, in baked products. He
said the press did not much publicize the role of producers of
non-tropical oils in calling attention to the potential health
problems of tropical oils.
   It subsequently turned out that not enough tropical oil was
involved to make a health difference, Smith said.
   ``But the point I want to make is that the press took at face
value an anti-industry campaign that deserved at least a second
look,'' he said.
   He added: ``The health field is full of this science-by-press
release that turns reporters into patsies time and again.''
   ``In this country, we are supposed to have newspapers, not
mythpapers,'' Smith said. ``Double standard journalism and
science-by-press release are compromising the integrity of the
press.''

<HEAD>Americans Getting Centimental About the Penny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans hate being nickel-and-dimed,
but try to take away their pennies and they get downright
centimental.
   A Gallup survey released Wednesday showed nearly two out of
three penny-pinching Americans give no quarter to an idea floating
in Congress to have cash transactions rounded off to the nearest 5
cents.
   A House Banking subcommittee requested a study on the idea _
which the Gallup respondents obviously considered penny-ante _ as
part of another bill that would replace the one-dollar bill with a
coin.
   The proposal would keep pennies as legal tender ``to a maximum
of 25 cents, only if used in quantities divisible by 5 without
fraction or remainder.''
   That's the legislative way of saying you could use up your
pennies only in groups of five and no more than 25 at one time.
   Rubbish, say 62 percent of the Americans surveyed, who find the
idea penny-wise and pound-foolish.
   Some people might regard the penny as a nuisance. Stores often
keep a cup of pennies at the cash register so customers don't have
to dig to the bottoms of their purses and pockets for lint-covered
coins.
   Pennies no longer have much use. Games at penny arcades cost 50
cents. Penny gumballs are still available out of drugstore
machines. Few people even pitch pennies anymore.
   The most common use of pennies is to help pay for items priced
at levels not divisible by five.
   But introduce a bill in Congress to do away with them, and
Americans begin to sound like Benjamin Franklin.
   ``Almost all Americans recognize the penny as a historical
example of thrift and resourcefulness,'' the survey said, with 92
percent agreeing with the statement that the penny is ``a
longstanding tradition in this country.'' Sixty-two percent said
they opposed its demise.
   The survey, commissioned by a group called Americans for Common
Cents, also showed people have common-sense concerns _ for example,
how many merchants will round down their prices?
   Seventy-seven percent said they are worried that merchants will
raise prices to compensate for losses due to rounding.
   The survey of 750 adults, conducted by telephone between April
23 and April 26, has a margin of potential sampling error of plus
or minus 4 percent.
   The pending House bill, introduced last year by Rep. Jimmy
Hayes, D-La., calls for rounding the sales price down to the
nearest nickel if the price ends in 1, 2, 6 or 7 cents; the price
would be rounded up if the sum ends in 3, 4, 8 or 9 cents. An
exception: If someone still insisted on selling something for one
or two pennies, you'd have to scrape them up, not try to round down
to zero.
   The Treasury still would make pennies, but only for collectors.
   The survey revealed that women are more loyal to the penny than
men, with 70 percent of women opposing the change and 54 percent of
men. Women also were more worried about inflation caused by doing
away with the penny _ 63 percent of women were ``very concerned''
about price hikes compared to 44 percent of men.
   College graduates were less concerned about the penny than those
who did not attend college. The well-to-do were less concerned than
poorer people. Those who live in the South and Midwest were the
strongest supporters of the penny.

<HEAD>Former Aide Says Pierce Weighed Politics In Awarding HUD Grants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
wanted to know who was behind projects seeking federal housing
subsidies that brought big profits to consultants and developers, a
former top assistant says.
   Thomas Demery, former assistant secretary for housing and FHA
commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
told congressional investigators Wednesday that Pierce asserted
full control over the scandal-ridden Section 8 moderate
rehabilitation program during a January 1987 meeting.
   ``At that time, I realized that political considerations were to
be a factor in the award of mod rehab units as viewed by Secretary
Pierce,'' Demery said.
   Demery appeared voluntarily before a House Government Operations
subcommittee that has spent more than a year probing allegations of
influence-peddling, political favoritism and mismanagement at HUD
while Pierce was secretary during the Reagan administration.
   Congressional investigators viewed the testimony of Demery as
corroborating the contention earlier this month of DuBois Gilliam,
a former HUD official now serving a prison sentence for abusing HUD
programs, that Pierce was actively involved in steering housing
grants to political friends.
   Demery said he spent a year trying to gain control of the
program. He said he succeeded in March 1988 by gaining Pierce's
support for a memo restructuring the selection process, and that no
grants awarded after that time were the result of political
influence.
   But in a meeting with Pierce a year earlier, he said, the
secretary told him that the Section 8 renovation program was
Pierce's own ``to run as he wanted.'' The program provides
lucrative grants for private developers to renovate low-income
housing.
   In that 1987 meeting, three months after Demery took the job,
Pierce told him that he would provide direction for the program by
speaking through his then-executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean.
   Dean had been providing him with ``scraps of paper'' saying
``the secretary wants these requests funded,'' he said.
   Pierce appeared once before the congressional panel a year ago
and denied making funding decisions under the program or ordering
grants for political friends. Pierce invoked his 5th Amendment
rights and refused to testify again. A special prosecutor is
investigating his handling of the moderate rehabilitation program.
   Dean and her predecessor as Pierce's top assistant, Lance
Wilson, have also invoked their constitutional rights in refusing
to testify.
   Demery came under some harsh questioning by members of the
panel, however.
   ``It strikes me you were a participant, just like the rest of
them at that time,'' Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., said. ``You would
have to have been really out in left field not to know what was
going on at HUD.''
   Demery acknowledged meeting with several consultants who secured
HUD moderate rehabilitation grants for projects. Committee
investigators distributed documents found in Demery's HUD computer
files listing political supporters or consultants backing 18
requests for HUD grants. Six of them eventually received money,
including four who had contacts with Demery.
   A HUD inspector general's report released in early 1989 focused
on Demery and a pattern of contributions by HUD-connected
developers and consultants to his favorite charity, Food for
Africa, which distributes food in Mozambique. That report began
unraveling the broader HUD scandal involving influence-peddling and
political favoritism.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the panel, said there was
no evidence Food for Africa was anything less than a legitimate
charity or that Demery profited from it.
   But Demery faced some disbelieving questioning when he contended
he did not know who was contributing to the charity.

<HEAD>Farm Income Could Reach Record Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a bit more push, farm income nationally
could set records this year, according to a new analysis by
Agriculture Department
   ``The improved outlook for 1990 farm sales is strengthening
income prospects,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
Wednesday. ``Gains in cash receipts are likely to outpace both
expense increases and reductions in direct government payments.''
   Production will probably increase slightly, but strong demand
``continues to support most commodity prices'' at the farm level,
the report said.
   ``However, higher prices for feed grain producers also mean
higher feed costs for livestock producers, and stronger market
prices translate into lower deficiency payments,'' it added.
   Deficiency payments are direct subsidies due crop producers when
market prices falter. The payments help make up the difference
between a target price level and the market prices.
   Department analysts have said total deficiency payments may drop
to $9 billion or less this year from $11 billion in calendar 1989,
$14.5 billion in 1988 and a peak of $16.7 billion in 1987.
   Overall, net cash income of farmers is forecast at $55 billion
to $59 billion this year, up $1 billion from prospects a few months
ago, the report said. That would compare with about $53 billion in
1989 and the record of $57.2 billion in 1988.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Commodities sold actually may have been
produced in earlier years and stored until harvested.
   In another method of accounting, the report said ``net farm
income'' is now expected to be in the range of $47 billion to $51
billion in 1990, up $2 billion from the earlier estimate but about
the same as last year's record $49 billion.
   Economists use net farm income to gauge the value of
agricultural production in a year, whether it is sold or stored,
plus government payments. Deductions are made for all costs,
including depreciation and other factors. Changes in the value of
inventories held on the farm also are considered.
   Income gains and declines are not uniform in the agricultural
sector any more than they are across the national economy.
   ``While net cash income is forecast to grow at the national
level, it likely will decline 2 percent to 3 percent in the
Northeast, remain unchanged in the South Central region, grow about
6 percent to 8 percent in the Southeast and West, and rise 8
percent to 9 percent in the Midwest,'' the report said.
   Farm asset values, mostly land, are projected to rise for the
fourth straight year to between $870 billion and $880 billion by
the end of this year. That does not include the value of household
assets.
   The peak in farm assets was $996.7 billion in 1981 before the
sharp declines in land values and other financial troubles shoved
the asset level down to $689.5 billion in 1986.

   U.S. agricultural exports are running ahead of
a year ago's pace, and Japan is leading the pack as usual, an
Agriculture Department trade report shows.
   In the first six months of the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct.
1, export values totaled $21.9 billion, up 4 percent from the same
period in fiscal 1989.
   The department has projected exports at $38.5 billion for the
entire 1989-90 year, down from $39.7 billion in 1988-89 because of
lower prices for grains and oilseeds.
   Through March, Japan had imported nearly $4.29 billion of U.S.
agricultural commodities, a 1 percent increase from the same period
a year earlier, the latest report said.
   Shipments to the Soviet Union during the first half of the year
were unchanged at about $1.87 billion.
   Other major foreign buyers and values of U.S. commodity
shipments in the first six months of the current year, included:
   Canada, $1.53 billion, adjusted for transshipments, up 56
percent; South Korea, $1.4 billion, up 22 percent; Mexico, $1.36
billion, down 3 percent; Netherlands, $1.1 billion, not adjusted
for transshipments, down 14 percent; and Taiwan, $1 billion, up 25
percent.
   Some other large U.S. markets included: West Germany, $722
million, up 22 percent; Spain, $707 million, up 1 percent; Egypt,
$474 million, down 4 percent; China, $463 million, down 34 percent;
Italy, $433 million, up 21 percent; United Kingdom, $412 million;
and Iraq, $368 million, own 8 percent.

   The U.S. Patent Office told Steve Wingard of
Columbia, S.C., that he is now the holder of patent number
4,912,914 for his invention of a new forage harvester.
   Wingard, who operates a hay farm, says his apparatus can cut,
cure and bale hay in a single pass over the field.
   Although there have been some shortcut methods in use over the
years, the classic method of hay making is to cut, rake, windrow
and bale or stack hay crop. This can take several days while
waiting for they hay to dry, a period when rain can damage or ruin
the crop.
   Wingard says his ``once-over hay maker'' cuts hay by
conventional means and then passes the cuttings through a system of
high-temperature rollers, which use heat and pressure to remove
much of the crop's moisture.
   The hay then is baled, with the entire process requiring less
than a minute, he told The Associated Press.
   Wingard can be reached at: Wingard Hay Farms, 419 Lyndhurst
Road, Columbia, S.C. 29212 or phone 803 798-6147.

   In the world of high-finance politics,
U.S. Rep. Romano Mazzoli has rolled the dice by refusing political
action committee money.
   Without the incumbent's usual financial edge, the 10-term
Democrat faces a tough battle in Tuesday's primary. His main
challenger is Louisville businessman Jeff Hutter, who drew 39
percent of the vote against Mazzoli two years ago.
   ``This is something that has been growing in me for some
while,'' Mazzoli said in a recent interview. ``I've always felt
politics belongs to the people, not to the large special interest
groups.''
   Mazzoli, 57, decided in December to set an example by becoming
one of only about two dozen members of Congress who reject PAC
contributions. PACs had contributed about half of the money for
Mazzoli's past campaigns.
   To offset his loss of PAC money _ $200,000 during his run in
1988 _ Mazzoli has mounted an aggressive fund-raising campaign.
   As of last Friday, he said he had raised $133,370 from 2,018
individual contributors. He had 850 individual donations at that
stage in the 1988 campaign.
   Hutter has raised more money than Mazzoli, mainly because he has
accepted $40,000 from PACs. He had raised $172,550 through May 9.
   Mazzoli's other opponent, Louisville alderman Paul Bather,
estimated he will raise $60,000, about $5,000 of that from PACs.
   The Republican primary pits Al Brown, an employee-relations
consultant seeking to become the first black Republican in the
House since the Depression, against Tim Hardy, president of a
lighting fixture company.
   Mazzoli said PACs contribute nearly three-fourths of their money
to candidates seeking re-election. ``Instead of leveling the
playing field, PACs have become a force to keep incumbents in
office,'' he said.
   But Hutter, a former local TV reporter, said, ``PACs have a
purpose as long as they are held in balance'' with individual
donations.
   He accused Mazzoli of raising the campaign-finance issue to
divert attention from his record and ``create an issue on which to
run.''
   Hutter has criticized Mazzoli for voting to repeal the
Catastrophic Health Care Act, raise the salaries of members of
Congress and severely restrict abortions.
   Bather said campaign finance reform is an important issue, but
he doubted whether it should receive top billing among a myriad of
other issues.
   But Mazzoli said his re-election bid offers a timely backdrop to
the current debate in Congress about changing the method of
financing campaigns.
   ``I feel good about what we've done,'' he said. ``Wherever I go
people pat me on the back and commend me for what I've done. This
could be a sort of pattern-setter if I'm able to pull it off.''

<HEAD>Washington Schedulers Fret Over Incomplete Soviet Itinerary</HEAD>

   As official Washington gears up for next
week's superpower summit, a question of mounting U.S. interest is
how Mikhail Gorbachev will use his ``free time'' between and after
formal meetings with President Bush.
   Whom will he see? Where will he go? How will he get there?
   ``It's still not set in concrete,'' William Black, the State
Department's assistant chief of protocol, said Wednesday.
   The schedule is of particular importance to the Secret Service,
which is coordinating the 24-hour security required by U.S. law for
a visiting head of state.
   Black said his office is working with the Soviets day and night
to try to settle details of the Soviet president's itinerary during
his Washington stay beginning next Wednesday evening and ending
June 3. Gorbachev is scheduled then to go to Minnesota for six
hours, then visit San Francisco and return to Moscow on June 4.
   ``It's been hard'' getting the Soviet advance team in Washington
to fill in the many blanks in Gorbachev's itinerary, another State
Department official said. The official discussed the matter on
condition of anonymity.
   Phone calls to the Soviet Embassy press section Wednesday were
not returned. Officials there on Tuesday said many details of
Gorbachev's cross-country visit were unsettled and that it was
unclear when his plans would be announced publicly.
   The embassy did get out word about the new English-language
publication of Gorbachev's book, ``Perestroika and Soviet-American
Relations.'' An embassy announcement reprinted the book's preface
in which Gorbachev expresses optimism about the future of
superpower relations and ends with the timely salutation: ``Until
the next meeting with America.''
   Gorbachev is to have at least six hours of official meetings
with Bush at the White House on May 31 and June 1, followed by a
trip with Bush to Camp David, Md., on June 2 and a joint news
conference June 3.
   Gorbachev is to fly to Minneapolis after the news conference for
meetings with political and business leaders.
   He then goes to San Francisco where he'll meet over breakfast
June 4 with former President Ronald Reagan and former Secretary of
State George P. Shultz. After visiting Stanford University and
meeting with scholars from the Hoover Institution, he'll meet with
business executives and state political figures before returning to
Moscow.
   American security and protocol officials are used to planning
far in advance the most minute details of a U.S. presidential
visit, so they've been a bit distressed at the Soviets' more
relaxed approach to setting Gorbachev's itinerary.
   One example cited by the State Department official was
uncertainty over whether Gorbachev wanted to join Bush in the
presidential helicopter for the day trip to Camp David next
Saturday, or whether he preferred to travel separately.
   ``I've asked three times and I still don't know,'' the official
said. ``They say, `We're still working on that.''
   Gorbachev's advance teams may be keeping an eye out for planned
protests by groups opposed to Moscow's efforts to stifle
independence bids by the Baltic republics, including Lithuania,
which is the target of a Soviet energy embargo.
   Americans of Baltic extraction are planning protests in the San
Francisco area and possibly elsewhere.
   ``We want (Gorbachev) to see what he's doing is really wrong,
especially the blockade,'' said Joe Sidas of the Baltic Alliance,
an umbrella group for various organizations of the nearly 5,000
Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians in the San Francisco Bay area.
   This will be Gorbachev's third U.S. visit and his second summit
in Washington.
   Black said he was resigned to coping with uncertainty over the
Soviet itinerary.
   ``These things tend to have a life of their own. They are
subject to change right up to the 11th hour, the 59th minute. You
do learn to live with it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug-Related Deaths Dropped 17 Percent in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials are taking heart from
preliminary information that drug-related deaths dropped by 17
percent last year, but they're not ready to call off the war on
drugs.
   ``I wouldn't take all the troops home'' on the basis of data
provided by medical examiners to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, said David Tell, deputy chief of staff to William Bennett,
the national drug control policy coordinator.
   ``Notwithstanding the sharpness of the drop, it's a sharp drop
from unprecedented high numbers,'' Tell said Wednesday. ``The
numbers are still too big.''
   Asked if the information means the government is winning the war
on drugs, Tell said, ``I wouldn't go that far.''
   The data _ released by Bennett's Office of National Drug Control
Policy _ comes from medical examiners in 25 cities that submitted
reports for 1988 and 1989. The examiners made ``mentions'' of drugs
whenever a body autopsied was found to have a drug or drugs in the
system. It did not necessarily mean the substances caused the death.
   The medical examiners reported a total of 2,147 mentions of
drugs in the fourth quarter of 1989, a 35 percent drop from 3,299
in the third quarter.
   For the year, total mentions of drugs by medical examiners
dropped 17 percent, from 14,555 in 1988 to 12,106 in 1989,
according to the provisional information.
   The information indicates that ``hard-core drug use seems to
have peaked and may now be dropping,'' Tell said, but added, ``The
numbers are still unacceptably high. Let's have another couple of
quarters of information.''
   Andrea Kopstein of NIDA also cautioned that the data is still
incomplete and that even if the numbers hold up when the reports
are finished, ``This is just one three-month period of a year.
Trends are not made on one data point.''
   In addition, the statistics do not include Los Angeles because
that city submitted its 1989 data late. Those figures could have a
major impact on the overall picture, as the metropolitan area was
responsible for almost 21 percent of all medical examiner mentions
of drugs nationwide in 1988.
   Cocaine mentions dropped 47 percent in the last quarter of 1989,
from 756 to 404. For the year, the decline was 15 percent, from
3,111 to 2,649.
   Heroin mentions declined 36 percent in the fourth quarter, from
548 to 351. For the year, the heroin decline was 14 percent, from
2,292 to 1,960.
   New York is responsible for about one-third of the total drug
mentions and dramatic declines there skewed the figures somewhat.
When New York's data is not included, mentions of all drugs by
medical examiners dropped by 10 percent for the year, cocaine
mentions declined by 7 percent and heroin mentions decreased by 10
percent.
   The number of drug mentions by medical examiners in 1989 still
remains higher than te 1987 level. Excluding Los Angeles and New
York City, which did not submit such information for 1987, the
total for 1989 was 8,219, compared with 9,096 the previous year and
8,006 in 1987.
   The information comes from reports of medical examiners in the
metropolitan areas of Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Buffalo, N.Y.;
Chicago; Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Indianapolis; Kansas
City; Miami; Minneapolis; Newark, N.J.; New Orleans; Norfolk, Va.;
Oklahoma City; Philadelphia; Phoenix; St. Louis; San Antonio,
Texas; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle, Wash.; and Washington.
   Meanwhile, an internal Drug Enforcement Administration document
indicates that the purity of cocaine sold nationwide dropped in the
first four months of 1990, falling far from its peak purity in 1988.
   The street purchases of grams reflected the most significant
decline. They dropped on average from 72 percent pure in 1988 to 55
percent pure in the first four months of this year, DEA spokesman
Cornelius Dougherty said Wednesday. At the ounce level, purity
declined from 79 percent to 62 percent. At the kilo level, purity
declined from 90 percent to 73 percent.
   Dougherty said the purity decreases ``could reflect a decline in
availability,'' but the DEA is hesitant to draw broad conclusions
from the relatively small sampling.

   Former American University President Richard
E. Berendzen says the obscene telephone calls he made were
``inappropriate and grotesque'' and that he has recently apologized
to his victim.
   Berendzen, who pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of
making obscene telephone calls, will serve no jail time as long as
he receives psychological treatment and remains on good behavior.
   He spoke Wednesday night in an interview on ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' program.
   ``I would hang up the phone back a couple of months ago and sit
there for a minute or two in my office wearing my Washington
business suit and think, `Why on earth have I had this
conversation?''' he said in his televised interview. ``It was a
total incongruity in my life which I simply did not understand.''
   He would not elaborate on the contents of his telephone calls.
   ``I don't want to get into the conversations, but it was quite
inappropriate and grotesque,'' he said.
   Fairfax County General District Court Judge J. Conrad Waters Jr.
sentenced Berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge. He suspended
all of the jail time, provided the educator stays out of trouble
for one year and continues treatment.
   Hours after Berendzen's court appearance, Johns Hopkins
University Hospital released a five-page statement that said the
51-year-old former president had been sexually abused as a
youngster.
   ``He was sexually and emotionally abused severely as a child,''
said the statement, which the hospital said was released by the
authority of Dr. Paul R. McHugh, chairman of the hospital's
Psychiatry Department.
   ``He did not place calls for prurient interests; rather in a
confused way, he was seeking answers to unresolved issues relating
to his own abuse.'' The person who allegedly abused Berendzen was
identified only as an adult woman who was close to him, a release
issued by McHugh said.
   In a statement read outside the court by his attorney, Gerard
Treanor, Berendzen said, ``In no way do I offer this report as an
excuse for my conduct. Rather, it gives additional information,
fills out the story, and provides a fuller context for my actions.''
   Berendzen said he would continue treatment on an outpatient
basis at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, as ordered by the
court, and would report to the court every 90 days.
   Susan Allen, the victim of Berendzen's telephone calls, said she
was satisfied with the court action.
   ``As far as what the judge decided to do, I cannot criticize the
judge. He did what he felt was just and fair,'' Allen said.
   Berendzen said that he sent a letter of apology to Allen.
   Allen told ABC that Berendzen would talk about having child sex
slaves and once boasted that he kept a 4-year-old girl in a dog
cage in his basement and fed her human waste.
   Berendzen was treated at the psychiatric ward of the hospital
from April 10 through May 4, officials said. He was evaluated by
the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic prior to admission,
McHugh said.
   Berendzen was interviewed after the administration of sodium
amytal, along with psychological testing, McHugh said. Berendzen's
pain and confusion about his childhood surfaced when his father
died in 1988, when he visited his childhood home, McHugh said.
   This ``concludes a chapter in my life of pain, apprehension and
sorrow,'' Berendzen said in a statement released by his attorney.
``It has been a necessary step, one I have taken after much
contemplation and with deep regret for my actions.''
   Berendzen said on television that for some time he was able to
avoid his urges by throwing himself into his university work.
   Berendzen resigned April 8 as president of the Washington, D.C.,
university, saying he was exhausted. He was charged May 11.
   The charges were the result of phone calls Berendzen made March
28 and 29, police said. During the calls, Berendzen talked about
``explicit, detailed, gross and graphic sex with adults and
children,'' one of the victims said.
   The university's Board of Trustees said in a statement following
Berendzen's resignation that the Harvard-educated astronomer quit
``in the best interest of the university'' after ``allegations of
improper behavior.''
   Berendzen had been president of the university since 1980.
   The trustees appointed Dr. Milton Greenberg as the interim
president and started a nationwide search for a permanent
replacement.

<HEAD>NATO Relaxing War Readiness Status</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States and its NATO allies are
relaxing the high-alert status of some front-line troops in a major
battlefield adjustment to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.
   The decision came as NATO is struggling to adapt to the
widespread changes in Europe by emphasizing the alliance's
political strengths, rather than highlighting its war-fighting
capabilities.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Wednesday that with the
unraveling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, ``we can afford to change
the current status of our forces.''
   Cheney, speaking with reporters after a two-day NATO session,
said ``some near-term reductions in readiness levels'' will be
begun July 1 among NATO forces.
   ``These are drastic changes,'' said Gen. Klaus Naumann, security
adviser to Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg of West Germany.
   ``Today's meeting signifies an important step toward a new
security relationship in Europe,'' NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner said.
   The changes can take place now that the allies appear to have up
to ``at least a few months'' warning time of a full-scale Soviet
attack, Cheney told reporters aboard his plane.
   ``It's clear that ... given the developments in Europe, we have
more advance notice of a Soviet military attack on NATO than we
have been able to plan for, for years,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary added that the warning time could increase
substantially if an arms accord limiting troops and non-nuclear
weapons can be implemented and Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe.
   Lengthened warning time of a Soviet attack has important
implications for U.S. military planners, since most of America's
defense budget is directed to fighting in NATO's defense.
   Cheney had attended a NATO session in Brussels, Belgium, where
the pact's defense ministers ordered a hard look at the alliance's
military strategy now that democratic governments have replaced
hard-line communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   The ministers also challenged Moscow to stop foot-dragging in
the conventional arms talks so an accord can be wrapped up this
year.
   Moscow and Washington have settled on a plan to trim their
forces to 195,000 for each side in Central Europe, with the United
States retaining an additional 30,000 in Britain and southern
Europe. The United States currently has 305,000 troops in Europe,
while the Soviets have an estimated 565,000.
   Still unresolved are reductions in combat aircraft and measures
to ensure compliance with an eventual accord.
   The Brussels meeting was one of several NATO meetings held in
preparation for the July summit of alliance leaders called by
President Bush.
   The Soviets are balking at the prospect of a united Germany
joining NATO. And the western alliance is fighting calls from some
Europeans that it and the Warsaw Pact be disbanded and replaced by
an umbrella security organization focused on human rights issues.
   In their final communique, the ministers said they intended to
``reap the benefits'' of the improved climate in East-West
relations and ``decided to take steps to lower the readiness and
availability of a number of our standing forces.''
   Cheney said the change involved ``adjustments of hours and
days'' in which troops are called upon to be ready for battle.
   Within a 24-hour period, for example, nearly a half-dozen crews
take turns standing watch so a jet fighter squadron or troop
transport helicopter unit could take flight within minutes in the
event of an attack.
   Such round-the-clock alerts are costly in both financial and
human terms, and adjustments offer some relief as military budgets
are cut and the ranks of U.S. soldiers stationed in Europe are
expected to be thinned under a troop cutting accord.
   ``A helicopter unit that is supposed to be ... ready to go
within four hours of the gun going off, now would have 48 hours,'
explained Stephen Hadley, the assistant secretary of defense for
international policy, who accompanied Cheney to Brussels.
   Cheney called the ``initial change'' a modest one, noting that
the adjustments ordered were those that NATO's top commander, U.S.
Gen. John Galvin, could make on his own authority.
   But the secretary said Galvin was ordered to consider additional
changes which might require the ministers' approval.

<HEAD>Commission Recommends New Immigration Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional commission wants a new
independent agency to administer most immigration and refugee
policies.
   Under the proposal, most of the service functions now performed
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the State
Department would be consolidated in a new agency. Border security
and interdiction efforts would be kept separate.
   A draft report by the commission proposes creation of a new
Agency for Migration Affairs to coordinate immigration policy and
services.
   ``Immigration policy is far too important to be relegated to a
stepchild agency such as the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which falls uncomfortably within the Department of Justice
and which historically has been beset with serious management and
resource problems,'' said the Commission for the Study of
International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development.
   ``Nor should these functions be diluted among three different
bureaus in the State Department where they too often are
subordinated to short-term department considerations and compete
for resources and attention,'' the report added.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, chairman of the House immigration
subcommittee, said he favored consolidating many immigration
functions but opposed creating a new federal agency.
   Morrison, D-Conn., said he also favored separating alien
interdiction efforts from the service functions performed by INS
and the State Department.
   The report said an independent agency was needed because ``no
mechanism exists within the U.S. government to weigh the impact of
migration, to rank it against other priorities or to bring it to
the attention of decision makers.''
   Citizenship, immigration and refugee policy would be
administered by the new agency under the proposal, first reported
in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post.
   The Border Patrol would remain a part of the Justice Department.
The Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs Service would continue to play
separate roles in turning back illegal aliens.
   The 12-member commission was created by the 1986 immigration
reform law to identify the factors that encourage migration to the
United States.
   The draft study said increased economic aid and trade
concessions to impoverished nations was needed to discourage
migration to this country.
   ``The issue for many countries is stark: They either export
goods and services to create jobs at home, or they export people,''
the report said.

<HEAD>Experts Want To Monitor Workers' Finances To Catch Spies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of experts wants the government to
know a lot more about the personal finances of workers with access
to top secrets, because money has become the root of modern spying.
   The experts' appeal for 13 new laws was warmly received by the
Senate Intelligence Committee, whose chairman, David Boren,
D-Okla., and vice chairman, William Cohen, R-Maine, set them to
work nine months ago.
   Nevertheless, as the experts presented their report Wednesday,
Democratic and Republican senators indicated they might revise the
proposals to introduce additional protections for civil liberties.
   Many of the proposals would allow government investigators to
intrude much more deeply into the personal finances of the 700,000
government and weapons industry employees who hold top secret
clearances.
   To get those jobs, they would have to agree to allow
investigators to examine their bank and commercial credit records
anytime up to five years after they leave the secret work.
   They would be required to report any foreign travel and any
contacts with citizens of foreign countries.
   The 25,000 to 30,000 employees who work with codes and code
machines would be subject to random polygraph tests. But the
questions would be limited to whether they spied or sold secrets
and would not cover _ as Sen. Boren put it _ ``how many cocktails
they drank or X-rated movies they saw.''
   Sen. Cohen asked whether the lawmakers ought to write in
assurances that a polygraph test alone could not result in firing.
The informal chairman of the experts, Eli Jacobs, a venture
capitalist and government defense policy adviser, assured him the
experts agreed that the polygraph ``should not be the sole
indicator of suitability.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked how many investigators
would have access to travel records and whether they could be
prevented from misusing information about a trip for an abortion or
for an extramarital affair.
   Columbia University law professor Harold Edgar told him only
1,000 investigators would see such information. Retired Navy Adm.
Bobby Ray Inman, a former deputy CIA director, said Congress could
require that information unrelated to spying be destroyed.
   The experts also recommended making it a crime to possess spy
tools, like burst transmitters and secret writing devices, with
intent to commit espionage.
   And they proposed making it a crime just to sell a document
stamped top secret. The government would no longer have to disclose
the contents in court or prove the material deserved the top secret
stamp.
   ``We hope this legislation would raise the risk that individuals
would run by engaging in espionage, first, that they would be
caught and, second, that they would end up paying a penalty,
serving time in jail,'' said Inman said.
   Inman told the senators that the nine-member panel had looked
for patterns in the spy cases of recent years. In the 1960s there
was ``an overwhelmingly shift from recruitment'' of spies through
ideology to ``volunteer'' spies, usually seeking money, he said.
   He presented an analysis of 19 well-known cases in the last 20
years. Money was a motive in 14.
   Sen. Boren praised the experts for pointing out ``a blind spot''
in U.S. defenses. Once workers obtain security clearances, ``we
know less about them financially than if they're applying for an
auto loan,'' Boren said.
   The experts and the senators emphasized that the recent changes
in communist countries would merely shift the focus of spies from
military to economic secrets.
   But under questioning from Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., Prof.
Edgar acknowledged that ``the proposals do not specifically treat
economic espionage'' aimed at private corporate secrets unless they
also are government defense secrets.
   The panel also proposed:
   _Giving the FBI power to obtain credit records in secret with a
letter certifying that the subject was suspected of spying, and
allowing the FBI to obtain secretly the names of unlisted-telephone
owners who call spy suspects.
   The Bush administration is seeking these two changes but they
have been rejected before.
   _Barring spies from profiting from books about their crimes.
   _Stripping retirement pay from U.S. workers convicted of spying
abroad.
   _Establishing a $1 million reward for turning in a spy.
   _Requiring the FBI to obtain a secret warrant before
burglarizing a suspected spy. Such warrants are required to plant
listening device; the burglaries, so-called ``black bag jobs,'' are
done under inherent presidential powers.
   _Allowing the National Security Agency, the nation's code
agency, to counsel troubled former employees.
   The other experts are: former CIA Director Richard Helms; former
deputy Attorney General and deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher; former Carter White House counsel Lloyd Cutler; former
Reagan White House counsel Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.; former
ambassador to the Organization of American States Sol Linowitz and
former ambassador and State Department official Seymour Weiss.

   As the savings and loan crisis deepens, a key
congressional committee plans to intensify its investigation of one
of the costliest thrift failures by looking into government
regulators' role in the debacle.
   The House Banking Committee finished two days of hearings
Wednesday on the $1 billion collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association of Denver.
   Several witnesses _ including President Bush's son Neil, a
former director of Silverado _ appeared at the request of the
committee.
   But 10 other people who failed to show up were subpoenaed by the
panel and are expected to appear at future hearings. They include
former federal regulators as well as former executives of Silverado
and businessmen who borrowed heavily from the thrift.
   The committee has serious concerns about the role played by
regulators, particularly at the Topeka, Kan., offices of the
Federal Home Loan Bank and the Office of Thrift Supervision, who
were responsible for overseeing Silverado.
   ``We must marvel at the seeming inability of the thrift
regulators to use preventive medicine,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, told the hearing on Tuesday.
   ``If the regulators didn't like a particular brand of explosive,
the Silverado management would happily go back to the storeroom and
use another equally dangerous mixture,'' Gonzalez said. ``In the
end, they were going to blow the institution sky-high.''
   Among the no-shows subpoenaed by the committee are Kermit
Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Topeka,
and Tommie D. Thompson, former district director of the OTS in that
city.
   And if some Democrats on the committee have their way, the
investigation would be widened to include the Justice Department _
and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh would be called to testify.
   ``No savings and loan investigation by this committee will be
complete until the attorney general appears as a witness,'' Rep.
Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., said Wednesday.
   ``We must find out why the Justice Department is so reluctant to
investigate savings and loan cases. The taxpayers have a
half-trillion reasons to want an answer to the question: When are
the savings and loan crooks going to jail?''
   The Bush administration dramatically boosted its estimate
Wednesday for rescuing the thrift industry, blaming a slumping real
estate market for putting a far higher number of S&amp;Ls at risk. It
said more than 1,000 additional thrifts could fail and the
government will need to borrow between $90 billion and $130 billion
to clean up the mess.
   Neil Bush told the banking committee that his business
relationships didn't conflict with his role as a director of
Silverado. He said allegations of conflict of interest from federal
regulators ``are frivolous.''
   ``The fact they are being pursued is baffling to me,'' said
Bush, 34, an oil and gas developer.
   Bush said his business relationships with two of Silverado's
major borrowers, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, ``don't
create a conflict in fact or in law.'' Regulators have alleged that
loans by Silverado to the two were a conflict of interest for Bush,
who had oil and gas business deals with the men but failed to
disclose that relationship to Silverado's board.
   Bush said Walters was ``a passive, limited partner in JNB''
Exploration, Bush's company, but had no involvement in operations
of the enterprise. Walters put $150,000 into JNB.
   Bush said his own investment was $100 ``and sweat. I was out
there working every day. I generated the deals.''
   A federal regulator told the committee Tuesday that Bush, a
focal point of the inquiry into the Silverado failure, approved
$106 million in loans to Walters, who defaulted on the entire
amount.

<HEAD>New Report Shows Fewer Problems in Nation's Nursing Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scorecard for the nation's nursing homes
shows fewer quality problems overall than the previous survey
found, but federal health officials say more improvement is needed.
   Inspections in 1988-89 found nearly a quarter of the 15,000
nursing homes with Medicaid and Medicare patients did not
administer drugs properly, and more than a third did not meet
standards for food storage and preparation.
   Among the 10,000 homes that provide skilled nursing care, more
than a quarter did not assure good personal hygiene for residents,
and that was a problem for 18 percent of the 5,000 intermediate
care facilities.
   ``We are doing much better on some areas than we are doing on
others,'' said Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration.
   But, she added Wednesday, ``I would be much happier as a public
official if those numbers were a lot lower, and we'll continue to
work to get them just as low as we can.''
   The information is in a 93-volume guide _ at least one volume
per state _ put out by Wilensky's agency to help consumers select
nursing homes.
   It provides basic information that consumers should use to ask
questions of nursing home operators, she said, but stressed that
``this is not the definitive guide to nursing home selection.''
   ``It indicates that if you are looking at a particular nursing
home in your state, and problems existed at the time they were
(inspected), you ought to go in and say what have you done to
correct the deficiencies,'' she said.
   The reports are based on the most recent, unannounced inspection
of the nursing homes. In cases where quality standards were not
met, homes were told to correct the deficiencies, she said.
Inspectors then must return to the home to see whether the
corrections are adequate, and if they are not, action may be taken
against the home by the state or federal government.
   The massive report, the second in a planned annual series,
grades the performance of the nursing homes on 32 of the 500 or so
categories judged during on-site inspections at least once a year.
   The categories include such things as cleanliness, medical
supervision, nursing care, availability of emergency services, food
quality and attention to personal needs.
   As was the case last year when the first report was issued, many
in the nursing home industry called the documents incomplete and
misleading.
   Paul Willging of the American Health Care Association, which
represents 10,000 nursing homes with 1 million residents, said the
guide is ``not reliable. In fact, the guide could be harmful to
consumers who use it as a shortcut to selecting a nursing home.''
   The National Council on the Aging said the reports rely on the
personal judgments made by 3,000 state inspectors, whose opinions
can vary greatly. And the American Association of Homes for the
Aging said the report does not indicate the seriousness of the
violations.
   ``Two nursing homes can look very similar on paper, yet actually
be quite different in their quality of care,'' said Sheldon
Goldberg, association president.
   But Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association
of Retired Persons, said the reports were ``a reliable source that
will help people to make a more informed decision in the selection
of a nursing home.''
   The National Council of Senior Citizens and the National
Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform said they were
disturbed by the extent of the problems at nursing homes and called
for stronger enforcement efforts.
   The most common deficiency was in sanitary food conditions _ 36
percent of the skilled-care homes did not meet this standard,
compared with 43 percent in the report for 1987-88.
   The next most common deficiency among skilled-care facilities
was in ensuring good personal hygiene of residents, a category
which 26 percent failed. Previously, 30 percent did not meet this
standard.
   Also, nearly 25 percent of skilled-care facilities were not
administering drugs properly, down from 29 percent in 1987-88.
   The failure rate for intermediate-care homes followed a similar
pattern as the skilled-care facilities.

<HEAD>Workers Bury Colleague Killed In Clash With Sandinista Police</HEAD>

   Angry sugar cane workers chanting
``Justice, justice!'' buried a teen-age co-worker killed in a clash
with Sandinista-controlled police during a dispute with a
Sandinista-controlled refinery and union.
   ``Police exceeded their orders,'' Minister of Government Carlos
Hurtado told a Managua news conference Wednesday evening.
   ``They had instructions not to use any type of force or
violence,'' said Hurtado, a member of the conservative government
of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro that replaced the leftist Sandinista
administration one month ago.
   Also Wednesday, a Nicaraguan official said the bankrupt
government needs $750 million from the United States and elsewhere
to help revive the inflation-wracked, moribund economy.
   One worker was killed and four wounded in the roadside clash
Tuesday afternoon near Montelimar, about 25 miles south of Managua.
   The dead worker, Fausto Felix Ramirez, 17, was buried by an
angry crowd of sugar cane workers in the nearby town of San Bartolo
on Wednesday afternoon.
   ``Justice, justice!,'' they chanted as Ramirez's wooden coffin
was carried through town to the cemetery.
   Hurtado said the investigation would take place under military
auspices. The police are considered part of the nation's military
forces and like the military, they are still largely controlled by
Sandinista officers.
   Twenty-five policemen have been restricted to quarters as a
result of the Montelimar incident, said Rene Vivas, chief of the
national police.
   The caneworkers had closed down the sugar refinery in
Montelimar, seeking the ouster of the Sandinista-appointed director.
   The workers had deserted a Sandinista-controlled union for a
union allied with Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition
shortly after Mrs. Chamorro took office April 25.
   They said the refinery director, Jose Leon Roman, fired workers
and docked pay in retaliation. When Roman refused to resign,
several hundred workers boarded trucks and headed for Managua to
present a petition to the government.
   Workers said they were ambushed by police two miles from the
plant. The police threw tear gas grenades, shot at workers and
punctured the tires on several of the trucks, the workers said.
   A Sandinista army lieutenant interviewed at the Montelimar
refinery said the workers were at fault. He said machete-wielding
caneworkers had attempted to block refinery entrances with
machinery and had surrounded a police car on the road.
   ``This is a machete strike,'' he said, referring to the long
knives used to cut sugar cane. The lieutenant refused to give his
name.
   Truckloads of sugar cane were parked near the silenced refinery
Wednesday. The administration and Sandinista union buildings were
closed, and residents of the small town that has grown up around
the refinery said none of the administrators had been seen since
Tuesday night.
   A 15-foot-high yellow tractor with punctured tires was still
parked at one refinery entrance Wednesday afternoon, and several
cane trucks with shot out tires still sat on the road at the site
where the ambush occurred.
   Central Bank director Francisco Mayorga told a U.S. official
that Nicaragua would be asking for $750 million from the United
States and other sources to recover from its economic crisis.
   Mayorga told Ronald Roskens, head of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, that Nicaragua hoped to get help from
almost 30 nations as well as international organizations.
   ``We think we can also count on generous help from the United
States for long-term credits for the reconstruction of Nicaragua,''
Mayorga said at a news conference.
   Roskens said his talks with Mayorga had been ``fruitful.'' The
U.S. Congress is close to passing a bill that would provide $300
million for Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 9,000 Toastmaster, four-slice toasters
will be replaced by the manufacturer because a defective switch
poses a fire hazard or could burn or severely shock users.
   Toastmaster Inc. of Columbia, Mo., told the Consumer Product
Safety Commission on Wednesday it will replace 8,857 of its model
D126T toasters because the defective switch allows the electric
heating elements to continue operating after the toasting cycle has
been completed.
   The chrome-based toasters were manufactured and sold nationwide
between April and June 1989. The Toastmaster name appears on a
black and silver nameplate in the lower right-hand corner of each
toaster.
   Consumers should also check the crumb tray at the bottom of the
toaster for a five-letter and digit date code enumerated from EL101
to EL158.
   Consumers may call the company at 1-800-527-3069 for

   A National Institutes of Health committee says
more research is needed before injections of immunoglobulin blood
cells are used generally to treat babies with AIDS.
   The committee made the recommendation Wednesday after studying
the uses of an treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy,
or IVIG, which is becoming widely used for a variety of illnesses
related to the immune system.
   Dr. Peter E. Lipsky, the committee chairman and a professor at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said that
although IVIG has been reported in one limited study as useful in
treating newborns with AIDS, there have been no clinical trials to
prove its value.
   ``The treatment is unpleasant,'' said Lipsky. ``If it doesn't
afford much benefit, it doesn't make sense to subject them to this
expensive treatment.''
   Clinical trials are now underway, the committee said, to
determine whether the IVIG therapy can help babies born with AIDS
to develop natural defenses against disease.

   The federal government says it is intensifying
an investigation of reported steering-wheel vibrations in Hyundai
Excels manufactured between 1987 and 1989.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported
Wednesday it had received 294 complaints of ``extreme vibrations''
when the cars reach ``highway speeds.''
   The agency upgraded its investigation from a preliminary
evaluation, involving mostly paperwork, to an engineering analysis
in which the allegedly defective parts are inspected. The process
could bring about a recall.
   Also upgraded to engineering-analysis status were preliminary
evaluations of 1987-88 General Motors Corp. Astro and Safari
minivans and 1989-90 Chrysler Corp. Cherokee Wagoneers.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. J. Lee Simmons isn't sure his
Operation Rescue followers are willing to ante up in their fight to
stop abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court raised the stakes.
   The high court Monday upheld a ban on Operation Rescue
demonstrations aimed at preventing women from entering New York
City-area abortion clinics. A week earlier, the court left intact a
ban on Operation Rescue blockades in Atlanta.
   ``There's a small handful determined to carry on no matter
what,'' said Simmons, head of Operation Rescue in central New York.
``But for the average guy in an office, or the homemaker with
children, the price is getting too high to pay. I own a house, I
have four children and a ministry, I can't afford big fines and
long jail sentences. Not many people can.''
   The rulings may force Operation Rescue to change its tactics but
are not expected to have a significant bearing on the abortion
debate, some observers say.
   ``It's not an abortion case. It's a First Amendment case, and
frankly, one without any fireworks,'' said Steve Shiffrin, a
Cornell University law professor. ``The First Amendment protects
expression of ideas. It doesn't allow people to block entrance into
a building as a way of expressing those ideas.''
   Many abortion foes, including the National Right to Life
Committee, have long disapproved of Operation Rescue's combative
tactics, concentrating instead on lobbying lawmakers.
   The New York State Catholic Conference also focuses on
legislative action rather than picketing clinics.
   ``We rescue unborn children in a different way,'' said Kathy
Gallagher, associate director of the New York State Catholic
Conference. ``We also want to raise the level of debate to a deeper
level and change social attitudes.''
   Supporters of legalized abortion predicted the rulings will spur
a proliferation of injunction requests by clinics targeted by
Operation Rescue.
   ``We've been telling clinics for a long time the way to go is to
get an injunction, but we couldn't get clinics to move,'' said
Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, which
brought the New York case against Operation Rescue.
   She said the threat of $500-a-day fines for violating an
injunction would discourage demonstrators.
   ``Your troops disappear pretty quickly when they know that's
what they are up against. It's very clear that eventually it's
going to be too expensive for them,'' Yard said.
   Simmons, who is associated with a non-denominational Christian
congregation, agreed fines have been discouraging.
   ``Some of these courts are imposing fines as high as $10,000 per
individual. How many people are willing to protest at that cost?''
he asked. ``We've already noticed the numbers going down as the
judgments go up.''
   Simmons, who is challenging a 45-day jail sentence for violating
a court order not to trespass at a local clinic, said Operation
Rescue's Syracuse chapter will change its tactics. Already it has
taken to picketing the homes of doctors who perform abortions.
   ``Clinic blockades are not the only means of protest. It's just
one tactic. It was effective for a particular time, but no more,''
said Simmons.
   Operation Rescue had to close its national headquarters in
Binghamton this year, selling off its furniture and office
equipment to help pay off $70,000 in debts brought on by its legal
difficulties.
   But Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, has vowed that
his 3-year-old organization will continue to ``rescue'' babies
despite any court injunctions.
   He said there have been 12 to 15 ``rescues'' in the New York
City area since the injunction. ``Every time they rescue they know
they're facing a $25,000 fine and they do it anyway,'' Terry said.

<HEAD>Soldiers Say They Using Restraint in Riots Despite Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JABALIYA CAMP, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers are building
a 20-foot fence around their outpost in this refugee camp, a
reflection of the army's nervousness ever since Palestinians
exploded with anger over the slayings of seven Arab workers by a
lone Israeli.
   In rioting since the slayings Sunday, at least 13 Palestinians
have been fatally shot, prompting an appeal from President Bush for
``maximum restraint.''
   Army commanders insist that soldiers kept their cool and
prevented far worse bloodshed. But critics say the military could
have prevented many casualties, both by being less eager to
confront rioters and by using nonlethal methods of riot control
instead of live ammunition.
   Here in Jabaliya, soldiers said no one was killed in the
outburst following the slayings, which Israel says were committted
by a disturbed former soldier.
   Arab hospital officials said, however, that on Sunday alone, 33
residents of the camp of 53,000 wwere treated for gunshot wounds.
   Col. Meron, the officer in charge of the northern sector of
Gaza, said that bringing in extra troops kept the soldiers from
being overwhelmed and prevented bloodshed.
   ``We brought in many units to put the situation under control.
We had to put it under curfew and keep the people indoors to
prevent killing and to prevent wounding,'' Meron said. ``The
difficult thing is to remain cool.''
   But Giorgio Giocomelli, commissioner-general of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency which administers schools and food aid in the
camps, deplored what he called an excessive use of force by
soldiers.
   He said that although standing orders are to shoot only at the
legs of rioters, 60 percent of the 842 wounded in the first two
days of clashes were hit in the upper body.
   ``We are disturbed that the use of live rounds of ammunition
should have been resorted to so quickly and extensively, and that
the type of wounds inflicted appear to indicate a disregard for
human life,'' he said.
   Army commanders say demonstrations do not disperse by themselves
if left alone, but rather can grow more violent. Therefore, orders
are to disperse youths before they can gather into a mob.
   ``The army is not sitting idly by and hoping that the situation
blows over by itself,'' an army spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said after the recent
rioting erupted that the army would not allow Palestinians to take
control of the streets, as they did in the early days of the
uprising.
   ``I want to warn the public at large in the territories...that
we will in no way allow them to take to the streets,'' he said on
Israel television.
   Avraham Burg, a liberal member of parliament, said the problem
lies not with the soldiers but with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing government, which has failed to satisfy Palestinian
political aspirations.
   ``The answer is very simple. Shamir is responsible for the peace
process stalling,'' Burg said. ``And the minute you stop the peace
dynamic, the war dynamic takes its place.''
   In Jabaliya, where the anti-Israeli uprising began 29 months
ago, black flags of mourning for the massacred laborers still hung
from most shanties Wednesday. A military curfew was still in force,
confining residents to their homes.
   Palestinian women, exempted from the curfew to visit medical
clinics, shouted at the soldiers as they passed, and children
whistled in protest.
   But the soldiers said they do not respond to such provocations.
   ``It's not the first time we are here in the Gaza Strip. We know
more of their tricks now,'' said Dov, a sergeant. ``We don't try to
make any contact with them. If they are whistling, we just let them
whistle.''

   Freight trains were detoured and Amtrak
passengers were put on buses as floodwaters from the Trinity River
surged over Liberty, the last city before the Gulf of Mexico.
   Southern Pacific Railway workers dumped carloads of ballast to
bolster the pilings on its Sunset Route trestle across the Trinity
just outside Liberty. The trestle is part of Amtrak's main route
between New Orleans and Los Angeles.
   ``This is a very difficult situation. We sustained hurricanes,
earthquakes on the West Coast and tornadoes in the Midwest,'' said
Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Johnson. ``It's a battle we're all
in against now of how long can we sustain.''
   Elsewhere, Louisiana and Oklahoma officials said flooding there
caused more than $20 million damage to farms. Officials in Arkansas
assured travelers that holiday weekend visits to state parks
shouldn't be canceled for fear of flood damage.
   In Texas, torrential rains some three weeks ago 200 miles to the
north caused the Trinity on Wednesday to rise to a record depth of
nearly 30 feet in Liberty, officials said. The old record of 29
feet was set in 1942.
   Liberty, population 8,500, is about 16 miles from the Trinity
Bay, which feeds into Galveston Bay and eventually the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Volunteers in Liberty County shored up levees to keep
floodwaters from swamping the expensive Travis Park subdivision and
other parts of the city.
   But the end appeared in sight.
   ``If I had to pick a cutoff day _ a day when this would start
turning around _ it would be today,'' Jim Mitchum, Liberty County
Emergency Management coordinator, said Wednesday. ``I think we're
getting the worst of it now.''
   As Southern Pacific workers maintained a 24-hour vigil to save
the trestle across the river, the company detoured its freight
trains, and Amtrak bused passengers between Houston and New Orleans
to avoid the flood, Johnson said.
   Graham Nance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said
about $1 million in federal money has been distributed to flood
victims. Forty-one Texas counties have been declared eligible for
federal disaster assistance.
   In central Louisiana, officials estimated flooding has caused
more than $10 million damage to farms. Farm Bureau President Ronnie
Anderson said more than 100,000 acres of cropland have been flooded
and more are expected to go under.
   ``There's no doubt that this can be considered a disaster and
we're going to ask Congress as well as Secretary of Agriculture
Clayton Yeutter to declare it so,'' he said.
   Preliminary reports from Oklahoma farmers show at least $8
million in damage to buildings and about $2.5 million to machinery
and equipment, an agriculture official said. Bart Brorsen,
executive director of the state Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, said other losses include more than 2,800
cattle and 30,000 poultry.
   Arkansas tourism officials minimized reports of flood damage.
   ``I think a lot of people are taking it that the whole state is
under water,'' said Richard Davies, interim state Parks and Tourism
Department chief.
   Flash flooding occurred Saturday night in Hot Springs _ one of
the state's top tourist areas _ but the water was gone 24 hours
later. Much of the flooding earlier along the Arkansas and Red
rivers involved farmland.
   Usually, the Memorial Day weekend draws 250,000 people to
Arkansas, and they spend an estimated $34.5 million, Davies said.

<DATELINE>CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News has the poorest record among
the three major networks in promoting women reporters' visibility,
a study indicates.
   The survey of 186 reporters who filed at least five stories in
1989 for ABC, CBS or NBC also found that only eight women were
among the top 100 high-profile correspondents in 1989, compared
with 15 in 1988.
   ``There is an assumption in American society that women are
upwardly mobile in the workplace, but that's not the case in
network television news,'' said Joe S. Foote, chairman of the
radio-TV department at Southern Illinois University.
   The reporters were ranked by the number of stories they had on
the air during 1989.
   Only three women ranked in the top 10, excluding news anchors:
CBS's Lesley Stahl at No. 3, NBC's Andrea Mitchell at No. 4 and
CBS's Rita Braver at No. 8.
   ``There were more women at the top than ever before. That's
unprecedented,'' Foote said Wednesday. ``But there were 50 percent
fewer women overall.''
   There were no ABC women in the top 50. The highest-rated woman
correspondent for ABC was Sheilah Kast at No. 65, and the next was
Bettina Gregory at 96. ``ABC grossly underused its women
correspondents,'' Foote said.
   ABC spokesman Scott Richardson declined to comment on the study
until he had reviewed it, but he questioned the validity of the
survey, noting that the network was the only one with three
prime-time female news anchors.
   ``It doesn't really give much of the big picture,'' he said.
   Ranked No. 1 in visibility was John Cochran of NBC, followed by
Brit Hume of ABC. Stahl, who covers the White House, reached the
highest rank ever for a woman in Foote's seven-year study.
   ``It's a function of the beat,'' Stahl said. ``The White House
beat gets a lot of play.''
   While Stahl was pleased that she had ranked so high, she said
she was disturbed by the small number of women in the top 100. ``We
could always do better,'' she said. ``We still don't have women in
management either.''
   Kast, who covers Congress, said women reporters have been
frustrated with battling ABC to increase their numbers and move
them into high-profile beats.
   ``I would be surprised if there is a conscious bias. What might
be more likely is that news executives are not in the habit of
seeing women in the positions of getting on the air,'' she said.
   The study also found no blacks among the top 50 correspondents
and only two Hispanic correspondents: CBS's Juan Vasquez at No. 16
and ABC's John Quinones at No. 41.
   Information for the study was gleaned from the Vanderbilt
(University) Television News Index in Nashville, Tenn., and
abstracts, Foote said.

   Shoppers worried about higher prices, but some
said they were ready to shell out more rubles to get better
products.
   ``If only we could get some decent stuff, I am ready to pay
more,'' said Vladimir Yashin, a metalworker, as he waited to buy a
$2.75 bottle of wine. ``Anything is better so that I don't have to
stand in line for this trash.''
   Customers had mixed reactions after government officials
proposed a nationwide referendum on whether to switch from a
centrally planned to a regulated market economy. Feelings ranged
from support to anger to apathy.
   Some expressed concern over how the reforms to be voted on will
affect their standard of living, which already lags behind that of
many industrialized countries.
   Many acknowledged they had little understanding of the proposed
reforms or the workings of a market economy. Most government
pronouncements have stressed that people will be compensated for
the higher prices. They have not detailed how much costs will rise,
or why.
   Under the economic proposal, the first shock would come July 1,
when the price of bread would double. President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has said bread is now so artificially cheap that children
use loaves as footballs. Other prices would rise Jan. 1.
   Customers gave little sign of the panic buying that was
predicted by one senior economist after the proposed referendum was
announced.
   Several shoppers said the hoarding of flour, sugar and other
goods has been going on for some time.
   Apathy was evident in stores Wednesday afternoon.
   ``Why should I care about the reforms? I'm getting ready to kick
the bucket,'' said Raisa Okolkova, a 58-year-old cleaning woman
sweeping the cracked white and gray floor tiles of a dingy grocery
store.
   ``The reform will crush me,'' she added, apparently unaware of
the plan to compensate low-income families.
   Another shopper in Grocery No. 44 said that if prices rise, she
will starve on her $130 monthly pension.
   ``Now I can afford to buy meat if I can get it for 2 rubles
($3.20) a kilo (2.2 pounds), and if it soars to six to eight
rubles, I'll have to put my teeth away on a shelf,'' said the
65-year-old woman, who refused to give her name.
   The store seemed to stock only coffee, biscuits, honey, juice,
pickled vegetables and bruised, green Cuban oranges.
   Only two of a dozen banks of flourescent lights were on. The
rest were either broken or off to conserve electricity.
   Reformers say the prices of many items are below production
costs, a problem that discourages increased production or quality.
   Economists have been warning that Soviets will have to suffer
with shortages, hoarding, higher prices and some unemployment for a
few years before the economy gets in shape.

   The Ancient Mariner and the people of
Aruba faced the same plight: Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop
to drink.
   The island nation off Venezuela has a drinking water shortage
because its four processing plants are malfunctioning. Since March
27, the Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co. has drawn a million gallons of
water a day from the Delaware River for shipment to Aruba.
   On Wednesday, the Delaware River Basin Commission renewed an
emergency order allowing the company to continue taking a million
gallons a day for Aruba until January as long as there is a surplus
of water in the river.
   ``The river is spilling over, so it's fine. It doesn't do any
damage,'' said Commissioner Michael Cantania.
   Aruba pays the commission $60 per million gallons.
   The water is drawn into tanker ships docked near Philadelphia.
   ``It's nice to be a good neighbor, particularly when it doesn't
do us any harm,'' Catania said.

<HEAD>Skipper Acquitted of Criminal Liability in Destroyer Collision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military judge ruled the former skipper of
the destroyer USS Kinkaid was not criminally liable for a collision
with a merchant vessel that killed one crewman and injured five
others.
   After an eight-day court-martial, the judge, Capt. Richard Reed,
on Wednesday acquitted Cmdr. John Cochrane of negligence and
dereliction of duty in the Nov. 12 accident off the Malay Peninsula.
   Cochrane had faced up to two years' confinement and dismissal
from the Navy.
   The 44-year-old officer, who had been stripped of his command
one week after the accident, smiled and embraced his attorneys,
then his wife, Suzanne.
   ``I'm not bitter towards the Navy. I love the United States
Navy,'' he said. ``In the end I was exonerated, and it proves the
military justice system works.''
   The judge noted that a Navy skipper's duty to see to the safe
navigation of his ship and well-being of his crew differs from
criminal liability, which demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Prosecutor Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens left immediately after the
verdict without commenting.
   But Cmdr. Danny Barrett, the chief Navy prosecutor in San Diego,
said, ``I don't think this changes anything. A commanding officer
is accountable for his ship and always will be.''
   The San Diego-based Kinkaid and the Panamanian merchant ship
Kota Petani collided in the dark when the destroyer was on the
wrong side of the heavily traveled Strait of Malacca, 240 miles
southwest of Singapore.
   Dickens had argued that Cochrane's weak management style and
failure to follow procedure led to the accident.
   But defense attorney Cmdr. Bayne Smith said Cochrane should not
be held criminally liable for the failings of subordinates.
   Smith argued that the Kinkaid's 24-year-old navigator, Lt. Sean
McPhee, miscalculated the ship's expected arrival time in the
strait. McPhee died in the collision.

   Under pressure from a judge to overhaul
Texas' school finances, the Legislature may be on the verge of
doing something it hasn't done in 11 years _ override a
gubernatorial veto.
   The Texas Senate voted 23-8 along party lines Wednesday night to
override Gov. Bill Clements' veto of a $555 million school finance
reform plan.
   House Speaker Gib Lewis predicted his chamber would follow suit.
If two-thirds of the 150-member House vote to override Clements'
veto, the reform plan becomes law over the governor's objections.
   No Texas governor's veto has been rebuffed since 1979, when the
Legislature overrode Clements' rejection of a minor bill on hunting
and fishing regulations.
   Lewis didn't say how soon the House would attempt an override.
But the current special session _ lawmakers' third on school
finance _ ends May 31.
   The Legislature had previously passed the bill to meet a
unanimous Texas Supreme Court order to make more money available to
poor school districts. But the governor vetoed it over plans for a
half-cent increase in the 6-cent sales tax.
   The state faces a June 1 court deadline for action. If the
Democrat-controlled Legislature and the GOP governor don't adopt a
plan by then, a court-appointed master will write one for them,
state District Judge Scott McCown ruled earlier this month.
   In urging the override, Democrat Carl Parker said the bill
wasn't perfect but was a compromise that would end a nearly
three-month stalemate between the Legislature and the governor.
   ``We're looking silly before the nation for not making
provisions for future generations,'' he said.
   Clements condemned the Senate vote, saying the bill would cause
property taxes to skyrocket. ``This is totally unacceptable,
especially when alternatives clearly exist,'' he said.
   The overhaul was made necessary when the Texas Supreme Court
declared the current finance system unconstitutional because of
wide disparities in spending between rich and poor districts.
   As in most states, school spending in Texas is based primarily
on property taxes.
   Courts in a dozen states have overturned school finance systems
in recent years. The others are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas,
Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia,
Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.

   Only a narrow range of white blood cells may be
involved in triggering multiple sclerosis, scientists said today in
a finding hailed as a major step in understanding the crippling
nerve disease.
   Researchers found surprisingly few types of those cells when
they analyzed diseased brain tissue from multiple sclerosis
patients, said study co-author Dr. Lawrence Steinman of Stanford
University.
   The disease results when the body's disease-fighting immune
system mistakenly attacks nerve tissue in the brain and central
nervous system. Research suggests that white blood cells called
T-cells play a critical role in the onslaught.
   The new findings imply that the disease may be treatable with
strategies that block just the types of T-cells cells involved in
that attack, Steinman said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   The work is a major step toward better understanding of the
disease, said Stephen Reingold, vice president for research and
medical programs of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   It would be ``very attractive indeed'' to be able to block just
disease-causing blood cells, rather than risking side effects from
experimental drugs that more broadly affect the immune system, he
said.
   But Reingold stressed that the new study included only three
patients, so that its importance for multiple sclerosis in general
is not clear, and he said it left other key questions unanswered.
   He also said any implication for therapy would be far in the
future.
   The study is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by researchers at Stanford, LaTrobe University in Australia
and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville, Calif.
   An estimated 250,000 Americans have MS, an often disabling
condition that can produce weakness, difficulty in coordination,
dizziness and loss of balance.
   The study's authors focused on structures called receptors that
are found on the surface of T-cells. The cells use receptors to
bind to their targets, and the targets they can attack are
determined by the types of receptor they carry.
   Using one criterion for describing receptors, researchers
analyzed types of T-cell receptors in diseased brain tissue from
three MS patients. They found two to four receptor types in each
brain.
   In contrast, there may be 20 to 30 such receptor types used by
T-cells in the body, with the exact number not known, commented Dr.
Henry McFarland of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke.
   In the new study, one receptor type showed up in all three
patients. T-cells bearing that type are not very common in blood,
at least in people without multiple sclerosis, Steinman said.
   The restricted number of receptor types found in the brain
suggests the T-cells are ``targeting something very, very specific
in the brain,'' Steinman said in a telephone interview. The target
is not known, he said.
   Researchers might be able to develop a therapy that blocks
T-cells carrying the receptors implicated in the disease, he said.
   Such a strategy successfully treated mice with a disease
resembling multiple sclerosis, the Nature paper noted. Researchers
used proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bound to particular
types of T-cells.
   The new study left some questions unanswered, experts said.
Reingold said it is not clear whether similar T-cell findings would
appear in brains of people with similar diseases, which would mean
the findings are not specific to multiple sclerosis. Steinman said
researchers are checking on that.
   Dr. Stephen Hauser of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston cautioned that treatment the patients
received before the study may have destroyed other types of T-cells
that also participate in the disease. Steinman said if that is so,
the fact the observed T-cells survived may mean ``they're the ones
we really have to focus on'' for therapy.

   Africa's misery is deepening even as living
conditions slowly improve in much of the Third World, according to
a study released today.
   The report by the U.N. Development Program said Africans lead
shorter lives and have the worst infant mortality and literacy
rates of all developing regions.
   ``In any concerted international effort to improve human
development in the Third World, priority must go to Africa,'' said
Mahbub ul Haq, principal author of the report.
   The study rated personal well-being in 130 countries based on a
formula combining life expectancy, adult literacy and per-capita
income. Of the 44 countries the study listed as having low ``human
development,'' 33 are in Africa.
   The African nation with the highest rating was Mauritius, ranked
No. 49.
   The continent's per-capita income fell by a quarter in the
1980s, and more than half of all Africans now live in poverty,
according to the report.
   Africans account for a quarter of the world's extremely poor,
while representing less than 10 percent of the population, the
study found. The study predicted nearly 400 million people there
will be living in extreme poverty by 1995, up from 250 million in
1985.
   Life expectancy at birth in sub-Saharan Africa is only 51 years,
compared with 62 for all developing nations and 74 for
industrialized countries, the report said.
   Only 45 percent of Africans have access to health services, and
only 37 percent have access to safe drinking water.
   The report notes significant progress in the developing world
during the 30-year period ending in 1987. Life expectancy rose from
46 years in 1960 to 62 in 1987, the under-5 mortality rate was
halved and primary health care was extended to 62 percent of the
population.
   Arica's 3.1 percent population growth rate exceeds the 2 percent
average for all developing countries. But the net amount of aid
from richer countries has declined, largely because of Africa's
debt payments, the report said.

   They cheered when the fat barkeep Jock
was shot. They booed when drug-dealing Leo threatened to torch his
wife. And they said, ``Goodbye!'' when eye-patched Nadine
threatened suicide.
   More than 100 fans of the broodingly comic ABC series ``Twin
Peaks'' gathered Wednesday night in the Salish Lodge _ the
real-life counterpart of the show's Great Northern lodge _ to watch
the season-ending episode.
   Much of the series was shot in this small Pacific Northwest
logging town about 30 miles east of Seattle.
   The audience sat glued to the three glowing screens in the
basement ballroom of the Salish, gorging as lustily on cherry pie,
doughnuts and coffee as any of the ``Twin Peaks'' townies.
   ``It's great. It's twisted like me and all my friends,'' said
Annie Raye, who came dressed as the character Nadine, down to the
makeshift patch over her left eye.
   ``Nadine knows a lot she's not telling,'' Ms. Raye said,
referring to the unsolved murder of the character Laura Palmer in
the show. ``Nadine has spent time alone with the log.''
   The log, for those uninitiated in the hour-long series that will
return in the fall, is usually carried by the ``log lady,'' a
psychic who talks with it for insight.
   Locals say ``Twin Peaks,'' with its dueling-chainsaw loggers,
satanic cults and macabre death plots, has little to do with the
real Snoqualmie. But they're addicted anyway.
   Garnet Cross, who bakes pies for the cafe immortalized by the
show _ the Mar-T in nearby North Bend _ was given a front row seat
at Wednesday's gathering.
   Ms. Cross, who has baked pies for 50 years, said the demand for
her authentic cherry pies has exploded since FBI agent Dale Cooper
first smacked his lips over the Double R Diner's cherry pie in the
``Twin Peaks'' pilot.
   She said people include the Mar-T on trips to Washington now,
and she's had requests to mail pies out of state. ``This is the
best thing that's happened to me,'' she said.
   Mar-T owner Pat Cokewell said: ``We used to sell about one a
week. Now we sell as many as she makes.''
   The ballroom gathering was organized by radio station KLSY,
which has started calling itself the official ``Twin Peaks''
station.
   Announcer Tim Hunter said he got hooked after watching the first
episode. He said he received more than 200 calls when he asked if
listeners wanted the station to recap the show each week.
   That led to a radio contest, and winners got to come to the
season-finale party in real ``Twin Peaks'' territory.
   At least one local wasn't happy with the show. Louis Delicino
looked harried in his Salish Lodge tuxedo shirt and bow tie as he
rushed from table to table delivering plates of cherry pie.
   Pausing with three plates balanced on his left arm and two more
in his right, the Snoqualmie native said, ``This is surely madness
over a TV show that has no connection to real life.''

   Poorer countries such as Sri Lanka and Costa
Rica have a higher quality of life than wealthier ones such as
Brazil because they put the poor ahead of the middle class or the
military, a U.N. study says.
   The report released today by the U.N. Development Program found
that nations such as Sri Lanka, Costa Rica and Botswana had a
relatively high quality of life despite low gross national products.
   But Brazil, Pakistan and Nigeria have ``conspicuously failed''
in using their resources to promote human well-being, the report
said.
   The report calculated 130 nations' ``human development index''
by charting life expectancy, adult literacy and purchasing power
over a 30-year period ending in 1987.
   Japan parlayed its unparalleled prosperity into the top rating,
although there was little difference in the rankings of
industrialized countries. Niger, with an average income of $452 per
person, ranked last.
   ``There's been tremendous progress in developing nations in the
last 30 years, but there's also been complacency. There is a huge
backlog of human deprivation in the developing world,'' said
project director Mahbub ul Haq.
   Sri Lanka, with its longtime commitment to health and education
spending, ``shows best that human development can be reached on
fairly low income,'' the study said.
   Its gross national product is only 92nd among the 130 countries,
but the country ranked 47th on the human development index, higher
than wealthier countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya and Brazil.
Sri Lanka had 87 percent literacy and a life expectancy of 71
years, compared with 43 percent and 59 years for neighboring India.
   ``We've had a few economic troubles and internal troubles, but
we have continued to emphasize education and helping the poor,''
said A.G. Rana Singhe of Sri Lanka's U.N. mission. ``If we provide
poor children with an education, someday the whole country will
come out of poverty.''
   Costa Rica, which has no standing army, ranks a high 28th
because its life expectancy is 75 years, its literacy rate is 93
percent and its adjusted average income is $3,760.
   Botswana's human development is among the highest in Africa,
reflected in its 67 percent literacy rate and a track record of
speedy relief for drought-stricken villages.
   By contrast, Brazil has a life expectancy of 65 years, a 78
percent literacy rate and relatively high child mortality despite
high incomes, rapid economic growth and substantial social
spending. The report blames the ``extreme inequality'' of income
distribution and public subsidy programs that benefit middle-income
people more than the poor.
   The report notes significant progress in the developing world
over the 30-year period. Life expectancy rose from 46 years in 1960
to 62 in 1987, the under-5 mortality rate was halved and primary
health care was extended to 62 percent of the population.
   But it notes an ``immense backlog of human deprivation,''
particularly in Africa and Latin America.
   ``There still are more than a billion people in absolute
poverty, nearly 900 million adults unable to read and write, 1.75
billion without safe drinking water, around 100 million completely
homeless, some 800 million who go hungry every day, 150 million
children under 5 who are malnourished and 14 million children who
die each year before their fifth birthday,'' the report said.
   Among other findings:
   _ There are eight times more soldiers than physicians in the
Third World; physicians outnumber soldiers in developed countries.
   _ The literacy rate for females in developing countries is only
three-quarters that of males, although it has narrowed slightly in
the last three decades. And women typically work about 25 percent
longer hours than men in developing nations but are paid less.

<TEXT>
   Canadian truck drivers blocked
commercial border crossings to protest proposed tax increases and
the U.S.-Canadian free-trade agreement but said their gripe isn't
with American truckers.
   More than 300 truckers parked their rigs along more than three
miles of the highway leading to the Ambassador Bridge on Wednesday.
About two dozen rigs also were on the bridge, blocking truck
traffic from Detroit.
   In Sarnia, hundreds of truckers at the Blue Water Bridge idled
their rigs, putting truck traffic between Sarnia and Port Huron,
Mich., on hold.
   Authorities at the bridges said cars were crossing without delay.
   The Ontario protests began Tuesday. Quebec truckrs, meanwhile,
continued to prevent U.S. trucks from leaving or entering the
province. That protest began Monday.
   The protests were over planned increases in Canadian taxes on
everything from the goods they haul to the tires, insurance and
diesel fuel they buy, said Canadian truckers gathered near a fast
food restaurant.
   The Canadian drivers complain that U.S. drivers can undercut
them because they aren't paying nearly as much in taxes. The
U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove by 1999 almost all
tariffs on goods crossing the border, will further handicap
Canadian truckers, they said.
   ``We want the government to take some of these taxes off of
us,'' said Hollie Greer, a trucker from Harrow who parked his truck
in the row of rigs along Huron Church Street in Windsor. ``They are
taxing us to death.''
   Greer, a driver for Can Truck of Windsor, said organizers of the
protest estimated that an American driver can run a load from
Flint, Mich., about 350 miles, for $1.16 a mile. A Canadian driver
would pay about $2.36 a mile.
   ``They are coming over, taking good loads ... and all they are
leaving behind is unemployment,'' Greer said. He and other Canadian
drivers stressed, however, that the protest wasn't against U.S.
drivers but Canadian government policy.
   ``We've got nothing against the Americans going over there,''
said Murray Harvey of Windsor, whose rig was one of those on the
Canada-bound side of the Ambassador Bridge. ``Just do it for the
same price we are doing it for.''
   The free-trade agreement was signed last year.
   U.S. automakers whose plants were awaiting parts were keeping a
close watch on the protest.
   ``There will probably be some minor and very short disruptions
in our system,'' said Ford Motor Co. spokesman Jim McGraw. The
automaker has about 110 suppliers in southern Ontario.
   Canadian automakers also were concerned.
   ``There's no question it's a tight situation,'' said Chrysler
Canada Ltd. spokesman Walter McCall. ``We're watching this as a
shift-by-shift basis.''

   Rain fell on the tip of Florida and in the Pacific Northwest
early today, and strong gusts swept the Rockies.
   Scattered thunderstorms were over the central Plains, and early
morning fog across the South was expected to burn off in strong
sunshine.
   Strong gusts were reported at Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, and
gusts up to 50 mph were expected in the southern Rockies.
   Temperatures in the lower-than-normal 60s were forecast today
from the Great Lakes region to the Northeast. Thunderstorms were
forecast in Florida, and behind a cold front moving across the
Rockies from Colorado to Montana.
   Temperatures in western Texas were to soar into the 100s.
   Scattered showers were forecast in the Rockies, Midwest and
parts of the Northeast. Some rain was also forecast for the
Carolinas and Virginia.
   On Wednesday, summertime thunderstorms were over the Plains.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted late Wednesday for parts
of Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado.
   As much as 4 inches of snow fell in the higher elevations of the

   Organizers of the Goddess of Democracy
radio ship said today they have canceled plans to beam
pro-democracy messages to China because of setbacks in obtaining
crucial broadcasting equipment.
   ``It was a difficult decision. We are forced to abandon the
broadcasting project,'' said Xu Tianfang, deputy secretary of the A
Boat for China Association, one of the main organizers.
   He said organizers would sell the ship at auction and distribute
tapes of the planned broadcasts to radio stations that can help
transmit the messages to China.
   The organizers said they formally announce the decision at news
conferences in Taipei and Tokyo Friday.
   They had hoped to begin broadcasting to China before June 4, the
first anniversary of China's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement. The ship takes its name from a statue built by students
in Tiananmen Square during the demonstrations.
   Organizers have accused the Taiwan government of scuttling the
project by refusing to allow Chinese to board the ship to make
broadcasts and by holding up the transmitter. Authorities here also
have said they would not allow the ship to return for supplies once
it has left port.
   The Taiwan government said it supported efforts to foster
democracy in China but could not support the planned broadcasts,
which it said were against the law.
   Organizers have rejected the claim that their broadcasts would
violate international law.
   Although Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party is the sworn enemy of
the Beijing government, tensions between the two sides have eased
in recent years and Taiwan is anxious not to anger Beijing.
   The 1,200-ton ship, sponsored by the French magazine Actuel and
other publishing organizations and backed by the Paris-based
Federation for a Democratic China, a dissident Chinese group, left
France on March 17. It arrived in Keelung harbor in northern Taiwan
May 13 to take on supplies, including a transmitter sent from
France.
   But Taiwanese customs authorities refused to release the
transmitter on grounds that unauthorized radio broadcasts, even
from international waters, would violate international agreements.
   On Wednesday, the ship delayed its departure for Japan as
customs officials demanded export permits for fax machines,
telephones and other equipment that was to be loaded aboard.
   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said Wednesday
that Japan would not allow the Goddess of Democracy to enter its
ports because of the ship's plan to make unauthorized broadcasts.
   The ship had planned to head for Japan in hopes of obtaining the
necessary radio transmitter there.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Report Blames Oil Spill on Water-Depth Ignorance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure to update water-depth charts
caused a 400,000-gallon crude oil spill that blackened miles of
scenic Southern California beaches, a final Coast Guard report
concluded.
   The refinery operating the offshore oil pipeline mooring and
ship's pilots who guide tankers to it were blamed for the February
spill in the report released Wednesday.
   The 818-foot tanker American Trader, carrying 568,000 gallons of
oil, was maneuvering in water shallower than shown in 1975 depth
charts when an ocean swell caused it to gash itself on its own
anchor, the report said.
   The spill took place about 1{ miles offshore in an area where
shifting sand bars can alter water depth.
   Golden West Refining Co. of Santa Fe Springs failed to survey
the mooring depth regularly, the report said. And mooring master
Capt. John Keon, along with his employer, Capt. Robert
Brandenburger, failed ``to be fully cognizant of accurate sea berth
water depth information.''
   A mooring master is an independent local captain hired by vessel
operators to guide large ships to offshore moorings.
   Refinery officials knew that depth surveys taken in 1981 and
1983 showed the water depth was no more than 52 feet, the report
said. Pilots believed the water was 56 feet deep.
   The tanker's draft, or portion below water, was 43 feet, while
its anchor point stood about 4 feet above the bottom, leaving at
most a 5-foot distance between the hull of the ship and the anchor
tip, the report said.
   Ocean swells the day of the accident ranged from 3 feet to 5
feet.
   Capt. David Whitten, director of the Coast Guard's marine vessel
inspection office, said more frequent surveys would have shown the
water had become too shallow to accommodate the tanker.
   The oil spill fouled two harbors and about 15 miles of Orange
County shoreline. Up to 450 oil-soaked birds died.
   Roger Kemple, a senior vice president at Golden West, declined
to comment Wednesday, saying he had not seen the report.
Brandenburger also would not comment. Keon was at sea and could not
be reached.
   The report exonerated the tanker operator, British Petroleum Oil
Shipping Co. USA, and the crew of the American Trader and its
captain, A.R. LaWare, of responsibility in the spill.
   The Coast Guard said it would take no action against Keon or
Golden West, who violated no laws ``for which the Coast Guard has
enforcement responsibility.''
   But it said the tanker's owner, New York-based American Trading
and Transport Co., may have violated the federal Water Pollution
Control Act by dumping crude oil into the ocean.
   In April, the Coast Guard announced it would require monthly
depth soundings at the mooring, as well as checks before each
tanker arrival.

membership in the ruling Communist Party, and also the Ho Chi Minh
Order, the state's highest distinction.
   The radio said he held the vice premiership in the Socialist

   Tobacco company stocks worth $3.5 million will
be sold by City University of New York in a protest move similar to
one at Harvard University.
   ``The policy is that the university will divest itself of its
stocks in companies that manufacture cigarettes,'' CUNY spokeswoman
Rita Rodin said Wednesday. ``They will do it in a way that will not
adversely affect the university's portfolio.''
   Smoking's health risks prompted the vote taken Monday at the
school board's monthly meeting, Ms. Rodin said. The vote was 9-2.
   The university has a $60 million portfolio and stocks in tobacco
companies are worth about $3.5 million, she said.
   Harvard decided to sell its stock in tobacco companies last
September and finished in March, university President Derek Bok has
said.
   The sale was revealed May 18 in a letter to three Harvard School
of Public Health students, who had been demanding the university
sell its investments in companies manufacturing cigarettes.

   Following is the full text of a speech given by
Emperor Akihito at a banquet Thursday to honor visiting South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo. The English translation was provided
by the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
   Your excellency, the president of the Republic of Korea:
   Your excellency has come to pay a visit to this country with
Mrs. Roh Tae-woo in spite of the heavy pressure of affairs of
state. It is a matter of great significance and cause of utmost
pleasure to me to be able to receive as a state guest your
excellency the president, who has led your country to its
remarkable development. I wish to offer my heartfelt welcome to
your excellency and your party.
   The Korean Peninsula and Japan, since ancient times, have
maintained close contact as the nearest neighbors. Even during the
Edo period when Japan kept its doors closed to the outside world,
Japan continued to receive Korean missions and all the Japanese
people cordially welcomed them. However, while looking back upon
the history of long, fruitful exchanges between the Korean
Peninsula and Japan, I recall what was stated by the late Emperor
Showa: ``It is indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate
past between us for a period in this century and I believe it
should not be repeated again.'' I think of the sufferings your
people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.
   Having gone through such an era, the relationship between our
two countries has been restored to normality, thanks to the staunch
enthusiasm of those people in both countries, in all circles and at
all levels, who have wishes for the revival of Japan-Korea
friendship, and we now witness friendly and cooperative relations
in all fields. To all those concerned, I should like to express my
profound respect.
   Both Japan and the Republic of Korea have now come to be
expected to play important roles for the peace and prosperity of
the world. I earnestly hope that the people of our two countries
will further deepen their mutual understanding, make the relations
between the two countries increasingly mature, and jointly respond
to this challenge.
   I feel particularly reassured to see active exchanges between
young people, who are to take over responsibility in the coming
age, and the emergence from these exchanges of a new friendship to
unite the two countries. This new friendship will be the groundwork
for the two countries to join forces in making a significant
contribution to the future of mankind.
   I believe that your excellency's current visit will lay a
foundation for such a new relationship between our two countries
that will continue into the 21st century.
   I understand that your excellency will also visit the Kansai
area. Fortunately, this is the season of fresh, pleasant greenery.
It is my ardent hope that your excellency will find your stay in
this country agreeable and meaningful.
   May I now propose a toast to the good health and happiness of
your excellency the president and Mrs. Roh Tae-woo, and to the
further prosperity of the people of the Republic of Korea.

   Following is the full text of a speech by South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo during a banquet at the Imperial
Palace in Tokyo Thursday. The English translation was provided by
the South Korean government.
   Your majesties the emperor and empress, esteemed members of the
imperial family, your excellencies Prime Minister and Mrs. Kaifu,
distinguished guests.
   I am grateful to you for so warmly welcoming my wife and me and
honoring us with this splendid dinner. I am also thankful for your
majesty's warm and friendly remarks about my country and people.
   It is a great pleasure for me to visit Japan as it is opening
the new Heisei era with your ascension to the throne. And I
consider it of utmost significance that today, I have this historic
opportunity to get to know your majesty and personally congratulate
you on your becoming emperor. I pay tribute to Japan for having
risen from the ashes of war and rebuilt itself into a peaceful and
prosperous nation that is the envy of the world. I am convinced
that the Heisei era will see peace, prosperity and fellowship
enhanced not only in Japan but also throughout East Asia and the
whole world beyond.
   From time immemorial to the present, the two countries of Korea
and Japan have had close contacts as next-door neighbors. Through
interaction across a narrow strait, our peoples have significantly
influenced each other's cultural development. We have shared many
good things together but in more modern times, we experienced a
painful phase also. Compared with the long history of neighborly
and amicable association, however, the dark period was a relatively
short one.
   It is not possible to erase or forget historical facts.
Nevertheless, we must not remain bound up in memories. Our two
nations must now forge a new era of friendship and cooperation
based on a proper historical perspective, putting the unfortunate
past truly behind us. It is significant that your majesty, the
symbol of Japanese history and the new Japanese nation, has shown
deep concern about this matter.
   To ensure that our two nations will become close neighbors in
spirit as well as geographically, all of us now should strive to
remove the dark shadow of history and negative residues of the past
that have stood in the way of developing our bilateral ties. In
that way, we should be able to bequeath wholesome bilateral ties to
our posterity.
   Your majesty, the 21st century is now fast approaching in the
midst of tremendous upheavals. The burning human desire for freedom
and prosperity has rubbled the Cold War structure, drastically
reshaping the global political landscape. Freedom and democracy,
ideals which both Korea and Japan have been pursuing, have begun to
prevail as universal values.
   It has long been predicted that the 21st century will be the
Asia-Pacific age. In the world today, the relationship between
Korea and Japan is therefore not a matter of importance for our two
countries alone. For our two nations ought to combine our efforts
to take a leading role in promoting peace and prosperity throughout
the Asia-Pacific region, an area which will become the cradle of a
new civilization harmoniously blending things East and West.
Furthermore, our two nations should together make ever greater
contributions to global prosperity and well-being. This, I believe,
is our responsibility before humanity and history.
   Looking back, Hoshu Amenomori, who was in charge of Japanese
relations with the Choson Kingdom some 270 years ago, had as his
motto: ``Sincerity and good faith.'' Hyon Tog-Yun, his Korean
counterpart, built Songshindang, the Hall of Sincerity and Good
Faith, in Tongnae, and met Japanese envoys there. Likewise, I am
confident our bilateral ties will develop in the future in a spirit
of mutual respect and understanding in pursuit of shared ideals and
values.
   I believe the future of Korea-Japan relations will be bright so
long as we endeavor together with good faith and trust to build our
ties from a global perspective. As an Oriental sage said: ``The
relationship between true gentlemen is placid, just like calm
water.'' I believe friendly relations between our two nations
should be like that also.
   Distinguished guests, please join me in toasting the good
health, longevity and well-being of their majesties and the
boundless prosperity of Japan in the newly opened Heisei era.
   Thank you.

<HEAD>Regional Railway Strike Threatens Poland Economic Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to UPDATE with strike spreading to
another port, workers' negotiator en route to Warsaw. Pickup 10th

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wildcat strike that has halted rail
service to Poland's busiest port and threatened the nation's new
economic reform program today spread eastward along the Baltic
coast, the official news agency said.
   In an apparent effort to win a settlement, the government
announced today that it had fired the director of the railway
district in northwest Poland where the strike began Sunday night.
But when negotiations with unions began today, the delegation
representing the wildcat strikers did not appear.
   The negotiations involve the labor minister, the railway
management, the Solidarity railway chapter, and other unions,
according to Transport Ministry spokesman Stefan Pozniak.
   The labor unrest, including hunger strikes by 50 workers, has
produced a ``full blockade'' of rail traffic throughout the
Pomeranian region along the Baltic coast, including Poland's
busiest port of Szczecin, railroad spokesman Jacek Wnukowski said.
   PAP, the official news agency, said the strike spread today to
the rail station in the port of Gydnia, 220 miles east of Szczecin.
   In all, a dozen key railroad junctures and a locomotive repair
shop were idled, and traffic from the industrial south to the ports
was disrupted.
   The army was moving perishable goods and essential supplies
stalled by the four days of strikes, and the government is trying
to route shipments away from the area affected by the strike.
   The government, faced with the most serious challenge yet to its
5-month-old economic reform plan, invited the rail unions to bring
a three-member delegation from the wildcat strike committee to the
talks in Warsaw in what appeared to be a conciliatory gesture
Wednesday.
   Pozniak said it was not known why the delegation did not
participate.
   A spokesman for the strike committee based in Slupsk said one
representative left this morning for Warsaw, 260 miles to the
southeast, but it was not known when he would arrive.
   The strikers, who wanted government negotiators to meet with
them in Slupsk, said on Wednesday night that they were divided
about whether to join the government talks.
   The government refuses to negotiate directly with the workers
because their strike was not endorsed by any union, and it has
ruled out immediate pay raises, saying the demands would undermine
the post-Communist reforms.
   Solidarity's leadership has called the strike a ``strong
warning'' to the government it helped create but urged workers to
negotiate a return to work.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of the
dramatic overhaul of the socialist economy, assured parliament this
morning that Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his top advisers
``consider it necessary to speed up reforms aimed at streamlining
the railroad's organization and reducing administrative workers.''
   In addition to seeking pay raises to 110 percent of the average
national pay of about $80 monthly, the strikers are seeking the
dismissal of directors of the state-run railroad installed by the
former Communist regime. They contend the old guard is incompetent
and hampering reforms.
   The dismissed Pomerania director, Stefan Maksymow, was a deputy
in the district before taking charge in August, the Transport
Ministry said.
   The railway restructuring plan in the works before the strike
includes new pay scales, based on the results of the reforms and
the inflation rate, Balcerowicz said. But he added, ``The
government cannot meet salary demands that negate the possibility
of success for the economic program.''
   The drive to create a market-driven economy has cut government
subsidies to state-run enterprises and barred pay raises that
cannot be supported by the companies. The government has vowed to
make no exceptions to the reform program implemented Jan. 1.
   The strict wage controls, coupled with the raising of prices to
market levels after years at unrealistically low rates based on
government subsidies, has reduced Poles' real incomes by an
estimated 40 percent.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Thursday.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well today, after long and thorough
deliberation, I have determined that MFN status, trade status for
China, should be extended for a year.
   MFN is not a special favor, it's not a concession, it's the
basis of everyday trade. And taking MFN away is one thing I said I
would not do _ that is, in doing that take steps that would hurt
the Chinese people themselves. I do not want to do that.
   To express America's outrage at the tragedy of Tiananmen, the
Congress and my administration promptly enacted sanctions against
China. These sanctions remain basically unchanged today. And while
implementing those sanctions I have repeatedly made clear that I
did not want to hurt the Chinese people.
   And this was a difficult decision, weighing our impulse to lash
out in outrage that we all feel against a sober assessment _
weighing that against a sober assessment of our nation's long-term
interests. I concluded that it is in our best interest and the
interest of the Chinese people to continue China's trade status.
Not to do so would hurt the United States. Trade would drop,
dramatically hurting exporters, consumers and investors.
   China buys about $6 billion a year of American aircraft and
wheat and chemicals, lumber and other products. Lose this market
and we lose American jobs _ aircraft workers in the West, farmers
in the Great Plains, high tech employees in the Northeast.
   Our economic competition will not join us in denying MFN.
Without MFN an average of 40 percent higher costs for Chinese
imports will turn into higher prices for American consumers.
   Hong Kong weighed on my mind. Hong Kong would be an innocent
victim of our dispute with Beijing _ 20,000 jobs and $10 billion
could be lost in a colony that is a model of free enterprise spirit.
   The United Kingdom and China's neighbors have urged me to
continue MFN. Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, even Taiwan made
clear that MFN should be retained.
   In recent weeks China has taken modest steps that appear
intended to show responsiveness to our concerns. Beijing lifted
martial law in Tibet, restored consular access there, giving us a
chance to judge the situation for ourselves; 211 detainees were
recently released and then their names provided for the first time.
   While we welcome these and earlier steps, they are, let's face
it, far from adequate, and I am not basing my decision on the steps
that the Chinese have taken so far. Most important of all, as we
mark the anniversary of Tiananmen, we must realize that by
maintaining our involvement with China we will continue to promote
the reforms for which the victims of Tiananmen gave their lives.
The people in China who trade with us are the engine of reform
opening to the outside world.
   During the past 10 years we've seen our engagement in China
contribute to the forces for justice and reason that were
peacefully protested in Beijing, and our responsibility to them is
best met not by isolating those forces from contact with us or by
strengthening the hand of reaction, but by keeping open the
channels of commerce and communication.
   Our Ambassador came to see me here in the Oval Office the other
day and told me that not only the people that he is in contact
with, but the students there, the intellectuals there, all favor _
there in China, favor the continuation of MFN.
   So, this is why I made the decision I have made, and I will be
glad to respond to questions. I understand, Helen, you are first.
   Q: Mr. President, every day the American people read a different
figure on the savings and loan debacle. What is the true figure?
What are you going to _ what does it all mean? What are you going
to do about it? And what is the impact on the average taxpayer? Do
you know the true figure?

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and

   He said the officials discussed ``a wide range of issues,''
including economic and trade relations and possible NATO membership
for a future united Germany, which Moscow so far has ruled out.
   The one-day meeting at the Soviet mission to the United Nations
was the second between the foreign ministers in three weeks. West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said they agreed to
meet again, on a date to be determined.
   Shevardnadze denied reports suggesting Moscow is tying
acceptance of an East-West pact on cutting conventional forces to
an agreement on the size of the armed forces in a united Germany.
   ``We did discuss cuts in armed forces and armament in Europe,
from the Atlantic to the Urals,'' he told reporters. ``The first
priority is of course to sign a treaty on conventional cuts in
Europe.''
   Shevardnadze said both sides favored speeding up the Vienna
talks on conventional forces. The West has accused the Soviets of
stalling.
   ``We advocated an acceleration of the Vienna negotiations,'' he
said.
   Shevardnadze said there was a ``useful discussion'' on the
question of whether a united Germany should belong to NATO. ``That
is a very tricky issue and I don't think that you can expect an
agreement to be achieved right now.''
   On military issues, Moscow has taken a hard line in the
so-called ``two-plus-four'' talks on German unity. They include the
two German states and the four World War II allies _ the Soviet
Union, the United States, Britain and France.
   The Soviets, fearing the re-emergence of a military superpower
at the heart of Europe, are pressing to negotiate the size of a
united Germany's armed forces in the six-nation talks.
   West Germany wants to wrap up those negotiations by the end of
the year. In a major step last Friday, East and West Germany signed
an accord to merge into a single economy on July 2.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Subpoena Diane Sawyer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Television journalist Diane Sawyer has been
subpoenaed to appear at Imelda Marcos' fraud trial to testify about
an interview she did with the former Philippine first lady in 1986,
prosecutors said.
   In a May 22 letter to U.S. District Judge John Keenan,
prosecutors said they want Sawyer to ``authenticate'' a segment of
her interview that they plan to present as evidence.
   Sawyer conducted the interview while working for the CBS News
show, ``60 Minutes.''
   A CBS attorney, Helen Gold, said the network would ask the judge
to quash the subpoena, which is returnable Friday.
   Sawyer is now employed by ABC. A spokeswoman there said Sawyer
had no comment.
   In the segment, Mrs. Marcos denied writing the signature on a
Swiss bank record. The document, which is already in evidence at
the trial, reflects the opening of an account in the name ``Jne
Ryan.''
   Prosecutors claim ``Jane Ryan'' is a fictitious name for Mrs.
Marcos. They said the handwriting on the document has been
identified as Mrs. Marcos'.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorneys are seeking to keep the jury from seeing
the tape or hearing Sawyer's testimony. They argue that the March
21, 1986, bank document predates the start of the alleged
conspiracy for which Mrs. Marcos is on trial.
   The interview, taped in Hawaii, was conducted after Mrs. Marcos'
husband, Ferdinand E. Marcos, was ousted as president of the
Philippines in Feb. 1986. It aired on Sept. 21, 1986.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband embezzle
more than $220 million from their country's treasury to secretly
buy four New York properties and artwork.

   About 5,000 demonstrators defied a
government ban today and protested what they claimed was the
governing party's fraudulent victory in Romania's first multiparty
elections after 44 years of communism.
   ``Down with Iliescu!'' they shouted in a downtown square that
has been the focus of anti-government and anti-Communist protests
for a month.
   The government of President-elect Ion Iliescu had said the
protest was unauthorized, and police detained three people who
helped organize the rally. Only a few traffic police were in sight
when the demonstration began, however.
   Opposition leaders say Iliescu's National Salvation Front is led
by ex-Communists who they believe stole Sunday's election. Numerous
foreign observers pointed to voting irregularities, but most said
they did not significantly affect the outcome.
   One of three rally organizers was detained in the southern town
of Lehliu carrying 40,000 leaflets, police said. The other two were
detained in Bucharest, a spokesman for the police press department
told The Associated Press. He said the three were only identified
and not charged, but he declined to say if they were later released.
   For the third day, police appealed to citizens to turn in anyone
seen distributing the handbills.
   Premier Petre Roman told reporters Wednesday the demonstration
against the National Salvation Front has blocked central University
Square for 33 days and was ``impermissible'' now that ``the
government had the legitimacy of being elected.''
   When Iliescu was asked if he would send police to clear the
square, he told reporters he would apply ``no force ... I hope.''
   Crowds of several hundred to several thousand have filled the
square each day, chanting ``Down With Communism!'' Club-wielding
police briefly broke up the protest a few days after it started,
but they have since left it alone.
   At the news conference, Iliescu reiterated his claim that he has
made a complete break with his Communist past. Iliescu was a
minister in the government of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu but fell
out with him in the 1970s. Ceausescu was toppled and executed in
the December revolution.
   Iliescu said he wants the new government to include ``competent
people, regardless of party affiliation.''
   ``Romania's break with communism was the most brusque and
revolutionary in all East Europe,'' the president-elect said.
``There is no way back, and to try such a thing would be political
suicide.''
   He said the new government's priorities would be the drafting of
a new constitution and development of a ``coherent strategy'' for
transition to a free-market economy.
   The parliament has 18 months to draw up the new constitution.
Elections are to be held within a year of its adoption.
   Some Western diplomats and other observers have expressed
concern that a parliament dominated by the Front could write a
constitution enshrining itself in power.
   Iliescu said his challengers _ Radu Campeanu of the National
Liberal Party and Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party _ lost
because they ``misunderstood the character of the revolution and
slid to the extreme right.''
   The opposition leaders' platforms differed from that of the
Front mainly in their call for a quicker transition to a market
economy.
   The vocal student-led protesters failed to win support from
rural and working class people. A near final tally of the vote
released Wednesday showed Iliescu with 85 percent of the votes for
president and his National Salvation Front with 67 percent of the
votes for the two-chamber parliament.

<HEAD>Republican Study Says Raising Taxes on Rich Would Hurt Average
Taxpayer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raising taxes on the richest Americans would
mean less take-home pay for the average taxpayer, a study prepared
for House Republicans concluded today.
   The House Republican Research Committee released the study as
part of a campaign to have President Bush stick by his pledge to
oppose any tax increase for deficit reduction.
   The Institute for Policy Innovation, a Lewisville, Texas,
research organization, analyzed a proposal to raise to 33 percent
the 28 percent top income-tax rate on the 600,000 wealthiest
Americans. Such an increase is advocated by many Democrats in
Congress.
   ``Those who hope to redistribute income to the poor by
increasing tax progressivity may actually harm intended
beneficiaries,'' the institute concluded. ``In this case, average
taxpayers end up worse off by over $500.
   ``In a complex, integrated economy any narrowly directed tax
rapidly becomes a tax on everyone,'' the study said.
   According to the analysis, raising the top tax rate on the very
rich would slow the economy, reduce investment and, over the next
decade, cost 377,000 jobs that otherwise would be created. That
would result in a reduction of after-tax income that, if spread
among all taxpayers at all levels, would cost $534 a year on the
average.
   The study said that by the year 2000, the tax increase would
result in a $435-a-year loss of after-tax income for a taxpayer
making between $30,000 and $45,000, and $123,864 for one making
over $750,000.

   President Bush today conceded his summit next
week with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev would produce few signed
agreements but promised to seek significnt progress on arms talks
and other superpower disputes.
   ``I don't want to have two ships pass in the night,'' Bush said.
``We've got a lot to talk about.''
   Bush said the lack of formal agreements should not be viewed as
a sign the summit will be a failure.
   ``I don't want to overpromise but I don't want to act like I
think it's some kind of dance,'' Bush told a White House news
conference. ``What we're going to talk about is really
substantive.''
   Specifically, he listed the tension in Lithuania and other
secessionist Baltic states, German unification, chemical and
nuclear weapons and conventional troop levels in Europe as items on
the agenda.
   Bush said he could not offer preferential trade treatment to the
Soviets yet because the Soviet legislature has not passed suitable
emigration laws guaranteeing Soviet Jews and other ethnic groups
that they can leave the country.
   ``I think there is a political climate in this country that
would make it extremely difficult to grant'' the trade benefits to
the Soviets, Bush said.
   And the president said he had no problems with the agreement on
reductions in long-range nuclear weapons Secretary of State James
A. Baker III negotiated with Moscow. Bush and Gorbachev are to sign
off on the broad details of that deal but the specifics still are
being negotiated.
   ``There is no light between us on that at all,'' Bush said when
asked if he thought Baker gave away too much. ``It is a sound
position.''
   Baker on Wednesday defended the arms control declaration against
critics, mostly conservative columnists, who have accused him of
giving too much ground in his negotiations last week in Moscow.
   ``There is very strong support for this agreement among the
military leadership of the United States ... support for it as a
good agreement that is very much in the national security interests
of the United States,'' Baker said at a news conference.
   ``And it would appear to me at least that most of the criticism
is coming from those who in the past, from time to time, have
simply rejected the concept of arms control generally,'' he told
reporters at the White House.
   The agreement is not in the form of a treaty. That could take
months, maybe years, of negotiations to conclude. So far, the two
sides have been at it for eight years already, and the draft text
runs more than 400 pages.
   Rather, Bush and Gorbachev will declare their intention to
reduce long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to
35 percent, overall _ a promise that treaty technicians would be
under instruction to fulfill.
   That's less than the 50 percent cutback advertised by the Reagan
administration when the talks began in Geneva in 1982. But the 50
percent figure still holds for reductions in the Soviets'
land-based SS-18 missiles _ their most powerful nuclear weapon.
   The Pentagon, on the other hand, will have far more elbow room
to hold on to their favorite nuclear weapons.
   Some of the criticism is based on the fact that Baker, without
public announcement, agreed in Moscow that the Soviets could do
some limited testing of an updated version of the powerful rockets.
   He also accepted the Soviet cutoff of 375 miles for air-launched
cruise missiles that would be excluded. Those with ranges above 375
miles would be subject to restrictions.
   Initially, the United States wanted no restrictions up to 625
miles.
   But on most points, Baker prevailed _ including the right to
count nuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard 150 B52 bombers as
numbering l0 apiece even though up to 20 could be packed aboard.
That means 50 percent of the weapons would not be counted.
   Also, there would be no verification of the number of cruises
carried aboard ships. That is an area in which the United States
has a commanding edge.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators, meeting at the State Department in
the days before the summit, might manage to settle differences over
some other strategic weapons, and add them to the declaration Bush
and Gorbachev will announce.
   But the script could be deprived of a new U.S.-Soviet trade
agreement because the Soviet parliament has not concluded passage
of a new right-to-travel law.
   The Soviets had been expected to pass the law May 31, as the
summit opened, but Baker said the action ``has been postponed
somewhat.''
   The law would remove virtually all obstacles to emigration of
Jews and other Soviet citizens who would like to live in another
country.
   Even without it, some 20,000 exit permits are to be granted this
month. But Jewish groups and others adamant about the right to
travel wanted the law on the books as soon as possible.
   The new law and a trade agreement were the two preconditions set
by the President for recommending to Congress a one-year waiver of
high tariffs against Soviet goods entering the United States.
   As for the offstage threat that Lithuania could upset the summit
script, Baker said the Bush administration was determined to
prevent that from happening.
   ``There is too much at stake,'' he said, ``... to dismiss
cavalierly the potential for progress'' in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Bush and Baker are under pressure to treat Gorbachev coolly
unless the Soviet leader drops his demand that independence
resolutions in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia be suspended.

<HEAD>Scientists Report Gain in Superconductor Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Researchers say they have increased the amount of
current that bulk samples of ``high temperature'' superconducting
materials can carry, a possible step toward making them practical.
   In one experiment, a sample of experimental superconductor
carried 10 times the amount of current that standard
superconducting materials do, the University of Houston said in a
statement.
   Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without
resistance. The materials discovered so far must be made very cold
to work. Recently, ``high-temperature'' superconductors have been
created that operate at higher temperatures than standard
superconductors, which are widely used in medical technology and
other areas.
   One problem with high-temperature materials is that the amount
of electrical current they can carry has been limited.
   But University of Houston researchers say that by using special
techniques to prepare a sample of superconducting material, they
produced high current-carrying capacity at both very low and
relatively high temperatures.
   For example, at about minus 451 degrees Fahrenheit, the sample
carried 20 million amperes per square centimeter of cross-section
when exposed to a magnetic field of a certain strength, and 8
million amps per square centimeter in a field 10 times as strong.
   That performance is more than 10 times what conventional
superconductors can do, the university said.
   At minus 321 degrees, the sample carried 1 million amps per
square centimeter in the absence of a magnetic field, and 200,000
amps per square centimeter when exposed to a magnetic field.
   The research team included C.W. Paul Chu, Pei-Herng Hor and
others at the Texas Center for Superconductivity at the university.
Their work is scheduled to be published in the journal Modern
Physics Letters.
   Malcolm Beasley, a professor of applied physics at Stanford
University, called the work ``a very useful step toward practical
use.''

   Q: Well, are you made particularly uncomfortable, sir, by the
fact that our support for the non-communist resistance has the
effect, at least, since they are fighting alongside the Khmer
Rouge, of helping the notorious Khmer Rouge?
   A: To the degree it has any effect to help them, yes, I am
uncomfortable about it. But when we have this kind of compromise
that has been worked out at _ it _ at this juncture, I think we're
on the right track. But there's a discomfort level for it because
of the brutality of the Khmer Rouge. And if anybody even perceives
that we're trying to help those people, why, then it does cause
discomfort. But I think we're on the right track. We are reviewing
the whole policy now. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, this morning the Soviet government,
specifically the prime minister, rejected Lithuania's latest
compromise offer to get talks going. Are you disappointed that
Moscow seems to be persisting in this hard line, and what do you
plan to tell President Gorbachev when you _ about Lithuania?
   A: Michael, I was encouraged when the prime minister, having
made her swing of the United States and other countries _
Prunskiene _ went to Moscow. I was encouraged when she was received
by Mr. Gorbachev. I can't tell you I am encouraged about where it
stands right now. I have told you _ told the American people that
this Lithuanian situation, and indeed, the situation regarding the
Baltics, whose incorporation into the Soviet Union we have never
recognized, does cause certain tensions. And Jim Baker had a very
frank discussion with President Gorbachev about that. He
understands from Jim Baker, and frankly, from me directly, how we
feel about this. so I wish I could give you a more optimistic
assessment because _ but the answer, the only answer to this
question lies in dialogue between the affected parties. And I was
encouraged when Prunskiene met with Mr. Gorbachev, but I have no
reason now to report to the American people further encouragement.
   Q: If I could follow up, about a month or so ago you said that
you thought Mr. Gorbachev was showing willingness to compromise and
the Lithuanians only showing some willingness to compromise. Is
that still your assessment, or have you reviewed the balance on
that?
   A: Well, I _ you're presenting me with some _ some semantic
difference that I did not intend to make. But I _ I'm not here to
assess blame. What I'm here to do is to assess the _ you know, to
try to encourage a dialogue on this important question. It is
extraordinarily difficult for both sides. And I think President
Gorbachev is concerned not just about the Baltics but about other
republics, and I think the Lithuanians, understandably are
concerned about their freedom and their right to
self-determination, although the Soviet Union still says
self-determination is proper. They've got a difference on
referendum, they have other differences. John?
   Q: Mr. President, critics of this decision on China believe it
is based too heavily on a blind faith that you have in those
leaders based on your experience as envoy over there. What message
does this send to the younger generation of Chinese leaders who are
going to come along and replace those in power now?
   A: It says that economic contacts are the best way to keep the
economic reforms going forward. It says that the more economic
contacts we have with China, the more they are going to see the
fruits of free market economies. I have told you that the students
in China, according to our ambassador, want to see this MFN
continue. And so, it should send no message other than that
isolation is bad and economic involvement is good. And economic _
the whole fact that we've had economic involvement, I think has
moved China more towards reform than if we hadn't had it. And so, I
want to see it continue and that is the message to the people
because it has _ some will interpret the way you've said, and I
will say it has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with
that at all. We have certain sanctions in place, they remain in
place. China has got an emigration policy going that qualifies, and
you have interests of _ Taiwan says keep it going, Hong Kong says
keep it going. Three editorials in this country _ well maybe, many,
many, more I think _ who were upset with the fact that I opted for
executive action instead of legislation, all support continuation
of MFN. And those people who were on my case, if you will, about
the decision I took, which I still think was the correct decision,
are now saying ``Continue MFN.'' So _

   Two union members have been sentenced to jail for
attacks on buses during the strike against Greyhound Bus Co.
   Michael Holden, vice president of Local 1205 of Amalgamated
Transit Union in Boston, and Richard Cunningham were sentenced
after a one-day trial in Boston Municipal Court Wednesday. Holden
was given a 30-day sentence on a disorderly conduct charge,
Cunningham six months for malicious destruction.
   The two were released on their own recognizance pending an
appeal June 7, a court spokesman said this morning.
   Holden and Cunningham are the first Greyhound employees
sentenced to jail in an incident related to the strike, the company
said. Greyhound has several other cases pending in various states.
   Holden stopped a Greyhound bus in traffic May 6 and slashed a
tire, according to a witness quoted in court records.
   Cunningham was charged with smashing a windshield of a bus at
the downtown Greyhound terminal in Boston on April 27.
   Earlier, a Greyhound union member in Cleveland was given a
suspended sentence for strike-related violence.
   The strike against Greyhound began March 2 when most of the
company's union drivers walked off the job. Incidents of violence
have occurred around the country as Greyhound continued to operate.

   Q: Are you satisfied that these students who now say that they
favor the policy, aren't doing that under some duress since the
crackdown by the regime in Beijing?
   A: No, because I think you wouldn't see _ you wouldn't see all
these other interests out there if it was simply that. Maybe
there's some pressure on them _ I don't know. But that's not what
our ambassador's telling me. He had to _
   Q: Your favorite subject _ taxes. Some of the polls are _
   A: Texas?
   Q: Taxes. (Laughter.)
   A: Is that what you mean? I thought you were talking about the
Texas economic summit.
   Q: Several polls, including one broadcast last night, are
showing that most Americans think that there will be taxes, and
about half _ in fact, they think you'll go along with taxes _ and
about half say they're willing to go along with taxes themselves if
the case can be proven that taxes are needed. Does this give you
more leeway as you make your decision?
   A: Look, I have stated right here at this podium that I'm not
going to go into the details of these _ what might be discussed up
there. I've said that there's no preconditions. I'm satisfied with
the way the process is going. Indeed, I should give credit to Mr.
Gephardt for the conduct of these initial meetings. Our people _
Dick Darman, Nick Brady, John Sununu up there _ all working in good
faith. And I've seen those surveys, but it is way too early to
start talking about remedies here. I want to let that process go
forward and then, when I get agreement, I will go out and say to
the American people, ``Here's what we recommend.'' And I'm not
going to prejudge it.
   Q: Can I just follow that up _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ on the time frame? You're going to host the economic summit
in Texas in early July. By that time, do you think you must have
gone to the American people to suggest remedies? Do you not want to
go into the economic summit and say to the _ to your fellow world
leaders _ ``Well, we really haven't resolved this, and I don't have
anything to tell you''?
   A: I think the economic, the G-7 leaders, know of my
determination to do something about the budget deficit. So, I don't
_ I'm not _ I don't have the time frame linked into progress or
lack of progress by the time of the summit meets in Houston.
   Q: Some of the Democrats up on the Hill _
   A: Yes?
   Q: _ Mr. President, say that you're ducking the tough issue by
saying what you just said, that you're not going to tell the
American people _
   A: Yes, I've heard that criticism.
   Q: They want you to outline the problem and explain to the
American people that it's going to take sacrifice. Are you ready to
do at least that?
   A: I'm going to outline the problem when we get agreement so we
can go forward with the solution. If I outlined the problem now,
I'd go rely on some of the fact that the Congress appropriates all
the money and raises all the revenues. That's their obligation. And
I'm not one to dwell on surveys recently, but I will point out that
people understand that the Congress bears a greater responsibility
for this. But I'm not trying to assign blame; that's why I'm not
doing it right now _ (laughter). That's why I'm not doing it.
That's why I'm saying we're going to sit and talk. Because if I go
out now and say what I think without dealing in, you know, keeping
in mind the need to get some progress, I might say something like I
just said, and I don't want to do that. (Laughter.)
   Q: But they're going to come back at you today up on the Hill,
and they're going to say, ``See, he's not showing leadership.''
What's your answer to that?
   A: My answer is I am. We've gotten these people together. I've
said there's no preconditions. Let's talk. And I think it's making
progress. You're going to always have some people on the fringes
sniping at you. That goes with this territory. But I think we're on
the right track, and we'll try to do our best to get a deal. Yes,
Charles?
   Q: Mr. President, come back to the earlier question about MFN
for the Soviet Union. While you point out that there's no
emigration law there as yet, the Soviets are moving towards that,
is there any additional _ and some people would suggest Lithuania
is an additional condition _ under which you do not want to extend
MFN at this point to the Soviet Union?

<HEAD>State Police Officer Under Fire for Sending `Sex Quiz' to Boss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state police officer who complained
about a ``sex quiz'' handed out at a training session is under
investigation for sending a copy to alert his boss, his attorney
said.
   ``To make a complaint about sexually offensive material, and
then be charged with distributing sexually offensive material for
complaining, it just defies description,'' attorney Alan Legum said
Wednesday.
   ``We think this has a tremendous chilling effect, especially on
minorities,'' said Legum, who represents Department of Natural
Resources Officer Michael G. Sewell.
   Sewell, president of the Black Officers' Association, said in
his May 10 letter to DNR Secretary Torrey C. Brown that the quiz he
called sexist reminded him of a file of racist jokes that sparked a
1985 lawsuit against the department.
   Sewell enclosed a copy of the ``Official Game Warden Sex Quiz,''
which had been distributed, apparently as a joke, by an officer
conducting a training program May 8 in Caroline County, Legum said.
   ``If this test is an indication of his feelings for females,
then what is it for blacks? And how does another black female even
stand a chance to get hired?'' Sewell wrote.
   Monday a formal complaint was filed against Sewell for mailing
the material to Brown.
   In a statement Wednesday, Brown said the agency launched an
investigation the day the quiz was distributed because it was
``totally inappropriate'' and offensive. Brown said ``appropriate
actions'' were being taken against those involved, declining to be
specific because personnel matters are confidential.
   Without naming Sewell, Brown said that an officer wrote to
superiors about the incident and sent copies of the letter with the
sex quiz attached to numerous persons outside the agency.
   ``This conduct too has been determined to merit appropriate
action,'' Brown said.
   Legum said Sewell was that officer and the only complaint so far
brought against him was for mailing the quiz to Brown. Sewell has
said he did send other copies outside the agency.
   Departmental charges carry punishments ranging from verbal
reprimand to dismissal.
   The one-page quiz featured 24 true-false statements playing off
sexual puns, according to a copy provided to The (Annapolis)
Capital by Annapolis Alderman Carl O. Snowden.
   In his letter to Brown, Sewell compared the jokes to a file of
racist and ethnic jokes found in the DNR police radio room. The
discovery prompted a lawsuit and $26,000 settlement.
   In 1986, the agency agreed to punish the distribution of similar
material as part of a settlement to a bias suit brought by the
department's black officers.
   When the second suit was filed, the DNR's 203-member police
force had four black officers. The force, which patrols state lands
and waterways, now has 14 black officers and 14 women officers
among a staff of 226.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Soviet Union?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: Well, I think there's a political climate in this country
that would make it extraordinarily difficult to grant it, but that
is not a bridge we're having to cross at this juncture because the
_ because the legislation is not in place in the Soviet Union.
   Q: But it is a bridge that you're going to have to cross when
that legislation is in place, and it seems _
   A: Well, but let's hope there's some progress on the Lithuanian
question, because I think many feel there's a direct linkage there.
And I must say, it concerns me. Yes?
   Q: In what way, sir?
   A: Hmm?
   Q: In what way?
   A: Because I want to see these negotiations start, and I want to
see this emigration law pass, and there's a lot of things going on
that are going to affect the whole climate of the economic aspects
of this summit.
   Q: I'd like to ask you about the climate of the summit. The
Soviets have slowed down the negotiations on conventional arms
control. You are not going to be signing a START treaty, which we'd
been led to believe was going to be the centerpiece of this summit.
It looks like there won't be any kind of trade treaty signed. Has
the summit changed from one of consolidating gains and moving ahead
to just trying to get the relationship back on track?
   A: I wouldn't phrase it exactly that way. You may recall that I
mentioned in here, in answer to the question ``Who's the enemy?'' _
instability, unpredictability. And it would seem to me that I would
repeat that, and I don't want to have two ships pass in the night,
the Soviet Union and the United States. And we've got a lot to talk
about. I don't want to, by answering the question this way,
indicate I don't think there will be significant progress on START.
I hope we can move things forward on CFE. Indeed, I was heartened
by what Shevardnadze and Genscher talked about yesterday. That was
somewhat encouraging.
   Chemical weapons, I hope I've expressed with great enthusiasm
and passion my desire to do something about chemical weapons. And
it looks to me like we are very, very close there. So we've got a
lot of things that I think will be seen properly as progress, but
there's enormous problems that just need to be talked about where I
can't say there will be an answer. And I would refer you to the
highly complex question of German unification, of forces that _
where forces will be deployed and whose forces will be deployed
after German unification. We got questions on borders. We've got a
lot of things to discuss that might not result in a signed
agreement.
   Q: Considering all those things, and especially the Lithuanian
situation, is your personal relationship with Mr. Gorbachev changed
coming into this summit?
   A: Well, I'll have to wait and see what he says when he gets
here. But, I feel that the man has got some enormous problems; he's
made some enormous progress. I think he knows _ from talking to Jim
Baker after he got back _ that we're not trying to undermine him or
make life complicated for him. But, we have certain _ certain
differences with the Soviet Union which we're _ I'll be perfectly
prepared to talk about. So, you know, it's a good question and we
were talking about it before coming in here. Because I don't want
to over-promise, but I don't want to act like I think it's just,
you know, some kind of a dance out there of _ on this meeting.
Because what we're going to talk about is really substantive. And I
think the part where we can sit and talk at Camp David there _ I'm
glad the Soviets have agreed to that _ because I think it's in that
kind of a session that I can _ after which I'll probably be better
_ better able to answer the question you asked about the
relationship itself. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, the conflict in Israel _ Mr. President, the
conflict in Israel between the Israelis and the Palestinians seems
to become increasingly violent.
   A: Yes.
   Q: Do you think the Israelis at this point are acting
appropriately and responsibly?

<HEAD>Anti-Terrorist Unit Comprised Mostly of Secret Police Agents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of East Germany's anti-terrorist unit is
made up of former members of the ousted Communist regime's feared
secret police, a government spokesman said today.
   The Interior Ministry official said 109 of the 149 members of
the special police unit worked previously as agents for the
domestic security network known as the Stasi, which has been
disbanded.
   The remaining 40 members came from the East German army, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The anti-terrorist unit was formed in December under the
reform-oriented caretaker government led by Premier Hans Modrow,
who ran East Germany after the Communist hard-liners were ousted in
November.
   Modrow's retooled Communist Party was voted out of power in the
nation's first democratic elections on March 18.
   But the spokesman said none of the former secret police working
in the special unit took part in the violent crackdown on
demonstrations on Oct. 7-8 that helped fuel the peaceful revolt
that ousted the former regime.
   East Germany is embroiled in debate over what to do with the
80,000 people who worked for the Stasi, which used a network of
surveillance and informants to enforce the rule of the former
Communist government.
   Some people have demanded investigations of former Stasi members
and the estimated 100,000 informants and those who worked with
them. Others argue the network was so vast that the investigation
would amount to a witchhunt.
   But many former bureaucrats, intelligence specialists and law
enforcement officials are considered by some people to be too
valuable and experienced to be removed from their jobs.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and his Cabinet on Wednesday
gave a vote of confidence to the embattled interior minister,
Peter-Michael Diestel, who is reluctant to remove former Stasi
members from the domestic security network.
   Many lawmakers, including those from Diestel's own
archconservative German Social Union, have demanded the interior
minister's resignation because of his propensity for hiring or
retaining security specialists from the old regime.
   Opposition lawmakers say Diestel has more than 2,000 former
members of the Stasi on the payroll.
   Diestel on Wednesday announced the formation of a new committee
to oversee the dissolution of the Stasi and to decide what to do
with files kept on an estimated 6 million East Germans.
   The committee includes prominent East German authors Stefan Heym
and Walter Janka, church leaders, and members of a former citizens
committee set up by the Modrow government.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu apologized today and
Emperor Akihito expressed ``deepest regret'' for Japan's harsh
colonial rule over Korea, in statements designed to put the
nations' bitter past behind them.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo met Kaifu and the emperor on
the first day of a three-day state visit that is a carefully
scripted attempt by the two countries to move ahead as partners in
spreading peace and prosperity.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its stifling 1910-1945 rule of Korea.
   At a state banquet, Roh said the two countries ``should strive
to remove the dark shadow of history,'' but Koreans had hoped for a
more direct apology from the emperor.
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police today. They shouted slogans that Roh's
trip was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Feelings still run high in South Korea over Japanese colonial
abuses. Koreans had to study Japanese in school and were taught to
worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted into the
Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of thousands
died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan and the history is skimmed over
in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Security was heavy for Roh's visit. About 20,000 police were
mobilized in Tokyo to prevent attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists who threatened to disrupt the event. Protest rallies
were held in Tokyo.
   After a 21-gun salute, Roh and his wife were received at Tokyo's
official guest house by Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko, Kaifu and
dozens of other Japanese officials and members of the imperial
family.
   Later, Kaifu delivered what Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said was a stronger apology than any by previous prime
ministers and a more direct acknowledgement of Japan's
responsibility.
   Kaifu told Roh that Japan and South Korea must ``clearly and
honestly articulate the realities of events that have so
regrettably marred our past relations,'' Watanabe told reporters.
   Kaifu expressed his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies for
the fact that there was a period in our history in which Japan's
action inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of
the Korean Peninsula,'' Watanabe said.
   He quoted Roh as saying Kaifu's statement ``reflects a correct
recognition of history.''
   Watanabe said the Seoul government had been informed in advance
of what the prime minister and the emperor would say.
   At the state banquet, attention was focused on the ``okotoba,''
the emperor's speech. The Seoul government had asked that Akihito
apologize for Japan's actions in Korea and wanted him to state
Japan's responsibility.
   When Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, made the only previous
visit by a South Korean president in 1984, the late Emperor
Hirohito left the Koreans dissatisfied with a vague statement
expressing regret about the ``unfortunate past'' between the two
countries.
   Akihito never used the word apology in his brief speech _
government officials will use that word in later meetings _ but he
made a point of quoting Hirohito's words in 1984, and he said more.
   Hirohito had said: ``It is indeed regrettable that there was an
unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and I
believe it should not be repeated again.''
   Akihito went on to say, ``I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about
by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   He also praised South Korea's economic advancement and said he
hoped the people of the two countries would together ``play
important roles for the peace and prosperity of the world.''
   In Seoul, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
Akihito's speech. Vice Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   In his reply, Roh said the ``dark period'' in relations between
the neighboring countries had been short, and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   The 21st century will be the Asia-Pacific Age, he said, and
relations between the two countries would make a difference to the
wider world.
   ``For our nations ought to combine our efforts to take a leading
role in promoting peace and prosperity through the Asia-Pacific
region, an area which will become the cradle of a new civilization
harmoniously blending things East and West,'' he said.

   Marla Maples touted her new jeans ads in her
first press conference since emerging as the alleged other woman in
the breakup of Donald Trump's marriage. But Trump's wife, Ivana,
stole the spotlight.
   Two process servers hired by Mrs. Trump slapped Maples with
legal papers Wednesday requiring the actress to tell about her
friendship with Trump. An attorney for Mrs. Trump, Michael Kennedy,
said he wants Maples to reveal how long she was seeing Trump
without Mrs. Trump's knowledge.
   Maples tried to avoid questions about the Trumps at the press
conference to announce her new $600,000 contract as a spokeswoman
for No Excuses jeans. The ad campaign kicks off in August.
   In 1987, No Excuses capitalized on the fleeting fame of another
alleged ``other woman,'' Donna Rice, whose reported liaison with
Gary Hart resulted in his withdrawal from the 1988 presidential
race.
   Anticipating the question before it was asked, the 26-year-old
Maples refused to discuss her relationship with Trump. ``I don't
want to comment on that. He's still working on his own personal
situation.''
   The Trumps, neither of whom has filed for divorce, are haggling
over the terms of a $25 million post-nuptial agreement. The master
deal maker says the agreement is ironclad. Mrs. Trump disagrees and
wants more.
   Maples was eating lunch after her appearance when the process
servers approached her table and slapped the papers down in front
of her. ``You are hereby served,'' she was told.
   Maples let the papers fall and walked out, so it was not clear
whether she was properly served.
   Though she would not take questions from reporters about Trump,
Maples did talk about being the subject of months of sensational
headlines.
   ``I haven't been to my apartment but for one day, so I'm sort of
borrowing friends' clothes. I'd love to go to the grocery store and
do some shopping. I feel everything I do is getting reported.''
   Much of that, she realizes, is the result of her self-imposed
exile.
   She said she chose to go into hiding ``because I didn't want to
get involved. ... I wanted to try and pull attention away from me.''
   She added, ``Of course, we all know it didn't happen that way.''
   Photographers dogged her. The National Enquirer offered her $1
million to tell all; when that failed, they offered money to anyone
in her hometown of Dalton, Ga., for ``Marla stories.'' The Star
went one up on the Enquirer, offering her even more money. Playboy
made its pitch, too.
   She smiled sweetly Wednesday for hungry photographers who barked
orders at her _ ``Marla, this way. Marla, turn around. Marla, right
here'' _ all the while answering reporters' questions, no matter
how outrageous.
   ``Did Donald ever moan, `Oh, Ivana,''' someone shouted. ``That's
not a fair question,'' she replied, smile intact.

<HEAD>University Files First Legal Challenge of No-Obscenity Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university filed the first legal challenge of
a no-obscenity pledge federal arts grant recipients must sign to
receive their money.
   The New School for Social Research argued in a federal lawsuit
filed Wednesday that the pledge required by the National Endowment
of the Arts is unconstitutional.
   The school is up for a $45,000 grant to build a sculpture garden
at its Manhattan campus.
   It is the first time the pledge, sent to more than 4,000 grant
recipients, has been challenged in court, said attorney Floyd
Abrams, a First Amendment specialist who represents the school.
   Besides being unconstitutionally vague, the pledge goes beyond
the U.S. Supreme Court's definition of obscenity, school President
Jonathan F. Fanton said.
   Last month, theater producer Joseph Papp turned down a $50,000
federal grant rather than sign the pledge.
   Fanton said the school learned in March that its grant
application to redesign a Greenwich Village courtyard into a
sculpture garden had been approved, but it was unwilling to sign
the pledge, he said.
   ``We came very quickly to the conclusion that we really could
not accept a grant that impinged on freedom of expression,'' the
president said.
   The arts endowment on Wednesday declined to comment on the
lawsuit until it had a chance to study it.
   In a letter to Fanton earlier this month, NEA Chairman John
Frohnmayer wrote, ``We too have severe questions about the
constitutionality of this law but that does not mean we can choose
to ignore it.''
   Two controversial photographic exhibits supported by national
endowment money prompted Congress last year to put strings on
government aid to the arts, forbidding the financing of works that
might be considered obscene. The restrictions are to last one year.
   The legislation bars subsidies for art depicting
``sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of
children, or individuals engaged in sex acts, which when taken as a
whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.''
   The arts endowment requires grant winners to pledge not to use
the federal funds for projects that may be considered obscene
according to the legislation's definition of obscenity.
   In a 1973 decision, the Supreme Court said that in order to be
obscene, material must violate community standards, depict clearly
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value.
   Abrams argued that the endowment conditions go beyond that
definition by specifying categories.
   ``It is possible that Michelangelo's David could be considered
an example of homoerotic art,'' he said.
   In its lawsuit, the New School seeks a preliminary injunction
restraining the endowment and Frohnmayer from requiring it to sign
the pledge before receiving the grant. It also asks the court to
declare the requirement unconstitutional.
   A hearing date in U.S. District Court was scheduled for June 14.
   The New School was established in 1919 by intellectuals
concerned about limitations on academic freedom at traditional
universities. Today it includes, among other schools, the Graduate
Faculty of Political and Social Science, Parsons School of Design
and Mannes College of Music.

   A: Well, I have called on both sides for restraint. I've called
on the Israeli Forces to show constraint. I'm worried about it. I
am troubled about the loss of human life in this area. I am deeply
troubled about _ well _ totally human life, but I think
particularly of children in this kind of situation. And the answer
is to get these talks going. And I will do everything I can to _ to
get the talks for peace going. And so we're talking _ I was on the
phone yesterday, I think it was, with Mubarak. And we had very good
talks _ pre-Baghdad summit with Ben Ali here, who is _ represents a
friendly country. We're talking to a lot of people about how that
can go, but, yes, I am very troubled by this.
   Q: Well, Mr. President, is there anything that the United States
can do with its enormous clout with Israel, to push the Israelis to
be more open to these peace talks?
   A: Well, the problem we face right now is this, almost an
interregnum. I mean, there's no firm decision-making government in
place. So, we're in a bit of a hiatus because of that. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, yes. Do you think that the relations with
Mexico are going to be damaged now that Mexico is asking for the
extradition or the return of Dr. Alvarez Machain?
   A: No.
   Q: And I would like to follow up.
   A: The answer is ``no.'' Go ahead and follow up.
   Q: Yes. What can be done in that case? Are you going to return
him? Are you going to _
   A: Well, I'm not going to get into that because we have some
matters in the court on that question. But the reason I answered _
and I wasn't being flip about it _ that relationship is too
important that no incident is going to disrupt it. The respect I
feel for President Salinas is shared by the American people. The
determination to keep this relationship that has already moved
forward, continuing to move forward, is shared by the American
people. Today, I'll be meeting with some parliamentarians, a group
incidentally that I belonged to 20 _ let's see, how many? _ 22-some
years ago _ and I'm sure some of these questions will come up. But,
I'm not going to go into anything that might conflict with the
legal problem. But, I did _ be sure that the President of Mexico
knows that we did not grab that doctor and Americans did not do
that. I think that has helped somewhat. Yes, right here.
   Q: Mr. President, your administration has raised the likelihood
of a veto of Senate legislation that bans several types of
semiautomatic weapons. And we see that you're supporting
legislation _ Republican legislation _ that doesn't even include
your own proposal which would have restricted the ammunition
capacity of these weapons. Why is it that you insist on having a
different standard for these domestically produced weapons than you
do for imports?
   A: Look, Rita, I have not changed my position on clips
_-ammunition clips. I read in the paper somewhere that we had
changed it and backed off of that position. That isn't true. I sent
a crime bill, however, to the Congress and I'd like to it enacted _
a law enforcement bill. Congress knows of the difficulties. You saw
it passed yesterday by one vote, this ban. I am not supporting that
and I wish the Congress wouldn't keep adding matters of this
nature. Let's get a good, strong, anti-crime bill and then we can
have an open debate, again, on whatever they want to talk about.
But all I can do is perfect legislation by saying, ``Here is what I
can accept, and here is what I can't.'' And if they want to add
something on these clips, that's fine, it'd have my strong support.
The automatic weapon part does not have my strong support.

<HEAD>Fiji Orders Closure of Indian Embassy, Expels Diplomats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiji ordered the Indian Embassy closed and
expelled its diplomats because of India's support for this nation's
democratic opposition. India today called Fiji's government illegal
and discriminatory.
   Relations between India and the South Pacific nation of Fiji
have been strained since 1987 when Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, now army
chief, staged two coups that toppled the Indian-dominated elected
government of Timoci Bavadra.
   Rabuka claimed he was protecting the interests of indigenous
Fijians, who are now outnumbered by ethnic Indians.
   Fiji's order Wednesday followed New Delhi's announcement on May
10 that it would launch an international campaign against what it
called discrimination against Indians in Fiji. The Indian Embassy
closed its doors today and took down its flag before a noon
deadline.
   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday that India's
planned anti-Fiji campaign and a trade ban that has been imposed
since the coups were ``unfriendly and unwarranted acts.''
   It also accused the Indian Embassy of ``continued interference''
in its internal affairs but gave no specifics.
   The opposition coalition said in a statement that the closure
was part of a ``systematic attempt to humiliate the Fiji Indian
community and weaken its resolve to fight injustices that have been
perpetrated upon them.''
   In New Delhi, Indian Foreign Minister Kumar Gujral said India's
moral support for the pro-democracy group prompted the closure
order from the military-dominated government, which he called an
``illegal regime.''
   ``Racial discrimination is on the retreat even in South
Africa,'' Gujral told Parliament. ``It cannot survive in Fiji for
long.''
   Fiji has a population of 715,000 people. Indians, whose
ancestors were brought in by the British as indentured sugar
plantation laborers, slightly outnumber ethnic Melanesian Fijians.
   The former British colony, which achieved independence in 1970,
was expelled from the Commonwealth after it declared itself a
republic in 1987. India has long said it would oppose any move by
Fiji for re-entry because of what it describes as the government's
policy of discrimination.
   Fiji is composed of about 320 islands, most of them uninhabited.

   President Bush said today he is ``very
troubled'' by the escalating violence in Israel, and renewed his
call for restraint by all parties.
   ``I have called on both sides for restraint. I've called on the
Israeli forces to show restraint,'' Bush told a news conference at
the White House. He added, ``I'm worried about it. I`m troubled
about the loss of human life in this area ... particularly of
children in this kind of situation.''
   He did not elaborate further on the heavy use of gunfire by
Israeli soldiers against Palestinians living in the occupied
territories.
   He called for stepped-up movement on peace talks in the region.
   ``The answer is to get these talks going and I will do
everything I can to get the talks for peace going,'' Bush said when
asked whether the United States could exert pressure on Israel.
   He said U.S. officials are ``talking with a lot of people'' to
try to promote the peace process. ``But, yes, I'm very troubled by
it,'' he added.
   He said he had talked by phone about the matter on Wednesday
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Bush noted that progress is somewhat hampered because this is
``almost an interregnum'' period while waiting for Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to form a new government, which he is
expected to do in the next two weeks.
   ``There is no firm decision-making government in place,'' Bush
said.
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats lawmakers lambasted the
administration's Middle East policy. In particular, they criticized
the administration for a report that concludes the Palestine
Liberation Organization has lived up to its commitment to renounce
terrorism.
   The United States has said it would break off its dialogue with
the PLO if there were violations of that commitment.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., a strong supporter of Israel, called
the administration's report a ``pack of lies ... a sham and a
fraud.'' He added the Bush administration has the ``worst Middle
East policy'' he'd seen in 20 years.
   John Kelly, the assistant secretary of State for the Middle
East, defended the report. ``We clearly disagree ... that the
report is dishonest. It is not.''
   Kelly said he was not acting as an apologist for the PLO, but
contended there was ``no conclusive evidence to indicate PLO
violations of its commitments.''
   Israel has rejected the idea of United Nations observers in the
occupied territories to safeguard the Palestinian population.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to propose the observer
force to a Friday session of the 15-nation U.N. Security Council in
Geneva.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday the United
States is prepared to discuss the issue.
   Bush's statements came as Gaza Strip curfews remained in effect
in the wake of rioing that began Sunday when a lone Israeli gunman
shot and killed seven Arabs.
   Palestinians have requested U.N. observers to protect the 1.7
million Arabs in the occupied territories from the Israeli army.
Most of the 710 Palestinians killed in the 29-month-old uprising
have been slain by army gunfire.

   Airport, scarcely took notice of the spraying.
   ``I think people should accept it,'' said longtime resident Toni
Turner, a retired case processor for the state attorney's office.
``In a climate like this, you're going to have insects and bugs and
flies.''
   In California, however, aerial spraying against the Medfly has
angered residents and some scientists who are fed up with a $40
million chemical war they say isn't working.
   Florida's joint state-federal Medfly eradication effort is on a
considerably smaller scale, and opposition has been minimal to the
fifth such campaign in a decade.
   There are opponents, however, who say awareness of the dangers
of malathion to people and the environment is growing, and the
Sunshine State could learn something from California.
   ``In this day and age, when we have sprayed ourselves to death
... we really feel a chemical solution is abhorrent, it's
distasteful,'' said Bonnie Barnes-Kelley, president of the Friends
of Oleta River, a group concerned with environmental issues.
   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner ordered the aerial
spraying to protect the state's multibillion-dollar farm economy.
Nearly two dozen of the pests, which can destroy hundreds of
varieties of fruits and vegetables, have been trapped since the
first was found April 16.
   The eradication program consists of weekly spraying over 16
square miles, which was to end in May. But state officials recently
announced that two more applications in a slightly expanded area
would be needed after a fly was found north of the core treatment
area.
   The spraying will be followed by the release of millions of
sterile male flies to break the breeding cycle.
   State officials insist the program is both safe and effective.
   ``I can assure you this: If we felt there was any hazard to the
population, we wouldn't be doing what we're doing,'' said Richard
Clark, director of the state's Medfly Eradication Project.
   Clark said spraying first was necessary while labs produced
enough quality sterile flies, which takes about a month. The
availability of large quantities of radiated flies on short notice
has been a source of concern in Florida and California.
   Because of frequent fly trappings in the past decade and the
public's increasing concern about malathion, Clark said more effort
and thought will go into keeping the laboratories prepared.
   Clark said studies in California have shown no adverse health
effects from the spraying. Furthermore, Florida has reduced the
average number of pesticide applications needed by half since 1985,
when sterile flies were introduced in the program, he said. Before
then, it took eight or nine treatments.
   Julia Morton, an economic botanist at the University of Miami,
recalls a massive spraying undertaken in 1956 to battle one of the
state's worst Medfly outbreaks, and she is convinced that malathion
is not harmful.
   ``It is not only acceptable,'' she said, ``but obligatory.''
   The public in South Florida has cooperated with agriculture
officials, unlike in California, Morton said. ``The people in
California should have checked their facts before they started
screaming about malathion.''
   Barnes-Kelley and the Washington-based National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides don't believe that spraying
malathion is harmless.
   ``It's a nervous-system poison, and it's not something to be
taken lightly,'' said Catherine Karr, staff toxicologist for the
coalition.
   ``I think what we're really concerned about is they're telling
us it's a very low risk. We don't buy that,'' Barnes-Kelley said.
   Opponents are worried that an insecticide that can ruin the
paint on cars if not rinsed off promptly and can harm small animals
can also hurt humans. But Floridians have not expressed widespread
opposition to the Medfly project, apparently because it has
affected relatively few people compared with California.
   In Southern California, aerial assaults, which the state
recently announced would continue in San Bernardino and Riverside
because of new fly finds, remain highly controversial. More than
500 square miles have been treated since last summer, with mixed
success.
   Several California cities, in efforts to seek a temporary
injunction to stop the spraying, have raised concerns over
environmental damage and threats to endangered and threatened
species. In Riverside County, the state agreed to stop aerial
spraying in areas where the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat
lives, although ground spraying was allowed.
   The area being affected in South Florida _ parts of Miami
Springs, Hialeah, Virginia Gardens and unincorporated Dade County _
is mostly residential with commercial corridors.
   Barnes-Kelley said various environmental groups in South Florida
have discussed anti-malathion strategies, but no legal action has
been planned. Interest in the issue is limited because only a
relatively small area of Dade County is affected, she said.
   Malathion is a general insecticide that also kills other
insects, such as honeybees and butterflies, said Tom Pliske, an
entomologist at Florida International University in Miami.
   Morton contends the poison-laced bait is strictly for Medflies
and does not wipe out other insects. It also disappears quickly and
has no cumulative effect, she said.
   Besides, she noted, Florida already sprays to control mosquitoes.
   Florida, in fact, dispenses more than 60,000 gallons of
malathion annually for controlling mosquitoes. The concentration is
also higher, slightly more than 3 ounces per acre, for mosquitoes
compared with 2.4 ounces per acre diluted with protein bait for
Medflies. California also sprays year-round for mosquitoes in a
program that has not been opposed by environmental activists.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: strong support.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: So, Mr. President, are we going to see then, your
administration and your people on the Hill pushing to get that
provision back in a law?
   A: Consider this a strong pitch for it right now. Right here on
the end.
   Q: Mr. President, what happened to your promise to balance the
budget without raising taxes? Are we going to make it?
   A: Are we going to make the promise? (Light laughter.) Things
are complicated out there on this subject and we are trying very
hard to get a budget agreement and that's the way it is, and we'll
see how we go. And I've reported, I think that we've started off
now in a bipartisan nature doing a good job. I wish we could
control the spending side better. We refer you once again _ I don't
want to ruin the last minute getting Nicaragua-Panama passed, but I
sent it up there at $800 million and it's now $2-plus billion. But
we'll keep plugging away and I'd like everybody to do it exactly
the way I proposed. I am now enough of a realist to realize that it
might not be done exactly that _ now here's my problem. I have a
10:00 meeting with the leader of Haiti and we've got some problems
there that we are helping _ trying to help to resolve, so I can
take two more. One, two _
   Q: Follow on that question _
   Q: All right, yes, Mr. President, I'd like to ask about the news
report coming out of _ in the aftermath of the Moscow meetings
between _ with Secretary Baker, that you were not as pleased with
the outcome of those talks, especially pertaining to START, as
Secretary Baker was.
   A: There is no light between us on that at all. The
administration has a united _ unified position. It is a sound
position. There's no point just before you sit down to say, ``They
caved. They gave more than we did.'' But I am very satisfied with
what _ where we stand. All I want to do is be sure we can move
forward and get _ get these deals finalized, and we may not be able
to do that. But it doesn't help for me to go out and say who gave
the most, who knuckled under, who took the most heat, too much
pressure. I support what Jim Baker reported to me was where we
stand at this juncture in negotiation. I'll tell you what troubles
me is that we're not _ somebody asked the question here _ we're not
further along on conventional forces. But the strategic arms talks
are going very well. We still haven't got a firm deal, as you know.
   But to get back to your _ (with a chuckle) _ to get back to your
question, there isn't any daylight between the White House and the
State Department or the arms control community or Defense. The
proposals that Jim Baker is talking about have the strong support
of the Joint Chiefs and of the secretary of Defense. So this is
very encouraging that the administration is united. Now we're going
to have some criticism. Any time you make a deal you have
editiorials out there telling you exactly how it should be done.
But I am confident that we're on the right track. Follow up, and
then we go over for one more to Frank.
   Q: (Inaudible) _ that your concerned about the stall in the
conventional force talks. And some people are saying that
conventional forces is now the real litmus test of Soviet
intentions given the developments in Eastern Europe. If they don't
pull those troops back out of Eastern Europe, then that tells you
something about their ultimate intentions. How do you _
   A: I'd say _ well, I think that _ I think that that's a good
point and one that I expect the Soviets would want to dispel
through action, because I don't get the feeling that they are
opposed to CFE agreements. I do think, for complicated reasons
involving Eastern Europe, that this _ the talks haven't gone as far
or as fast as I would like to see them. But read carefully what
Shevardnadze and Genscher allegedly talked about yesterday, and
Genscher will be here talking about that, and maybe we can find
some way at the summit or before the summit to move CFE forward.
It's important, and I think it does send a bad signal if the
Soviets look like they're refusing to go forward and don't want to,
say, pull forces out of countries in accordance with previous
deals. Yeah? Last one.
   Q: Mr. President, a few weeks ago, in answer to a question about
statehood for D.C., you suggested that voting representation might
be a better alternative and you would consider it. What
consideration have you given it, and what would _
   A: None so far, and I'm opposed to statehood for the District.
   Q: Could you please explore the representation question. What
did you have in mind when you talked about that?
   A: About what?
   Q: About voting representation rather than _
   A: Hadn't really got it in mind. Interested in talking about it.
Have done nothing about it at all except to continually restate my
opposition, because this is a federal city, to statehood for the
District.
   Q: So the statehood bill now pending would be vetoed?
   A: Well, I haven't even see the legislation. I don't whether
Senate and House have agreed on a bill, but I think my position is
very clear, and I'm not going to sign a statehood bill, so I don't
want to be under any false colors on this. I've said that over the
years, and I have not changed my position. Thank you.
   Q: Could I follow up on that?
   A: That's a follow-up on a follow-up. Now, come on. I've got to
go see the president of Haiti.
   Q: Yes, sir. You had premised your opposition to statehood the
last time on the inordinate share of federal funds that went into
the local budget, and I think that's a thing that has been
clarified since then. Could you just tell us why you're _
   A: Marlin had to clean up what I said.
   Q: Right. Could you tell us why you're opposed to statehood,
since that is not a factor?
   A: Because it's a federal city. That's it. Thank you.

   Israel will not allow U.N. observers into the
occupied territories to safeguard the Palestinian population even
if the U.N. Security Council approves the proposal, Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens said today
   Also today, a 15-year-old Palestinian died afer being shot by
soldiers in an overnight clash, and the army lifted curfews in the
West Bank that had confined about a million Palestinians to their
homes since Sunday.
   Refugee camps and towns in the Gaza Strip remained under
stay-at-home orders, except for three small villages. The curfews
were to quell rioting that began Sunday when an apparently deranged
Israeli shot and killed seven Arabs.
   Palestinians have requested U.N. observers to protect the 1.7
million Arabs in the occupied territories from the Israeli army.
Most of the 710 Palestinians killed in the 29-month-old uprising
have been slain by army gunfire.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to propose the observer
force to a Friday session of the 15-nation council in Geneva. U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the United States is
prepared to discuss the issue.
   But Arens said today he hoped the security council would not
approve the force. ``I hope that this is not going to take place,''
he said.
   If it does, he said, ``Israel would not accept U.N. observers on
territory under Israeli control.''
   Israeli officials say Israel is legally responsible for
administering the territory, seized in war, and that foreign
observers are already present in the form of U.N. relief staff, Red
Cross officials, foreign aid workers and journalists.
   ``We feel there is no justification for the stationing of U.N.
observers in areas that are legitimately under Israeli control and
came under Israeli control as a result of Arab aggression in
1967,'' Arens said.
   Arens said Israel was counting on the United States to veto the
U.N. resolution. He said it was crucial that Israel get a chance to
explain that a veto was of ``the utmost importance.''
   But Baker's surprise statement Wednesday was taken as a further
sign of Israel's deteriorating relations with the United States.
Arens conceded coordination with the Bush administration recently
had ``not been as a close as it had been in the past.''
   But the foreign minister said he expected the situation to
improve once Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir forms a new government,
which he is expected to do in the next two weeks.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres also rejected the idea of observers
but blamed Shamir for plummeting relations with the United States.
   ``The question is not one act or another by the United States.
The question is the deterioration in relations between us and the
United States that is getting stronger,'' he said on Israel radio.
   The mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
unidentified senior ministers in Likud, Shamir's party, as saying
President Bush was conducting a personal vendetta against Shamir.
   Also today, Bernard Kouchner, a French government minister
responsible for humanitarian aid, visited the Gaza Strip. Israel
radio said a Soviet delegation was also en route to inspect the
occupied areas after the recent bloodshed.
   ``Gaza looks like a city of ghosts where women walk around with
babies in their arms in order to buy food,'' Israel radio quoted
Kouchner as saying.
   Since the rioting began Sunday, 15 Palestinians have been killed
in clashes with the army or in confrontations with Israeli
civilians.
   In Washington, President Bush said he was ``deeply troubled'' by
the escalation of violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``I'm worried about it. I am troubled about the loss of human
life ... I think particularly of children in this kind of
situation,'' Bush said.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, hospital officials said
Mohammed Samir Salha, 15, died today after being admitted with
plastic bullet wounds in the head and chest. He was shot during an
army raid on the village of Kibiya.
   On Wednesday night, an 8-year-old Palestinian, Mustafa Awad El
Fajem, was fatally shot in the head in the Gaza village of Bani
Suheila. His death prompted an immediate protest.

   A white ex-convict faces a murder charge in
the slaying of a black man killed because of racial hatred,
authorities said today.
   Daniel Amos Pilot, 34, also faces an attempted murder charge for
allegedly wounding the victim's companion with a gunshot to the
back that left him paralyzed, Sheriff Tom Purvis said.
   Pilot was arrested Wednesday after an anonymous tip and jailed
without bond, the sheriff said. Pilot recently was paroled from
prison time he was serving for a 1986 felony conviction of
receiving stolen property.
   Darren Jessie, 21, was shot to death March 31 and Joseph O'Cain,
17, was wounded. They were sitting in a car outside a grocery store
in Theodore, a predominantly white Mobile suburb.
   Jessie's mother, Catherine McCants, said her son was shot
because he was dating a white clerk at the store.
   Purvis said the fatal attack resulted from Pilot's ``hatred for
blacks,'' but investigators concluded Pilot was unaware of the
interracial romance. The sheriff called the shooting unprovoked.
   He said Pilot and another man went to the store to buy beer
before the shooting occurred at 7 p.m. as Jessie and O'Cain waited
outside for Jessie's girlfriend to get off work.
   O'Cain told police a white man approached and asked Jessie about
buying marijuana. He told them they didn't use marijuana, then the
shots were fired.
   Jessie was shot in the head while seated in the car. O'Cain fled
toward the grocery store, was shot in the back and stumbled into
the store, where he collapsed.
   Pilot's associate was not identified or charged, but the sheriff
said authorities know his whereabouts.
   O'Cain was left paralyzed from the waist down by a bullet that
severed his spine. O'Cain was returned to Mobile Infirmary Tuesday
with a blood clot related to his injury and was listed in fair
condition, said hospital spokeswoman Kim Mayer.

   Thousands of students shouting
anti-Japanese slogans burned Japanese flags and clashed with police
in three cities today to protest President Roh Tae-woo's trip to
Tokyo, police and news reports said.
   During the first day of the trip today, Japanese Emperor Akihito
expressed regret for Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean
peninsula. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu later was more
explicit, expressing ``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for
Japanese colonial actions.
   Roh said the two countries ``should strive to remove the dark
shadow of history,'' but Koreans had hoped for a more direct
apology from the emperor.
   Also today, a radical student, 23-year-old Im Chong-suk, leader
was sentenced to 10 years in prison after his conviction for
anti-state activity in sending a colleague to Communist North Korea.
   In another development regarding labor unrest, a union
representing 27,000 workers at the country's biggest auto plant
signed a new contract with the Hyundai Motor Co. to end a strike in
the southern city of Ulsan that began May 15. However, several
hundred workers at the plant staged a sit-in to protest the
agreement, which was not voted on by the union membership.
   Yonhap, the national news agency, said violent anti-Japanese and
anti-U.S. protests occurred at more than a dozen schools in Seoul,
Kwangju and Taegu, involving a total of about 6,000 militant
students.
   ``Let's oppose Roh Tae-woo's trip, which sells out our national
pride,'' students shouted at Yonsei University in Seoul.
   The students say Roh's three-day visit, which began today, is
intended to deepen South Korea's economic dependency on Japan and
strengthen military ties among South Korea, Japan and the United
States.
   About 300 students cheered as they burned an effigy of Roh
wrapped in a Japanese flag, then fought police with firebombs and
rocks outside the Yonsei campus.
   In downtown Seoul, one student used a cigarette lighter to set
fire to one of hundreds of white-and-red Japanese flags hung
alongside the South Korean flag on the city's main boulevard,
police said. The student was arrested.
   The student claimed his family was treated harshly during
Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea and could not bear to see
the Japanese flag flown alongside that of Korea, police said.
   Many Koreans have felt Roh should not have gone to Japan without
assurances of a clear-cut apology from Emperor Akihito for Japan's
colonial rule.
   In a brief speech at a state dinner tonight, Akihito never used
the word apology but referred to the ``unfortunate past between us
for a period in this century.'' The emperor said: ``I think of the
sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period,
which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the
deepest regret.''
   In Seoul, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
Akihito's speech. Vice Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   Critics in South Korea say Roh is using the trip to boost his
popularity, which has dropped due to rising prices, labor unrest
and political infighting.
   Students also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea, saying they hinder unification of the
peninsula with North Korea.

   Former hostage Frank Reed will return home
Sunday from the U.S. military base where he underwent medical
checkups after 42 months in captivity in Lebanon, his daughter said
today.
   Marilyn Langston, 33, said Reed called her this morning to tell
her he would come Sunday to Malden, where his wife and 9-year-old
child live with his mother.
   Since he returned to the United States, Reed has been held under
observation at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force
Base.
   ``It will be exciting to have him come across Massachusetts
soil,'' Langston said.
   Reed's wife Fahima shared the excitement. ``I'm delighted. I
can't wait,'' Mrs. Reed said. She and their son, Tarek, saw Reed in
Frankfurt, West Germany, when he was released.
   Langston said Reed's 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, who
didn't travel to Germany, was especially eager to see her son.
   ``I think what's kept her going for the past three and a half
years is (that) this day will come. She's been weary lately and
she's just anxious to see him and once she sees him and touches him
that will be very, very wonderful for her,'' Langston said.
   Reed was head of the private Lebanese International School in
1986 when he was seized from his car by gunmen. He was held by
Moslem extremists for the next 3{ years.
   Released last month, Reed, 56, told of being beaten when he
tried to escape and of being chained and blindfolded for months at
a time.
   Thursday, Langston said her father told her he had regained
about 15 pounds of the 50 pounds he lost. She also says his energy
has much improved.
   ``He's been playing golf. They've had him out on the golf course
at the base. He's also been undergoing physical therapy to get him
going.'' Langston said.
   Upon his return, Reed will be taken home by limousine with a
police escort, Langston said. She said she believed he would be in
the city's Memorial Day parade.

simple wooden coffin into a shallow cement-lined trench.
   ``The Sandinistas look at us like we're garbage,'' said Juan
Maria Gutierrez Cano, who worked with Ramirez at the Montelimar
sugar farm and refinery.
   The 17-year-old Ramirez, an anti-Sandinista sugar worker, died
Tuesday in a clash with Sandinista-controlled police. He was buried
Wednesday.
   In death, he became a martyr to the sugar workers and a symbol
of the complex tensions that grip Nicaragua a month after the end
of 10 years of revolutionary Sandinista government.
   The workers, trying to oust the Sandinista-appointed director of
the Montelimar sugar complex, said truckloads of demonstrators were
ambushed Tuesday by police who fired tear gas, shot out tires,
killed Ramirez and wounded four other workers.
   ``When they fired the tear gas, I just ran,'' said worker Marco
Torres.
   An official of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's
government said police had disobeyed orders to avoid violence.
   Police officers refused comment Wednesday evening when
Associated Press reporters visited the district headquarters at San
Rafael del Sur.
   But a Sandinista army lieutenant was angry enough to talk _ even
though he apparently wasn't supposed to.
   ``These people have backward minds,'' he said, refusing to give
his name.
   He admitted police tried to stop the sugar workers from driving
25 miles north to the capital of Managua for a demonstration. He
said workers threw rocks and surrounded a police car before the
shooting started.
   The labor trouble began only five days after Mrs. Chamorro took
office April 25, when most of the 2,200 workers abandoned the
Sandinista union and joined the pro-Chamorro Nicaraguan Workers
Union.
   The administrators, led by director Jose Leon Roman, fired
pro-Chamorro workers, the workers said. They docked workers a day's
pay for holding union meetings, even though the meetings occurred
at night after a full day's work in the fields.
   The accusations from workers at Ramirez' funeral became fierce.
Roman didn't improve sanitation, the clinic was poor, food was bad.
   ``He wouldn't take down the Sandinista campaign posters even
after Daniel (Ortega) lost,'' said Nicolas Gutierrez. The
administration building was painted with a wall-size slogan: ``With
Daniel as President _ Jose Leon Roman.''
   One worker said the Sandinistas were womanizers, spending their
time at the beach resort. They bought cattle with the cafeteria
money and sold it at a profit, said another. They bought fine
whiskey, the best soft drinks, paid for dance bands with company
funds, said another.
   ``These are false charges, inventions to get everybody
excited,'' said the Sandinista lieutenant. ``The director is an
honest man.''
   In the last 15 days, the lieutenant said, workers have
threatened administrators, spit at soldiers and yelled epithets and
insults at the military post that guards the road to the refinery.
   The workers said they were intimidated because administrators,
Sandinista union officials and soldiers all carried AK-47s, the
Soviet-designed assault rifle.
   But most of the workers, the lieutenant said, carry machetes
used to cut sugar cane.
   No machetes were seen at Ramirez's funeral.
   The sugar refinery at Montelimar is itself a symbol. It is only
a mile from the Pacific coast, a mile from Nicaragua's finest beach
resort, and once belonged to dictator Anastasio Somoza's family.
   The Sandinistas nationalized it promptly when they took power in
1979, but Sandinismo was never popular, workers said.
   The administration and Sandinista buildings were closed
Wednesday. Residents of the small town around the refinery said
none of the 50-odd administrators and Sandinista union officials
had been seen since Tuesday night.
   A 15-foot-high yellow tractor with blown tires was parked at one
entrance, and several 26-wheel cane trucks with shot-out tires sat
two miles up the road, where the clash occurred.
   Twenty-five policemen have been restricted to quarters while the
investigation proceeds. The workers say they've been promised Roman
will be replaced.
   At the cemetery in San Bartolo, the workers mourned Ramirez,
although he hadn't worked at the refinery for long.
   ``He didn't participate in anything,'' said Gutierrez Cano, who
after 37 years earns 185,000 cordobas, or about 77 cents, a day as
a tractor operator.
   Ordinary workers earn 105,000 cordobas, or about 44 cents, a
day, but that did not seem to be a major concern.
   ``It's the Sandinista aggression against the workers. They
threatened us. And they'd do things we didn't like and say they
were doing them in our name,'' said Octavio Acevedo Villareal, one
of the opposition union organizers.
   ``These people are really arbitrary,'' said the Sandinista
lieutenant, interviewed a half-hour later. ``Even the devil doesn't
scare us. We will defend ourselves.''

   Anti-government rioters angered by the
death of an opposition leader set fire to public buildings and a
French Consulate and held 10 oil executives hostage today, informed
sources said. France sent troops to protect its citizens.
   Demonstrators demanded the government withdraw forces from
Gabon's No. 2 city, Port Gentil. They also used trucks to block the
airport runway of the city, accessible only by air or sea, informed
sources said.
   In Libreville, the capital, groups of demonstrators
systematically attacked and burned public buildings and property
belonging to President Omar Bongo and his close associates,
witnesses said.
   The protests began Wednesday in Port Gentil and Libreville after
the death of Joseph Rendjambe, secretary-general of the Gabon
Progress Party. Protesters blame Bongo for the death of the
opposition leader, a native of Port Gentil, 100 miles south of
Libreville, the capital.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry announced today that a
Frenchmen taken hostage Wednesday _ its consul general in Port
Gentil _ was released. Nevertheless, it said it was sending an
unspecified number of reinforcements into this former French colony
to bolster its 500-member force.
   Military sources in France said 150 legionnaires from a
parachute regiment left for Gabon this afternoon. A company of
infantrymen also is expected to go to the African nation.
   The kidnapped oil executives were identified as seven Frenchmen
working for the French oil company Elf, and a Briton, a Gabonese
and a Frenchman working for Shell Petroleum of Gabon, said the
sources, who refused to be identified further.
   The abductors of diplomat Jean Duffau had demanded France
intervene to help remove Bongo.
   Rendjambe was found dead Wednesday in a hotel room with what
appeared to be needle marks on his abdomen. The cause of death was
not immediately known.
   Following news of the death, several hundred protesters in
Libreville were turned back as they tried to march to the
presidential palace. Some of the crowd then set fire to the hotel
where Rendjambe's body was found, and to a neighboring movie
theater.
   Demonstrators also attacked and set fire to buildings and
property belonging to Bongo and his close associates, witnesses
said. The violence appeared to be confined to suburbs of the city.
   In Port Gentil, several government buildings reportedly were
burned. On Wednesday, protesters burned the French Consulate in the
city, birthplace of Rendjambe. Bongo called out army troops and
imposed a curfew.
   On Monday, the Gabon government installed a multiparty system.
National elections are scheduled for September.
   Bongo has ruled Gabon, an oil-exporting country with a
population of 1.2 million, since 1967. He declared a one-party
state in 1968 and has been re-elected unopposed four times, most
recently in November 1986.

   Plastic trash is continuing to litter beaches
and choke wildlife because boaters ignore laws that forbid dumping
garbage overboard, the Center for Marine Conservation said Thursday.
   ``Some people are annoyed by the trash, some are surprised, and
most don't seem to care,'' center spokeswoman Kathy O'Hara said at
a news conference where the floor was littered with plastic
bottles, cups and bags similar to the type of trash collected
during the group's second annual national beach cleanup.
   ``We've got trash on our beaches and it's time to acknowledge it
and clean it up,'' she said.
   The center said the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and
the Chesapeake Bay suffered the most from off-shore generated waste
because of the large volume of commercial and recreational boating
in those waters.
   Two-thirds of the trash picked up by the center's 65,000
volunteers was plastic _ eating utensils, lids, cups and tampon
applicators. At one beach in in Kahoolawe, Hawaii, 6 tons of debris
was removed.
   ``Plastic trash not only lasts longer, it kills wildlife,''
O'Hara said.
   During the clean up, workers found a whale tangled in plastic
fishing line and a brown pelican that had hanged itself from
plastic wire caught in a tree, O'Hara said.
   Spokeswoman Lisa Younger said cruise ships were the worst
offenders of dumping trash overboard, especially off the Florida
coast en route to the Caribbean.
   In addition, waste from commercial ship galleys and from
recreational boats is clogging beaches around the U.S. coastline,
she said.
   ``Sailors have been taught for decades that trash is dumped
overboard,'' O'Hara said. ``But we're trying to teach them that
plastics, unlike paper and food, don't just sink to the bottom and
disappear.''
   Sailors, she said, have been ore responsive when they hear the
effect the plastics have on marine life.
   Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships, known as the MARPOL Treaty, forbids at-sea
dumping of plastic materials and regulates the distance from shore
that all other solid waste materials may be dumped.
   But O'Hara said the Coast Guard, which polices the waterways,
doesn't have the money or time to enforce the treaty efficiently.
   The Coast Guard, she said, is investigating complaints about
cruise lines. If the lines are found guilty, they could be fined
$25,000 for each violation.
   O'Hara said new degradable plastics were not a solution because
they simply break down into smaller pieces, which can still be
ingested by fish and birds and can poison them.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered in a meeting with
Lithuanian parliamentarians today to call off economic sanctions
against the Baltic republic if it suspends its declaration of
independence, a journalist said.
   The Soviet president told the four lawmakers he does not oppose
Lithuania leaving the Soviet Union but that this would take several
years and that first the republic must freeze its independence
declaration, according to Henrikas Savickas, deputy director of the
Lithuanian news agency ELTA.
   In a telephone interview from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius,
Savickas said Gorbachev also offered to suspend economic sanctions
while the Kremlin and leaders of the Baltic republic negotiate. The
talks could start soon, Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev initiated the meeting in a telephone call to the
Lithuanian government office in Moscow on Wednesday night, Savickas
said.
   Soviet media carried no immediate report of the meeting.
   On Wednesday, Lithuania's legislature offered to shelve some
laws promoting independence _ but not the declaration itself _ in
an effort to draw the Kremlin into negotiations.
   But Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said today that the
Lithuanian offer was not sufficient to bring Kremlin leaders to the
negotiating table. He told reporters Lithuania must suspend the
declaration itself before talks can begin.
   He said he was not fully familiar with Lithuania's resolution,
but ``if there was no mention of the (independence) declaration,
then there is no basis for further discussion.''
   ``I think that they have not made a single step forward and have
not withdrawn from their position,'' Ryzhkov told the unofficial
Interfax news agency.
   Lithuania's resolution, adopted by a vote of 74-15, with 10
abstentions, did not spell out which laws might be suspended.
   Soviet officials have objected to measures passed by the
secessionist parliament to create a system of special
identification cards for Lithuanian citizens, bar Soviet army draft
boards in Lithuania, and establish Lithuanian control over its
borders.
   The resolution said the republic was prepared ``to temporarily
suspend, for the period of official interstate negotiations, those
actions and decisions arising from realization of the March 11,
1990, acts of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania
related to interests that could be defined by both parties as
objects of negotiations.''
   The Lithuanian Supreme Council, or legislature, met for half a
day today, and a parliamentary spokesman said Ryzhkov's rejection
of the resolution was not discussed.
   Gorbachev has insisted Lithuania and its sister republics,
Latvia and Estonia, retreat from independence. Latvia and Estonia
have made more cautious moves toward independence.
   Baltic leaders have said they are willing to compromise, but
will not surrender their goal of seceding from the Soviet Union,
which forcibly annexed the three republics in 1940.
   Gorbachev has responded to Lithuania's independence drive by
cutting off oil, natural gas and key raw materials. Since energy
supplies were cut off on April 18, industrial production has
dropped sharply, traffic has thinned and 19,000 people have been
thrown out of work.
   The gasoline shortage might force Lithuanian authorities to stop
all but emergency transport, driving another 28,000 people into
unemployment, officials said Wednesday.
   The Lithuanian Ministry of Energy today halted the sale of
gasoline to individual car owners, limiting fuel supplies to
emergency vehicles, food trucks and transport, ELTA said.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, in an appeal adopted
by the Supreme Council, said Soviet sanctions ``openly undermine
social guarantees of fulfillment of civil rights and legitimate
citizens' interests, are destroying the economy of the Republic of
Lithuania and are creating mass unemployment.''
   The appeal urged the nations of the world to exert pressure on
the Soviet Union ``so that it will discontinue its inhumane action
against the inhabitants of the Republic of Lithuania that violate
norms of international law.''
   In Estonia, meanwhile, pro-Moscow workers today ended a
three-day strike protesting the independence drive. They returned
to their jobs at Gorbachev's request, a correspondent for the
republic's ETA news agency said.

   The Senate, responding to a Supreme Court
decision a year ago, voted today to forbid the use of the death
penalty against mentally retarded individuals convicted of capital
crimes.
   ``Just because the Supreme Court says we can do it doesn't mean
we should,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told colleagues
debating an omnibus crime bill. The court ruled last year that
putting mentally retarded persons to death in capital cases is
permissible.
   The Senate defeated 59-38 an amendment that would have limited
the death penalty protection for the mentally retarded to those who
don't know the difference between right and wrong.
   It acted as President Bush called on Congress to approve ``a
good, strong anticrime bill'' without the curbs on semiautomatic
assault weapons that the Senate upheld Wednesday as part of their
anticrime package.
   Critics of the Senate bill said almost every defendant facing a
death sentence would claim to be mentally retarded under the
legislation. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called it a ``soft ...
liberal approach.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., told the Senate that as a prosecutor
he once became so frustrated with a ``heavy-lidded, slack-jawed''
murder suspect who claimed to have have mental problems that he
declared: ``You sick slob!''
   He said the suspect was later released and ``sliced his wife up
into 83 sections ... These are people who are human only in the
sense of anatomical essence and they are bums,'' declared Simpson.
   Bush told a news conference, ``I sent a crime bill to the
Congress and would like to see it enacted as a law enforcement
bill.''

   The president said today he supports limitations on the number
of rounds of ammunition that could be carried in semiautomatic
weapon clips, but restated his opposition to the ban on the
manufacture and importation of nine semiautomatics.
   ``Let's get a good strong anti-crime bill and then we can have a
debate about what they want to do'' on automatic weapons issues,
said Bush, a longtime member of the National Rifle Association.
``The automatic weapon part does not have my support ... and I wish
the Congress would stop adding matters of this nature.''
   Several lawmakers said in the aftermath of Wednesday's vote that
the gun issue might not be fully settled.
   ``We've known for a long time we were going to have to deal with
anti-gun legislation, and I don't regard today's vote as the final
word,'' Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Wednesday.
   The 52-48 vote was a defeat for the National Rifle Association,
which had pushed hard to kill the restrictions.
   The measure would ban the import of five foreign-made weapons
and outlaw the manufacture of four other varieties in this country.
The bill would not bar possession or sale of the weapons.
   Senate critics of the bill said assault weapons are not
functionally different from semiautomatic hunting rifles with their
traditional brown wooden stocks.
   They said the restrictions would lead to more stringent curbs on
all weapons and that in any case criminals could easily get the
weapons illegally. Hatch said they would cause ``the persecution of
honest, law-abiding citizens.''
   Richard F. Gamble, president of Colt's Manufacturing Co., said
Wednesday in Hartford, Conn., the vote was a ``sad and dishonest
effort to make the public think the politicians are actually doing
something about crime.''
   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who two years ago won an NRA
``legislator of the month'' award, scoffed at claims that the
weapons would be used for hunting.
   ``There are too many bullet holes in blue suits,'' DeConcini
said. ``There are too many women weeping over coffins. There are
too many children without fathers. It's time to stop the carnage.''
   The plan would ban the import of:
   _Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashikovs.
   _Action Arms Israeli Military Industries Uzi and Galil.
   _Beretta AR-70 (SC-70).
   _Fabrique Nationale FN-FAL, FN-LAR and FNC.
   _Steyr AUG.
   It called for a prohibition on domestic manufacture of:
   _INTRATEC TEC-9.
   _Street Sweeper-Striker 12.
   _Colt AR-15 and CAR-15. Colt now manufactures a new model that
critics say is substantially the same, but DeConcini spokesman Bob
Maynes said it was sufficiently different to be excluded from the
bill.
   _MAC 10 and MAC 11.

   In Japan's clearest effort to grapple with its
militaristic past, Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
on Thursday acknowledged the suffering that Japanese colonial rule
inflicted on Koreans.
   The apology come 45 years after a defeated Japan relinquished
its control of the Korean peninsula. The issue of acknowledging
Japan's past exposed bitter memories in both countries, prompting
demonstrations and arson attacks.
   In a palace banquet for visiting South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo, Akihito went beyond a previous imperial statement and said
he felt the ``deepest regret'' for the pain Japan's colonial rule
caused the Korean people. Earlier Thursday, Kaifu expressed
``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for Japanese actions that
``inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the
Korean peninsula.''
   Kaifu's apology was the most clear-cut ever by a Japanese prime
minister, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. A similar
statement of remorse also was expected to be made by Parliament,
where Roh was to give an address Friday.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its 1910-1945 rule of Korea. The lack of an
explicit apology had been a major obstacle to improving the two
neighbors' relations.
   Roh, replying to Akihito, said the ``dark period'' in
Japanese-Korean relations had been short and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police Thursday. They shouted slogans that
Roh's trip to Japan _ only the second by a South Korean head of
state _ was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Under colonial rule, Koreans had to study Japanese in school and
were taught to worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted
into the Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of
thousands died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan, and the history is skimmed
over in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Before the trip, Kaifu had offered to make a strong statement,
but South Koreans sought a personal apology from Akihito because
Japan's military adventures in the early part of this century often
were made in the name of his father, the late Emperor Hirohito.
   The demands sparked a debate within Japan's government over
whether a strong apology by the emperor would violate
constitutional restraints on his political role.
   In a carefully orchestrated compromise, both governments seemed
to hope that whatever was lacking in the Akihito statement would be
made up for by Kaifu and the Parliament.
   Akihito quoted the words Hirohito used in 1984 during the state
visit of Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan: ``It is indeed
regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a
period in this century, and I believe it should not be repeated
again.''
   That statement, the closest Hirohito ever came to a public
apology, was strongly criticized in South Korea as being too vague
and for not saying who was to blame.
   But Akihito went on to say: ``I think of the sufferings your
people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   Underscoring the importance of Roh's visit, the 150-guest
banquet was the largest at the palace since Akihito assumed the
throne after his father's death. Akihito broke with tradition by
welcoming Roh outside the banquet hall. As they entered the hall,
musicians played ``Hand in Hand,'' theme song of the 1988 Seoul
Olympics.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-jung, who accompanied Roh to Tokyo,
indicated that Japan's apology fell short of Seoul's expectations
but said he believed Japan did ``its best to receive President Roh
with courtesy.''
   Extreme leftists vowed to disrupt the visit, which they call the
first step toward reviving the militarist Japanese empire.
Rightists, who worship the emperor, have strongly opposed calls for
Akihito to apologize.
   Police mobilized 20,000 officers to guard against radical
attacks. Though they said about 300 leftist radicals demonstrated
in two separate Tokyo rallies, no arrests or incidents were
reported.

<TEXT>
   With President Bush and Congress both
reluctant to take the lead in budget talks, a group of the nation's
mayors tried to show them the way Thursday.
   ``Yes, we need new revenues, whether they are called user fees,
revenue enhancement or taxes,'' said Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of
Baltimore, Md., a Democrat.
   Schmoke and other members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors
conducted their own hearing in a Senate hearing room into the tax
and budget debate.
   ``We are helping ourselves, in Baltimore, to the maximum extent
possible. Our property tax rate is double that of our neighboring
counties,'' said Schmoke.
   ``But Baltimore and other urban areas cannot do the job alone.
We need a federal government that cares about our people and has
the economic resources to help us. It is a question of national
leadership,'' he said.
   He said federal taxes should be raised and money diverted from
defense spending to provide for the urgent needs of the nation's
poor.
   The mayors tried to put a human face on deep urban problems with
a series of witnesses who have been unable to find help.
   Valarie White of Baltimore, a 31-year-old mother of five, said
she has been on a waiting list for public housing for eight years.
They live with her parents and other family members, 11 people 
international agreements.
   The Taiwanese also refused to allow Chinese dissidents aboard
and said the ship would not be allowed to return for supplies after
broadcasting.
   Organizers then announced plans to sail to Japan in hopes of
obtaining another transmitter, but the Tokyo government refused
permission for the ship to dock because it was to be used for
illegal broadcasts.
   China repeatedly warned the region's governments not to assist
the boat and refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
broadcasts.
   Although Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party is the sworn enemy of
the Beijing government, tensions between the two sides have eased
in recent years and Taiwan is anxious not to anger the Beijing
government.

   A barrage of rockets hit the Afghan
capital Thursday, killing three people, and government troops
launched offensives in four provinces and killed 26 Moslem
guerrillas, state-run radio said.
   Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said eight
surface-to-surface rockets fell in residential districts of Kabul.
At least 15 people were wounded in the attack, which was blamed on
``Pakistan-backed extremists.'' That is the radio's usual reference
to the guerrillas trying to overthrow the Communist-style
government.
   The guerrillas are based in Pakistan and bankrolled by the
United States, Saudi Arabia and other sympathetic Arab states. They
deny aiming for civilian targets but admit they occasionally
misfire.
   Hundreds of people have been killed and wounded in rocket
attacks on the capital.
   The radio said troops loyal to President Najibullah launched
``clearing operations'' in Laghman, Kandahar, Khost and Nangarhar
provinces. Dozens of insurgents were wounded or surrendered and
weapons, ammunition and explosives were seized or destroyed, it
said.
   It said 26 guerrillas were killed and that one soldier and four
civilians were injured. The reports could not be independently
verified.

<TEXT>
   Israeli-U.S. relations have hit their lowest
point since American anger over the 1982 invasion of Lebanon held
up fighter plane shipments to the Jewish state.
   The differences came into sharp focus Thursday when Israel
rejected calls from the PLO and Arab nations to send U.N. observers
to the Gaza Strip and West Bank to protect Palestinians from
Israeli security forces. On Wednesday, the United States said it
would consider such proposals.
   Israeli-U.S. relations have been tense since President Bush
publicly expressed his opposition to continued Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories. Israel also has refused to go along
with an American peace strategy for the Middle East.
   Then, on Sunday, an Israeli gunman killed seven unarmed Arab
laborers near Tel Aviv, triggering a new wave of clashes between
Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops. Fifteen Palestinians
have been killed and more than 800 injured since then.
   Both Bush and the U.S. State Department have blamed the violence
on the impasse in Mideast peace efforts and urged Israel to
exercise restraint against Palestinian demonstrators.
   Israeli officials contend Sunday's slayings were committed by a
deranged man. They feel Washington has been trying to use the
killings to prod the Jewish state into making concessions to
Palestinians.
   Compounding their anger was Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's statement Wednesday that he would consider the idea of
sending U.N. observers to safeguard the 1.7 million Palestinians
living in the occupied territories.
   The proposal is expected to be raised by PLO Chief Yasser Arafat
before the U.N. Security Council, which meets Friday in Geneva.
Israel condemns the PLO as a terrorist organization.
   Israel has repeatedly rejected further U.N. involvement in
Israeli-held areas. It has accused the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency, which helps Palestinian refugees, of siding with the Arabs
in their conflict with Israel.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Thursday that Israel would not
accept U.N. observers even if the Security Council voted to send
them, saying the territories are ``legitimately under Israeli
control.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said an
observer corps in the areas Israel has occupied since the 1967
Middle East war would be ``an infringement on our sovereignty and
interference in our internal affairs.''
   Pazner, interviewed by telephone, also took issue with the tone
of Washington's condemnations of Sunday's killings.
   ``If it would have been Jews killed and not Arabs, would they
say it was a result of the lack of a peace process?'' Pazner said.
``A madman slaughtered innocent people, but this has nothing to do
with the peace process.''
   Amid the conflict, an Israeli diplomat in Washington, Yoram
Ettinger, secretly cabled Arens this week warning that Israel-U.S.
relations were at a low point, the daily newspaper Haaretz reported.
   He noted increasing sympathy for the PLO and displeasure with
Israel's attempt last month to settle Jews in the Christian Quarter
of Jerusalem's walled Old City, the newspaper said.
   But at a news conference Thursday, Arens denied that Israel's
strong ties with the United States were weakening.
   ``There are disagreements even among the closest of partners,
and we certainly have some disagreements with the United States at
the present time,'' Arens said. ``But in my view, I would not
characterize the situation as deterioration.''
   In the past decade, U.S.-Israeli relations have hit other low
points. The United States objected to Israel's invasion of Lebanon
in 1982 and was angered by a 1985 spy affair involving an American
Jew, Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy analyst who gave secret files
to Israel.
   Shamir's political adviser, Yossi Ben-Aharon, acknowledged the
latest tension. ``The facts are we are witnessing some problems in
relations,'' he said, declining to go into details.
   American tensions with Israel over peace strategies date to
Shamir's refusal in March to accept Baker's proposals for
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo, Egypt.
   Baker saw the planned dialogue as a step toward implementing
Israel's plan for elections in the occupied areas, but Shamir
demanded guarantees that the PLO be excluded from any talks.
   His coalition with the left-of-center Labor Party fell apart in
March because of Likud-Labor differences over agreeing to Baker's
plan.
   Israel also has taken issue with U.S. opposition to settling
Soviet Jewish immigrants in the occupied territories. That conflict
has persisted, although Israeli officials say that only about 200
Soviets have moved to the territories.

<HEAD>Economy Growth Sluggish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy grew at a sluggish annual
rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter, the government said
Thursday.
   The growth was slower than first thought because of what
analysts consider a healthy reduction in business inventories.
   But while the Commerce Department report lowered the
January-March growth rate, it pumped up the inflation rate from 6.5
percent to 6.7 percent _ the highest level since it reached 7.7
percent in the fourth quarter of 1981.
   While the inventory reduction was considered a possible sign of
future growth, the first-quarter gross national product was weaker
than the original 2.1 percent estimate last month and only slightly
improved from the fourth quarter's 1.1 percent rate.
   The growth rates in both quarters were the weakest since the
economy grew at a 0.8 percent rate in the July-September period of
1986. The GNP measures the nation's total output of goods and
services.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, acknowledged it was the second weak number in
succession but said it ``offers the possibility of a quickening''
in the economy as businesses begin restocking their shelves and
backlots.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Co., described the
inventory reduction as ``a healthy correction'' that, combined with
strong consumer demand, could be ``setting the economy up for
sustained growth provided that sales stay up.''
   ``If sales and demand stay up, the economy will continue to
expand ... closer to 2 percent'' this quarter, he said.
   Sinai said there was no sign of any imminent recession in the
report. A recession usually is defined as two consecutive declines
in the GNP.
   Dederick said the sluggishness in the economy was due to
weakness in the manufacturing sector, which ``probably is going to
pick up some speed.''
   ``Construction could well fade, because that was bolstered in
the first quarter by the good weather,'' he said. ``The real key
will be whether we can get some push from the export side because
it doesn't look as if the consumer has any independent strength,
doesn't look as if business spending is going up very much.''
   The Bush administration initially forecast 2.4 percent growth
this year and the new report spells more problems for
administration and congressional budget negotiators as they resumed
talks Thursday on cutting the deficit.
   ``If the slow, near 1 percent growth of the last two quarters
persists, government revenues will be down $15 billion from
projections in 1990 and will be down $45 billion in 1991, greatly
adding to the budget and deficit problems,'' said Richard W. Rahn,
chief economist of U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The first-quarter GNP revision came after additional information
was gathered showing a $8.5 billion downward revision in business
inventories. The department will publish its final reading on the
first-quarter economy next month.
   The price index tied to the GNP jumped from 3.6 percent in the
fourth quarter to 6.7 percent from January through March.
   ``About one-half of the step-up was due to food and energy
prices,'' the department said. ``Large increases in January
followed unusually cold weather in December'' that destroyed crops
and depleted heating fuels.
   The department also received additional information causing a
$9.9 billion upward revision in exports. But it said that was
offset by an upward revision of $9 billion in imports.

   Prince Charles says he's pleased that ecological
concerns are no longer considered ``dotty'' and ``just for people
with sandals and long hair.''
   In his second television documentary, ``The Earth in Balance,''
broadcast on BBC television Wednesday night, Charles warned of the
increasing fragility of the Earth.
   ``We've suddenly become aware of just what a devastating impact
we have made in the world,'' Prince Charles said in the program, on
which he served as both author and host.
   ``Unless we alter our approach I believe that we shall, sooner
rather than later, face a reckoning,'' he said.
   With visual backdrops of Hong Kong's skyline, the canals of
Venice and the Scottish highland wilderness, the prince said
smaller families were one answer to the growing demands people are
making on the globe.
   The prince's first documentary was on his highly critical views
on modern architechture.

   Columnist Jimmy Breslin returned to print
without mentioning his suspension for insulting a Korean-American
reporter and then joking about it on the air.
   In his Newsday column Wednesday, Breslin wrote about a plumber
who follows construction crews around the city, waiting for them to
accidentally break an underground water pipe so he can fix it.
   As a column subject, damage control was not inappropriate.
   The editors of Newsday had suspended the Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist May 9 for two weeks without pay for uttering racial and
sexual slurs against New York Newsday reporter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh
after she criticized a column he wrote on women's roles.
   Breslin, who said the column in question was intended as humor,
issued an apology, which Newsday executives accepted. But they
suspended him after he called a controversial New York radio
personality, Howard Stern, and joked over the air about the
incident.

   Placido Domingo will sing and Rudolf Nureyev will
dance at the Royal Opera House next week in a tribute to Dame
Margot Fonteyn, the ballerina whose New York first night drew 48
curtain calls 41 years ago.
   The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden said Wednesday it expects
Dame Margot, now 71 and retired on her late husband's farm in
Panama, to fly to London for the tribute from her old company, the
Royal Ballet.
   ``It will be a private visit and we have not been informed about
her arrangements here,'' said Amanda Jones, the Royal Ballet
information officer.
   If Dame Margot is present next Wednesday in the royal box with
Princess Margaret, she will be serenaded by Domingo.
   He is scheduled to sing before the company's performance of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' in which the famous ballerina and Nureyev
danced the title roles in 1965. This time, Nureyev, 52, will dance
the less strenuous role of Mercutio.

<HEAD>ACLU Joins Tammy Bakker's Effort for Church in Warehouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is
teaming up with Tammy Faye Bakker in efforts to overturn a zoning
ban against church services in a warehouse area.
   Warren Keiner, the ACLU's Central Florida chairman, said there
is no compelling reason to prohibit religious services in an
industrial area, where peace and quiet are not as important as they
would be in a residential area.
   Mrs. Bakker and her husband, Jim, set up their New Covenant
Ministries in Orlando last year, before he began serving a 45-year
federal prison term in connection with fund-raising activities in
their former PTL television ministry.
   It has been housed in a shopping mall, a hotel, a piano shop and
lately in an industrial park.
   After one Sunday service, Orange County zoning officials said
that while she could operate a broadcasting studio, no church
services would be permitted.
   ``The ACLU takes the position that churches can properly go into
an industrial-zoned area unless there's some overriding public
reason to deny it,'' said Jerry Bornstein, an Orlando lawyer acting
as volunteer counsel for the ACLU in Mrs. Bakker's case.
   Mrs. Bakker, who requested ACLU help last week, will challenge
the zoning ruling at a hearing before the county in July.
   ``Churches are not permitted in industrial zones, and there are
zones that permit churches,'' said assistant county attorney Joel
Prinsell on Wednesday.
   ``We were under the impression that they were seeking a radio
and television studio and offices at this particular location,
which is a permitted use,'' Prinsell said. ``Now they want a
church, which is not a permitted use.''
   ACLU officials say the case centers on the First Amendment's
protection of freedom of religion.
   After discontinuing services, Mrs. Bakker said the ministry had
decided the warehouse was an ideal place not only for its future
broadcasting plans but for use as an assembly hall for supporters
and worshipers.

   A passenger whose head and shoulders were sucked
through the broken window of an airplane at 14,000 feet says his
few seconds of terror won't cause him to stop flying.
   ``I'm 38 today and I'll still be an alive 38 tomorrow. I'm just
happy to be alive,'' said Gale Sears of Portland, Ore.
   Sears said he remembers hearing a loud thud outside the cabin of
Horizon Air Flight 2300 as the plane left Portland on Wednesday
morning for Seattle.
   He settled back, buckled into seat 2E as the 18-seat,
twin-engine Fairchild Metro III climbed to 14,000 feet.
   As the plane began its descent over Olympia, Sears heard a loud
bang _ the sound of the window next to his seat suddenly blowing
out. He was pulled toward a hole where the window had been, and his
world went black. Rain pelted his face and shoulders.
   ``I just remember wondering: What in the world is going on? Is
the plane going to explode? Am I going to go splat? Are we going to
hit the ground?'' Sears later recalled.
   Airline officials said Sears' wide shoulders and two passengers
who grabbed on to him may have saved him from being further sucked
through the roughly 10-by-14-inch opening. He came away with a
stiff neck and puncture wounds in his hands from the window's
shattered glass.
   Oxygen masks were deployed for passengers and the plane made an
emergency descent and safe landing at 8:50 a.m. at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport. Sears was taken to a hospital, where he was
treated and released.
   Sears said he thought he popped back into the plane when the
pressure equalized.
   ``I was still in my seat, but I lay across the lap of the
gentleman next to me. He just held me, he held me.''
   Sears, financial manager for the Oregon National Guard, was on
his way to a National Guard meeting in Harrisburg, Pa.
   ``All I know is that I was only that far from the prophet,'' he
said, holding his fingers an inch apart. ``But it didn't happen,
and I'm extremely lucky.''
   After the accident, a man traveling with Sears passed him a
scribbled note: ``Gale _ you should get first-class.'' A Horizon
representative took Sears to lunch and introduced him to company
executives before they put him on a Horizon flight to Portland for
a free ride home.
   Horizon mechanics were looking at the plane to determine what
caused the window to break. Windows on all 33 of Horizon's
Fairchild Metro IIIs will be checked, said airline spokeswoman
Nancy Hamilton. She said the aircraft involved had only 700 hours
of flying time and that there have been no similar problems on the
airline's other Fairchild planes.
   ``The window was blown out. ... Nothing hit the window,'' she
said. ``It was a completely clean break. As far as we know, it's an
isolated incident. We're trying to determine what caused it.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board said they had assigned investigators to the case.

   A strike by Canadian truck drivers over
proposed tax increases and the U.S.-Canadian free-trade agreement
began disrupting production at auto plants in both nations as it
entered its third day today.
   Canadian Transport Minister Doug Lewis flew today from Ottawa to
Windsor to meet with protest leaders. But when the sides emerged
from a meeting to announce agreement, angry truckers shouted them
down.
   They shouted they would continue the blockades until all the
issues that led to the strike are resolved and they see a written
agreement. Details of what the leaders agreed to were not announced.
   The protest choked off shipments of parts to the General Motors
of Canada Ltd. assembly plant in Ste. Therese, Quebec, where 3,000
workers worked half a shift before being sent home Wednesday.
   Half-shifts were planned at the plant again today. GM also sent
home 11,000 day-shift workers at three plants in Oshawa, Ontario,
because of a lack of parts, spokesman Nick Hall.
   Production also was disrupted at plants run by Chrysler Canada
and Ford of Canada.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and Honda
of America Manufacturing Inc. said production at their U.S. plants
could be curtailed if the protest continued much longer.
   At Fort Erie, Ontario, near Niagara Falls, about 130 trucks
jammed the approaches to the international Peace Bridge today as
the protest spread to New York state's borders.
   The truckers blocked all commercial lanes of the bridge linking
Fort Erie and Buffalo, N.Y., to protest the free trade agreement
with the United States and the goods and services tax that the
Canadian government plans to impose next year.
   Some American truckers have joined the protest, either in
sympathy with the Canadians or because of grievances of their own.
   More than 300 truckers parked their rigs Wednesday along more
than three miles of the highway leading to the Ambassador Bridge
between Windsor and Detroit. They remained there this morning,
parked in a line that led all the way to customs brokerage offices,
blocking only the truck lanes.
   There also were about two dozen rigs on the bridge blocking
truck traffic entering Windsor from Detroit.
   Hundreds more truckers blocked traffic on the Blue Water Bridge
between Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Mich., according to Oscar
Vazquez, bridge safety officer for the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   Quebec truck drivers on Wednesday partially lifted a blockade
that began Monday, but they continued to prevent U.S. trucks from
leaving or entering the province.
   Authorities at the bridges described the protests as peaceful
and said cars were crossing without delays.
   Truckers at Fort Erie said competition from American drivers was
making it impossible for them to stay in business.
   ``The Canadian trucker's going to be extinct,'' said Randy
Blackmore of Chatham, Ontario, a spokesman for the truckers.
``There won't be a Canadian trucker five years from now.''
   The protest was over planned increases in Canadian taxes on
everything from the goods that truckers haul to the tires,
insurance and diesel fuel they buy.
   The Canadian drivers complain that U.S. drivers have been able
to undercut them because they aren't paying nearly as much in
taxes. The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost
all tariffs over a 10-year period, will further handicap Canadian
truckers, they said.
   ``We want the government to take some of these taxes off of
us,'' said Hollie Greer, a trucker from Harrow who parked his truck
in the row of rigs along Huron Church Street in Windsor. ``They are
taxing us to death.''
   A four-hour meeting Wednesday between protest leaders and
Ontario officials produced no agreement to end the blockade
immediately. But Bill Wrye, Ontario minister of transportation,
pledged to increase enforcement of regulations against U.S.
truckers within a few days.

   A 6-year-old who was the object of a search
by thousands of townspeople after he disappeared two weeks ago was
found dead in the back of a station wagon parked outside his home,
police said.
   The body of Matthew Roberts showed no obvious signs of violence,
and the cause of death was not immediately known, Police Chief
Caleb Chandler said today.
   The body was found by passersby who noticed a strong odor from
the car Wednesday night. The boy was in a 2-by-2-foot compartment
in the car, which had been loaned to his family by a friend,
Chandler said.
   Police said they were still investigating the whereabouts of the
car over the past two weeks.
   ``Until the crime lab and medical examiner have completed their
investigations, we have very little to report,'' Chandler said at a
news conference this morning. ``We are not ruling anything out and
we are not leaning in any one direction.''
   Matthew's body was flown to Albuquerque for an autopsy.
   The child disappeared May 8 after he was left with his
76-year-old grandmother while his mother drove to a store,
authorities said. He apparently tried to follow his mother and ran
out of the house before his grandmother could stop him.
   Up to 10,000 people in this town of about 35,000 had joined in
the search, and divers had searched a lake twice. Reported
sightings of the boy came in from Roswell, 100 miles away, and from
nearby Texas.
   ``This search really brought the city together. It's just awful
that it ended that way,'' said Mayor James B. Moss.
   Around the time the body was found, townspeople had been holding
a forum on missing children at a junior high school. Matthew's
parents, Geoff and Debbie Roberts, were there along with a
psychologist and other experts.
   A note was brought in notifying the family that the child's body
had been found. Outside, Mrs. Roberts collapsed. ``Oh, no! Oh, my
God!'' she cried, then fainted. Her husband, who was in tears, had
to carry her from the scene.
   ``We're all saddened and depressed to learn the child is dead.
That's not what we had been praying for,'' the mayor said.
   About 30 citizens, some wearing ``Find Matthew Roberts''
T-shirts, attended the police chief's news conference, many of them
in tears.

   President Bush's decision to renew China's
preferential trade status averts what many Chinese and Americans
had predicted would be a death blow to the 11-year-old relationship.
   But even raising the issue as a way to punish China has
undermined already crumbling ties. And some U.S. congressmen have
said they will fight Bush's decision, compounding the mutual
frustration and resentment.
   Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Bush's
announcement extending China's most-favored-nation trade status for
one year. It came well after government offices closed Thursday.
   The only reaction came from the state Xinhua News Agency.
   ``A small number of Americans, under the pretext of so-called
human rights, opposed the renewal of China's MFN status,'' the
agency wrote. ``Their arguments have been strongly rejected by the
majority of American people, who cherish the long-term interests of
relations between the two countries.''
   China had made clear that raising tariffs on its goods would
lead not just to higher duties on U.S. products and a sharp drop in
trade, but diminished political and cultural contacts as well.
   China fought hard on the issue, mixing veiled warnings with
calls for Washington to be sensible and ``consider the matter from
a long-term perspective,'' as Communist Party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin said recently.
   China also made concessions to critics of its human rights
record by lifting martial law in the Tibetan capital and releasing
211 people jailed for taking part in last year's democracy movement
in Beijing.
   Bush's decision can thus be seen as a Chinese diplomatic
victory, but a limited one.
   China's leaders still have failed to convince the White House or
the U.S. Congress that how they treat political dissidents is an
internal matter on which the United States has no right to comment.
   In making his announcement, Bush said he was not condoning
China's suppression of dissent and urged Chinese leaders to improve
their human rights record.
   Many Americans still believe China's leaders should be punished
in some way for having ordered the army to fire on unarmed
pro-democracy protesters last June, when hundreds and perhaps
thousands were killed.
   Given such deep differences in outlook, continued friction
between Beijing and Washington is inevitable. There will be no lack
of new occasion for conflict.
   For example, the World Bank is scheduled to consider several new
loans to China next week. Although China insists such loans should
not be linked to politics, the United States has blocked past
loans, making exceptions only for those considered for humanitarian
purposes.
   Fang Lizhi, China's most famous dissident, and his wife, Li
Shuxian, remain in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a constant irritant
in relations. There appears no progress toward winning them safe
passage from China. Jiang reiterated recently the couple must admit
their guilt and promise not to fight the government again.
   The more than 30,000 Chinese students in the United States will
become a growing point of friction if, as their studies finish,
significant numbers fail to return home. Bush has said those who
were in the United States last June can stay at least until Jan. 1,
1994, if they fear persecution at home.
   Even with the extension of the special status, bilateral trade
and investment will be a source of controversy. Legislation
affecting China's textile exports is pending, and some lawmakers
have called for a ban on Chinese products made by convicts.
   In addition, a serious slump in the Chinese economy has kept
many U.S. investors away in the past year, but China sees their
absence as political and resents it.

<HEAD>`Cheers' Star Kelsey Grammer Jailed for Drunken Driving Probation
Violation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kelsey Grammer of ``Cheers'' was jailed
Thursday for a drunken driving probation violation.
   The 35-year-old actor, who plays brainy psychiatrist Frasier
Crane on the hit NBC series, surrendered to the Van Nuys Muncipal
Court and was taken immediately to County Jail. He showed up in
court with a toothbrush stuck in his shirt pocket.
   Since his February 1988 conviction for drunken driving, he has
failed to make several court appearances to prove he completed a
drug rehabilitation program.
   Municipal Court Commissioner Patricia Schwartz last week ordered
Grammer to serve a 30-day sentence for failing to attend the
program and failing to serve 10 days on a state road crew.
   The commissioner also ordered Grammer to show up in court
Thursday with proof he served at least one day of work on a
California Department of Transportation road cleanup crew and
enrolled in a 90-day drug rehab program.
   Documentation presented by Grammer on Thursday established he
had completed those obligations, the court clerk said.
   Grammer still faces possible possession of cocaine charges.
   In April 1988, police stopped his car for expired license tags
and a routine check showed an arrest warrant had been issued for
missing a court appearance. While riding in the police car, a
packet of cocaine fell from his pocket, officers said.
   Earlier this month, Grammer surrendered to authorities on arrest
warrants involving both the drunken driving and cocaine arrests.
   The incarceration shouldn't affect production of the show, which
is currently shut down between seasons.

<HEAD>US Cites Peace Process in Opposing Arafat Visa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday it opposed
a visa for PLO leader Yasser Arafat to attend a U.N. Security
Council meeting in New York because it wanted to keep attention
focused on the lack of Middle East peace talks.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said a controversy
over granting a visa to the Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman would have shifted the focus from the central issue of the
absence of Mideast negotiations.
   The U.N. session on the Middle East, which begins Friday, was
shifted from New York to Geneva to accommodate Arafat. He was
denied a U.S. visa two years ago on the ground he was an accessory
to PLO terrorism against Americans and Israelis.
   This time, the State Department took a softer line in explaining
why it was ``unenthusiastic'' about allowing Arafat to come to New
York.
   ``We felt a major controversy over a visa would shift the focus
from what is really the issue in the Middle East _ the absence of a
peace process,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. She said that was the ``main
reason'' the United States opposed Arafat's entry.
   Rather than risk being turned down, Arafat had approached the
State Department indirectly through U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. The department replied directly to the PLO in
Tunis, where Arafat maintains his headquarters.
   ``We made it clear we were unenthusiastic,'' Ms. Tutwiler said,
adding that the department had no objection to Arafat speaking in
Geneva.
   Asked about the terrorism charges of 1988, Ms. Tutwiler replied,
``I cannot compare apples and oranges. We are sitting here in
1990.''
   In December 1988, a month after his previous visa request was
denied, Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and said he recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   He took those steps at the urging of the State Department, which
immediately opened talks with the PLO.
   The PLO covenant still calls for the dismantling of the Jewish
state.

<HEAD>NATO's Quick Reaction Warplanes Remain at Full Alert Under New
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under a new plan to relax response times in
war, NATO's combat planes will remain at full alert but some
front-line troops will have twice as long to react to an attack,
the NATO military commander said Thursday.
   U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, the supreme allied commander in
Europe, said the response times of air and ground forces in Western
Europe could be eased even more with additional cuts in Red Army
troops in Eastern Europe.
   ``As more changes occur, we will probably lengthen the time for
saddling up and moving out,'' Galvin said during an interview at
his official residence in Mons, about 40 miles southwest of
Brussels.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other defense ministers of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced Wednesday the decision
to ``lower the readiness and availability of a number of our
standing forces.''
   They attributed the action to the diminished military threat
from the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the increased warning time of a
full-scale Soviet attack.
   The move is part of a series of measures likely to be taken in
the coming months to revise the military strategy that guided the
alliance in the Cold War years.
   Galvin said he issued the order Wednesday to put the new
response schedules into effect July 1.
   ``There are significant changes,'' he said.
   The time targets, he said, ``relate to opposing forces. The
Soviets have pulled back some of their forces (from Eastern
Europe). The Warsaw Pact is not the same by any means.''
   ``There is no use keeping as many people snugged right up close
on response times unless it's absolutely necessary,'' he said.
``With the changes (in the East bloc), it's not quite as
necessary.''
   But he cautioned the West could easily quicken response times if
the East-West situation deteriorated. ``We can tighten them up
again if we have to,'' he said.
   He said the precise schedules for the new response times were
classified but that the reaction time for some ground forces will
be doubled. Response time refers to the amount of time it takes a
unit of soldiers or an air crew to get ready and react to an enemy
attack.
   ``Certain things that were a matter of minutes, I could change
to hours, and things that were hours, I could change to several
more hours and even to days,'' he said.
   All ground and most air forces, including helicopters and
surface-to-air missile units, in Europe will be affected by the
changes, he said.
   There will be no easing of the reaction time for full-alert
interceptor planes, which have only a few minutes notice to be in
the air to fend off an attack.
   ``Quick-reaction aircraft are still on the same alert basis,''
he said.
   He predicted their status would remain unchanged, even after a
new review of the changing military situation in Europe.
   ``As long as we have forces, we want some quick-reaction
capability that is right down to a matter of minutes to get
airborne,'' he said. Well under 100 planes, he said, are ready to
do that.
   He said it was easier for Western forces to respond to a ground
attack than an air assault. ``Air movement is very fast,'' he said.
   The changes, he said, could mean substantial cost savings over
time.
   He said it was expensive, for instance, to keep an anti-aircraft
missile crew, with backup assistance, at a high level of readiness.
   Galvin said NATO guidelines give him the authority to relax the
reaction times to a certain extent but additional reductions would
require agreement of the member nations.

   Kids are saying no to plastic across the Twin
Cities after a cafeteria sit-in by grade schoolers prompted a
school board decision to switch from disposable lunch trays and
cups in favor of washable dishes.
   Mounds View school officials say they will spend at least
$145,000 to equip eight grade schools with dishwashers and related
equipment _ three schools next year and five the year after that.
   Students at Bel Air started the movement after hearing their
teacher talk about the need to recycle and attending Earth Day
festivities. They passed around a petition, which prompted school
officials to call in a plastics representative to preach the
benefits of plastic.
   That made them decide to stage a cafeteria sit-in.
   When they refused to return to class, they were suspended for a
day and a half. While banished from class they cleaned up a
neighborhood park.

<HEAD>Bush Renews China Trade Benefits but Won't for Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush set off a new row with Congress
Thursday by unconditionally renewing China's most-favored-nation
trade status for one year. He said it's too early to talk about
giving the same trade benefits to Moscow.
   Despite China's continued repression of the pro-democracy
movement, Bush said, its emigration policies qualify it for the
preferential trade treatment while the Soviet Union's does not.
   ``I don't think this is a reward to Beijing. I think it is very
important we keep these commercial contacts,'' said Bush, who
announced what he described as a ``difficult decision'' at a White
House news conference.
   The move, which had been expected, still caused an uproar in
Congress from members of both parties who consider the
administration's China policy too accommodating to the current
leaders in Beijing.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., criticized Bush for
failing to put any conditions on the one-year extension to prod
China toward reforms.
   ``I think he faces some very severe problems here,'' Foley said.
``At the present time, I would say there are not the votes to
approve it.''
   And Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Bush's
decision is ``inconsistent with American values.''
   Mitchell said he would ``aggressively and vigorously'' try to
block Bush's action.
   Congress can do so only by enacting a ``resolution of
disapproval,'' and such a measure was quickly introduced in the
House. The resolution, if passed, could still be vetoed, thus it
would take two-thirds majorities in both chambers to override
Bush's decision.
   The president said his move ``is not a special favor'' to
Beijing. ``It is the basis of everyday trade.''
   As for next week's summit, Bush said ``enormous problems'' face
him and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the four-day
Washington meeting, including the issue of German reunification.
   The United States wants a unified Germany to be a full member of
NATO. The Soviet Union wants it to either be neutral, or have
membership in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   On a more upbeat note, the president said he hoped for
``significant progress'' at the May 31-June 3 meeting on an
agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons and the nailing down of
a pact eliminating chemical weapons.
   He also voiced optimism that some progress would be made in
resolving a stalemate over reducing troops and tanks in Europe.
   ``I don't want to have two ships pass in the night _ the Soviet
Union and the United States. And we've got a lot to talk about,''
Bush said.
   Bush also defended Secretary of State James A. Baker III against
criticism from the political right that he had made too many
concessions in pre-summit arms negotiations last weekend in Moscow.
   ``There is no light between us on that at all,'' Bush said. ``It
doesn't help for me to go out and say who gave the most, who
knuckled under, who took the most heat,'' he added.
   Bush's China trade decision came less than two weeks before the
first anniversary of the bloody June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square
crackdown.
   ``As we mark the anniversary of Tiananmen, we must realize that
by maintaining our involvement with China, we will continue to
promote the reforms for which the victims of Tiananmen gave their
lives,'' Bush said.
   Most-favored-nation status gives China the same preferential
trade treatment _ including lowest-possible tariffs _ that is
extended to most major trading partners. China has had the status
for 10 years.
   Denial would send tariffs rising sharply on some $12 billion in
annual imports from China of textiles, toys and other products.
   The American Association of Exporters and Importers has
estimated that removal of MFN status would have boosted tariffs on
Chinese goods an average 40 percent. The president said these costs
would be passed on to U.S. consumers.
   Bush also said he did not wish to hurt the free-market economy
of Hong Kong. Some $8.5 billion in China-made products each year
are re-exported by Hong Kong to the United States.
   He said removing most-favored-nation status also could endanger
the $6 billion in U.S. goods that China buys each year, including
aircraft, wheat and chemicals.
   While continuing the trade benefits to China, Bush said that it
was premature to discuss bestowing them on the Soviet Union. Under
a 1974 law, Moscow has been denied the benefits because of
repressive policies toward the emigration of Soviet Jews and other
minorities.
   ``MFN is based on emigration and emigration has continued from
China at respectable levels,'' Bush said.
   Moscow is considering such legislation, but a vote won't be held
until after the superpower summit.
   Bush also said there was a ``political climate'' in the United
States that would make it ``extraordinarily difficult'' to grant
most-favored-nation status to the Soviets at this time _
particularly in light of the impasse over Lithuania and other
Baltic republics.
   The standoff between the Kremlin and the rebellious Baltic
states continues to cast a cloud over the upcoming summit, Bush
said. ``I can't tell you I'm encouraged about where it stands right
now,'' he said.
   On other issues, Bush:
   _ Called for restraint by Israeli soldiers involved in clashes
with Palestinians, saying he was ``troubled about the loss of human
life.''
   _ Pledged to work with Congress to protect depositors whose
money is held in savings and loan institutions that go into
default. Administration officials estimate the government may have
to borrow up $130 billion or more.
   _ Said he was pleased with the results so far of deficit-cutting
talks with Congress but declined anew to say whether new taxes
might be required. He voiced unexpected praise for House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a frequent critic, for doing a good
job in leading the budget talks.
   _ Urged Congress to pass ``a good, strong anti-crime bill'' _
but without curbs on semiautomatic weapons that were narrowly
approved in the Senate on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Key Witness in Bensonhurst Trial Arrested on Drug Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The young woman who testified at the Bensonhurst
racial attack trial was arrested on drug possession charges after
she was accused by police of subway fare evasion, a transit
spokesman said Thursday.
   Gina Feliciano, 18, was arrested Wednesday night after two
plainclothes officers saw her and a male companion go through a
subway gate in Brooklyn reserved for Transit Authority employees
and police, said spokesman Al O'Leary.
   Feliciano's companion fled, O'Leary said, and was still at large
Thursday. Arresting officers said 15 vials of a substance they
believe to be crack cocaine fell from Feliciano's purse as she was
searching for identification.
   Feliciano, an admitted drug user, was the prosecution's key
witness at the dual trial of Keith Mondello and Joseph Fama, the
first two defendants tried in the racially motivated killing of
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins. The case has inflamed racial tensions in
the city.
   Hawkins was shot to death in August when he and two friends went
to the mostly white neighborhood of Bensonhurst to look at a used
car. A mob of whites allegedly mistook them for friends of
Feliciano.
   The defense charged during the trial that Feliciano incited the
killing by telling Mondello that a group of her black and Hispanic
friends were coming to the neighborhood to fight.
   Fama was convicted of murder and other charges last week.
Mondello was acquitted on murder and manslaughter charges but found
guilty of riot, assault, menacing, harassment and weapons
possession.
   Pat Clark, a spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Charles
Hynes, said Feliciano's arrest would not deter prosecutors from
seeking her testimony in upcoming trials of six defendants yet to
be tried.
   O'Leary said Feliciano was charged with criminal possession of a
controlled substance, criminal possession of drug paraphernalia and
theft of services. The drug charge carries a prison term of one to
seven years upon conviction.

   Ivan F. Boesky's credibility as prosecution star
witness in a securities fraud trial took another blistering assault
today from a defense lawyer seeking to portray him as a
money-grubber who might have cheated on his taxes.
   Separately, it was disclosed that Boesky took a $50 million tax
deduction in 1986, accounting for half of the $100 million he paid
the government to settle its criminal insider trading case against
him.
   Boesky, on the stand for a third day in the trial of former
friend John A. Mulheren Jr., seemed more comfortable facing the
aggressive questioning of defense attorney Thomas P. Puccio after
reacting with testy indignation to Wednesday's cross-examination.
   The trial is the first time Boesky, Wall Street's most famous
felon, has testified publicly about his own crimes and the alleged
offenses of others he has implicated in a web of financial market
corruption in the 1980s.
   Puccio unsuccessfully sought to make Boesky admit that he was
terrified of losing his fortune and had transferred vast amounts of
money under his wife's name before he settled charges with the
government.
   Boesky, who surrendered $100 million in penalties and fines,
faces numerous civil lawsuits and spent two years in a federal
prison, long has claimed his legal ordeal has nearly bankrupted him.
   ``You're the kind of man who was concerned about how much money
you had or didn't have?,'' Puccio asked. Boesky replied: ``Less
than you might think. It has far less, far less consequence than
you might think.''
   Puccio also asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum
for permission to see Boesky's 1987 federal tax return, saying he
wanted to determine if Boesky took an illegal deduction on the $100
million.
   At a later conference with attorneys in the judge's chambers,
Boesky attorney Charles Davidow said Boesky had deducted $50
million of his $100 million penalty on his 1986 personal income tax
statement. Davidow said he did not know whether the deduction was
legal, but he assumed Boesky's tax attorneys or accountants had
reviewed it at the time.
   The judge granted Puccio's request. However, she said she would
allow defense attorneys to discuss the deduction during
cross-examination only in attempting to show that the penalty
against Boesky was not as painful or expensive as it appeared.
   On Wednesday, Boesky admitted under a heated cross-examination
that he had lied under oath repeatedly in the past.
   ``I regret that I lied. I did not like lying at the time, nor
did I like the time when I represented false statements about your
client,'' Boesky told Puccio.
   Mulheren faces 41 counts of securities fraud and other charges
for allegedly helping Boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federal
securities laws.
   Boesky fingered Mulheren in a 1986 plea bargain under which he
paid $100 million in penalties and served two years of a three-year
prison sentence to settle the largest insider trading case ever.

<HEAD>Poll: Most West Germans Worry Unity Occurring Too Fast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most West Germans favor slowing down
German unification and do not want joint German elections this
year, according to a poll published Thursday.
   And law enforcement officials said in reports published Thursday
the price of German unity might be an outbreak of terrorism in East
Germany by West German terrorists who oppose the spread of
capitalism.
   The survey in the news magazine Stern also said an overwhelming
majority _77 percent _ of those questioned said the terms of full
unification should be decided in an all-German referendum, not by
the two German parliaments.
   The results indicated clear disagreement with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's reunification ideas. Kohl supports quick reunification, has
expressed support for joint elections this year, and wants the
parliaments to decide on unity.
   Stern did not say how many people it queried or give a margin of
error for the poll.
   It said 60 percent of West Germans think unification is
occurring too quickly, and 65 percent believe this year is too
early for all-German elections.
   It is still unclear when a full political union will occur,
although the economies of West and East Germany are to become one
July 2.
   Most West Germans support unification, as do their eastern
neighbors, but many have grown nervous about Kohl's rush to unite
the states. They worry that hasty unification will jeopardize their
hard-earned affluence, since East Germany will be heavily reliant
on West German financial aid.
   Law enforcement officials told two Bonn newspapers that East
German politicians and West German businessmen could become targets
of leftist terrorists.
   The General Anzeiger newspaper quoted West German terrorist
tracker Juergen Hessel as saying of East Germany: ``Those who have
thrust themselves into the consciousness of the public there are
endangered.''
   Hessel is head of the anti-terrorist unit of the Federal
Criminal Office, West Germany's equivalent of the FBI.
   Of special concern is the notorious Red Army Faction,
responsible for dozens of attacks on politicians, businessmen and
military installations in West Germany since the early 1970s.
   Hessel told the paper that Red Army Faction terrorists are
thought to have already set up hiding places in East Germany and
established links with East German militants.
   Another Bonn newspaper, the Rundschau, said security in East
Germany is weak at the moment because the law-enforcement system
there is being revamped. In addition, East Germans are
inexperienced at dealing with terrorism, which never took root
under 40 years of repressive Communist rule.
   Hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker was ousted in last
fall's peaceful uprising, which paved the way for the nation's

<HEAD>Soviets Use Leftover Fine to Pay Latest Fishing Violation</HEAD>

   The owner of a seized Soviet fishing
vessel has agreed to pay $325,000 to settle a forfeiture case
alleging illegal fishing, the U.S. attorney's office said.
   The incident April 26 was at least the second time since 1989
that a Soviet fishing vessel was seized and fined for fishing in
North Pacific waters designated as an exclusive U.S. zone.
   Fines are levied based on the nature and gravity of the charge,
as well as whether the vessel is a repeat offender, assistant U.S.
attorney Tim Burgess said Wednesday.
   Considering those factors, Burgess said, the Soviet fine was
average.
   The factory trawler Ilya Ilyin, owned by a Soviet fishing
cooperative, was seized after the Coast Guard observed the ship
with its nets in the water within the U.S. fishing zone, northwest
of the Pribilof Islands.
   The vessel led the Coast Guard cutter Yocona on a chase before
stopping in international waters, where it was boarded, authorities
said.
   The ship was escorted to Kodiak Island. Its 84 crew members
remained aboard the vessel while it was in U.S. possession. It was
released Friday.
   Anchorage attorney Michael White, who represented the ship's
owner, said it agreed to the fine but maintains the illegal fishing
was inadvertent. White said the vessel was just 1,000 yards within
the U.S. zone.
   The fine is payable to the U.S. treasury within 60 days, which
White said was manageable even though banks may not make loans to
the Soviets and the Soviet ruble is not a convertible currency.
   The Soviets made a $75,000 down payment toward the fine by
applying funds left over from an earlier fine levied against a
Soviet vessel seized last year for illegal fishing, White said.
   Foreign and U.S. fleets have clashed for years over the
lucrative northern Pacific fisheries. In recent years, the
government has seized vessels from Canada, Taiwan and Japan, but
Soviet vessels are more rare.
   U.S. authority stems from the 1976 Magnuson Act which
established the nation's 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.

<HEAD>London's Strategic Studies Think Tank Calls Warsaw Pact Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-led Warsaw Pact is dead as a military
alliance and will probably fall apart when East Germany leaves it,
the International Institute for Strategic Studies said Thursday.
   The West's main dilemma in the 1990s will be how far to get
involved in the ``messy aftermath,'' the London research center
said in its annual Strategic Survey, released Thursday.
   Even without a clear threat from the East, the 16-nation NATO
alliance could serve as ``an insurance policy'' for a future
undivided Europe, but its role needs a complete redefinition, the
survey said.
   ``In early 1989 ... the key question had been `Whither NATO?'''
it said. ``A year later that question remains valid. ... But a
second question, `Whether NATO?,' lies not far below the surface.''
   The survey said the Soviet Union ``appears to be sliding toward
chaos, and how long, and how much of it will remain together are
very much open questions.''
   At a news conference, IISS Director Francois Heisbourg said
there was no possibility the seven-nation Warsaw Pact ``could act
as a single organization in warlike circumstances'' where it was
the aggressor.
   ``But NATO as an insurance policy is indispensable to the extent
that the countries of Western Europe and the United States consider
they have in common a number of interests alongside a number of
values,'' said Heisbourg.
   In the past year, most of the Soviet Union's erstwhile allies in
Eastern Europe have overthrown Communist governments, and
Czechoslovakia and Hungary are pressing Soviet troops to get out
fast.
   Heisbourg suggested that Western countries could subsidize the
return of more than 500,000 Soviet troops stationed outside the
Soviet Union.
   The largest Soviet deployment _ 380,000 soldiers _ is in East
Germany.
   He said it would take at least two years to withdraw Soviet
troops from East Germany if a crash housing program started now for
the returning soldiers.
   ``How Western states marry their desire to see progress in
Eastern Europe with an equally potent concern not to get entangled
in the messy aftermath of Soviet decolonization in Europe will be
one of the principle dilemmas of the 1990s,'' said the survey.
   Heisbourg said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was still
trying both to keep up reforms and to stop the secession of
republics such as Lithuania, but would soon have to choose one
policy or the other.
   He predicted the Soviet empire would fall apart, but gave no
timetable.
   ``There is no example of a multinational empire grouped together
in circumstances which are not considered legitimate by all the
people surviving ... whether you are talking about the Ottoman
Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   On other regions, the survey said:
   _Middle East: Egypt has supplanted Syria as the preeminent power
in the Arab world, gaining status from attempts to mediate peace
between Israel and the PLO. Syria weakened its position by trying
to achieve strategic party with Israel. ``In the 1990s it is
Egypt's capacity to moderate and mediate between the Arab states
and outsiders, as well as between the insecure Arab governments
themselves, which will be put to the test.''
   _South Africa: The reform process begun by President F.W. de
Klerk is ``irreversible,'' and both black and white leaders are
under pressure to compromise to reach a quick agreement. ``It is a
high-risk venture which could easily be derailed by radical
elements in both black and white ranks.''
   _ East Asia: North Korea's military preparations ``belie the
claim that it no longer represents a threat to the south.'' There
are reports North Korea is stocking up on chemical weapons and
building a nuclear weapon.
   _ Afghanistan: A military stalemate between President
Najibullah's pro-Soviet administration and Moslem guerrillas offers
no prospect of a settlement. ``The alternative _ a revision to a
loosely linked agglomeration of semi-feudal fiefdoms, with no writ
running countrywide _ appears no less possible and might be as
durable.''
   _ Nicaragua and Cuba: The Sandinista government's acceptance of
electoral defeat in Nicaragua is an encouraging sign, but huge
problems remain throughout the region. Despite Communist President
Fidel Castro's ``bluster,'' doubts are growing about the Cuban
leader's ability to stay in power.

<HEAD>Alyeska to Spend $230 Million This Year on Corrosion, Oil-Spill
Prevention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. plans to
nearly triple its work force this summer and spend an extra $230
million repairing pipeline corrosion and preventing oil-spill
damage, company officials say.
   ``This is our busiest summer since construction of the
pipeline,'' Alyeska spokeswoman Marnie Isaacs said Wednesday. The
company runs the trans-Alaska pipeline for the seven major oil
companies that own it.
   About $150 million of Alyeska's $450 million field budget this
year will be spent to repair or replace sections of corroded pipe
in the 800-mile line, which provides one-fourth of U.S. oil
production.
   Corrosion occurs most often in pipes that have little or no oil
flowing through them, allowing water to settle in the pipe and
start rusting it, Alyeska officials said.
   Alyeska has found more than 800 ``anomalies'' where corrosion
could have occurred in the pipeline, engineering and projects vice
president Ivan Henman said. It has investigated and begun repairs
on about half of those, he said.
   The company anticipates spending as much as $800 million to
repair the corroded pipe over several years, and officials
predicted their budget would be even larger next year.
   State officials have said the total repair bill could be $1.5
billion.
   Oil spill-related improvements will account for another $80
million this year, said Henman, one-quarter of that on measures to
protect fisheries in Prince William Sound.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done and
it's the responsible thing to do. I'm encouraged that Alyeska's
doing it,'' Dan Lawn of the state Department of Environmental
Conservation said from Valdez.
   On June 12, the entire pipeline will be shut down for 12 hours
for intensive inspection and repairs. Alyeska expects to employ
about 1,700 people during that stint.
   The 12-hour shutdown will mean as many as 900,000 barrels of oil
won't be shipped, according to state petroleum economist Dudley
Platt.
   In all, he said, the state expects about 25 million barrels of
oil won't be shipped over a three-month period this summer because
of repairs by Alyeska and by British Petroleum and ARCO Alaska Inc.
at Prudhoe Bay.

<HEAD>Labor Unveils New Moderate Policy: Troubled Tories Fight Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party, which holds a
commanding lead over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in opinion
polls, unveiled a new, moderate platform Thursday that marked the
climax of a major policy shift.
   The 20,000-word document incorporated most of Mrs. Thatcher's
stringent curbs on labor unions, envisaged private investment in
state enterprises, and imposed an income tax ceiling of 50 percent.
Under the last Labor Party government in 1979, the top income tax
was 83 percent.
   On defense, the socialist party promised large, but unspecified,
cuts in spending, and said money saved would be diverted to social
programs. The party had already ditched its vote-losing policy of
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   ``Some of the people who have been socialists have been
profoundly wrong,'' said Labor leader Neil Kinnock. ``We are
convinced democratic socialists.''
   Until the mid-1980s, Labor wanted to withdraw Britain from the
12-nation European Community. It took a pro-Europe stance in the
new platform.
   The policy statement, ``Looking To The Future,'' said a Labor
government will negotiate British entry into the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links most
currencies of the 12 EC nations.
   The Conservative Party dismissed the policy document as a public
relations exercise and said the reality of a Labor government would
be high taxes and unions out of control.
   Kinnock, a 48-year-old Welshman, has pushed Labor toward the
center, particularly since the party's third successive election
defeat by Mrs. Thatcher in 1987.
   The party lost power amid anti-union sentiment provoked by
nationwide strikes and soaring prices. It lurched to the left in
the early 1980s, when Mrs. Thatcher set about her free-market
revolution.
   But Mrs. Thatcher is now in trouble over the economy. Inflation
is heading toward 10 percent, and there is an uproar over a new
local tax system.
   Labor has led in opinion polls for more than a year, sometimes
by as much as 20 points, and hammered the Conservatives in local
elections this month.
   Kinnock, who will automatically become prime minister if Labor
wins national elections, now regularly outstrips 64-year-old Mrs.
Thatcher in personal popularity ratings.
   The next election does not have to be held until mid-1992. There
is speculation, however, Mrs. Thatcher may call one in March 1991
if her policy of using high interest rates to squeeze inflation is
working by then.
   Britain traditionally has short, four-week general election
campaigns.
   But both major parties have already started what amounts to
election campaigning.
   Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker on Wednesday launched
what he called a ``summer blitz'' on Labor, with election-style
gimmicks. Its emblem is a spoof showing Labor's red-rose emblem
wilting.
   ``They are ahead in the polls,' Baker said of Labor on Thursday.
``I can't just avert my eyes from this unseemly sight. I must
attack.''
   On union laws, Labor said it will ease restrictions on sympathy
strikes, but leave in place key curbs such as forcing secret
ballots before strikes. The socialist party receives financial
support from the unions.
   Labor avoided putting a price on its program. Party leaders also
would not say at what level higher tax rates will apply.
   The Conservatives say Labor would increase taxes, impose
punitive tax rates on the wealthy and push up inflation trying to
finance more state benefits.
   Since taking office, Mrs. Thatcher has slashed income tax to
flat rates of 25 percent or 40 percent. But the sales tax is 15
percent on most items and Labor argues the overall tax burden on
the poorest has increased.
   Among other issues, the new document dropped Labor pledges to
reverse with minimum compensation Mrs. Thatcher's sales of state
enterprises, ranging from British Airways to the national telephone
network.
   The policy document pledged only to return to state ownership
the latest sold utility, the water supply network.

   Rebel forces in Liberia have assumed control
of a coastal city and there are fears a recent wave of human rights
abuses may reach the capital city of Monrovia, the State Department
said Thursday.
   ``We call on officials entrusted with the law to vigorously
pursue the perpetrators of these heinous crimes and to bring them
to justice under the rule of law,'' spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said.
   She said the city of Buchanan, 60 miles southeast of Monrovia,
fell into the hands of rebel forces over the weekend. The
insurgents are attempting to oust the 10-year old government of
President Samuel K. Doe.
   Ms. Tutwiler issued an appeal to all Liberians ``to end the
ethnically-related violence that has placed Monrovians in the grip
of fear.''
   The fighting has displaced an estimated 250,000 Liberians from
their homes. Many have fled to neighboring Guinea and the Ivory
Coast.

   Charles Wiltse, a historian who was
considered a leading biographical expert on 19th century America,
has died at the age of 83.
   Wiltse died Tuesday at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic after
suffering a heart attack, said John Wilson of Rand-Wilson Funeral
Home.
   Wiltse edited the papers of Daniel Webster, the prominent
congressman and secretary of state, in a 16-volume work completed
last year. He also was an expert on one of Webster's
contemporaries, statesman and Vice President John Calhoun. In the
1940s he prepared a three-volume set on Calhoun's papers.
   He was the author of ``The Jeffersonian Tradition in American
Democracy'' and ``The New Nation 1800-1845,'' as well as many
articles on the history of the period.
   He was a professor of history at Dartmouth College from 1966 to
1972, before retiring from teaching.
   Wiltse was born in San Francisco, and was a 1929 graduate of
West Virginia University. He earned a Ph.D. at Cornell University
in 1932.
   He is survived by a sister, Clara Wiltse of Muncie, Ind. His
wife died in 1985.

   The only girl among 10 finalists became the
second National Geography Bee champion Thursday when she correctly
named Antarctica as the continent where the Mount Erebus volcano is
located.
   Susannah Batko-Yovino, a diminutive 11-year-old sixth-grader
from the Washington-Jefferson School in Altoona, Pa., won a $25,000
college scholarship.
   Susannah defeated 13-year-old Tim Forest, an eighth-grader at
C.J. Hooker Middle School in Goshen, N.Y. Tim received a $15,000
scholarship for his second place win.
   Martin Hohner, a 14-year-old eighth-grader at Luther Burbank
School in Chicago, placed third, winning a $10,000 scholarship.
Each of the other finalists receive $500.
   The winners' scholarship money will be placed in
interest-bearing accounts until they enroll in college.
   More than 3 million students nationwide have taken part in the
various levels of competition. Fifty-seven contestants, age 11 to
14, represented all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five
territories and the Department of Defense schools in the semifinals
here Wednesday.
   The contest was developed to stimulate children's interest in
geography, said Gilbert Grosvenor, president and chairman of the
National Geographic Society, which organized the event.
   The initiative was launched after an international Gallup Poll
commissioned by the society in 1988 showed American adults and
students seriously lacking in their knowledge of geography. In the
10-country survey, Americans ranked among the bottom third and
those age 18 to 24 came in last.
   Alex Trebek, host of the long-running television quiz show
``Jeopardy'' moderated the finals, using maps and slides to
question the students on a wide range of subjects.
   The subjects included the ceremonial event celebrated by Indians
in the Pacific Northwest characterized by a feast and lavish
gift-giving (potlatch) to the identity of individual republics in
the Soviet Union from a numbered political map.
   Susannah said she read a lot and used two geography games,
``Where in the World?'' and ``Global Pursuit'' to prepare.
   ``This is the best thing that's ever happened to me,'' she said
after her win.
   It felt ``wonderful, great and terrific'' being the winner,
Susannah said, adding that it didn't really matter that she beat so
many boys.
   ``This is only the second year and I hope there's going to be a
lot more girls winning,'' she said.
   Last year's winner was 15-year-old Jack Staddon, one of six
students who attended a church school in Great Bend, Kan.
   Susannah, who had answered all questions correctly in
Wednesday's preliminary rounds, continued that pattern until the
first question of the championship round between her and Tim.
   ``What name was given to the ancient, overland trade routes that
linked the Mediterranean World with China?,'' Trebek said.
   She said the Oriental Route, and he answered the Overland Trail.
The correct answer was the Silk Route. Other acceptable answers
would have been the Silk Road, Jade Road, Fur Road or Emperor's
Road.
   Tim added to the suspense of the competition, often responding
after long pauses and asking Trebek to repeat most of the questions.
   ``I've learned not to take your quizzical, uncertain look
seriously, Tim,'' Trebek said at one point in the second
tie-breaker round. ``Every time you appear that way you come up
with the right response.''
   But Susannah and Tim they both missed that question: ``The
terrorist activities of members of the Mau Mau played an important
role in the movement for independence of what present-day African
country?''
   The correct response is Kenya.
   The other finalists were:
   _Sacha Arnold, 13, an eighth-grader at Lewis F. Cole Middle
School in Fort Lee, N.J.
   _Kevin David, 13, an eighth-grader at Webb School in Knoxville,
Tenn. Kevin is one of six students who participated in the
preliminary rounds for the second time. Last year he didn't make
the finals.
   _Gary Yngve, 11, who's in the sixth grade at Dodgen Middle
School in Marietta, Ga.
   _Burt Vossen, 11, a sixth-grader at St. Anne's School in San
Francisco.
   _Chris Duncan, 13, an eighth-grader at Alconbury High School on
a U.S. military base in England.
   _Mike Clark, 14, one of five eighth graders at Palisades Seventh
Day Adventist School in Great Falls, Mont.
   _Barry Craig Dean, 12, in the eighth grade at Krueger Junior
High School in Michigan City, Ind.

   A woman described by police as the
high priestess of a devil-worship cult has been arrested on charges
she agreed to help kill a person.
   Linda Barszcz, 34, and her cult recruited juveniles, stole
religious objects, and, in the end, offering to help an undercover
investigator kill a fictitious person for $20,000, police said
Wednesday.
   Investigator Robert William Vernon was assigned to infiltrate
the group. Vernon began by studying a satanic bible and writing
letters to Linda Barszcz, who moved to Florida from Massachusetts
about six years ago, police said.
   Police said Barszcz and a follower, Julian Samaniego, offered to
set up a meeting with a killer to help Vernon kill someone. Police
said the two qnext door

   The Barszczs' friends and family members, who came to the
apartment late Wednesday, denied the allegations of
devil-worshiping and murder conspiracies.
   ``She practices her own religion, with many gods,
mythological,'' said Doug Moore, 19, the only member of the group
who would allow his name to be used. ``It's not satanist.''

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov warned his countrymen
Thursday of the ``painful processes'' needed to rescue their
stagnant economy, but he said there was no choice but to abandon
central planning and adopt a market system.
   Ryzhkov himself owned up to the catastrophic state of the
economy and faced a barrage of criticism that climaxed with demands
for his government to resign. His two-hour address to the Supreme
Soviet parliament was nationally televised.
   He said there would be price hikes and unemployment _ possibly
in the tens of millions _ but ``our decision is made. We have to
move to the market.''
   Ryzhkov presented the program as a compromise between
Polish-style ``shock therapy,'' which tries to keep the transition
to a market economy short by taking more radical measures
immediately, and appeals to return to the old-style centrally
planned Soviet economy.
   His vehement rejection of the Polish model led deputy Vitold
Fokin to comment from the podium: ``They've ruled out shock
therapy, but now they're recommending an operation without
anesthesia.''
   Immediately after Ryzhkov's speech, several dozen opposition
lawmakers voted to demand a motion of no-confidence in his
government.
   ``The government is not proposing a market, only a price hike,''
said Alexei Levashov, a lawmaker from Leningrad.
   Galina Starovoitova, another deputy, warned that the angry,
hungry populace might take to the streets when bread prices triple
on July 1, the first step of the proposed reform. Bread is the
staple of the Soviet diet and is extremely cheap, about 32 cents a
loaf.
   On the parliament's floor, radical economist Gennady Filshin
demanded the government resign because he said it had lost the
people's trust and therefore lacked the authority to carry out the
needed reforms.
   Ryzhkov said the plan, which provides financial aid to
compensate consumers for most of the price rises, would be
presented for ``nationwide discussion.'' He did not mention a
formal referendum, which other government officials have predicted.
   Ryzhkov's proposal brought objections. ``To turn this into a
poll or referendum is like asking me: `Do you want me to give you
an enema?''' said deputy Yuri Chernichenko. ``Of course I'll say
no.''
   Ryzhkov admitted the Soviet people would find it ``very
difficult to accept the proposal that has been put forward.''
   ``The government's task is to explain, to convince people this
is the road we have to take,'' he told reporters.
   The premier, a tall, former factory director whose voice
sometimes trembles when he speaks in public, dismissed the efforts
to unseat him.
   ``It's a political game, no more,'' he said.
   Members of the opposition Inter-Regional Deputies Group, which
claims about 70 of the Supreme Soviet's 542 deputies, said they
knew the no-confidence vote would fail and might not even have
enough support to get onto the agenda. But they said they believed
they had to make the gesture.
   It is not expected to come up for a vote until discussion of the
government project is complete. The discussion will continue Friday.
   Ryzhkov told parliament the economic transition should be made
in three stages. Starting Jan. 1 average food prices will double,
with meat prices rising 2.3 times and fish prices 2.5 times, he
said. Food prices now are heavily subsidized.
   The first stage also would require parliament, the Council of
Ministers that Ryzhkov heads, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
approve laws and decrees establishing a market-style credit and
banking system.
   Ryzhkov promised that the government would compensate people,
especially low-income families, to help them survive price
increases. But he said there would be no compensation for luxuries
such as jewelry, liquor, tobacco and delicacies.
   He also promised to provide for the millions of people who could
be thrown out of work by the reforms.
   He told lawmakers the second stage of the plan, during 1991 and
1992, would involve price reform, a new taxation system and bank
interest rates far higher than the 2 percent now charged and paid
by banks.
   ``We need a really tough financing and credit policy that should
become a tool for the government to regulate economic life and
prevent inflation,'' he said.
   The second stage also calls for transferring 60 percent of state
enterprise to joint-stock ownership for eventual sale to private
individuals and companies, or to workers.
   The third stage, actual transfer of ownership and a sharp
reduction of central control, should occur in 1993-95, the period
of ``demonopolizing the economy,'' he said.
   Computer studies show that moving to a market economy ``will
lead to a sharp drop in investment and the curtailment of
production in heavy industries,'' the state news agency Tass
reported. That is expected to entail bankruptcy for inefficient
factories and businesses.

<HEAD>Rioters Seize Hostages, Set Fires; France Sends Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>

   Anti-government protesters rioted in
Gabon's two biggest cities Thursday, burning public buildings and
property belonging to President Omar Bongo and aides, witnesses
said. France sent troops to protect its citizens.
   The rioters, angered at the death of an opposition leader
Wednesday, blocked the airport runway in Port Gentil and took 10
oil executives hostage. All were released Thursday.
   Protesters accused Bongo's government of killing Joseph
Rendjambe, secretary-general of the moderate Gabon Progress Party,
and demanded that government troops leave Port Gentil, Gabon's
second-largest city.
   In Libreville, the capital, groups of demonstrators
systematically attacked and burned public buildings and property
belonging to Bongo and his close associates, witnesses said.
   The protests began Wednesday and prompted Bongo to call out army
troops and impose a curfew. But few soldiers or police were in
sight Thursday as groups of up to 100 protesters rampaged in
Libreville, witnesses said. The only visible force was the
Presidential Guard stationed around Bongo's presidential palace.
   Some protesters demanded France intervene to help remove Bongo,
who has ruled Gabon since 1967.
   Bongo, a civilian, has never been considered as violent or
repressive as some other African dictators. But his popularity
plunged after falling oil prices and excessive government spending
forced the imposition of economic austerity measures.
   After months of rallies for democratic reforms, he announced
Monday he was ending 22 years of one-party rule.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry announced it was sending
an unspecified number of reinforcements into the former French
colony to bolster its 500-member force. Military sources in France
said 150 legionnaires from a parachute regiment left for Gabon on
Thursday afternoon.
   French soldiers, apparently from the existing force, had taken
up positions in Port Gentil, about 100 miles southeast of
Libreville, in the late afternoon.
   Eight French oil executives were among the 10 held hostage in
Port Gentil, and a French Consulate there was burned Wednesday. One
of the hostages, Roland Toulouse, a French national reponsible for
public relations for Shell Gabon, phoned Libreville to report all
had been freed and none was harmed.
   Rendjambe supported a parliamentary democracy and was considered
one of the more moderate opposition leaders. He was found dead in a
hotel room Wednesday with what appeared to be needle marks on his
abdomen. Cause of death was not immediately known.
   Following news of the death, several hundred protesters in
Libreville tried to march to the presidential palace but were
turned back. Some set fire to the hotel where Rendjambe's body was
found, and to a neighboring movie theater.
   Bongo was vice president in 1967 and became president after the
elected president died. He declared a one-party state in this
oil-producing country in 1968 and has been re-elected unopposed
four times, most recently in November 1986.
   National elections are scheduled for September.

   A widening wildcat strike by railroad
workers cut off the nation's busiest port Thursday, but the
Solidarity-led government refused to grant pay raises demanded by
the strikers.
   It was the most serious challenge yet to Poland's economic shock
program, and government officials said giving in even once to
workers' demands could scuttle the reforms.
   The government fired the Communist-appointed director of the
Pomerania rail region along the Baltic coast just before opening
negotiations with labor representatives. The government refuses to
talk directly with the strikers.
   Negotiations broke off after six hours because three of the
unions insisted the talks be moved to Slupsk, where the renegade
strike committee is based, the official PAP news agency said.
   The unions do not represent the strikers, but the government had
invited a delegation from the strike committee to the Warsaw talks.
The delegation never arrived, and the strikers demanded the talks
be moved.
   Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said officials were
unsure whether they would go to Slupsk.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki appealed Thursday for an end
to the strike.
   ``Today we have other means of claiming one's rights in a state
that is democratic and no longer totalitarian,'' he told a local
election rally in the central city of Kalisz. ``We must understand
each other and what is good for Poland: paralyzing transport or
crossing together the stormy river of economic change?''
   The labor unrest, including hunger strikes by 50 workers, has
produced a ``full blockade'' of rail traffic in northwest Poland,
cutting off the country's busiest port in Szczecin, railroad
spokesman Jacek Wnukowski said.
   The five-day strike spread to the rail station at the Gydnia
port near Gdansk, the official PAP news agency said.
   In all, about a dozen key railroad junctures and a locomotive
repair shop were idled, and traffic from the industrial south was
disrupted. The army was moving perishable goods and essential
supplies.
   It was not immediately known how many of the state-owned
railroad's 400,000 employees were on strike.
   In addition to seeking pay raises of about $8 above the national
average of $79 monthly, the strikers are seeking the dismissal of
railroad directors installed by the former Communist regime. The
contend the old guard is incompetent and hampering reforms.
   Solidarity's leadership has called the strike a ``strong
warning'' that the government it helped create must speed reforms.
But the leadership urged the workers to resolve the strike.
   Leader Lech Walesa said the strikers' anger is legitimate but
their actions are too drastic when ``our democracy is young and
weak.'' He postponed his Friday departure on an eight-day trip to
Scandinavia because of the unrest.
   The Solidarity chapter repesenting Gydnia port employees urged
the strikers to return to their jobs, saying their action is ``a
way of blackmail and limits the possibilities for negotiations.''
   The government warned that the unrest could jeopardize efforts
to convince Western investors that post-Communist Poland is
politically stable.
   ``The government's stance is firm,'' Editor-in-Chief Dariusz
Fikus wrote in the government daily Rzeczpospolita. ``By entering
negotiations with the strikers, who do not represent any organized
force, the government would throw the door wide open to unending
pay claims.''
   Poland's drive to create a market-driven economy has cut
government subsidies to state-run enterprises and barred pay raises
that cannot be supported by the companies. The government has vowed
to make no exceptions to the reform program implemented Jan. 1.
   The strict wage controls, coupled with the raising of prices to
market levels after years at unrealistically low rates based on
government subsidies, has reduced Poles' real incomes by an
estimated 40 percent.

<HEAD>Five Companies To Work Together On Research Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA and the Defense Department announced
Thursday they have approved a unique plan by five aerospace
companies to put aside rivalries and work on the National
Aero-Space Plane as a team.
   The aerospace plane, to be known as the X-30, will be a research
vehicle capable of flying up to 25 times the speed of sound. It is
to be built primarily to develop technologies that will be used on
planes of the future.
   A priority goal for the X-30 is to fly directly into orbit from
a conventional runway and return, unlike the space shuttle which
requires a booster rocket and an expendable fuel tank for
launching. It is also to be capable of long range hypersonic travel
within the atmosphere.
   The five contractors had agreed in January to end competition
for developing the plane and modify their fixed-price contracts
with the government to reflect the team concept. The announcement
Thursday was the government's acceptance of the plan.
   The five companies are General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas,
Rockwell International, Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division and Pratt &amp;
Whitney. They are to be known as the National Contractor Team.
   ``The federal government is taking a unique step in bringing
together a single team of experts to examine the technical
applications of hypersonic flight,'' said the joint announcement by
NASA and DOD.
   Antitrust issues raised by the teaming are not expected to be a
problem since the X-30 is not a commercial product and not for
profit.
   ``The benefits of teaming include eliminating duplication of
efforts,'' said J.R. Thompson, deputy administrator of NASA in
congressional testimony earlier this year.
   ``The contractors are able to remain open to the benefits of
technology spinoffs and still be genuine competitors on future
NASP-derived concepts. NASP is probably the ideal program for such
a bold contractual approach because of the challenge of the vehicle
and the fact that each contractor has excellent ideas, concepts and
expertise.''
   In their agreement in January, the five contractors designated
Rockwell International as the lead contractor and said Barry J.
Waldman, formerly vice president and program manager of
Rocketdyne's NASP efforts, as program director.
   Only Wednesday, the French aircraft builder Aerospatiale
announced an agreement to set up ``an international study group''
to look into the feasibility of building a successor to the aging
supersonic Concorde.
   It said the American firms Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, along
with the Germain Air Bus, will cooperate with Aerospatiale and
British Aerospace in a study for a Concorde replacement.
   Aerospatiale has said if the study finds a new supersonic model
is feasible, a faster, larger and longer range plane than the
Concorde could be in the air by the year 2005.

<HEAD>Impact of Clean Air Bill Will Be Widespread</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By all accounts, pollution controls in new
clean air legislation would have a wide impact, from the cost of a
car to whether the corner dry cleaner stays open.
   ``Everybody is going to find out that clean air is not free,''
said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., after he and other House members
overwhelmingly approved a far-reaching clean air bill late
Wednesday.
   Dingell, along with Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., was at the
center of lengthy negotiations that resolved more than a decade of
disputes over tougher clean air provisions. The Senate also has
crafted a compromise bill agreeable to most members and supported
by the White House.
   The Senate's approval of a bill April 3 and the House action
this week marked the first time in 13 years that either body had
agreed to even consider on the floor changes in federal air
pollution laws.
   The Senate and House bills must now be brought in line with each
other before legislation goes to President Bush for his signature.
The two bills share generally broad outlines for attaining cleaner
air by cutting acid rain pollutants in half, requiring sharp
reductions in smog-causing pollutants from automobiles and
demanding that industry control its releases of toxic chemicals.
   But in all of these areas the timetables differ slightly. At
times the requirements favor one industry or segment of an industry
over another or benefit one region of the country over another.
   Clean air legislation has been such a thorny issue in Congress
because so many diverse and at times competing constituencies are
affected. While a section of the legislation eases the acid rain
problem for the Northeast, for example, it also poses hardships to
the Midwest where utilities and their customers will have to pay
for pollution controls.
   The White House has been determined to keep the costs of the
legislation down and limit its impact on economic growth. Even so,
Bush administration officials estimate the new bill will cost the
economy $21.5 billion a year when all its requirements are
implemented.
   Industry says the cost will be much higher and that some sectors
of the economy _ such as steel _ might be forced to close plants.
More than 5,000 high-sulfur coal miners are expected to lose their
jobs because tougher acid rain controls and will force some
utilities to shift to a cleaner burning fuel.
   The White House is expected to push for deletion of a job-loss
assistance provision that was included in the House version, but is
not in the Senate bill. The administration calls the $250 million
program over five years too expensive.
   Oil industry lobbyists have vowed through their friends in
Congress to continue a push to soften requirements for the sale of
a cleaner gasoline blend _ with an oxygen content the oil companies
say will require a grain-based ethanol additive _ in nine badly
polluted cities.
   And the automakers don't plan to give up trying to get out of
the bills a proposal _ though significantly scaled back _ that
requires them to produce and sell up to 300,000 alternative fuel
vehicles by the end of the decade.
   Lobbying has been intense, largely because of the impact the
legislation will have on everyone from the operators of chemicals
plants to the purchaser of a new car.
   Tougher emission control requirements for cars will require
automakers to design new equipment, which could increase the cost
of a car by as much as $500, according to industry estimates.
Environmentalists said the cost increase is inflated.
   Requirements for cleaner fuels in the most polluted urban areas
of the country are expected to raise the price of gasoline slightly.
   Under the House bill, some small businesses would have to
install new controls to combat smog in areas with the worst
pollution. The Senate version exempts polluters that emit less than
100 tons a year, but the House bill in some cases covers polluters
of one-tenth that amount.
   If the House prevails, some small businesses such as the corner
dry cleaner might be forced to close, suggest industry lobbyists.
   New controls for sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, will
force some Midwest utilities to increase rates significantly,
according to utility lobbyists. The EPA estimates the average
electric rate will increase no more than 3 percent, but the agency
concedes increases could be 15 percent or more for customers of
some utilities in the Midwest.

<HEAD>Pakistan's Leader Accuses India of Kashmir Genocide</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday accused India of waging ``genocide'' in secession-minded
Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect
attention.
   Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan,
which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir. The two
countries, which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965,
have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the
common border.
   ``India is indulging in genocide,'' Ms. Bhutto said at a news
conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight
Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
   ``Islamic scholars are being killed and innocent people are
being slaughtered. This is deplorable,'' said the prime minister.
   She was referring to the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad
Farooq, the top Moslem cleric in Indian Kashmir. During his funeral
procession Monday, Indian forces shot to death 58 people.
   Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran, Turkey,
Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a
high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's
stand on the Kashmir issue.
   Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training
Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's
only state with a Moslem majority. Pakistan, which is dominated by
Moslems, denies the Indian charge.
   Since the Indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants
in late January, more than 400 people have been killed.
   During her trip abroad, Ms. Bhutto said all her host countries
agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political
settlement of the 43-year-old dispute.
   However, she added, ``If subjected to aggression, we would have
the full support of the Arab Islamic nations. Pakistan, I was
assured, would never be left alone.''
   ``We believe the threats to peace are grave,'' she said. ``We
cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict, but we do not
believe war is inevitable,'' she told reporters.
   Ms. Bhutto said she opposes an independent Kashmir. She said it
was not envisioned when India and Pakistan gained independence in a
1947 partition.
   The prime minister again called for talks between Pakistan and
India. She also said a neutral body should look into the charges
made by both sides.
   India has already rejected both suggestions.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told the provisional president
of Haiti on Thursday that he hopes a date for elections in her
country will be announced soon.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot told Bush she had invited the
United Nations and the Organization of American States to monitor
elections in Haiti when they are held, a White House statement said.
   She later told reporters that only Haiti's election council,
composed of representatives from labor, human rights and business
groups, can determine a date for the balloting.
   Pascal-Trouillot, formerly a supreme court judge, has promised
to relinquish power to an elected government before the end of the
year.
   Bush promised her the United States would support Haiti's
transition to democracy with election aid, the White House said.
   The administration has asked Congress for $3 million to
underwrite Haiti's elections, but the request has been stalled by
congressional wrangling over a companion request for aid to
Nicaragua and Panama.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft took part in the first meeting between a
U.S. president and a civilian Haitian president since 1941.
   Pascal-Trouillot assumed her duties in mid-March, after Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to the
United States. Haiti has drifted from one political crisis to
another since the ouster of President Jean-Claude Duvalier in early
1986.
   Last week, the administration announced it would give Haiti $18
million to buy food. Bush also asked Congress for $10 million in
emergency aid to allow the government to buy gasoline and meet
other urgent needs.
   The United States, Canada and France, the three major donors of
aid to the impoverished island, suspended assistance to Haiti in
1988 to protest abuses by its military rulers and the lack of
democratic elections.
   Some U.S. aid continued to be funneled through private
organizations directly to needy Haitians, bypassing the government.

<HEAD>New York's Lincoln Center Tackles All of Mozart _ 835 Compositions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All of Mozart's 835 compositions will be
performed at Lincoln Center over 19 months to observe the 200th
anniversary next year of the composer's death.
   The plan to perform all the compositions is believed to be a
first, Lincoln Center officials said Wednesday in making the
announcement.
   The initial concert of the Mozart Bicentennial is Jan. 27, 1991,
said Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal.
   The opening concert will re-create a program that Mozart
conducted of his compositions on March 23, 1783, in Vienna. It has
143 minutes of music, compared with typical 70- to 90-minute
concerts today. Zubin Mehta will conduct members of the New York
Philharmonic and the Juilliard Orchestra.
   Vienna-born Erich Leinsdorf will conduct Mozart's ``Requiem'' on
Dec. 5, 1991, the 200th anniversary of the composer's death in
Vienna.
   F. Murray Abraham, who portrayed Mozart rival Antonio Salieri in
the movie ``Amadeus,'' suggested that a couple of Salieri's best
compositions be included in the programs and that audiences be
asked to guess which they were.
   ``I think 90 percent of the audience would not be able to tell
the difference,'' between Mozart and Salieri compositions the actor
said. ``I think Salieri has been much maligned in the film. He has
done me a great, great favor and I would like to return the
compliment.'' Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance.
   Bicentennial donors included the Samuels Foundation, nine
Japanese corporations, the E. Nakamichi Foundation, the National
Endowment for the Humanities and Alice Tully, said Lincoln Center
board chairman George Weissman. He said that approximately 10
concerts will be televised by PBS.
   ``In the regular concert repertory we only hear maybe a tenth of
what Mozart wrote. I think we are going to find he wrote wonderful
works at all periods in his life,'' said Neal Zaslaw, music
professor at Cornell University, who is advising the bicentennial.

   President George Bush says he has no ``burning
desire'' to station U.S. forces in Germany and elsewhere overseas,
a leading West German politician said on Thursday.
   Otto Graf Lambsdorff, chairman of the junior coalition partner
Free Democratic Party and former economics minister, said he told
Bush during a White House meeting on Thursday that his party
favored continued North American troop presence in a unified
Germany.
   ``He said he has no burning desire to have American troops
everywhere, and I told him perhaps we don't have a burning desire,
but there is a desire for quite some time for American troops,
certainly as long as we do have Soviet troops,'' Lambsdorff told a
reporter.
   West Germany is host to about 280,000 American soldiers, and
Bush has proposed cutting them to 195,000, but there is widespread
speculation the number would drop much more if an East-West
agreement can be reached on conventional forces.
   Lambsdorff said that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
``certainly will take time'' to remove forces from East Germany if
the two Germanys reach a unification agreement between themselves
and with the four victor nations of World War II -- Britain,
France, the Soviet Union and Britain.
   ``He cannot take 380,000 men plus family members back home from
one day to the next,'' he said. ``So we will have a transitional
period, and that has to be accepted.''

   A Soviet bomber caught fire and exploded over the
Crimean Peninsula seconds after the crew ejected, but the navigator
and a person on the ground were killed, the government daily
Izvestia reported Thursday.
   The victim on the ground was killed and five people were injured
by fragments from an oxygen tank in the wreckage of the TU-22M
plane that apparently exploded, the newspaper reported.
   The right engine of the TU-22M, which was carrying four people,
caught fire nine minutes after takeoff Monday night, Lt. Gen. V.
Budeyev told Izvestia. The plane then went out of control at an
altitude of about 9,000 feet, he said.
   The crew ejected over the village of Zuya, but the navigator
died because his parachute malfunctioned, Izvestia reported.
   The pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the village, and
it exploded about seven seconds after the crew escaped. The plane's
left engine also had caught fire.
   A group on the ground approached the wreckage about a mile from
the village, and six were injured by fragments of an oxygen tank
that apparently exploded, Izvestia said. One later died.
   The Izvestia report did not say where the plane had taken off or
where it was headed. The report said the plane was a
missile-carrying bomber, but it gave no other details.

<HEAD>Gramm Says Congress May Force More Anti-Drug Spending in Capital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm criticizing Mayor Marion
Barry's management of the city's drug and financial problems, said
Thursday he may try to force the District of Columbia to spend more
money on the police fight against crime.
   The threat of congressional intervention came in Barry's first
Capitol Hill appearance since his Jan. 18 arrest on cocaine charges.
   Police officials, burdened by a record murder rate for the last
two years, have recently said that overtime patrols in the city's
high-rent Georgetown area were threatened by funding shortages.
   ``I'm not into trying to play mayor ... but something is wrong
when people are being notified to stay out of Georgetown at night
because we don't have police officers,'' Gramm, R-Texas, told Barry.
   He said he may try to get other senators to approve a measure an
unprecedented measure to direct the city to spend a portion of its
$430.5 million federal payment on the police department. Congress
last year gave the city $31.7 million to fight drugs.
   City officials object to such intervention, but President Bush
reiterated Thursday his opposition to statehood for the district.
He said he hadn't considered a proposal to give the city
congressional representation without statehood.
   ``Hadn't really got it in mind. Interested in talking about
it,'' Bush said at a press conference. ``Have done nothing about it
at all except to continually restate my opposition, because this is
a federal city, to statehood for the District.''
   Barry, who is facing trial next month on cocaine possession,
conspiracy and perjury charges, said the city has boosted police
spending sharply to fight a crime problem that has drawn nationwide
attention.
   ``No one in this city is more concerned about public safety than
I am,'' said Barry. ``There's been some criticism lately that this
government is not committed to public safety. The facts of the
matter do not support ... any such conclusion.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee that oversees the district, told Barry the dispute over
anti-crime spending ``puts a cloud over'' the city's 1991 fiscal
year budget in Congress.
   ``I have concerns about other portions of the budget, but I
think Sen. Gramm speaks for a large number of our colleagues,''
Adams said. ``Until we get that straightened out, we can't get to
those other things _ this is a hurdle we can't overcome.''

   The Justice Department was pushing for tough
fines for corporations convicted of crimes three days before it
abruptly withdrew support for the plan, a U.S. sentencing
commissioner said Thursday.
   ``They were talking about tough guidelines and I heard them
out,'' George E. MacKinnon, a federal appellate judge and member of
the U.S. Sentencing Commission told a congressional hearing about
his March 13 meeting with Justice Department officials.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and other Democrats charged that the
abrupt reversal made it appear that ``business interests may have
pressured the White House and the Department of Justice to go soft
on the subject.''
   The meeting occurred three days before Deputy Attorney General
Donald B. Ayer wrote the commission to withdraw a Feb. 26 letter
expressing the agency's support for a new formula for imposing
fines and other penalties on companies, unions and other
organizations convicted of crimes.
   Ayer announced his resignation May 11, shortly after it was
disclosed that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had ordered him to
write the March 16 letter.
   Department officials say Thornburgh issued the order at the
request of the White House, which had received questions about the
proposed guidelines from business groups.
   Thornburgh ordered the Feb. 26 letter withdrawn because it
hadn't been cleared with him before it was sent, officials have
said.
   Paul L. Maloney, deputy assistant attorney general, told
lawmakers that the Justice Department was still committed to tough
guidelines, saying the Feb. 26 letter was withdrawn because ``the
attorney general wanted an opportunity to thoroughly review the
highly complex matter.''
   ``The review that is presently going on does not in any way
represent a repudiation of the department's position on the
proposed sentencing guidelines options,'' he said.
   Maloney said he didn't know about the White House call to
Thornburgh's office until he read about it in newspaper accounts
last month. A member of Thornburgh's staff confirmed the report of
the call, Maloney said.
   The commission intended to promulgate the guidelines by this
month but on April 10 tabled further action until three vacancies
on the seven-member panel are filled.
   Circuit Judge William W. Wilkins Jr. told the panel he would
have pushed for a vote on guidelines by the panel's four members,
but MacKinnon said he would not support any proposal until the
commission was brought up to full strength.
   In his testimony, MacKinnon dismissed suggestions that he
withheld his vote because of pressure from the White House or the
Justice Department.
   MacKinnon said he wanted to postpone the vote because he feared
that business interests that had waged ``vigorous if not vicious
opposition'' would ``attack these guidelines in an invalid point _
that they were not passed by a full commission.''
   MacKinnon said he told Justice Department officials of his
thinking during the March 13 meeting.
   The commission, created in 1984, has already promulgated
sentencing guidelines for individual defendants that specify
factors that should be used in calculating the length of prison
terms.

<HEAD>Amnesty Int'l Urges Inquiry Into Student Killings in Zaire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Thursday called on the
government of Zaire to set up an independent inquiry into the
reported killing of dozens of students at Lubumbashi University by
security forces.
   In Brussels, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said his
diplomats confirmed a number of students at the university had been
killed by soldiers May 11-12.
   ``There were victims, dead,'' he told Belgian radio. ``Figures
are not final. According to witnesses, between 10 and more than
100.''
   Zaire authorities have reported one dead and 13 injured.
   Authorities in Zaire denied earlier Belgian news reports that 50
to 150 students opposing President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime had
been murdered. Amnesty reports from Lubumbashi gave the same
figures.
   According to reports received by the respected human rights
group in London, government security forces allegedly used bayonets
and machetes to kill dozens of students in the southeastern Zairian
city.
   Amnesty said the unarmed students died ``under the cover of
darkness'' at the hands of security forces in a ``premeditated and
extensive'' attack, the group said in a written statement. Many
more students were believed to have been injured, the London-based
organization said.
   The killings allegedly took place after some students had beaten
several of their peers suspected of being informers for the
government.
   Amnesty ``is calling on the government to immediately set up an
independent inquiry into the reported killings and to bring those
responsible for the killings to justice.''
   The government has maintained the troops were used to quell
violence between students on campus.
   Soldiers from the elite presidential division allegedly carried
out the killings.
   Since April, students on several campuses throughout the former
Belgian colony, including in the capital, Kinshasa, have been
demonstrating for political reforms.
   On April 25, Mobutu announced the government would allow two new
political parties in addition to his ruling Popular Movement of the
Revolution.
   Five days later, the presidential troops used guns and bayonets
to disperse a crowd gathering for an opposition demonstration. Many
people were injured, several were reportedly killed and more than a
dozen demonstrators were arrested, Amnesty said.
   Demonstrations at the campus in Kinshasa, protesting the
government's refusal to implement promised reforms, sparked
demonstrations at other Zairean campuses.
   In Bukavu in eastern Zaire, three people accused of organizing
local farmers and instigating students demonstrations were arrested
and are belived to still be in custody, Amnesty said.
   The U.S. State Department said in its annual human rights report
that security organizations regularly harass, detain and physically
mistreat opponents. Several leading House Democrats have urged the
United States end aid to Mobutu, who has ruled since 1965.

   Here are details of the most-favored-nation
system of trade benefits. Bush renewed China's status for another
year on Thursday but said the Soviet Union still doesn't qualify.
   _The status entitles a country to the most-favorable levels of
U.S. tariffs. The United States extends the privilege to all its
major trading partners. Only 16 nations, including the Soviet
Union, Cuba and North Korea, don't receive the benefits.
   _China has had the status since 1980. The Soviet Union had it
from 1933 to 1952, when Congress revoked it. The Soviets have not
had it since then.
   _The Jackson-Vanik amendment to 1974 trade legislation denies
MFN status to countries that do not permit free emigration of
minorities. It is this law that now keeps the Soviet Union from
qualifying. President Bush on Thursday said China's emigration
policy makes it eligible for MFN treatment.
   _To regain MFN status, the Soviet Union must enter into a trade
agreement with the United States and it must put into law an
open-emigration policy. Moscow and the United States are currently
working on such a trade agreement. The Soviet Congress is expected
to act on a liberalized emigration law by late spring or early
summer.
   _MFN status must be renewed each year. Bush had until June 3 to
act on China's eligibility.
   _Although it may be hard for a nation like the Soviet Union to
get back on the list, once nations are there they tend to stay
there. Among the nations extended most-favored-nation treatment are
South Africa, Iraq and Syria.
   _Removal of MFN status can send tariffs soaring. The Bush
administration says tariffs on Chinese goods headed for the United
States would swell by an average 40 percent if the preferential
status were revoked. The US-China Business council says some
China-made toys now taxed at 6.8 percent would be taxed at up to 70
percent.
   _Revoking China's MFN status would also send tariffs soaring on
China-made good sent to the United States by Hong Kong. The
government of the British colony says $8.5 billion in annual sales
to the United States would be hit. Bush said he did not want to
make Hong Kong an ``innocent victim'' of U.S. differences with
Beijing.

<HEAD>Despite Publicity, ``Twin Peaks'' Not Ratings Biggie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite heavy publicity about its season finale,
ABC's surreal ``Twin Peaks'' was anything but a ratings smash, A.C.
Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed Thursday.
   Although it won its time period Wednesday night, the show
averaged only a 12.6 ratings and 22 percent audience share
nationally, well below the 21.7 rating and 33 percent share for the
series' much-publicized April 8 premiere.
   NBC was second during that time with an 11.5 rating and 19
percent share. The network countered ``Twin Peaks'' with the second
half of a one-hour ``Night Court'' rerun and a repeat of a ``Dear
John'' episode.
   Third-place CBS averaged a 10.5 rating and 19 percent share with
the second hour of its TV movie, ``How to Murder a Millionaire.''
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Although Wednesday's ``Twin Peaks'' left unresolved the question
of who killed Laura Palmer, the town's homecoming queen, that
apparently didn't matter to Chicago viewers.
   The episode got its highest local ratings in the Windy City,
averaging a 19.4 and a 30 percent audience share. New York was
second with a 17.8 rating and 28 share.
   The episode's third-highest local ratings were in Seattle,
possibly because the series directed by David Lynch is set in a
logging town in Washington state.
   Wednesday's episode averaged a 17 rating and a 32 percent
audience share in Seattle, Nielsen estimates showed.
   ABC announced this week that it had renewed the show for the
fall.

Fows stable of celebrity sneaker promoters, joining entertainer
Michael Jackson and football's Joe Montana with her own line of
footwear.
   The endorsement, announced Thursday, is the latest example of
manufacturers betting on celebrities rather than technical features
to sell athletic shoes.
   Miss Abdul, the former Los Angeles Laker basketball cheerleader
who became a video choreographer and pop singer, had formerly
pitched Reebok shoes.
   Reebok International Ltd. fell behind Nike Inc. as the leader in
the $5.5 billion athletic shoe market last year after Reebok was
tops in 1988.
   Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., uses only athletes to promote
its shoes _ a marketing strategy preferred 3-to-1 by retailers,
according to a survey of 18,000 outlets released this week by
Sporting Goods Business magazine.
   Among its best-known ad campaigns is the one that features
basketball star Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and the Air
Jordan line of shoes.
   Reebok, based in Stoughton, Mass., has used athletes in its ads,
and has reportedly been negotiating with the entertainer Madonna.
   L.A. Gear relies heavily on entertainers such as Jackson and
Priscilla Presley as well as sports stars such as Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Akeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and Montana.
   L.A. Gear trails both Nike and Reebok but expects to sell more
than $1 billion worth of shoes and apparel this year.
   It earned $55 million on sales of $617 million in fiscal 1989,
which ended Nov. 30. First quarter profits this year were $13.9
million on sales of $187.3 million, about triple the earnings and
revenues of the year-earlier period.
   Like Jackson and Montana, Miss Abdul will get a line of shoes
bearing her name and a commission based on sales as well as cash, a
person familiar with the deal said. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, he said Miss Abdul's deal will yield less than $10
million, putting her well behind Jackson who is reputed to be the
highest-paid sneaker pitchman at more than $10 million.

   President Bush urged Americans on Thursday to

25th anniversary.
   The president said in a proclamation that the program ``works
for children by enhancing their educational performance and really
fostering success in life. ''
   ``Head Start not only emphasizes proper nuturition and early
identification and treatment of health problems, but also offers
disadvantaged children a variety of learning experiences designed
to help them grow in curiosity and self-esteem,'' Bush said.
   ``Promoting the intellectual and emotional growth of these
children, as well as their physical well-being, Head Start has been
a model for child development programs,'' he said.
   Bush urged Americans to observe the anniversary of the program,
begun in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson, for its contributions
to the well-being of low-income children and their families.

<HEAD>East German Students Praise Decision to Fire School Chiefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German students on Thursday applauded a
government decision to fire 6,700 school directors and hundreds of
ideology teachers who once drilled Marxist doctrine into the
nation's youth.
   The educators will still be allowed to reapply for their old
jobs. But students said the move was an important step in repairing
an education system that faces huge changes in order to adapt to a
democratic society as East and West Germany reunite.
   Educators under the old hard-line regime played key roles in
identifying dissenters and indoctrinating students in Communist
ideology.
   Annette Blottner, a 22-year-old English language student at East
Berlin's Humboldt University, said the decision to open up the jobs
of top educators is justified even though many embraced the revolt
last year that toppled the old regime.
   ``I had a teacher who was so Stalinist, she damaged a lot of
futures of people,'' she said. ``Now, she acts like she was with
the revolution all the time.''
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler said Wednesday that in
addition to the 6,700 school chiefs, 550 professors and dozens of
other teachers who specialized in Marxist-Leninist doctrine also
would be removed.
   The school chiefs will be allowed to apply for their old jobs
and the ideology professors can seek new education posts, but they
must guarantee their ``democratic legitimacy,'' Gehler said.
   Falk Nisius, a mathematics and computer science teacher at
Humboldt, said most heads of schools were loyal Communists who came
through an educational system that only tolerated strict conformity.
   ``When you are a teacher, the first year you are idealistic and
think you will be different,'' said Nisius, 25. ``But after a few
years, you realize that you're job is to only stabilize the system.
The whole approach was to break you down.''
   East Germany also plans to disband the once-powerful youth
organization that for decades groomed loyal members and leaders of
the ousted Communist Party.
   The Free German Youth will soon lose its financing, said Youth
and Sports Minister Cordula Schubert in an interview Thursday with
the West German newspaper, the Berliner Morgenpost.
   Membership in the group was mandatory and helped direct the
career paths of the hard-line leaders who were overthrown in last
fall's revolt. Former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker was a
member of the group.
   The Free German Youth, which once had 2 million members, has
20,000 members.
   In another attempt to remove vestiges of the past, Economics
Minister Gerhard Pohl said Wednesday that 100 directors of East
German industries and businesses would be dismissed.
   All the moves are part of a program by the government to remove
industry and education leaders who got their jobs through strict
party loyalty and to prepare for the July 2 economic merger with
West Germany.
   Also Thursday, a government spokesman said 109 of the 149
members of the special anti-terrorist police unit worked as agents
for the disbanded secret police.
   The Interior Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the remaining 40 members of the anti-terrorist unit
came from the East German army.
   The anti-terrorist unit was formed in December under the former
government of Communist Premier Hans Modrow.
   He led the reform-oriented caretaker government that ran East
Germany after Communist hard-liners were ousted in November. But
Modrow's retooled Communist Party was voted out of power in the
nation's first democratic elections on March 18.
   The new government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere has been
debating what to do with the 80,000 people who once worked for the
secret police.

<HEAD>NBC Narrowly Beats CBS in Tightest May `Sweeps' Ratings Race In
Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC retained its Nielsen crown but suffered an
18 percent ratings drop as it narrowly beat hard-charging CBS in
what all three networks Thursday called the tightest May ``sweeps''
race in seven years.
   NBC, which has won the prime time ratings race for five straight
seasons, won the April 26-May 23 sweeps battle with an 11.9 ratings
average. CBS had an 11.8 and ABC an 11.4. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   The ratings sweeps, conducted four times a year, are month-long
periods of intensive local audience tallies that help stations in
the nation's 211 television markets set advertising rates.
   CBS has been third in prime time for three consecutive seasons.
Its return as strong competitor in the May sweeps battle was aided
by entertainment specials, including the pilot of ``I Love Lucy'';
TV movies and theatrical films; and two Connie Chung news specials.
All got high ratings.
   Although ABC was third in the May sweeps, it also got good news.
   Its programs, including ``China Beach'' and ``thirtysomething,''
helped make it first in ratings among viewers, particularly women,
considered the most desirable by advertisers _ age 18 to 54.
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home videos'' was easily the
highest-rated series during the sweeps race, with an average 38
percent share.
   The top 20 shows included Fox Broadcasting's ``Married ... With
Children'' and ``The Simpsons,'' which were tied in 17th place with
identical 23 percent audience-share averages.
   It was the first time Fox shows have cracked the top 20 list
during a sweeps race.
   NBC research vice president Robert Niles, acknowledging the
narrow margin of victory in NBC's ninth consecutive sweeps triumph,
nonetheless said he'd take it.
   ``A win is a win,'' he told reporters at the first of two news
conferences _ CBS research chief David Poltrack held the second _
at which the two officials generally accentuated the positive and
played down the negative.
   The last time the three networks were as close in May sweeps
ratings was in 1983, when CBS was first with a 15.1 ratings
average, followed by NBC with a 14.9 and ABC with a 14.7, according
to NBC research officials.
   Niles said NBC's 18 percent ratings fall-off in May compared
with the previous May was partly due to all-out efforts the network
made last year to win a record five consecutive May sweeps, and
partly because some tryouts of new series didn't work this time.
   However, he emphasized, one shouldn't look at the May results as
an indicator of what NBC's just-released 1990-1991 program lineup
will do next fall. ``We think we can turn this around as we go into
the fall,'' he said.
   Poltrack, whose network is to release its fall schedule either
Friday or next Tuesday, said there will ``a lot more CBS
firepower'' this fall because the network will have a heavy load of
TV and theatrical films.
   The latter include ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Field of
Dreams,'' part of a 10-picture package CBS bought this year from
Universal Studios.
   Poltrack called NBC's May results an omen of bad things to come
for that network. Comparing ABC's results with those of May last
year, he also said the success of ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' tended to mask declining ratings for four other ABC shows,
including the still-successful ``Roseanne.''
   There may be such a decline on a May-to-May basis, said ABC
research chief Alan Wurtzel, but the real test is how a show
performs over the course of a season.
   ``Sweeps are important to the affiliate stations,'' he said in
an interview. ``But I'm not so sure that a sweeps (period),
particularly if it's atypical, is a very good indicator of how
you're going to perform as a network.''

   President Bush on Thursday called for
restraint by Israeli soldiers in violent clashes with Palestinians,
saying he was ``troubled about the loss of human life.''
   Bush told a news conference the solution to the region's
problems is to get peace talks moving. ``I will do everything I can
to get the talks for peace going,'' he said.
   But he said the United States couldn't exert more pressure on
its longtime ally for peace talks with the Palestinians because of
Israel's own unsettled political situation.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is trying to form a new
government, but that process is expected to take another two weeks.
   ``There is no firm decision-making government in place. So we're
in a bit of a hiatus because of that,'' he said.
   Middle East violence flared this week after an Israeli gunman
killed seven Palestinians on Sunday. Demonstrations against Israel
and the United States spread in the region and more than a dozen
more Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli military
gunfire. Hundreds have been injured by bullets, beatings or from
inhaling tear gas.
   The new violence follows the 29-month-old intifada uprising in
which 710 Palestinians have died.
   Bush dodged questions about whether Israel was responding
appropriately to the Palestinian uprisings in the occupied
territories
   ``I have called on both sides for restraint. I've called on the
Israeli forces to show restraint,'' he said.
   He added, ``I'm worried about it. I`m troubled about the loss of
human life in this area ... particularly of children in this kind
of situation.''
   Bush said U.S. officials are ``talking with a lot of people'' to
try to promote the peace process and that he had spoken by phone on
Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday the United
States is prepared to discuss the idea of setting up a United
Nations observer force to protect the 1.7 million Arabs living in
the occupied territories.
   But Israel strongly opposes that idea and State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler issued a new statement reiterating
the long-standing U.S. opposition to U.N. observers permanently on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
   She said Baker had in mind temporary visits ``to check out'' the
situation, and was willing only to discuss such an arrangement at
the U.N. Security Council meeting in Geneva.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella for 46 groups, said
Baker's comment ``plays into the hand of Arab hard-liners and thus
disserves the cause of peace.'' He said statement ``appears to
distance the United States from Israel.''
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat is
expected to propose the use of U.N. observers in the territories
when he speaks Friday to a U.N. Security Council session in Geneva.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Bush's Middle East policy came under
sharp attack on Thursday, as a State Department report on the PLO
was presented to Congress.
   Democrats criticized the report's conclusion that the PLO has
lived up to its commitment to refrain from terrorism.
   The United States has said it would halt its dialogue with the
PLO if there were violations of that commitment.
   But Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., called the administration's report
a ``pack of lies ... a sham and a fraud.''
   John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the Middle
East, denied that the report was dishonest.
   There is ``no conclusive evidence to indicate PLO violations of
its commitment.''

   Looking for the latest shoulder-launched urban
assault rockets? How about an armed patrol boat, or the ultimate in
muzzle silencers?
   They were all available Thursday at a private weapons show _ at
least for those with the proper security clearance to get past the
door.
   The Covert &amp; Operational Procurement Exhibition at the Baltimore
Convention Center also features a line of a laser-sighted 9mm guns
that boast ``more firepower than you ever dreamed possible.''
   The private display was attended by law enforcement officers and
others cleared to buy and use such items as ``The Shockwave,''
which fires grenades designed to stun without spewing lethal
shrapnel.
   Outside the building, 20 demonstrators protested the weapons
exhibition. They handed out fliers saying ``arms bazaars, the
ultimate pornography.'' Three who entered the building were
arrested for investigation of trespassing and resisting arrest,
police said.
   The two-day COPEX 90 exhibition is the work of Osprey Media
Partners of England.
   ``We don't deal in battleships, tanks or space missiles,'' said
Julian Winkley, who organized the exhibition.Instead, the exhibit
is for special equipment for special applications like
counter-terrorism, drug interdiction, covert combat and clandestine
rescue operations, he said.
   Visitors have included members of police Special Weapons and
Tactics squads and hostage rescue teams. Representatives from 39
countries have registered, including some from the Far East, the
Middle East and South America, Winkley said.
   ``We still don't admit representatives from Communist
countries,'' he said. ``They don't have anything to sell.''
   Among the items on display:
   _ From McDonnell Douglas, a shoulder-launched multipurpose
assault weapon. The launcher fires high-explosive rockets and is
said to be ``on target ... in urban terror'' situations. It also
``does not require any specialized infantry skills.''
   _ A 100-round Calico 9mm pistol, carbine and tactical carbine.
The guns are light and can deliver ``more firepower than you ever
dreamed possible,'' according to promotional literature.
   ``The bright red dot instantly identified targets in excess of
100 yards indoors at night,'' Calico says.
   _ A Stinger Riverine Patrol Boat. Optional equipment on the
26-foot boat include a .50-caliber single or twin machine gun, an
automatic grenade launcher mounted aft, an ``Explosafe'' fuel tank,
camouflage paint and armored plating.
   _ The Shockwave, Multi-Shock, Nova-Shock and Multi-Nova Stun
Grenades are being displayed by First American Counter Terrorist
Systems Inc. The Balstrop, Texas-based company says the weapons
produce ``a concussive release of force without any shrapnel.''
   Nova-Shock and Multi-Nova go off in a ``single explosion with
maximum flash and white hot sparklets.'' But users need to be
careful: Firings ``create considerable indoor fire hazard,'' First
American says.
   Perhaps there's no better gadget on display at a ``covert''
exhibition than the ultimate in silencers. Precision Arms
International Inc. boasts that it has it _ ``the finest
state-of-the-art suppressed weapons system.''
   The system can muffle .22- to .50-caliber guns ``to fit the
needs of today's Special Ops Unit, SWAT teams police departments
and exotic weapons enthusiasts.''
   ``You'll have to see our product to believe it _ because you
won't hear it,'' Precision Arms says.

<HEAD>Boats Flood into Dunkirk on 50th Anniversary of Allied Evacuation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNKIRK, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of boats of all description
crossed the choppy English Channel and sailed into this French port
Thursday to commemorate the evacuation of Allied troops from
Dunkirk 50 years ago.
   The 10-hour crossing by the so-called ``Little Ships'' begins a
weekend of celebrations reuniting about 5,000 French and British
veterans _ some in their 90s _ who fled to England just ahead of
the advancing German army in 1940.
   The vessels hoisted the British naval ensign and entered Dunkirk
waters in formation Thursday afternoon behind the frigate HMS
Alacrity to be greeted by a throng of local officials and
well-wishers.
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing, I suppose,'' Hon. British
Consul to Dunkirk Sandy Baker said. ``They won't be able to do this
again 50 years from now.''
   Britain's Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, stood on
the Dover docks to give a royal send-off to 76 vessels reenacting
the World War II mission that rescued 338,000 troops off beaches in
northern France and Belgium before onrushing German troops.
   At the end of May 1940, tank-led German forces drove Allied
troops onto the beaches of Dunkirk and De Panne, Belgium, 20 miles
away, where they were trapped with their backs to the channel.
   On May 29, the British government appealed to owners of all
types of vessels to volunteer to help make up for the shortage of
troop transports, and amateur and professional sailors raced across
the channel in their boats to aid the Allies.
   Over the next seven days, an armada of about 860 naval ships,
fishing boats and pleasure craft rescued almost 400,000 British,
French and Belgian troops under enemy fire.
   On Thursday, less than two hours after the boats sailed from
southern England under bright blue skies, one skipper was airlifted
from his yacht when rough seas began causing trouble.
   Richard Huggett was picked up from his 33-foot yacht Papillon by
helicopter about seven miles off the British coast after suffering
back injuries, according to a coast guard spokesman.
   British coast guard boats stood by to shepherd the elderly
fleet, which could only travel as fast as the slowest boat, about 7
mph. In addition to winds and high seas, the boats had to sail
through the wakes of the ferries that frequently crisscross the
channel.
   About eight miles out, a boat that once carried Katharine
Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in the Hollywood film ``The African
Queen'' began taking on water off Ramsgate.
   A rescue helicopter from a neary Royal Air Force base and a
lifeboat were sent to escort and tow the 30-foot steam-driven
vessel back to harbor.
   A Dover coastguard spokesman said four people were on board,
including the American owner of the boat, Jim Hendricks.
   Hendricks, 55, a hotel owner from Key Largo, Fla., said the
system that pumps water into the boiler quit working.
   ``It was much rougher than I expected, the waves were getting
pretty high,'' Hendricks said, adding, ``It was just too much for
her.''
   The three-man crew of the boat, which Hendricks purchased in
1982, said they were afraid the boat was going to overturn in the
rough channel.
   Many of the boats experienced difficulties in the choppy channel
and at least one other yacht had to be towed back less than an hour
after setting sail.
   The flotilla, which will spend three days in the marine basin at
Dunkirk, included motor launches, cabin cruisers, Thames barges,
yachts, old lifeboats and a former torpedo boat. Many are the
original preserved craft that returned from the beaches in 1940
with thousands of expeditionary forces aboard.
   Events commemorating the rescue will include a parade, wreath
layings, lunches, parties and a prayer service in Dunkirk and in
nearby De Pannes.

<TEXT>
   NASA has confirmed next Wednesday as
the official launch date for space shuttle Columbia, grounded for
two weeks because of repairs to its cooling system.
   ``We're ready to go,'' agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone said
following a flight readiness review meeting Thursday.
   Columbia will carry seven astronauts and the Astro ultraviolet
and X-ray observatory, valued at about $150 million, when it takes
off on the first Spacelab mission since 1985. It will be the 36th
shuttle flight.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 12:38 a.m. EDT, making it the fifth
nighttime shuttle launch.
   The Astro mission originally was scheduled for March 1986, but
the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, resulted in a lengthy
delay. The flight was rescheduled for May 9 and then for around May
17, but a problem with Columbia's cooling system was detected.
   Technicians then removed a cooling valve with a torn filter from
the shuttle's payload bay and replaced it with a new one. It was
the first time such work had ever been performed on an orbiter at
the launch pad.
   A final check of the cooling system this week found everything
to be in order, Malone said. Technicians Wednesday removed a
makeshift platform erected in the payload bay and other work items
and spent Thursday closing out the shuttle's rear engine
compartment.
   ``We're not tracking any significant issues,'' Malone said.
``There were no problems during that whole repair process.''
   Columbia's flight is expected to last nine to 10 days. The four
astronomers who are part of the crew will operate Astro's three
ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope, located in the
payload bay.
   The instruments will photograph the ultraviolet sky and
simultaneously measure the high energy of ultraviolet and X-ray
radiation wavelengths, which are absorbed by the atmosphere and
therefore invisible from the ground.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced a new program for equal employment opportunity on
Thursday that he said would bring greater diversity to the
Agriculture Department.
   Yeutter said the department hopes to ``build a diverse work
force mirroring the nation's labor force at entry, mid-, senior and
executive levels by the year 2000 and ensure that this work force
delivers programs in an efficient, effective and fair manner.''
   The USDA has been criticized in the past for lagging in equal
opportunity programs. It ranks 52nd among 56 federal agencies in
the employment of women and minorities.
   Yeutter said the new plan is called ``Framework for Change: Work
Force Diversity and Delivery of Programs.''
   ``We have made progress, but we still must make significant
improvements,'' he said.

   Freed Beirut hostage Frank Reed will see his
91-year-old mother for the first time since his release when he
returns home Sunday to a hero's welcome, his daughter said Thursday.
   ``I think what's kept her going for the past 3{ years is (that)
this day will come,'' said Marilyn Langston. ``Once she sees him
and touches him, that will be very, very wonderful for her.''
   Ms. Langston, 33, said her grandmother, Leota Sprague, did not
travel to Frankfurt, West Germany to greet Reed, as younger family
members did.
   Reed grew up in Malden, a Boston suburb about five miles north
of downtown. Malden Mayor James Conway said city residents were
excited about the return of their native son.
   ``We're delighted that he is coming home,'' Conway said. ``We've
been waiting patiently for this. We look forward to sharing in his
joy and triumph.''
   All over the city, yellow ribbons adorned businesses and homes
to signify the vigil of those awaiting his return, Conway said. In
one city square, a billboard welcomes Reed back.
   ``There's a lot of feeling that the fellow went through a lot,''
Conway said. ``We've been remembering him in our prayers.''
   Reed will receive an official welcome from the city when he
lands at Logan International Airport, including police escort to
accompany a limousine carrying the former hostage home, said Linda
McManus, executive director of the Malden Chamber of Commerce.
   The city scheduled a parade to honor Reed on Tuesday, with the
Malden High School band and city dignitaries attending, Ms. McManus
said.
   The parade was scheduled after veterans complained about
tentative plans to honor Reed in conjunction with a Memorial Day
parade Monday. Ms. McManus said that wasn't the only reason for
scheduling the second parade; it was also planned to allow Reed a
day of rest at home.
   ``The purpose of the (Memorial Day) parade is not a celebration,
it's an observance for deceased war veterans,'' said Michael
Imbracsio, 65, a World War II veteran and former state commander of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   Reed, kidnapped in 1986 while serving as head of the private
Lebanese International School, was held by Moslem extremists until
last month. Since his release, he has been recuperating and
undergoing medical tests in Germany and since May 4 at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland.
   His daughter said Reed called her Thursday morning from the
Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews to tell her he was arriving
home Sunday.
   Air Force Sgt. Eddie Riley, a spokesman for the hospital, said
doctors there had said Reed would go to Massachusetts late Saturday
or early Sunday and return to the hospital Tuesday.
   However, Reed's son-in-law, Bob Langston, said Reed told him he
intended to participate in the parade and return to the hospital
later Tuesday or on Wednesday.
   Reed's wife, Fahima, and their 9-year-old son, Tarek, have lived
with Mrs. Sprague in her two-bedroom Malden apartment for almost a
year.
   ``I'm very pleased. I'm delighted. I can't wait,'' Mrs. Reed
said Thursday.
   Reed, 56, said he was beaten by his captors and blindfolded much
of the time. His daughter said he told her Thursday that he had
regained about 15 pounds of the 50 pounds he lost during the ordeal.
   ``He's been playing golf,'' Ms. Langston said. ``They've had him
out on the golf course at the base. He's also been undergoing
physical therapy to get him going.
   ``I'm really happy that he will finally be seeing my
grandmother. I know she's going to be ecstatic.''
   ``Of course it makes me feel grand,'' Mrs. Sprague said. ``We're
all very thrilled that he's coming back.''

   President Bush said Thursday he is troubled by
the perception that U.S. policy toward Cambodia is aiding the Khmer
Rouge rebels and said a review of alternative strategies is under
way.
   At the same time, Bush said he believes the administration is
``on the right track'' in its quest for a comprehensive settlement
to the 11-year old conflict in Cambodia. He denied reports that
U.S. weapons are reaching the Khmer Rouge.
   The United States has been providing limited assistance to the
non-communist resistance in Cambodia. Those groups have a tactical
alliance with the Khmer Rouge, which is believed to have been
responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during
its 3{ years in power in the 1970s.
   Critics in the Congress and elsewhere contend the United States
shouldn't aid rebel factions tied to the Khmer Rouge. At his news
conference, Bush was asked whether he was troubled that U.S. policy
has the side affect of helping the Khmer Rouge.
   ``To the degree it has any effect to help them, yes, I am
uncomfortable about it,'' Bush said.
   ``There's a discomfort level ... because of the brutality of the
Khmer Rouge ... We are reviewing the whole policy now,'' he said.
   The United States is working with the four other permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council in the quest for a settlement
in Cambodia. The five will meet in New York on Friday and leaders
of the various Cambodian factions will meet in Tokyo next week.
   After Bush spoke, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States hopes for a settlement that would verify the
complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.
   Other objectives include preventing the return to power of the
``murderous Khmer Rouge'' and genuine self-determination for the
Cambodian people through U.N.-administered free and fair elections
in a ``politically neutral environment,'' she said.
   Earlier, China, a key supporter of anti-government resistance
forces in Cambodia, said it is supporting plans for a cease-fire
there.
   ``The question of Cambodia deserves a comprehensive political
solution and a cease-fire is a component part of the agreement on a
comprehensive settlement,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua
said at a weekly briefing.
   Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan said the three-party
resistance, which is headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, had agreed
to sign a cease fire soon with the Vietnam-backed government in
Cambodia.
   The Cambodian government has objected to any participation in a
provisional government by the Khmer Rouge. China, which supplies
arms and equipment to the Khmer Rouge, says that group must be part
of any peace settlement.
   The proposed cease-fire is likely to be discussed when Cambodian
head of government Hun Sen meets Sihanouk in Tokyo June 4-5. Son
Sann, leader of another of the three guerrilla groups, will also be
in Tokyo and may take part in the talks. It is not certain if the
Khmer Rouge participate.
   Bush hopes to discuss Cambodia in his summit meeting next week
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a senior administration
official told reporters Thursday. The Soviets provide weapons to
the Hun Sen regime.
   The Bush administration believes the obstacle to a diplomatic
solution in Cambodia is Hun Sen's refusal to relinquish power in an
interim arrangement, said the official spoke to White House
reporters on the condition he not be identified by name.
   The administration sees United Nations peacekeeping role ``as
the only way to have an end to the war and some process for
self-determination,'' the official said. ``And in such a process we
think Hun Sen will have to step down as head of government.''

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Convince Gorbachev That Germany Belongs in NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that one of his
chief missions at next week's summit is to try to convince Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that a unified Germany should belong
to NATO.
   ``We'll sit down, he'll tell me his views and I will tell him
that he has absolutely nothing to fear from that formulation,''
Bush said in an interview with Gerd Helbig, a correspondent with
ZDF, German TV.
   ``Historically, they've seen NATO as an enemy. And we've seen
the Soviets as an enemy. Today, the enemy, in my view, is
instability, unpredictability (and) lack of confidence in each
other,'' Bush said.
   In a separate interview with Martyn Lewis of the BBC, Bush said
the impasse in the Soviet Union over the fate of Lithuania and
other Baltic states continues to cast a pall over the superpower
summit.
   ``There's a cloud of tension because of the Baltic states,''
Bush said.
   ``I determined a long time ago that it was important that this
summit meeting go forward and be successful,'' he said. ``And yet I
would be misleading you if I didn't say that the inability to get
dialogue going there between the Lithuanians and the Soviets does
cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the United States.''
   Both interviews were conducted in the White House on Thursday
afternoon after Bush addressed some of the same topics at a morning
news conference. The White House released transcripts of both
interviews.
   In the interview with German TV, Bush was asked what he might do
at the May 31-June 3 summit to make the notion of a unified Germany
inside NATO more palatable to Gorbachev.
   ``I feel (it is) incumbent on me to try to convince Mr.
Gorbachev that there is no threat to the Soviet Union with a
unified Germany and with a U.S. presence and with Germany as a full
member of NATO,'' Bush said.
   ``Now the Soviets don't agree with what I've just said,'' he
said, adding that he intended to engage the Soviet leader into a
``full discussion'' of the German unity question.
   In the same interview, Bush said he was ``a little
disappointed'' that talks over cutting the levels of troops and
tanks in Europe had seemed to bog down.
   ``I thought we would have the agreement further along,'' he said.
   ``We've got some big problems here. But we also have a lot of
common ground,'' he told the German TV interviewer.
   In the British interview, Bush said the European questions
likely to come up at the summit ``are not solved by a long shot.''
   Lewis asked Bush if he thought Gorbachev would survive
politically.
   ``I'm inclined to think the answer to your question is yes,''
Bush said. ``But it is not my role of as the president of the
United States to try to sort out who should lead the Soviet Union.
   ``In Mr. Gorbachev, I see a man who has presided over dramatic
changes in Eastern Europe that benefit freedom and benefit
mankind,'' Bush said. ``And so I give him credit for that.''

   A florist in a rural community who
claimed he was beaten and harassed because people wrongly thought
he had AIDS apparently made up the story, authorities said Thursday.
   Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes said Bill Grealis checked
himself into the psychiatric unit of Thomas Memorial Hospital on
Thursday after being confronted with evidence that he was making
harassing telephone calls to himself.
   Que Stephens Sr., head of the state Human Rights Commission,
said Grealis was the target of a sting operation involving 20
members of the attorney general's staff monitoring Grealis' home
and pay telephones. Stephens said Grealis did not know of the sting.
   ``We have been preyed upon by this guy,'' Forbes told a news
conference at the Capitol. ``There has been a perpetration of a
fraud on all of us who stand here, and all of the media, too.''
   Forbes said he did not know the reason behind Grealis' behavior,
saying the florist may have wanted the publicity.
   Grealis' plight came to the attention of reporters when he
complained he was threatened, beaten, his business boycotted and
his workplace broken into because of a rumor in the Campbell Creaks
community that he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Grealis had said business at his flower shop dropped 80 percent
since December and that he nearly went insane.
   He had said he lost weight because of a prostate ailment and
went so far as to post a negative AIDS test result on the shop
window in an attempt to convince his neighbors that he didn't carry
the deadly virus.
   Forbes said it appeared the alleged beating injuries may have
been self-inflicted and ``there's a lot of question whether or not
a robbery occurred.''
   ``It's been a tragedy,'' Forbes said. ``This guy has a very
serious problem of a psychological nature.'' No charges have been
filed against Grealis and the investigation is continuing, he said.

   Shouting ``Down with Communism!''
anti-government protesters on Thursday staged their largest rally
since nationwide voting that overwhelmingly backed the interim
leadership.
   The protesters demanded the ouster of President-elect Ion
Iliescu, a former Communist who has led the interim government
since the revolution that ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in
December.
   When a speaker accused Iliescu and his governing National
Salvation Front of rigging Sunday's election, about 8,000
demonstrators at University Square cheered wildly and shouted,
``Thieves!''
   One man who shouted ``Iliescu!'' was pushed and shoved and left
the square, pursued by shouting protesters. Several dozen
pro-Iliescu factory workers got into a shoving match with
demonstrators, but protest organizers separated them.
   About 600 of the demonstrators carrying candles later marched to
the television station where some of the fiercest fighting of the
revolution took place.
   The demonstrators, led by three Orthodox priests in black robes,
knelt at a memorial to the victims of the revolution while the
demonstrators prayed, sang and left flowers. Police did not
interfere, and the protesters later dispersed peacefully.
   With almost all votes counted late Thursday, Iliescu had 85.2
percent of the vote in the three-way presidential race. Radu
Campeanu of the National Liberal Party had 10.6 percent and Ion
Ratiu of the National Peasant Party had 4.2 percent.
   Several thousand protesters have flocked to University Square
nightly to support demonstrators who occupied it more than a month
ago and designated it a ``Communist-free zone.''
   But the largest post-election crowd flocked to the square
Thursday night, ignoring Prime Minister Petre Roman's warning that
the demonstration was ``unacceptable.''
   Police detained three people Thursday for advertising the rally.
   State-run radio quoted police as saying the protest was not
authorized. Only a few traffic police were in sight around the
square.
   Asked at a news conference Wednesday night if he would send in
police to clear the square, Iliescu said he would use ``no force
... I hope.''
   He accused the opposition of ``political immaturity'' for
claiming his election landslide was fraudulent.
   The demonstrators' major demand is to prohibit all former top
Communist officials _ including Iliescu _ from holding public
office for 10 years. Iliescu was a Communist Party Politburo member
for a time under Ceausescu.
   ``Iliescu can never get rid of the Communist methods,'' said
Niculina Posea, a 43-year-old homemaker. ``The elections were a
fake. I came here to demonstrate for democracy and freedom.''
   In a tent camp on the side of the square, 18 hunger strikers
continued to fast, despite a plea from Romania's best-known
dissident, Doina Cornea, to give up and help unite the opposition.
   ``I am prepared to die,'' said Bogdan Gradin, who has been
fasting since May 1. ``In Ceausescu's time it was enough not to
participate, not to prostitute yourself, but now it's a moral
commitment to do something more, and this is the only way I can.
   ``The Western democracies should initiate an economic blockade
... until we get a democratic government in Romania,'' he said.
   At a news conference, Peasant Party Chairman Corneliu Coposu was
asked if his organization would heed Iliescu's call to join in a
coalition government. He said Romania's three traditional
non-Communist parties _ the Peasants, Liberals and Social
Democratic Party _ had a post-election agreement with seven other
parties.
   ``These parties which have carried out the work for democracy
against the totalitarian regime will collaborate in Parliament and
in government together, but will conclude no accord with the
National Salvation Front,'' he said.

   Israel will not allow U.N. observers into the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, even if the U.N. Security
Council approves creating a special force to protect Palestinians,
Israeli leaders said Thursday.
   ``I don't assume the Security Council would decide so, since it
would clearly know that this decision would not be implemented, as
many other U.N. decisions against Israel,'' said Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``Israel will not be able to accept such a decision. Therefore,
I hope it would not be adopted,'' he said on Israel Television.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told a news conference Thursday he
hoped the 15-nation council, which is to meet in Geneva on Friday,
would turn down Arab calls for such a force.``Israel would not
accept U.N. observers on territory under Israeli control,'' Arens
said.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinian leaders have demanded international observers to
protect the 1.7 million Arabs in the territories from any excessive
force by the Israeli army.
   The calls have increased since Sunday's slaying near Tel Aviv of
seven unarmed Palestinian laborers by an Israeli gunman. Fifteen
more Palestinians, including an 8-year-old boy, have been killed
since then, most by gunfire from Israeli soldiers. Hundreds have
been injured.
   The latest victim was Mohammed Samir Salha, 15, who died at the
West Bank's Ramallah Hospital on Thursday of head and chest wounds
from plastic bullets, hospital officials said. He was shot during
an army raid on the village of Kibiya.
   Salha's death raised to 720 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the Arab uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied territories began in December 1987.
   An additional 216 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.
   The army on Thursday lifted a curfew on the Gaza Strip for two
hours to allow Palestinians to shop for food and other necessities.
The curfew has been in effect since Sunday.
   Arab reports said hundreds of Palestinian youths took to the
streets of Gaza City to burn tires and block roads with stones when
the curfew was relaxed.
   Arab hospital officials reported two wounded protesters at the
Jabaliya refugee camp. The army had no immediate confirmation.
   Curfews were lifted permanently from several large West Bank
towns, the army said.
   Also in the West Bank, angry Jewish settlers briefly blocked the
Jerusalem-Nablus road to protest a Palestinian stone-throwing
attack on a settler's car that reportedly injured an Israeli infant.
   A Soviet official warned Thursday that settlement of Soviet
Jewish immigrants in the occupied lands would block chances for
``normal relations'' between Israel and the Soviet Union.
   ``Israel is behaving like an elephant in a china shop, halting
process of normalization in the relations with Soviet Union,'' said
Michael Kapitsa, head of the Institute of Eastern Studies in Moscow
and a Supreme Soviet member.
   The Soviet Union cut ties with Israel after the 1967 war. It
renewed low-level diplomatic relations in 1987 but still has no
full diplomatic ties with Israel.
   In his remarks at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Kapitsa also
strongly criticized the crackdown on the Palestinian uprising. He
said it is in ``direct contradiction'' with other peaceful trends
in the world today.
   He was in Israel with a five-member delegation invited by a
Palestinian think tank.
   The call for a special U.N. force is expected to be made at the
Security Council meeting by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   In a surprise move Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker said the United States would consider a proposal for a
special U.N. force to be deployed in the territories.
   Arens said Israel was counting on the United States to veto any
U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an observer force.
   He also defended the army's actions this week, saying security
forces ``acted in an exemplary manner'' in dealing with widespread
rioting.
   Israeli officials contend Israel is legally responsible for
administering territories seized in the 1967 war and that foreign
observers already are present in the form of U.N. relief workers,
Red Cross teams, foreign aid officials and journalists.
   ``We have always opposed the idea of stationing U.N. observers
because we view it as a violation of Israel's sovereignty and an
intervention in our internal affairs,'' said Avi Pazner, Shamir's
spokesman.
   French government official Bernard Kouchner toured the Gaza
Strip on Thursday to evaluate the condition of Palestinian
residents.
   ``Gaza looks like a city of ghosts where women walk around with
babies in their arms in order to buy food,'' Israel radio quoted
him as saying.
   Kouchner, France's secretary of state for humanitarian action,
was one of the first foreigners to visit Gaza since Sunday's
shooting.
   Journalists have been barred from the Gaza Strip except with
army escorts.

   A grand jury indicted the operators of a
waste dump Thursday on a wide range of environmental and financial
charges stemming from a huge fire in the dump that closed a section
of Interstate 78.
   Four other waste hauling companies were also indicted on charges
that they illegally dumped at the site.
   The indictments accuse leaders of the bankrupt Hub Recycling
Inc. and two affiliated companies of operating an unauthorized dump
under the guise of a recycling facility, violating anti-pollution
laws and creating a risk of widespread injury or damage.
   A fire in mounds of garbage at the Hub site at the base of the
highway on Aug. 7, 1989, warped steel girders and buckled concrete
on a busy portion of Interstate 78.
   The section of the 10-lane highway near Newark was closed,
forcing thousands of commuters and truckers to find other routes
into New York City. A part of the highway was reopened nine days
later, but repairs were not complete until December. The repairs
cost the state $5 million.
   State Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo and Environmental
Prosecutor Steven J. Madonna announced the indictments.
   Hub operators Michael Harvan and Richard Bassi were both named.
They are serving 17-year prison sentences for a prior bribery and
illegal dumping conviction. If convicted, the new charges could
mean jail sentences of up to 204 years, and $1.7 million in fines,
officials said.
   The two subsidiary companies named are Bay International
Equipment Rental Inc., and Harbas Trucking Inc.

   Ohio State officials who shut down a
dormitory wing following death threats against two homosexual
students said Thursday they will seek criminal charges against the
people responsible.
   Officials moved 32 male students from a third-floor wing of a
dormitory Wednesday after one threat was written on a notice taped
to the door of the gay students' room.
   The words ``Die Fags'' were found on the notice.
   The notice from the university's Office of Residence Life had
been sent to all students in the dorm wing Tuesday, warning they
would be reassigned to other dorms if another act of harassment or
intimidation toward the gay students was reported.
   The threatening note was taped to the center of the door,
surrounded by 14 copies of the university notice.
   ``We are actively investigating this threat as well as telephone
death threats the students received before this,'' said William
Hall, Ohio State University's director of residence and dining
halls. ``I can't say now that we have any solid leads, but we hope
to come up with some. Charges will be filed.''
   Hall said not all of the students forced to move were involved
in the harassment, but that it was necessary to move the entire
floor.
   Students Mike Scarce and Tom Fletcher became the target of
harassment last October.
   Their names appeared in a campus newspaper article reporting the
events of ``Coming Out Week'' on campus, said Michael McFadden,
executive director of Stonewall Union, a lesbian-gay community
service and advocacy organization.
   The two said in an interview published Thursday in The Columbus
Dispatch that they are not lovers, but decided to room together
after they met last year.
   Scarce said he believes the school took too long to take action
and will seek reimbursment for three-quarters of their tuition and
room and board costs.
   ``This is no environment to live in, let alone to be educated
in,'' he said.
   Hall said the school will negotiate with the two.
   The two students could not be reached for comment Thursday.
University spokesman Steve Sterrett said they had moved to an
off-campus apartment, but declined to give an address.

<HEAD>City Reports 100 Percent Compliance With Cigarette Machine Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ordinance banning cigarette
vending machines has met with total compliance since it went into
effect in January, a city official said Thursday.
   ``We've had a tremendous amount of success with our ordinance
here,'' said City Manager Mark Sather. ``When the ordinance took
effect, we had 100 percent compliance and little or no opposition.''
   On Thursday, federal Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan proposed model federal legislation to help states outlaw
cigarette vending machines, as well as place other restrictions on
young people's access to cigarettes.
   ``You can't buy beer from a vending machine,'' he said in
testimony prepared for the Senate Finance Committee. ``Why should
you be able to purchase cigarettes there?''
   White Bear Lake already took such a step last October, when the
Twin Cities suburb of around 25,000 approved an ordinance to remove
the 19 machines in local bars, gas stations, convenience stores and
apartment and office buildings.
   It was the first city in Minnesota to enact such a ban, but at
least 20 other Minnesota cities have prohibited or limited such
sales since White Bear Lake's action.
   ``We've had well over 200 communities from coast to coast call
and ask for copies of our ordinance and so it's gained quite a bit
of notoriety,'' Sather said.
   The vending machine industry has argued that children can be
protected without a total ban using techniques such as employee
supervision of machines and electronic locking devices that must be
activated by an employee.
   But anti-smoking activists contend that youngsters would find
ways to buy cigarettes as long as the machines were in use.
   ``Obviously, we're encouraged by it for the same reasons the
local ordinance was adopted here,''
   Sather said he found the administration's proposal a good idea
``for the same reasons the local ordinance was adopted here.''
   ``The advantage of trying to prevent or avoid juveniles trying
to smoke is the primary purpose behind our ordinance, to make it
difficult for them to gain access to cigarettes. We think it sends
a message that we don't condone it.''

   St. Kitts police took two men into
custody Thursday for questioning in the killing of an American
businessman who was gunned down in his home by masked intruders,
officials said.
   David Henry, 28, an executive for Pico Products Inc., a New
York-based electronics company, was shot to death Wednesday night
during an islandwide power outage, according to police.
   He suffered gunshot wounds in the neck and leg and was
pronounced dead on arrival at Joseph N. France General Hospital.
   Two masked men broke into Henry's home and shot him to death,
police said. No other details of the killing, including the motive,
were disclosed.
   Investigators took two men into custody for questioning and
confiscated a pickup truck owned by one of them. No charges were
lodged by Thursday night.
   Henry moved to St. Kitts from New York about five years ago and
held a senior management position at a Pico assembly plant,
officials said.
   Police said a forensic pathologist probably would be brought in
from overseas to perform an autopsy.
   The twin island-state of St. Kitts-Nevis is a former British
colony of 44,600 inhabitants in the Leeward Island chain 225 miles
southeast of Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>Officials Say U.S. Won't Return Mexican Doctor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has no plans to return a
Mexican doctor brought across the border by bounty hunters to face
charges of participating in a drug agent's murder, officials said
Thursday.
   Mexico's request for the return of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain
was received by the State Department and the U.S. will ``respond in
due course,'' Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said.
   However, officials who spoke on condition of anonymity noted
that Mexico had not made a formal extradition request, calling
merely for Alvarez's return.
   The officials also pointed to recent public statements by the
Justice Department stressing that the U.S. had no plans to return
Alvarez to his homeland.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said several weeks ago
that he couldn't ``foresee any circumstances'' under which Alvarez
would be returned.
   Alvarez, accused of participating in the torture and murder of
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, was
abducted by bounty hunters and flown to El Paso, Texas, on April 3.
   His arrest by waiting DEA agents touched off a diplomatic flap
between the two nations that included a charge by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari that it violated Mexico's sovereignty.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a May 10 interview,
however, that he was not concerned about the circumstances of
Alvarez's delivery to the U.S. border. He invited bounty hunters to
turn over more Mexicans wanted in the Camarena case.
   ``Whatever actions that are carried out by Mexican authorities
are of no moment to us,'' Thornburgh said.
   The Mexican Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued
Wednesday in Mexico City that the government wanted Alvarez's
return for questioning about possible crimes in Mexico. The
statement did not mention specific cases.
   ``This request is based fundamentally on the fact that the
procedure followed by his captors and those who transferred Dr.
Alvarez Machain violated'' articles of the Mexican constitution,
the statement said.
   Alvarez is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles on Friday for a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the
charges because the circumstances of his arrest amounted to
``outrageous government conduct.''
   Last week, the Justice Department filed papers claiming that a
Mexican police official last year delivered an offer to swap a
suspect in the Camarena case for a fugitive wanted by Mexican
authorities.
   The papers quoted the Mexican official as saying he was speaking
on behalf of Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo.
The Mexican attorney general has since issued a statement denying
the Justice Department claim.
   Antonio Garate Bustamante, a former Mexican police official
residing in Los Angeles, has said he arranged Alvarez's abduction
for DEA.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Seeking Change in FAA Policy On AIDS, Diabetes
Drugs</HEAD>

   Air traffic controllers who take drugs to
treat diabetes or AIDS should not automatically lose their jobs,
leaders of a House subcommittee said Thursday.
   Reps. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., and Constance Morella, R-Md.,
urged the Federal Aviation Administration to change what they
consider a discriminatory policy.
   Darlene Freeman, FAA deputy associate administrator for aviation
standards, told the House subcommittee on the Civil Service the
agency offers administrative jobs to controllers who take insulin
for diabetes or AZT to combat AIDS.
   ``That's discrimination,'' subcommittee chairman Sikorski said
after testimony from patients and a diabetes expert that insulin
users pose no more risk on the job than people with moderately high
blood pressure. Those with moderately high blood pressure are not
excluded from air traffic control positions.
   ``It's discrimination for the sake of safety,'' said William
Hark, an FAA medical specialist. He said controllers who take
insulin could suffer episodes called hypoglycemia, which could
severely inhibit their work keeping track of aircraft.
   Hypoglycemia can cause faintness, palsy, confusion, visual
disturbances or weakness.
   The FAA says that since the insulin policy was put into effect
in December, the agency's flight surgeon, Dr. Robert McMeekin, has
issued instructions that 22 controllers taking insulin can no
longer work at radar screens.
   Sikorski criticized the FAA for its refusal to allow Dulles
Airport controller Ron Wilkinson to continue on the job after he
began taking AZT last year.
   ``Lord knows what vague rumors that decision was based on,'' he
said.
   Wilkinson, who attended the hearing but did not testify, said
after the session that the FAA suggested this week he might get an
administrative job at Dulles. He said he is under a doctor's care
in Florida and believes he should be given a position there as a
controller.
   Hark said no final action had been taken to disqualify
Wilkinson, who he said went on leave in July to seek treatment for
``an undisclosed illness.''
   The FAA official said the agency was re-examining its policy on
AZT but probably would not change it without at least several
months of study.
   Dr. William Reiter, director of the Center for Special
Immunology in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where Wilkinson is being
treated, has said that tests of patients on AZT have shown no
significant sleepiness, dizziness or any other problems.
   Witnesses at the subcommittee hearing included Minnesota Vikings
quarterback Wade Wilson, who spoke for the American Diabetes
Association, and said his diabetes had not affected his performance
as a professional football player.
   ``Each person's case should be considered individually, and
medical disqualification of all air traffic control specialists
solely because they require insulin is blatantly discriminatory,''
Wilson said.
   Dr. Robert Ratner, director of the diabetes center at George
Washington University, who said only four to 10 hypoglycemia
episodes a year would be suffered among every 10,000 people who are
dependent on insulin.

   President Bush said Thursday that the Kremlin's
standoff with Lithuania and the other independence-minded Baltic
states has created a ``cloud of tension'' leading up to next week's
U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington.
   Bush, however, said he expects progress on arms control and
German unification during his May 30-June 3 meetings with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In a U.S. interview with British Broadcasting Corp. Television,
he said, ``I determined long ago that it was important that this
summit meeting go forward and be successful.
   ``And yet I would be misleading you if I didn't say the
inability to get dialogue going there between the Lithuanians and
the Soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the
United States,'' the president said in the Washington interview.
   He added, ``There's a cloud of tension because of the Baltic
states.''
   In the continuing test of wills, Gorbachev threatened Thursday
to impose presidential rule in Lithuania if it does not freeze the
independence it declared March 11, a Lithuanian legislator said.
But Gorbachev also offered to lift economic sanctions if Lithuania
suspends the declaration.
   In the Thursday talks with Lithuanian legislators, Gorbachev
said the republic could win independence in two years if it follows
the procedure set out by Moscow.
   Bush told the BBC the summit would give him a chance to ``to
reaffirm the United States' commitment to freedom and
self-determination'' for Lithuania.
   He pointed out that the United States has never recognized the
Soviets' 1940 incorporation of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which
had been independent since the end of World War II.
   Bush also said the Soviet Union's domestic problems should not
affect talks on reducing nuclear weapons.
   The summit is expected to seal an agreement on deep cuts in
chemical and long-range nuclear weapons.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze struck a tentative agreement in Moscow
last week that calls for 30 to 35 percent reductions in long-range
nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines.
   Some critics have said the summit should have been postponed to
pressure Moscow into meeting the Lithuanian demands. But Bush
disagreed.
   ``We talked to the Soviet Union when Czechoslovakia was what we
call a captive nation, when Hungary was and Poland was. Were we
sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with the
Soviet Union? Now the world would clearly say, `Of course you
weren't.'''
   Bush also said he would be talking with Gorbachev about reducing
non-nuclear forces and chemical arms. He said German reunification
and its implications for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
will be discussed.
   ``I think NATO has a broader mission, and I believe we can
convince the Soviets that that is in their interest. ... And I
think they don't need to have inordinate fears of a unified
Germany, so we have to talk all this out with Mr. Gorbachev,'' he
said in a separate U.S. interview with Britain's Independent
Television News.
   The United States wants a unified Germany to belong to the
Western NATO military alliance, but the Soviets say both East and
West bloc troops should remain at least until new security
mechanisms are created.

   Tornadoes skipped across portions of Wyoming on Thursday as a
storm system crossed the Rocky Mountains. The same weather front
brought snow to parts of Nevada, Idaho and Utah and locally heavy
rains.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell on parts of the Midwest and
Florida, and scattered showers fell from the Pacific Northwest to
the Rockies.
   There were five tornado sightings in eastern Wyoming, and a
funnel cloud was reported in Sheridan County in the north-central
part of the state. A funnel cloud becomes a tornado once it touches
the ground.
   Although five sightings were reported, there may have been only
two or three tornadoes, said Mike Weiland of the National Weather
Service. ``Some of these reports might be of the same tornadoes,''
Weiland said.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage.
   Snow fell overnight in northeastern Nevada and parts of Idaho
and Utah. Five inches of snow fell at Austin, Nev.
   Further south, a wind advisory was posted for northern Arizona,
where gusts to 43 mph were reported at Winslow. Strong, gusty winds
were also reported in northern Utah.
   Showers were scattered from eastern Washington state, eastern
Oregon and northeastern Nevada to the northern and central Rocky
Mountain region. Showers also were reported over western Nebraska
and western South Dakota. A mixture of rain, snow and hail fell at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   A tornado watch was in effect for parts of east-central and
southeastern Montana, much of eastern Wyoming, portions of western
South Dakota and portions of the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Showers and thunderstorms were clustered over eastern Kansas,
western and central Missouri and southern and central Iowa early
Thursday afternoon. Showers and thunderstorms south of Kansas City,
Mo., produced 2 inches of rain at Stilwell, Kan.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also reported over southern
Florida.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies over much of California, Nevada and Arizona.
   Temperatures dipped into the 30s in New England and eastern New
York state, and into the 30s and upper 20s in the Great Basin and
the northern Plateau region.
   The low of 47 degrees at Cape Hatteras, N.C., was a record for
the date.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 29 degrees at Lakeview, Ore.

   The USS Iowa was conducting firing exercises
some 330 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico when an explosion in
its No. 2 gun turret killed 47 sailors in the Navy's worst disaster
since the Vietnam War.
   Theories abounded about the cause of the April 19, 1989
explosion and naval investigators quickly centered on reports a
falling out between two crew members might have sparked sabotage.
   Ultimately, not even that theory could be proven for sure, but
the Navy concluded that the ``most likely'' cause was ``a wrongful,
intentional act'' caused by gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig, who was
among those killed in the explosion.
   Crew members, congressional investigators and others criticized
that finding, and the Navy's decision Thursday to re-open the
investigation into the blast likely will add to the uncertainty.
   Also adding to the debate will be a General Accounting Office
report due to be released Friday that lawmakers said casts further
doubt on the Navy's findings.
   A scientist from Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
N.M., hired by the GAO to review physical evidence from the blast,
will testify Friday before a Senate Armed Services Committee
hearing on the new report.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, the House member who represents
the Hartwig family, said she was gratified that the Navy was
``finally acknowledging that their first report was absolutely
superficial and that they maligned and tried to destroy the
reputation of a young killed seaman.''
   In the weeks and months after the explosion, there were reports
of crew incompetence, poor leadership by officers and possible
mishandling of the ship's gunpowder stores during an overhaul.
   The skipper, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, complained to investigators
that he took over a ship staffed with ``dopers, marginal
performers'' and rejects from other vessels. Investigators later
cited Moosally and two other officers for administrative
deficiencies but said the problems were not linked to the explosion.
   Moosally, speaking at his retirement ceremony on May 4, laid
down a barrage of criticism of the Navy's investigation, asserting
that it was based on ``facts and opinions based on unsubstantiated
third-party information, unsubstantiated reports and supposition.''
   Report after report surfaced of Navy investigators blaming the
blast on a crew member, indentified later as Hartwig, with some of
the leaks from investigators contending Hartwig was depressed
because of a falling out with fellow Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt
because Truitt rejected his homosexual advances.
   Still more reports said investigators believed there had been a
homosexual relationship between Hartwig and Truitt, something
Truitt denied in congressional testimony in which he faulted the
Navy investigation and said Hartwig was no ``suicidal freak.''
   Truitt and Hartwig's family bitterly contested those
allegations, and the Navy did not detail them in its official
report.
   Angered with the speculative nature of the report, congressional
investigators said the Navy should have issued inconclusive
findings instead of saying Hartwig probably caused the blast.
   ``Wouldn't it have been better off to say `we don't know,'''
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., said after one of several
congressional hearings on the explosion. ``I find it quite
irresponsible that the Navy would issue a report on a probable
cause rather than have documented evidence that they can prove.''
   But the Navy stood by its findings, saying that while it could
not say for certain that Hartwig caused the explosion it had ruled
out other possible causes, including mechanical error or an
accidental procedural error by a sailor.
   The explosion in the center gun of No. 2 turret, the Navy
concluded, was caused by the premature ignition of five bags of
gunpower while the breech of the gun was open.
   The explosion was the greatest tragedy for a ship that had been
struck only once by enemy fire in two wars and 1988 patrol duty off
the Persian Gulf.
   Launched in 1942, the Iowa was active in World War II and the
Korean War. It then was mothballed for 24 years before being
refitted for modern warfare as part of the Reagan administration's
military buildup.
   It was the first of four sister ships that today are the only
active battleships in the world, brought out of mothballs in the
early and middle 1980s because of their vast carrying capacity for
new missiles, thick armor to resist battle damage, tremendous
firepower to support the landing of troops, substantial remaining
service life and the fact that a surprising number of the world's
potential trouble spots are on a seacoast.
   The 887-foot Iowa class battleships displace 58,000 tons and
carry nine 16-inch guns in three turrets with 17-inch armor on
their faces. Side armor is 12 inches thick.
   Secondary armament was reduced from 20 5-inch guns in 10 turrets
to 12 guns in six to make room for missiles. Anti-aircraft defense
is provided by 3,000 round-per-minute Phalanx 20mm guns firing
rounds made of depleted uranium.
   The ships were believed to have been capable of 35 knots with
clean bottoms when young, but additional weight today has slowed
them slightly. Recent speed tests have showed them capable of 31
knots _ almost 36 mph.
   The modern equipment installed as part of the $400 million
refitting allowed the ship to operate with a crew of 60 officers
and 1,500 enlisted men, down from 117 officers and 1,800 enlisted
men aboard during World War II.
   The Iowa and sister ship New Jersey are to be mothballed again
because of Pentagon budget cutbacks. Its No. 2 turret has not been
fired since the explosion.

   President Joaquin
Balaguer has eked out a close victory over a longtime leftist rival
to win re-election, according to results released Thursday.
   But the victory of the conservative president, 83 and blind from
glaucoma, will not be assured until election officials review tally
sheets for fraud and voting irregularities. That process is
expected to take several days.
   The Central Electoral Board on Thursday released all the results
from the 6,663 polling stations in the May 16 balloting.
   Balaguer had 669,063 votes, and former President Juan Bosch, an
80-year-old Marxist who campaigned on a moderate platform, had
647,369.
   The review of tallies was ordered after Bosch accused Balaguer
of fraud and threatened street demonstrations in the capital to
prevent ``the elections from being stolen from the people.''
   Election officials are reviewing tally sheets in the presence of
international observers and the country's four main political
parties.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30 international observers
who monitored the elections, recommended last week the vote count
be verified.
   Carter is to return to this Caribbean nation of 7 million people
on Friday to participate in the laborious tally survey.
   He had said the review, though short of a vote-by-vote recount,
would establish if fraud or ``honest errors'' were committed.

<TEXT>
   An effort to save tens of thousands of
military jobs by trimming funds for strategic weapons has been
postponed until after next week's U.S.-Soviet summit, a lawmaker
said Thursday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said a possible deal between Congress and the Pentagon,
which appeared possible on Thursday, had been put off until June 15.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he ``can't take money out of
strategic weapons before the summit,'' Aspin said.
   President Bush said Thursday that his planned summit with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev would likely produce few signed
agreements. Bush promised, however, to seek significant progress on
arms talks.
   Bush said he had no problems with the agreement on reductions in
long-range nuclear weapons Secretary of State James A. Baker III
negotiated with Moscow. Bush and Gorbachev are to sign off on the
broad details of that deal but the specifics still are being
negotiated.
   Among the sources of funds proposed by Aspin to boost the
Pentagon's personnel accounts were the B-2 stealth bomber,
Strategic Defense Initiative, MX nuclear missile and SSN-21 Seawolf
Attack submarine programs.
   The Pentagon had said it needed the money for personnel accounts
by June 1 or pink slips would have to be sent out to uniformed men
and women. However, Aspin said, the layoffs will not occur on June
1.
   Earlier this year, the Pentagon asked for authority to move $852
million from other accounts to personnel to avoid the dismissal of
military personnel by October. The cuts are required under the
Gramm-Rudman budget cutting law.
   Such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the House and
Senate Armed Services committees and the House and Senate
Appropriations committees.
   But earlier this year, Aspin, with the backing of House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., declined to bring the Pentagon's request
before his committee.
   President Bush had the option of exempting military personnel
from the Gramm-Rudman law, but decided against it. Aspin charged
that Bush favored weapons over people.
   The Pentagon estimated that without the reprogramming authority,
44,100 to 68,200 military personnel would have to be fired by Oct.
1; between 32,500 and 32,600 people would be frozen in their
current jobs; 57,000 to 67,000 promotions would be delayed; and
59,900 to 115,900 fewer men and women could be brought into the
armed forces.
   There are about 2.1 million uniformed personnel.

<TEXT>
   Ella Pauline Holley, mother of late rock
n' roll star Buddy Holly, has died at age 87.
   Services were held Tuesday for Mrs. Holley, who died Sunday at
West Texas Hospital in Lubbock after a long illness.
   Buddy Holly, who changed the spelling of the family name when he
went into the music business, is widely credited with inspiring
such groups as the Beatles with such late 1950s hits as ``Peggy
Sue,'' ``Rave On'' and ``Maybe Baby.''
   Holly died in a plane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa, in 1959.
   In 1979, Mrs. Holley and her husband, Lawrence O. Holley, filed
a $300,000 lawsuit against the producers of the 1978 movie ``The
Buddy Holly Story,'' claiming the film inaccurately portrayed their
relationship with their son.
   The Holleys said the movie suggested they were unsupportive of
their son's career when, in fact, they were very supportive. They
settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money.
   Lawrence Holley died in 1985.
   Mrs. Holley is survived by sons Larry and Travis, both of
Lubbock; daughter Pat Kaiter of Lubbock; seven grandchildren and
seven great-grandchildren.

   A Venezuelan drug ring was broken up when
authorities seized nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine from an exporter
and arrested seven people, U.S. Customs officials announced
Thursday.
   Venezuelan authorities on Wednesday seized more than 225
kilograms of cocaine and arrested three men for attempting to ship
the drugs from Caracas to Baltimore, said Donald G. Turnbaugh,
chief Customs agent for Baltimore.
   A shipment of 221 kilograms of cocaine sent from the same
Venezuelan exporter _ Nikolmar Import y Export, C.A. _ was seized
May 15 at the Port of Baltimore, customs agents said Thursday.
   The drugs were tightly wrapped in one-kilogram packages and
sprinkled with pepper, a common method of disguising the scent from
drug-sniffing dogs. A kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds.
   Customs officials put the street value of the two seizures at
$35 million.
   Three New Jersey men and one from New York were arrested after
authorities allowed part of one shipment to reach New York.
   The four were in the custody of customs officials in New Jersey,
pending extradition to Maryland. They face charges of conspiracy to
import and distribute a controlled substance and possession with
intent to distribute the cocaine, U.S. Attorney Breckinridge
Willcox said.
   In both seizures, the cocaine was concealed in false-bottomed
metal boxes marked as containing bathroom fixtures and sent by the
Venezuelan company, said Jack Taylor of Baltimore's Drug
Enforcement Administration office.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   At least 380 people may die on the nation's roads
this Memorial Day weekend, the start of the summer driving season,
the National Safety Council said Thursday.
   The counting period begins at 6 p.m. local time Friday and ends
at 11:50 p.m. Monday night.
   ``This year, between 380 to 480 people may die in traffic
accidents. Additionally, 18,000 to 23,000 people may suffer
disabling injuries,'' said Lisa Grady, spokeswoman for the
Chicago-based council.
   Last year, 441 people died and 20,000 were injured over the
three-day Memorial Day weekend.
   ``The National Safety Council also would like people to follow
our safety rules: Don't drink and drive, and if you do drink, use
the designated driver program,'' Ms. Grady said.
   ``Plan plenty of travel time,'' she said. ``It's better being
late than not arriving at all. Remember to use safety belts and put
small children in approved child car-seats.
   ``The council estimates that more than 12,000 lives could be
saved each year if everybody used safety belts,'' she said.

<HEAD>New York Republicans Focus On Economist As Cuomo Challenger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's beleaguered Republican leaders
struggled Thursday toward a ticket, possibly headed by a Wall
Street economist, to challenge the expected re-election bid of Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
   Canadian-born Pierre Rinfret, largely unknown in New York
political circles, emerged as the leading contender for the GOP
nomination after John Loeb Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to
Denmark, took himself out of contention.
   Loeb, a wealthy investment counselor whose name had surfaced
only this week as a potential gubernatorial candidate, said he
planned to be ``a wholehearted supporter'' of Rinfret.
   Nonetheless, Rinfret said through a spokeswoman that he hadn't
decided whether to run.
   And New York University professor Herbert London, the favorite
of the state's tiny but politically influential Conservative Party,
hadn't been ruled out of contention for the Republican nomination.
   Democrat Cuomo, who has more than $7 million in his campaign
warchest, is expected to announce plans soon to run for a third,
four-year term. He's widely viewed as a potential contender for his
party's 1992 presidential nomination.
   State GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett, a former head of the Avis
car rental company, has been searching for a Cuomo challenger for
almost a year, only to be turned down by one Republican after
another.
   New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last year likened a race against
Cuomo to a ``kamikaze'' mission.
   With the Republican state nominating convention starting next
week, Barrett and other Republican leaders began a frenzied round
of meetings and telephone calls this week in search of a credible
Cuomo challenger. State Sen. Roy Goodman, the Manhattan GOP
chairman, suggested Rinfret and Loeb.
   Little known outside the financial community, the two were
interviewed Wednesday by Barrett.
   ``I know only what I've read in the paper,'' said Westchester
County GOP Chairman Anthony Colavita, a former state chairman, when
asked about Rinfret.
   ``I don't know this guy and neither does anyone else,'' said
Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party. ``All I know is
that he worked for two Democratic presidents and is pro-choice (on
abortion). I'm not terribly comfortable with that.''
   However, Goodman said Rinfret was ``a dynamite speaker'' who
would be able to raise enough money to mount a credible challenge
to Cuomo.
   Rinfret, an unpaid adviser to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon, runs an economic consulting firm in New York City. He lives
in Manhattan, graduated from New York University and holds a
doctorate in political economics from the University of Dijon in
France.
   Should Rinfret be the GOP candidate, his campaign would likely
focus on the state of New York's economy and Cuomo's management.
The state is in its third straight year of budget deficits and
Cuomo is about to approve a record $1.8 billion tax-increase
package as part of a new state budget.

   A car bomb exploded Thursday at a police
post near a luxury hotel in the cocaine capital of Medellin,
killing five people and injuring at least 21 others, a city
spokesman said.
   The blast occurred less than a block from the Intercontinental
Hotel. It damaged nearby buildings and destroyed several cars, said
Cesar Perez, press spokesman for Mayor Juan Gomez.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. But
police have blamed Colombia's powerful drug lords for a series of
bombings in the days leading up to Sunday's presidential election.
   It was the sixth powerful bomb to go off in Colombia the last
two weeks. The other five blasts killed 28 and injured about 300.
   Government officials said the attacks were part of a plan by
drug lords to scare people from the polls.
   Meanwhile, a police officer was shot to death in Medellin
outside of a local office of the ruling Liberal Party. His death
brought to 34 the number of policemen killed in Medellin the last
15 days.
   The Medellin drug cartel has offered to pay $4,300 for each
policemen killed as part of their campaign of violence.

   ``Twin Peaks'' _ the offbeat saga of murder,
mayhem, and doughnuts in the Pacific Northwest _ sparked seemingly
endless speculation about who killed Laura Palmer and consternation
when the final episode left loose ends galore.
   Those rehashing the ABC series directed by David Lynch and
bemoaning the long wait until the show resumes in the fall include
subscribers to CompuServe, a computer information service featuring
electronic bulletin boards.
   Although the last episode aired Wednesday night drew relatively
low ratings, the show has attracted a small but loyal following
fascinated with the twists and turns involving homecoming queen
Laura, FBI agent Dale Cooper, Sheriff Harry Truman,
naughty-but-well-intentioned teen Audrey Horne, Audrey's evil
father Benjamin Horne, drug-dealing trucker Leo Johnson and others
in the logging town.
   Here's what some members of Compuserve's Science Fiction and
Fantasy Forum had to say about the last episode of ``Twin Peaks'':
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On Who Killed Homecoming Queen Laura Palmer:
   Jim: ``Definitely not: Leo (He's probably dead.), Jacques (He IS
dead.).
   ``Probably not: Audrey (She's at OEJ's (a real insider's
reference to the brothel called One-Eyed Jack's).), Bobby (He's at
Leo's.), Shelly and Catherine and Pete (trapped at the mill), Ben
Horne (He's at OEJ's with Audrey.), Dale Cooper (bang bang!), James
(at the police station), Truman (same), Ed and Nadine (WHIRRRR goes
the ambulance...)
   ``Possibly: Jerry Horne? Where was he? And what about Leland?''
   
   Frank: ``It was either Leland or Irving the Wonder Llama.''
   
   Carolyn: ``Irving is definitely involved. I just know it.''
   
   Lisa: ``I vote for Irving. Although I still think Waldo (the
mynah bird) was the brains behind the operation.
   ``Does anybody else get the feeling that maybe Josie's husband
isn't as dead as she seems to think he is?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the shooting of FBI agent Dale Cooper in the final scene:
   Carolyn: ``Be calm, I just know agent Cooper was wearing a
bulletproof vest, and besides I read where Kyle MacLachlan has a
five-year contract with Lynch. So the bases are covered. Agent
Cooper will be OK.
   ``Now to the serious business. Who shot Agent Cooper and why did
he-she do it? Since we have all summer to come up with an answer I
think we should proceed thoroughly and cautiously.
   ``The first thing we need to do is figure out who CAN'T have
done it because they're dead or in jail or the hospital or
somewhere else ...''
   
   Lisa: ``OK, who can't have done it? Pete couldn't, he was
trapped in the mill. Andy couldn't, cause he was on the phone.
Where was Truman? Grilling James? And Bobby was busy watching Leo
get killed (or was he killed?). Maddie? Where was she? And we know
where Ben and Audrey were.
   ``Catherine was in the mill (maybe) with Shelly. Norma's husband
was busy killing Leo. Dr. Jacoby was busy having a heart attack (Or
maybe he was just faking it?). And where was Jerry all this time?
With his Nordic goddess? And what about Irving, huh?''

   On the wait until fall:
   Frank: ``It'll be a long summer.''
   Ron: ``But if they resolved everything, what would we have to
talk about all summer?''

   Daniel: ``Laura Palmer is not dead. Trust me.''

   The Navy reopened its investigation into the
USS Iowa explosion and ordered a halt to the firing of 16-inch guns
aboard all battleships Thursday after the ``unexplained ignition''
of bags of powder during testing.
   The new problems came during ``follow-up testing which the Navy
has been doing periodically as new theories were brought forward''
since the Iowa blast and the Navy's review of it, the service said.
   Last year, the Navy said the Iowa explosion ``most probably''
was an intentional act by gunner's mate 2nd class Clayton Hartwig
of Cleveland.
   Forty-seven sailors were killed in the April 19, 1989, explosion
during gunnery practice.
   The service accused Hartwig, who was killed in the explosion, of
placing ``some type of detonation device'' between the gunpowder
bags. The service said Hartwig was a ``loner'' who staged the blast
because he was upset over the breakup of a friendship with another
sailor, but admitted it only had circumstantial evidence for its
finding.
   Members of Congress and others attacked that conclusion as
unsupported by fact and called the Navy faulted the investigation
leading to it inadequate. Those critics said Thursday's
announcement showed they were right.
   Hartwig's father, Earl Hartwig, himself a Navy gunner's mate in
World War II, said in Cleveland: ``This is what we've been saying
all along. My son is not guilty. The Navy was barking up the wrong
tree.''
   ``This is a total victory,'' said Hartwig's sister, Kathy
Kubicina, who has devoted her life to clearing her brother's name.
   The Iowa's skipper at the time, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, blasted
the Navy's initial investigation in a speech at his May 4
retirement ceremony.
   Moosally said it was conducted by ``people more concerned with
`getting it over with,''' who used ``facts and opinions based on
unsubstantiated third-party information, unsubstantiated reports
and supposition.''
   ``As a safety precaution, the Navy today suspended all live
firing of battleship 16-inch, 50-caliber guns, until further
notice,'' the Navy said.
   ``The firing suspension is due to an unexplained ignition of
16-inch, 50-caliber powder bags during Navy testing at Naval
Weapons Station in Dahlgren, Va., today,'' the statement said.
   Pentagon sources said the Navy was informed several weeks ago
about test results conducted by the Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque, N.M., which indicated that the Iowa explosion could
have been caused by the over-ramming of the gunpowder bags.
   The General Accounting Office, the congressional investigating
agency, hired Sandia to evaluate the testing done by the Navy in
its initial investigation.
   Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., had
requested the follow-up testing, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark
Baker.
   Representatives from Sandia helped perform new tests Thursday.
   In the new experiment, five 96-pound bags filled with gunpowder
pellets were dropped vertically with weights on top of them,
recreating the tremendous forces that ram the bags into the chamber
of a 16-inch naval rifle.
   ``They were trying to recreate the conditions for a `fast
ram,''' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``On
the 18th try they got a detonation.''
   Because of the explosion at Dahlgren, ``the secretary of the
Navy has directed the reopening and continuation of the USS Iowa
investigation to incorporate the additional test data,'' the Navy's
statement said.
   Stability of the powder was one of the main points of contention
during congressional hearings into the Navy's earlier
investigation. Some family members contended that poor storage of
the powder had made it unstable. It was not immediately known
whether powder in the new tests was in similar condition.
   Dahlgren is located in the extreme northeast corner of Virginia
about 20 miles southeast of Washington.
   Nunn wrote the Navy on May 14 protesting the inactivity by the
service in light of a May 11 report from Sandia, according to a
copy of the letter made available by the source.
   The lab had conducted tests on 8-inch guns which showed that
when an over-ram occurred with powder pellets in their bags
oriented both horizontally and vertically, there was enough
friction to cause an explosion.
   Nunn's letter objected to the Navy's conclusion that the tests
were not relevant because they were not performed on 16-inch guns.
He asked that the service ``actively and expeditiously'' conduct
further tests.
   The Navy's announcement came as the GAO was scheduled to release
a report on the initial Navy investigation on Friday.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the report apparently
spurred the Navy to action.
   ``It's obvious that they know what's coming in the GAO report
and are trying to do that which we've been requesting them to do
for some time,'' he said. ``They are in an embarrassing position.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass,
said the new test development ``further erodes the Navy's theory
that Clayton Hartwig committed mass murder and suicide in the Iowa
turret.''
   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former secretary of the Navy and
senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said, ``It is
important to stress that we not leap to judgment ... it would be
wrong in my judgment to raise expectations and further cause
emotional stress to the familes'' before the Navy completes a
planned two weeks of additional tests.
   Congressional panels, in releasing an assessment of the Navy's
inquiry, faulted both the investigation and the conclusion's
``excess of certitude.''
   Two subcommittees of the House Armed Services Committee,
investigations and defense policy, said they found four major flaws
in the Navy inquiry: the structure of the investigation, technical
tests, police work and psychological analysis.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the technical and
criminal study, testified last year that additional technical tests
conducted since he issued his report found ``unique foreign
material'' on the projectile from the exploding gun barrel that
would not have been present during a normal firing.
   Tests identified the material as iron wires coated with calcium,
chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by ``some types of
non-electronic explosive devices,'' Milligan said then.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who represents the Hartwig family
and who has a copy of the GAO report, said Thursday it concludes
that, ``based on scientific fact, not on supposition,'' the gun did
not contain the foreign devices the Navy said it did.
   All four of the nation's four battleships are now in port _ the
USS Iowa and the USS Wisconsin at Norfolk, Va., and the USS New
Jersey and the USS Missouri at Long Beach, Calif.
   The Iowa and the New Jersey are to be retired this year to save
money, and the Iowa will not be repaired beforehand.
   The gun turret where the explosion occurred aboard the Iowa has
not been refired, although the other guns aboard the other
battleships have been tested since the explosion and found to be
safe, the Navy has said.
   Unattributed reports during the first Navy investigation tied
Hartwig's alleged suicide to despondency over the rejection of his
homosexual advances by a shipmate, Kendall Truitt. Truitt and
Hartwig's family have bitterly protested those reports.
   In Miami, Truitt's lawyer, Ellis Rubin, said he was pleased with
Thursday's news and his client ``stands ready to be a witness in
the new investigation and hopes this is the final step to restoring
his good name.''

   The father of the gunner's mate implicated by the Navy in the
explosion that killed 47 sailors on the battleship Iowa said
Thursday the Navy's decision to reopen an investigation into the
blast exonerates his son.
   ``This is what we have been saying all along. My son is not
guilty. The Navy was barking up the wrong tree,'' said Earl Hartwig.
   A Navy report on the April 19, 1989, gun-turret explosion said
gunner's mate 2nd class Clayton Hartwig of Cleveland ``most
probably'' caused the explosion intentionally.
   The Navy's findings issued Sept. 7 concluded that Hartwig was
disgruntled over his treatment in promotions and assignments.
   The Navy said Thursday it was reopening the investigation after
the ``unexplained ignition'' of bags of powder earlier in the day
during testing at a naval center in Dahlgren, Va., of theories
offered by Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico. No was injured
in Thursday's blast.
   Families of other Iowa victims also hailed the Navy's decision.
   ``I am happy to hear they were open enough to do that,'' said
Darleen Schelin from her home in El Toro, Calif. Her son, Geoffrey
Scott Schelin, died in the explosion.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog agency, is to
release a report Friday on the initial Navy investigation and
conclusions, based on research at Sandia.
   Hartwig's father said the pending release of the report forced
the Navy to reassess its earlier conclusion.
   ``It seems awful strange that the Navy pulled this now that the
lab findings are coming out,'' said Earl Hartwig, who was a Navy
gunner's mate in World War II.
   Kathy Kubicina, Clayton Hartwig's sister, who has devoted her
time to clearing her brother's name, called the Navy's announcement
Thursday ``total victory.''
   ``I'd like to hope that this will clear the doubts in anybody's
mind about what happened aboard the Iowa,'' she said from a pay
phone on the Pennsylvania Turnpike while en route to Washington,
D.C., for a Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing on the Iowa
blast.
   ``This is a tremendous sense of relief that we may finally get
to the bottom of this,'' said Nancy Lewis of Northville, Mich., who
lost her son Richard in the explosion and was traveling with Ms.
Kubicina to Washington.
   Ms. Kubicina has said green fragments found in some of Iowa
corpses would prove the gunpowder was old and more likely to
explode. The gunpowder on the Iowa had been stored on barges in
extreme heat and had started to turn green, a sign of
deterioration, she said.
   Sharon Ziegler, whose husband, Reginald Owen Ziegler, died in
the explosion, also said the Navy should look at the gunpowder used.
   ``My husband complained about the powder and he was upset that
there never was enough money to keep the equipment up,'' she said
from her home in Port Gibson, N.Y. ``I think it was an accident
waiting to happen.''
   Mrs. Schelin said she hoped the new investigation will be
unbiased.
   ``But it has re-established our faith that the Navy would do the
right thing,'' she said.

   The Senate voted Thursday to bar the execution
of mentally retarded individuals convicted of capital crimes under
federal law but leaders gave up hope of finishing work on an
omnibus crime bill this week.
   ``For God's sake, if you acknowledge you should not put children
to death, acknowledge that you should not put to death the mentally
retarded,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said as the Senate
debated the crime bill.
   Senators defeated 59-38 an amendment that would have limited the
death penalty protection for the mentally retarded to those who
don't know the difference between right and wrong.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had hoped to
complete action on the anti-crime bill before Friday's scheduled
start of a 10-day recess. But he abandoned that idea after 271
amendments were proposed.
   ``There's simply no way to proceed with action on this bill when
we face at least the possibility of several hundred amendments,''
Mitchell said.
   Lawmakers said the raft of amendments could stall the bill.
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said: ``It seems to me there is
great pressure from certain groups not to invoke cloture (limit
debate) and to kill the bill.''
   The Senate set a June 5 vote on whether to limit debate.
   ``If you don't get cloture, I think you bring it (the bill)
down,'' Biden told reporters. ``If you don't get cloture you just
declare the Republicans killed the crime bill.''
   The vote on the issue of the death penalty for the mentally
retarded came as President Bush urged Congress to approve ``a good,
strong anti-crime bill,'' but restated his opposition to curbs on
semiautomatic assault weapons upheld Wednesday by the Senate.
   Also Thursday, the Senate:
   _Dropped from the bill a provision to allow Death Row inmates to
base appeals on statistics showing a racial discriminatory pattern
within the jurisdiction they were sentenced.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., one of the critics, said the plan would
``have the practical consequence of repealing capital punishment
... because no jurisdiction can meet the standards of this
proposal.''
   _Reversed a Wednesday decision and adopted 52-46 a stringent
provision designed to cut short appeals by Death Row inmates that
can drag on for a decade or longer.
   The move was designed to cut short ``habeas corpus'' appeals.
Such appeals are filed after all others are exhausted and determine
whether trials and sentencings were carried out in a constitutional
manner.
   Critics of the proposal to protect the mentally retarded from
execution said virtually every defendant facing a death sentence
would claim to be mentally retarded. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
called it a ``soft ... liberal approach.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said that as a prosecutor a suspect
who claimed to have mental problems told him he enjoyed raping and
beating a woman.
   He said the suspect was later released and ``sliced his wife up
into 83 sections. ... These are people who are human only in the
sense of anatomical essence and they are bums.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he had strong feelings on
the issue because he has a mentally retarded sister.
   ``This is about the only democracy in the world that has the
death penalty and we're arguing about whether we're going to
execute the mentally retarded _ that says something about our
society,'' Kennedy said.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that mentally retarded people
may be executed in capital cases. Senators said the courts have
held that an IQ of 70 is the dividing line used to identify the
mentally retarded.
   The Senate's bill would apply only to federal cases and thus
would not reverse the Supreme Court's ruling as it applies to
capital punishment cases in state courts.
   Earlier, Bush told reporters at the White House that he ``sent a
crime bill to the Congress and would like to see it enacted as a
law enforcement bill.''
   ``Let's get a good strong anti-crime bill and then we can have a
debate about what they want to do'' on automatic weapons issues,
Bush said. ``The automatic weapon part does not have my support ...
and I wish the Congress would stop adding matters of this nature.''
   There is no similar legislation on the House calendar.
   Lawmakers said in the aftermath of Wednesday's vote that the gun
issue might not be settled.
   ``We've known for a long time we were going to have to deal with
anti-gun legislation,'' said Dole of Kansas, ``and I don't regard
(Wednesday's) vote as the final word.''

   The Edmonton Oilers defeated the Boston Bruins 4-1
on Thursday night, winning the National Hockey League championship
and their fifth Stanley Cup in seven years.
   The Oilers won four of five championship games, including all
three games in a compact Boston rink that was supposed to cramp
their flashy style.
   Edmonton won on goaltending by Bill Ranford, high-speed scoring
by Glenn Anderson and Craig Simpson and dazzling passing. The
slower Bruins were never able to catch up.
   It was another night of frustration for Boston's big guns. Cam
Neely, who had 55 regular-season goals, finished the series with no
goals and four assists.
   The Oilers, whose last Cup came in a 1988 sweep of the Bruins,
became the fifth team to win it five times.
   It was their first Cup without star center Wayne Gretzky, who
was traded to Los Angeles in 1988.
   The Oilers won the Cup in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988. With
Montreal winning in 1986 and Calgary in 1989, Canadian teams have
won seven consecutive Cups.
   Ranford won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff's most
valuable player.

   A tornado roared through central Kansas on
Thursday night, derailing a freight train, destroying farm
buildings and seriously injuring two people, authorities said.
   Other twisters were sighted in central Kansas and southeastern
Wyoming, the National Weather Service said, but there were no
reports of damage on injuries.
   Near Bushton, about 160 miles west of Topeka, four workers on an
oil rig spotted a tornado approaching and tried to outrun it in
their car. But the tornado caught the car, threw it into a farm
field and rolled it over several times, said Barton County Sheriff
Jim Daily.
   ``As the tornado was coming it just about beat us to death with
dirt,'' said worker Leland Hamby. He said he shut the rig down and
got in the car, ``and the next thing I know, I was in the field.''
   Two of the workers were seriously injured, Daily said. Officials
at Central Kansas Medical Center in Great Bend would not comment on
their injuries.
   The tornado derailed a Missouri Pacific Railroad freight train
two miles west of Bushton. Rich Van Noord, news director at radio
station KZXL in Great Bend, said he counted 67 derailed cars.
   ``Three cars were stacked on top of each other,'' he said. ``I'd
say it was about 20 to 25 feet high.''
   Downed power lines closed an eight-mile section of Kansas 4
between Claflin and Bushton for three hours.
   ``I'd say over 20 poles were snapped off,'' Van Noord said.
``One house was completely destroyed.''
   An Ellsworth County sheriff's department dispatcher said she had
received reports of farm damage near the Bushton area and other
reports of damage to electrical lines.
   ``We've been so swamped we haven't had time to write things
down,'' said the dispatcher, who refused to give her name.
   The tornado touched down shortly before 5 p.m. near Claflin and
moved east-northeast toward Bushton, said Travis Kershner, a
dispatcher with the Barton County sheriff's office.
   ``We've got a very large amount of damage,'' Kershner said.
   Officials at the Rice County sheriff's office in Lyons said they
were having trouble assessing the damage because of damage to
telephone lines.
   The weather service reported many more tornado sightings
Thursday night across central and east-central Kansas.
   Several tornadoes also were sighted in Laramie, Goshen and
Campbell counties in southeastern Wyoming, including one about a
quarter-mile wide at the base, the weather service said. But there
were no reports of damage.

   After more than a decade of stalemate,
Congress is close to sending sweeping clean air legislation to
President Bush.
   The House by a 401-21 margin approved pollution controls late
Wednesday on factories, automobiles and electric power plants. Most
of the most difficult disputes were worked out behind closed doors
with little floor debate.
   The Senate passed a similar bill in early April and a conference
committee is expected to work out differences, perhaps as early as
this summer.
   Wednesday's vote represented the first time in 13 years that the
House acted to revamp the 1970 federal clean air law, which
environmentalists for years have said is inadequate to rid cities
of dirty air or protect the public from toxic chemicals.

   All in the name of science, 24 young men sat
around a college dormitory for 3{ months and watched TV, played
cards and ate.
   And ate. And ate.
   When it was over, they had provided some of the clearest
evidence yet of one of nature's injustices: Some people can overeat
without putting on much weight. But for others, every extra calorie
goes straight to the waistline.
   Moreover, the study suggested a reason why. And it strengthened
the case that heredity plays a major role in whether people get fat.
   It seems that some people's bodies store extra calories mostly
as fat, while others tend to make new muscle. And because
manufacturing lean tissue is not a very energy efficient process,
the muscle makers put on less weight.

   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the Soviet

market economy, and must brace for high unemployment and inflation
during an expected two-year recession.
   ``Our decision is made. We have to move to the market,'' Ryzhkov
said in a nationally televised address to parliament in which he
catalogued the ills of the ailing socialist economy.
   Kremlin officials are proposing a radical five-year reform, and
they want the plan to be approved in the first national referendum
in Soviet history. No date has been set for the referendum.
   Ryzhkov, who blocked the Supreme Soviet parliament from passing
a plan for more rapid reform last fall, presented his plan to that
same body today. He said the economic transition should be made in
three stages.

government bailout in history.
   But some Democratic critics are questioning why it took so long
to come up with an accurate figure and wonder why the government

in the first place.
   The administration also left unanswered how to pay for the
higher bailout cost, leaving that question for the current round of
budget negotiations. Congressional and administration
budget-writers are looking for ways to reduce next year's federal
deficit to the $64 billion required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   Responding to demands for better figures on the S&amp;L issue, the

   The Rev. J. Lee Simmons isn't sure his
Operation Rescue followers are willing to ante up in their fight to
stop abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court raised the stakes.
   The high court Monday upheld a ban on Operation Rescue
demonstrations aimed at preventing women from entering New York
City-area abortion clinics. A week earlier, the court left intact a
ban on Operation Rescue blockades in Atlanta.
   ``There's a small handful determined to carry on no matter
what,'' said Simmons, head of Operation Rescue in central New York.
``But for the average guy in an office, or the homemaker with
children, the price is getting too high to pay. I own a house, I
have four children and a ministry, I can't afford big fines and
long jail sentences. Not many people can.''
   The rulings may force Operation Rescue to change its tactics but
are not expected to have a significant bearing on the abortion
debate, some observers say.

   The diehard Karen rebels have been
squeezed into shrinking frontier enclaves and may be down to the
last battles of their 41-year-old fight for autonomy.
   It has been a long, hard march for one of Burma's many ethnic
minorities, most of it backward. At the beginning, in the late
1940s, Karen troops swept through Burma's major cities and even
penetrated to the outskirts of Rangoon, the capital.
   In the past two years, the army has overrun most of the Karen
bases along the Thai border and sent 28,000 refugees fleeing across
the frontier.
   Thailand, eager to exploit Burma's rich forests, has struck
deals with the government at the expense of the rebels. Hundreds of
fighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat, sometimes
hand-to-hand.
   Among the last Karen strongholds is the border town of
Manerplaw, capital of territory the Karen call Kawtoolei.
   Manerplaw, probably one of the world's most idyllic guerrilla
bases, sits on the Moei River, at the foot of mist-streaked hills.
   Its neat wood-and-thatch buildings house 12 government
departments of the Karen National Union, including foreign affairs,
fisheries and mining. Karen leaders claim to command 10,000 troops
and govern 1 million civilians.
   The Karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnic
minorities with which they are allied do not seek independence, but
greater political and cultural autonomy.
   ``If you consider it historically, it is the worst situation we
have faced, but it doesn't mean the end of the Karen revolution,''
said Ba Thein, general secretary of the Karen National Union.
   He said the Karen were switching to more classic-style guerrilla
warfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of eastern
Burma dominated by the Karen minority. A ``mobile headquarters''
would be organized if Manerplaw fell to the Burmese, he said in an
interview.
   Ba Thein also expressed hope for internal political change in
Burma.
   ``We are not alone,'' he said. ``All the people in Burma are
struggling for freedom. We believe that, if democracy comes, all
the ethnic minority problems with be solved.''
   Burma's military, which brutally crushed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, has shown remarkable tenacity.
   The loss of border bases has greatly reduced the Karen National
Union's income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling, which was
used to buy weapons.
   In contrast, the 200,000-member Burmese military has restocked
its arsenal with funds from teak-logging concessions granted to
Thai businessmen.
   Burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerful
Thais, and rebel officers say some Thai-Burmese military
cooperation has occurred.
   ``The logging has been the death knell of the Karen,'' said a
knowledgeable Western observer in Bangkok. He noted that earlier
friendly and mutually advantageous ties between the Thais and Karen
had helped sustain the insurgency.
   What some sympathetic Westerners and Thais have called the
``sellout of the Karen'' fits a historical pattern.
   Although the Karen have lived in what is now Burma at least as
long as the Burmans, they have been suppressed and looked down upon
as ``savages'' and ``wild cattle of the hills.''
   The Karen fought bravely alongside the Allies in World War II,
while a pro-Japanese government sat in Rangoon, but promises of
some autonomy were broken when Burma gained independence from
Britain in 1947.
   After the early successes of their insurgency, the tide turned
against the Karen rebels and they were gradually forced into the
border region.
   There has been incompetence and some corruption among the aging
rebel leaders, who have not conducted a real guerrilla war, and
disparities in power and education between the Christian leaders
and their followers, most of whom are Buddhist or animist.
   In 1984, the government stepped up its campaign and three years
later announced it would destroy the Karen National Union within
two years. That has not happened, but two words often heard when
the rebels discuss the future are ``dark'' and ``bleak.''
   ``I am 63 and have fought all my life,'' Ba Thein said. ``My
children have now joined the revolution. Perhaps the next
generation will also have to struggle.''

<BYLINE>No Tom Cruise Now, But `Capt. Planet' Presses On
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Cruise, who last month urged Earth Day
celebrants in Washington to help save the planet, has dropped out
as television's Capt. Planet. A star-name setback, but noooo
problem.
   ``Capt. Planet and the Planeteers,'' Ted Turner's cartoon
eco-series, is pressing on, says Barbara V. Pyle, the executive in
charge of the 26-episode, $7.8 million project to alert kids to
dangers to the environment.
   Cruise was to be the voice of Capt. Planet, a green-haired
eco-hero who can be summoned by five youngsters of different races
and nations to fight various villains ruining the Earth.
   Alas, the star's busy film schedule ``just does not permit him
to be involved in a series production,'' says Pyle. ``He was
putting us too far behind, and so we lovingly and sadly parted
ways.''
   But production continues, as does a search for the star's
replacement.
   Previously announced stars such as Sting, Martin Sheen and Meg
Ryan still remain as the voices of such eco-villains as Zarm, Sly
Sludge and Dr. Blight.
   And Whoopi Goldberg, a show spokeswoman says, still is on as the
voice of a central character, Gaia, the Mother Earth who gives the
kids on the show magic rings containing the powers of earth, wind,
fire, water and heart.
   The shows are ``going to start popping off the cookie sheet in
July,'' says Pyle, a breezy Oklahoman and former free-lance
photographer who joined Turner's Atlanta-based cable empire when it
was just a small one back in 1980.
   The half-hour series, whose basic idea was conceived by Turner
and developed by Pyle and seven others, will premiere, with
commercials, on two fronts _ on local stations and Turner's TBS
SuperStation.
   Turner officials say the show has been sold to more than 100
stations for broadcast during kid-cartoon hours on Saturday
mornings. TBS, serving more than 50 million homes by cable, will
air it Sunday mornings.
   Pyle met Turner while working for Time magazine, covering the
1980 America's Cup races in which he and his sailing boat
participated.
   He hired her, she says, upon learning that she shared his
feelings on environmental issues, even though she knew nothing
about TV. Thanks to him, she now may now be the only environmental
executive at a television network.
   Since January, she has been TBS's vice president of
environmental policy. Before that, she made more than 16
documentaries for TBS on various global issues, many of them on the
problems posed by overpopulation.
   ``It was a tough road,'' says Pyle, who entered the
often-illogical world of TV armed with a master's degree in logic
from New York University.
   ``For a long time, people thought I was a real nut,'' she says.
``And they thought that my programming was going to bury the
station, with all this do-gooder stuff nobody wanted to see.''
   She isn't bothered that some cynics may say the same of ``Capt.
Planet,'' that it may not get the urchin audience at which it is
aimed and that messages disguised as cartoon entertainment just
won't lure the kids.
   She submits that the show will work, a motion seconded by a
veteran critic of the networks' Saturday morning kid shows _ Peggy
Charren, founder and president of the watchdog group Action for
Children's Television.
   ``I think it's a nifty idea,'' Charren says of ``Capt. Planet.''
   ``It's very much designed for that audience game that
broadcasters and advertisers play. But it has some meaning. And
it's designed to compete with all the junk.''
   Pyle grumbles good-naturedly when asked what it's like going
from documentaries to the world of cartoons.
   ``I've got chronic back pains from being a desk jockey and
flying back and forth from L.A.,'' she says.
   ``Give me the bush any day. But it's a sacrifice well worth
making for the effect it's going to have.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``COLOR'' MOVES TO NEW NIGHT: Fox Broadcast's half-hour ``In
Living Color,'' a very funny new sketch comedy series for which Fox
has ordered five more episodes, moves this weekend to Sundays at
9:30 p.m. EDT. That should get it a much larger audience than it
had on Saturdays, which usually is when the TV audience is the
smallest in number.
   In another move, the network says it will release its fall
schedule on Monday, Memorial Day, lest we forget.

<HEAD>The Theatrical Woes of London's West End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a city where the show usually goes on
regardless, the West End theater has been sponsoring an unusual
number of short-lived flops.
   The latest casualties are ``King,'' a musical based on the life
of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' inspired by the Anthony Burgess novel. Both
will close on June 2 with a combined loss of more than $5 million.
   Producers blamed poor attendance and bad reviews, although
critics in London are generally much less influential than in New
York.
   A spokesman for ``King'' called the reviews ``unseemly and
damaging.''
   These closings follow the premature demise this month of such
diverse West End entries as ``Never the Sinner,'' John Logan's play
about the Leopold and Loeb murder case in 1920s Chicago; ``Look
Look,'' Michael Frayn's first new play since ``Benefactors'' in
1984; and ``Bus Stop,'' a revival of the William Inge play,
starring model Jerry Hall.
   The musical ``Someone Like You,'' with Petula Clark, shut on a
Thursday afternoon, April 26, after a scant five weeks when
producer Harold Fielding was forced into liquidation.
   Normally, London shows must announce their closings a minimum of
two weeks before the final performance. The sort of overnight death
knells so prevalent on Broadway rarely happen here.
   The fate of ``Look Look,'' which closed May 12 after a
month-long run, was a particular surprise. Frayn is one of
Britain's most respected dramatists. Its star was Stephen Fry, a
popular local TV personality. But in an interview with London's
Sunday Times, Frayn said he understood the critical reaction.
   ``I actually feel embarrassed for the critics,'' he said of the
comedy, which lost its $420,000 outlay.
   ``I don't think the play failed because it is too intelligent,
but because it isn't intelligent enough.''
   Clare Fox, producer of ``Never the Sinner,'' said her show was
bedeviled by such English anomalies as a heat wave and a riot.
   ``We did open in the middle of a riot, which is very un-British,
as you know,'' said Fox.
   Referring to the anti-tax demonstration on March 31, which
filled much of the theater district with rampaging protesters, she
said: ``I think it frightened people; everybody's box office
dropped away.''
   Fox said ``Never the Sinner'' was playing to 25-percent
capacity, half the break-even figure. It cost $320,000.
   So far, 1990 has fielded only two substantial commercial hits:
Peter Ustinov's one-man show, which was extended one month through
May 27 at the Theater Royal, Haymarket, and Alan Ayckbourn's new
play, ``Man of the Moment.''
   Otherwise, London's hottest tickets continue to be such musical
holdovers as ``Miss Saigon,'' ``Aspects of Love,'' ``The Phantom of
the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables.''

<TEXT>
   He once was the man of the hour, the
latest strongmen installed by the army to lead Guatemala out of
corruption, insurrection and bloodshed.
   Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a born-again Christian with a
charismatic style, presided over times of masked tribunals and
firing squads, of army massacres that shocked the world.
   When a coup deposed him in 1983, after 16 months as president,
Rios Montt seemed consigned to political obscurity.
   His ambition, like his faith, has been resurrected and he is
running for president as a civilian. Rios Montt is a serious
contender scoring high in the polls, a candidate of crisis.
   Five years of democracy have not brought clean, effective
government or ended violence and human rights abuses. Street crime
is rampant, drug trafficking on the rise, the economy unraveling.
   ``It is a moral crisis, an ethical crisis, a failure of hope,''
said Juan Luis Bosch, a leading businessman. ``People put their
hope in a democratic government, but hope has become
disillusionment.''
   Things seem to be spinning out of control and Rios Montt offers
to put them right. He is a law-and-order candidate with an Old
Testament style, stern and paternal.
   ``Guatemala needs a man of character, a man who knows and
enforces the law,'' the 63-year-old retired brigadier general said
in an interview. ``Not a dictator. A man of law.''
   Rios Montt's law was harsh.
   He imposed a state of siege and created special tribunals where
masked ``judges'' tried hundreds of people for crimes including
sabotage, possession of explosives and the sale of weapons to
people deemed subversive.
   ``Only 15 people were ultimately sentenced to death, but it was
a great scandal because we shot five when the pope was here,'' Rios
Montt said.
   Pope John Paul II made a personal plea for clemency during his
1983 Central America tour.
   ``It would have been easier to shoot them and just dump them in
the trash, but that wouldn't have been justice,'' Rios Montt said,
curtly closing the subject.
   During his presidency, the army continued a vicious
counterinsurgency campaign to destroy any potential base of support
for leftist guerrillas among the peasants.
   It led to ``the gravest violations of human rights ... including
the destruction and sacking of entire villages and massacres of the
inhabitants,'' the human rights commission of the Organization of
American States said in 1983.
   Now, an almost nostalgic glow seems to bathe Rios Montt's reign;
the worldwide condemnation of human rights abuses seems forgotten.
   ``You talk to the average person here about human rights and it
means getting on a bus and not being robbed,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``That is what makes Rios Montt's message so powerful.''
   People speak of how his stern measures seemed to work, how the
army's scorched-earth campaign in the countryside dimmed the
leftist insurgency, how city streets were safe and official
corruption waned.
   ``He is seen as an upright man, a person of principles and
order, someone who will end the violence and corruption,'' said
Fernando Hurtado, deputy attorney general for human rights. ``He is
someone who, in a time of crisis, stresses values.''
   Central America's most populous nation seems caught in a time
warp. Turn on television and there is Rios Montt again, talking
about law and order, the family and clean government, just as he
did in evangelistic Sunday homilies as president.
   More than half a dozen candidates are seeking the presidency,
encouraged by the vulnerability of the incumbent Christian
Democrats, who are widely seen as corrupt and inept.
   Rios Montt is running as an independent. Political observers say
they detect little solid support for him in the two most powerful
segments of Guatemalan society: the army and business.
   ``I have the support of the people,'' he said in the interview.
``That is what matters.''
   The most serious obstacle to his candidacy is a constitution
that appears to bar former dictators _ heads of ``de facto''
governments _ from becoming president.
   Rios Montt says the 1985 constitution is not retroactive and he
will run despite an adverse advisory opinion from the
Constitutional Court. The opinion was requested by the legislature
and is not binding.
   The former general predicted his followers will start a civil
uprising if election authorities refuse to let him register when
they meet in June to set an election date and register candidates.
   ``It will be the people, not the army,'' he said. ``An army
uprising doesn't interest me. Coups don't interest me.''
   He grabbed a well-thumbed copy of the constitution, with key
passages highlighted in yellow ink or underlined in red, and
thumped a clause he says makes such an uprising legal.
   ``It says here that people have the right to defend their
rights, and they have a right to vote for me,'' he said.
   His interest in constitutional law is relatively new. One of his
first acts after a March 1982 coup put him in power was to revoke
the 1965 constitution, suspend political activity and cancel
election laws.
   Rios Montt, a member of the Church of the Word, based in
California, says he does not intend to revive the special tribunals
or military rule. Instead, he proposes an extensive system of
locally elected judges.
   ``No more tanks, no more planes, no more soldiers,'' he said.
``More justice.''
   His human rights record could make him unacceptable to many
other governments if he becomes president.
   Publicly, the United States is neutral. Privately, U.S.
officials say aid might be cut if Rios Montt wins.
   Rios Montt said his election could provoke a U.S. invasion or
assassination attempt.
   ``Do something like Panama. Shoot me. End everything,'' he said,
spitting out the words.
   Rios Montt's administration was the last but one in a 30-year
line of military or military-dominated governments that began with
a U.S.-sponsored coup in 1954.
   He dismisses criticism of his army's counterinsurgency campaign,
echoing former President Reagan's comment in 1982 that the general
got a ``bum rap.''
   ``They blamed me for what Lucas did, but they knew I had an
honest government,'' he said, referring to his predecessor, Gen.
Fernando Romeo Lucas.

<HEAD>Tensions Within Solidarity Burst Into Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders who worked together for
a decade to rid Poland of communism now find their unity rent by
differences over the pace and nature of change.
   The spectacle of this ``war at the top,'' to use Lech Walesa's
phrase, has dismayed activists. Some are choosing sides and others
hope to make peace between the factions.
   Walesa, who led the 1980 strike in which Solidarity was born,
brought the long-rumored tensions into the open in April.
   His method was public criticism aimed at the government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the parliamentary caucus led by
Bronislaw Geremek. Both are intellectuals and Solidarity advisers
who owe their positions to the shipyard electrician from Gdansk.
   Walesa said he had been silent too long. He accused the
government of advocating a ``steered democracy,'' one that limits
dissent, because it thinks it has all the answers. He said the
Communist system was being dismantled too slowly and people were
dissatisfied.
   ``Walesa feels the mood of the people very well and the people
are getting impatient,'' especially for political changes, said
Zdzislaw Najder, whom Walesa has named chairman of Solidarity's
national Citizens Committee.
   Mazowiecki's defenders say Walesa is motivated by personal
restlessness and an ambition to be president. They say his
criticism threatens to stir unrest when the government needs calm
to obtain Western investment and accomplish difficult economic
reforms.
   ``No reasonable person can see any monopolization of power,''
Aleksander Malachowski, a Solidarity member of Parliament, said in
an interview, but added that some ``demagogues'' sought excuses to
attack the government.
   ``Very often in (Walesa's) statements you can see reflections of
this demagoguery,'' Malachowski said. ``He probably does not
realize it.''
   The dispute seems to signal a turning away from the 1989 ``round
table'' accord in which Solidarity agreed to a transitional stage
of coexistence with the Communists, who still held most of the
power.
   With the collapse of Communist control throughout Eastern
Europe, Poland has become a rarity where former party leaders
retain titular positions of power, including the presidency and
high posts in the military, police and Parliament.
   They have kept their places largely by not disturbing the
decisions of Mazowiecki and the Solidarity parliamentary caucus.
   Walesa speaks for those who want to end the artificial
arrangement as quickly as possible. Mazowiecki's allies worry about
upsetting a balance that has worked so well.
   While Walesa says ``the intellectuals'' misled him, some of them
hint he is losing his renowned political instincts.
   ``You are making mistakes in many areas,'' foreign affairs
specialist Kazimierz Wojcicki lectured the Solidarity chairman May
13, in a stormy session of the Citizens Committee.
   ``You use terminology that confuses us,'' he said. ``You start a
presidential campaign and then retract it. ... You make us all
nervous at a moment when our economic reforms are entering a key
stage.''
   There also has been sniping between the daily Gazeta Wyborcza
and weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc, two newspapers founded by
Solidarity. They are edited, respectively, by Adam Michnik, an
intellectual perhaps best known for his ``Letters from Prison,''
and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a Walesa loyalist.
   Who will succeed President Wojciech Jaruzelski has become the
subject of sometimes acrimonious debate. It is assumed the former
Communist Party chief will have to step down before the formal end
of his term in 1995.
   Walesa clearly wants the job and Kaczynski has organized a
political group called the Center Alliance to support the candidacy.
   From the other side, suggestions are being circulated, sometimes
even printed, that Walesa is too impulsive and does not have the
learning or manners the presidency requires.
   Malachowski and some others in Parliament and the government say
Mazowiecki, who was little known until Walesa made him prime
minister in August, is a better presidential candidate.
   How could people who fought and suffered so long together, with
the notion of ``solidarity'' as their highest value, fall out so
soon after their hour of triumph?
   In part, the dissolution of their common foe, the Communist
Party, has released various conflicts within Solidarity:
left-right, worker-intellectual, Warsaw-provinces.
   ``Now the most difficult moment has come, because we don't have
anyone to fight against,'' actress Maja Komorowska said at the May
13 meeting.
   ``We are all victims of 45 years of Communist rule and of the
lack of democracy,'' said Najder, who recently returned from exile.
``We know how to fight our enemies, but we don't know how to
coexist as allies.''
   He also said in an interview he felt the differences between
Walesa and Mazowiecki were blown out of proportion.
   ``We have democracy, but when there are differences of opinion,
people are aghast,'' he said. ``If somebody criticizes the
government, they think he or she wants to bring down the
government. ... It's absurd.''
   At the same Citizens Committee meeting where he spoke of the
``war at the top,'' Walesa praised the government and the
Solidarity leadership in Parliament, Najder said.
   Walesa said his criticism was meant to help the government by
providing a safety vent for growing public frustration.
   According to Najder, the dispute developed because Walesa is in
close touch with public feelings and wants to create a ``more open
political game'' by opposing ``monopolistic tendencies'' in
Parliament.
   He said government leniency about pensions for former officials
and its mild attitude on recovering property taken by the Communist
Party were ``incomprehensible'' to some Solidarity supporters.
   The government also may be guilty of ``excessive sensitivity,''
Najder said. The returned exile, a former director of Radio Free
Europe's Polish section, was sentenced to death in absentia by the
Communist regime.
   Malachowski, who wants Walesa to continue as Solidarity chairman
instead of becoming Poland's president, said years of joint
struggle had forged links among Solidarity activists that
``occasional arguments'' could not break.
   Mrs. Komorowska, the actress, said the relationsship between
Walesa and the intellectuals should be like a marriage, and
observed:
   ``It is a bad marriage where the couple does not sit down at the
table in the evening and say to each other what is painful.''

<HEAD>Despite Weakness in the Union, Gorbachev Remains Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy is in shambles. Republics erupt in
explosive ethnic quarrels; others try to secede. Comrades squabble
over what is to be done _ and do nothing.
   Yet Mikhail S. Gorbachev not only survives but is championed
around the world as a hero of epic proportion.
   In the five years of his reign, he has ended the Cold War, taken
the first steps toward nuclear disarmament, pulled his army out of
Afghanistan and begun the withdrawal of Soviet troops from foreign
soil. Tens of millions of his countrymen and millions more in the
former Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe have been freed
from totalitarian rule.
   ``I think he is more popular abroad than he is at home,''
observed a Soviet teacher who recently returned from her first trip
to the West,
   Indeed, Gorbachev is no hero to many Soviets understandably
preoccupied with the issues of everyday life: the food and ordinary
goods they can't buy; the critical housing shortage that denies
them simple comfort and privacy; the rising crime rate and ethnic
strife that make them fearful for their families and meager
possessions.
   He has pleaded futilely with Lithuanian officials not to declare
their independence and has been jeered _ to his fating market forces revamp
the economy. It is said that Poland
shortened the painful transition period of high unemployment and
runaway inflation by moving swiftly after the fall of the communist
government there.
   But the Soviet plan to try something similar leaked to the
press, touching off an outcry from a fearful public. Gorbachev and
other top officials later denied they would attempt such a radical
move.
   Last week, Gorbachev's advisers approved a milder reform plan
that envisions a doubling of food prices, an 82 percent rise in
energy costs and an average 43 percent rise in retail prices _ but
only if the public supports it in a national referendum.
   Absent public support, ``perhaps we will have to resort to
round-table discussions'' to devise a plan that would be supported,
First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov said at a news conference.
   He said the government was not proposing ``shock therapy''
changes because such reforms could throw 40 million people out of
work and ``would lead the country to the edge of an economic
crash.''
   Some Soviet citizens reacted with apathy to the announcement,
others with emotion. A 65-year-old woman said, ``I have been
suffering all my life.'' Another woman said the reforms would make
food so expensive that ``I'll have to put my teeth away on a
shelf.''
   Gorbachev is in a tough position as head of the Communist Party,
said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of the Higher Party School in
Moscow. ``In the party, everyone _ from the right wing, from the
left wing _ is criticizing him.''
   But Shostakovsky, a leading member of the Democratic Platform
group that is pushing within the party for faster reform, added
that as president, Gorbachev retains the support of a broad
centrist element in the country, despite the sharp criticism of him
from the more radical wings of his own party.
   A peasant by birth and a product of the Communist system,
Gorbachev has demonstrated repeatedly he is quite capable of taking
one position based on traditional ideology, then abandoning it in
the face of popular discontent. He did that in being converted to
legalization of private ownership of factories, the ``means of
production'' that classical Marxists insisted were tools of
exploitation unless held by the state.
   It sometimes even appears he has helped fuel the public's demand
for change. After stubbornly resisting calls for a multiparty
system, he accepted the idea, then gave at least tacit support to a
huge demonstration through downtown Moscow to increase pressure on
the party leadership to go along.
   While calling constantly for perestroika, or economic
restructuring, Gorbachev often defines the debate with radicals on
both sides opposed to him. He thus makes adoption of his reform
proposal appear to be the centrist position.
   Through adroit political maneuver, Gorbachev now sits
comfortably atop both the party and the government. His adversaries
on the right, led by Yegor K. Ligachev, a spokesman for doctrinaire
communism, no longer hold positions of power. His most vocal critic
on the left, Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, is waging a
campaign for the presidency of the Russian republic, which would
give him a new soapbox but little administrative authority over the
vast territory that forms the largest of the union's 15 constituent
republics.
   After giving in to popular demands that the Communist Party
surrender its monopoly, Gorbachev led a drive this spring to
legalize competing parties and simultaneously establish a strong
presidency, a post he then handily won for himself in a clear
demonstration of political clout.
   As the party inevitably loses its command over daily life,
Gorbachev can continue to rule from his new power base at the top
of the government.
   The president and his supporters are fond of saying there is no
alternative to perestroika. For now, at least, the same might be
said of perestroika's champion.
   ``The country can't do without Gorbachev now,'' said Lidya
Sharlai, who raises pigs on a collective farm outside Moscow. ``In
a few years, perhaps. But right now, there is no one else.''

   When Nikita Khrushchev heard he'd been invited
to Camp David, he was afraid it might be the kind of a place where
``stray dogs were sent to die.''
   But the Soviets have learned a lot about America since
Khrushchev and Dwight Eisenhower forged the short-lived ``spirit of
Camp David'' in 1959.
   Mikhail Gorbachev accepted President Bush's invitation to the
hideaway with no apparent misgivings. The Soviet president will be
there for a few hours Saturday before flying to Minneapolis.
   Gorbachev will be the third Kremlin leader to visit the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. Leonid
Brezhnev met there with Richard Nixon, who found Brezhnev a
dangerous driver on the camp's narrow, winding roads.
   Since it opened as Shangri-La in 1942, the presidential retreat
has been visited by several foreign leaders, including British
prime ministers from Winston Churchill to Margaret Thatcher.
   Churchill visited Franklin D. Roosevelt there, summing up the
retreat as, ``in principle, a log cabin with all modern
improvements.''
   It was Eisenhower who introduced the rustic retreat to
high-profile world politics by inviting Khrushchev to meet with him
there.
   ``I couldn't for the life of me find out what this Camp David
was,'' the Soviet leader wrote in his memoirs.
   After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, he said, the new
Kremlin's leaders had been invited to a place called Princess
Island, where ``stray dogs were sent to die.''
   ``I was afraid Camp David was the same sort of place, where
people who were mistrusted would be kept in quarantine,'' he wrote.
``Not even our embassy in Washington could tell us for certain what
Camp David was.''
   After finding out, Pravda told its readers that the mountain
compound ``would seem to have been created for fruitful reflections
by nature itself.''
   The talks resulted in an agreement to hold a four-power summit
in Paris, but what was called the ``spirit of Camp David'' quickly
foundered on revelations of U.S. spy flights over Soviet territory
and the Paris summit was canceled.
   Khrushchev and Eisenhower watched a Western movie at the
presidential lodge in the evening after the Soviet leader told the
president that he shared Ike's fondness for such films.
   British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, visiting the camp
earlier the same year, also had been treated to a Western, ``The
Big Country.''
   ``It lasted three hours!'' he wrote in his diary. ``It was
inconceivably banal.''
   French President Charles de Gaulle and leaders of Canada,
Australia, Indonesia and other countries also have visited the
camp, which is 1,800 feet up in the mountains and 60 miles
northwest of Washington.
   When Brezhnev came to the retreat in 1973, Nixon presented him
with a dark blue Lincoln Continental donated by the manufacturer,
Ford Motor Co.
   As Nixon told the story in his memoirs, Brezhnev quickly jumped
into the driver's seat and invited his host to join him. By the
time the Soviet leader got the car up over 50 miles an hour, on
roads posted for 15, Nixon was shouting at him to slow down.
   During the Carter administration, the retreat was the scene of
the 13-day conference that produced the Camp David accords, which
led to the Israeli-Eqyptian peace treaty and a framework for
further talks on Middle East peace.
   The 1988 conference of President Carter, Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was the longest
international get-together ever held there. Begin dubbed the place
a ``concentration camp deluxe'' after his foreign minister, Moshe
Dayan, went for a walk around the perimeter and reported back on
the forbidding security fence that surrounds it.
   President Reagan did not entertain foreign visitors overnight at
the Catoctin hideaway, but did have Mrs. Thatcher to lunch there.
   It was still true, as Eisenhower said in 1959, that ``for some
reason, an invitation to Camp David had come to confer a special
distinction upon a guest.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that carved a niche for low-rollers
in the nation's high-stakes gambling capital now presents the
world's largest hotel in the form of a castle.
   The June 19 opening of the $290 million, 4,032-room Excalibur
Hotel will mark a milestone for Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.
   The company, which started with a struggling Strip hotel-casino
16 years ago and now values itself at $1.6 billion, has become the
envy of the gaming industry with a strategy focusing on family
entertainment.
   The giant castle at the south end of the glitzy Las Vegas Strip
is the brainchild of gaming executive William Bennett, who amassed
a personal fortune of $500 million catering to Middle America's
gambling tastes.
   The Excalibur is anchored by four, 28-story towers and covers
more than 70 acres. It will replace two other Las Vegas properties
that have held the title of the world's largest hotel.
   The Las Vegas Hilton held the record with 3,174 rooms, according
to the Guinness Book of World Records. That figure was eclipsed in
recent weeks when the Flamingo Hilton opened a new wing, giving
that Strip resort 3,530 rooms _ and brief claim to the title. The
new Mirage Hotel here just missed the mark with 3,054 rooms.
   Bennett and a former partner, William Pennington, bought the
Circus Circus hotel-casino in 1974 after the late billionaire
Howard Hughes kept raising the ante on their first choice, the
Landmark Hotel. Today, the Landmark is struggling, while Circus
Circus has become an industry giant.
   ``At the time, I thought the Landmark was the best of the two
properties,'' Bennett said in a rare interview recently. ``I think
I was wrong. I lucked out.''
   The 65-year-old Bennett owns 18.2 percent of the public company,
which had revenues of $522 million last year.
   When the Excalibur opens, parent Circus Circus will have a total
of 11,320 rooms in Nevada, including two hotels in Las Vegas, one
in Reno and two in Laughlin. By comparison, Atlantic City's 12
major hotels total 8,100 rooms.
   The Excalibur will give Las Vegas 75,000 hotel rooms.
   ``The new room count will give Las Vegas almost twice that of
Manhattan's 47,000 rooms, with Circus Circus-owned properties
offering 11 percent of the total room base in Las Vegas,'' said
Excalibur general manager Bill Paulos.
   Even Bennett's vivid imagination couldn't have dreamed up the
scenario that evolved from his purchase of Circus Circus. He was
forced, because of the nature of his original property, to target
families rather than high-stakes gamblers.
   When Bennett bought the Circus Circus hotel-casino, it was a
gaming mishmash _ catering to high-rollers as well as families with
kids.
   ``It was awful,'' Bennett recalled. ``They had children's things
mixed in with the gaming. They had bumper cars where we now have
the keno lounge.''
   Midway games included one in which players tossed balls at a
target, trying to knock a scantily clad woman out of bed.
   Bennett and Pennington wanted the Landmark, but the eccentric
Hughes, who owned several Las Vegas hotels at the time, raised the
price from $15 million to $16 million, then jumped it to $20
million.
   Bennett and Pennington passed.
   After settling for Circus Circus, they built a separate midway
section for kids away from the gaming and provided free circus acts.
   The success of Circus Circus has nudged Las Vegas toward other
family-oriented features, transforming the gaming capital into what
local promoters like to call a ``total resort destination.''
   ``The Excalibur will not be as family-oriented, but there will
be plenty of things for everybody,'' Bennett said. ``The rooms will
be more expensive (an average $45 per night, compared to $33 at his
other properties). It will be a more ostentatious setting. It's a
definite upgrade.''
   The Excalibur casino will offer gamblers higher limits and may
provide gaming credit _ something that's taboo at Circus Circus.
   The castle's 500,000 square feet of entertainment space includes
a Renaissance-era village, 12 food outlets and a casino the size of
four football fields, with 2,630 slot machines. Shows will feature
a medieval flair, with live jousting. Diners in the Great Hall, a
900-seat amphitheater for floor shows, will feast without utensils.
   Other attractions include an arcade with archery and other
themed game booths, strolling minstrels and a Sherwood
Forest-inspired wedding chapel.
   Off the theme will be a pair of motion-simulator theaters
recreating an Olympic bobsled ride, roller coaster, runaway train
and a frantic ride down an icy mountain road.
   Keeping the enterprise moving will require a staff of 4,300.
   The giant castle with its towering spires is in contrast to most
of the glitzy showplaces along the Strip.
   ``I've had in my mind for six or seven years to build a
castle,'' Bennett said. ``I had decided our presence in Las Vegas
was just not big enough. I thought the only way to build a
successful property was to build a big property.''
   Bennett studied old renderings of castles, then made several
visits to castles in England and Germany with staff members to soak
in the architectural and environmental detail.
   ``We came up with more than 20 ideas that wouldn't step on the
toes of the Disney people,'' he said.
   Company officials hired trademark experts to ensure their ideas
didn't clash with Disney castles at theme parks in California and
Florida.
   The Excalibur was built mainly with cash the company had on
hand. It sits on 77 acres of a 117-acre tract the company bought
several years ago. Bennett says the company may end up building on
the remaining 40 acres.
   ``We're already thinking about what's next,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   George Bush's second get-together with Mikhail
S. Gorbachev shapes up as a summit of lowered expectations.
   There will be no treaty signed to limit long-range nuclear
missiles, no announcement of a dramatic increase in trade between
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Other differences also will be felt: Moscow's resistance to
German unity, its pressure on rebellious Lithuania to rejoin the
Soviet fold, and the slow pace of talks to call home hundreds of
thousands of troops and tanks from Europe.
   An agreement will be signed to destroy chemical weapons and a
statement will be issued announcing limits on cruise missiles, an
important step toward a broader treaty cutting the deadliest
weapons in the superpowers' arsenals.
   But much of the three days of talks will be given over to
discussing issues on which the superpowers are at loggerheads.
   ``We've got a lot of things to discuss that might not result in
a signed agreement,'' Bush said last week, adding, ``There's
enormous problems that just need to be talked about.''
   Yet, he told reporters, ``I don't want to have two ships pass in
the night, the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Recognizing the two leaders' fondness for springing surprises,
many experts believe that something unexpected will emerge from the
summit _ but probably nothing earthshaking.
   ``They are almost compelled to pull one or two rabbits out of
the hat but they're going to be fairly small rabbits,'' predicted
Robert W. Tucker, a Soviet specialist at the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies.
   ``The administration always `low balls' summits,'' said Robert
Hunter, a Soviet expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ``It's the Nw Hampshire primary syndrome.''
   Possible steps toward progress include further compromises for a
pact covering long-range nuclear missiles, where differences
already have been narrowed significantly, or pledges to revive
slowly moving negotiations on a treaty to slash the superpowers'
European armies and stores of conventional arms.
   Tucker said the real importance of the summit is that it
continues the string of superpower meetings.
   ``It's part of the long and complicated and arduous process of
winding down the Cold War and the differences that remain between
us,'' Tucker said.
   Aside from striving for progress in arms talks, Bush will press
Gorbachev to allow a united Germany to be a part of the U.S.-led
NATO alliance.
   ``At stake,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III, ``is
the reconciliation of a people and of a continent too long divided
and the future of a legitimate and stable European order.''
   Yet, Moscow has refused _ at least publicly _ to budge from its
opposition to a united Germany in NATO, fearing a shift in the
balance of power in Europe.
   Bush will press Shevardnadze on the pace of negotiations in
Vienna aimed at reducing the U.S. and Soviet forces and
conventional arms in Europe.
   As the president said Thursday, ``The talks haven't gone as far
or as fast as I would like to see. ... Maybe we can find some way
at the summit ... to move CFE (the talks) forward.''
   The Bush administration feels Moscow has slowed the pace of the
discussions on a Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, in part,
because it wants the large West German army scaled back.
   On this issue, there may be signs of movement.
   Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Moscow ``advocates an acceleration in the Vienna negotiations.'' He
rejected the notion that Moscow's concerns over the West German
army have made his government hesitant to sign a CFE agreement.
   Moreover, West German officials who met with Shevardnadze say
they think the U.S. assessment of Soviet concerns may be a
misunderstanding.
   Lithuania also promises, in Bush's words, to put ``some tension
on the summit.''
   Baker said recently that ``a good bit'' of the president's time
will be spent discussing the moves by Baltic states to become
independent of the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's pressure to keep
them in the fold.
   Gorbachev, facing tests of his power at an important Communist
Party Congress in July, likely will be unwilling to give up too
much to Bush, experts say.
   ``Gorbachev's playing a very weak hand but he's playing it so
well he's made himself look like an equal,'' said Hunter.
   ``His objective is not to humiliate the president but to be seen
as a member of `The Club.' It's Bush's interest to be as
forthcoming with Gorbachev as he can, while Gorbachev is doing what
we want him to do,'' Hunter said. ``They have a mutual interest in
success at this summit.''
   Gorbachev is interested in any help Bush can offer for the
battered Soviet economy. But that help, at least for now, won't
include the trade concessions that once had been expected from the
Bush administration.
   The United States will not grant the Soviet Union preferential,
most-favored-nation status because the Soviet legislature has not
passed legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration.
   U.S. law prohibits the president from granting such concessions
to any nation determined to be denying its citizens the right to
leave.
   On the other hand, Bush recently loosened restrictions on sales
to Moscow of high-tech products such as computers and precision
milling equipment.
   The two presidents also will discuss the unfulfilled efforts to
sign a treaty limiting strategic arms.
   While Bush and Gorbachev will declare their intention to reduce
the numbers of their long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and
submarines by one-third, the formal agreement they once had hoped
to sign is not even close to being ready.
   Gorbachev arrives in Washington Wednesday evening as a leader
enjoying widespread popularity on the international stage but
strapped by immense problems at home.
   His economy is wrecked. His nation is torn by nationalist
uprisings. His far-flung communist empire virtually is gone.
   By contrast, Bush remains high in the public opinion polls and
deals from a position of strength even though he is wrestling with
difficult deficit problems.
   Yet, Bush does not want to undermine Gorbachev or push him from
power because he has been the champion of Soviet reforms and
allowed Eastern Europe to break free from Moscow.
   Despite his problems, Gorbachev appears in control.
   ``Whether we like what he is doing, whether we are unhappy with
what he is doing, the buck in the Soviet government today stops
with him,'' said Dimitri K. Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
   Beginning Thursday, Bush and Gorbachev will hold two days of
talks at the White House. On Saturday, they will retreat to the
privacy of Camp David for a day of discussions on troublesome
political issues.
   It is at the presidential retreat, Bush said last week, that he
expects he and Gorbachev ``can sit and talk'' about relations
between the two superpowers.
   The summit will end Sunday morning, when the two leaders hold a
wrap-up news conference in the chandeliered East Room of the White
House.
   The planned showpiece of the summit will be the signing Friday
evening of the agreements to destroy chemical weapons and clamp
long-sought limits on air- and sea-launched cruise missiles.

<HEAD>Controversy Ahead on Bush's China Decision</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the cost of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
dolls from China probably won't be going up, there may be an
increase in the political price of President Bush's policy toward
Beijing.
   It could be avoided if there was a gesture from the Chinese
government to match the administration's move to maintain trade
preferences, but there is no sign of that.
   Democratic leaders, and some Republicans, too, are lining up for
a congressional challenge to Bush's decision to continue the
favorable trade terms that have applied to China since 1980. It is
one Bush almost certainly can withstand, just as he blocked by veto
an earlier attempt to toughen sanctions against China for the
repression of democracy demonstrators.
   Even so, his critics have the politically salable side; as the
president said himself, there is an ``impulse to lash out in
outrage that we all feel.''
   This time the issue is the annual decision on extension of most
favored nation trade terms toward China, due on June 3 _ the first
anniversary of the massacre of demonstrators in Tienanmen Square.
   As Bush said in announcing his decision on Thursday, most
favored nation treatment is not a special favor or concession, it
is the treatment extended to almost every trading partner. It means
that no other nation will be extended better tariff and trade
terms, and the United States applies it to all but a handful of
countries.
   But it applies to Communist nations only if the administration
certifies that they permit their citizens to emigrate freely, and
that determination is subject to annual renewal. The Soviet Union
does not have most favored nation status because its emigration
laws do not yet meet the requirement. China's do, Bush said.
   But Bush critics insist the status should be denied China to
punish human rights abuses. Bush says that would hurt the wrong
people, and only make things worse, isolating China and damaging
the economy of Hong Kong.
   Congress could overrule his decision by adopting a disapproval
resolution within 60 days. But that would be subject to veto, and
it would take two-thirds votes in each house to override Bush.
   U.S. imports from China totaled about $12 billion last year,
with most of that trade moving through Hong Kong. China buys about
$6 billion a year in U.S. products.
   Chinese imports would be subject to sharply increased U.S.
tariffs without the most favored nation status. The duty on toys,
for example, would go from 12 percent to 70 percent.
   That's where the Ninja Turtle dolls come in; Hong Kong traders
cite that big seller as an example, saying that an end to the
current trade status would boost the price from $5 to $9 apiece.
   Bush said some opponents of his earlier decision to impose only
limited sanctions against China agree with him this time that the
favorable trading status should be continued.
   But some of those converts had said the renewal should be
conditional and accompanied by a firm demand for human rights
reform. The administration said the law didn't provide any way to
make the extension provisional.
   Bush said China had taken modest steps, including the release of
211 people arrested in the democracy demonstrations and the lifting
of martial law in Tibet.
   ``While we welcome these and earlier steps they are, lets face
it, far from adequate, and I am not basing my decision on the steps
that the Chinese have taken so far,'' Bush said. ``Most important
of all, as we mark the anniversary of Tienanmen, we must realize
that by maintaining our involvement with China we will continue to
promote the reforms for which the victims of Tienanmen gave their
lives.''
   Bush said the only message in his action is that isolation is
bad, economic involvement good.
   His critics see another message.
   ``The hope for freedom in China is as remote today as it was 10
months ago,'' said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, ``and what is worse, the administration has signaled to
the Chinese leadership and the watching world that it views their
actions with complacency.''
   Mitchell said Bush's policy has been secretive, inconsistent
``and its outcome has been dismal failure.''
   Administration policy over the year since the clampdown and
killings in Beijing has been one of limited sanctions that Bush
said remain basically unchanged. But there has been a gradual
easing of those strictures on trade and international loans.
   Shortly after Bush announced the suspension of high-level
exchanges of top officials, two of his senior aides went secretly
to Beijing. They went back in early December, while their July trip
remained secret, even from Mitchell and the other congressional
leaders they briefed on the second trip.
   Congress passed a bill to extend the visas of about 30,000
Chinese students studying in the United States. Bush vetoed it,
saying he would do the same thing by executive order. Instead, he
did it with guidelines for immigration authorities, putting it into
an executive order this spring.
   The difference is largely symbolic, but symbols are part of the
message.
   ``We continue to have serious concerns about the human rights
situation in China ... ,'' Bush said Wednesday in a report to
Congress, which had asked for an account of the impact of U.S.
sanctions.
   The report skirted the question, saying the impact was difficult
to measure precisely.
   Precisely or imprecisely, nobody has come up with evidence of
real results.

<HEAD>Cultural Conflict Pits Arab Grocers Against Chicago Blacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's a cultural conflict rooted in the dreams of
new Americans hoping to scale the economic ladder and the
frustrations of impoverished blacks unable to get even a toehold on
its lowest rung.
   Tensions between blacks and the Arab immigrants who have set up
shop on some of Chicago's meanest and poorest streets have festered
for years.
   The conflict is not unique to this city _ some blacks in the
Flatbush area of New York are boycotting two Korean grocers because
a black woman said she was beaten by a grocer _ but even by Chicago
standards, the bitterness has reached a new low.
   The tensions worsened this spring when a West Side grocer placed
a sign in his window: ``This store is being remodeled. No Arabs
will be involved.''
   The ward's alderman, a black, was asked by the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee to intervene but declined. If that
makes Arab-Americans angry, Alderman William Henry said, ``that's
too bad.''
   Henry later retreated, quietly asking the white owner of Buddy
Bear's grocery to remove the sign. Even so, 16 of the store's
windows were smashed before the sign came down, about three weeks
after it appeared.
   Mayor Richard Daley declared the whole business a disgrace and
ordered a City Hall investigation. And a group of blacks and
Arab-American shopkeepers now meets regularly on the West Side
seeking ways to co-exist peacefully.
   But no one believes the problem is near a solution. In the past
12 months alone:
   _A black has sued an Arab-American grocer, alleging he was
beaten and his nose broken by workers at the West Side store during
an argument.
   _Henry proposed a city ordinance that would have required all
grocery store owners to speak English, saying he was tired of
shopkeepers who can ``count money (but) can't say thank you in
English.'' The ordinance was later revamped _ minus the language
requirement _ and is languishing in committee.
   _A group of black ministers on the South Side has organized a
``buy black'' campaign. ``We said don't get mad, get smart. Learn
to control your own economy,'' said the Rev. Hiram Crawford.
   Arab-Americans say they are doing a service for residents of
impoverished, often dangerous, communities long abandoned by the
supermarket chains.
   ``Arab grocers are in those black communities because all the
big grocers have left,'' said Fadi Zanayed, head of the
Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, which estimates as
many as 1,000 small stores in the city are run by Arab-Americans.
   The city's two largest food chains have 69 stores in
predominantly white neighborhoods but just nine in the largest
black areas, according to a survey by the Chicago Reporter, a
monthly that focuses on racial issues.
   Residents complain the smaller shops charge higher prices for
substandard, sometimes spoiled food and sell it under security so
tight it makes customers feel they are under siege.
   ``They come in and board everything up like its a prison,'' said
Crawford. ``They make you stand in a small area. These (stores) are
degrading the community.''
   Zanayed said higher prices are a function of the smaller
quantities purchased at wholesale by the merchants and the high
insurance premiums charged to stores in high-crime neighborhoods.
   Strict security is necessary, Arab-American merchants say.
   ``On Saturday, I catch three people stealing in my store,'' said
David Farhan, who runs a grocery and liquor store with his son,
Billy.
   The Farhans bought American Food &amp; Liquors six months ago on a
desolate strip of Roosevelt Road in the Lawndale neighborhood. The
store sits among abandoned buildings, storefront churches and empty
lots littered with debris.
   While the problems the Farhans face are considerable, they say
they have no regrets.
   ``We have good relations with the people,'' Billy Farhan said.
``We're satisfied.''
   So is Fred Mohamed, who beat a neighborhood boycott 18 months
ago to make a success of his Giant Foods.
   Unlike the Farhans' store, Giant Foods is in a stable, black
middle-class neighborhood. But when Mohamed took over a store that
had been abandoned for months, he met significant community
resistance.
   ``They didn't want us here. ... We were Arabs and they didn't
want Arabs in the neighborhood,'' he said.
   He eventually signed a covenant with the Chatham-Avalon Park
Community Council agreeing to employ blacks and do his banking in
the neighborhood, and gradually, he said, things have improved.
   ``Everything they wanted, we were going to do anyway,'' he said.
``I think I'm past the worst of it. There are feelings that linger.
   ``I was just upset that the whole thing started without them
even knowing me,'' he said. ``That my last name was Mohamed just
seemed to ignite this animostity towards the store.''
   Mohamed's case may be an exception, however.
   ``The base issue is that as long as many of the stores in the
ghetto are owned by outsiders ... you're going to have that
tension, frustration and anger,'' said Richard Taub, a University
of Chicago social science professor who has studied small business
development.
   ``Frustration runs on both sides. Store owners find it difficult
to make a living in a poor community and sometimes act overzealous
and obnoxious. On the other hand, groups that have to deal with
them feel angry that it's outsiders that own the stores and they
don't.''
   Jesse Miller, a black Democratic ward committeeman on the West
Side, echoes a widespread contention of blacks that they are denied
the financial resources provided by banks to other ethnic groups.
   ``There's clear evidence that these institutions do not create
the same support for black entrepreneurship that they have for the
others,'' he said. But the Arab store owners in Chicago and the
Koreans in New York say they get very little, if any, help from
banks.
   ``The only people that I know that get loans are the people that
have been in business already, because the banks don't give you
money unless they know they'll get their money back,'' said Nayel
Abdullah, owner of A&amp;B Food Market.
   He said he bought the store with his savings from driving a cab
for seven years and loans from relatives and friends. He tried to
get a bank loan seven or eight months ago, but was turned down, he
said.
   ``I think if you look closely, you'd discover Korean and Arab
groups have access to credit through informal credit pools _
family, people in their community,'' said Taub. ``There just aren't
enough black businesses out there.''
   Miller said that in his Lawndale neighborhood, where more than
40 percent of the population is below the poverty line, residents
are working to set up informal credit networks to help black
business people make a start.
   ``I believe the community itself must seek out ways by which it
can support entrepreneurship by local citizens,'' he said.
   In the Chatham neighborhood, ministers of at least five churches
are encouraging their congregations to patronize black businesses
exclusively.
   ``We've made every ethnic group in our community wealthy,'' said
Crawford, minister of Israel Methodist Community Church. ``We're
just waking up.''

<HEAD>Farmers Face Dwindling Supply of Leaded Gasoline for Tractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CONNIE CASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have added another problem to
their list of worries _ where to find leaded gasoline for old but
serviceable tractors.
   ``We know that in a few years it will virtually disappear from
the market,'' said Martha Casey, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. ``I don't know how that market is
going to turn out for farmers.''
   Major refineries and most service stations no longer sell
gasoline containing lead, which the EPA has been trying to phase
out for the past decade. Major refineries quit producing leaded
fuel because of the EPA's tougher pollution controls and declining
demand.
   But leaded gasoline still is needed to run tractors, grain
trucks, combines and other farm machinery bought in the '70s or
before. Using unleaded gasoline can damage the engines, an EPA
study found.
   The majority of heavy farm work is done by diesel-powered large
tractors and combines. The situation remains serious, however, for
small farms and bigger operations that use light tractors for some
work, said Gary Huddleston, information director for the Kentucky
Farm Bureau Association.
   Based on a 1985 questionnaire, the Federal Farm Bureau
Federation estimates there are an average of 10 engines per U.S.
farm that use leaded fuel, said Jim Porterfield, associate director
of the federation's environmental division.
   ``Nearly half of the farmers said they want to continue using
those engines for another 10 or 15 years at least,'' Porterfield
said.
   ``It puts us in a difficult position. It will impose some
hardship,'' said Mike Crouse, who was told his supplier would no
longer have leaded fuel for two tractors he uses to farm 166 acres
near Dixon, Ky.
   Making things more complicated, the EPA requires service
stations that sell gasoline containing a phosphorous-based
additive, but no lead, to label the fuel as ``leaded.'' Farmers may
not realize they aren't buying fuel with lead, which is needed to
lubricate and protect valve seats in older truck and tractor
engines.
   EPA studies of additives marketed to make unleaded gasoline safe
for older engines have been inconclusive.
   Crouse said he cannot afford to replace the valve seats on his
tractors, which would enable them to accept unleaded gasoline. The
work would cost several hundred dollars, he said.
   The situation varies from state to state.
   Indiana farmers should have less trouble than some finding
leaded gasoline because the Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative
Association's refinery will provide more of the fuel as supplies
dwindle elsewhere, said Ronald Stover, vice president of the
co-op's petroleum division.
   ``Our leaded gasoline sales continue to increase although the
market is shrinking overall,'' he said. ``We've gained about 7
percent per year in the farm market during the last couple of
years, when most of the majors dropped out.''
   But in some areas of Kentucky, there is no leaded fuel
available, Huddleston said.

<HEAD>Shift to Unleaded Gas Causes Lead in Soil to Decline</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Farm Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The switch to unleaded gasoline may have
saved large tracts of trees in Northeastern forests.
   Scientists a decade ago feared that the buildup in soil of lead,
which is toxic, would damage and possibly kill trees. But 15 years
after the Clean Air Act forced automakers to market cars that burn
unleaded gasoline, scientists say lead concentrations in the forest
floor already are falling.
   ``It's beautiful, the curve showing the decline of lead,'' said
Thomas G. Siccama, a forest ecologist at the Yale University School
of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
   ``It has left the forest floor faster than the general community
of ecologists thought,'' Siccama said.
   In 1980, Siccama and two other scientists, William H. Smith of
Yale and Donald L. Mader of the University of Massachusetts,
documented that from 1962 to 1978 lead levels in surface soils in
Massachusetts had jumped from 682 milligrams per square meter to
1,160 milligrams.
   Siccama, Smith and others, including Andrew J. Friedland of
Dartmouth College and Arthur H. Johnson of the University of
Pennsylvania, began looking more closely at the surface soil of
forests, taking samples from Pennsylvania through New Hampshire.
   Over the past year, they and other researchers have begun to
review the extensive data collected.
   At one test site, the Cathedral Pines forest in Cornwall, Julie
Tritschler, a Yale graduate student, found lead has fallen since
1980 from 1,275 milligrams per square meter to 940 milligrams.
   At Hubbard Brook in West Thornton, N.H., lead levels in 1975
approached 1,100 milligrams per square meter. By 1988, they had
fallen to under 800 milligrams, Siccama said.
   What is happening, Siccama believes, is that over time the lead
is being diluted in the underlying soil.
   Michael J. Kellett, Northeast regional director for the
Wilderness Society, said the data was encouraging. But he cautioned
that it is important to learn where the lead is going because it
might end up in underground water supplies.
   Siccama and others say the decline in lead levels in soil is
almost certainly due to the mandated use of unleaded gasoline in
new cars beginning in 1975.
   ``That was the whole point of the law,'' Siccama said. ``It is a
one-on-one connection. We know it has gone down in the rain, and
we've followed it going down in the soil where we knew it was
accumulating.''

<HEAD>Marine Scientist Asks Lab's Help in Her Undersea Quest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oak Ridge National Laboratory may
hold the key for a voyage to the bottom of the sea.
   Marine scientist Sylvia Earle, a veteran of 50 deep-sea
expeditions, wants to make the trip. No mere skin-diving trek, Ms.
Earle's quest is a plunge into the deepest part of the ocean _
seven miles down.
   Her husband, Graham Hawkes, has designed a new type of
submersible vessel that looks more like an X-15 airplane than a
submarine to take her there.
   Unlike the heavier-than-water vessels of the present, Hawkes'
design calls for a buoyant vehicle able to swoop into the deep and
back.
   ``To be able to fly under water is the vision,'' Ms. Earle said.
   Hawkes and Ms. Earle, with the help of volunteers at their San
Francisco company, are building an early version of the design,
called Deep Flight. They hope to launch it in August or September.
   But even if the one-person craft meets expectations, the
limitations of its composite hull, which makes it buoyant, will
only allow it to scratch the depths _ about 4,000 feet.
   To go 35,000 feet down will require new technologies in hull
design.
   ``Where we come in is that we have the advanced materials
technology that enables you to carry those very high compression
ratios, those crushing pressures at deep ocean,'' said Oak Ridge
engineer Ray Garvey.
   ``We've demonstrated the ability to make a hull that is lighter
than water for a four-mile depth,'' said Garvey, the lab's program
manager for structural composites.
   The lab has developed a fabrication process for a composite
material of graphite fibers that is stronger than steel at a
fraction of the weight.
   The April issue of Popular Mechanics magazine reported the lab's
graphite composite hull was successfully tested in an unmanned Navy
probe.
   Garvey refused to connect the government lab's research with the
Navy vessel. But he said, ``What we have demonstrated is the
ability to get most of the way there (to the ocean's bottom) and
the track that leads from here to there.''
   Garvey invited Ms. Earle to Oak Ridge recently to address the
lab's staff on her long-term goal, called the Ocean Everest
project, and to tour the facilities.
   The visit was also intended to challenge the engineers and
persuade Department of Energy management of the potential of the
Earle-Hawkes project, Garvey said.
   Ms. Earle told her audience there is a popular misconception
about how much is known about life in the sea. ``We are just
beginning to explore this planet, just beginning to know it from
the inside out.''
   Only once before have people reached the bottom of the sea. That
was in 1960, when Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard and Navy Lt.
Donald Walsh rode in a steel ball called the Trieste to the bottom
of the Marianas Trench. They stayed 20 minutes.
   ``It was really quite an amazing feat,'' Ms. Earle said. ``What
is more amazing, however, is that here we are 30 years later and
nobody has been back.''
   Ms. Earle wants it to see it happen again, and again.
   ``The key to that is here at this institution,'' she told the
Oak Ridge researchers. ``The materials do exist, the technology
exists, the expertise exists. What has to come together is the will
to make it happen.''

<HEAD>One-day Flower Endangered, or Just Hard to Spot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is the Bartram's Ixia, a wildflower that
blooms for less than a day but once a year, so rare that it should
be listed as endangered? Or is it a common plant that's just hard
to spot?
   Researchers have been trying to answer the questions since a
controversial proposal last year to include it on the federal list
of endangered species.
   During a recent survey of land owned by Georgia Pacific Corp. in
Putnam County, company forester Phillip Parker said he found
thousands of tiny purple Ixia plants on at least a dozen sites.
   ``I'm not qualified to say whether the Ixia is truly endangered.
But if you have this many in other parts of northeast Florida,
we'll have a really large number of plants,'' Parker said.
   His survey was part of a cooperative effort this spring between
the forestry industry and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to
find out how rare the Ixia is.
   Surveys previously have been hampered by the Ixia's fickle
nature. The plant's seeds can lie dormant for years until some
disturbance, notably fire, causes them to germinate.
   The plant then looks like any other grass until it flowers. And
that occurs only in the morning in May or early June. An Ixia
flower lasts only one day before it shrivels.
   Timber companies, who worry that placing the Ixia on the
endangered list could change their tree farming practices and keep
them from using herbicides, say the plant is abundant on their
private lands.
   Those lands, they say, were not surveyed by federal biologists
who proposed the plant for the endangered list.
   The timber industry has successfully forced a delay in the
decision on the Ixia listing until fall to allow the current survey.

   Coyotes are moving south.
   ``They are established in Florida, there's no doubt about
that,'' said Jim Brady, biological administrator with the state
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission in Gainesville.
   The night predators with the eerie howls are becoming frequent
sights _ or sounds _ in northwestern Florida, and are moving south.
A 1983 survey, the state's first, found coyotes in 18 of Florida's
67 counties. The southernmost sighting was Orlando. A second survey
completed late last year found coyotes in 48 counties.
   ``In the future, you can expect the numbers to continue to go
up,'' said John Wooding, wildlife biologist with the Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. ``They'll also be more widespread.''
   State officials haven't estimated the number of coyotes.
   The coyotes, once mostly limited to the Western range, moved
across the country and into Canada and Mexico with the help of
hunters and people who wanted them in their woods to kill rodents
and other pests.
   Coyotes live in suburban Los Angeles, 30 miles north of
Manhattan and, as of last year, only 50 miles northwest of Miami.
   Some wildlife biologists are intrigued by the way coyotes are
increasing in areas where population booms are pushing out other
animals.
   ``I kind of get a kick out of seeing them and hearing them,''
said Brady, who conducted the state's first study.
   The red wolf died out in Florida early this century.
   ``We've been without a predator this size for 70 or 80 years,''
Wooding said. ``To a lot of people, a predator this size in the
system is good. It balances things out.''
   However, the coyotes are not welcomed by many residents.
   Morgan Richardson, a state wildlife biologist based in Panama
City, thinks people blame coyotes for attacks on animals that
actually were carried out by dogs.
   But farmers have complained that coyotes killed farm animals.
   State Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner said he's been
forced to fence in the lambs on his 1,000-acre Jefferson County
farm.
   ``Anything that goes slipping arund in the dark, killing little
lambs, is a pretty lowlife critter,'' Conner said.

   President Bush's son Neil told a congressional

   Neil Bush, who served a year on the board of directors of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver, told the
House Banking Committee Wednesday that allegations of conflict of

   The Bush administration dramatically boosted
its estimate for rescuing the savings and loan industry, saying the
government will need to borrow $90 billion to $130 billion to clean
up the S&amp;L mess.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in an appearance before
Congress Wednesday, blamed the slumping real estate market for
bloating what was already the largest government bailout in history.
   It was the first time the administration has acknowledged that
the $50 billion in borrowing authority in last year's S&amp;L bailout
bill would not be enough.

<HEAD>GM Holds Shareholder Meeting; Executive Pensions Up for Debate</HEAD>

   Chairman Roger Smith will bang the gavel for the
last time at General Motors Corp.'s annual meeting Friday and,
perhaps fittingly, the occasion won't be without controversy.
   Shareholders will decide whether Smith's annual pension should
double to about $1.1 million.
   Smith retires July 31 after heading the world's largest
industrial corporation for 9{ years and watching over a big loss of
market share.
   The proposal comes as the company is resisting efforts by its
union workers to win inflation protection for their pensions in
this summer's contract talks.
   Not surprisingly, union officials are incensed by the plan. But
so too are some of the company's big shareholders.
   As a result, the issue of executive pensions could make this
year's gathering more exciting than typical annual meetings.
   Shareholder proposal No. 4 calls for modifications in some
retirement plans that would increase sharply benefits for GM's
3,350 top-ranking executives.
   Basically, it would change the base for figuring pension
payments from salary alone to salary plus bonuses. Pension plans
for Ford and Chrysler Corp. executives are based on salary without
bonuses.
   The program will cost GM about $42 million a year, and that
galls Michigan state Treasurer Robert Bowman.
   He says the state's pension fund will vote its 8.8 million GM
shares, just over 1 percent of the total outstanding, against the
proposal.
   ``Offhand, I can think of three better uses: product
development, plant modernization, and the workers' pension system
is underfunded,'' he said. ``I think all three of those are better
uses of the money.''
   The 20-member GM board, which includes six company executives,
proposed the adjustment. It said the current plan's retirement
provisions, compared with total compensation, ranks in the lower 20
percent of all pension programs.
   Dale Hanson, chief executive officer of the California Public
Employees Retirement System, said his organization would vote its
6.2 million shares in favor of the proposal, but he questioned the
timing.
   GM and the United Auto Workers union begin talks on a new labor
agreement a few weeks before Smith retires.
   Union members vigorously opposed the pension proposal.
   ``It was not only ill-timed, but showed exactly where the
company is at in terms of greed and the way they're running the
business,'' said Sam Isaac, a member of the UAW's GM national
bargaining committee from Local 651 in Flint.
   Despite their differing view, Bowman and Hanson praised GM for
bringing the matter to shareholders. The board could have changed
the formula without seeking shareholder approval.
   ``Say what you will about it,'' Bowman said, ``but you can't
call them anything but candid and up-front about putting it up
before the voters.''
   Bowman said he expects the plan to pass.
   During Smith's tenure, GM's share of the U.S. car market tumbled
12 percentage points to 32 percent, the company laid off tens of
thousands of workers and shut down factories. For three years
beginning in 1986, it finished second to Ford Motor Co. as the
most-profitable U.S. automaker.
   Also during Smith's tenure, GM embarked on an extensive
plant-modernization program, expanded ties with overseas automakers
and slashed costs to stay competitive not only with Ford but with a
half-dozen Japanese automakers.
   Eleven other proposals, ranging from South Africa relations to
space weapons, are on the agenda Friday.

<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union is taking
a surprisingly moderate, pro-management agenda into negotiations
with the Big Three automakers this summer, an analyst says.
   Negotiators for the union will sit down with executives of
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. during the
first two weeks of July. All of the Big Three contracts are up
Sept. 14, the first time since 1979 that they have expired at the
same time.
   About 2,000 UAW members meeting at the union's bargaining
convention approved a 120-page book of dozens or resolutions that
will serve as a guide for bargaining committees.
   ``I was struck by the degree of moderation and the degree of
overlap with management,'' auto analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. said Wednesday, a day after the two-day meeting ended.
   The convention was a quiet one, and the one potentially divisive
issue _ indexing pensions to the cost of living _ was dispatched
relatively quickly by UAW President Owen Bieber.
   In his opening speech, Bieber outlined five broad priorities for
UAW bargainers: job security, wage improvements, maintenance of
health-care benefits, pension improvements and making management
more accountable to workers.
   ``I think management and labor are united in a more competitive
industry,'' Merlis said. ``It's because of the pressure of the
(Japanese) transplants and the lack of (trade) protection from the
government that the UAW is moderating their wage demands in favor
of job security.''
   Before the Japanese manufacturing invasion of the United States
started in 1982 with Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s factory in Marysville,
Ohio, the UAW pushed hard for wage and benefit improvements. But
when the Big Three's collective market share began to be eroded by
Japanese imports and later U.S. built vehicles, the companies began
looking for ways to cut costs.
   That meant plant closings and layoffs, shifting the UAW's
priorities to holding the jobs they had. Membership in the nation's
largest industrial union has dropped to about 1 million from 1.5
million in the late 1970s.
   This year's negotiations will key on job security.
   ``It was one thing when the competition was over there,''
analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said. ``But when the
competition started living in the house next to them, all of a
sudden things struck a little closer to home.''
   Current contracts with the UAW permit plant closings only when
products made at the factory suffers a sales slump. GM and Chrysler
have used that clause to justify closing eight assembly plants and
forcing the layoffs of 17,000 employees during the past three years.
   The UAW challenged the closing of one of the plants, GM's Fiero
assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., but lost in a decision by an
arbitrator. The union has fine-tuned the focus of its plant-closing
arguments.
   ``We must compel them to retain all current workers unless their
ability to survive is severely at risk as a result of conditions
beyond their control,'' Bieber said in a convention speech.
   While job security will be the top job for UAW bargainers, they
are going to have to pay attention to the 446,000 retirees carried
on pension rolls. Most of the debate at the UAW convention centered
on providing cost-of-living adjustments for retirees.
   But although members are demanding inflation protection for
pensions, Bieber knows, as automakers have said, that it is
extremely expensive. Some estimates put the cost at more than $1
billion a year for the Big Three.
   If such a proposal were adopted, some have contended, other
contractual benefits would be cut.
   Bieber told delegates he didn't want bargaining committees
handcuffed by proposing a cost-of-living adjustment as the only
inflation hedge for retirees. He easily carried the day.
   ``What struck me about the demands is that never before have we
had so much potential for easy agreement when it comes to
pension,'' Merlis said.
   ``The leadership ultimately has to be responsive to the rank and
file,'' Merlis said. ``And with the lack of dissidents, the odds of
a meaningful strike becomes much less likely.''

   North American-made car and light truck sales in
mid-May lagged 17.7 percent behind last year's slow pace, and
dealers said dwindling incentives were hurting showroom traffic.
   An auto industry analyst said the slowdown was a sign of
people's worries about the country's, and their own, economic
security.
   ``More than at any time since 1981, I think auto sales are
directly influenced by what the consumer is feeling about the
economy,'' said Ann Knight of PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   The Big Three automakers said Wednesday that car and light truck
sales dropped 21.9 percent for the period, compared with mid-May
1989. That was partly offset a 52.9-percent gain in sales of
transplant cars, those built in North America by Japanese makers.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their average daily vehicle sales slowed to 28,983 in the May 11-20
period from 37,126 a day in mid-May last year.
   At the same time, combined sales of the cars made domestically
by Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and Subaru rose to a daily average
of 3,041 from 1,989 a year earlier.
   Overall, sales of North American-made cars dropped 19.3 percent
and trucks dropped 15 percent.
   After production cuts earlier this year trimmed inventories to
match slow demand, manufacturers generally were offering lower
rebates _ and on fewer models _ than in mid-May 1989.
   Len Gossman, sales manager at Blackwell Ford in Plymouth, said
sales dropped to a slow but steady pace after late-April
announcements that incentives were being reduced.
   Gossman said he hoped new rebates on some models, including
Ford's two-door Probe, would lure people back to showrooms after
Memorial Day. ``Our guys are waiting for them to come in.''
   Bob Morris, sales manager at Avis Ford in Southfield, said brisk
orders for new Escort compact and Explorer sport utility vehicles
kept him out of the slump and Probe sales were picking up. ``It's
spring and that's a sports car.''
   For the year to date, Big Three vehicle sales trailed last
year's by 7.6 percent. Car sales lagged 10.6 percent and truck
sales were 2.8 percent behind.
   GM said its mid-May car sales were down 23.7 percent and truck
sales dropped 16.7 percent, a 21.4 percent combined decline. For
the year to date, GM said car and truck sales were running 4.3
percent behind last year's.
   Ford said car sales slumped 29.9 percent and truck sales dropped
12 percent for the period, a 22.9 percent drop overall. Ford said
car and truck sales for the year thus far were 9 percent behind
last year's.
   Chrysler's car sales dropped 22.1 percent and truck sales slid
21 percent for mid-May, a combined 21.6 percent decline, while its
year-to-date sales dropped 13.6 percent.
   Some transplant makers, which continued to gear up domestic
production, showed sharp increases. Honda was up 22.4 percent for
mid-May and 16.2 percent for the year. Toyota stepped up sales of
domestically made Camrys and Corollas 117 percent for the period
and 108.6 percent for the year.

<HEAD>World's Largest Furniture Retailer Causes Traffic Jams On Turnpike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden's IKEA brought its low-pressure,
low-price furniture retailing formula to the New York City area by
opening its fifth and biggest U.S. store.
   Analysts said the company's amiable atmosphere has proved
successful for the world's largest furniture retailer elsewhere.
The early signs on opening day _ which was preceded by a massive
media blitz _ were positive in this town just west of New York City.
   Thousands of shoppers stormed the blue-and-yellow store the size
of seven football fields _ IKEA's largest outside Europe. Cars
nearly filled its 1,800-car parking lot by the 9 a.m. opening and
traffic was backed up for more than a mile on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
   ``IKEA creates a festive shopping experience, which is
antithetical to most shopping forays,'' said Ivan S. Cutler, retail
editor of Furniture-Today magazine.
   IKEA's customers wander through 100 furnished rooms to look at
sample kitchens, bedrooms or living rooms, and then fill out an
order form for the stock number of their favorite sofa, chair or
table. There are no commission-seeking salespeople.
   Customers ``don't have to bare their design soul,'' said Cutler.
   The Elizabeth store features supervised playrooms for children,
as well as a restaurant and shop featuring Swedish delicacies such
as lingonberries, herring and Swedish meatballs.
   IKEA has more than 80 stores in 20 countries, and the privately
held concern posted $2.3 billion in 1989 sales, with 85 percent
from Europe.
   Wednesday's opening was part of a worldwide expansion.
   IKEA President Anders Moberg said the company expects its
greatest expansion in Eastern Europe, with 15 to 20 stores in the
next six years.
   Nevertheless, the company plans to open two or three stores a
year in the United States.
   It intends to surround the New York market with a second store
to open in Hicksville, on New York's Long Island, in spring 1991. A
site in Westchester County, north of the city, is being sought.
   With the addition of a store in Burbank, Calif., in the fall,
IKEA could double its 1989 U.S. revenues of $130 million, 15th
among all furniture retailers in the United States, Moberg said.
That expansion could hurt existing retailers, especially in the
ready-to-assemble market, he said.
   ``We are competing for the same market, so there will be some
losers,'' Moberg said.
   But Neil Stern, a partner in McMillan-Doolittle, a Chicago-based
retail consulting company, said IKEA was more likely to draw
customers from many different areas and not hurt any single
competitor too severely.
   IKEA saturated northern New Jersey and New York City with
advertising including three weeks of television ads, 300
billboards, 1,250 bus and subway panels and 133 full pages of
newspaper ads in New Jersey alone.
   Not everyone was thrilled, however.
   One billboard message to New Jersey Turnpike drivers was ``On
May 23, find a place to crash on the New Jersey Turnpike.''
Turnpike officials asked the company to take down some of the
signs, said Gordon Hector, a spokesman for the highway.

   Pinnacle West Capital Corp.'s annual meeting took
on some aspects of the wild West as shareholders roasted management
for big losses, the dropping of dividends and the rejection of a
takeover offer.
   During the rowdy session Wednesday in which some shareholders
called for top officials to resign, new chairman and chief
executive Richard Snell acknowledged the company problems but said
he had laid a clear recovery path.
   Snell said the company nearly foundered last year because of its
four-year ownership of MeraBank, a $6 billion thrift taken over by
the government in January.
   The poor performance of the three-reactor Palo Verde Nuclear
Generation Station also hurt results at Pinnacle West's main
subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Co., he said.
   ``I ask for your clear understanding that there is a new
administration here, one which is not beholden to the prior one and
which will function somewhat differently and whose mistakes will be
its own,'' he said.
   Snell, who took over Feb. 5 from long-time CEO Keith Turley,
stepped into a company that lost $551.4 million last year and had
to restructure $676 million in debt to borrow money to get rid of
MeraBank.
   Many of the more than 1,000 shareholders at the meeting ignored
his plea to wait for his program of cost containment, improved
nuclear operations and debt reduction to take root.
   Holders who expected reliable dividends from a utility-holding
company called for for the resignations of directors Turley and
Carl Eller because of the company's decision last October to omit
quarterly dividends.
   Turley left the room without commenting after the meeting but
Eller told reporters he had no intention of resigning.
   ``I have been on the board a long time, and I have contributed
as much as I can,'' said Eller. His expansion of Circle K Corp.
drove the convenience-store chain to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on May 15, just eight days after Eller resigned as
Circle K's chairman and chief executive.
   At one point, Snell was booed for defending management.
   ``You're a liar,'' shouted one man in the audience, and another
yelled, ``Fire Snell.''
   Snell said complaints about the company's rejection Tuesday of a
fourth takeover offer from PacifiCorp reflected more on a $200,000
PacifiCorp advertising campaign than the offer itself. Pinnacle
West said the $21-a-share, $1.82 billion offer from the Portland,
Ore.-based utility was inadequate.
   During the meeting, one speaker asked everyone who would like to
sell their stock for $21 a share to stand. About half stood.
   Pinnacle West's shares rose 12{ cents Wednesday to $16.
   It may be three years before dividends are restored, Snell said.
However, he said a stronger performance should strengthen the
company's share price in the meantime.
   Shareholders also rejected a proposal to force board members to
hold at least 2,000 shares of Pinnacle West stock.
   Jeanne Rossi of Boonville, Calif., who offered the idea, said it
was a way to make the board more responsibe.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. launched a defensive advertising
blitz to rescue its $100 million promotion for cans that spout
prizes instead of soda.
   The soft-drink maker ran full-page ads around the nation
containing a detailed list of dos and don'ts for customers in
search of its ``MagiCans.''
   As part of a campaign announced in March, random cans of
Coca-Cola Classic are equipped with mechanisms to eject cash or
prize certificates when the cans are opened. The ads acknowledge
that in ``a small number of instances, the prize mechanism may
jam.''
   ``Also, the mechanism in a very small number of MagiCans
detaches from inside the can and your prize won't pop out.''
   The ads feature cross-section drawings of ``properly working''
and ``malfunctioning'' cans, advising customers to ``Take A Good
Look.''
   MagiCans contain no soda. Instead, the prizes are stashed in
vials, which are suspended in chlorinated water to give the cans
the heft and gurgle of the real thing.
   In addition to malfunctioning ejection systems, some of the cans
have leaked water.
   Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company has
received 22 complaints since the cans reached shelves and vending
machines earlier this month. He stressed that the water in the
prize cans, though it tastes bad, is harmless.
   The ads warn consumers against drinking the water and include a
toll-free telephone number to report bad cans.
   ``Listen for something jiggling inside the can. (That's a
detached mechanism _ a faulty MagiCan),'' the ads say.
   Coke planned to distribute a quarter-million of the prize cans
through the summer. Prizes include cash _ up to $200 _ and
certificates good for such things as tickets to theme parks and
sporting events.
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the beverage industry for
PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco, said Coca-Cola is acting wisely
in addressing the problem before the big soft-drink selling season
starts over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
   ``The key thing is to fix it early, and everyone will forget it
ever happened,'' Goldman said. ``This is not the Hubble telescope.
It's not that difficult to fix.''
   Donaldson said the mechanical problem has been corrected and
prize cans shipped beginning this week should have no problems.
   Though the trouble was detected in a relatively small number of
cans, Donaldson said, ``we're just being extraordinarily cautious.
We don't want any of our consumers to be disappointed.'' He said he
did not know how much the ads cost.
   The quick damage-control initiative recalled the company's
now-legendary reversal when it retired, and later then
reintroduced, the classic formula of its flagship drink, Coca-Cola.
   Despite the problems, the campaign has been successful with
about 60,000 prize winners so far, Donaldson said.
   ``Our plans are to continue the promotion,'' he said.
``Obviously, we'll continue to monitor the situation.''

   How bad is the Soviet economy? Here are some
figures:
   _Wages rose 13.4 percent in first quarter of 1990, while
industrial production dropped 1.2 percent by various estimates.
   _In 1989, production of coal dropped 6 percent, oil and
transportation 4 percent.
   _Of 367 key factories due to be constructed in 1989, only 34
were completed.
   _The national budget deficit of 90 billion rubles is about 10
percent to 11 percent of the gross national product _ three times
worse than the U.S. budget deficit.
   _The standard of living is about 20 percent of that in the
United States.
   _The Soviet Union spends 20 percent to 25 percent of its GNP on
the military, compared with less than 10 percent for the United
States.
   _The Soviet credit rating on international markets has dropped
from one of the best to a rank just below Pakistan.

   Here are the highlights of the Soviet economic
reform plan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PLANNING, PRICES:
   _Government planning of all details of the economy, including
such minutia as how many nails are sent to Novosibirsk, will be
curtailed with creation of a ``regulated market economy,'' with
some free markets and some state-run basic industries.
   _Bread prices are to at least double July 1. Other food prices,
most unchanged since 1954, are to double Jan. 1, 1991.
   _Retail prices will rise an average of 43 percent and wholesale
prices 46 percent on Jan. 1, 1991.
   _Prices of 60 percent of items such as raw materials, energy and
products made by monopolies will remain under government control.
Another 25 percent of prices will be regulated and 15 percent will
float with the market.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JOBS, HOMES:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Wages, pensions and stipends will rise to cover some of the
price hikes. Wages will not rise enough to cover all price hikes
because Soviet salaries are now higher than the value of the goods
and services they produce, leading to severe shortages.
   _The government will promise a job to everyone but it need not
correspond to the person's education and training.
   _Local governments will create public-service jobs similar to
the 1930s New Deal program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for
areas like Central Asia with fast-growing populations and high
unemployment.
   _Cheap, state-owned apartments, now available only after 10-year
waits, will be sold to the public.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RUBLES:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The ruble will be devalued, but the current system of different
exchange rates for different transactions will continue.
   _The ruble will be partially convertible to foreign currencies
in very limited circumstances by 1993 and fully convertibile by
2000.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INDUSTRY:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Service industry and agriculture will be privatized; transport,
space, defense, energy, machine-building and information industries
will remain publicly owned.
   _About 70 percent of the state-owned enterprises will be
converted to stock companies, and their stock gradually sold to the
public.
   _Many monopolies _ the mainstay of the Soviet economy _ will be
broken up.
   _Unprofitable firms will be allowed to go bankrupt and close or
be sold.

<HEAD>Nikkei Rebounds, Closes Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded from
early losses and closed higher today, while the dollar edged up
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 135.24 points, or 0.42
percent, closing at 32,311.75. The index inched up just after the
opening, ended the morning session 56.47 points below its Wednesday
closing figure, and then rebounded in the afternoon.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
that in the afternoon, some market players began buying a small
number of heavy industries issues, prompting buying by other
investors who had stepped off to the sidelines following earlier
selling for profit-taking.
   ``What contributed to the index's afternoon recovery was a rumor
that a Japanese investment trust bank bought millions of shares of
a heavy industry company,'' he added.
   Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said,
however, investors generally were reluctant to buy ahead of
announcements by major companies of their fiscal 1989 earnings.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, down slightly from Wednesday's 630 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 151.43 yen, up 0.08
yen from Wednesday's 151.35-yen finish. It opened at 151.50 yen and
ranged between 150.90 yen and 151.95 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate moved wildly as market players bought it
(dollar) below the 151-yen line and sold it above 151.50 yen for
profit-taking,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The currency rate would be stuck around the current level for
a while until investors find out the direction of trading,'' he
said.
   Some $11.2 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Wednesday's $14.4 billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was at 87.76 points at 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT), up from Wednesday's close of 87.38. The yield was quoted at
7.010 percent, down from 7.090 percent the previous day.

   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the Soviet
people today they must shift from central planning to a market
economy and must brace for high unemployment and inflation during
an expected two-year recession.
   ``Our decision is made. We have to move to the market,'' Ryzhkov
said in a nationally televised address to parliament in which he
catalogued the ills of the ailing socialist economy.
   Kremlin officials are proposing a radical five-year reform, and
they want the plan to be approved in the first national referendum
in Soviet history. No date has been set for the referendum.
   In a two-hour address to the Supreme Soviet parliament, Ryzhkov
did not use the word referendum. He told reporters later that a
national vote was possible, but that lawmakers must pass a law on
referendums first. He urged lawmakers to approve the reforms.
   ``Without the people's consent, we can't take this step. Every
citizen of the country must express his attitude toward the
project,'' Ryzhkov said.
   After Ryzhkov's speech, several dozen members of the opposition
Inter-regional group decided to seek a no-confidence vote.
   ``The government is not proposing a market, only a price hike,''
said Alexei Levashov, a lawmaker from Leningrad.
   Galina Starovoitova, another deputy, warned that people might
take to the streets if bread prices triple on July 1, the first
step of the proposed reform.
   Ryzhkov dismissed efforts to unseat him, but acknowledged that
people find it ``very difficult to accept the proposal that has
been put forward.
   ``The government's task is to explain, to convince people this
is the road we have to take,'' he told reporters.
   Ryzhkov gave assurances that the government would compensate
people, especially low-income families, to help them survive price
hikes for necessities. But he said there would be no compensation
for more costly luxuries, such as jewelry, liquor, tobacco, and
meat and fish delicacies.
   He also promised to provide for the tens of millions of people
that his deputies say could be thrown out of work by reforms.
   Last fall, Ryzhkov blocked parliament from passing a plan for
more rapid reform, and survived a no-confidence vote demanded then
by Inter-regional lawmakers who wanted to move more quickly to a
market economy.
   Ryzhkov told parliament today the transition should be made in
three stages. Starting next Jan. 1 food prices will double on the
average. Meat prices will increase by 2.3 times and fish prices by
2.5 times, he said.
   The first stage also will require parliament, the Council of
Ministers that Ryzhkov heads, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
establish a market-style economic and banking system, he said.
   Gorbachev was present in parliament, and the live TV broadcast
showed him reading the text and nodding his head from time to time.
   The second stage of the reform, the prime minister said, will
involve price reform, a new taxation system and bank interest rates
far higher than the 2 percent now charged and paid by banks.
   ``We need a really tough financing and credit policy that should
become a tool for the government to regulate economic life and
prevent inflation,'' he said.
   The second stage also calls for transferring 60 percent of state
enterprise to joint-stock ownership for eventual sale to private
individuals and companies, or to the workers, he said.
   The actual transfer of ownership and a sharp reduction of
central control should occur in 1993-95, or what Ryzhkov called the
period of ``demonopolizing the economy.''
   The model Ryzhkov outlined, which had not been detailed in
public, sounded closer to a Western system of economic regulation
than to the traditional centrally planned Soviet economy, in which
Moscow set virtually all prices and wages and even tried to specify
wholesale delivery quotas.
   A popular victory for the government's reform plan would
constitute a national consensus on the failure of the Communist
dream, but defeat could bring down Ryzhkov's Communist government.
   ``If the program is not approved, it is my opinion the
government should resign,'' Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
told a news conference on Wednesday.
   No Soviet government has ever been forced to resign because of a
loss in a referendum or parliamentary vote.
   Even if Ryzhkov and his government step down, Gorbachev legally
could continue the four-year presidential term to which he was
elected by the Congress of People's Deputies this year. He is also
the Communist Party general secretary, traditionally the top
Kremlin job.

<HEAD>Summer Air Fare War Erupts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES, EDITS throughout with United matching TWA cuts,
stating it offered coupons in response to other airlines'
promotions; picks up 16th graf, USAir said ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lure of a larger share of the vacation
travel market has led the nation's big airlines to break with
tradition and discount some of their domestic ticket prices during
the busy summer season.
   The latest air fare war began this week, after United Airlines
placed newspaper advertisements on Monday containing coupons good
for $35 off round-trip tickets of $175 or more.
   A day later, Trans World Airlines cut some of its domestic
round-trip fares by up to 30 percent, and American Airlines, Delta
Air Lines, USAir and Continential Airlines announced Wednesday they
also were lowering their ticket prices.
   And today, United, which said it had offered the coupons only in
response to promotions by some of its competitors, said it was also
matching the TWA reductions.
   Industry analysts say that so far, the fare cuts pose little
danger to the companies' earnings.
   ``There are some diminishing returns as far as profitability,
but you don't give up market share to someone else,'' said Paul H.
Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   If the war escalates, earnings could become a casualty, he said.
   Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc., said it
was surprising that the airlines were offering discounts so early
in the vacation season _ reductions are more likely to be announced
in August or September. However, he said, the fare cuts were a good
public relations campaign for the carriers.
   United's coupons are good for flights through Dec. 14 but
excluding Nov. 16-30. The offer requires a Saturday night stay and
tickets must be bought seven days in advance of departure and no
later than Aug. 31.
   United, surpassed last year by American as the nation's biggest
carrier in terms of traffic, was ``looking for a recouping of that
market share'' during the busy summer season, Nisbet said.
   TWA responded to United's move by cutting its domestic
round-trip fares by as much as 30 percent for travel Tuesday
through Thursday. TWA also is requiring a Saturday night stay and a
seven-day advance purchase, and tickets must be purchased by June
7. The discount is in effect for flights through Dec. 13.
   Under TWA's discounts, the lowest coast-to-coast fares fall to
$298 from $428.50.
   The restrictions the airlines have placed on their discounts _
in particular the Saturday night stopover requirement _ place the
lower fares out of the peak periods for business travel, the
carriers' most lucrative market.
   Neidl said he liked the way the discounts were structured
because ``They're not giving away business seats ... and they may
generate new business.''
   American Airlines said Wednesday it would match TWA's cuts, and
Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said his carrier would match TWA's
reductions ``in the vast majority of our markets.''
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker said his carrier would match
TWA's fares systemwide and also accept United's coupons.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said today his airline would match
the TWA discounts. Doughty said United had decided to place the ads
only after other airlines had offered discounts through direct-mail
promotions.
   USAir said it would honor the United coupons and selectively
match the TWA discounts. USAir spokesman David Shipley said
Wednesday his company's fares already were lower in some markets
and would not be discounted in those areas.
   Northwest Airlines said it also would honor the United coupons,
and was studying TWA's discount program and would decide later
whether to match it.
   A spokesman Eastern Airlines said it was studying the fare
changes but had not yet decided what action, if any, it would take.
   Nisbet, the Prudential-Bache analyst, said the airlines might
lose some profits on some routes, in particular the
transcontinental flights popular for vacation travel. However, he
said, ``This will be made up, we believe, by the heavier
profitability in the markets that are not predominantly tourist.
   ``Certainly if (the discounts) were to continue spreading and it
were to be a general across-the-board discount, there would be an
impact on earnings,'' he added.

   The president also said he was pleased with the results so far
of budget negotiations with Congress over steps to reduce the
deficit. As he has repeatedly, Bush said he would not talk about
specifics of any plan, and said he would make a public address on
the size and scope of the deficit ``when we get a solution.''
   Bush threw an unusual bouquet in the direction of Rep. Richard
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader with whom he has tangled,
saying Gephardt had done a good job so far in leading the budget
negotiations.
   Bush said he had no new encouragement to offer on the continuing
standoff in the Soviet Union between the Kremlin leadership and the
breakaway Baltic Republicans.
   The president opened his news conference with a declaration that
he was renewing China's most favored nation trading status for
another year, despite certain opposition from members of Congress
still seething over the anti-Democracy massacre in Tiananmen Square
a year ago.
   Bush urged Congress today to pass ``a good, strong anti-crime
bill'' _ but without curbs on semiautomatic weapons that were
narrowly approved in the Senate on Wednesday.
   ``I sent a crime bill to the Congress and I would like to see it
enacted as a law enforcement bill,'' Bush said. The president said
today he supports limitations on the number rounds of ammunition
that could be carried in semiautomatic weapon clips, but restated
his opposition to the ban on the manufacture and importation of
nine classes of semi-automatics.
   ``Let's get a good strong anti-crime bill and then we can have a
debate about what they want to do'' on automatic weapons issues,
said Bush, a longtime member of the National Rifle Association.
``The automatic weapon part does not have my support ... and I wish
the Congress would stop adding matters of this nature.''

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today as
traders studied the latest data on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 2.37 to 2,853.89
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 525 up, 444 down and
510 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the business day began the Commerce Department reported that
the gross national product grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   The reduction in the figure, from a previous estimate of 2.1
percent, was larger than most analysts had been estimating.
   But the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of
business inventories rather than final sales.
   A shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear
sign of economic weakness, but as a possible portent of an
approaching pickup in production demand.
   Interest rates were little changed in the credit markets
following the news.
   Among actively traded blue chips, McDonald's rose { to 34|;
Coca-Cola gained &lsqb; to 45; DuPont slipped &lsqb; to 40\, and Philip
Morris was down &rsqb; at 44}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.14 to 195.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .61 at 360.26.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up
4.03 to 2,856.26.
   Advancing issues and declines were about evenly balanced in the
overall tally on the NYSE, with 753 up, 739 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 172.33 million shares, against 203.35
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Economy Grew 1.3 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 15th graf, The various, to make GNP total $4.188
trillion, not growing at that rate.</NOTE>

   The nation's economy grew at a sluggish annual
rate of 1.3 percent from January through March, far slower than
previously believed, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the increase in the broadest
measure of economic health _ the gross national product _ was much
weaker than an initial estimate it made one month ago. At that
time, it put GNP growth at a faster 2.1 percent rate.
   The weak growth was accompanied by a spurt in inflation as a
price index tied to the GNP climbed at steep annual rate of 6.7
percent, the biggest inflationary surge in more than eight years.
The increase was revised from an initial estimate of 6.5 percent.
   Although surprised by the size of the downward GNP revision,
economists said they did not believe it indicated the country was
in danger of toppling into a recession.
   They noted that the weakness came from a big reduction in the
estimate of how much business inventories grew during the first
three months of the year.
   Slower inventory growth was viewed as a favorable sign for
future growth because it means businesses will have less of a
backlog of unsold goods to work down before they can start ordering
again.
   ``The first quarter was a time of major inventory correction and
actually a healthy correction,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of the Boston Co. ``It was setting the economy up for sustained
growth provided that sales stay up.''
   The 1.3 percent first quarter GNP increase was only a slight
improvement from a 1.1 percent GNP growth rate in the final three
months of 1989. The growth rates in both quarters were the slowest
since the summer of 1986 when the economy grew at a 0.8 percent
annual rate.
   The inflation rate was the highest since it raced ahead at an
annual rate of 7.7 percent in the final quarter of 1981. The GNP
price guage rose 4.5 percent for all of 1989.
   Many economists expect inflation to moderate as the year
progresses. They contend the first-quarter report was skewed by
unusual winter weather that killed crops and drove up fuel prices.
   Indeed, Commerce said ``about one-half of the step-up was due to
food and energy prices; large increases in January followed
unusually cold weather in December.''
   The growth rate was lowered today because of new information on
business inventories, which were revised down $8.5 billion from the
original report.
   The weaker economic growth means reduced tax revenues and adds
to the problems confronting administration and congressional budget
negotiators. Talks resume today on developing a formula to cut the
deficit to the $64 billion mandated by the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Nevertheless, it was proof the current expansion, which began at
the end of the last recession in November 1982, continued _
although slowly. A recession generally is defined as two straight
declines in the GNP.
   The various changes means the GNP, after adjusting for
inflation, totaled $4.188 trillion after the first three months of
the year.
   ``The revision (in the GNP) was more than accounted for by
change in business inventories,'' the department said.
   It said exports were revised up $9.9 billion, ``but this
revision was largely offset in GNP by an upward revision of $9.0
billion in imports.''
   In a companion report, the department said after-tax profits of
U.S. corporations slowed to a 0.2 percent increase in the first
quarter after rising 2.8 percent in the October-December period of
1989.
   Corporate profits had fallen during each of the first three
quarters of last year, including a 1.1 percent drop during the
comparable months of January through March.
   Surveys show that most economists believe overall growth during
1990 will total 2.0 percent, down from the 3.0 percent level of
activity in 1989 and the slowest since activity declined 2.5
percent during the recession year of 1982.
   But many of the nation's top economic forecasters predict the
economy will avoid a recession for another three years and are
crediting Federal Reserve monetary policies for the extended growth.
   Sixty-three percent of the 68 professional forecasters
responding to a survey by the National Association of Business
Economists said they foresee no recession during the next three
years.
   And 46 percent of those respondents said the primary reason for
the economic expansion is ``effective monetary policy,'' James F.
Smith, NABE president and professor of finance at the University of
North Carolina, told a news conference earlier this week.
   The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee has tried for
two years to stem inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit
without slowing the economy so much that it skids into a recession.

   The stock market retreated today as traders
studied the latest data on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.62 to
2,844.64 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 542 up, 675 down and
542 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.56 million shares at
midmorning.
   As the business day began the Commerce Department reported that
the gross national product grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   The reduction in the figure, from a previous estimate of 2.1
percent, was larger than most analysts had been estimating.
   But the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of
business inventories rather than final sales.
   A shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear
sign of economic weakness, but rather as a possible portent of an
approaching pickup in production demand.
   Interest rates were unchanged to narrowly lower in the credit
markets following the news.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1~ at 43&lsqb;. Brokers cited
a federal regulator's push to ban cigarette vending machines, and
news that the City University of New York and Harvard University
had decided to sell their tobacco stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.62 to 195.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .23 at 359.88.

<HEAD>Japan Airlines Orders 20 Boeing Jets, Takes Options on 34 More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan Airlines Co., Japan's largest airline and
Boeing Co.'s biggest customer, said today it has ordered 20 Boeing
747-400 jetliners and taken options to buy 34 more.
   The deal would total nearly $12 billion if all the options are
exercised, said JAL spokesman Sumitaka Kawamura.
   The new order brings to 74 the number of orders and options JAL
has placed for Boeing's largest jumbo jet.
   JAL had received five of the 74 planes by March and would
receive the rest by 1999 ``if our plans are not changed,'' Kawamura
said. The carrier plans to increase its fleet from 100 planes to
170 over the next nine years to meet an expected increase in
passenger traffic, he said.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the orders would help reduce
Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
   The 747-400, with a range of 8,400 miles, is one of the world's
most sophisticated passenger aircraft. Its computer-aided piloting
requires a cockpit crew of only two.
   JAL is Boeing's largest customer for 747-400 jets with 40 firm
orders, Kawamura said, followed by Singapore Airlines with 29 and
All Nippon Airways Co. of Japan with 26.
   Making up the JAL fleet, he said, are five 747-400s; 61 Boeing
747-100, -200 and -300 jumbo jets; 20 McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s and
14 Boeing 767 planes.
   Besides the 747-400s, Kawamura said JAL ordered 10
McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s last month, with options for 10 more.
   The MD-11s are to be delivered between 1993 and 1998, he said.
   ``So far, we have no plans to make additional orders,'' Kawamura
said.
   He said JAL carried 8.19 million passengers on international
routes in fiscal 1989, which ended on March 31, up 5.6 percent from
a year earlier, and 13.5 million on domestic routes, up 13.3
percent.

   President Bush, juggling delicate
international issues, said today it is premature to grant the
Soviet Union preferential trading status, even as he renewed the
same benefit for China.
   The China decision is sure to cause an uproar on Capitol Hill
among members of Congress who believe it sends the wrong message to
Beijing just a year after its crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Bush disagreed, but said the political climate in this country
would make it ``extraordinarly difficult to grant'' the same
most-favored-nation status to the Soviet Union. ``Many in Congress
feel a direct linkage'' between trade and the Kremlin's treatment
of the breakaway Republic of Lithuania, he said. ``And I must say
it concerns me.''
   Bush also said there are ``enormous'' problems he and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be discussing at next week's
summit that are unlikely to yield immediate agreement, such as
final outlines for reunification of Germany.
   He defended the progress reached in Moscow last week by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in talks with the Soviets. He
said the two sides are very close to agreement on a treaty to
outlaw chemical weapons, and have made progress toward a treaty
reducing nuclear weapons.
   Asked if he had a more restrained reaction to the outcome of the
talks than Baker's upbeat characterization, Bush said there is ``no
light between us at all'' on the subject. ``I am very satisfied
with where we stand.''
   On domestic issues, Bush pledged that his administration would
work with Congress to protect depositors whose money is held in
savings and loan institutions that go into default. He said he did
not have a precise estimate of the cost of the S&amp;L bailout,
although administration officials estimate the government may have
to borrow $130 billion or more.
   The president also said he was pleased with the results so far
of budget negotiations with Congress over steps to reduce the
deficit. As he has repeatedly, Bush said he would not talk about
specifics of any plan, and said he would make a public address on
the size and scope of the deficit ``when we get a solution.''
   Bush threw an unusual bouquet in the direction of Rep. Richard
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader with whom he has tangled. He
said Gephardt had done a good job so far in leading the budget
negotiations.
   Bush said he had no new encouragement to offer on the continuing
standoff in the Soviet Union between the Kremlin leadership and the
breakaway Baltic republics. He said he hoped all parties would soon
begin negotiations. Gorbachev has pressed economic sanctions
against Lithuania.
   ``I sent a crime bill to the Congress and I would like to see it
enacted as a law enforcement bill,'' Bush said. The president said
he supports limitations on the number of rounds of ammunition that
could be carried in semiautomatic weapon clips, but restated his
opposition to the ban on the manufacture and importation of nine
classes of semiautomatics. The Senate narrowly approved the ban
Wednesday.
   ``Let's get a good strong anti-crime bill and then we can have a
debate about what they want to do'' on automatic weapons issues,
said Bush, a longtime member of the National Rifle Association.
``The automatic weapon part does not have my support ... and I wish
the Congress would stop adding matters of this nature.''
   The president opened his news conference with a declaration that
he was renewing China's most-favored-nation trading status for
another year, despite opposition from members of Congress still
seething over the anti-democracy massacre in Tiananmen Square a
year ago.
   Said House Speaker Thomas Foley: ``I think he faces some very
severe problems here... At the present time, I would say there are
not the votes to approve it.'' Congress would have to override a
presidential veto to overturn Bush's decision.
   Foley said his personal opinion was that there should have been
conditions attached which would prod China toward reforms.
   Regarding his China decision, Bush said, ``I concluded that it
is in our best interests and in the interest of the Chinese
people.'' Bush said ending the system of preferential tariffs for
China would drive up costs for American consumers.
   At the same time, Bush said he would not grant similar status to
the Soviet Union until it enacts liberalized emigration
legislation. Such action had been expected on May 31 _ timed for
Gorbachev's summit visit to the United States _ but the vote
apparently has been postponed.
   ``The Soviets have not passed'' the legislation, Bush said.
``China does have the proper policy.''
   Bush said he was pleased with the prospects for a chemical
weapons treaty at the summit, and said the two sides had done
``very well'' in the last several days in progress toward an
agremeent to cut nuclear weapons.
   At the same time, he said there was much work still to do on a
treaty to cut conventional troops, weapons and tanks in Europe. He
singled out the reunification of Germany as a particularly thorny
issue that he and his summit partner will discuss.
   Bush wants a unified Germany as a full partner in the western
NATO alliance, a step opposed by the Soviet Union.
   As for trade, Bush said the political climate in this country
would make it ``extraordinarly difficult to grant''
most-favored-nation status to the Soviet Union. ``Many in Congress
feel a direct linkage there (with the Lithuanian situation) and I
must say it concerns me.''
   But as he has several times, Bush said it was vitally important
for him and Gorbachev to meet. ''I don't want to have two ships
pass in the night, the Soviet Union and the United States. We've
got a lot to talk about,'' he said.
   Bush said he was especially pleased that he and Gorbachev would
have time to talk at Camp David, the presidential retreat that
offers a less formal atmosphere than the White House.
   Gorbachev is due to arrive in the United States next Wednesday
night, and is scheduled to see Bush over the next four days. He is
also expected to visit Minnesota and California before returning to
the Soviet Union.

   President Bush today renewed China's
most-favored-nation trade benefits for one year, brushing aside
critics who favored a hard line a year after the Beijing
government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``I did not want to hurt the Chinese people,'' Bush said. ``I
concluded that it is in our best interests and the interest of the
Chinese people to continue China's trade status. Not to do so would
hurt the United States.''
   Most favored nation status gives China the same benefits,
including lowest-possible tariffs, that the United States extends
to its major trading partners. Losing that status would subject
some $12 billion in Chinese products _ last year's level of imports
_ to sharply rising tariffs.
   Bush also noted that China buys about $6 billion a year in U.S.
products, including aircraft, wheat, chemicals, lumber and other
products. ``Lose this market and we lose American jobs,'' he told a
White House news conference.
   Congress can block the administration's move only by enacting a
``resolution of disapproval,'' which is subject to presidential
veto. It thus would take two-thirds majorities in both chambers to
override Bush's decision.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said shortly after
Bush's announcement, ``I think he faces some very severe problems
here. ... At the present time, I would say there are not the votes
to approve it.''
   Foley said there should have been conditions attached to any
extension, to prod China toward reforms. However, an administration
official said in advance of Bush's remarks that the trade status
either must be renewed each year or withdrawn, that there is no way
to make it provisional.
   In an opening statement before taking questions from reporters
at the White House, Bush stressed that his decision was not meant
to condone the policies of the government of China in suppressing
the pro-Democracy movement there.
   In answer to a question, he said, ``I don't think this is a
reward to Beijing.''
   Bush said other sanctions against the Chinese government would
remain in place and called anew on Beijing to improve its
human-rights record.
   He vehemently rejected assertions the move sent the wrong signal
to leaders of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``It says that economic contacts are the best way to keep the
economic reforms going,'' Bush said. ``It says that the more
economic contacts we have with China the more they are going to see
the fruits of free-market economies. It should send no other
message than that isolation is bad and economic involvement is
good.''
   Withdrawing China's most-favored-nation trade status probably
would have sent tariffs soaring on China-made goods, including
about $8.5 billion in mostly toys and textiles re-exported to the
United States by Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government, which lobbied
hard against withdrawing the most favored nation benefits, contends
the move would send tariffs to as high as 70 percent.
   Bush made the announcement just hours before a senior State
Department official was to appear before Congress to explain the
decision and answer critics of the administration's China policy.
   Bush said several U.S. allies and major trading partners had
urged him to renew China's trade benefits.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters Wednesday
that failure to renew the benefits could harm ``very significant
and substantial'' U.S. economic interests.
   Although the decision _ widely expected _ already has caused an
uproar among critics of Bush's China policy, Bush and Baker both
said that withdrawing the trade benefits would do more harm than
good.
   ``The real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide
that you're not going to extend it,'' Baker said.
   He said the administration remains upset with the
``disappointing lack of progress'' by Chinese leaders on the human
rights front since the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
   ``You should consider the effect of this upon the reformers in
the Chinese government, people that want to take China toward more
openness and toward more democratization,'' Baker said.
   ``You ought to consider, I would think, the effect on some very
significant and substantial economic interests that the United
States has (including) the effect on er said.
   Asked by reporters what evidence of improved conditions the
administration could Hong Kong,'' Bakpoint to in the year since the Tiananmen
Square killings, Baker said: ``The release recently of 211
detainees, the lifting of martial law in Tibet, a general
indication of willingness to take steps such as that.''
   But, he added, ``you ought not to draw that type of linkage. I
think the real issue is ... what are the consequences of
terminating it.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting prospects for further planting delays in the Midwest and
more large grain sales to China.
   Corn and soybean futures were up strongly following forecasts
for rain this weekend and next week in the Corn Belt, where soggy
field conditions have frustrated farmers' attempts to finish their
spring corn sowing.
   The weather outlook was seen as more supportive for the corn
market than for soybeans, since farmers can still switch to
soybeans if they are unable to get corn planted in time to avoid
yield losses.
   ``I would say that if they don't get done planting corn by the
end of next week you will see some acres shifted to soybeans,''
said William Biedermann, director of research with the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Wheat futures rose only slightly on this morning's news that the
Bush administration has decided to extend for one year China's
status as a most favored trading partner.
   The designation means China is likely to remain a major foreign
buyer of U.S. grain.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.34} a bushel;
corn was 3} cents to 4\ cents higher with July at $2.80{ a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher with July at $1.53{ a bushel;
soybeans were 6 cents to 7} cents higher with July at $6.16 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange following steep losses in Wednesday's
session.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
June at 73.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with May at 85.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .12
cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 65.65 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to .28 cent higher with July
at 66.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Sullivan Urges States To Ban Vending Machines</HEAD>

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan urged the
states today to ban cigarette vending machines, license tobacco
retailers and take other steps to stop young people from buying
tobacco.
   In testimony submitted to the Senate Finance Committee, Sullivan
said strengthening enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of
cigarettes to children is ``the single most important reform''
states could make to keep teenagers from taking up the habit.
   Sullivan proposed model legislation that he urged the states to
enact, including a ban on vending machines that dispense cigarettes.
   ``You can't buy beer from a vending machine. Why should you be
able to purchase cigarettes there?'' Sullivan asked.
   The package also includes a provision that would create a
licensing system for tobacco retailers similar to the system used
to control the sale of alcoholic beverages.
   Another provision would institute penalties, including fines and
license suspensions, for retailers who sell cigarettes to minors.
   ``The model law attempts to create workable procedures which
will provide retail outlets the incentives and tools to refuse to
sell tobacco to minors, as already required by law in 44 states''
and the District of Columbia, he said.
   Sullivan said adult smokers would not be affected by the
proposed law.
   A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, Walker Merryman, said
Sullivan's proposal was ``an easy shot at the people who own and
operate vending machines,'' but would not be effective at keeping
tobacco away from children.
   ``I don't think that this is going to do anything to affect the
number of young people who buy cigarettes,'' Merryman said. ``We
know from a variety of surveys that a very small percentage of
minors who buy cigarettes buy them from vending machines.''
   Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke,
praised Sullivan's ideas, which he said could ``become the
centerpiece of America's war against drugs. The momentum is
building for an all-out battle against tobacco.''
   After his testimony, Sullivan was asked by reporters why he was
proposing a state-by-state solution rather than a uniform federal
law. He said that ``by encouraging the states to enforce their
laws...(we) would use the system that's already in place.''
   He said the states could phase in such a ban on vending machines
by first restricting their locations to places such as nightclubs
and bars where children are not permitted.
   ``Problems don't always have to be solved with a broad swath
from the federal government,'' he said.
   Sullivan also said that he supported the intent of anti-smoking
legislation that was passed by a Senate committee last week, but he
said the administration does not support the legislation because it
would create another federal bureaucracy.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said he was interested
in Sullivan's approach and said the proposed model state
legislation ``is a good step forward.''
   Anti-smoking legislation approved last week by the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee would spend $110 million on a program
to encourage states to enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes
to minors, including restrictions on vending machines.
   The Bush administration in February said many provisions of the
legislation were unnecessary.
   An article in this week's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association said 3 million Americans under age 18 consume
947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of snuff
and chewing tobacco annually.
   Nearly 19 percent of high school seniors smoke daily _ 11
percent of them more than a half pack per day _ according to an
annual survey of high school seniors by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse's annual survey of high school seniors.
   Sullivan has said that 80 percent to 90 percent of adults who
smoke started before they were 18 years old.
   About 16 percent of illegal cigarette sales to minors come from
vending machines, according to a report by the inspector general of
the Department of Health and Human Services requested by Sullivan.
   ``The younger the children are, the more likely they are to
purchase from a machine,'' said the report released today.
   ``Enforcement experts agree that effective youth access
legislation should deal with vending machines,'' the report said.
   The report said half the states have no policy on access to
cigarette vending machines by minors, and a third require a warning
sign be posted on the machine saying sales to minors are prohibited.
   A few states limit placement of vending machines to places that
do not allow children, and Utah had limited success in an
experiment using locking devices that required an employee to
activate the machine, the report said.
   Sixteen communities in Minnesota have banned cigarette vending
machines entirely and ``these bans have generally been well
received and are expected to lead to stricter enforcement of
over-the-counter sales.''
   Sullivan has made anti-smoking issues one of his top priorities
at the Department of Health and Human Services.
   In January, he took on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for planning to
test market a cigarette aimed primarily at blacks, saying the
company was promoting ``a culture of cancer.'' The next day,
Reynolds canceled its plans.
   Then he called on professional athletes to turn away the ``blood
money'' from cigarette companies that sponsor sporting events.
   More recently, lawmakers were wondering whether Sullivan had
changed his views on smoking when his assistant secretary for
health, James Mason, canceled his appearance at a congressional
hearing on cigarette exports.
   But Sullivan said that was a trade issue and best addressed by
trade officials. He said one of his top priorities remains ``to
eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as
intended causes death.''
   Cigarettes, health officials say, cause about 390,000 premature
deaths annually from lung cancer, heart disease and other
cardiovascular disorders.

<TEXT>
   The court-appointed trustee for
Eastern Airlines said the carrier was doing well in its efforts to
recover from bankruptcy and officials were not actively trying to
sell the firm.
   Martin Shugrue gave Eastern Airlines' creditors a status report
Wednesday in their first meeting since he was appointed to run the
airline.
   ``We had a very candid, constructive open dialogue with the
creditors,'' Shugrue said. ``I was very encouraged by their
attitude.''
   There have been recent reports that Northwest Airlines and
perhaps Pan American World Airways were interested in acquiring or
combining with Eastern.
   ``We've had, as I've said before, expressions of interest from a
number of people, and we'll examine every expression of interest.
But to comment any further is just premature,'' Shugrue said.
   ``We're not out peddling the business or shopping the company,
we're devoting our energies to restoring viability to Eastern and
we're off to a darn fine start,'' he said.
   Eastern's cut-rate ``Y-not'' fare promotion, offering money-back
satisfaction guarantees and first-class seats for below-industry
coach rates, has ``gone over very, very well,'' Shugrue said.
   ``We have seen double-digit increases in our advance bookings
for summer travel, north-south travel, families coming to Florida
flying Eastern Airlines, and we're very heartened by our initial
look at the marketplace,'' he said.
   Shugrue, who would not give details of the meeting with
creditors at a hotel in this Miami suburb, was appointed April 18
by a federal bankruptcy judge after creditors became increasingly
upset by setbacks in the rebuilding plan of the Texas Air Corp.
management led by Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since
March 9, 1989.
   Shugrue said negotiations were ongoing with the pilots and
Machinists unions. The pilots are negotiating recalls of union
pilots, who ended their sympathy strike last November, while the
Machinists union has been on strike since March 4, 1989.
   Several picketers from the Machinists union were outside the
hotel before the meeting. Union spokesman Steve Alvarez said the
demonstration was a friendly one, meant to inform the creditors of
the union's eagerness to work to help Eastern recover.

   President Bush said today the worsening
savings and loan crisis ``causes me great concern'' and the first
priority of government policymakers is to protect the depositors.
   ``We don't know the impact on the taxpayer yet,'' Bush told a
news conference in the White House briefing room, a day after
administration officials released a new assessment of the problem.
   Bush said administration officials ``don't know a specific
figure'' for the ultimate cost of the bailout but that Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady had testified on some ``broad paramaters
that are on the record.''
   Brady told Congress the administration now estimates the
government will have to borrow between $90 billion and $130 billion
to clean up the mess. Tne new assessment came after the
administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk of the
problem could be resolved with the $50 billion in borrowing
authority included in the S&amp;L bailout bill.
   ``What we are going to do about it is have negotiations with the
Congress and out of this I am sure that we will have an answer that
Congress agrees with,'' the president said, referring to the budget
negotiations now underway.
   ``We can't brush this problem under the rug. It has been
building for 20 years and it is something that causes me great
concern,'' Bush said.
   ``We do know that we are going to protect the depositors and
that is what this is all about,'' Bush said. ``It isn't protecting
any savings and loan people. It is protecting the depositors.''
   The administration won praise on Capitol Hill Wednesday for
finally issuing a realistic assessment of how much it will cost to
clean up the savings and loan industry _ already the largest
government bailout in history.
   But some Democratic critics questioned why it took so long to
come up with an accurate figure. They wonder why the government
isn't doing more to prosecute the high-flyers who created the mess
in the first place.
   The administration also left unanswered how to pay for the
higher bailout cost, leaving that for the current round of budget
negotiations. Congressional and administration budget-writers are
looking for ways to reduce next year's federal deficit to the $64
billion required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   The exploding costs of the S&amp;L bailout were one of the principal
reasons the administration was forced to call for the budget
negotiations in the first place.
   The revised estimate marked the first time the administration
acknowledged that the $50 billion in borrowing authority included
in last year's massive S&amp;L bailout bill would not be enough.
   Private analysts who follow the S&amp;L industry generally agreed
with the new figure, although it omits interest costs from the
equation. When borrowing costs are added, the ultimate price of the
bailout over 40 years is likely to top $300 billion.
   ``The administration is to be commended for producing much more
realistic and candid numbers than they did 15 months ago,'' said
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., savings and loan analyst.
   Brady blamed 90 percent of the higher cost on a depressed real
estate market, where S&amp;Ls have most of their loans.
   ``We are dealing with a moving target, made greatly more
expensive by a weakening real estate market and constantly changing
economic conditions,'' Brady said.
   However, Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution discounted
Brady's explanation, contending, ``The fact is they made a mistake.
They low-balled it.''
   Some Democratic critics contended the new estimate showed that
the administration was not moving quickly enough to close sick S&amp;Ls.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that without prompt action
``the crisis will ge worse.''
   But Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, called the new estimate ``an
enormous step toward a reflection of greater reality. ... For the
first time, we have a government statistic that I believe has
certain credibility to it.''
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., faulted the administration for not
doing enough to prosecute S&amp;L operators who squandered depositors'
funds through fraudulent loan practices.
   ``Why ask the taxpayer to ante up more money when we see no
action to put the people who stole us blind in jail?'' he asked.
   In an effort to respond to criticism that criminal prosecutions
have lagged, Timothy Ryan, the new head of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, told reporters Wednesday that financial regulators
were working to get the worst criminal cases forwarded to
prosecutors, sending 20 cases to the Justice Department in recent
weeks with an additional 100 cases being prepared.

   The stock market showed a small loss today as
traders studied the latest data on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.32 to 2,852.94
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 618 up, 695 down and
551 unchanged.
   As the business day began the Commerce Department reported that
the gross national product grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   The reduction in the figure, from a previous estimate of 2.1
percent, was larger than most analysts had been estimating.
   But the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of
business inventories rather than final sales.
   A shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear
sign of economic weakness, but rather as a possible portent of an
approaching pickup in production demand.
   Interest rates were unchanged to narrowly lower in the credit
markets following the news.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1&rsqb; at 43}. Brokers cited
a federal regulator's push to ban cigarette vending machines, and
news that the City University of New York and Harvard University
had decided to sell their tobacco stocks.
   U.S. Shoe, which reported sharply higher quarterly earnings,
climbed 1&rsqb; to 24~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.26 to 195.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .72 at 360.37.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.45 million shares at
noontime, against 83.65 million at the same point Wednesday.

   Television junkies, get ready to graze.
   Despite failed effortmore are expected to be purchased this year at
an
average cost of $2,500 per dish, said Chuck Hewitt, head of the
Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association.
   It may appear at first glance that cable TV system operators,
with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in ground-based
delivery systems and more than 52 million customers, would be
arch-enemies of satellite TV.
   But the nation's leading cable operators are at the forefront of
two plans announced in February for satellite delivery systems.
   Nine cable operators including the two largest,
Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver and Time Warner Inc.'s American
Television and Communications Corp. of Stamford, Conn., are part of
K-Prime Partners which plans a 10-channel service.
   K-Prime intends to beam signals from seven big-city TV stations,
such as WGN of Chicago and KTLA of Los Angeles, along with three
pay-per-view channels to receiving dishes the size of a garbage can
lid. Its satellite is in orbit.
   The service, which will be tested in 40 markets in October and
launched nationally in January, will cost $20-25 a month after a
$50-100 installation fee, said group chairman John J. Sie.
   He said he would like to get a couple million subscribers to
what is being billed as an extension of existing cable service, and
the group plans to step up to a higher-powered satellite and more
channels in a few years if the service succeeds. The initial cost
of the K-Prime venture is $100 million.
   The second major satellite TV project is a $1 billion venture
called Sky Cable that has the backing of Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. Ltd., General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co., the
cable operator Cablevision Systems Corp. and General Motors Corp.'s
Hughes Communications Inc.
   It plans to use three high-power satellites that will be
launched in late 1993 and early 1994 and employ technology still
under development, which will enable it to beam up to 108 channels
to 12-inch-by-18-inch receiver panels that can be mounted in a
windowsill.
   The receivers will cost about $300; the monthly service fee has
not yet been established. The service is expected to start in 1994.
   The Sky Cable partners hope to carry many networks now offered
on cable, including those they own such as Bravo, Consumer News and
Business Channel and American Movie Classics, as well as
pay-per-view services and specialized channels that appeal to
narrow audiences like chess players.
   But launching such services is complex. Charles Dolan of
Cablevision said he hoped the Sky Cable partners would sign a
definitive agreement by late April; that milepost has passed with
no new target date in sight although those involved say there are
no serious disagreements.
   The financial risks also are obvious. News Corp. has lost more
than $400 million to date in launching satellite TV service in
Britain.
   Both K-Prime and Sky Cable should appeal to the estimated 16
million U.S. households located in areas so remote that cable TV
systems may never try to reach them by ground connections.
   But what about the city dweller who decides to sign up for Sky
Cable directly, bypassing his regular cable company?
   Cablevision's Dolan says that's unlikely. Viewers want to watch
local stations and cable systems will still be the best way to get
them, he said. Local advertisers also will still need local cable
outlets.
   Dolan wants cable system operators to serve as intermediaries to
customers for Sky Cable, handling service calls, billing and
signups for a fee.
   He argues that Sky Cable and local cable systems can complement
each other, enabling local systems to add channel capacity for
customers without incurring the heavy costs of rebuilding ground
connections. He said subscribers won't care who is providing which
stations.
   Cable analyst Michael Kupinski of the investment firm A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis said satellite TV services won't
seriously threaten local cable operators for years. ``Inertia is in
local cable's favor,'' he said.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University, said satellite TV
``absolutely threatens'' local cable systems, and said that may
explain why big cable operators are moving quickly into this
emerging side of the business.
   ``Cable was always seen as a transitional technology,'' he said.
``This is risky and dangerous in the short run but there really is
no choice _ they have to become players.''
   Several major cable network operators declined to comment on DBS
ventures. They acknowledge privately that while they would like to
get wider distribution so they can attract more advertisers, they
don't want to alienate cable system operators. ``Cable brought us
to the dance,'' one said.
   Many cable system operators own stakes in cable networks, and
some bristle at Sky Cable's plans to sign up existing cable
networks.
   But critics say cable operators who own cable networks have too
much power already and feel viewers would be better served by
independent satellite TV operators.
   Dan Garner, president of Advanced Communications Corp. in Little
Rock, Ark., is one of the would-be independent satellite TV
operators.
   He is trying to arrange $700 million in financiang for
satellites for a 54-channel service that he said would carry a mix
of basic, educational and premium networks, radio stations,
pay-per-view channels and electronic publishing services.
   ``We are the competition _ the independent DBS operator,''
Garner said. ``Our prices will be less and our service will be
better ... and you will be able to get us on the phone.''

   They are getting ready to cover the courts, show
how to change an oil filter, revive some popular westerns and
debate the hottest issues of the day.
   They want to do it on cable TV.
   But would-be cable network operators are finding it's tough to
get channel space and join the ranks of kingpins like Cable News
Network, ESPN or MTV.
   Even when you have a great idea, a capable staff and
consistently appealing programs, network executives still must
convince hundreds of individual cable TV system operators to free a
channel on increasingly congested systems.
   Channels in the works include Golden American Network for senior
citizens; a Sci-Fi Channel that promises ``a full-course meal'' of
science fiction and fantasy programs, and Career Television Network
with tips on finding jobs.
   Here are some other network ideas that could wind up on your
cable television system in the next few years:

   Two comedy channels are in operation and fighting for channel
space, and there may soon be competing courtroom cable channels as
well.
   Cablevision Systems Corp., which already offers several movie
and sports networks, plans a network called In Court this fall
offering live coverage of judicial proceedings ranging from
criminal trials to traffic and small claims court proceedings. It
will also offer legal news, profiles of judges and trial lawyers,
dicussions of legal issues and live call-in shows.
   A similar service called the American Trial Network is
reportedly being planned by the owners of the publication The
American Lawyer. Founder Steven Brill has repeatedly declined
comment on the reports.

<HEAD>HOW-TO CHANNEL:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Does the popularity of home-repair shows such as ``This Old
House'' indicate there would be viewer support for an entire
network devoted to how-to topics such as home or auto repairs and
beauty and health tips?
   Communications Equity Associates, a Tampa, Fla.-based investment
banking firm specializing in the communications business, plans to
test such a service later this year. If it works, the network could
be launched in 1991.
   The idea is to assemble short segments on topics like fixing a
faucet or repairing a light fixture into a longer program on a
topic such as home repair.

   Singer Willie Nelson is heading a group planning to launch The
Cowboy Channel late this year with Western movies and reruns of
popular TV series such as ``Gunsmoke,'' ``The Virginian'' and
``Wagon Train.''
   Mack Long, the president and chief executive of the Austin,
Texas-based company called The Cowboy Newtwork, said the service
would also feature new programs, music and a weekly show called The
Songwriter.
   ``We feel there are an awful lot of cowboys out there doing
their own deal _ anybody who shows independence,'' Long said.

<HEAD>TALK CHANNEL:</HEAD>

   The backers of this proposed channel have been working on their
proposal for more than two years and aren't ready to talk about it
in detail just yet.
   But Paul Fitzpatrick, the founder of Talk Television Partners of
Wilton, Conn., described the concept as ``talk radio with
pictures.''
   ``It is the last broad-based format that really has not been
adpated to cable,'' he said, citing sports, news, music, public
affairs and comedy as the other such formats. No target date for
launch has been set.

<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee tried today to
set commodity target prices and loan rates in the 1990 farm bill so
farmers would have adequate support without excessive government
spending during the next five years.
   A proposal from Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the
wheat, soybeans and feed grains subcommittee and Rep. Ron Marlenee,
R-Mont., would freeze target prices on wheat at $4 until 1995.
   It would set loan rates at 85 percent of the average market
price from the previous five years. That would be an increase over
current law.
   The target price is the amount the government sets as the ideal
price for a commodity. The loan rate is the amount the government
gives the farmers before planting to assure they can afford to put
crops in the ground.
   The government ends up paying the farmer the difference if the
target price is higher than the market price. If the market price
falls below the loan rate the farmer turns over his crops to the
government and doesn't have to repay the loan.
   The committee had hoped to finish its work on the farm bill by
the end of the day, but was moving slowly because of protracted
debate.
   By noon, the section on wheat was not finished and six other
sections remained _ feed grains, oilseeds, sugar, conservation,
research and miscellaneous.
   On Wednesday, the committee worked into the night to complete
the bill's sections on wool, honey, dairy and general commodity
provisions.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, called off further
action on its version of the farm bill until it devises a
commodities price support system acceptable to both Republicans and
Democrats on the committee.
   The task was assigned to committee Chairman Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., and Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Vt., David Pryor, D-Ark., Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who are
not expected to have a proposal until next month.
   Though budget uncertainties, election year concerns and
international trade talks on agriculture are pressuring the
lawmakers, both the Senate and the House committees are determined
to push onward with the bill that will set farm policy for the next
five years even though those factors could lead to changes later.
   Among the key changes sought by farmers in the 1990 legislation
is more flexibility to rotate crops, both for environmental and
market reasons. Of particular concern is the way the current
program has rewarded wheat and feed grain production at the expense
of soybeans and other oilseeds while the world demand for oilseeds
has increased.
   The proposal adopted Wednesday by the House committee would
allow farmers to switch 25 percent of the acreage now protected by
subsidies to some other crop without losing the potential to put it
back into a subsidized commodity later.
   Lawmakers reasoned that this could help boost soybean production
without adding to government costs.
   The committee also voted to limit government subsidies for wool
producers so each farmer receives no more than $250,000 a year.
   That cap was the only significant change made in wool and mohair
policy for the 1990 farm bill. It puts sheep farmers under the same
limitations as other commodity producers.
   The other provisions in the wool and mohair section are
basically the same as those established by the 1985 legislation.
The Senate made no changes in the current program.
   The purpose of the wool and mohair program is to encourage
production by providing incentive payments.
   During the last decade, however, the amount the government
guarantees wool producers has averaged almost twice the market
price, resulting in record government payments.
   Wool and mohair payments totaled about $93 million last year,
down from the record $152 million in 1987.
   The House also approved a honey program that maintains
government support at current levels.
   The government helps honey producers maintain a stable income by
offering loans at a certain price per pound. If the market price is
lower than the loan rate, the farmer turns his honey over to the
government as full payment for the loan.
   The cost to the government has been between $42 million and $100
million a year since 1985.
   The committee completed work on the dairy section of the bill by
voting for a study of state milk pricing programs that could lead
to changes in the way milk processors are subsidized.
   The provision was a compromise that allows California to
continue to enjoy a special federal allowance that helps
manufacturers of cheese, non-fat dry milk and other milk products
in that state.
   The day before, the committee did its major work on the dairy
program by deciding that farmers should receive no less than $10.10
per hundred pounds of milk.
   Under current law, dairy support prices have no minimum and
could drop as low as about $8.60 per hundred pounds.

   A wealthy Wall Street economist emerged
today as the leading contender for the Republican nomination to
challenge Gov. Mario Cuomo's expected re-election bid.
   Pierre Rinfret moved to the top of the GOP list when investment
counselor John Loeb Jr. bowed out of possible contention.
   ``I was always, frankly, a reluctant candidate,'' Loeb said
early this afternoon. Loeb said he would ``wholeheartedly support''
Rinfret if he ran for governor.
   A spokeswoman for Rinfret said this morning that her boss hadn't
yet decided whether he would run for governor.
   The New York Times reported today that Rinfret was the choice of
GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett and a group of party leaders. But a
Barrett aide denied that, saying, ``Nobody has been selected.''
   Elizabeth DelTorto, an assistant to Barrett, said the chairman
had held discussions with both Rinfret and Loeb on Wednesday. She
also said New York University professor Herbert London was still in
the running.
   State Assemblyman John Cochrane, the Suffolk County GOP
chairman, said this morning that ``as of last night it was my
understanding that (Rinfret) was the candidate. I've heard nothing
to the contrary.''
   Rinfret said through a spokeswoman that nothing definite had
been decided.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
contender, is expected to announce within days his bid for a third
four-year term. The state Democratic convention begins June 4. The
GOP convention gets under way Tuesday.
   Barrett has been searching almost a year for a Cuomo opponent.
He has been turned down by one well-known Republican after another
at a time when Cuomo is considered vulnerable because of rising
taxes and continuing deficits.
   Rinfret, an unpaid economic adviser to Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon, heads an economic consulting firm in New York
City.
   Debbie Ishlon, a spokeswoman for the 66-year-old economist, said
Wednesday, ``As far as he's concerned, there are still issues to be
discussed. It's not definitely determined that he would be a
candidate.''
   Loeb, 60, said Wednesday he had been talking with Republican
leaders about running for governor.
   The son of a wealthy financier, Loeb was President Reagan's
ambassador to Copenhagen from 1981 to 1983 and a special adviser on
environmental matters to Gov. Nelson Rockefeller from 1967 to 1973.
   ``Aha! ... I told you that if I run, I have to go out and get a
lot of money because they will come up with a fortune,'' Cuomo said
when told about Loeb.
   Cuomo, who has more than $7 million in his campaign warchest,
has maintained the Republicans will raise at least $25 million to
beat him.
   The only announced candidate for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination is little-known insurance broker Herbert Holland from
suburban New York. He has never run for office and has little
support among the GOP leadership
   Holland has proposed, among other things, that all New Yorkers
be tested for drugs when they seek to renew their driver's licenses.

<HEAD>GM Holds Shareholder Meeting; Executive Pensions Up for Debate</HEAD>

   GM Chairman Roger Smith's impending retirement,
and a controversial proposal that would double his annual pension,
are expected to be dominant topics at General Motors Corp.'s annual
meeting Friday.
   Smith retires July 31 after heading the world's largest
industrial corporation for 9{ years.
   During his tenure, GM saw its share of the U.S. car market
tumble 12 points to 32 percent, while the company laid off tens of
thousands of workers and closed factories. For three years
beginning in 1986, it finished second to Ford Motor Co. as the
most-profitable U.S. automaker.
   Also during Smith's tenure, GM embarked on an extensive
plant-modernization program, expanded its ties with overseas
automakers and slashed its costs to stay competitive with Ford and
a half-dozen Japanese automakers.
   Shareholders will vote on a management proposal to modify some
retirement plans, sharply increasing benefits for the company's
top-ranking 3,350 executives.
   It basically would change the base for figuring pension payments
from salary alone to salary plus bonuses. Smith was paid $2.5
million in 1989, more than half in stock options.
   Pension plans for Ford and Chrysler Corp. executives are based
on salary without bonuses.
   The program will cost GM about $42 million a year. That galls
Michigan state Treasurer Robert Bowman, who says the state's
pension fund will vote its 8.8 million GM shares, just over 1
percent of the shares outstanding, against the proposal.
   ``Offhand, I can think of three better uses: product
development, plant modernization and the workers' pension system is
underfunded,'' he said. ``I think all three of those are better
uses of the money.''
   The 20-member GM board, which includes six company executives,
proposed the pension hikes. It said the current plan's retirement
provisions, compared with total compensation, ranks in the lower 20
percent of all pension programs.
   Dale Hanson, chief executive officer of the California Public
Employees Retirement System, said his organization would vote its
6.2 million shares in favor of the proposal, but he questions the
timing.
   GM and the United Auto Workers union begin talks on a new labor
agreement a few weeks before Smith retires.
   ``It (the pension proposal) was not only ill-timed, but showed
exactly where the company is at in terms of greed and the way
they're running the business,'' said Sam Isaac, a member of the
UAW's GM national bargaining committee from Local 651 in Flint.
   Bowman and Hanson, despite their differing views, praised GM for
bringing the matter to shareholders. The board could have changed
the formula without seeking shareholder approval.
   ``Say what you will about it, but you can't call them anything
but candid and up-front about putting it up before the voters,''
Bowman said.
   Bowman said he expects the plan to pass.
   Activist shareholder Evelyn Y. Davis said Thursday she will make
her annual appearance at the meeting. She promised to wear a short
dress, symbolizing that GM shareholders ``are getting the short
end'' on the pension issue.
   Eleven other proposals, ranging from South Africa relations to
space weapons, are on the agenda Friday.

   Stock prices drifted lower today as traders
studied the latest data on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.17 to 2,850.09
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 665 up, 772 down and
536 unchanged.
   As the business day began the Commerce Department reported that
the gross national product grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   The reduction in the figure, from a previous estimate of 2.1
percent, was larger than most analysts had been estimating.
   But the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of
business inventories rather than final sales.
   A shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear
sign of economic weakness, but rather as a possible portent of an
approaching pickup in production demand.
   Interest rates were unchanged to narrowly lower in the credit
markets following the news.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1{ at 43|. Brokers cited
a federal regulator's push to ban cigarette vending machines, as
well as news that the City University of New York and Harvard
University had decided to sell their tobacco stocks.
   U.S. Shoe, which reported sharply higher quarterly earnings,
climbed 1&rsqb; to 24~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.57 to 195.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .81 at 360.46.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 109.66 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Six Japanese Electronics Firms Report Profit Growth for Fiscal
1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Six major Japanese electronics companies, led by Mitsubishi
Electric Corp., reported higher profits and sales for the fiscal
year ended March 31.
   Mitsubishi reported its earnings for the fiscal year shot up 44
percent compared with fiscal 1988 to a record high. Consolidated
sales also reached a record for the period.
   Mitsubishi, which makes industrial as well as consumer
electronics, attributed its results to Japan's booming domestic
demand, due to investment in plants and equipment, as well as
consumer demand.
   The company reported net income of 76.8 billion yen, or $533
million at the average exchange rate during the year of 144 yen to
the dollar, compared with 53.2 billion yen, or $369 million, a year
earlier.
   Sales totaled 2.98 trillion yen, or $20.7 billion, up 9.6
percent from 2.72 trillion yen, or $18.9 billion, a year earlier.
   Sony Corp. said its net profit for the fiscal year climbed 42
percent to 103 billion yen, or $715 million, from 72.5 billion yen,
or $504 million, a year earlier.
   Sony's sales rose 34 percent to 2.88 trillion yen, or $20.0
billion, from 2.15 trillion yen, or $14.9 billion, the year before.
   Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest computer manufacturer, said its
net income rose 24 percent to 86.8 billion yen, or $603 million, up
from 69.9 billion yen, or $485 million, the year before.
   Sales rose 6.8 percent to 2.55 trillion yen, or $17.7 billion,
from 2.39 trillion yen, or $16.6 billion.
   Hitachi Ltd. said its profit for the fiscal year rose 14 percent
to 210 billion yen, or $1.46 billion, from 185 billion yen, or
$1.29 billion.
   Sales totaled 7.08 trillion yen, or $49.2 billion, up 11 percent
from 6.40 trillion, or $44.4 billion.
   The Matsushita group, the world's largest consumer electronics
company, said its profit for the year rose 10.4 percent to 236
billion yen, or $1.64 billion.
   Sales reached a record of 6 trillion yen, or $41.7 billion, up 9
percent.
   Matsushita, whose best-known brand name is Panasonic, credited
the results to a significant increase in overseas production that
contributed to sales increases in North America and other regions.
   Toshiba Corp. said its earnings jumped 10 percent to 132 billion
yen, or $917 million, from 119 billion yen, or $826 million, the
year before.
   Sales totaled 4.25 trillion yen, or $29.5 billion, up from 3.80
trillion yen, or $26.4 billion, in fiscal 1988.

<HEAD>Japan Airlines Order Is One Of Boeing's Top Ten</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Japan Airlines order for 20 Boeing 747-400
airplanes is one of the top Boeing orders of all time and makes JAL
the largest customer for the jumbo jet, Boeing officials said
Thursday.
   The order, worth $3.1 billion, brings to 40 the number of firm
orders placed by JAL for the 747-400s. JAL also has options for 34
more of the aircraft.
   If all options are exercised, the order would be worth more than
$7 billion, said Tom Cole, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group.
   The jet, which can seat 600 people, has a range to 8,400 miles
and a computer-aided cockpit that requires a crew of only two. The
JAL planes will be configured to carry 375 to 404 passengers in
three classes and will be outfitted with General Electric CF6-80C2
engines.
   Following JAL in firm orders for the 747-400s are Singapore
Airlines with 29 and All Nippon Airways Co. of Japan with 26, Cole
said.
   ``We call the Pacific a `747 ocean,''' he said. ``We do expect
the airplane to sell well. It really has no competition.''
   The order brings to 1,002 the total number of orders for the 747
series jets, making it the fourth civil airplane type in history to
surpass the 1,000-mark in sales, Boeing said. The other models are
Boeing's 727 and 737 series and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series.
   In dollar terms, the deal puts JAL in a four-way tie for fourth
place among all Boeing orders with All Nippon Airways, United
Airlines and Delta Airlines.
   The largest Boeing order ever was made by GPA Ltd. in May 1989,
with 182 planes worth $9.4 billion. That order did not include any
747s, Cole said.
   Boeing has delivered 70 of the 747-400s since the model was
first rolled off the assembly line in January 1989. A total of 279
of the jets have now been ordered.
   The JAL order brings to 138 the number of firm orders for Boeing
planes this year, worth $11.4 billion, Cole said. The company sold
a record 887 jets worth $46.7 billion last year, he said.
   Sumitaka Kawamura of JAL said that if the airline exercises all
34 options, its total investment in 747-400s will be nearly $12
billion. JAL plans to increase its fleet from 100 planes to 170 by
1999 to meet an expected increase in passengers.
   Kawamura said JAL had received five of the 747-400s planes by
March, and would receive the rest by 1999 ``if our plans are not
changed.''
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the orders would help reduce
Japan's trade surplus with the United States.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today vetoed a bill authorizing
funds for Amtrak, the nation's rail passenger service, protesting a
provision to bring railroad acquisitions under new government
scrutiny.
   Bush said the provision ``represents a step backward for the
entire rail industry.''
   It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He voted 10 measures last year
and has yet to have one overturned.
   An Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black, said the veto would have no
effect on daily train operations because the railroad is working
from money that Congress already appropriated for 1989-1992.
   But the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter
line being developed between Washington and its Northern Virginia
suburbs, Black said. The bill contained technical provisions that
were needed for the project to open.
   The bill also contained provisions that would have saved Amtrak
$16 million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for
railroad workers, Black said.
   ``We vigorously support an override of this veto,'' Black said.
   The provision that prompted the veto does not affect Amtrak
because it applies only to private freight rails, he added.
   In a veto message to Congress, Bush criticized a provision that
would require the government to review and approve proposed
acquisitions of railroads by non-railroad companies and
organizations.
   ``This new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of
the nation's largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or
to change existing capital structure,'' Bush said.
   He said that it would even subject to new scrutiny attempts to
take over a rail line by ``a carrier's own management or
employees.''
   ``This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to
financial restructuring of the railroad industry,'' Bush said.
   He said there is also adequate protection under existing law
``to protect the public interest in acquisition situations.''
   The provision would require Interstate Commerce Commission
approval of all railroad takeovers by non-railroad companies.
   The vetoed legislation, sent to Bush May 10, authorized the
government subsidy of Amtrak.
   It envisions more than $2 billion in federal money going to the
railroad over the three-year period between last Oct. 1 and Sept.
30, 1992. The actual amount would be determined as part of
Congress' annual appropriations process.
   Bush administration officials also complained that the bill
amounted to a government subsidy that amounts to about $29 a
passenger. However, the cost of the measure was not cited by Bush
in his veto message.

<HEAD>Japan Seeks to Promote Imports from Individual U.S. States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM MINEHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan agreed Thursday to send trade experts to Ohio
to help promote imports from that state, under a new strategy to
reduce trade friction by dealing with individual U.S. states.
   Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste signed the agreement with chairman
Minoru Masuda of the Japan External Trade Organization, which has
decided the state-based approach is Japan's best bet for reducing
its $49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   ``There is a difference in attitude between a state like Ohio
and Washington (D.C.),'' Celeste said in an interview. He said
Ohio, with nearly 200 Japanese-owned companies and annual exports
of nearly $1 billion to Japan, tends to see U.S.-Japan trade more
positively than the federal government, which blames Japanese
barriers for much of the trade imbalance.
   Masuda said he hoped the agreement with Ohio would result in a
``quantum leap'' in import promotion and set a precedent for other
states.
   JETRO will send Japanese trade experts to Ohio for one-year
stays to advise state and municipal trade officials and companies
that want to export to Japan.
   ``Their role will be particularly helpful to small- and
medium-sized companies who may have been intimidated by the
published reports on the barriers to trade in Japan,'' said Celeste.
   He said the advisers will help the companies overcome what he
called a lack of market knowledge and cultural differences that
have prevented many U.S. businesses from thriving in Japan.
   JETRO has signed a similar agreement with Indiana, and several
other states are being considered, said Fujiya Yamagata, the
organization's deputy director for import promotion. JETRO will
choose up to 15 states for the program, he said.
   Not only do state governments have a more positive attitude
toward trade with Japan, but also they are more knowledgeable about
their businesses and more eager to promote them, Yamagata said.
About 40 states have trade offices in Tokyo, he said, more than
have similar offices in Washington.
   The program, including an information network to help U.S.
companies increase exports, will cost the Japanese government $100
million, said Masahisa Naitoh of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.
   ``I'm convinced the measures will help reduce trade friction as
well as enhance the life quality of the Japanese people by
increasing the availability of goods,'' said Naitoh, director of
MITI's international trade administration bureau.
   Ohio is America's third-largest exporting state, but much of its
output is produced by Japanese companies. Honda sent 4,500
Ohio-built Accords to Japan in 1989 _ more cars than Ford, Chrysler
or General Motors, state officials said.
   Ford, in cooperation with Nissan, is spending $1 billion on
minivan production facilities near Cleveland. Japanese steel
companies Kobe, Kawasaki and Sumitomo are joining U.S. partners in
investing nearly $2 billion in Ohio's steel industry.
   During the past year, Japan has come under intense U.S. pressure
to open its markets wider to imports.
   Last year, the United States threatened retaliation by putting
Japan on a ``hit list'' of countries with the most offensive trade
barriers, branding Japan unfair in satellites, supercomputers and
forest products.
   In March, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu promised President George
Bush that easing trade tensions would be a top priority of his
government.
   The program to send experts to the states is part of an import
expansion agreement that MITI and the U.S Commerce Department
signed later in March. Japan also agreed then to provide tax
incentives for imports, eliminate tariffs on about 1,000 products
and provide more low-interest financing for imports.
   In April, the United States and Japan agreed to reduce trade
friction by making broad structural reforms in both economies.
   Japan also agreed to expand opportunities for sales of the U.S.
satellites, supercomputers and forest products cited under 1988
U.S. trade legislation. On April 27, the United States announced
that Japan would not be placed on the 1990 ``hit list.''

<HEAD>Gold Up Slightly; Dollar Strengthens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices staged a modest rebound Thursday
after a steep tumble in the previous session, but traders cautioned
that a full recovery would take time.
   Meanwhile, the dollar finished mostly higher in foreign exchange
trading.
   Activity was particularly quiet in U.S. precious metals markets,
where gold prices plunged more than $10 a troy ounce Wednesday,
when Saudi Arabia was believed to have sold between 10 tons and 30
tons of gold.
   In British and U.S. dealings Thursday, gold prices were up more
than $2 an ounce after falling in Asia. Several European markets
were closed in observance of Ascension Day.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose $2.40 a troy
ounce to settle at $366.50 after tumbling $11.50 an ounce
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $366.60 an ounce, up $2.65 an ounce.
   ``It was very, very quiet,'' said Steven Pepper, vice president
and bullion dealer at Republic National Bank. ``Everybody was
sitting on the sidelines ... (gold) traded in a very narrow range.''
   Pepper said market players took shelter on the sidelines in the
event the Saudis continue to liquidate their gold holdings.
``People are afraid to take long positions,'' he said.
   But John Norris, a vice president at Citibank, said he thinks
``the damage from the Saudis has been done.'' Still, he predicted
the building-back process would be rather slow, similar to the
month it took to recover from the $23-an-ounce drop in gold prices
in late March.
   ``We're going to be trading in some narrow ranges'' for a while,
Norris said.
   In European foreign exchange dealings, the dollar finished
mostly higher in dull trading as several markets were closed for
the religious holiday. But the pace quickened when trading shifted
to the United States.
   Much of the day's activity centered on the weakening of the West
German mark against the Japanese yen. Spurring the mark's decline
was a poll showing West Germans favor a slower reunification with
East Germany, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   ``The markets view this as unfavorable to the ruling party in
West Germany'' and are concerned about the potential for business
collaborations between the two Germanies, he added.
   The dollar got an additional push around midday when Assistant
Treasury Secretary Sidney Jones said the dollar was undervalued
against all currencies but the yen. The comment spurred traders to
sell marks and buy yen to adjust their dollar positions. Shortly
before the market closed, however, the Treasury said Jones's
comments were taken out of context.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.43 yen, up 0.08 yen from
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher at 151.55
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 151.15 yen, down from 151.45
yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6890 from $1.6975 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6910 to buy one pound, cheaper
than Wednesday's $1.6940.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6815 West German marks, up from
1.6760; 1.4235 Swiss francs, up from 1.4175; 5.6555 French francs,
up from 5.6400; 1,233.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.00, and 1.1844

   Assets of the nation's 503 money market mutual
funds rose $94.7 million to $381.41 billion in the latest week, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The increase for the seven-day period ended Wednesday snapped an
eight-week drop in fund assets that economists had attributed to
causes ranging from withdrawals for tax payments to an investor
shift into stocks and bonds.
   The institute said the rise followed a decline of $2.18 billion
in fund assets the previous week. That decline originally was
reported as $1.78 billion but the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group subsequently revised it.
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21. The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 242
general purpose funds fell $750.1 million to $129.48 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $703.4 million to
$159.13 billion, and assets of 159 institutional funds rose $141.4
million to $92.80 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds slipped
in the week ended Tuesday to 7.68 percent from 7.70 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield held at 7.68 percent, unchanged from
the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, the same as a week earlier, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts dipped to
6.21 percent as of Wednesday from 6.22 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.05 percent, the same as a week
earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.96
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.99
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.17 percent on 1-year CDs,
unchanged; 8.19 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.20 percent; and
8.20 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.21 percent.

   Stock prices suffered a small setback Thursday
as the latest statistics on economic growth blunted the market's
recent run of record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had reached new
closing peaks in each of the week's first three sessions, slipped
back .71 to 2,855.55.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 725 up, 791
down and 519 unchanged.
   As the business day began the Commerce Department reported that
the gross national product grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   The reduction in the figure, from a previous estimate of 2.1
percent, was larger than most analysts had been estimating.
   But the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of
business inventories rather than final sales.
   A shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear
sign of economic weakness, but rather as a possible portent of an
approaching pickup in production demand.
   Interest rates were unchanged to narrowly lower in the credit
markets following the news.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1 at 44&lsqb;. Brokers cited
a federal regulator's push to ban cigarette vending machines, as
well as news that the City University of New York and Harvard
University had decided to sell their tobacco stocks.
   Gainers among the blue chips included McDonald's, up 1 at 35&lsqb;;
Eastman Kodak, up ~ at 41{; Westinghouse Electric, up ~ at 35|;
Boeing, up 1{ at 82|, and Coca-Cola, up { at 45&rsqb;.
   Motorola climbed 3} to 83}. The company's cellular telephone
technology business got two boosts in Japan with an order for
equipment and the selection of its speech decoder as an industry
standard in that nation.
   U.S. Shoe, which reported sharply higher quarterly earnings,
climbed 1 to 24{.
   Compaq Computer slipped ~ to 122 after trading at a new high of
124. The company plans a 2-for-1 stock split.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.14 million
shares, down from 172.33 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 190.32 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $3.72 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .38 to 195.47.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .87 to 418.45, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .88 at 358.41.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.42 to 458.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.76, up 1.11.

   Crude oil futures prices declined while gasoline
futures advanced Thursday as traders reacted to developments in the
spot market for both fuels.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 31 cents to $17.83 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Subsequent months also
declined.
   The spot market for crude was weak Thursday, and the bearish
tone spilled into the futures market, said Andrew Lebow, a senior
broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Meanwhile, gasoline futures surged higher. The June contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.72 cent to 63.23 cents a gallon,
and the July contract posted a 1.05-cents gain to 61.37 cents a
gallon.
   Lebow said the advance reflected higher prices on the spot
market, where traders were snapping up gasoline because of tight
supplies in the Gulf Coast.
   Home heating oil, which usually declines in warmer weather,
followed that trend. The June contract was down 0.40 cent a gallon
to 49.81 cents, and the July contract also settled lower.
   Natural gas prices declined as well. The June contract fell to
$1.600 per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.602 on Wednesday.

   GTE Corp. and Thorn EMI of Great Britain
announced Thursday that they are discussing the global lighting
industry and that those talks could lead to GTE acquiring Thorn
Lighting.
   Both companies said the worldwide demand for lamps and fixtures
of advanced technology and design requires increasingly high levels
of investment.
   They said there is growing pressure to achieve
cost-competitiveness by scaling down research and development,
manufacturing and marketing to develop strong positions in the
world's key lighting markets.
   Thorn EMI is an international company operating in the music,
lighting and technology industries. It generated sales of more than
$5.1 billion in the year ended March 31, 1989, and reported a
profit of over $488 million.
   GTE's three core businesses are telecommunications, lighting and
precision materials. It had sales of $17.4 billion in 1989 and net
income of $1.4 billion.

   The Bush administration on Thursday called on
states to help stop children and teen-agers from smoking by banning
cigarette vending machines and licensing tobacco retailers.
   ``We must put an end to the time when any child with a handful
of change can commence the slow-motion suicide that is taking the
lives of millions of Americans,'' Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan told senators.
   Sullivan proposed the model federal legislation to guide state
lawmakers in creating a licensing system similar to that used for
alcoholic beverages and in outlawing cigarette vending machines.
   ``You can't buy beer from a vending machine,'' he said in
testimony prepared for the Senate Finance Committee, ``why should
you be able to purchase cigarettes there?''
   Also, signs would be required at all points of sale warning that
cigarette sales to minors is illegal.
   The plan would punish violators with fines and license
suspensions.
   Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have laws
prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors. But ``these laws are
being blatantly ignored,'' the secretary said.
   The states that do not have laws are: Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming.
   Sullivan, who has become the federal government's crusader
against smoking, released a report by the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services documenting the widespread
lack of enforcement of the state laws.
   The few communities that have successfully enforced the laws
have done so by licensing tobacco vendors, suspending and revoking
licenses, banning or restricting vending machines and using
``stings'' to identify illegal sales, the report said.
   Vending machines account for 16 percent of the cigarettes sold
to minors, according to the report.
   But the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association, which
represents the vending industry, said only about 9 percent of
minors who smoke get their cigarettes from vending machines.
   Also, 80 percent of the 375,000 cigarette vending machines are
in places where minors are prohibited or are unlikely to frequent,
such as bars, offices and universities, the group said.
   Sullivan said 90 percent of adult smokers picked up the habit as
children or adolescents.
   ``These young smokers account for almost all of our future
problems,'' he said. ``As long as a significant proportion of teens
view smoking as a desirable, adult pleasure, and become addicted
before they can make a mature judgment, we will never succeed in
eradicating smoking.''
   Sullivan said it is ``more appropriate'' to build on the
legislation already on the books in 44 states than to have a
federal ban on vending machines and a national licensing system.
   He also suggested states could phase in a ban on vending
machines by first restricting them to nightclubs and bars where
children are not permitted.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last week passed
a $110-million-a-year anti-smoking bill that would encourage states
to enforce laws prohibiting the cigarette sales to minors. The
measure also includes incentives for states to restrict vending
machines and money to finance programs and advertisements to
educate Americans about the dangers of smoking.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chief sponsor of the bill, said
Sullivan's proposal was ``a half-hearted plan'' that is ``certain
to be ineffective.''
   ``The White House tactic of paying lip service to important
national goals while rejecting federal action is irresponsible,''
Kennedy said in a statement. ``We cannot simply dump our major
national problems on the states.''
   The Coalition on Smoking or Health _ formed by the American
Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the American
Cancer Society _ commended Sullivan's effort, but said his plan
``fails to put any teeth into efforts to combat a national
problem.''
   Sullivan's plan puts ``the burden on 50 states to enact and
enforce 50 different laws,'' the group said.
   Charles O. Whitley of the Tobacco Institute said the proposal
would not work any better than the similar system used to keep
alcoholic beverages away from teen-agers. He also said existing
laws aren't being enforced because they lack widespread support.
   ``Laws that have popular public support are enforced,'' he said.
``Those that don't have popular public support are rarely
enforced.''
   Sullivan's model legislation suggests the legal age for buying
cigarettes should be set at 19, to keep cigarettes further away
from high school students.
   Licensing fees would be $300 for most stores but $50 for stores
with tobacco sales below $5,000. At these rates, states could raise
enough money to offset the costs for enforcement.
   Unlicensed sale or distribution of tobacco products would mean a
fine of up to $1,000 and jail for up to 30 days. Penalties for
violations by licensed retailers and their employees would begin at
$100 for the first offense and rise to $1,000 and suspension of
their license for up to 18 months for a fourth offense. Licenses of
persistent offenders could be revoked.

<HEAD>Money Supply Down In Latest Reporting Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended May 14, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,266.5 billion from a revised $3,271.5 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,064.1 billion from a revised $4,068.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $802.9 billion from a revised $806.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.3 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.8 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,266.8 billion, a 5.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,065.9 billion, up 2.2 percent, while M1
rose 5.4 percent to an average of $805.3 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $943 million in
the week ended May 16.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $327 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$319 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $666
million in the two weeks ended May 16, down from a revised $866
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $306.0 billion in the two-week period ended May
16, up from $305.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd.
said half its shareholders sold their small stake in BAT Industries
PLC on Thursday while the other half decided to keep their shares
as a long-term investment.
   Hoylake was created by Goldsmith, an Anglo-French financier,
with British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild, Australian
businessman Kerry Packer and other investors for the sole purpose
of launching last year's hostile takeover bid for the British
conglomerate.
   Hoylake last month abandoned the 13.4 billion-pound, $22.6
billion offer for BAT, which got bogged down in regulatory wrangles
in the United States.
   Half of Hoylake's 1.25 percent stake in BAT, or about 9.5
million shares, were sold Thursday in London at market prices, a
Hoylake spokesman said.
   BAT shares finished 19 pence, or 32 cents, higher Thursday at
703 pence, or $11.88, on the London Stock Exchange. A total of 25
million shares changed hands during the day.
   The Hoylake spokesman said half the Hoylake shareholders decided
to keep their stake as a long-term investment, while the other half
chose to dispose of their shares because Hoylake is to be
dismantled.

   Corporate after-tax profits rose 0.2 percent
in the first quarter of 1990, a slim increase that marked the
second consecutive rise after three quarters of decline, the
government said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said profits after taxes increased $3
million to $157 billion on top of a 2.8 percent increase in the
October-December period of 1989.
   After-tax profits had fallen 1.1 percent in the first quarter of
last year, 7.2 percent in the second and 5.4 percent in the third.
   A broader measure _ before-tax profits adjusted for depreciation
and inventories _ inched 0.7 percent higher in the last quarter to
an annual rate of $287.8 billion.
   This measure fell during each of the quarters in 1989 and ended
the year down 8.3 percent. It was the first annual decrease since a
0.1 percent drop in 1986 and the largest since a 20.2 percent loss
in 1982 during the last recession.
   Dividends increased 2.0 percent to $128.1 billion after gains of
1.9 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, 2.0
percent in the second and 2.9 percent in the first.

   Ivan F. Boesky deducted $50 million in
government penalties from his income taxes, the former stock
speculator testified Thursday at the securities fraud trial of his
one-time associate John A. Mulheren Jr.
   In Boesky's third day on the witness stand, the defense again
sought to undermine his credibility and to portray him as a greedy
man who transferred chunks of his fortune to his wife when a
federal dragnet closed on him in 1986.
   Mulheren is accused of breaking the law to help Boesky cheat on
his taxes and evade federal securities laws.
   The trial recessed until Tuesday after prosecutors began
questioning Michael Davidoff, Boesky's chief trader. Davidoff, who
has pleaded guilty to a securities charge and agreed to cooperate
with the government, testified briefly Thursday that he met
Mulheren 10 to 15 years ago and had occasional social and business
dealings with him.
   Earlier, U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum granted a
request by defense attorney Thomas P. Puccio for information about
whether Boesky took a tax deduction for the $100 million he paid to
settle the government's sweeping insider trading case against him.
   At a conference in the judge's chambers, Boesky lawyer Charles
Davidow said Boesky deducted $50 million of the penalty on his 1986
personal income tax statement. Boesky paid that $50 million as
disgorgement of illegal profits he reaped from insider trading in
1985.
   Davidow said he did not know whether the deduction _ taken as a
capital expense _ was legal, but he assumed Boesky's tax attorneys
or accountants had reviewed it at the time.
   Cedarbaum allowed defense attorneys to discuss the deduction
during cross examination, but only in attempting to show that the
penalty against Boesky was not as painful or expensive as it
appeared.
   During Thursday's cross-examination by Puccio, Boesky also
confirmed the deduction but said he could not remember specific
amounts of illegal profits he made in 1985. Puccio claimed illegal
profits based on insider information from investment bankers Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel actually totaled $187 million.
   In response to another question, Boesky said he did not agree
with the proposition that ``Greed is healthy.'' He also said he
could not remember his words from a speech at the University of
California at Berkeley, in which Puccio said Boesky indicated that
``one can be greedy and still feel good about oneself.''
   Boesky also said that money had ``far less consequence than you
might think'' to him.
   Puccio has been attacking Boesky's credibility as he defends
Mulheren against 41 charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and record-keeping violations.
   Boesky fingered Mulheren, a former stock speculator at Jamie
Securities, and others as part of his 1986 plea agreement that
settled Wall Street's biggest insider trading case.
   In addition to paying $100 million to settle the case, Boesky
pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge and spent two years in
prison.
   Boesky was temperamental under cross-examination, again refusing
to answer many questions unless he saw documentation to refresh his
memory.
   Puccio asked him a dozen times whether he had revealed to the
government all of the crimes he ever committed. Boesky said he
revealed all the crimes required under the plea bargain.
   He acknowledged his net worth fell from at least $100 million in
1986 to nearly nothing when he was sentenced in late 1987, but
would not say whether he transferred funds to his wife, as Puccio
hinted.
   ``I do not recall any financial activities of 1986,'' he said
repeatedly.
   Boesky denied he did anything illegal with his money to avoid
having to pay $1 billion in damages to parties that are suing him.
   Boesky did admit one violation. Responding to Puccio's question
about whether he broke the law while in prison, Boesky said he
violated a rule by paying someone else to do his laundry.
   ``There were a couple of chaps who did laundry there and I gave
them a few quarters to do my laundry,'' he said.
   He said he did not commit any other wrongdoing while in the
minimum security prison, in Lompoc, Calif.
   Under questioning Wednesday by prosecutors, Boesky implicated
Mulheren in a scheme to raise the price of stock in the former Gulf
&amp; Western Inc. so Boesky could sell his 3.4 million shares above
the then-market price. Prosecutors allege Mulheren manipulated the
price at Boesky's request.
   On Tuesday, Boesky said Mulheren agreed to keep 330,000 shares
of stock in Unocal Corp. so that Boesky could cheat on his taxes
and meet federal requirements governing the minimum amount of
capital his brokerage firm needed to operate.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's blueprint for
dismantling a centrally planned economy is too timid and too
fragmented to succeed, several Western analysts said Thursday.
   In short, they criticized it for a lack of centralized planning.
   ``You can't have halfway reform,'' said Ljubo Sirc, director of
the independent Center of Research into Communist Economies in
London.
   But Gorbachev's government is in a bind because it lacks the
support of the Soviet people to push for even more radical therapy
for a sick economy, the analysts said.
   ``This is a double catch. On one hand, the population is opposed
to reforms. That's why Gorbachev goes slowly. On the other hand,
for the success of reforms, you need radical change and Gorbachev
is not quite ready to take this step,'' Sirc said in a telephone
interview.
   It is as if Britain decided to switch from driving on the left
to driving on the right, and proposed to do that a few cars at a
time, said David Mars, an economist at the London investment firm
S.G. Warburg and Co. Ltd.
   ``We're likely to see that this type of reform almost gets the
worst of both worlds,'' Mars said.
   In Boston, Harvard University's Marshall Goldman agreed with the
negative assessment but said there was very little Gorbachev could
have done about the catastrophic economic situation.
   ``He's lost credibility. His situation has deteriorated so
much,'' Goldman said in a telephone interview. ``The methods that
he should have used _ markets, family farming, joint ventures _
have gotten off to such a bad start.''
   He said the latest economic plan ``moves him one step closer''
to falling from power.
   Andrew Setton, a director of Morgan Grenfell and Co. in London,
has said on BBC television that reforms to date add up to ``a
certain amount of economic chaos and a lack of visible management
of the whole economy at the center.''
   However, P.J. Wiles, a professor at the London School of
Economics, said the reform appeared to be radical. Economic changes
such as large-scale privatization are too complex to implement
quickly.
   The proposed five-year plan is a compromise between the
decades-old centrally planned economy _ under which Moscow set
virtually all prices and wages _ and radical plans for a
Polish-style ``shock-therapy'' to shift to a market economy over
two years.
   The government has proposed the Soviet Union's first national
referendum on the plan, which Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov presented to
the Supreme Soviet on Thursday. He warned of high unemployment and
inflation during an expected two-year recession.
   No date for the referendum was set.
   Soviet lawmakers are divided about the cures for numerous
economic ills. Wages are soaring in the double digits while
industrial production has dropped significantly. The country has a
huge budget deficit, is strapped with debt and has a poor credit
rating on international financial markets.
   The standard of living is about 20 percent that of the United
States. Shortages are chronic and consumers wait in long,
demoralizing lines to buy the few goods available.
   Gorbachev has blamed public opinion for retarding reform.
   The public is hostile to change, Sirc argued, because
Gorbachev's reforms so far have made things worse. And many Soviets
still rate the collective good ahead of individual wealth.
   Even a national vote in favor of the reform would not be a
solution, Mars said. ``When the pain starts to be evident,'' he
said, ``how much legitimacy does Gorbachev have?''
   Soviet officials describe the new system as a regulated market,
because wage and price controls would be lifted gradually, and not
all state businesses would be sold.
   The plan sets target price increases for various sectors of the
economy and would at least double the price of many foods Jan. 1.
Wages and other compensation would rise, but not keep pace.
   Later, many companies would be turned into share-issuing
concerns that eventually would be owned by investors. Inefficient
businesses would be closed and unprofitable ones would go bankrupt.
   The actual transfer of ownership of companies and a sharp
reduction of central control should occur in 1993-1995, Ryzhkov
said.
   The Soviet Union should be guided by the failure of Hungary's
half-hearted reforms, Mars said. On the other hand, Sirc said:
``The Polish government has ended up in quite a dangerous situation
because in spite of the very radical reforms, the results haven't
shown up yet.''
   That's why price reform and institutional restructuring, like
privatization, must take place at the same time, Setton argued
Tuesday, when Gorbachev's advisory Presidential Council approved
the plan.
   ``I think the problem may be one of timing,'' Setton told the
BBC. ``You could run into difficulty because people will simply not
see where the austerity is leading.''

   Lech Walesa says he never thought that
agreeing to do an advertisement supporting the U.S. Bill of Rights
would be seen as an endorsement of cigarette smoking _ a habit he
kicked cold turkey years ago.
   But now aides say the Solidarity chairman and Nobel Peace Prize
laureate is contending with some unforeseen ``doubts'' in Poland
and abroad in connection with an ad he did for the Philip Morris
Cos., makers of Marlboro cigarettes.
   Walesa's full-page photograph and comments in praise of the Bill
of Rights are appearing in such magazines as Time, Newsweek,
Business Week and People. They are part of a $60 million campaign
by the tobacco, food and beverage conglomerate to celebrate the
200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
   Critics, including some consumer and health groups, have charged
what Philip Morris really aims for is to subtly build appreciation
for its products and to create a link in people's minds between
constitutional freedoms and the right to smoke in public.
   A Polish newspaper claimed Wednesday that many Americans ``are
surprised'' Walesa would lend his image to such an endeavor. ``It
is not known if this controversy is worth the fee,'' it added.
   Any implied criticism of Walesa's judgment is sensitive now for
his aides because of domestic politics. Walesa is believed to be
laying the groundwork to run for president, and critics are
suggesting the humbly-born shipyard electrician is too
unsophisticated to represent Poland in the office.
   Walesa's spokesman, Jaroslaw Kurski, said his boss was unaware
of any controversy around the Philip Morris ads when he agreed to
lend his name to the campaign last year.
   ``Lech Walesa's intention was not to advertise Philip Morris
products but only to popularize the idea of freedom and civil
liberties contained in the Bill of Rights,'' Kurski said in a
telephone interview from Gdansk.
   ``The proof of this statement is that Lech Walesa has never
agreed to advertise any products or anyone's business activity.''
   The advertisement carries a quote from the union leader saying:
``I've read your Bill of Rights a hundred times and I'll probably
read it a hundred more before I die.''
   Asked about the ads, a New York spokesman for Philip Morris said
Thursday they were not intended to promote the company's products.
   ``The purpose of the advertisement is to celebrate the Bill of
Rights and the sentiments and principles they represent, about
which Mr. Walesa was more than happy to express his views and
admiration thereof,'' said George Knox, vice president of public
affairs, in a telephone interview.
   ``The purpose of the ad campaign is not to promote our products.
No mention of our product has ever been made,'' he said.
   Walesa agreed to do the campaign in return for a fee of $20,000
to $25,000 to be donated to charity, said Kurski, who said he did
not remember the exact sum. Philip Morris has declined to specify
the amount.
   Walesa maintains a philanthropic fund administered by trustees
that distributes money he receives for human rights activities. For
instance, the $200,000 he received for his 1983 Nobel Prize
recently went to modernize a hospital serving workers at the Gdansk
shipyard, where Solidarity was born.
   Walesa is definitely opposed to linking the Bill of Rights to
the right to light up, Kurski said.
   Although Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel is often seen
fidgeting for his cigarettes, and Poland's Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and Labor Minister Jacek Kuron were rarely sighted in
their dissident days without a smoke, Walesa _ prone to high blood
pressure _ kicked the habit about six years ago.
   ``He gave it up overnight and since then I have never seen him
smoking,'' Kurski said. ``He is an enemy of smoking.''
   Asked whether Walesa felt exploited by Philip Morris, Kurski
said he preferred to call it ``a misunderstanding.''
   ``You might say the will of the two sides was not coordinated.''

<HEAD>Koito Board Rejects Pickens Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Koito Manufacturing Co.
has recommended rejection of seven proposals by Texas oilman and
investor T. Boone Pickens, a spokesman for the Japanese auto parts
company said.
   Pickens, Koito's biggest shareholder, called the rejection
``another example of what's wrong with corporate Japan.''
   Pickens has been battling Koito since buying 26 percent of its
common stock. He has sought representation on the board of
directors and access to company books.
   Koito has responded with accusations that Pickens is after
``greenmail,'' the practice of buying back shares from an
unfriendly stockholder at a premium over market price.
   Pickens claims Toyota Motor Co., Koito's second largest
stockholder and main customer, is orchestrating the battle to keep
him out. He claims Toyota forces Koito to sell it parts at low
prices.
   Following a regular meeting in Tokyo Thursday, Koito spokesman
Kenichi Matsuura said the board voted to recommend that
shareholders turn down Pickens on all his requests during next
month's annual meeting.
   Besides seeking four seats on Koito's board, Pickens has
proposed the company adopt an ``anti-greenmail'' corporate bylaw,
include in its annual report any possible unfair trade practices,
allow shareholders to vote annually on individual directors' pay
and bonuses, publicize its pricing criteria, boost dividends and
report on the expenditure from a separate corporate fund.
   Pickens said he and 50 other U.S. shareholders in Koito will
attend the June 28 annual meeting in Tokyo. He said Koito has not
responded to his requests for tours of Koito plants, meeting with
other major shareholders or translators.

   President Bush said Thursday that Congress is
the primary culprit for the burgeoning federal deficit, igniting
angry Democratic complaints that the White House has failed to
provide leadership in the effort to reduce red ink.
   ``People understand the Congress bears the greater
responsibility for this,'' Bush said at a White House news
conference. ``But I'm not trying to assign blame.''
   Democrats called for him to come up with budget proposals rather
than comments about blame and said his remarks ``are not going to
help.''
   Bush spoke shortly before administration officials and leading
lawmakers held another three-hour round of private
deficit-reduction talks that participants described as testy.
   The bargaining is in its early stages, with the two sides trying
to agree on the size of the problem and on how much savings they
should seek.
   Negotiators are moving toward a consensus to try to reduce the
budget gap by $45 billion to $60 billion next year and from $425
billion to $600 billion over five years, bargainers said.
   But disagreements remain. Republicans favor reductions in the
lower end of those ranges, while Democrats are seeking higher cuts,
the participants said. Both sides agree that the higher the
savings, the more likely it is that new taxes will be needed _
threatening Bush's campaign pledge to shun new taxes.
   ``There was a substantial disparity,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., a negotiator.
   Administration negotiators also distributed new estimates of the
potential costs of rescuing the nation's savings and loan industry.
They showed that over the next six years, the bailout could cost
from $102.5 billion to $154.7 billion.
   A day earlier, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress
the government will have to borrow between $90 billion and $130
billion to clean up the S&amp;L mess. Unlike Brady's figures, the
numbers released Thursday included the government's interest costs
for borrowing the funds.
   The administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk
of the problem could be resolved with the $50 billion in borrowing
authority included in the S&amp;L bailout bill.
   The budget bargaining has been played out against a constant
background din of political sniping.
   In Thursday's installment, Bush again refused Democratic demands
that he address the nation to prepare Americans for the tax
increases or deep spending cuts budget negotiators may propose. He
pointed out that Congress has the authority to pass revenue and
spending bills.
   The president said the talks are ``on the right track.'' He said
that once bargainers produce a budget package, ``I'm going to go
out and say to the American people, `Here's what we recommend.'''
   Democrats responded immediately.
   Bush ``should recommend what he believes is needed now,'' said
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   ``He has the responsibility to recommend to Congress budget
proposals,'' said Foley, D-Wash.
   Democrats noted that the House approved a $1.2 trillion 1991
budget on May 1 over unanimous Republican opposition. The GOP
decided to not seek a vote on the spending plan Bush proposed in
January, calling it out of date.
   ``We've put down a budget, we've passed a budget, the president
hasn't done any of that,'' said House Budget Committee member
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``The only thing he's done is call for a
summit, which means Democrats should come help him.''
   Schumer added, ``Statements like he said are not going to help
the talks.''
   ``The president is elected to lead,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., a member of the House Democratic leadership. ``The
president needs to tell us what we need to do and why.''
   Bush, at the news conference, said, ``You're going to always
have some people on the fringes sniping at you. That goes with this
territory.''
   Republicans leaped to his defense. Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, the No. 2 House GOP leader, said Democrats should study
the Constitution.
   ``If they read the Constitution, they will realize they have
massive responsibilities on taxes and spending,'' Gingrich said.
   The ranking Republican on the House budget panel, Bill Frenzel
of Minnesota, said he believes Congress bears most of the
responsibility for the problem but that the White House ``can share
some of that blame.''
   He said the latest partisan outbursts were merely ``part of the
political process'' that would have little effect on the talks.
   ``There are going to be some hurt feelings out there, but I
don't think it's that big a deal,'' said Frenzel, who is one of the
budget negotiators.
   The Bush administration said in January that next year's deficit
would be $100.5 billion. Citing gloomier economic numbers and
growing costs of the savings and loan industry rescue, the White
House now says the shortfall could range from $123 billion to $199
billion.

   A steady increase in highway travel will
continue this summer as a record number of Americans take auto
vacations, travel experts say.
   The American Automobile Association and the U.S. Travel Data
Center forecast a 2 percent increase in road trips over last summer
_ from 322 million ``person-trips'' to 329 million.
   A person-trip is one individual taking one trip of more than 100
miles. Five people traveling in one vehicle would count as five
person-trips.
   Expected summer travel in 1990 represents a 28 percent increase
over 1982, said Suzanne Cook, executive director of the U.S. Travel
Data Center, at a news conference Wednesday.
   A record 270 million person-trips are expected to be taken
between Memorial Day and Labor Day, up more than 2 percent from
last year's 264 million.
   AAA and the data center usually make their summer travel
predictions from Washington. But this year, the two groups decided
to make the announcement from Universal Studios Florida, the new
tourist attraction which has its official opening June 7.
   About 60 percent of the tourists arriving in Florida come by
auto during the summer months, according to the Florida Division of
Tourism. The state counted more than 30 million tourists last year.

<HEAD>Columbia Savings Junk Bond Proponent Severs Final Ties With
Institution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Spiegel, the Michael Milken
ally whose Columbia Savings amassed the biggest junk-bond hoard of
any thrift, is cutting all ties with the insolvent S&amp;L, Columbia's
new chief said Thursday.
   Spiegel, a former Wall Street bond trader, earned $9 million in
salary and bonuses in 1985 at Columbia. He resigned as chief
executive on Dec. 31 as the thrift incurred hundreds of millions of
dollars in losses on its portfolio of the high-yield, high-risk
securities.
   He had continued to work as a Columbia consultant seeking to
find a buyer for the bonds. They are valued currently at $2.9
billion, down from $4.3 billion at the end of 1988.
   Columbia says eight parties, including Bankers Trust, General
Electric Capital Corp. and Chicago's Pritzker family, remain
interested in the portfolio.
   Columbia's chief executive, Edward G. Harshfield, has said he
hopes to announce a sale of the bonds by early July. With bidding
in the final stages, the thrift thought it best to sever ties with
Spiegel, whose high pay and maverick investments in junk bonds had
alienated regulators.
   Columbia revealed in a recent filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that regulators forced Spiegel to return
$600,000 in 1988 pay and forgo another $500,000 he was to have
received as a consultant.
   ``Tom Spiegel had done a great job of teeing up this
transaction,'' Harshfield, who was traveling Thursday, said in a
statement.
   ``However, everyone associated with our efforts to sell our bond
portfolio, including Tom, agreed that this was the right time for
management to take full control over the bidding and negotiation
process.''
   Spiegel was foremost among a network of buyers at thrifts who
purchased junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert, the brokerage
where Milken pioneered use of the bonds.
   Drexel has collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings. Milken, whose
office was just a few blocks from Columbia's headquarters in
Beverly Hills, has pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay
$600 million to settle fraud charges.
   Columbia reported last week that nearly a quarter-billion
dollars in retail deposits have been withdrawn since last month,
when it reported it had lost $591 million in 1989 because of the
weak market for junk bonds.
   The thrift does not meet federal requirements for capital _ its
cushion against losses _ and it has been insolvent since Feb. 28,
with liabilities exceeding assets by $215.6 million as of March 31.
   Regulators could seize it at any time but have chosen not to do
so, a move widely interpreted as a desire not to inherit the junk
bond portfolio.
   Columbia officials maintain it may be possible to avoid seizure.
   But many industry observers, such as Alexandria, Va.-based
financial industry consultant Bert Ely, say there no longer appears
to be any question of whether Columbia will be seized, only when.
   ``They're not going to come back,'' Ely said. ``The feeling is
they gambled recklessly, and Spiegel's paychecks for a couple of
years there in a row created a lot of negativism.''
   With two-thirds of Columbia's deposits coming from high-cost
brokered sources and low-cost retail deposits flowing out, recent
signs of recovery in the junk-bond market won't be enough to avert
seizure, he said.
   ``The junk bond market may be coming back, but I don't think
it's coming back to the extent to be able to take care of their
problems,'' Ely said.

   A.W. Clausen, ending a chapter in one of
the financial industry's most dramatic comebacks, formally passed
on the leadership of BankAmerica Corp. to Richard Rosenberg
Thursday.
   Clausen forecast a ``fantastic'' future for the banking giant he
led from 1970 to 1981 and returned to rescue in 1986.
   Problems of overexpansion at home and losses on third world
loans sent BankAmerica into a freefall in the mid 1980s. The bank
chalked up $1.9 billion in losses over three years through 1987,
prompting Clausen to sell off many operations and focus on its core
retail and corporate banking business.
   ``The gears are finally going to get in mesh,'' Clausen said at
a news conference before opening his last annual meeting as
BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Clausen, 67, told about 700 shareholders he is leaving ``with
sadness, yet with considerable satisfaction'' after seeing profits
rebound to $726 million in 1988 and a record $1.1 billion in 1989.
   He recalled the successful fight to stave off an unsolicited
takeover offer from First Interstate Bancorp. and the sales of
numerous assets, including the Charles Schwab discount brokerage.
   BankAmerica now is poised to ``flesh out'' its markets with more
acquisitions of its own, Clausen said. It is determined to be the
premier retail and wholesale bank in the West, including Arizona,
Nevada, Oregon, Washington and California.
   Clausen, who headed the World Bank from 1981 to 1986, said
BankAmerica also is in position to rebuild its international
presence under the guidance of Rosenberg, 59.
   ``There will be challenges,'' said Clausen, who announced his
retirement in January. ``The issue of Third World debt still looms
large, although the progress made in recent years is undeniable.
And some of our best markets continue to be targeted by a host of
non-bank competitors, operating under different rules other than
what commercial bank labor under.''
   Clausen said the 1990s will be ``perhaps the most competitively
demanding and economically rigorous decade any of us have seen.''
   Asked if he had any advice to the financial industry, in view of
the savings and loan debacle and numerous bank failures, Clausen
put down fancy finagling and stressed an emphasis on the basics.
   ``My advice to the financial industry is that two and two always
should equal four,'' he said. ``The institutions that try to make
five or six out of two and two are the ones that are paying the
price.
   ``It's the fundamentals of the business _ watch expenses, watch
revenues. Quality will tell everything. And be prepared for the
downsides as well. It's kind of easy to do things when everything
is going up.''

<HEAD>Matsushita Reported Planning to Build Headquarters in Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Matsushita group, Japan's biggest consumer
electronics company, has decided to set up a corporate headquarters
in Texas and invest more than $661 million there, Japanese news
reports said.
   Major Japanese newspapers and news services reported Wednesday
that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has decided to go ahead
with a plan to build the ``Panasonic Corporate Campus'' on a 17.75
million square-foot plot in Fort Worth.
   Panasonic is Matsushita's best known brand name.
   The plan involves coordinated investment by several Matsushita
group companies specializing in computer and communication
technology, including Matsushita Communication Industrial Co. and
Matsushita Graphic Communication Systems Inc., the reports said.
   Plans for the corporate campus have been rumored in the Japanese
press since early this year.
   Company officials acknowledge that the company plans to make a
major investment abroad but say no formal decision has yet been
made.
   The newspaper Sankei Shimbun said Matsushita initially plans to
build computer and facsimile factories at the site and then expand
gradually, inviting other group companies to build plants nearby.
When complete, Matsushita's Texas base would make products spanning
the entire range of technology in the computer and communications
fields and is expected to be Japan's largest investment overseas,
the newspaper said.
   Matsushita officials also hope to develop various athletic and
recreation facilities at the site and even housing for its workers,
it said.
   Also Wednesday, company officials announced that the 163
companies in the Matsushita group posted record consolidated sales
of 6.00 trillion yen ($39.7 billion) in the year ended March 31, up
9 percent from fiscal 1988. Net profits rose 10.3 percent to 235.56
billion yen ($1.56 billion).
