   A judge dropped charges Monday against a
farmer after the suburban neighbors who filed complaints against
him, saying he ran a noisy tractor at night, failed to show up in
court.
   However, Cook County Judge John McBride ruled the two counts of
disturbing the peace against Ray Dettmering could be reinstated if
the neighbors show they had a valid reason for missing the hearing,
said David Brauer, village prosecutor in Matteson.
   ``It's like 90 percent dead,'' Brauer said of the case. ``Both
citizens were advised to be here, and they chose not to show.''
   Dettmering, 28, was arrested late the night of April 26 after
neighbors complained about noise from a plow operating on 60 acres
of leased farmland in Matteson south of Chicago.
   If convicted of both counts, he could have a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   Farming supporters quickly seized the case as an example of the
continuing conflict between suburban dwellers moving out of the
cities and farmers working land right next to the new subdivisions.
   Neither citizen who signed the complaint returned phone calls to
their homes Monday. But both said earlier they didn't know a farmer
was involved and neither planned to show up in court Monday.
   ``I would not have signed the complaint if I'd known he was a
farmer,'' Doris Norton said. ``I thought he was a construction
foreman for a builder.''
   Even though things have worked out in his favor, Dettmering said
the issue still isn't resolved because the court gave no direct
ruling on whether he could plow at night.
   He indicated that he'll take his chances. ``I guess it's OK to
get back out there,'' he said from the shop in nearby Peotone where
he works as a mechanic during the day.
   But farming officials said the conflict will continue between
suburban residents seeking the quiet, pastoral life and working
farmers who know it isn't always like that on the north forty.
   ``People who move out into the country are less tolerant of
agricultural practices,'' said Bryan Petrucci, Midwest director for
the American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit agency seeking to preserve
the nation's agricultural acreage. ``Without more right-to-farm
legislation, we will only have more trouble.''

   A 28-year-old man facing trial for the
murders of three young boys and the attempted murder of a fourth
changed his plea to guilty Monday without explanation.
   Westley Allan Dodd, of Vancouver has been held without bail
since his arrest Nov. 13, when he pleaded innocent to the charges.
   Jury selection will begin as scheduled on June 25, but only in a
consolidated penalty phase for all the cases. Dodd faces the death
penalty or mandatory life in prison without parole.
   Dodd did not indicate why he changed his plea. Clark County
Prosecuting Attorney Arthur D. Curtis said Dodd went against the
advice of his attorneys.
   ``We don't feel it was a plea bargain in any respect,'' said
Curtis. ``He plead guilty to what he was charged with.''
   Dodd softly and somberly described to Clark County Superior
Court Judge Robert Harris the three boys' deaths in graphic detail.
   Dodd was charged with three counts of first-degree aggravated
murder in the deaths of 4-year-old Lee Joseph Iseli of Portland,
Ore., and Vancouver brothers Cole Neer, 11, and William Neer, 10.
   The Neer brothers' bodies were found Sept. 4 in a Vancouver park
where they had ridden their bicycles. Both had been stabbed.
   The Iseli boy's body was discovered near Vancouver Lake Nov. 1,
three days after he disappeared from a Portland schoolyard.
   ``On Sept. 4, 1989, I went to David Douglas Park with the
premeditated intent to cause the death of another human being,''
Dodd told Harris. ``I raped Cole Neer and then I killed him. Yes, I
also murdered William Neer ... to conceal my identity.''
   On Oct. 29, Dodd said, ``I did kidnap Lee Iseli from Portland
Ore., took him to my apartment in Vancouver and raped him. ... And
on the morning of Oct. 30, I murdered Lee Iseli.''
   Dodd was arrested after he carried 6-year-old James Kirk II from
a Camas, Wash., movie theater. Although the boy was let go outside
the theater, his mother's boyfriend tracked Dodd down and brought
him back.
   ``I did attempt to abduct and murder James Kirk,'' Dodd told
Harris.
   Dodd was charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree
attempted murder in that case. The kidnapping charge was dropped
Monday.
   Robert Iseli, whose son was one of those killed, said he hoped
Dodd would get the death penalty. ``You shoot a rabid dog ... and
anyone else who has no value to society,'' he said.

   Classroom teachers want input on designing
curriculums, selecting principals, choosing textbooks and spending
school funds, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday.
   ``Teachers overwhelmingly want more say in everything,'' said
Donna Rhodes, director of the National Foundation for the
Improvement of Education, one of several groups that sponsored the
study.
   The poll found that teachers believe they can make a difference
in changing overall education policy and reforming the educational
system on virtually all levels, if given the opportunity. It was
released as a gathering of education and business leaders
recognized 115 elementary and secondary school teachers from 23
areas.
   Sixty-three percent of the respondents said they believed they
could influence change in their own school ``a great deal.''
Another 35 percent said a ``fair amount,'' while 2 percent said
``not very much.''
   Ninety-six percent said the role of teachers should be expanded
in the area of educational decision-making. More than nine out of
10 favored school-based decision-making, which teachers say will
give them a greater voice in what happens in their classrooms.
   The poll found that 86 percent wanted public school teachers to
have more say in the allocation of funds, 78 percent wanted more
influence over curriculum, 56 percent believed they should
participate in the hiring of other teachers and 69 percent wanted
input into the selection of the building principal. In addition, 71
percent wanted to help choose books and instructional materials, 78
percent wanted a voice in setting teacher and administrative
salaries, and 54 percent wanted a say-so in tenure decisions.
   ``We also want policy makers to come into the classroom,'' said
Roberta E. Cocking of the Los Alamos Middle School in Los Alamos,
N.M., one of the teachers being recognized. She said few policy
makers know much about what goes on day-to-day in classrooms.
   Gallup in May polled 231 semifinalists in this year's ``Thanks
To Teachers'' program. The margin of error is plus or minus 6
percent. The program singles out teachers from across the nation
for recognition. It is sponsored by the foundation, the National
Alliance of Business, Apple Computer Inc. and Group W Television
Sales.
   Rhodes said, ``We believe the poll's findings are significant
because they represent the opinions of some of the best teachers in
the country _ educators whose communities view them as the best and
value what they do,'' said Rhodes.
   ``Their perception of the condition of education today is
reflective of that held by the public at large,'' she said.

   A small plane crashed and burned Monday
at the end of the runway at Fairbanks International Airport after
its engine stalled, killing both people aboard, a spokesman said.
   The two-seat Taylorcraft had taken off from the airport's gravel
strip and climbed about 600 feet when the engine stalled around
4:20 p.m., said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul
Steucke.
   The plane was destroyed by the fire, Steucke said.
   Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board were at the scene, but it was too soon to know the
cause of the crash, Steucke said.
   The victims' names were not released. The plane was privately
owned, Steucke said.

   A man held four
sheriffs and an interpreter hostage for more than six hours at a
courthouse Monday before an exchange of gunfire that left the
gunman and three police officers wounded, police said.
   None of the hostages were hurt and two of the wounded officers
suffered only superficial injuries in the incident in this
Vancouver suburb, said police Cpl. Casey deHaas.
   All four wounded were taken to a hospital. There was no
immediate word on the seriousness of the wounds suffered by the
gunman or the third officer.
   Police identified the hostage-taker as a 38-year-old man who had
gone to court to appeal a three-month sentence for violating crab
fishing regulations and a three-month sentence for obstructing
justice.
   The man had been free on bail but was taken into custody as a
condition of bail immediately before his court appearance Monday,
deHaas said.
   The man took the four provincial sheriffs and an interpreter
hostage around 10 a.m. PDT in the courthouse lockup.
   Police cordoned off the area in back of the courthouse, and a
police negotatior talked to the man over the phone. Members of New
Westminster's Emergency Response Team moved into place.
   At 4:20 p.m. PDT, more than a dozen shots were heard. Police
said the shots were confined to the lockup.
   Seconds after the shots, witnesses saw an Emergency Response
Team member emerge, clutching his side. The officer collapsed.
   Police believe the gunman brought a large-caliber handgun to the
courthouse. DeHaas said there were no metal detectors at the
courthouse Monday, although portable detectors are used for
high-security cases.

   In 1984, Ellen Altmann's boss at LaGuardia
Hospital told her she was spending too much time assisting a man
who had AIDS. The physicians were angry with her and worried she
was going to catch the disease by being in the same room with him
so often.
   So she did the only thing she felt she could do.
   ``When I handed in my resignation,'' Ellen said, ``I told them,
`I've decided to work exclusively with patients with AIDS.'''
   Her supervisor was astounded. ``What, are you crazy? Aren't you
afraid? You want to have a family someday. You're going to catch
something!''
   ``I'm not afraid,'' Ellen said. ``I'm just not ignorant.''
   Since the time before AIDS had a name, Ellen and Ed Altmann have
built their professional _ and sometimes, personal _ lives around
caring for people with the fatal, incurable disease. They are both
nurses, colleagues for seven years, spouses for five, taking on the
job it seemed at times no one else wanted.
   ``AIDS is especially nursing's disease,'' said Ellen, 32, now
the head nurse for the newly opened AIDS unit at Lenox Hill
Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side. ``I could work in a
doctor's office, I could work in a lab, I could work in surgery, I
could work in maternal-child health, where a lot of things are
mostly happy.
   ``But I think this is really the essence of nursing.''
   If AIDS is nursing's disease, as the Altmanns believe, it is
because medical technology has made so little headway against it.
Nursing care can make a difference, can help keep a person with the
full-blown disease out of the hospital.
   But few drugs have any impact on the inexorable ravages of the
virus.
   ``I think this is a particularly insane profession, very
strenuous, where you're always facing insurmountable odds,'' said
Ed, 36, who works in the nursing end of AIDS research running drug
trials for the Community Research Initiative.
   ``Working in a field like this, keeping that separation between
personal and professional, keeping some control over your life, it
really is a skill. A lot of people do burn out ... but to stay in
it, you really have to develop those boundaries for yourself.''
   There have been many times in their lives when the boundaries
between their personal and professional lives have disappeared,
lost in their passion for their cause.
   After Ellen resigned, she and Ed went to St. Clare's, a small,
aging Roman Catholic hospital tucked into Manhattan's tough Hell's
Kitchen neighborhood.
   There, in the city's first dedicated AIDS unit, they worked
14-hour days creating what would become a model for other hospitals.
   The two of them were the entire nursing staff, a pair with
distinctly different yet complementary styles. She's intense,
matter-of-fact, a doer who exudes confidence and competence; he's
more easy-going, a low-key observer who seems quietly self-assured.
   They also were newlyweds, spending 24 hours a day together,
supporting each other, fighting the tough fight and loving it.
   ``We spent more time together working than we ever have,'' Ellen
said. ``We were fighting for a cause together, something we were
both committed to.''
   ``It was a tremendous task and a thankless job,'' Ed said. ``But
by doing it, by putting ourselves in that situation, we got the
opportunity to learn how the system really works, how to start a
new program and make it fit into a hospital that's very resistant
to change.''
   At first, the doctors wouldn't come to their floor, the
housekeepers wouldn't come, the X-ray technicians wouldn't come.
The kitchen served patients' meals on paper trays. The fear was
palpable.
   Gradually, that changed. As the years passed, staffers who had
resented mandatory AIDS education classes that Ellen taught began
asking for them. What never changed was the relative youth of the
patients, many of them vital people at the height of their careers,
and the inevitability of their deterioration. ``We both ended up
getting involved with special patients who, for one reason or
another, became very close to us,'' Ellen said. ``We were able to
support each other through their deaths.''
   As patients have become their friends over the years, so some of
their friends have become patients.
   For months, the Altmanns took turns nursing a friend who
required daily care. They were the only ones he would allow
administer his twice-daily intravenous medication.
   Either Ed or Ellen would visit him in the morning before work,
and the other would come in the evening. They kept their home
stocked with IV supplies in case he was visiting their Queens
neighborhood.
   ``We never made any plans that didn't include seeing him or
communicating with him in some way,'' Ellen said. ``We restricted
our lives based on how he was feeling, because we always wanted to
be available.
   ``It was really stressful, and there were times we were angry.
We shouldn't have gotten so involved _ but how could we not?'' she
said, adding that their care helped the friend avoid two or three
hospitalizations. He died in January.
   ``I don't regret any of it,'' Ellen said. ``Even though at times
it seemed overwhelming for him to be so dependent on us, and us to
have all our social plans revolved around his care, I would not
have done it any differently.''
   Still, the days are gone when they would unhesitatingly dedicate
every spare minute to AIDS care with little thought to their
personal lives. Now, Ed spends two days a week at home with their
20-month-old son, Joshua, and Ellen makes it a point to work
regular hours and spend evenings and weekends with her family.
   But the nature of their work _ the intensity of the demands, the
inevitability of death _ means they always will need to look to
each other for special support.
   ``When you're talking to a friend who is not a nurse, and they
ask, `What do you do?' I can't possibly answer that,'' Ellen said.
``I can talk to you for weeks and weeks and weeks, and you still
wouldn't understand all the things I do as a nurse. And Ed
understands.''
   ``Sometimes,'' Ed said, ``just a couple of words, and I know
exactly what she's going through.''

   Young love blossomed two years ago at a hospital
detox center. Sara and Rafael were both 20, both shooting heroin
and cocaine, both looking for a way out. They found each other.
   ``When we started, he was determined to stop drugs,'' said Sara,
who didn't want her real name used. ``I would go get high, and I
would curse him out. He would say, `Come on. We can change
together.' ''
   The detox program didn't change them. But 18 months ago, they
joined the Addiction Research &amp; Treatment Corp.'s Heterosexual and
HIV transmission study. The five-year study involves counseling and
periodic follow-ups. Participants are tested for exposure to the
AIDS virus.
   Sara tested positive. Rafael did not. And that changed
everything.
   ``I felt cheated,'' she said, thinking of the moment when she
read the results. ``Here I am getting my life together, and this
... is happening to me?''
   ``She went crazy,'' said Rafael, who also did not want his name
used. ``She said she was going to get high again that day. She said
she was going to do drugs. I was watching her, because I was
nervous she was going to do something crazy, something stupid.''
   She cried, and he held her. ``I love you,'' he told her. ``It
doesn't matter.''
   But Sara's anger and confusion were overwhelming. For a month,
she washed her dishes in bleach for fear her nieces or nephews
would somehow catch the virus from her. She wouldn't let anyone
touch her. She couldn't believe Rafael wanted to stay with her.
   ``I tell him that if I had found out he had it, I would have
left him,'' Sara said.
   ``And I tell her, `Not everybody's the same. You got your
feelings, I've got mine,' '' Rafael replied. ``I know she got hurt,
knowing that she got it. I'm going to treat her bad, too? I didn't
treat her bad, and she wanted to go kill herself anyway. Imagine if
I had said, `I'm leaving you now.' Maybe she would have done it.''
   Sara knows when she was exposed. She shared a needle with her
older sister, who had said she carried the AIDS virus. Sara didn't
believe her. Now it is Rafael who has a hard time believing.
   ``He doesn't face it. He doesn't face it at all. To him, this is
like a flu that's going to get better,'' Sara said. ``He says, `I
know you're not going to die.' He doesn't face it at all. And we
talk about this every day, that he has to accept it, that I'm going
to get sick. And that he has to go on with his life.
   ``He says, `It's not true. Don't worry about it. You're going to
keep living.' I say, `Please listen to me. This is happening to
us.' He doesn't want to hear it.''
   About 20 percent of the 12,236 women with AIDS in the United
States are Hispanic, like Sara, even though Hispanics make up just
7 percent of the population. More than half of those women
contracted AIDS through needle-sharing, like Sara and her sister.
   ``If we had both had it, it would have been OK. But he didn't
have it, and I felt like I was depriving him of his life. I told
him that day, `Do your life. You can find somebody else,''' said
Sara, who grew up in the Bronx and now lives with Rafael in her
mother's house.
   This brown-eyed man with the soft voice and gentle ways is the
best thing in her life. The worst thing is the possibility that she
might infect him.
   ``I don't want to get him sick. That's my biggest fear. It would
be worse for me to know I got him sick than to know I'm sick
myself.''
   The risk of contracting AIDS is at least 15 times greater for
black and Hispanic heterosexuals than for white heterosexuals.
Heterosexual contact between intravenous drug users and their
partners is spreading the virus faster than any other transmission
mode, with the number of those cases up 27 percent from 1988 to
1989.
   Sara and Rafael know the risks. Rafael told their counselor,
Regina Phillips, that he was afraid he would hurt Sara's feelings
if he insisted on using condoms. Now it is Sara who insists, often
without success.
   ``He doesn't want to protect himself. I bought all kinds of
them, $7 for one of them. He won't use them,'' she said. ``It
wouldn't hurt me, if he uses them. It would hurt me more if he got
sick. That would kill me.''
   Sara has an associate degree in business administration, but she
can't work. She looks healthy behind her bright lipstick and
pink-framed glasses. But she has lost almost 20 pounds, and spends
many days trying to sleep off her weakness and fatigue.
   ``I don't have no future,'' she said, but later talked about the
simple wedding they plan for August and her desire to sharpen her
typing skills, get a job and become involved in religion.
   ``If I get it in my head that there's hope, that maybe I'll do
better, and it doesn't come ...,'' her voice trails off. ``I know
I'm going to get sick. It's going to happen eventually. So I take
one day at a time, one day at a time. Some days I feel strong. Some
days I don't.
   ``I live that day. And I thank God that night that I lived that
day.''

   Vladimir Zhironovsky, chairman of the Liberal
Democrats, conducts interviews on a park bench, not in an office.
His party couldn't afford an office even if one were available.
   ``We don't have any money, we don't have any press, we don't
have any advertising,'' he said on the bench in a quiet, shady
corner of Sokolniki Park in northeast Moscow.
   Nikolai Travkin, a plain-spoken former Communist Party member
who is forming a populist movement, incites disgruntled citizens to
throw out his former comrades. The Russian Social Democrats are
looking for coalition partners, and Communists need not apply.
   Dozens of parties have formed since the Communists and the
national legislature agreed in February to end the party's monopoly
on power. The political spectrum ranges from monarchist to
anarchist, but the Communist Party remains dominant.
   Communist reformer Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky said the newcomers
present a sideshow of ``proto-parties'' while a struggle for
control goes on in the 19-million member organization that has
ruled the Soviet Union since 1917.
   Travkin agrees what counts is not the number of parties, but
their ability to mount a nationwide challenge to the Communists.
   ``You can create as many parties as you want, but the Communist
Party will strangle them like chickens,'' he told supporters at a
rally.
   In pressing for an end to the constitutional monopoly of power,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Communists would ``struggle
for the status of the ruling party'' rather than having it
guaranteed.
   Whatever the theory, the party still controls newspapers, radio
and television.
   It has lost none of the vast staff and organizational experience
built up over 70 years, and party cells in factories, ministries,
the military and KGB secret police have not been eliminated.
   Opponents of the Communists have none of those advantages, but
also lack the party's big disadvantage: a legacy of repression and
mismanagement that is an easy target to attack.
   Oleg Rumyantsev said his Social Democrats ``are morally and
politically opposed to the ideology and practical ways of
revolutionary communism epitomized by the Bolsheviks.'' The party
will consider a coalition with anyone except the Communists, he
told the Interfax news service.
   Zhironovsky of the Liberal Democrats is a lawyer and proponent
of free markets who has spent years on the edge of the dissident
movement.
   He believes the Soviet Communists are going the way of Eastern
Europe's failed regimes.
   ``The question is how they are going to leave, and when,'' he
said.
   Many prominent people criticize the Communist Party, but forcing
it out will not be easy.
   No big names have joined the small opposition groups. Telephones
and apartments are so scarce there is no place for Zhironovsky to
put the Liberal Democrat headquarters, so he splits it between his
apartment and his office at a publishing house.
   He hopes that, in the interests of political stability, the
Communists will decide to hand over some of their plentiful office
space. Without a regular headquarters, he said, it is impossible
for his 9,000-member group to maintain regular contacts even with
legislators.
   Lawmakers ``have a mass of other problems, and they're going to
spend two or three days looking for me?'' he asked.
   The Communist reformer, Shostakovsky, said small parties do not
yet pose a serious challenge and the main contest is between
reformers and conservatives within the Communist Party.
   ``There are monarchists in the party, as strange as it seems,
and there are anarchists,'' said Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's
Higher Party School. He is a leader of Democratic Platform,
reformers who want the party leadership to abandon the idea of
leading and organizing the entire society.
   Other members include Boris N. Yeltsin, just elected president
of the Russian Federation; historian Yuri Afanasiev and Gavriil
Popov, mayor of Moscow.
   Some kind of party split is almost certain. A struggle now is
under way for control of the party center, and with it the majority
of members.
   Shostakovsky fears an attempt to seize control by party
hard-liners, who accused Gorbachev's economic advisers in documents
published May 13 of intending to dismantle Soviet socialism. They
condemned ``private enterprise, legalization of accumulating
capital, thirst for profit and individualism.''
   A national party Central Committee document criticized
Democratic Platform this spring for threatening to split the party
if it cannot force reform. The differences probably will come to a
head at the 28th party congress beginning July 2, and it is not
certain what direction Gorbachev will take.
   Shostakovsky said he did not expect Gorbachev to propose great
changes. If none occurred, he said, Democratic Platform would leave
and take 500,000 to 600,000 supporters along.
   It would be the largest opposition group by far, but still a
dwarf beside the mother party.
   Despite the prominence of many of its members, Democratic
Platform would face many of the difficulties confronted by other
opposition groups. Most of its supporters are intellectuals and
highly skilled workers, and Shostakovsky acknowledged it had
virtually no support in the countryside.
   Democratic Platform probably would cooperate with Gorbachev as
much as possible, playing the role of a loyal opposition rather
than trying to take power away from him.
   Travkin, whose populist message has found an audience with
radical workers, has been a member of Democratic Platform and still
has a ``partnership'' relationship with it, Shostakovsky said.
   He added, however, that Travkin was pressing too hard. ``There
is a taste of confrontation about it, extremely tough
confrontation,'' he said.
   As for Travkin, he said his populist Democratic Party of Russia
wants to replace local Communist leaders, not engage in ``endless
round tables'' to negotiate issues.
   Shostakovsky said opponents may be surprised by the Communists'
staying power.
   They have watched Soviet-inspired parties in Eastern Europe
quickly reduced to demoralized minority parties, he said, but
communism was imposed there and was homegrown in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Unusual Lineup in Arkansas Tops Primary Balloting</HEAD>

   A white supremacist faces a black businessman in an Arkansas
runoff today for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor. In
South Carolina, two state senators compete for a chance to run
against Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   In other voting:
   _Atlantic City, N.J., Mayor James L. Usry, under indictment on
corruption charges, tries to hold onto his job in a non-partisan
runoff with City Councilman Jim Whelan.
   _North Dakota voters decide whether to raise the sales tax from
5 percent to 6 percent for a year to bail out education.
   _Maine has primaries in both parties to pick nominees for the
congressional seat held by Democrat Joseph E. Brennan. He is giving
up the seat to try to regain his job as governor.
   The Arkansas runoff was required when Ralph Forbes, 50-year-old
evangelist for the Sword of the Lord Good News Ministries, polled
46 percent of the vote in the May 29 primary, short of the majority
needed to win the nomination. The second-place finisher, with 36
percent, was Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, who previously lost bids
for seats in the General Assembly and the Little Rock Board of
Directors.
   ``In listening to folks who I know are Republicans and talking
to them, they are not very enamored with either candidate,'' said
Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political consultant. ``They wished a
stronger candidate had stepped forward. Now it's a matter of the
best of the weak.''
   Forbes believes that whites and blacks would be better off under
separate governments. In an interview Sunday with the Arkansas
Democrat, he proclaimed that ``white Christian Americans are the
true lost tribe of Israel'' and said that the sight of an
interracial couple ``turns my stomach.''
   Virtually every prominent Republican in the state has endorsed
Harris, 36, an executive with a company that manufactures hair care
products for blacks.
   Sheffield Nelson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee, ran TV
advertisements this week denouncing Forbes.
   The winner of the runoff will face Jim Guy Tucker, a former
congressman who won a seven-way Democratic primary.
   The lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate and takes
over the governor's duties when the governor is out of state. That
makes it a low-profile job ordinarily, but Gov. Bill Clinton
travels a great deal and may be traveling more if he runs for
president, as many expect.
   In South Carolina, state Sens. Theo Mitchell and Ernest
Passailaigue waged populist campaigns for the chance to face
Campbell, who is only the second Republican governor in the state
this century and is highly popular.
   Passailaigue, a 42-year-old accountant from Charleston, won his
first bid for office in 1988. He has been a frequent challenger of
Senate leadership despite his freshman status, pushing
unsuccessfully for tax reform.
   Mitchell, a 51-year-old Greenville lawyer and state lawmaker
since 1974, has represented a racially mixed district for the past
six years. He has been a proponent of public transportation and
assistance to the poor.
   If victorious in November, Mitchell would become the state's
first black governor.
   In Maine, the Democratic front-runner in a five-way
congressional race is Attorney General James E. Tierney. Two
Republicans are in the race: David F. Emery, who held the seat for
eight years until 1982, and state Rep. John McCormick. McCormick
opposes abortion rights. Emery has changed his position and is now
pro-choice.
   Three GOP senators faced no primary opposition today in their
bids for re-election.
   Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia won't even face a major party
opponent in November. The state Democratic Central Committee,
meeting Saturday, decided not to oppose him.
   Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine will face Democratic state Rep.
Neil Rolde in November, and Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina
will be challenged in November by Democrat Robert Cunningham.

<HEAD>Indians Control Valuable Commodity _ Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ANGELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT WASHAKIE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the arid West, where water is more
valuable than gold, the Wind River Indian Reservation considers
itself awash in wealth.
   The Indians last year won rights to much of the water in
west-central Wyoming. Now their destiny is no longer entirely in
the hands of the white man, who relegated them to the 2.5
million-acre reservation in the mid-1800s.
   ``Look how many years we've taken the back seat to everything,''
says Burton Hutchinson, Northern Arapaho tribal chairman. ``We're
the ones in the driver's seat now. It feels good. Real good. Real
nice.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that an 1868 treaty gave
the Northern Arapahos and Shoshones priority rights to 500,000
acre-feet of water from the Wind River _ roughly twice what the
6,000 Indians previously controlled. An acre-foot is enough to
cover an acre to a depth of one foot.
   Among other things, the Indians hope to attract tourists and
anglers to the river by maintaining the flow rather than diverting
water to irrigation in dry times.
   ``I want to see the day when every tribal member who wants to
work can,'' said Wes Martel, co-chairman of the Shoshone Business
Council.
   ``I want to see the day when everyone on the reservation who
wants an education can get one, when the elders can get the medical
care they need and when the reservation stands out as an example of
what can be done when people can plan for the future,'' he added.
``And this water is the key to all of that.''
   However, the Indians' newfound wealth has brought them into
conflict with non-Indian farmers on the reservation.
   In the past Indians and non-Indians shared water in dry times.
But after the Supreme Court ruling, the tribes began making sure
their water rights were observed before sending water to the
non-Indian farmers, some of whose ancestors homesteaded the area
with federal assurances they would have water.
   In early May, when runoff was scarce, the tribes shut off water
to about 30 non-Indians in a section that relies on canals for
water from the Wind.
   ``It's pretty frustrating to watch your sprinkler sit there idle
while your neighbor sits there and uses 12,000 gallons of water to
irrigate land covered mostly with foxtails,'' said Fran Fox, a
non-Indian farmer.
   ``Each day you watch water go down the river that should be in
your canal,'' said another farmer, Tim Shell. ``Before this
started, we shared water by rotation and we all survived. The rules
have changed now. Some are prospering and some will be a lot worse
off.''
   To alleviate disputes last year, the state paid the tribes $5.3
million to secure water for the non-Indian irrigators.
   But efforts to reach another agreement for this year broke down
in February, with the state saying the price the Indians were
asking was too high.
   Reservation hydrologist Catherine Vandemoer said the Indians are
not obligated to give the non-Indians any water at all. And she
said that as runoff increases this spring, enough water should be
available for everyone.
   ``They will be fine the rest of the summer,'' she said. ``These
people really have nothing to worry about.''
   But the non-Indian farmers complain that the lack of water has
already cost them barley and hay.
   ``We are talking about 65 to 70 bushels (of barley per acre) as
opposed to 100,'' Fox said. ``My hay will be less than half of a
crop.''
   Non-Indians on the reservation ``have no representation; we are
disenfranchised,'' Fox said. ``We are feeling a little lonely.''
   Martel said the Indians are trying to manage the water in a way
that will improve the reservation's economy.
   ``We've got to do something to alleviate the 70 percent
unemployment and provide health care for our people who are not
getting it,'' said Martel.
   ``If we didn't have such potential, things here would be a
little depressing. We are just trying to protect what little we
have left.''

<HEAD>Killer Wasps Can Reduce Pesticide Hazards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers soon may have an environmentally safe
alternative to pesticides _ swarms of tiny wasps trained for
search-and-destroy missions against two of the nation's most
destructive crop pests.
   Researchers at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory in
Tifton are experimenting with odors and colors to enhance the
wasp's natural bloodhound ability to locate corn ear and tobacco
bud worms.
   The two caterpillars attack at least 100 plants, including corn,
cotton, soybeans and tomatoes. They are members of the Heliothis
pest family, blamed for more than $1 billion in crop losses each
year.
   Joe Lewis, an entomologist with the USDA's Agricultural Research
Service, and visiting Dutch student Felix Wackers are raising small
wasps known as Microplitis croceipes. They are natural enemies of
Heliothis insects but do not harm humans.
   The Heliothis pests often try to evade the enemies by hiding in
crevices of plants and leaving decoy sites with their scents.
   ``The wasps are like detectives,'' Lewis said. ``They're
monitoring, eavesdropping. By understanding how they identify clues
that signal the caterpillar's presence, we can turn them into an
asset.''
   The female wasp deposits an egg inside the caterpillar while
stinging. The egg hatches into a larva, feeds inside the host and
eventually kills the caterpillar. The larva then leaves and spins a
cocoon in which it develops into a wasp.
   As the wasps emerge from the cocoon, the caterpillar odor left
on the cocoon is sensed by the wasp and used later to locate hosts
for its eggs, Lewis said.
   To use wasps to kill pests, large numbers will have to be raised
in laboratories. But ``if you released them in a cornfield and they
didn't have any training for worms, they might fly off to another
field,'' said Wackers.
   So the researchers are using Pavlovian techniques to make the
wasps more efficient killers. They have conditioned wasps to
recognize the odor of caterpillar feces and pick out cues such as
the color and shape of a cotton bloom.
   Wasps that received caterpillars as rewards were 90 percent
effective in choosing the correct odors and colored cards in flight
chamber tests. Similar results were achieved when wasps were
released in small plots.
   ``We can program them to seek a certain kind of plant and a
certain part of the plant in searching for pests,'' said Lewis.
   Wasps are already used for pest control in greenhouses in Europe
and the United States. It has always been assumed that insect
behavior was determined by instinct, but Lewis said his tests have
shown the wasps can be trained.
   In one experiment, he taught them to associate the smell of
vanilla with caterpillars.
   ``Our ability to train them to respond to such novel and
otherwise unattractive odors demonstrates the remarkable capacity
of these wasps to learn,'' Lewis said.
   The researchers estimate that by 1995, parasitic wasps could be
sent out to patrol full-sized fields.

   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm knows the rewards of
having the National Rifle Association as an ally. Michael Dukakis,
on the other hand, knows what it's like to lead the NRA's list of
enemies.
   The organization uses its cash-rich political action committee
to support its political allies and in the past has dug deep into
its coffers to attack candidates it views as opponents.
   The current Senate debate over a major crime bill that includes
bans on nine categories of semiautomatic weapons is the latest test
of the NRA's clout.
   The association won a round last Thursday when it got enough
votes to stall action on the bill. But it likely will be tested
again in the coming weeks, as even Republican lawmakers considered
staunch NRA allies seek a compromise so the Congress can pass an
election-year crime bill.
   History says the NRA will remember the votes come fall. And its
PAC has the money to affect campaigns, holding more than $631,000
at the end of May, according to Federal Election Commission records.
   The PAC raised $1.2 million in the 15 months ending in March _
the 24th best showing among more than 4,500 registered committees _
and already had donated $320,000 to congressional candidates in the
1990 cycle.
   Like many wealthy PACs, it not only gives directly to candidates
but also uses media ads and mail appeals to influence targeted
campaigns.
   Gramm, a conservative Republican who is a natural NRA ally,
received $9,900 directly from the PAC for his 1984 election
campaign. It also spent $327,850 on an independent drive to support
his candidacy.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee, was on the other end of an NRA
independent-expenditure campaign.
   FEC records show the NRA spent more than $1.5 million against
Dukakis, much of that on radio ads and direct mail appeals that
accused Dukakis of vowing to disarm his state.
   Dukakis said the ads distorted his views and at one point he
threatened to sue the NRA. Still, his campaign was forced to
counter with ads of its own _ diverting valuable campaign money and
air time.
   FEC records show most of the 37 senators whose vote helped the
NRA's position in the Senate last Thursday have received campaign
help from the organization.
   Over the past six years, the NRA has spent nearly $700,000 on
behalf of 33 of the 37 senators, according to FEC records. The
six-year period was chosen because 1984 was the last time some
senators were up for re-election.
   More than $240,000 of the spending by the NRA's political
committee was in the form of campaign donations to the 33. The
NRA's PAC spent an additional $440,000 on advertising and other
independent efforts to support of five of the 33, including the
nearly $330,000 spent to support Gramm.
   The Thursday vote came on a motion to limit the length of debate
on the crime bill, with the Senate leadership falling three short
of the 60 votes it needed.
   Supporting the leadership in that unsuccessful effort were 21
senators who in the past six years have received financial help
from the NRA.
   The records show that NRA spent more than $240,000 on behalf of
the 21; $112,600 in direct contributions and $130,450 on
independent efforts to support four of the 21.
   Ten of the 21 lawmakers sided with the NRA two weeks ago when an
amendment that would have removed the gun controls from the
legislation failed on a 52-48 vote. But last week the 10 sided with
the leadership in trying to limit debate.
   Among them was Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who according to FEC
records benefited from a $112,000 NRA independent expenditure
campaign in 1986.
   Specter is coauthor of a provision in the bill designed to speed
up certain executions, and his vote Thursday was interpreted more
as an effort to keep the overall crime bill alive than as a rebuke
to the NRA.
   Also among the 10 lawmakers who supported the NRA stance earlier
but sided with the leadership last week was Sen. Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who
has received $15,000 from the NRA over the past six years.
   If the bill clears the Senate with the bans on semiautomatic
weapons, the NRA's lobbying effort will shift to the House, where
it also has dozens of staunch allies. The NRA's PAC has donated
more than $2 million to House candidates in the past six years.
   But its chances of deleting the bans from the legislation in the
House are not considered as strong as in the Senate. Democrats,
generally supportive of the bans, hold a bigger majority in the
House and the rules of that chamber forbid filibusters.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Pay Raise Yet to Emerge as Issue With Clout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If voters are truly outraged about the big pay
raise the House gave itself, they're not registering it at the only
place that really counts _ the ballot box.
   The bulk of the primary election season was completed as of last
Tuesday, and the results show that not one incumbent was defeated
because of a vote for the raise, which will boost House salaries to
about $125,000 in January 1991 from the current $96,600.
   Only one incumbent lost for any reason, and that was Rep. Donald
E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, whose party abandoned him after he was
convicted of sexual improprieties with a minor.
   It's not that challengers didn't try to use the pay issue. In
fact, a handful of veteran Democrats had close calls where the pay
issue was used against them, most notably Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania.
   The chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the
nation's military spending _ and a pay-raise booster _ Murtha
received barely more than 50 percent of the vote in defeating a
little-known and thinly financed opponent.
   For a few days last month after Murtha's scare, the Capitol was
abuzz. Was the pay issue bigger than they thought? If someone as
powerful as Murtha be brought to his knees, was any not vulnerable?
   But now that talk has settled down.
   Political analysts found other, local reasons at the root of
Murtha's troubles. And some other Democrats who expected primary
trouble have came through with bigger-than-expected margins despite
their pay-raise votes.
   ``Any member of Congress who is doing a good job, responsive to
his or her district and is well loved by the district will not be
defeated by his or her vote on the pay raise,'' said Howard
Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
   ``They all won, and that's the bottom line,'' said Rep. Vic
Fazio, D-Calif., who spearheaded the drive last year for the pay
raise and ethics-reform legislation. ``I really believe the issue
is behind us.''
   That high level of confidence is due, in part, to something
known on Capitol Hill but not widely known elsewhere. Before
passing the pay raise last year, the two parties agreed not to use
it against each others' candidates.
   For the intra-party warfare of the primary elections, that pact
didn't apply, but it will in November. So, the feeling is that
House incumbents have already withstood the toughest shots.
   Fazio says the heat is now on the Senate, which rejected the big
25 percent increase the House gets next year and decided instead to
let its members keep taking fees of up to $2,000 a speech from
special-interest groups. Several senators have promised to try
again this year to ban such honoraria.
   Fazio cites California voters' strong 62 percent approval last
week of Proposition 112, which would prohibit state lawmakers from
accepting money for speeches and set up a commission to set pay
increases.
   The House voted to ban speech honoraria beginning next year, as
part of the pay deal. And there are other similarities with
California _ for example, the strong opposition to both plans by
consumer activist Ralph Nader.
   Nader and others remain confident the issue will heat up again
for the fall election. Several top political analysts have wondered
aloud if the pay raise won't feed into a general mood of discontent
among the voters.
   History is a poor guide on this one.
   Congressional Quarterly researched the issue recently and found
that voters did indeed toss members out in droves when they passed
big pay increases in 1816 and 1873.
   But in 1855 and a century later, in 1955, pay increases of 50
percent and 80 percent were passed without resulting in any great
electoral turmoil.
   The feeling in the Capitol, based on the primary results, is
that 1990 is looking a lot like 1955.

<HEAD>Activists See Iowa as `Test Tube' for Abortion Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists on both sides of the abortion
issue see Iowa's gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races as a ``test
tube'' in which to develop campaign strategies that can be put to
work elsewhere.
   The dividing lines sharpened last week when Democrats nominated
pro-choice House Speaker Don Avenson to run against first-term
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who opposes abortion.
   The state's Senate race also matches up candidates on opposing
sides of the abortion issue. Anti-abortion Republican Rep. Tom
Tauke is hoping to oust Sen. Tom Harkin, who is pro-choice on
abortion.
   ``Iowa is one of the most important states in terms of
gubernatorial races and Senate races,'' said Loretta Ucelli of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, or NARAL. ``The stakes are
very high there.''
   Mona Smit of the Iowa Right to Life Committee said the November
elections ``now become a high priority as Iowans now have a clear
choice.''
   Activists on both sides of the abortion issue say they will wage
high-profile campaigns in Iowa, which holds the nation's first test
of presidential strength. Political tactics often get a trial run
in Iowa before being put into play elsewhere.
   ``Iowa is sort of a test tube for campaign strategy and
techniques,'' said Joe Shanahan, a spokesman for the Iowa
Democratic Party. ``We have pretty much a fulltime campaign going
on.''
   Both Democratic candidates, Harkin and Avenson, say they will
make their pro-choice positions an important part of the fall
campaigns.
   ``I don't think we can beat Terry Branstad unless we offer
voters a contrast,'' Avenson said of the governor's race.
   ``All eyes are going to be on Iowa this year,'' Harkin said.
``This is the one Senate race where there is a clear-cut
difference.''
   Last week's primary was the first election in the state since
the U.S. Supreme Court last year gave states more freedom to
restrict abortion.
   Pro-choice activists said Avenson's primary election victory
over anti-abortion Attorney General Tom Miller demonstrated the
political clout of the abortion issue. Miller began the race as the
prohibitive favorite after a dozen years in office but plummeted in
the polls as he was hammered on abortion.
   ``If NARAL hadn't been out there, we would have had Tom Miller
as the candidate,'' said Shelley Bain of the Iowa NARAL affiliate.
   Branstad and Tauke discounted the role of abortion in the
outcome.
   ``Tom Miller waffled all over the court,'' Branstad said. ``You
won't find me doing that.''
   Tauke said voters in Iowa are sophisticated and unlikely to cast
their ballots on a single issue.
   ``Essentially, the Miller campaign didn't give people a reason
to vote for him,'' he said.
   Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, who is not up for re-election
this year, said only hard-core activists are moved by the abortion
issue.
   ``Those are really far-out people and they represent about 10
percent to 15 percent of the electorate,'' he said.
   But pro-choice advocates point to other signs the state's
electorate is on their side. They say polls find more than 60
percent of those surveyed identify with the pro-choice label. They
also point to the victory of pro-choice Democrat Eric Tabor in a
congressional primary in Tauke's district.
   In addition, a series of attempts to enact restrictions in the
legislature failed by 2-1 margins last winter, a good barometer of
public opinion, they say.
   Republicans reject the suggestion abortion will cause them
problem this fall.
   ``If abortion hurts Tom Tauke or Terry Branstad, it will be
because they fail to talk about other issues in a way that moves
people,'' said Iowa Republican Party spokesman Mike Day.

<HEAD>Irvine's Liberal Era Ends as Activist Mayor is Ousted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This affluent Republican city in
conservative Orange County has ended a strange political marriage,
ousting a Democratic mayor schooled in '60s activism who put the
environment, gay rights and foreign affairs on the municipal agenda.
   The days of blaring national headlines like ``Irvine and the
Ozone: City Sets Out to Save the Planet'' are over. But Larry Agran
has left his mark on the community.
   Agran, 45, a 12-year City Councilman who two years ago became
the first directly elected mayor of the city of 110,000, lost to
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan by 860 votes Tuesday. Previously
the mayor was appointed by the council.
   ``We've been on a very ambitious progressive course,'' Agran
said Thursday. ``I think that has political costs associated with
it.''
   The voters also rejected two of Agran's council allies,
restoring a conservative majority.
   ``He'd lost touch with our community. They felt it was time for
a change, to get back to the realities of running city
government,'' said Sheridan, 55, a real estate agent elected to the
council in 1984. ``They didn't like the city of Irvine being used
for an international political agenda.''
   ``If the city's name does not get into the paper for the next
year, I will not be unhappy,'' she said.
   Agran, a lawyer educated at Harvard and the University of
California at Berkeley during the 1960s, managed to hold power in a
Southern California county and city where Republicans outnumber
Democrats 2-1. Only three of the county's 29 mayors are registered
Democrats.
   He initially succeeded because his blend of fiscal conservatism
and social liberalism appealed to traditional conservatives, said
Mark Petracca, an Agran supporter and political science professor
at the University of California at Irvine.
   ``That conservative constituency supported his intention to use
government to do social good,'' Petracca said.
   Agran's approach to social change was broad, even global, in
scope as he tried to set an example for municipal activism.
   He successfully fought for environmental measures ranging from
curbside recycling and open-space preservation to stringent
restrictions on the use of chloroflurocarbons and other industrial
chemicals that damage the ozone.
   He pursued an ambitious mass-transit plan focusing on a
countywide monorail system. The $250 million proposal also provided
a model for shifting the defense industry toward civilian projects
as military spending decreases, Agran said.
   Under Agran, the city aggressively pursued business and cultural
ties with foreign countries, particularly those in the Pacific Rim.
   And the mayor made a postwar trip to Vietnam to try to reunite
five Irvine-area Vietnamese families with relatives lost after the
fall of Saigon.
   Some in Irvine, including Sheridan, accused Agran of ignoring
``pothole projects'' in favor of ``esoteric'' international issues.
   Agran denied that and said he was advancing issues that
concerned residents on both a personal and political level.
   A human rights ordinance enacted under Agran stirred opposition.
   Christian fundamentalists and others opposed the ordinance
because it barred discrimination against homosexuals, among other
groups. Voters in November removed the protection for gay people,
despite Agran's call for tolerance.
   Petracca suggested that such political controversy simply
doesn't fit the nature of the community, which the 1980 Census
showed to have a median income 37 percent above the county's
$22,802.
   ``Most of the people want to be left alone to their little house
and plot of grass. That's why they moved to Irvine,'' Petracca
said. ``You want political action, you move to Chicago.''
   Agran also said he believes a $25,000, last-minute mailer, sent
out by a county GOP organization, tipped the balance. The mailer
included a reprint of an article that labeled him the ``Evil
Emperor of Irvine.''
   Sheridan said some of Agran's programs were valuable and
probably would remain.
   Agran said another run for office is unlikely in the short term,
but he had no regrets about his activist tenure.
   ``I think in many respects we have changed the political
landscape,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Disputes Over Price Supports to Get Public Airing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is going
public this week with its disputes over price supports in the 1990
farm bill.
   Meanwhile, the counterpart panel in the House is wrapping up its
version of the legislation that sets agriculture policy for the
next five years with completion of the conservation section of the
bill.
   Both debates are scheduled for Tuesday. The House plan is to
have a bill on the floor by June 25. The Senate is not as
optimistic.
   The big stumbling block in the Senate is over commodities. Most
problems with other sections were resolved in closed meetings
between the Democratic and Republican staffs and quickly approved
in open sessions of the committee.
   When the staffs couldn't resolve the commodity price support
problems, committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., appointed a
working group of himself and Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; David Pryor,
D-Ark.; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Bob Dole, R-Kan.; and Thad Cochran,
R-Miss.
   When that group couldn't solve the problems, Leahy decided to
settle the matter through voting in open session.
   ``I think we will end up getting a bill reported out,'' Kerrey
said last Friday. ``It won't be what Lugar wants. It won't be
exactly what I want.''
   Kerrey took the lead among the Democrats in the committee who
proposed increasing price supports by 1 percent in 1991 and
allowing other increases in the four subsequent years based on
inflation rates.
   Lugar's proposal represented the Bush administration's position
that price supports should be frozen at 1990 levels. The House bill
also calls for a freeze.
   Kerrey said his proposal would cost $13 billion in 1991, even
though ``we only got $10.6 billion from the Budget Committee.''
   He said Leahy had told him he wouldn't take a bill to the full
committee unless it had support of all the Democrats on the panel,
was within the budget and could bring in some of the Republicans.
   ``I think we have every disagreement settled except for the loan
rates,'' Kerrey said.
   Lugar told reporters early last week that he would not accept
anything other than a freeze in target prices and loan rates. He
said if Democrats wanted to make an issue of it, they would find
themselves in a floor battle that could lead to a one-year
extension of current law instead of a five-year program.
   ``The administration wants a one-year extension,'' Kerrey said.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has said repeatedly that
an extension would be acceptable because international trade talks
to be completed in December, could create a need for a change in
support policies anyway.

   Animal rights activists would end up in
federal prison if they attack farms or research labs, under
legislation up for a vote this week in the House Agriculture
Committee.
   ``It brings the full weight of our laws against the extremists
who have gotten out of control,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm,
D-Texas, sponsor of the measure, which is similar to a bill
approved by the Senate last November.
   He said it applies only to crimes considered ``terrorist''
attacks. He wants it included in the 1990 farm bill.
   The measure applies to facilities or premises where an animal is
kept for food, fiber production, agriculture, research, testing or
education.
   It makes it a federal crime to:
   _Disrupt the activities of the premises.
   _Steal or damage property or animals.
   _Enter a facility with the intent to commit a violation.
   _Remain in a facility despite notice that entry was forbidden.
   Violators could be fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to
three years, or both.
   Any person harmed by a violation may recover actual and
consequential damages and court costs.
   ``No matter how good and righteous you think your cause is, you
do not have the right to take the law into your own hands,'' said
Stenholm. ``Those who choose to disrupt lawful agricultural and
scientific research activities through violent means should face
legal sanctions that are commensurate with their actions.''
   Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., another member of the House
Agriculture Committee, has proposed an amendment to the Animal
Welfare Act that would set fines but no jail time for damage to
research facilities or farms.
   It also includes a provision that allows for temporary removal
of an animal from a research facility to document whether the
animal is being treated properly according to existing law.
   If a person who has broken into a facility proves that animals
are being mistreated, the facility would have to reimburse the
person who committed the break-in for any court costs.
   Rose's bill also allows people to file lawsuits on behalf of
animals.

<HEAD>Barry Case Revives Charge of `Selective Prosecution'</HEAD>

   Almost as though it were an obvious fact, some
blacks questioned as Marion Barry's potential jurors have been
telling a judge they believe the Washington mayor would not be on
trial if he were white.
   Barry's arrest in an elaborate FBI sting operation revived a
charge that prosecutors systematically go after successful black
politicians.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, estimates that
80 percent of the black people in Washington believe that to be
true. He puts himself in that category, too.
   Mary R. Sawyer, assistant professor of religious studies at Iowa
State University, has studied the issue. In a 1987 report, she
listed 77 black public officials who she says were subject to
selective prosecution or some other form of harassment.
   Among those she lists: Mayors Maynard Jackson of Atlanta,
Coleman Young of Detroit and Richard Arrington of Birmingham, Ala.;
former Mayors Carl Stokes of Cleveland, Kenneth Gibson of Newark,
N.J.; and Charles Evers of Fayette, Miss.; Reps. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.; Harold Ford, D-Tenn.; and Louis Stokes, D-Ohio; and former
Reps. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y. and Charles Diggs, D-Mich.
   But as often as the accusation is made, prosecutors deny it.
   ``We follow the evidence wherever it leads, regardless of
position, race, party affiliation or other identifying factors,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said last January.
   Last month, he said ``no one would be more disturbed than I
would be'' if it were proven that the Justice Department engaged in
racially motivated selective prosecutions.
   In court, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens suggested that the
government went after Barry because he is a role model in a city
that last year saw 438 homicides, most of them drug-related.
   Barry's arrest is ``a personal tragedy'' Stephens said, but
``narcotics abuse is also a tragedy for this city ... not a
victimless crime.''
   Obliquely, Barry himself makes the charge, too.
   ``The prosecutors have been dipping and dabbling in the politics
of Washington for a long time,'' he said in May, and complained he
had been ``hounded, harassed, vilified, slandered.''
   The view that Barry had been singled out was expressed by some
potential jurors as the mayor's trial on drug and perjury charges
started last week.
   ``It seems like that some people are made to go through a little
more than others,'' one potential juror told U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson. ``They televised this too much, talked
about it too much. ... I think race had a lot to do with it, as far
as giving him a hard time.''
   Jackson asked if a white mayor would have been spared
investigation and prosecution under similar circumstances.
   ``Exactly,'' she replied.
   She was accepted as a member of the jury pool.
   ``The media can say Barry's lifestyle is not appropriate, but
the masses of people perceive that if Marion Barry were white we
would not be reading anything about him,'' says Clarence Mitchell
III, who served with Barry in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee in the 1960s.
   Mitchell says he also is a victim of selective prosecution. A
former Maryland state legislator, he says he was investigated 19
times in 24 years in public life before being tried with his
brother, Michael, and convicted on charges of accepting a bribe. He
is appealing.
   At the sentencing, their mother, Juanita Jackson Mitchell,
alluded to the brothers' claim that they were victims of an FBI
vendetta.
   ``My sons are casualties on the road to freedom,'' she said.
   The NAACP's Hooks, in an interview, was careful to avoid passing
judgment on Barry. But he drew an analogy: ``If everyone is going
80 miles an hour on the highway, and you're doing 70 and the cops
stop you, you've got to wonder.''
   Joseph Agne, a consultant to the National Council of Churches,
suggests that white prosecutors go after blacks as ``one way to get
around the gains from the Voting Rights Act.'' Its enactment led to
the election of thousands of black public officials.
   Last year the church group, in a resolution, deplored what it
saw as a ``concerted effort on the part of law enforcement
officials to discredit and remove African American elected
officials from office.''
   But Richard A. Samp, chief counsel for the conservative
Washington Legal Foundation, says an increase in investigations of
black officeholders was inevitable. Corruption generally occurs at
the local level, Samp says, and that's where blacks generally have
been winning elections.
   And Louis Michael Seidman, law professor at Georgetown
University, points to a 19th century Supreme Court decision that
selective prosecution _ to make an example of a conspicuous
lawbreaker, for example _ is permissible, as long as it is not
based on such things as race or religion.
   Barry's only recourse, now that he has admitted he used crack
cocaine at a hotel last Jan. 18, is to persuade a jury that he was
singled out, Seidman says.
   ``In reality, that is his defense,'' says Seidman. ``The
question he wants the jury to think about is whether the government
was conducting a vendetta against him because he was black.''

<HEAD>Washington Proves a Bad Example in Head Count</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The directors of the 1990 U.S. Census can, on
a clear day, see one of their biggest nightmares from their office
windows.
   Residents of the nation's capital are down near the bottom of
the list when it comes to doing their census duty. They're behind
every state and are 29th out of the country's 32 biggest cities in
cooperating with the head count.
   It looks like the national drive to convince people it's their
civic duty to fill those census forms out went straight past the
federal government's back yard.
   ``This is a world capital city,'' John Connelly, an assistant to
the director of the census, said last week. ``There are people from
all over the world here. You have a lot of immigrants, a lot of
Hispanics in the greater Washington area.''
   Language differences and distrust of the federal government are
among the major barriers census officials have cited in getting
people to do the decennial task.
   ``Most of our major cities were low,'' said Russell Davis, a
spokesman in the Census Bureau's promotion office.
   But hardly any so low as the District of Columbia, which also
boasts the nation's highest concentration of government workers.
   As of June 5, the Census Bureau reported a 76 percent response
rate from the district. And that followed door-to-door questioning
by census counters after only 57 percent of the city's households
mailed their forms in.
   The bureau reported a national 91 percent response rate as of
last week.
   Every state was above 80 percent and Iowans were the closest to
putting the counting behind them with a 97.8 percent response.
   ``I wouldn't say the district is especially disappointing,''
said Connelly. ``But, sure, there are probably comments going
around that a lot of people here work for the federal government
and ought to know what the census is for.''
   Kay Hixson, a spokeswoman for Mayor Marion Barry, said the city
has spent some $400,000 this spring on the census.
   ``We're obviously disappointed the response is not what we had
hoped,'' she said. But she said Washington's unique population
makeup may actually be hurting the census effort.
   ``We have a substantial transient population, with congressional
people, embassies, international banks. These are things where
people move in and out and I would suspect that often they're not
focused on things critical to the community,'' said Hixson.
   Other cities are having problems, however.
   Boston was the worst of the big cities with a 71.7 percent
response rate as of a week ago. Phoenix, Ariz., was next at 73.4
percent and New York City was at 74.1 percent.
   In contrast, Detroit reported a 93.4 percent response rate. San
Antonio, which has a large Hispanic population, was also at 93.4
percent.

<TEXT>
   The 128-year-old wreckage of the Civil War
ironclad Monitor is fragile but still intact, the government said
as it cleared the way for photographers to venture to the ship's
Atlantic grave.
   For the first time in 11 years, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration is permitting research dives to the
ship, which sank in a gale 16 miles off Cape Hatteras, N.C., in
1862.
   Armed with a NOAA permit, photographer and author Rod Farb of
Cedar Grove, N.C., arrived at the site with a film crew last week,
beating out a scuba-diving rival.
   Farb and Gary Gentile of Philadelphia had vied to become the
first to dive to the ship since French explorer Jacques Cousteau
did it in 1979.
   Gentile still plans to dive to the ship in several weeks, but it
won't be the same, said his attorney, Peter Hess.
   ``Do you remember the second guy to cross the Atlantic?'' he
said.
   Gentile had filed 11 permit applications and written more than
50 letters to NOAA since 1984 seeking permission to photograph the
wreck. He won his Monitor permit first but decided to wait until
the weather improved at the end of June to make the trip, Hess said,
   Cousteau's expedition was hampered by bad weather and poor
visibility, and little or no usable footage was produced.
   But NOAA said Farb was blessed with good conditions when he and
his crew made their first dive at the end of last week. NOAA, part
of the Commerce Department, is responsible for safeguarding the
wreckage.
   Accompanied by a NOAA representative, Farb was expected to
remain at the site for several days, and the agency said it did not
expect him to release any footage right away.
   NOAA refused to allow Monitor dives after Cousteau's trip,
saying the 220-foot depth posed ``a serious and unreasonable risk''
that its own divers would not take.
   Meanwhile, some private divers _ fearing the wreck was in danger
of collapse _ lobbied the agency to permit dives before the
historic ship was lost.
   NOAA reversed its position after one of its administrative law
judges ruled last November that the agency exaggerated safety
concerns, and that ``a significant number of trained scuba divers''
frequently descend 220 feet.
   Before permitting Farb's dive, NOAA researchers disclosed Friday
that they descended to the wreck in a submarine on June 1-2 to make
a ``visual record'' to ensure that artifacts are not tampered with
later.
   ``The best word to describe the condition is that we believe
it's stable,'' said Tim Keeney, NOAA director of ocean and coastal
resources. ``Certainly the hull of the vessel is not made of thick
metal and there are parts that have caved in. However, there is
armor plating surrounding the vessel, and that is almost totally
intact on the port side.''
   The ship's gun turret ``looks like it's in pretty good shape,''
Keeney said.
   The Monitor sank after a celebrated battle with the Confederate
ship Merrimack in 1862. It was discovered by researchers in 1973.
The Merrimack, renamed the Virginia, was destroyed by its crew to
keep it from being captured by the Union.
   The Monitor appears fragile, said Irv Garrison, a NOAA marine
archaeologist who was on the submarine.
   ``Time is one thing,'' he said. ``But she's also right in the
area of a shipping lane, and every destroyer that went by may have
dropped a load on her. She might have been depth-charged, which
would be a ironic fate for an old Civil War boat.''

   They used to be called scofflaws, tax evaders,
black marketeers and worse, but they're getting new dignity now as
``the informal sector,'' and they could be one key to better life
for people in the Third World.
   They include a wide range of enterprising people. There's the
little boy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, who buys a package of
cigarettes and sells them one by one on a street corner. He pays no
tax or license fee and makes a small profit.
   There are also the 70 families of squatters in a Latin American
capital who stole their electricity when the power company refused
to sell it.
   A study published last week by the private World Resources
Institute with two United Nations agencies pulled together much of
the investigation done on what economists have dubbed the informal
sector.
   It said many planners now see it as probably the greatest source
of new jobs in Third World cities.
   In the year 2000, Mexico City is expected to have more than 27
million people and Bombay, India, more than 15 million. That gives
plenty of room for volunteer groups that in many places already
help supply drinking water, sanitation, small loans and even
recycling services.
   By the standards of industrialized countries, the pay or profit
is low. But even in what the World Bank calls upper-middle-income
countries, such as Brazil or Malaysia, the average income is around
$2,000 a year, one-tenth the U.S. average.
   The World Bank, biggest source of aid to the Third World, found
the electricity thieves in an unnamed Latin American capital. It
said the leader of a squatter community told of going to the
manager of the power company and being informed that it could not
sell to them.
   ``In the end he decided to be indulgent with us, in exchange for
our promise that we would not abuse our arrangement by `going too
far' with domestic connections,'' the leader was quoted as saying.
   ``The fact is that we do not pay for electricity now. It is
free, and we have been able to light our streets, our school and
our homes. If there were anything else that we needed and if the
government were unwilling to give it to us, then we would just take
it without authorization.''
   A study published by the Johns Hopkins University Press told of
shantytown dwellers who collect waste in Montevideo, Uruguay, and
separate the types for recycling. But the necessary washing of
plastics takes too much labor. So they farm out that part of the
job to small family enterprises that can do it more cheaply.
   The same study reported that in Niamey, Niger, tinsmiths and
blacksmiths recycled scrap metal and made 30,000 stoves in two
years. The efficient stoves cut the consumption of scarce fuel wood.
   It estimated that in most Third World countries the informal
sector includes 30 percent to 70 percent of the working population.

   The mobilization of thousands of people to
march for animals marks a milestone in the animal rights movement,
activists say.
   ``There is no question we are making progress,'' organizer Tom
Regan said Sunday after a rally which featured celebrities such as
singer Grace Slick and ``Superman'' movie star Christopher Reeve.
   Regan, a professor of philosophy at North Carolina State
University, said the animal rights movement is one that advocates
lifestyle changes. Regan, for instance, does not eat meat.
   U.S. Capitol Police estimated 24,000 people attended the first
``March for the Animals,'' along with a rally on the steps of the
Capitol.
   Organizers claimed more than 50,000 people from around the
country showed up for the one-mile march down Pennsylvania Avenue
to the Capitol.
   Marchers chanted ``Animal Rights _ Now.'' Many carried banners
and placards with pictures and slogans saying things such as
``Animals Are Not for Wearing,'' ``Fur Is Dead,'' and ``Animals
Have Rights, Too.''
   Some brought their dogs.
   Peter Linck of the National Alliance for Animal Legislation said
the rally was a show of unity among diverse groups that advocate a
range of programs from saving elephants in the wild and banning
furs to ending use of animals in medical research and changing the
way veal is produced.
   The most controversial position of animal rights activists deals
with their opposition to use of animals in medical research _ a
view the nation's top health officials say is misguided, out of
step with the position of a majority of responsible members of the
scientific community and a potential threat to medical advances.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has
criticized animal rights advocates who use violence and
intimidation to block testing of animals. ``They are on the wrong
side of morality,'' he said last week.
   Sullivan said some of the greatest advances in medicine, such as
the cure for polio, never would have been achieved had animals not
been used in tests.
   Dr. Frederick Goodwin, head of the U.S. Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Administration, said in an interview Sunday that
animals provide the ``critical linchpin between the petri dish and
people.''
   Tests using animals are employed about 20 percent of the time by
biomedical researchers, he said. Without those tests, advances in
finding a cure for AIDS, for instance, would stop, he said.
   But Slick, once the lead singer for the Jefferson Starship
group, said she was opposed to animal testings in laboratories.
   ``I'm for all angles of animal rights,'' Slick said.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., head of the informal Congressional
Friends of Animals group, said he opposes the ``unnecessary,
duplicative and cruel use of animals in medical and other areas.''
   Barbara Huffman of Freemont, Wis., president of the American
Veal Association, said she was angry about allegations that veal
producers are cruel to animals. Activists claim the calves are
chained and force-fed drug-laden food before their slaughter at age
four months.
   ``We are producing a safe and plentiful food supply,'' she said.
``We provide the best care for our animals that we can.''
   Several bills pending in Congress deal with the animal rights
issue. Among then is one to protect animals in testing of
cosmetics, one to prohibit the confinement of veal calves in small
crates and another to end hunting and trapping on wildlife refuges.
   A separate bill would impose jail terms on activists who attack
farms or research labs.
   Among the groups participating in the march were the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, the U.S. Humane Society and the Doris
Day Animal League.

   Each Friday they march, circling the
front steps of the courthouse with signs protesting the
first-degree murder conviction of a black teen-ager by an all-white
jury.
   In Massachusetts, that conviction means life without parole,
almost unheard of in a homicide stemming from a street fight.
   ``There's nothing on either side to suggest that it was anything
but happenstance that they came together,'' said David Hoose, the
attorney for Charles Fryar.
   The black 18-year-old was convicted April 3 of stabbing
21-year-old Eric Palmer during a confrontation last year between
black youths and white students from Springfield College. Hoose
blamed the fight on alcohol and hotheaded youth.
   The conviction galvanized blacks in this city of 150,000,
sparking two big rallies, a fund-raising effort that has netted
more than $7,000 and lunchtime vigils outside the Hampden County
Hall of Justice every Friday by up to a dozen people.
   ``I think people are finally tired of the double standard that's
handed out at the Hall of Justice,'' said Norma Baker, a leader of
the African-American Coalition.
   The Supreme Judicial Court, in a move unrelated to the Fryar
case, has ordered a study of racial and ethnic bias in the state's
legal system.
   The vigils have been going on for about six weeks. The Rev.
Edward Harding said he plans to keep appearing at them until at
least Sept. 11, the trial date for Lester Jowers, the other person
charged in Palmer's slaying.
   Coalition members want to keep the controversy alive while
Fryar's appeal moves through the courts.
   ``We expect that we're going to have to do this over the next
couple of years,'' Baker said.
   The coalition, a group of directors of local social service
agencies, has focused on the jury selection system, maintaining
that there are not enough minorities on Hampden County juries. The
minority population of Springfield is about 30 percent, but that
drops to about 6 percent countywide.
   Paul Carr, state jury commissioner, defended the Massachusetts
system. State law, he said, requires cities to conduct a census of
everyone over 17. Those names are fed into a computer, and jury
pools are drawn at random.
   Before budget cutbacks forced the adoption of a mail census, the
Springfield Election Commission used off-duty police officers or
postal workers to compile names by going door-to-door. Coalition
members said off-duty police officers may intimidate some
minorities.
   In the Fryar case, only two prospective jurors were black, Hoose
said.
   Prosecutor William T. Walsh Jr., who has since left the district
attorney's office for private practice, said he thought the verdict
was fair and that a different racial makeup on the jury would have
made no difference.
   Fryar supporters said they're not claiming that a black jury
would have let him off lightly. But, said Hoose, ``an all-white
jury is going to relate more on a subtle level to the white
students who testified.''
   The lawyer said he did not argue in court that if jurors
believed Fryar guilty, they should convict on a charge less serious
than first-degree murder because he was bound to follow his
client's plea of innocence.
   ``There's still a fall-back position (for appeal) which is, of
course, even if he did do it, it's manslaughter and second-degree
murder at the worst,'' Hoose said.

   A hospitalized Elizabeth Taylor has
a new boyfriend _ a 23-year-old who is lifting the actress' spirits
and has her ``blooming again, like a rose,'' a spokeswoman says.
   Miss Taylor, 58, is fighting severe depression as she recovers
from pneumonia at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   Doctors on Sunday performed an abdominal biopsy, finding no new
lung infection, said Miss Taylor's spokeswoman Chen Sam. Miss
Taylor is expected to be released from the hospital within two
weeks.
   The actress decided to make public her relationship with Julian
Lee Hobbs of Lake Orion, a suburb of Detroit, so he can be at her
side, said Ms. Sam.
   ``It's a very romantic story,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Hobbs and Miss Taylor have been involved since 1988, said Lisa
Flowers, another spokeswoman. They will spend a short time at the
actress' Bel-Air home before traveling to Switzerland for a long
rest, Ms. Flowers said.
   ``She is very depressed. It's a very sad situation,'' said Ms.
Flowers. ``Julian was out of the picture for so long, and now he is
back in. She is blooming again, like a rose.''
   No other details about Hobbs were released.
   The star of ``Butterfield 8,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and more than 50 other films has
been married seven times.
   Apparently out of the picture is Miss Taylor's latest reported
love interest, truck driver Larry Fortensky. Ms. Flowers said
security people removed him last week from Miss Taylor's Bel-Air
home.
   Sunday's biopsy, which took less than an hour using a fiber
optic device, came two months after Miss Taylor's hospitalization
for a near-fatal bout with pneumonia. Her condition was complicated
by a yeast infection of the blood.
   ``Maybe if he (Julian) had been in the picture two months ago,
things would have been different. Julian is what makes her happy,''
Ms. Flowers said.

<HEAD>Voters Reject Free-Market Shock Therapy in Vote for Fujimori</HEAD>

   In giving political newcomer Alberto Fujimori
a landslide presidential victory, the people of this economically
crippled nation rejected the free-market shock therapy advocated by
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
   Fujimori, an agronomist and the son of Japanese immigrants,
captured Sunday's runoff by 13 to 19 points, according to exit
polls conducted by independent firms.
   Official returns were not expected for at least three weeks
because of poor communication with mountain and jungle regions.
   Vargas Llosa, a celebrated novelist, conceded defeat three hours
after polls closed. He told supporters he wished Fujimori ``success
in the difficult responsibility the Peruvian people have placed on
him.''
   He urged Peruvians to put the bitterly fought campaign behind
them. Vargas Llosa had been the early favorite. He won the most
votes in the first round of voting on April 8 _ but not the
majority needed for election.
   Fujimori, a 51-year-old former university rector, ran a
shoe-string campaign against Vargas Llosa's well-heeled Democratic
Front coalition.
   A political unknown just months ago, Fujimori gained the support
of Peru's poor, Protestant evangelists and leftists opposed to
Vargas Llosa's plans to privatize state industries and lift price
controls.
   He takes charge of a country where four in five people lack a
steady job, annual inflation is 2,000 percent and violence related
to the Maoist-inspired Shining Path insurgency has claimed more
than 18,500 lives in the last decade.
   ``I realize it will be a titanic task,'' Fujimori said soberly
Sunday night, addressing reporters. He invited all political
parties to participate in his government in areas where agreements
could be reached.
   Fujimori's critics accused him of ties to the Aprista Party of
President Alan Garcia. Many people blame the populist policies of
Garcia, who by law could not run for re-election, for Peru's
desperate economic situation.
   Fujimori, who begins his five-year term on July 28 in a country
weathering its worst economic crisis of the century, has said
little about the makeup of his administration. He has said,
however, that he would not appoint members of the Aprista Party to
his Cabinet.
   Vargas Llosa, 54, had pledged harsh austerity measures to revive
the economy while Fujimori advocated continued price controls and
subsidies for basic goods and services.
   Fujimori said his government would stress economic development
over military and police repression as the best way to fight both
leftist guerrillas and cocaine trafficking.
   He did not indicate where the money would come from for economic
development. The Peruvian treasury is $100 million in the red.
   Peru is the world's main source of coca leaf, the raw material
for cocaine. The U.S. government is pressuring Peru to reduce its
coca production, and has offered to send U.S. soldiers to train
Peruvian troops in jungle warfare methods to fight guerrillas.
   Fujimori said he shared Vargas Llosa's view that Peru ``must be
reinserted into the world financial community'' and said he would
seek to renegotiate Peru's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Garcia suspended foreign debt payments early in his government
and international lending agencies eventually cut off credit to
Peru.
   Many attributed Vargas Llosa's loss to a multi-million dollar
media campaign that angered people in this country of 22 million
people where the average annual income is $900 and the minimum wage
is $45 a month.
   Vargas Llosa is widely associated by the South American
country's indigenous and mixed-race majority with the
European-descended coastal elite.
   Thousands of campaign supporters paraded and celebrated early
today outside the run-down headquarters of Fujimori's Change 90
party in downtown Lima.
   The independent polling firm Apoyo gave Fujimori 51.1 percent of
the vote to 37.8 percent for Vargas Llosa, with 11.1 percent blank
and null votes. POP, another independent polling firm, showed
Fujimori with 56 percent and Vargas Llosa 36.5 percent. POP put
blank and null votes at 7.5 percent.
   Nearly 10 million Peruvians were registered to vote, and the law
requires them to cast ballots.
   As the polls opened Sunday, armored helicopters crisscrossed
Lima's skies. Tanks and troop carriers patrolled the streets of the
capital, home to about 7 million people.
   Little violence was reported around the country on Sunday
despite threats by the Shining Path to disrupt the elections.
   At least 10 bombs exploded Sunday in Huancayo, a highland
farming center 120 miles east of Lima. Police said that one, placed
by guerrillas at a polling station, killed one person and wounded
eight.
   In a separate attack, rebels shot and killed three brothers.
Police said a note was found on one of the bodies that said, ``This
is how informers die.''
   Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, said Sunday that he
would seek improved relations with countries of the Pacific basin.
   ``I understand that in the land of my ancestors there is great
interest in my election,'' he said.

   Four months ago, Alberto Fujimori was a
complete newcomer to politics.
   Those who did know the soft-spoken, 51-year-old agricultural
engineer knew him as the former rector of the respected National
Agrarian University.
   Now, this son of Japanese immigrants has astounded Peruvians
with a meteoric rise from obscurity. They call it ``Fujimania.''
   Fujimori sold his house, car, and tractor just to raise campaign
funds.
   He avoided specifics, speaking mainly of broad social goals like
improved health care and revitalized industry.
   He sometimes resorted to attention-getting gimmicks, such as
dressing like a samurai warrior for news photographers.
   Whatever the formula, it worked.
   Fujimori claimed to be the only candidate truly independent of
``professional politicians.'' But during the campaign, he showed
political skill honed during his years of running a university in a
country where universities are highly politicized.
   Fujimori is the oldest of five children, the son of a tailor
from the southern Japanese island of Kyushu who came to Peru in
1934 to work its coastal cotton plantations.
   His father worked at various jobs, including an upholstery shop
he opened in Lima. The family lost the business during a boycott of
Japanese businesses during World War II.
   In 1960, Fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering
from the National Agrarian University, where he later taught
mathematics.
   He served as the school's rector from 1984 to 1989. He did
post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and the
University of Strasburg in France.
   Fujimori got a peek at the circles of power by serving for two
years as an agricultural adviser to the outgoing government of
President Alan Garcia.
   He speaks Spanish, Japanese, English, French and German.
   He describes himself as studious, introverted and lacking all
``common vices.'' He says work is his hobby, that he devotes 12 to
13 hours a day to it.
   Along with their four children, Fujimori and his wife, Susana
Higuchi, had been running their own three-acre farm before the race.
   In his brief time in the political spotlight, Fujimori has been
surrounded by controversy. Critics say the agriculture university
went into sharp decline under his leadership.
   He has been charged with evading taxes on the sale of various
properties and with illegally benefitting from a land-distribution
program designed to aid peasants.
   In addition, his close connections with Peru's evangelical
community prompted the country's Roman Catholic Church to take the
unusual step of voicing support for the man he defeated, celebrated
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
   Fujimori has been accused of having close ties to the ruling
Aprista Party and critics claim he is a ``Trojan Horse'' through
which Garcia will retain power.
   The large majority of Peru's 60,000-member Japanese immigrant
community supported Vargas Llosa.
   But Fujimori was overwhelmingly supported by millions of Peru's
poor, who account for more than 50 percent this country of 22
million.
   ``The poor needed an alternative to Vargas Llosa and the failed
policies of the present government,'' said Jorge Castillo, of the
private polling company Datum. ``Fujimori is a candidate invented
by the electorate.''
   Fujimori has compared his campaign strategy to the martial arts.
   ``You take advantage of the forces of the other _ boom boom _
wherever they lead,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview
during the campaign, slicing his hand through an imaginary brick.
   Thus, he attacked Vargas Llosa's free-market platform while
remaining vague about many of his own ideas.
   Usually dressed in a three-piece suit, Fujimori appeared stiff
and serious among potential voters, but they warmed to him and his
promises of discipline and hard work.
   He says his political movement, called simply Change 90, is an
``expression of people who are tired of the old, corrupt political
parties and who just want to work.''

   The woman who took her life with the press
of a button was called a ``pioneer in the battle for death with
dignity'' at a memorial service she planned as carefully as her
suicide.
   ``To die a little later, or a little sooner, does not matter,''
the Rev. Alan G. Deale said Sunday at the service for Janet Elaine
Adkins.
   What matters is ``to live bravely, to love wisely, to see how
beautiful the trees are, and even the sea _ to enjoy the world,''
said her minister.
   Mrs. Adkins, a 54-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease,
selected the music and speakers for the service before traveling to
Michigan to end her life by means of a drug-injecting machine built
by medical maverick Dr. Jack Kevorkian.
   Kevorkian, who is under investigation by prosecutors and medical
regulators, did not attend the service.
   An exceptional woman in life, ``Janet would become famous in
death,'' Deale told friends and family members at the First
Unitarian Church of Portland.
   ``The public attention that her death has received is an
indication of the level of interest in this phenomenon,'' he said,
describing her as a ``pioneer in the battle for death with
dignity.''
   The minister said he believed she had the right to her decision.
   In 1988, the Unitarian Universalist Association adopted a
resolution acknowledging circumstances in which the dignity of life
could be compromised and supporting an individual's right to choose
death.
   ``Janet loved life, but she didn't fear death,'' said Judy
Humiston, one of three friends who remembered Adkins' love of good
conversation, philosophy, music, travel, teaching and tennis.
   Family members occasionally had tears in their eyes, but the
spirit of the hourlong ceremony was joyful. Deale said that was
Mrs. Adkins' wish.
   Carol Rehmke recalled with a smile that Adkins loved to win.
   ``Janet taught me to play chess and we played by mail,'' said
Rehmke. ``She won the first game and I won the second. And we never
played the third game.''
   A string quartet played a selection by the Russian composer
Alexander Borodin. A string duo performed the pop song ``When I
Need You.''
   Adkins is survived by her husband, Ron; their adult sons, Neil,
Norman and Ronald; three grandchildren, and her mother.

   The supertanker burning in the Gulf of Mexico carried more than
three times the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez off Alaska last
year. But authorities said that if the Mega Borg sank, it might not
cause as big a catastrophe.
   Two key differences: The Mega Borg's cargo was light crude,
which disperses much more rapidly than the heavy crude carried by
the Exxon Valdez; and fire is consuming the Mega Borg's oil.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil _
about one-fifth of the 987-foot ship's cargo _ when it ran aground
on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, 25 miles from the port of
Valdez, on March 24, 1989.
   It was the nation's worst oil spill. More than 1,100 miles of
Alaska shoreline were soiled. Thousands of birds, mammals and other
wildlife were killed.
   The Mega Borg was carrying 38 million gallons of light crude
when it was wracked by explosions and fire on Saturday about 57
miles southeast of Galveston, Texas. At first, little oil spilled,
but five powerful explosions Sunday sent blazing crude pouring into
the Gulf.
   The Mega Borg was listing and apparently in greater danger of
sinking than the Exxon Valdez was. The fire, however, appeared to
be consuming much of its oil.
   ``It causes some air pollution, but that dissipates,'' said
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson. ``What would be worse
would be for it to sit on the surface and drift toward shore.''
   Even if that happened, the light crude would disperse much more
rapidly than heavy crude, Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene said.
   A spill about one mile long north of the vessel and one about 20
miles long to the south were visible Sunday evening. Officials
estimated the slicks contained 7,000 gallons of oil.
   Currents and winds were expected to push the oil toward a 150-to
200-mile stretch of Texas coast between Freeport and Corpus
Christi. But Greene said inshore currents could keep the spill
washing ashore.
   If it reached shore, however, the spill could jeopardize a
wildlife refuge, salt marshes, oyster reefs and other crucial
habitat, environmentalists said.
   ``I hate the thought of it,'' said Brandt Mannchen of the Sierra
Club.
   ``The entire Galveston Bay is extremely valuable for both
recreational fishermen and commercial fishermen,'' said Alan Allen,
executive director of the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas.
   A November 1979 spill in Galveston Bay was in some ways
comparable to both the Valdez spill and the Mega Borg blast. The
tanker Burmah Agate collided with a tanker and up to 10.7 million
gallons of oil spilled _ but much of it burned off before reaching
shore.

   President Guillero Endara says he
loves three things in this world: God, the Panamanian people and
his new bride.
   Endara, 54, married 23-year-old Ana Mae Diaz in a two-hour,
Roman Catholic ceremony Sunday at Metropolitan Cathedral.
Ambassadors of the United States and Latin American and European
countries were among the guests.
   Endara was installed during the invasion of Panama by U.S.
forces that overthrew Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   About 250 people waited outside the cathedral in a heavy rain to
throw rice at the newlyweds.
   The couple met at a university rally after Panama's 1989
elections. Endara won that election, but Noriega annulled the
results.
   Endara was widowed a year ago. He has a daughter and a grandson,
who was the ring bearer at the ceremony. The president declared
that there are three things he loves: ``God, the Panamanian people
and Ana Mae.''
   Endara wore a black suit, white shirt and gray tie. The bride

   For 17 years Anjelica Huston lived in the
limelight of her lover, Jack Nicholson. But now, with Nicholson out
of the picture, she is stepping into her own spotlight.
   Their erratic relationship came to an end last year when
Nicholson had an affair with a former waitress, Rebecca Broussard,
who had Nicholson's baby in April.
   Huston, who won an Oscar for her role in ``Prizzi's Honor,''
said her recent screen work has mirrored and helped manage her life.
   She appeared in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as a woman rejected
by her married lover. When she finished ``Enemies, A Love Story,''
in which she plays a woman whose husband has a child by another
woman, she went home to the harsh reality of Nicholson's infidelity.
   ``That very much reflected what was to go on in my life directly
after I came back to Los Angeles after the movie. That was pretty
close to the bone,'' she said.
   Huston said she doesn't know if she is ready to be part of a
couple again.
   ``I'm selfish and opinionated,'' she said. ``I think I follow
less than I used to. It's hard for me to sit and nod my head at
repeated stories anymore.''

   Carroll Shelby, designer of the muscle car
that bears his name, is doing well after a heart transplant, a
spokesman says.
   ``He's doing fine, according to the hospital's transplant
coordinator,'' the spokesman, Glenn Campbell, said Sunday. He said
Shelby hasn't been able to get out of bed yet, but ``the recovery
is going along normally.''
   Shelby, 67, received the heart during a four-hour operation at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Thursday night. No information on
the donor was released.
   Shelby is a three-time U.S. Sports Car driver of the year and
designer of the Shelby Cobra. He also worked as a consultant for
Chrysler Motors on the design of its new Viper sports car.
   The popular Texan, whose chili recipes have become as famous as
his race car designs and auto customizing, suffered from congestive
heart failure, Wise said. Shelby had heart surgery in 1973 and 1978.

   Members of the raunchy rap group 2
Live Crew became ``martyrs for the First Amendment'' when they were
arrested on obscenity charges after a concert, their lawyer says.
   Band leader Luther ``Luke Skyywalker'' Campbell and Chris
``Fresh Kid Ice'' Wongwon were arrested by more than a dozen
sheriff's detectives early Sunday.
   They were charged with singing lyrics from their
platinum-selling album, which was ruled obscene by a federal judge
in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``If we had to do it again, we'd do it again,'' Wongwon said
before the Miami rappers took the stage in Phoenix on Sunday night.
   ``We were arrested for playing to adults,'' he said. He added
that Broward County (Fla.) Sheriff Nick Navarro has a racial bias
against their music.
   ``It's a black company, it's a black group,'' he said.
   Campbell, 29, and Wongwon, 26, were freed without bail after two
hours in jail. The misdemeanor carries up to a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   The other band members, Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross and David
``Mr. Mixx'' Hobbs, left Hollywood's Club Futura in a separate car
and were not stopped. Navarro said arrest warrants would be issued
for them today.
   ``They could have rapped anything up to and including `White
Christmas,''' said sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon. ``As long as they
didn't sing anything from `As Nasty As They Wanna Be,' ... they
would not have been arrested.''
   The rappers' attorney, Bruce Rogow, said the judge's ruling,
Friday's arrest of a Fort Lauderdale record store owner who sold
the album to undercover agents, and the arrests of band members
show Navarro and other anti-obscenity crusaders are ``out of
control.''
   ``Now everybody's rallying around the First Amendment and,
incidentally, around 2 Live Crew,'' Rogow said. ``It's made them
martyrs for the First Amendment.''
   The arrests gave 2 Live Crew publicity it would not otherwise
have received, he said.
   ``There was a lot of sex _ real sex, nude dancing, prostitution
_ going on in Broward County last night,'' Rogow said. ``The
criminals must have a had a field day. This is nothing more than
talking dirty.''
   In Phoenix Sunday night, the band sang two ``clean'' songs at a
concert with seven other bands. Concert organizers said the rappers
were asked not to perform the X-rated versions.
   The band refused to go along with a similar request at their
adults-only concert Sunday in Hollywood, where they screamed
profanities along with a wildly gyrating audience of about 400.
   Undercover detectives documented the band's performance, which
included repeated insults against Navarro.
   ``We didn't want to create any commotion in there, so I told
them to let them get out of there and arrest them away from the
premises,'' said Navarro.
   Deputies pulled over Campbell and Wongwon's car several blocks
from the club.
   Rogow said he believes U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez's
ruling Wednesday did not make it illegal to sing the songs in a
setting like Club Futura.

<HEAD>Man Regarded as World's Oldest, John Evans, Dies At Age 112</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Welsh coal miner who was considered the
world's oldest man has died in his sleep at age 112, his
daughter-in-law says.
   John Evans had firmly believed that his longevity was due to not
drinking, smoking, swearing or gambling.
   ``But some part of it is taking hot water in the morning ...
(with) a small bit of honey. I've been doing that since I
retired,'' he told the British Broadcasting Corp. on his 111th
birthday in 1988.
   Betty Evans said her father-in-law died early Sunday in a chair
beside his bed at his cottage in Forest-fach, near Swansea, Wales,
after feeling ``a little unwell'' for a few days.
   The 1990 Guinness Book of Records said Evans was considered the
world's oldest living man because he had a birth certificate
proving his age.
   It says the oldest living person whose birth date can be
authenticated is a 115-year-old woman, Carrie C. White, born in
Gadsden, Fla., on Nov. 18, 1874. She lives in a nursing home in
Palatka, Fla.
   Evans was born on Aug. 19, 1877, when Queen Victoria was on the
British throne. He started working in coal mines when he was 13,
and only stopped at age 73 because of National Coal Board mandatory
retirement rules.
   Evans was fitted with a pacemaker when he was 108. Doctors at
Cardiff Hospital said at the time they thought he was the oldest
person to undergo the operation and were astounded when he was able
to return home three days later.
   ``It's given me a new lease of life _ and I don't have to go
back to have new batteries put in for another 10 years'' he joked
at the time.
   Evans had a wheelchair but preferred a walking stick. He worked
in his garden until he was 95, planting potatoes and other
vegetables.
   Like many Welshmen, he loved to sing.
   ``I've been doing that since I was a little boy. Going to Sunday
school, I'd sing, plenty of it,'' he said in the BBC interview.
   In 1987, Evans visited London, 190 miles away, to celebrate his
110th birthday. He said he thought of making the trip in 1900 but
couldn't afford the $2.50 it cost then for the train ticket.
   Evans' 79-year-old son, Amwel, had his own explanation for his
father's long life.
   ``My father always had a very lively mind and just loved life,''
he said Sunday. ``I'm sure that had everything to do with his
remarkable health. We're all very sad _ but very proud of him
today.''
   Mrs. Evans, Amwel's wife, said: ``A big gap has been left in our
lives. The longer John was with us, the harder it was going to be
to say goodbye.
   Evans lived with Amwel and Betty.
   He is survived by two other sons and a daughter, six
grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Funeral plans have not
been announced.
   Norris McWhirter, founding editor of the Guinness Book of
Records, said Sunday that it is not yet known who succeeds Evans as
the oldest man:
   ``The absolute world record for longevity was held by Shigechiyo
Izumi of Japan, who died on February 21, 1986, aged 120 years, 237
days.''

<HEAD>Dollar Soars, Stocks Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar soared against the Japanese yen today,
pushing down share prices across the board on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 154.10 yen, up 1.45 yen from Friday's close
of 152.65 yen. It opened at the day's low of 153.35 yen and rose as
high as 154.20 yen.
   Its close was the highest since 154.15 yen on May 11.
   Traders attributed the dollar's rise to its gain on overseas
markets at the end of last week and concern about the governing
Liberal Democratic Party's loss of an upper house by-election on
Sunday.
   The dollar still is being helped by continued unrest in the
Soviet Union and uncertainties about the impact of German
unification, they added.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell
453.11 points, or 1.37 percent, closing at 32,540.18.
   Dealers said the yen's weakness against the dollar and the
governing party's defeat in Sunday's by-election discouraged
investors.
   ``Negative factors pulled down bond prices and Nikkei index
futures, leading to a sharp deline in share prices as well,'' said
a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A trader with Nomura Securities Co. said Friday's 34.95-point
decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York further
discouraged market players.
   He said that while shares prices were lower almost all across
the board, large capital shares, such as heavy industry and steel
issues, were particularly weak.
   The governing party's defeat in the by-election triggered
concern in the market that it has not fully recovered from the
distrust caused by recent money and sex scandals and the
introduction of an unpopular tax.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond fell to 87.18 points at 5 p.m. from
Friday's 87.78-point finish. The yield rose to 7.140 percent from
Friday's 7.015 percent.

   A 90-foot tear discovered on the bottom
of a cruise ship threatened a spill of 110,000 gallons of diesel
fuel today off Cape Cod, the Coast Guard said.
   The ship ran onto rocks in heavy fog and began taking on water
Sunday, but the more than 1,060 passengers and crew members were
evacuated and damage was at first believed confined to small tears
that spilled up to 1,500 gallons of fuel.
   However, divers late Sunday discovered a 2-foot-wide tear that
exposed four of the Bermuda Star's fuel tanks containing 110,000
gallons of diesel, said Coast Guard spokesman Steve Aitkins.
   ``The potential exists for a medium to high probability of a
major oil spill,'' the Coast Guard said in a statement.
   Cleanup workers manned booms around the 617-foot ship to corral
the fuel, and used absorbent material to soak up the spill.
   Aitkins said that pressure from sea water was keeping most of
the diesel in its tanks but that the fuel would have to be unloaded
before the vessel could be moved for repairs.
   The Coast Guard hoped to inspect the vessel at daybreak and use
pumps on board to transfer the fuel into the ship's undamaged tanks
or into other vessels, Aitkins said.
   Earlier, he said the Coast Guard would charge Bermuda Star
Cruise Line, the ship's owner, with federal pollution charges.
   The captain, Hans Lewing, and other crew members were given
blood and alcohol tests, which are routine after accidents. Results
were expected today.
   The vessel, on a cruise from New York to Nova Scotia, went
aground about five miles off Woods Hole while passengers were
having breakfast. Tugboats freed it 13 hours later. The passengers
and some of the crew were ferried to shore.
   Flooding through the holes in the hull was under control by
midday.
   Passenger Robert Lewis, Wichita Falls, Texas, said no one on
board panicked. ``It was kind of like we bumped into something,''
he said. ``There was a loud grinding noise, but no one seemed to be
scared.''
   Scot Graham, a Coast Guard marine safety officer in Providence,
R.I., said the ship was three hours ahead of schedule and
off-course when it ran aground. Fog had cut visibility to about a
quarter-mile, officials said.

   Community leaders sought to ease racial tensions
before today's sentencing of two white men convicted in the mob
attack in Bensonhurst that left a black teen-ager dead.
   Prosecutors said they would seek the maximum penalties for
Joseph Fama and Keith Mondello, both 19.
   The shooting death Aug. 23 of Yusuf Hawkins, 16, raised racial
tensions in the city during a mayoral campaign. Hawkins was
attacked after he and three friends went to the mostly white
Brooklyn neighborhood to look at a used car.
   Fama, named as the triggerman by his co-defendants, was
convicted May 17 of murder, riot and other crimes. He faced up to
32 and two-thirds years to life in prison.
   Mondello, the mob's alleged organizer, was acquitted a day later
of murder and manslaughter but convicted of riot and other offenses.
   Prosecutors said they would seek consecutive sentences for
Mondello, which could keep him in prison for five and one-third to
16 years, and the maximum sentence of 25 years to life for Fama on
the murder charge.
   With the Fama conviction, the city remained calm. But when
Mondello's verdict was delivered, crowds of blacks hurled rocks and
bottles in Brooklyn, and several white reporters were roughed up.
   In recent days, the Rev. Al Sharpton _ a flamboyant civil-rights
activist who has been accused of rabble-rousing and race-baiting _
played the peacemaker. He canceled a protest over the weekend in
Bensonhurst.
   ``We don't have to like each other, but we have to live with
each other,'' Sharpton said.
   Leaders of the largely Italian-American neighborhood promised to
work with the black community to help heal racial divisions.
   ``Bensonhurst will show the world that people who have been
represented as enemies can come together and live the life of the
lamb, not the lion,'' said Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, a Brooklyn
Democrat.

   Using too much water to douse the
fire aboard the Mega Borg could sink the oil supertanker, but
firefighters using foam to smother the flames today faced another
problem, salvage experts say.
   ``You have to get on that ship to extinguish it,'' said Les
Williams, whose Port Arthur, Texas, salvage company has fought
nearly two dozen offshore oil fires. ``If the fire's below deck,
it's like trying to walk on a hot skillet. You can't do that.''
   The fire burned since Saturday aboard the 853-foot Norwegian
ship, crippled in the Gulf of Mexico 57 miles southeast of
Galveston. It started with an explosion in the engine room on
Saturday; five blasts Sunday sent blazing crude oil from the
tanker's 38-million-gallon cargo into the sea.
   ``That's a very hard fire to fight, there in the engine room
like that,'' Rudy Teichmann of T&amp;T Marine Salvage Inc. in Galveston
said. ``It's all closed up and you can't get to it.
   ``They can't flood that engine room with water. That could sink
the ship. It's a lot different than fighting a forest fire,'' said
Teichmann.
   The Mega Borg already was listing. Its stern dropped 58 feet
since the first explosion, indicating either the cargo had shifted
or the ship was taking on water, the Coast Guard said. The aft deck
was reported just 5 feet above the water today.
   About 30,000 gallons of foam has been shipped to the scene, the
Coast Guard said. But using it entails firefighting at close range.
   Wiliams said the usual procedure is for two or three
firefighters, wearing fire-retardant jumpsuits that are light
enough to swim in, to board the tanker.
   Carrying a 3-inch diameter hose leading to foam pumps aboard a
nearby boat, they target the fire's point of origin, he said. The
hose, or ``wand,'' can shoot 5,000 gallons of foam per minute.
   Attempting the job is Smit American Salvage Inc., the U.S.
division of a Rotterdam company. Smit has helped fight more than
100 tanker and oil rig fires, including blazes in the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq war, company officials said.
   Steve Davis, captain of the 180-foot supply boat Tradewind, and
his crew of four spent Sunday loading drums of chemical foam on
board the boat to fight the Mega Borg fire.
   ``I would hate to see oil all over these beaches,'' Davis said
as specialists from the Netherlands finished bolting high-powered
pumps and nozzle connections to the ship's deck.
   Davis' boat is one of six from Pelican Island near Galveston
that were hired to fight the fire.
   ``God willing and weather permitting _ that's the saying in
salvage,'' said Rick Chianelli, salvage foreman for Smit American.

<TEXT>
   The renamed Communists held a commanding
lead today in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years, bucking
the anti-Communist trend in countries that emerged from the Soviet
orbit in the past year.
   The party, and once Moscow's most loyal follower, appeared
likely to become the only ruling party in Eastern Europe to retain
power in multiparty elections, according to projections from
independent polling organizations.
   However, opposition leaders charged that Sunday's parliamentary
vote had been marred by irregularities and more than 2,000
protesters demonstrated outside Parliament today, shouting
``fraud'' and calling for a general strike.
   Police cordoned off the building, and the crowd appeared to be
growing. The opposition scheduled a mass evening rally for downtown
Sofia.
   Independent projections gave the Socialists, heirs to the
long-ruling Communists, about 48 percent of the vote in Sunday's
parliamentary vote. The main opposition coalition, the Union of
Democratic Forces, had just under 35 percent. Official results were
expected later today.
   There were complaints from opposition officials that the
ballot-counting was moving very slowly. But Union chairman Zhelyu
Zhelev told reporters that he did not believe the opposition would
challenge the elections' validity.
   ``In the worst case we shall want new elections (in districts)
where there have been real flagrant violations,'' he said.
   The West German polling organization Infas said the opposition
won the capital of Sofia, where it was expected to receive about 55
percent of the vote against 38 percent for the Socialists, who
called themselves Communist until April.
   However, the Union lagged behind in the countryside, where
analysts had expected the opposition to have a tough time. For many
people outside Sofia, radical change is feared and the Socialists
represent stability.
   The Socialists favor introducing economic reforms gradually,
avoiding the ``shock therapy'' that has caused steep price rises
and widespread unemployment in Poland.
   The 16-party Union of Democratic Forces favors a swift move to a
market economy and restoring private ownership. Its supporters say
it offers the best guarantee of democratic change.
   The Socialists have said they want to govern in a coalition with
the opposition in order to get a broad-based consensus for tackling
the country's economic problems. Union leaders have ruled out such
a coalition.
   At least 84 percent of the country's 6.4 million eligible voters
cast ballots for the 400-seat Grand National Assembly, the Central
Election Commission said late Sunday.
   In all, 3,143 candidates from 38 parties ran for election to the
parliament. Half of the seats will be awarded on the basis of
proportional representation, the others allocated according to
results in 200 districts races. Runoffs are to be held Sunday where
no candidate wins a majority.
   Bulgaria is the fifth Eastern European country to hold free
parliamentary elections this year. The Communists suffered
resounding defeats in East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. In
Romaia, the National Salvation Front, a coalition dominated by
former Communists that took power after the overthrow and execution
of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, won multiparty elections.
   In Bulgaria, reform Communists engineered the nation's drive to
democracy, removing long-time hard-line Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov in November.
   President Petar Mladenov has won public support for initiating
reforms that included a renunciation of the party's monopoly on
power.
   The Bulgarian Communist Party also has deep roots in the
country. The party was founded in 1891, predating the Soviet
Communist Party.
   It captured 20 percent of the vote in 1932, the country's last
free elections, and has ruled Bulgaria since 1944.
   Opposition leaders charged that a Socialist victory would stem
from the continuing strong influence through patronage of the
Communist ``nomenklatura,'' or apparatus.
   But political observers said the Union lost potential supporters
because of poor leadership.
   The Association for Free and Fair Elections, a Bulgarian
monitoring group, said its vote projections gave the Socialists
48.3 percent of the vote against 34.9 percent for the Union and 8.3
percent for the Agrarian Party, formerly a docile ally of the
Communists. Infas had similar projections.
   The only other party projected to win seats was the Movement for
Rights and Freedoms, which was receiving about 80 percent of the
vote in areas heavily populated by the 1.5 million ethnic Turkish
minority, BTA reported.
   The projections gave the ethnic Turkish group from 5.7 to 8.4
percent of the vote nationwide.
   Thousands of Bulgarian and foreign observers monitored the
voting. There were only scattered reports of irregularities,
including allegations of stolen ballot papers and last-minute
campaigning banned under election law.
   Opposition campaign manager Petko Simeonov told a news
conference today that the Union believed the elections to have been
fair in most places. However, he said he gave election officials a
list of 211 cases of alleged violations.
   Simeonov said conditions for free elections had been secured in
most places, but ``there has been strong moral pressure on the
electorate, especially in small villages.''
   He claimed that after the voting, ``signals of different
violations of (election) procedure came like a tidal wave.''
   Beforehand, actor and opposition activist Yosif Serchadzhiev,
alleging electoral fraud in the village of Pazardzhik during an
appearance on live national televison, burst into tears and ran off
camera.
   Heated on-air exchanges and shouting followed.
   The main task of the new parliament will be to write a new
consititution to usher in democratic and economic reforms. The
parliament must also deal with a $10 billion foreign debt, growing
inflation and shortages of basic consumer items including sugar and
cheese.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against most major foreign
currencies in calm European trading today. Gold prices were higher.
   Continued unrest in the Soviet Union and confusion surrounding
the impact of German unification were supporting the dollar,
traders said.
   Working against it were fears the West German central bank would
intervene if the dollar moved too high.
   ``A majority of people are now talking about a higher dollar,''
said Gerhard Sunderdiek, a trader at Bank of America in Frankfurt.
   A trader in Milan, Italy, said the dollar was well bid, ``but
still trading without a particular direction.''
   He predicted U.S. economic indicators to be released later this
week would give the market some direction.
   The May producer price index is due for release Thursday. May's
consumer price index and April trade figures are due out on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.45 yen to a closing 154.10 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6959 West German marks, down from 1.6973
   _1.4435 Swiss francs, down from 1.4480
   _5.7097 French francs, down from 5.7155
   _1.9100 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9088
   _1,245.50 Italian lire, down from 1,248.50
   _1.1687 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1743
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6812, compared with $1.6843 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $354.50 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Friday. At midmorning, the city's major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $354.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $354.50, up from $354.00 Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.28 to close at a bid $355.75.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.99 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.02.

   Cool weather settled in the West today and scattered
thunderstorms threatened the Great Lakes region.
   Thunderstorms were forecast for portions of the Dakotas,
Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and the western Great Lakes states. New
England, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana also were in for gusty
winds and rain.
   Skies were cloudy early today in parts of New Mexico, Alaska,
Oregon and Washington. Early morning conditions were fair elsewhere.
   Daytime temperatures in the West were expected to be an average
of 8 to 16 degrees below normal. Daytime temperatures in the 60s
and 70s were forecast for portions of Washington, Arizona, Oregon
and Utah.
   California's forecast called for fair, dry conditions for most
of the week.
   Warm weather and scattered thunderstorms prevailed Sunday
throughout the United States. Strong storms hit the Southeast, the
central Plains and parts of Nevada.
   A late spring storm dumped more than an inch of rain on the Las
Vegas Valley, flooding streets and homes, knocking out power and
drowning a woman who was trapped in a car swept into a drainage
ditch.
   The Arkansas town of Rogers received more than 1.5 inches of
rain in 30 minutes Sunday. Rain also fell in New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas and the Florida peninsula.
   The nation's high Sunday was 102 degrees in Presidio, Texas.

   Hundreds of radical students, shouting
``Yankee go home,'' clashed with police today in Kwangju to protest
the reopening of a U.S. cultural center that has been repeatedly
attacked, news reports said.
   About 500 students hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police as
they tried to march into the streets of the southern city after an
anti-U.S. rally on the campus of Chosun University, the Yonhap News
Agency said.
   About 800 riot police blocked the university's main gate and
fired tear gas barrages each time the demonstrators charged out of
the campus, it said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests in the
two-hour clash in Kwangju, about 155 miles south of Seoul.
   Students had vowed to do try to block the reopening of the U.S.
cultural center in Kwangju, the site of a the bloody suppression of
a 1980 pro-democracy uprising against the military government of
the time.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is particularly strong in Kwangju. People
claim Washington condoned the use of lethal force against the 1980
demonstrators. About 200 civilians were killed in the crackdown and
at least 1,700 injured.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul closed the cultural center about a
year ago to protect staff members. The building had been the target
of 29 attacks over 10 years by protesters hurling rocks and
firebombs.
   U.S. officials decided to reopen the center in a new building
less than a mile away from the original site that they say is
easier to defend.
   In a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony today, U.S. Ambassador Donald
P. Gregg said the United States had erred by remaining silent for
nine years about the Kwangju uprising. He reiterated that
Washington was not involved in the suppression of the uprising.
   Last year, the U.S. government officially clarified its position
on Kwangju to a special committee of the South Korean National
Assembly, but radicals called it a cover-up.
   When Gregg visited Kwangju in January, he was the first U.S.
ambassador known to have been in the city since the uprising.
   During that visit, ``I came to realize that American silence had
contributed to a hardening of suspicions and mistrust on the part
of some of the people of this city toward the United States,''
Gregg said in remarks prepared for delivery at the ceremony.
   Police in Kwangju were placed on alert for Gregg's visit after
radical student leaders said they had formed ``death squads'' to
kidnap the U.S. ambassador and block the reopening of the center.
   About 1,000 riot police guarded the center during the ceremony,
which was attended by the city's mayor and other Korean officials.
But radicals did not disrupt the opening, U.S. officials in Seoul
said.
   Before the ceremony, Gregg told Korean reporters that ``those
who oppose the reopening of the cultural center are a minority.''
   Gregg said he was aware of the threats against him, but added
that they would not prevent the center from opening to the public.
   Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul and aide to then-Vice
President Bush during the Iran-Contra affair, has been a target of
radicals since he was named ambassador last year.
   In October, six students wielding iron pipes and homemade
explosives attacked his residence in Seoul. Gregg and his wife were
inside but escaped harm.
   Elsewhere today, the Seoul Appellate Court reduced the sentences
of a radical female student and a Roman Catholic priest who had
been convicted of illegally visiting Communist North Korea.
   Presiding Judge Song Chae-hon cited the changing political
climate on the Korean peninsula, including the easing of
restrictions on contact with North Korea, as grounds for reducing
the sentences.
   The court cut the prison sentence for Im Su-kyong, a 22-year-old
student, from 10 to five years, and reduced the prison term for the
Rev. Moon Gyu-hyon, 41, from eight to five years.
   Ms. Im gained national attention when she defied the government
by attending an international youth festival in the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang last July. The priest went to North Korea to
accompany her home, and both were arrested on their return in
August.

<HEAD>Former Army Chief Resigns Posts as Defense, Deputy Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand's former army chief, Gen.
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, resigned as defense minister and deputy
prime minister today just as the prime minister was to leave to
visit the United States.
   Chavalit, regarded by some as a future prime minister, took up
the two posts less than three months ago after retiring as head of
the armed forces. A resignation letter delivered to Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan today came after a weeklong series of attacks
by political opponents.
   Chavalit had complained of corruption within the government and
also was resented by those who opposed the army officer's presence
in the Cabinet.
   ``Present circumstances do not allow me to carry on serving my
country in the spirit I had intended,'' Chavalit's resignation
letter said.
   The announcement came just hours before Chatichai was to leave
for a weeklong visit to the United States, where he was to meet
with President Bush.
   Chatichai had no plans to call off the visit, government
officials said.
   A senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Chatichai had done nothing to prevent the attacks on Chavalit,
which were given prominence in local press reports.
   On Thursday, the Bangkok Post carried a front-page report that
Chalerm Yubamrung, a minister in the Prime Minister's Office, had
compared Chavalit's wife to a ``walking jewelry case.''
   It apparently was a response to charges by Chavalit of
corruption within the government. While army chief, Chavalit said
corrupt officials should ``have their heads chopped off.''
   Chalerm was quoted as saying that people should examine their
own backgrounds before making such comments.
   Corruption within the Chatichai government has been a major
target of opposition political parties, which were expected to
attempt a formal censure of the government when the prime minister
returns from the United States.
   The attacks came as Chavalit was in Tokyo acting as a mediator
at a failed round of Cambodian peace talks.
   ``Basically the past week Gen. Chavalit has been serving the
government by spending sleepless nights in Tokyo trying for some
progress on Cambodia,'' the army officer said.
   ``In the meantime at home so many hands were stabbing him in the
back, '' he said.
   Chavalit's entry into the Cabinet in late March stirred
controversy as he was not an elected member of Parliament. Students
and opposition groups called it a setback for democracy and accused
the former army chief of ``jumping the queue to political power.''

<TEXT>
   The federal government rarely names public
buildings after living people, but it's making an exception for
92-year-old Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle, one of the South's leading
civil rights advocates.
   The home of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was to be
renamed the Elbert Parr Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building today
after its oldest living judge.
   Last Christmas, an 11th Circuit judge was killed by a mail bomb
and a similar bomb was safely intercepted at the courthouse.
Another bomb killed a Savannah lawyer and one was sent to the NAACP
office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   But the ceremony for Tuttle was expected to recall an earlier
era when the court was the target of death threats and political
pressure because of landmark civil rights rulings.
   Tuttle was appointed by President Eisenhower in 1954, three
months after the Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board of Education
ruling struck down school desegregation.
   He became a leader of the old 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
_ now the 11th _ when it served as the legal battleground for the
civil rights movement.
   As chief judge from 1961 to 1967, Tuttle helped decide landmark
cases involving Jim Crow laws, voting rights, jury discrimination,
employment discrimination, reapportionment and school
desegregation, including the order to admit James Meredith to the
University of Mississippi.
   In a dissenting opinion, later adopted by the U.S. Supreme
Court, he argued in 1966 that Georgia's House of Representatives
could not refuse to seat Julian Bond for opposing the Vietnam War.
   Tuttle took senior, or semi-retired, status in 1968.
   Raised in California and Hawaii, Tuttle came to Atlanta in 1923
and with his brother-in-law founded a law firm that took on
controversial cases.
   It battled to win a new trial for a black man convicted of
raping a white woman and challenged a Georgia law under which a
black Communist was sentenced to 20 years on a chain gang for
distributing Communist Party literature.
   He became a state Republican leader in the 1940s after becoming
appalled at the whites-only policies of Georgia's Democratic Party.

   A skydiver who jumped from the 54th floor of
a skyscraper under construction died when his parachute didn't
open, and a friend who leaped with him and landed safely could face
charges, police said.
   Robert Morris Jr., 25, was pronounced dead early Sunday where he
landed. Rod Stoltzfus, 27, landed safely in a parking lot across
the street.
   The pair jumped off the Mellon Bank building at 5:50 a.m. Police
Lt. Giacomo Giovinetti said the two broke locks on the chain-link
fence surrounding the construction site to get into the building.
   Stoltzfus called his pastor and went with him to see Morris's
family before contacting police, according to Detective James
Mooney.
   Stoltzfus could be charged with risking a catastrophe, causing a
disturbance and disorderly conduct, police said. But after
interviewing him for four hours Sunday night, police said they
wanted to review the case before deciding whether to file charges.
   ``It's an irresponsible act, but it's not so cut and dried,''
Giovinetti said.
   ``Someone obviously lost a loved one,'' he said. ``I don't think
we should be insensitive about this. They could have injured people
on the ground, too.''
   Morris' father's worst fears were realized. Robert Morris Sr., a
skydiver with 2,000 jumps to his credit, said he worried about his
only son's passion for jumping from buildings and bridges and hoped
he would tire of it.
   ``He liked the thrill of it,'' the elder Morris said. ``I just
hope and pray no one ever does it again.''
   It was the second time in less than a year that jumpers have
parachuted off the building.
   A man identified as a New York waiter jumped off the 47th floor
of the same skyscraper last Aug. 26. Three skydivers jumped off
another skyscraper in 1986 while it was under construction; none
was arrested.
   Most skydivers frown on such antics, said Al Gramando, owner of
the diving school Skydive Chambersburg.
   ``They bring a bad name on the parachuting world and we really
don't have much sympathy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebels Said To Win Control of International Airport</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and rebel negotiators headed
for neighboring Sierra Leone today for talks aimed at ending a
civil war that has closed in on the capital, prompting people to
evacuate by the thousands.
   Witnesses said rebels won control Sunday of the country's
international airport, which had been closed for a week by
fighting. They were also reported to have recaptured most of an
adjacent rubber plantation.
   In the capital of Monrovia 35 miles to the west, foreigners
converged by the hundreds on a small airfield on Sunday and got
evacuation flights out of the West African nation.
   The rebels trying to oust the government of President Samuel Doe
control most of Liberia, a country of 2.5 million people. The
5{-month-old civil war has left more than 1,000 dead.
   Witnesses said the rebels had on Sunday taken Smell-No-Taste, a
village that had a small army garrison a few hundred yards from the
Robertsfield International Airport runway, putting the airport
under their control.
   The village's names dates back to World War II, when U.S.
soldiers were camped at the airport and villagers nearby could
smell _ but never tasted _ their cooking.
   Today, peace talks were to begin at the U.S. Embassy in
Freetown, Sierra Leone. The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles
Taylor, and the government were sending delegations. The Liberian
Council of Churches was to mediate.
   People fleeing the fighting outside the capital said Sunday that
the rebels held most of the American-managed Bridgestone-Firestone
rubber plantation during the weekend.
   The rebels appeared to have cut off some of 300 government
troops who had been sent to recapture the world's largest rubber
plantation.
   Witnesses said soldiers appeared to have been driven into two of
the plantation's many compounds. With them were thousands of
refugees of who have fled fighting further north.
   The United States arranged to fly 362 people from the small
Spriggs Payne Airfield aboard three chartered Air Guinea flights to
Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, and then on today to Charleston,
S.C.
   ``We're tired, we're happy to be out, but we left a lot of
friends back there, so we're sorry for them,'' said Johnny
Connelly, a 26-year-old missionary from Madison, Ga., who arrived
in Abidjan Sunday with his wife, Janice, and their 2-year-old son,
Josiah.
   Rosalind Towe put her 3-year-old daughter, Zanwhea, an American,
aboard a flight out of Monrovia. Although the child is American,
Towe is Liberian and could not board the plane.
   ``It is better if she leaves,'' she said. ``If I have to run for
my life I can't run with her.''
   The West German Embassy said Sunday it had arranged for a
charter flight to evacuate its civizens today.
   Liberian troops pushed and shoved in desperate bids to get their
families on a government transport plane that was to fly dependents
to a safer part of the country.
   Among the refugees seeking the soldiers' protection were
civilians of Doe's Krahn tribe and the Mandingo tribe, who have
been targeted by rebels. Government troops in turn are accused of
killing civilians of the Gio and Mano tribes, to which many rebels
belong.
   Four residents of Harbel, the rubber plantation's company town,
said Sunday they had spent Friday night lying flat on the floor of
their home during fighting. They said the rebels had taken the town
Saturday.
   The situation at the plantation Sunday was not known.
   Two British frigates and four U.S. warships carrying 2,100
Marines sit off the coast in case remaining foreigners have to be
evacuated by sea.
   Missionary radio stations and newspapers carry stories daily of
nighttime raids on homes in poorer parts of the city by ``men
dressed in army uniforms.'' The euphemism refers to government
troops.
   The government admits its soldiers have been ``harassing''
civilians, and it has broadcast warnings that offenders will face
firing squads.
   Taylor's forces pushed south toward the capital since invading
Dec. 24 from neighboring Ivory Coast. The fighting sent more than
300,000 refugees fleeing to Monrovia and Ivory Coast, Guinea and
Sierra Leone.
   Rebels have captured the country's main iron mines and its chief
port, Buchanan, 95 miles southeast of Monrovia.

<TEXT>
   The two political groups that
broke the grip of Communist rule on Czechoslovakia today began the
search for coalition partners after winning the country's first
free elections in 44 years.
   A spokesman for President Vaclav Havel said the leader plans to
appoint a new premier within days and probably will give the job to
the incumbent, Marian Calfa, a former Communist who turned in his
party card in January.
   ``It is probable (Calfa) will be entrusted with the role of
forming a new government,'' presidential spokesman Michael
Zantovsky told a news conference today.
   Official results showed that Havel's Civic Forum and the group
Public Against Violence _ the Czech and Slovak sister organizations
that spearheaded the November pro-democracy revolt _ had captured
the most seats in a new federal parliament. Calfa was a top
candidate of Public Against Violence.
   The Communists, who were overthrown in the November uprising,
finished suprisingly strong, capturing second ahead of the
Christian Democrats.
   Turnout among the 11.2 million eligible voters was 96.7 percent,
the highest percentage in Eastern Europe's recent spate of free
elections.
   Civic Forum and its sister party won 169 of the 300 contested
seats in Parliament, but fell short of the three-fifths needed to
enact key constitutional and economic reforms that would fulfill
the goals of the revolution. The two political groups captured
about 46 percent of the vote.
   Civic Forum had said before the voting on Friday and Saturday
that it would seek a coalition government.
   ``We can say that the longing for freedom, democracy and a
different order prevailed in this election,'' Havel told state
television just after the results were announced Sunday.
   The Communists won just under 14 percent of the vote, and 48
seats. The Christian Democrats finished third with less than 12
percent, and 40 seats.
   Both Civic Forum and the Christian Democrats have ruled out a
coalition with the Communists.
   Three parties representing separatist, regional interests were
the only other groups to clear the 5 percent minimum vote required
in either the Czech or Slovak republic to get seats. The seat
totals for all the parties may change slightly under the complex
system of allocating votes.
   Civic Forum and Public Against Violence were likely to seek a
coalition with the three-party Christian Democratic alliance
despite campaign acrimony generated by charges that Josef
Bartoncik, a Christian Democratic leader, had been an informer for
the hated Communist secret police.
   Havel, a former dissident playwright who was a reluctant
candidate for office before the revolution, now seems virtually
certain to be elected for a two-year term by the new Parliament,
which has 40 days to decide.
   International observer groups expressed satisfaction about the
fairness of the balloting.

   President Bush extends the first White House
welcome ever to a leader of East Germany today in a meeting he says
dramatizes the ``magnificent changes'' sweeping Europe.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who came to office after free
elections in March what was once a hard-line communist state, heads
a government that is expected to make way soon for a single Germany
uniting East and West.
   Bush said Sunday he was eager to talk with de Maiziere ``about
his vision as to the postwar Europe, post-German unification
Europe.''
   The president planned to receive his visitor from the German
Democratic Republic in the Oval Office, hold expanded talks in the
Cabinet Room and then have lunch with de Maiziere in the White
House family quarters.
   De Maiziere is not only the first leader of East Germany to
visit the White House, he is almost certainly the last.
   The two Germanys are moving ahead next month with monetary union
on a footing that will provide massive subsidies from prosperous
West Germany for the financially strapped East.
   The date has not yet been set, but a pan-Germanic election could
be held as early as next January to make the country whole again,
ending the division imposed by the four allies who defeated Nazi
Germany in World War II.
   Bush, after dining Friday night with visiting West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, called de Maiziere's visit ``just one more
step that demonstrates the magnificent changes that have taken
place over the past year and a half.''
   The West's insistence that a united Germany be a full member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains a sticking point in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev insists that is
unacceptable for Soviet security. He wants Germany to keep a foot
in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush said Friday night that he would keep trying to convince the
Soviets that ``a united Germany in NATO will not be threatening to
the Soviet Union.''
   De Maiziere, 50, is chairman of the East German Christian
Democratic Union. He was responsible for church affairs in the
government of Hans Modrow, the last communist leader.
   De Maiziere arrived in New York on Saturday and met with Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor. On Sunday he met with bankers in
New York, as well as members of the World Jewish Congress.
   In a speech, de Maiziere said he understands Jewish concerns
about a unified Germany.
   ``Nevertheless, I wish to emphasize: no one needs to have
misgivings or even fears of a united Germany,'' he said. ``Germany
today is totally different from Germany between 1933 and 1945.''
   In addition to meeting today with Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, de Maiziere planned to lay a wreath at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, meet the
president of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and deliver a
lecture tonight at Georgetown University's Foreign Service School.
   On Tuesday he will meet with senators and members of the House
and speak at the National Press Club before returning to New York
for a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
He will leave for Berlin that evening.
   One of the first acts of East Germany's newly democratic
parliament this spring was to concede a share of the blame for the
Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Its
former communist rulers had refused to pay any claims.
   De Maiziere subsequently wrote the president of the World Jewish
Congress, Edgar Bronfman, saying he hoped for ``a settlement of the
Jewish claims ... within the framework of our possibilities.''
   West Germany has paid more than $40 billion in reparations to
Israel under a 1952 agreement with the Conference on Jewish
Material Claims.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new right-wing
governing coalition faced a Parliament vote of approval today that
could end three months of political uncertainty.
   Before the vote, Shamir met with leaders of his Likud bloc to
map out strategy for warding off threats of last minute defections
by three disgruntled legislators.
   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the PLO-backed
leaders of the 2{-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
rule called the new coalition a ``terrorist government'' and urged
an escalation of the revolt.
   Likud's 2-year-old governing coalition with the center-left
Labor Party led by Shimon Peres fell in a Parliament vote of
confidence March 15. The collapse came after Likud refused Labor
demands that Israel accept a U.S. proposal for opening peace talks
with Palestinians.
   Israeli newspapers reported that Shamir appeared likely to
override defection threats and pull through with a majority of 62
in the 120-member legislature, which must approve a government
before it takes power.
   ``As I see the situation now, there is no problem,'' said Arab
Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert of Likud, the chief negotiator in
bringing together the coalition.
   Likud signed the agreement with 9 parties and splinter factions
on Friday.
   One threat of defection came from Shas, a key five-member
ultra-Orthodox faction that demanded police cancel an investigation
announced Sunday into suspicions of fraud against its leader,
Interior Minister Aryeh Deri.
   Three other legislators inside Likud also suggested they would
abstain from the vote after failing to win Cabinet appointments. A
fourth legislator indicated Sunday he also might abstain but later
changed his position.
   Israeli newspapers said that if Shamir is not assured of
victory, the party would bow out of a vote today and call for early
national elections, now scheduled for 1992.
   In April, a coalition put together by Peres fell apart several
hours before Parliament was to vote.
   A victory for the right-wing coalition in Parliament would be
the fourth time that the Polish-born Shamir, 74, would be sworn in
as premier. The first was in September 1983 when he took over from
Menachem Begin, who stepped down.
   The new government is slated to have 19 ministers and at least
six deputy ministers in a coalition comprised of 10 parties and
splinter factions.
   Its policy guidelines call for taking tougher measures to crush
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands and beef up the army
against war threats from Iraq.
   They also call for peace efforts with neighboring Arab
countries, but at the same time urge more Jewish settlement
building in the West Bank and Gaza.
   The guidelines declare that Arabs in annexed east Jerusalem can
not take part in proposed elections for 1.7 million Palestinians in
the territories.
   Also included are controversial promises to ultra-Orthodox
partners, among them restrictions on public-funded abortions,
banning the sale of pork and forcing more businesses to shut on the
Jewish Sabbath.
   Among the coalition's supporters is a radical two-member faction
that calls for expelling Palestinians from disputed lands as a
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Peres said on Israel television that the new Cabinet would be
``the most radical government'' in Israel's history.
   ``This narrow, extremist government will not allow for any
process of peace,'' he said, warning the new Cabinet would likely
run a collision course with the United States over peace moves.
   In a leaflet, entitled ``a call of defiance against the racist
government,'' uprising leaders in the West Bank and Gaza urged
attacks on both the army and Jewish settlers.

   A woman panicked and fell to her death from
a horizontal lift bridge when it began to rise as she walked across
it, police said.
   The 50-year-old woman was either leaning over or trying to jump
from the rising bridge and fell several feet before she was caught
in part of the bridge's superstructure Sunday, authorities said.
   ``She screamed, `Help me! Somebody help me, please!''' said
Noelle Nelson, who watched helplessly from the deck of a nearby
restaurant. ``She must've thought the bridge was going to dump
her.''
   The woman was walking on the bridge when a bell sounded,
signaling the bridge was about to go up. The bridge had risen 30 to
40 feet when the women fell, witnesses said.
   Authorities withheld the woman's identity while relatives are
notified.
   Police and the Public Works Department, which operates the
510-foot Aerial Lift Bridge over the Duluth Ship Canal, were
investigating the accident.
   Four cameras on the bridge help the bridge operator see if
anyone is on the bridge before it is raised. Public Works Director
Richard Larson said he didn't know whether the operator saw the
woman on the television monitors.
   Unlike a drawbridge, the bridge rises horizontally, reaching a
height of 135 feet in 55 seconds.

   An explosion ripped through a bank in this
desert community early today, engulfing the building in flames. It
was the third such blast in the region in five weeks.
   Firefighters were still battling the blaze several hours after
the 3:15 a.m. blast at the Security Pacific branch, police said. No
injuries had been reported.
   ``The whole structure is involved,'' said Tammy Tino, an Indio
Police Department dispatcher.
   Today's blast was the third unexplained explosion at a Southern
California desert bank since early May, police said. Tino said it
was unknown if the three explosions were related.
   On May 7, a small fire erupted after a pre-dawn blast at a Palm
Springs bank. The explosion sent the deposit box's door flying 500
feet away and damaged the bank wall. Damage was estimated at
$100,000 and bills were strewn around the bank parking lot.
   In the early morning hours of May 21, a night deposit box was
bombed in nearby Rancho Mirage, causing major damage to Provident
Federal Savings Bank, authorities said.
   After today's blast, police and firefighters shut down Highway
111 between Clinton and Grenada, about 130 miles southeast of Los
Angeles, police said. It was not immediately known when the road
would be reopened.

<HEAD>Family Awaits Word of Kidnapped American Miner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of an American miner kidnapped
by South American guerrillas spent the weekend visiting their
neighbors who helped raise the $60,000 ransom demanded for their
son's release.
   ``We didn't get a whole lot of rest,'' said Roy Heimdal. ``But
there are some God-awful nice people here.''
   Scott Heimdal, 27, was taken hostage during an April 28 ambush
in an Ecuador jungle that left one man dead and another seriously
injured.
   Heimdal's family raised the ransom money through a public
appeal. Taverns and banks took up collections, and children sold
lemonade to raise money.
   His parents wired the $60,000 to a bank in Quito, Ecuador, just
before a noon Friday deadline. The money was to be delivered
through an intermediary.
   If all goes well, Heimdal will be released by Wednesday night,
said his mother, Marge Heimdal. Heimdal said he and his wife plan
to fly to South America as soon as they know their son has been
freed.
   Jeff Fino, who oversees the mine's operations in Ecuador, said
he expects the guerrillas, members of the Popular Liberation Army,
to honor their word and return Heimdal after receiving the $60,000
ransom.
   ``These are people who are committed to their word,'' Fino said
in a telephone interview with the Peoria Journal Star. ``To these
people, kidnapping is a business, not a crime. They are people you
might relate to the back hills in the U.S. Their word is gospel.''
   Fino said the demand for ransom, though harshly worded, never
states that Heimdal will be killed if the money is not raised. Mrs.
Heimdal said the kidnappers have threatened to ``show us where his
body is'' if the money is not delivered.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Wins More Than 99 Percent Of Seats In Boycotted Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party won all but 34 of more
than 3,700 seats in municipal councils in nationwide elections
boycotted by opposition parties, the government said today.
   Because only a few independent candidates challenged the
Constitutional Democratic Rally party in Sunday's elections, voters
abstained to express discontent with the government of President
Zine el Abidine Ben Ali.
   Municipal and regional elections were scheduled Tuesday in
neighboring Algeria in the first multi-party challenge to the
ruling National Salvation Front.
   In Tunisia, no official voter turnout figure had been released
by this afternoon, but newspapers said about 85 percent of the
country's 1.7 million voters cast ballots. The turnout reportedly
was higher in rural areas and lower in Tunis, the capital.
   Independent candidates ignoring the boycott were listed on
ballots in only 19 of 246 municipal councils.
   According to preliminary results issued by the Interior
Ministry, independents won 34 seats, including 12 in Monastir,
birthplace of former President Habib Bourguiba.
   After ruling the country since 1957, Bourguiba was ousted from
power Nov. 7, 1987 by Ben Ali, who was his prime minister. Ben Ali
had said the octogenarian president had become senile and
physically unfit to hold office. Two Tunis newspapers reported
today that independent candidates had accused supporters of the
ruling party of various electoral abuses in some regions.
   The election boycott was endorsed by officially recognized
left-and right-wing secular parties and by an officially
unrecognized Islamic fundamentalist group, An-Nahda.
   The government has withheld recognition to An-Nahda on grounds
that God belongs to all Tunisians.
   The balloting marked the second time the voters of the North
African country of 7.2 million people were ostensibly posed with a
free choice.
   In legislative elections in 1988, the ruling party won every
seat in the national assembly. Opposition parties later accused the
party of having abused its control of state funds, transport and
mass media.

   A railroad car in a coal mine derailed and

   The shuttle car was carrying 12 miners from a work area to the

Bethlehem Steel Corp. spokesman Art Roth.
   Five employees remained hospitalized this morning, Roth said.
Three were treated and released after Sunday night's accident, he

   About 1,000 people work at the mine 90 miles east of Pittsburgh.
   Donald J. Smith, 46, of Gallitzin, a mechanic at the mine for 16
years, was dead when taken to Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital,
according to a nursing supervisor.
   Federal, state and company officials were investigating the

   A British Airways pilot sucked out of his
jetliner's cockpit when a front windshield blew out was held by his
legs for a quarter of an hour while his copilot made an emergency
landing in southern England.
   ``The window popped and Tim went out like a rag doll,'' said
stewardess Susan Prince, who helped hold onto 41-year-old Capt. Tim
Lancaster after the ordeal aboard the BAC-111 aircraft began Sunday
at 23,000 feet.
   Crewmembers said when the windshield blew out Lancaster had his
single lap belt fastened but not his shoulder harness, which he had
unfastened during the ascent.
   Lancaster today was suffering from shock, a fractured elbow,
wrist and thumb, as well as frostbite in one hand. A British
Airways spokesman said today he was in satisfactory condition in
Southampton Hospital, was able to sit up in bed and visit with his
wife, Margaret.
   ``I have spoken to him and he is bright and cheerful,'' said
hospital site services manager John Walker.
   The airline said the windshield on the British-made plane was a
new one, just put in Friday. Investigations by British Airways and
the Civil Aviation Authority centered on the windshield's
installation.
   The plane, with a crew of six and 81 passengers, had been
airborne for 20 minutes when the accident occurred. It was bound
for the resort of Malaga, Spain, from Birmingham in northern
England.
   When the windshield panel blew out and the drop in air pressure
began to suck Lancaster out, purser Nigel Ogden was nearby in the
forward galley, serving tea. He dashed into the cockpit and, as the
pilot was disappearing, grabbed his legs.
   Simon Rogers, a steward, strapped himself into the pilot's seat
harness and, helped by Miss Prince, held on to Lancaster as Ogden
let go. Blood was pouring from a gash in Ogden's right arm caused
by broken glass.
   Rogers held the pilot for 15 minutes while other crewmembers
calmed passengers and gave Ogden first aid.
   Ogden and Rogers were treated at Southampton Hospital for cuts,
and four passengers were admitted with shock. All were later
released.
   A British Airways spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom, said today all the airline's BAC-111s had been
inspected following the accident and found to be safe.
   The pilot was so far out of the left windshield _ the cockpit
has two front windshields _ that when the BAC 1-11 twin-engine jet
eventually landed at Southampton Airport firefighters were able to
lift him out through it.
   Lancaster was nearly naked. His uniform had been torn off and he
was bleeding from being repeatedly slammed against the nose cone.
   Copilot Alistair Atcheson, with Lancaster hanging outside as
winds at minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit blew into the plane, had
donned an oxygen mask and put the jet into a steep dive to get
below 10,000 feet where pressure drops to normal. He landed the
aircraft at Southampton, 70 miles southwest of London.
   Color photographs of the airliner in today's newspapers showed
red flecks above a window in the cockpit where the wind had
spattered Lancaster's blood.
   Passengers in front seats said they saw the pilot hanging from
the window as the crew struggled to save him and bring the aircraft
down safely.
   ``There was a terrific bang and a rush of air so strong it
seemed to part my hair,'' said passenger David Duncan, 35, a
construction worker. ``The cockpit door was blown off its hinges
and I saw the near-naked pilot hanging out of the window covered in
blood.''
   Another passenger, Chris Opie, said the plane began a rapid
descent and the crew warned passengers over the loudspeaker to
prepare for an emergency landing.
   ``I thought we were going to crash and began praying,'' said
Opie, who was traveling with his girlfriend and 19-month-old son.
``My girlfriend ... was crying and hugging our son.''
   Thames Valley police said the windshield panel, 3 feet wide by
2{ feet high, was found intact on a farm near Wallingford, 55 miles
west of London.
   All the passengers except seven continued to Malaga on another
plane sent to Southampton.

   One out of every six jobs created through the
year 2000 will be located in California, according to a forecast
published today by the Commerce Department.
   California also will retain its rank as the most populous state,
the projection by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis
said, and will continue to have the highest total personal income.
   California is projected to gain 3.4 million of the 18.9 million
new jobs created nationally between 1988 and 2000. Its population
will total 33.2 million.
   California and three other states _ Florida, New York and Texas
_ are projected to account for one-third of the nation's $4.1
trillion total personal income.
   Personal income in California will the highest in the nation at
$568 billion. Incomes will total $330 billion in New York, $250
billion in Texas and $226 billion in Florida.
   But Arizona and Nevada will post the fastest growth rates in
total personal income, jobs and population, while Connecticut will
continue to have the highest per capita income at $20,503.
   Total personal income is projected to grow 46.2 percent in
Nevada, well above the projected national income of 26.2 percent.
Arizona income will increase by 40.6 percent.
   The number of jobs will increase 31.5 percent in Nevada and 26.7
percent in Arizona, compared to 14.3 percent nationally.
   Population in Nevada will jump 29.8 percent, followed by Arizona
and Florida, 21.4 percent and 18.2 percent respectively. The
national population is expected to grow 8.9 percent.
   ``The projected growth in Nevada and Arizona reflects rapid
population growth and strength in their economies, in part due to
the continued shift in economic activity toward the Sun Belt,'' the
study said. ``Florida, Utah, California and Hawaii also are
projected to show rapid growth.''
   Populations will increase in every state except Wyoming,
Louisiana and West Virginia, which will post declines of 1.0
percent, 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.

   A dark plume of smoke gushed from the
burning supertanker as fireboats poured water over the decks of the
crippled Mega Borg.
   Then powerful explosions sent flaming debris rocketing into the
sky like Roman candles. The blast sent the sea ablaze with burning
crude.
   The tanker's rear deck dropped to just 5 feet above surface, 58
feet lower than when the first explosion and fire crippled the ship
early Saturday in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship, apparently at
anchor, listed slightly.
   The rear one-fifth of the ship was engulfed in flames. The
fire's intensity had buckled the castlelike structure's steel walls
and partially collapsed the ship's stack.
   On the water's surface, pools of brown oil burned.
   An assault using fire-extinguishing foam and water from
high-pressure hoses was scheduled for today in an attempt to keep
the Mega Borg afloat.
   The tanker carried 38 million gallons of light crude 57 miles
southeast of Galveston. An estimated 10,000 to 100,000 gallons
spilled already, creating a slick about one mile long north of the
vessel and another about 20 miles long to the south.
   Two fireboats sprayed water on the Mega Borg's deck to keep the
ship cool, and four Coast Guard cutters surrounded the supertanker.
   From a helicopter, the tattered remains of the ship's flag, were
visible on the rear of the tanker Saturday. They were lost in the
smoke and flames Sunday.

   Mayor Marion Barry is expected to announce he
will not seek re-election in an effort to reopen plea-bargain talks
with prosecutors trying him on cocaine and perjury charges, sources
close to Barry say.
   `He knows that his re-election plans represent one of his best
bargaining chips,'' one source familiar with Barry's thinking said
Sunday. ``This is a move he hopes will break the logjam around the
plea talks.''
   The timing of the expected announcement was uncertain, but it
could come as early as today.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug
use.
   Barry met with top campaign officials and fund-raisers late
Sunday to discuss his political situation, but details of the
private session were not available immediately.
   One source had said going into the session that it was expected
the mayor ``will tell us that we're out of work.''
   Amid the maneuvering, jury selection in U.S. District Court
entered its second week today. Some 90 of 250 potential jurors were
screened last week, but efforts were being made to speed the
process so that a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates could be
seated by next Monday.
   The jurors questioned this morning included a man who said ``an
impression of sleaze has rubbed off on everyone'' in connection
with the Barry case.
   The man said he thought Barry had associated with ``unsavory
characters.''
   The plea discussions, which started more than two weeks ago,
broke down last week with U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens insisting
that Barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor only
willing to consider a misdemeanor plea.
   A guilty plea to any of the perjury charges probably would
result in Barry drawing a prison term under federal sentencing
guidelines. In that event, he could not continue to hold office or
run for re-election to a fourth four-year term.
   By taking himself out of the mayor's race, Barry hopes to
persuade Stephens to relax his demands for a felony plea, said the
sources, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Right now, he feels this is the best he can get,'' one source
said. ``It guarantees him nothing, but there is a hope that if he
isn't running again, Stephens might reconsider his stance.''
   The sources said Barry has agonized over the decision to abandon
hopes of retaining the job he has held since 1979.
   ``Anything is possible,'' one source said. ``He's getting a lot
of pressure from his supporters not to do this, and right now, he's
waking up every morning and deciding what he wants to do.
Sometimes, it is different from one day to the next.''
   Efforts to reach Barry and his spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, by
telephone Sunday were unsuccessful.
   Barry had been set to announce last Friday that he is bowing out
of contention for the mayor's chair, sources said, but instead said
through Rackley that he had made no decision about his political
future.
   Several sources said the mayor postponed his announcement
because he was angry that congressional Del. Walter Fauntroy, now a
mayoral candidate, said he was playing an active role in contacting
members of Congress to encourage the White House to put pressure on
Stephens to seek a plea agreement.
   Fauntroy later played down those discussions, and an
unidentified member of the Congressional Black Caucus told The New
York Times that Fauntroy had done none of the mediating that he had
claimed.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who has met several times
with Barry, has said publicly that he urged the mayor to end his
campaign and seek a plea bargain to spare the city the pain of a
drawn-out trial.
   Barry's top political aide, Anita Bonds, told The Washington
Post that the mayor's supporters were ``furious'' with Fauntroy for
injecting himself into the case and that some backers are ``mad at
Jesse too.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Agrees to Meet Baltic Presidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed for the
first time to meet with the presidents of the three Baltic
republics to discuss their campaigns for independence, spokesmen
said today.
   The Kremlin chief was scheduled to sit down with the Baltic
leaders on Tuesday after a meeting of the Federation Council, a new
presidential advisory body, according to Paul Raudseps, spokesman
for Latvia's parliament, and Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for
Lithuania's parliament.
   The two spoke by telephone from Riga, the Lativan capital, and
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, respectively.
   It will be the first time Gorbachev has met jointly with the
presidents of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. It could signal a new
Kremlin diplomatic initiative to try to break the stalemate over
the three republics' independence campaigns.
   The three presidents formed a united front last month to press
their drives to restore the independence they lost in 1940 and
asked at the time for a meeting with Gorbachev.
   Ms. Dapkus said the Kremlin finally agreed to the session but
she did not know how or when.
   Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Arnold Ruutel of Estonia and
Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia met today to prepare for the Kremlin
session, Raudseps and Ms. Dapkus said. No details of their meeting
in the Lithuanian town of Panevezys were available, the spokesmen
said.
   In Moscow, Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene,
hoped to meet tonight with Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov,
Lithuanian officials reported.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass, in an unusual preview of
the meeting, said Mrs. Prunskiene arrived in Moscow today
accompanied by Algirdas Brazauskas, a deputy Lithuanian prime
minister.
   Brazauskas said the main topic of discussion was the economic
blockade the Kremlin imposed in April to pressure Lithuania into
backing off its Feb. 11 declaration of independence.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused today to limit the
power of a federal judge's appointees to supervise elections and
other activities of the Teamsters union.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that lower
courts were unlawfully enforcing orders aimed at ridding the union
of corruption and ties to organized crime.
   The case stems from the federal government's 1988 lawsuit
accusing the Teamsters of violating the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act.
   The union agreed on the eve of a trial to settle the suit under
a consent decree approved by U.S. District Judge David Edelstein in
New York City.
   The judge appointed three officials to discipline corrupt union
leaders, to help run the union and to supervise its future
elections.
   The union then challenged the power of one appointee to monitor
local balloting leading up to next year's election of international
Teamsters officers.
   The Teamsters also said Edelstein violated members' free-speech
rights by ordering the union to distribute monthly reports issued
by the court-appointed administrator.
   The judge said the union could comply either by continuing
monthly publication of its magazine, the International Teamster, or
by mailing the administrator's report separately.
   The order was prompted by the union's decision to scale back the
magazine, publishing it quarterly rather than monthly.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, without holding a
hearing, rejected the union's appeal of Edelstein's orders.
   In the appeal acted on today, union lawyers said the appeals
court illegally refused to review Edelstein's orders.
   The case is Teamsters vs. U.S., 89-1602.

   The Supreme Court today let stand the
mail-fraud and tax-evasion convictions of fringe presidential
candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. and six associates.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that the seven
were denied a fair trial.
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year prison sentence in Rochester, Minn.
   He and the others were convicted in federal court in Alexandria,
Va., in late 1988 of participating in a criminal conspiracy
involving more than $30 million in defaulted loans.
   Prosecutors said fund-raisers for LaRouche organizations based
in Leesburg, Va., took loans from potential contributors even
though LaRouche had no intention of repaying the lenders. The
prosecutors also said he avoided taxes by reporting no income and
having his living expenses paid through corporations he controlled.
   Also convicted were William Wertz, Edward Spannaus, Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.
Wertz and Spannaus each was sentenced to five years in prison and
fined $1,000. The other four defendants were sentenced to three
years and ordered to pay fines.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for LaRouche and the
others argued that the defendants were denied adequate time to
prepare for trial, and that the trial's jury selection was
conducted unfairly.
   The appeal also contended that the trial judge wrongly curtailed
the defendant's right to present their case.
   ``The trial court's consistent desire to elevate speed and
docket control over the rights of criminal defendants meant it
equated critical defense evidence with mere diversions whenever
such evidence threatened to slow down the rapid pace of trial,''
the appeal said.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those arguments
and upheld the seven convictions last Jan. 22.
   The case is LaRouche vs. U.S., 89-1785.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Federal Law Outlining Burning of Flag</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Bush quotes and other
cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today struck down a new
federal law that outlaws burning the American flag. ``Punishing
desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this
emblem so revered,'' the court said.
   In other rulings, the court gave police broad new authority to
stop and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip, and
ruled that the federal government may order state National Guard
troops to participate in peacetime training abroad without a
governor's consent.
   The court's 5-4 decision in the flag case indicated the
divisiveness of the emotional issue. The ruling is certain to touch
off a political battle in Congress to pass a constitutional
amendment protecting the flag from desecration.
   In a split identical to a ruling last year on the flag-burning
issue, the justices said the Flag Protection Act of 1989 violates
freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment to the
Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice William J. Brennan
called it a ``bedrock'' constitutional guarantee.
   President Bush said he would intensify his efforts to win
approval of a constitutional amendment banning flag-burning. ``Some
of us said ahead of time that the legislative approach would not be
upheld. Apparently, the court decided that,'' he said.
   Speaking to reporters after a Rose Garden ceremony honoring
drug-free schools, Bush said that he would ``continue to press for
what I strongly believe is in the public interest.''
   Congressional leaders had said if the law were declared invalid
they would move quickly for votes in the House and Senate on a
constitutional amendment to protect Old Glory from burning or
desecration.
   That move is expected to inject the issue into this fall's
congressional and state legislative campaigns.
   A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds
of the members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38
state legislatures. The First Amendment never has been altered in
199 years.
   ``We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive
to many,'' Brennan wrote.
   But, quoting from the court's earlier ruling, he said, ``If
there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable.''
   Brennan noted that the government has said there is a national
consensus in favor of banning flag burning. ``Even assuming such a
consensus exists, any suggestion that the government's interest in
suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to
that speech grows is foreign to the First Amendment,'' he said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said the
government has a legitimate interest in banning flag burning.
   ``The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality
and tolerance _ ideas that Americans have passionately defended and
debated throughout our history,'' he said. ``The flag embodies the
spirit of our national commitment to those ideals.''
   In the 1989 case, the court struck down a Texas law banning flag
burning. It was that year-old opinion that prompted Congress to
approve the federal law declared unconstitutional today.
   Supporters of the federal legislation said it is different from
the Texas law because the federal act does not single out flag
burning as a means of expression.
   The federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag for
any purpose _ except to destroy a soiled or worn flag.
   David Cole, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional
Rights and co-counsel for defendants in the case, said, ``We are
overjoyed. The court has essentially said that the First Amendment
means what it says. And that is that the government cannot
incarcerate its citizens for engaging in political expression that
the government doesn't like.
   The Bush administration, with some reluctance, joined in
defending the federal law.
   President Bush and leading Republicans said they would prefer a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, and Bush allowed the
legislation to become law without his signature.
   ``I remain convinced ... that a constitutional amendment is the
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration,''
Bush said then.
   In the 6-3 police ruling, the justices said anonymous tips can
justify stopping and questioning someone if the information is in
some way corroborated before such action is taken.
   In the National Guard case that revived a controversy from the
1988 presidential campaign, the justices unanimously upheld a 1986
federal law challenged by Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota.
   The law was challenged previously by Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, the defeated 1988 Democratic presidential candidate
who opposed sending National Guard troops to train in Central
America.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Refused to let a private Jewish group display a menorah in a
public park near the Burlington, Vt., City Hall.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a rulilng that barred
city officials last December from granting permission for the
menorah's display.
   _ Agreed to hear a Bush administration appeal aimed at heading
off all lawsuits against government employees accused of causing
personal injury.
   The court said it will consider killing a Texas family's medical
malpractice suit against an Army doctor.
   _ Agreed to review a dispute over the power of federal
prosecutors to force distributors of adult books and films to turn
over such material and business records to the government.
   The court said it will review a ruling that a New York City
company must turn over business records _ but not193 videotapes _
to a prosecutor in Virginia.
   The prime sponsors of the flag-burning law were Democrats, who
learned a bitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign in
which Bush exploited patriotic values in defeating Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   The law made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison for
anyone who burns, mutilates, defaces, tramples the flag or
``maintains (it) on the floor or ground.''
   The latter phrase was prompted by a controversial Chicago art
exhibit last year in which viewers were invited to stand on an
American flag and write comments about the display in a ledger.
   Today's cases reached the court after federal judges in the
District of Columbia and Seattle said the federal law violates
First Amendment rights. The law was challenged by demonstrators who
burned American flags in the two cities.
   Brennan read for six minutes from his opinion in the hushed and
crowded courtroom.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Stevens was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Byron
R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The cases are U.S. vs. Eichman, 89-1433, and U.S. vs. Haggerty,
89-1434.

<HEAD>Most Contras Demobilize by Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 11,000 Contra fighters met
last weekend's demobilization deadline and the remaining 3,000 are
expected to do so within a few days, U.N. sources said today.
   The demobilization process began May 7 and was to have been
completed by Sunday. But it was interrupted twice by the Contras _
once by concern over the stability of the government of President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and once over a false report of a
massacre of unarmed Contras.
   Mrs. Chamorro's government took over in April following a decade
of rule by the leftist Sandinistas, whom the U.S.-backed Contras
had sought to topple.
   Fernando Castenon of the United Nations' Managua office said as
of Sunday night, 11,228 Contras had turned in their weapons.
   The government agreed to create more than 20 development centers
in war zones and invested $47 million in U.S. aid in economic and
social infrastructure.
   But some Contras said over the weekend they would rather go home
than go to the development centers.
   ``Very few of us are going to go to the center because we prefer
to see our people, whom we have gone years without seeing,'' said
Filemon Cruz Lopez, 18, who said he joined the Contras when he was
10.
   ``We want to know what happened to our homes,'' he said.
   He was among about 800 Contras who turned in weapons Saturday in
El Almendro, a U.N.-policed security zone set up for demobilization
purposes 115 miles southeast of Managua in Rio San Juan province.
   Officials of the peacekeeping forces said it could take 10 days
for the rest of the Contras to disarm and be processed.
   ``Only 10 percent of the demobilized and disarmed rebels here
have said they want to go to the development (areas),'' said Daniel
Lozano, chief of operations of the U.N. International Verification
and Support Commission. ``The rest prefer that we take them home.''
   Manuel Garay, 36, a farmer from Plan de Grama in northern
Nicaragua's Jinotega province, said he has no land but still
prefers home to the development centers.
   ``I haven't done anything bad to anyone from my place. I don't
owe anyone anything there. I believe I can return and go back to my
work,'' he said.

<HEAD>High Court Makes Penalties Against Lawyers Easier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
federal judges to penalize lawyers who file lawsuits determined to
be improper or frivolous.
   The court, voting 8-1, ruled against Cooter &amp; Gell, a
Washington, D.C., law firm penalized $21,402 for filing an
antitrust suit based on research deemed inadequate.
   The justices said a judge had authority to impose the fine even
though the law firm agreed to drop the suit.
   Cooter &amp; Gell represented Dash's Designer, a now bankrupt
discount men's clothing store.
   Dash's filed an antitrust suit against Hartmarx Corp.,
manufacturers and distributors of Hickey-Freeman and Hart,
Schaffner &amp; Marx men's clothing.
   Dash's said Hartmarx illegally sold the brands exclusively to
only one retailer in each of various major cities nationwide.
   Cooter &amp; Gell relied in part on research by a secretary at the
law firm who telephoned some retailers in Washington and three
other cities to determine whether Hartmarx had such an exclusivity
policy.
   Hartmarx later asked for dismissal of the Cooter &amp; Gell suit
after submitting affidavits that showed it distributed to as many
as 20 different retailers in some markets.
   The law firm agreed to drop the suit.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the $21,402
penalty against Cooter &amp; Gell last year. The appeals court invoked
a rule against frivolous suits, noting that Cooter &amp; Gell's claims
were not supported by the skimpy research it performed.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the high court today,
said the law firm's withdrawal of the suit did not divest the
federal courts of power to impose such sanctions.
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented. He said the ruling
undermines another rule encouraging the withdrawal of groundless
suits.
   The high court today overturned part of the appeals court ruling
that would have cost Cooter &amp; Gell more money. O'Connor said
Hartmarx is not entitled to be reimbursed for legal fees it
incurred in fighting appeals brought by Cooter &amp; Gell.
   The case is Cooter &amp; Gell vs. Hartmarx, 89-275.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former provincial governor serving
a life term for murder led an attempted jail break Monday, and five
prisoners were killed in a shootout with guards, authorities said.
   Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said the inmates had two
homemade pistols, and another prisoner and three guards were
wounded during the gun battle at the National Penitentiary in
suburban Muntinglupa.
   Drilon said prisoners in cell No. 7, including former Nueva
Vizcaya Gov. Orlando Dulay, were involved in the attempted break.
   Dulay is serving a life term for killing three campaign workers
of President Corazon Aquino before the February 1986 presidential
elections. Dulay, a staunch supporter of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, was moved to an isolation cell, Drilon said.
   He said the injured prisoner told authorities ``Dulay was the
mastermind.'' Drilon did not elaborate.
   ``Inmates started firing and throwing Molotov bombs and the
guards returned fire,'' he said.
   He said he ordered an investigation into how the prisoners were
able to obtain two homemade .38-caliber pistols used in the
attempted escape.

   Four people died when their small
Yugoslav plane crashed during a storm near Sarajevo, in central
Yugoslavia, the state Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
   The cr~f Detroit.
   The story also said doctors over the weekend performed an
abdominal biopsy on Miss Taylor that detected no sign of infection.
   The source for the Associated Press story was a woman who gave
her name as Lisa Flowers and who was reached through the answering
service at Miss Taylor's public relations firm Chen Sam and
Associates in New York City.
   The story also quoted a woman who identified herself as Chen Sam
as confirming the report, saying ``It's a very romantic story.''
   But today Ms. Sam said from her New York office that the whole
report was a fabrication.
   ``This isn't true. It is a hoax,'' Ms. Sam said this morning.
``I have contacted Miss Taylor's attorneys and we are going to
conduct an investigation.
   ``It is apparently somebody using my (telephone) service. This
woman is impersonating me.''
   The hoaxer also confirmed the information for United Press
International, which also gave the story wide distribution.
   ``We're still trying to unthread it now,'' said Bob Martin,
UPI's bureau chief in Los Angeles. ``We had trouble getting hold of
Chen Sam and now it turns out we didn't get ahold of her after
all.''
   The AP office in Los Angeles had placed calls to the hospital
and Miss Taylor's publicist after receiving a message Sunday from
an AP affiliate in England, the Press Association, whose editors
had heard Miss Taylor had undergone another operation and wanted a
story.
   A call was placed to the hospital for spokeswoman Paulette Weir,
but she was unavailable on Sunday.
   Since most of Miss Taylor's publicity is handled by Chen Sam and
Associates of New York, an AP reporter in Los Angeles left a
message with the agency's answering service.
   A short time later, a woman returned the call, saying she was
Lisa Flowers from Chen Sam and Associates. The woman then gave the
reporter the bogus information about Miss Taylor's romantic
involvement.
   The reporter later placed a second call to Ms. Sam's answering
service, leaving a message for Lisa Flowers as a way of checking
her authenticity. The message for her was accepted without question
by the answering service operator.
   Ms. Sam said today that Miss Taylor was still recuperating at
St. John's Hospital and Health Center in a nine-week battle with
pneumonia and complications. She said the actress did not have any
weekend surgery.
   ``I was out there last week,'' Ms. Sam said. ``She's looking
wonderful and doing much better. She should be there two more
weeks.''

   A story that said Elizabeth Taylor was
romantically involved with a 23-year-old man and had undegone
surgery over the weekend was a hoax, the star's publicist said
today.
   The hoaxer used an elaborate scheme including a public relations
firm's answering service to trick the news media into the phony
story about Miss Taylor, who has been hospitalized for two months.
   The story said Miss Taylor was expected to be released from the
hospital within two weeks and would leave on the arm of her
23-year-old boyfriend Julian Lee Hobbs of Lake Orion, a suburb of
Detroit.
   The story also said doctors over the weekend performed an
abdominal biopsy on Miss Taylor that detected no sign of infection.
   The source for the Associated Press story was a woman who gave
her name as Lisa Flowers and who was reached through the answering

all countries.
   When Cameroon played Peru in the 1982 World Cup, he said: ``It
was our sorcerers against their sorcerers.''
   But Tsala Mbala said the players have proven their ability in
tying Peru, Poland and eventual champion Italy eight years ago and
by last week's upset of Argentina.
   ``The players didn't need magic against Argentina,'' he said.
``They simply were stronger physically and emotionally.''

   Mary Blalock hopes to capitalize on
international real estate trends: The ``For Sale'' sign outside her

   She can't read it, but she wrote it, so Mrs. Blalock hopes she
copied the oriental characters correctly. It's supposed to say
``House for Sale.''
   ``I was hoping I wasn't putting something up offensive,'' she
said.
   She is asking $600,000 for the six-bedroom house on an 8{-acre
lot with two lakes, a cabin, a small barn and a five-dog kennel.
   It went up for sale last summer. Nobody was interested.
   So when Mrs. Blalock heard that Japanese investors were looking
at the nearby Country Club of Louisiana, she began looking for
someone who could write Japanese.
   ``We have an Asian student worker and he went off and found this
guy,'' she said. ``He wrote what I wanted to say out for me on a
little piece of paper and I copied it as best I could and hoped I'd
copied it right.''
   The new sign hasn't brought any nibbles, but she hasn't given up
hope.
   ``I haven't had any Japanese call, but hopefully if they do,
they'll speak English.''

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says Soviet Reforms Have ``Long Way to Go''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet arsenal of long-range nuclear
weapons remains a threat despite improved relations between the
United States and the Soviet Union, Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney said Monday.
   ``Perestroika has a long, long way to go,'' Cheney told the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the chief pro-Israeli
lobbying organization in the United States.
   Cheney described the recent summit meeting between President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as ``useful and
productive.''
   ``The relationship between the two superpowers clearly has been
moving toward a new footing,'' he said.
   However, he said, ``The threat of a Soviet land invasion in
Europe may have declined, but the Soviet strategic arsenal is still
a threat.''.
   Cheney also predicted that 15 countries are expected to be
producing ballistic missiles by the year 2000.
   He said the list included Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea. He said at least six of the 15 will have intermediate range
missiles by the turn of the century.
   The defense secretary said 23 countries have confirmed or
suspected chemical warfare programs and 10 have or may have
biological warfare programs.
   ``Iraq has been the source of some particularly disturbing news
in recent months,'' he said, noting its attempts to acquire
electronic trigger mechanisms suitable for nuclear weapons, a claim
to possess sophisticated chemical weapons and a recent televised
test for a first stage booster rocket.
   ``Baghdad television has claimed that Iraq has developed two
missiles with ranges of 2,000 kilometers,'' he said. ``Although we
do not believe that claim, it is a fact that Baghdad is now
producing missiles that can reach Israel.''
   In answer to questions after his speech, Cheney said:
   _He hopes to visit Israel ``in the very near future'' after a
new government is installed. He said he had planned a trip in May,
but put it off because of the political instability in the country.
   _Although ``the situation in Iraq has worsened,'' he would leave
it to the State Department to determine whether such steps as
economic sanctions would be justified.
   _As far as he knows Bush has not decided whether to break off or
suspend talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the
wake of the aborted May 30 attack on a Tel Aviv beach. He said the
United States was ``horrified'' by the attack and it is ``causing
us very seriously to review'' the dialogue with the PLO.

   A Japanese climber became the first
person to die on Mount McKinley this year after he was stranded
without a tent for two days at the 19,000-foot level, authorities
said.
   Rescuers believe they were within 200 feet of Hairoaki Ito when
he died Sunday.
   Ito and a companion had become separated from five other
climbers in their party, most of whom had reached the summit
Saturday, said Bob Seibert, chief mountaineering ranger for the
National Park Service.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, but Seibert said
the 38-year-old Ito was suffering from exposure and altitude
sickness.
   ``To be exposed to Denali weather at that elevation is just
asking for it,'' said Renny Jackson, a ranger who had descended
Saturday after spending 24 days on the mountain. Denali is the
native Alaskan name for McKinley.
   Ito died as his fellow climber was trying to reach him with an
air-dropped oxygen bottle and as a climbing party that included
physicians was scrambling up the mountain.
   Ito, from Hyogo, Japan, was the first to die on the mountain
since three British climbers were killed last fall. More than 40
people have died on Mount McKinley, the continent's tallest peak at
20,320 feet.

   A chartered plane arrived today carrying
about 350 U.S. citizens who fled war-torn Liberia, where rebels
were gaining ground in their fight to oust President Samuel K. Doe.
   The evacuees included at least 170 children, State Department
spokesman Jay Rini said.
   ``The streets are virtually deserted. It's a very tense
situation,'' Al Jackson of Atlanta said in the Ivory Coast while en
route from Liberia.
   The evacuees were urged by the U.S. government to leave the West
African nation because of warfare and on Sunday flew from Monrovia,
Liberia, to Abidjan, capital of neighboring Ivory Coast.
   They transferred to an American Trans Air chartered flight and
arrived at Charleston International Airport at 12:25 p.m. EDT,
airport officials said.
   Johnny Connelly, a 26-year-old missionary from Madison, Ga.,
left Liberia with his wife, Janice, and their 2-year-old son,
Josiah.
   ``We just thought it would be best to leave at this time while
we still had a chance,'' said Connelly, who has been teaching Bible
classes in public schools for two years. He also was interviewed in
the Ivory Coast before leeaving for the United States.
   ``We're tired, we're happy to be out, but we left a lot of
friends back there, so we're sorry for them,'' he said, adding that
he'd return with his family next month if the fighting eased.
   The evacuees were to meet later today with representatives of
the state Department of Social Services to see if they need
government assistance to get home, said agency spokeswoman Norma
Anderson.
   ``We're geared up to take care of people,'' said William
Knowles, the department's director. ``This is similar to what we
did after Grenada.''
   United States troops evacuated American medical students after
invading the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983, and the students
also were flown to Charleston.
   Knowles said his department would provide medical care as well
as some provisions for destitute evacuees. None of the evacuees is
from South Carolina, but most are from the Southeast, officials
said.
   Liberia, which in 1847 became the first independent nation in
Africa, was founded by former black American slaves in 1822.
   In Liberia today, government and rebel negotiators headed for
neighboring Sierra Leone for talks aimed at ending the civil war
that recently closed in on Monrovia, prompting people to evacuate
by the thousands.
   The 5{-month-old civil war aimed at ousting Doe has left more
than 1,000 dead.

   Defendants charged under a federal law banning
desecration of the American flag cheered the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision Monday to declare the law unconstitutional. ``People
won,'' one of them said.
   In a 5-4 decision, the court held the government cannot prohibit
burning of the flag ``simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.''
   ``I feel great,'' said Jennifer Campbell, 23, of Seattle, one of
four people charged with burning a flag outside a Seattle post
office shortly after the law went into effect Oct. 28.
   ``For all those people who told me protesting didn't do
anything, I've just proved them wrong. For once, the system may
have worked.''
   ``People won,'' said Carlos Garza, 33. ``That's what really
excites me. ... Time now that people start standing up and quit
allowing their government to tear down our rights.''
   Garza, Campbell, Darius ``Colin'' Strong and Mark Haggerty were
charged in the case, the first constitutional challenge to the law.
The case and charges stemming from a flag burning in Washington,
D.C., were combined in the government's appeal to the high court.
   The justices said the Flag Protection Act of 1989 violates
freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.
   Congressional leaders had said if the law were declared invalid
they would move quickly on a constitutional amendment to protect
the flag from burning or desecration.
   A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds
of the members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38
state legislatures. ``We are very happy that the court has stood up
for individual rights of expression against a Congress that sought
to incarcerate our clients simply for engaging in political
expression,'' said David Cole, a lawyer with the Center for
Constitutional Rights in New York who had represented the
defendants.
   Cole, Garza and Campbell all said they would protest any attempt
to pass a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag desecration.
   ``The battle has just begun,'' Garza said. ``We're not going to
allow them to put it in the Constitution _ tear it down for
something like this.''
   The Seattle defendants still face charges of destruction of
government property.
   The law made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison for
anyone who burns, mutilates, defaces, tramples the flag or
``maintains (it) on the floor or ground.''
   The latter phrase was prompted by a Chicago art exhibit last
year in which viewers were invited to stand on a flag and write
comments about the display in a ledger.
   The flag cases reached the court after federal judges in the
District of Columbia and Seattle said the federal law violates
First Amendment rights.

<HEAD>U.S. Drug Treatment Center To Help Chinese With Drug Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American drug rehabilitation center has agreed
to help the government tackle China's growing problem with drug
addiction, the head of the U.S. program said Monday.
   Monsignor William B. O'Brien said his New York-based Daytop
Village would collaborate in a drug treatment center in Kunming,
capital of Yunnan province in southwestern China.
   Yunnan borders Burma and Laos and has long been a favorite route
for heroin and opium smugglers from the so-called Golden Triangle,
the lawless border areas of those Southeast Asian nations and
Thailand.
   The Beijing government, which until recently denied the
existence of drug addiction in China, now acknowledges that
narcotics abuse is common in rural Yunnan and that 70 percent of
the province's crime is drug-related.
   The government also revealed late last year that 146
AIDS-infected intravenous drug users were discovered in a remote
village on Yunnan's border with Burma. Previously, only seven
Chinese nationals had been recognized as carriers of the AIDS virus.
   ``There's a real concern in the Yunnan province area,'' O'Brien
said. The Roman Catholic priest left for Kunming early Monday after
two days of talks with Ministry of Health officials.
   Under the agreement, Daytop Village will help set up a 30-bed
``therapeutic community,'' based on the organization's principles
that former addicts should help others kick the habit in a
drug-free, family, work-oriented environment.
   Daytop will finance construction of the center, train four
Chinese staff members in the United States and send one
Chinese-speaking expert to China. O'Brien said the American would
stay for up to three years, after which the Chinese would run the
operation.
   O'Brien said Daytop, which he helped found in 1963, has
collaborated in drug programs in 54 countries. He said the Chinese
approached him after an official toured a Daytop-backed drug center
in Thailand.
   China has set up two drug rehabilitation centers in Yunnan since
1988. A treatment center was opened in Beijing last year, mainly to
cure those addicted to prescription drugs.

<HEAD>Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline to Be Shut Down for Pump Station Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trans-Alaska oil pipeline will be
shut down for about 12 hours Tuesday to replace corroded lines at
several pump stations, officials said.
   The lines could begin leaking if left unrepaired, said Marnie
Isaacs, spokeswoman for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
   The affected steel pipes are not buried and are smaller than the
48-inch diameter line that links Prudhoe Bay with the marine
terminal at Valdez about 800 miles to the south, she said
   The corrosion apparently was caused by bacteria in water mixed
with the North Slope crude oil, she said. Sea water is injected
into oil fields to increase pressure, making it easier to recover
the oil.
   ``We've noticed it in numerous places, in several pump
stations,'' she said. There's a very, very small percentage of
water that's in the oil, and that starts a corrosion process.''
   The corrosion has occurred mostly at the northernmost pump
stations and is worst at Pump Station No. 1 at Prudhoe Bay, she
said.
   ``It's not a threat to the line right now, but internal
corrosion is a more rapid form of corrosion than we've seen along
the mainline pipe. It's something we do need to address,'' Ms.
Isaacs said. ``If left unrepaired, there would be a danger of
leakage.''
   Alyeska, which operates the pipeline for a consortium of seven
oil companies, has said it plans to spend some $800 million to
repair external corrosion on the main line during the next five
years. State officials have said that repair costs could top $1
billion.
   Alyeska will continue to receive about 20,000 barrels of oil per
hour during the shutdown, compared with the standard 73,000
barrel-per-hour-average. The oil will be held in two tanks that
have a combined capacity of about 350,000 barrels.
   Because of the shutdown, about 636,000 fewer barrels of oil will
flow through the line Tuesday than normal.

<TEXT>
   John M. Poindexter was sentenced today to six
months in prison for lying to Congress to conceal key details of
the Iran-Contra affair when he was President Reagan's national
security adviser.
   Poindexter showed no emotion as he stood before the judge for
sentencing, saying only, ``Your honor, I don't have any comment.''
He then became the first Iran-Contra defendant sentenced to prison.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene told the retired Navy
admiral that imprisonment was necessary to deter other public
officials from lying while conducting governmental business.
   Greene said that a sentence without incarceration ``would be
tantamount to a statement that to lie to and to obstruct Congress
was of no great moment.''
   ``Admiral Poindexter and his associates obstructed the Congress
_ nullifying the decisions that body had made'' by cutting off
direct military aid to Nicaraguan contras, Greene said.
   Greene did not impose a fine and said Poindexter could remain
free while he appealed the five felony convictions of making false
statements to Congress and obstructing the inquiries of lawmakers
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   But the judge made it clear that he felt that Poindexter's
crimes were serious, rejecting a defense argument that the retired
Navy officers's 33 years of service to the government should weigh
against incarceration.
   ``With all due respect ot the distinguished military records of
Admiral Poindexter'' and other Iran-Contra defendants, ``they had
no standing in a democratic society to ignore the decisions of
elected officials.''
   Greene noted that under federal sentencing guidelines, which do
not affect this case because they took effect after the Iran-Contra
affair, Poindexter would have been sentenced to 21 months to 27
months for the five felonies.
   But the judge said that he would not force Poindexter, 53, to
serve such a lengthy sentence while six other Iran-Contra
co-defendants had received terms of probation.
   He also noted that Poindexter ``conducted his defense in a
responsible but not a dishonest or disruptive manner,'' an apparent
reference to North's trial tactics two years ago.
   Without naming North, Greene said that ``unlike other
defendants, Poindexter did not take the stand to exculpate himself
by lying under oath.''
   The comment was an obvious reference to testimony by North, the
only Iran-Contra defendant to testify on his own behalf.
   Poindexter was convicted April 7 of conspiracy, two counts of
making false statements and two counts of obstructing congressional
inquiries.
   While Poindexter's lawyers argued that he had suffered enough
and should not be sent to prison, chief prosecutor Lawrence E.
Walsh argued that Poindexter's role as a top-ranking official was
different from those of the other Iran-Contra defendants, including
North.
   The judge said that after the Iran-Contra affair unraveled,
Poindexter and North ``engaged in the destruction of evidence _ one
step ahead of the Congress and two steps ahead of the attorney
general and the FBI.''
   Prosecutor Dan K. Webb told Greene that he had no doubt that
Poindexter was a decent, honorable man who had served his country
as a naval officer and adviser to Reagan, but Webb said that
Poindexter's crime was not an isolated incident.
   He called it ``a prolonged and protracted course of conduct to
obstruct Congress.''
   He said that the Iran-Contra affair ``is a classic example of
what happens when these laws are violated.''
   ``We literally had this admiral and one very misguided and
confused lieutenant colonel operating a private war in Nicaragua
and Congress didn't know about it,'' Webb said, referring to the
secret efforts to arm the Contras after Congress shut off aid.
   Defense lawyer Richard Beckler urged Greene to spare Poindexter
a prison term, citing his accomplishments as a career naval officer.
   Beckler said that when he served as Reagan's national security
adviser, ``I don't think anyone can appreciate the power and
pressure'' that bore on him.
   ``Every step can be a misstep. Clearly missteps were taken
here,'' Beckler said.
   But both Greene and the prosecutor noted that Poindexter had
shown no remorse or acceptance of his guilt while pleading for
leniency.
   Poindexter served as Reagan's national security adviser from
late 1985 until the revelations about the Iran-Contra affair forced
his resignation in November 1986.
   A jury found Poindexter guilty of making false statements to
Congress by denying in a letter that North and others were secretly
helping the Contras.
   He was also convicted of making false statements and altering or
destroying documents to conceal White House knowledge of an Israeli
shipment of Hawk antiaircraft missiles to Iran in 1985.
   Prosecutors contended that Poindexter denied that he knew
anything about the shipment until January 1986 to conceal a
politically embarrassing memo signed by Reagan that linked the
weapons sales to the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Subsequent ``intelligence findings'' signed by Reagan to
authorize other weapons sales said the purpose of the deals was to
establish contact with political moderates in Iran as well as seek
release of hostages.
   As details of U.S.-Iran arms shipments unfolded in the fall of
1986, Reagan denied that he ever engaged in a pure trade of arms
for hostages. He said the initiative also was undertaken to make
contact with political moderates in Iran.
   Also convicted of Iran-Contra crimes were arms dealers Albert
Hakim and Richard V. Secord, conservative fund-raisers Richard
Miller and the late Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell and former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane.

   The PLO today issued what appeared to be a
condemnation of an abortive guerrilla raid against Israel last
month, after the United States threatened to cut off dialogue with
the PLO over the incident.
   ``The PLO position remains unchanged. We are against any
military action that targets civilians, whatever form it may
take,'' said the statement by an unidentified PLO spokesman in
Baghdad and distributed by the PLO's official news agency WAFA.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization ``is still committed ...
to the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy and
Palestinian peace initiatives,'' the spokesman said.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat has disassociated the PLO from the
May 30 attack by a PLO faction on a Tel Aviv beach, but he has
fallen short of personally condemning it.
   In Washington, the State Department today said it was
disappointed that the PLO did not explicitly condemn the abortive
raid. But department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also said the
Bush administration has not yet decided whether to suspend the
18-month-old dialogue with Arafat's organization.
   ``We've never put a timeframe on it,'' the spokeswoman said at a
daily news briefing.
   WAFA reported that in Tunisia today, U.S. Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau met with PLO representative Hakam Balaoui in the capital
Tunis. The PLO news agency said the two discussed ``moves to
achieve peace in the Middle East'' but did not reveal whether the
latest PLO statement was discussed.
   Sixteen guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Front, one of the
nine factions under the PLO umbrella, launched the attack. Four of
the guerrillas were killed in the shootout with Israeli troops and
the rest were arrested. There were no casualties among the Israelis.
   ``We also condemn the Israeli crimes and massacres against our
workers and children that increase day by day,'' the PLO statement.
   The beach attack followed rioting that had raged in Israel and
Israeli-occupied territories since May 20, when an Israeli civilian
shot dead seven Arab laborers and wounded 11 near Tel Aviv.
   Today's announcement came after Sweden moved to prevent a
possible break in the talks between the United States and the PLO,
Arab diplomatic sources said in Baghdad.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sweden had
been trying to convince the PLO to respond to the U.S. demand that
the PLO condemn the foiled raid.
   President Bush said last week that he was considering breaking
off the dialogue after Arafat failed to condemn outright the attack
on the Israeli beach or fire the Palestine Liberation Front's
leader, Mohammed Abbas, from the PLO's ruling Executive Committee.
   Abbas, better known as Abul Abbas, was the mastermind of the
1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise liner in which a
wheelchair-bound American was shot and his body pushed overboard.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson sent an envoy, Mathias
Mossberg, to Baghdad at the weekend with a message to Arafat.
Mossberg met with Arafat three times since he arrived Saturday.
Andersson helped initiate the U.S.-PLO dialogue in December 1988.
   In December 1988, Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist, opening the way for the U.S.-Palestinian
dialogue to begin.
   Since then there have been regular meetings between PLO
officials and Pelletreau.
   Four U.S. senators last week urged a cutoff in the talks.

   The home of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals was renamed Monday for Elbert Parr Tuttle, the court's
oldest living judge.
   Tuttle, 92, was appointed to the federal bench by President
Eisenhower in 1954. He has been a part-time senior judge since 1968.
   ``What can anyone say under these circumstances?'' Tuttle said.
``No Court of Appeals judge does anything by himself. Nothing that
I did was any different from what was done by the majority of the
court sitting at that time.''
   He became a leader of the 5th Circuit when it served as the
legal battleground for the civil rights movement. The 11th Circuit
later split off from the 5th Circuit.
   The name change for the downtown courthouse was an exception to
the federal government's policy against naming public buildings
after living people.
   The courthouse is where police intercepted a December mail bomb
intended for the 11th Circuit.

   Here is the text of the Palestine
Liberation Organization statement released Monday, which was
telefaxed from Tunis, Tunisia, and translated from Arabic by The
Associated Press:
   The new Israeli government is a war Cabinet and a Cabinet of
oppression for our people. It is also a Cabinet for the
collaborators. The dangers posed by this government on Palestinian,
Arab and international levels is apparent in the program it has
announced.
   It is an extension of the previous governments which have
rejected all peace initiatives, for its head is none other than
(Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir who has rejected all the
international peace initiatives, including the 10-point Egyptian
proposal and the Baker plan, despite the fact the Palestine
Liberation Organization had responded postively and in a high
spirit of responsibility to these initiatives.
   The PLO is still committed to all its obligations declared in
Geneva in 1988 and to the peace process on the basis of
international legitimacy and Palestinian peace initiatives.
   Everybody knows that this is a government of warmongers and
extremists to prepare for a war against the Arab countries and
escalate aggression and expansion in the occupied territories.
   The recent Arab summit meeting made it clear that it rejects the
state of no-war, no-peace, concentrating instead on the Palestinian
peace initiative which has been reconfirmed by this and the
previous summits with a view to sparing the region catastrophic war
with weapons of destruction that are proliferating in our area, be
they conventional, nuclear or other kind of weapons. Hence our
concept of peace and prevention of a possible catastrophic war.
This is the line we still adhere to.
   The PLO position remains unchanged. We are against any military
action that targets civilians, whatever form it may take and
whatever the results of such actions. We also condemn the Israeli
crimes and massacres against our workers and children, women and
people that increase day by day as a result of protection that the
U.S. veto provides to Israel, and the continued American support of
Israel.

   If you ask nicely, West Virginians will
send you long letters, postcards, old family photos, maps,
T-shirts, souvenirs _ and perhaps a lump of coal.
   At least that's what 11-year-old Ashley Tanner of Dallas found
out.
   Researching the state for a school project, Ashley wrote to 12
West Virginia newspapers asking readers to send information.
   At last count, she said, she had received more than 3,000
postcards, 250 magazines, 100 maps, 200 pamphlets, 25 newspapers,
75 pictures, 10 cassettes, and 80 ``long, wonderful'' letters.
   She also received T-shirts, pins, flags, cups, a West Virginia
University license plate frame and pieces of coal.
   People even sent books from their personal libraries, just
asking to have them returned when she was finished. They sent old
family pictures, too.
   Her father, Alex Tanner, said letters came from the governor's
office, doctors, lawyers, mayors, college students and coal miners.
   Ashley, who attends Good Shepherd Episcopal School, said only 10
of 50 students received any mail from the states they wrote to.
   ``They thought I was really lucky,'' she said about her
classmates. ``I was getting bags of mail every day and they were
saying `Oh, I hate you' but they were just kidding.''
   The overwhelming response for Ashley impressed her teacher, too.
   She got an `A' on her report.

   Marlon Brando's son make a brief court
appearance Monday and his new lawyer got a postponement in his
murder case.
   Christian Brando's new lawyer, Los Angeles attorney Robert L.
Shapiro, is taking over from attorney William Kunstler.
   Brando, 32, is charged with murdering his sister's boyfriend,
Dag Drollet, 26, at the elder Brando's home May 16.
   Shapiro indicated during the hearing that attempts will be made
to resolve the case without a trial. A preliminary hearing was
postponed until June 25.
   ``We try to settle every criminal case in as fair, just and
equitable means possible,'' he told reporters.
   Drollet's parents attended the hearing. The elder Brando was not
present.
   The actor's son, who has pleaded innocent to killing Drollet,
told police a .45-caliber handgun went off accidentally during a
scuffle over the weapon.
   Prosecutors said there was no evidence of a struggle, and that
Drollet was shot while sitting on a sofa, holding a cigarette
lighter in one hand and a television remote control in the other.
   Brando, who has worked as a welder and tree-trimmer, has been in
custody since the shooting. Bail was denied.
   ``He's very sad, very depressed, very emotional and very
scared,'' Shapiro said outside court.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Flag Law; New Constitutional Struggle Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that Congress
violated free-speech rights when it outlawed flag burning last
year. The decision immediately set off a new political fight over
amending the Constitution to protect Old Glory.
   Speaking for the 5-4 majority, Justice William J. Brennan said,
``Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that
makes this emblem so revered.''
   President Bush and Republican congressional leaders urged quick
election-year action to overturn the ruling by amending the First
Amendment for the first time in its 199-year history.
   Bush told reporters he strongly favors changing the
Constitution, and that he would ``continue to press for what I
strongly believe is in the public interest.''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., predicted an
amendment would be backed by overwhelming majorities in both houses.
   ``Who wants to be against the flag, mother and apple pie?'' he
said.
   However, Democrats prepared to fight what they saw as a
dangerous effort to alter the Bill of Rights.
   ``I hold no brief for the flag-burners. I condemn their ugly
actions unequivocally,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``But
I also reject the suggestion that the only means left for us to
honor the flag is to carve a loophole in the First Amendment. We
don't need to destroy the First Amendment in order to save the
American flag.''
   A vote in the House could come within two or three weeks, said a
spokesman for House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. Foley opposes
revising the First Amendment but has promised not to block House
action on the proposal.
   A constitutional amendment requires approval by two-thirds of
the members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38
state legislatures.
   The issue is expected to be a hot issue in this fall's
congressional and state legislative races.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously in a case from Minnesota that the federal
government may order state National Guard troops to take part in

   In the flag-burning case, Brennan wrote for the court, ``We are
aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to many.''
   But, he said, ``If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.''
   Justice John Paul Stevens said in a dissenting opinion that the
government has a legitimate interest in banning flag burning.
   ``The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality
and tolerance _ ideas that Americans have passionately defended and
debated throughout our history,'' he said. ``The flag embodies the
spirit of our national commitment to those ideals.''
   But Stevens also criticized unnamed political leaders who he
said urge allegiance to the flag for partisan gain.
   ``The integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by
individuals whom it offends, or who seem to manipulate the symbol
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about
meaner ends,'' he said.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Siding with
Stevens to allow a ban on flag burning were Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The vote split was identical a year ago when the court struck
down a similar Texas law against flag desecration.
   The 1989 decision touched off a political firestorm that led to
the federal law invalidated Monday. Democrats in Congress, hoping
to head off a constitutional amendment and neutralize Republican
use of the flag issue, sponsored the legislation.
   Bush, who emphasized patriotic values in his 1988 campaign
against Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, allowed
the bill to become law without his signature. He said he preferred
a constitutional amendment.
   Protesters who burned the flag in Seattle and in Washington,
D.C., in defiance of the law were jubilant Monday.
   ``If people are free to wave the flag in approval of the
government, they must be just as free to burn the flag to express
disapproval,'' said David Cole, a lawyer who represented the
flag-burning protesters.
   The federal law made it a crime punishable by a up to a year in
prison for anyone who burns, mutilates, defaces, tramples the flag
or maintains it on the floor or ground.
   The criminal penalties in the federal law applied equally to
those who defaced or burned their own flag or one owned by someone
else.

   The Supreme Court gave police broad new
authority Monday to stop and question people on the basis of
anonymous tips. Three justices said the ruling makes a mockery of
individual privacy.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, said anonymous tips can justify such
police tactics if the information is corroborated before the person
is stopped and questioned.
   But the corroboration police gather does not have to be criminal
in nature, the court said.
   The decision reinstated Vanessa White's 1987 conviction in
Alabama and the two-year probationary sentence she received for
possessing marijuana and cocaine. A state court had thrown out the
conviction, ruling that Montgomery, Ala., police seized drugs after
unlawfully stopping her car.
   Police had received a tip from an unknown caller who said Ms.
White would be leaving her house at a certain time to drive to a
motel, and that she would be carrying illegal drugs.
   Officers went to Ms. White's home, watched her leave and drive
away. They followed, and stopped her car close to the motel. She
consented to the search in which the drugs were discovered.
   ``Although it is a close case, we conclude that under the
totality of the circumstances the anonymous tip, as corroborated,
exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the
investigatory stop of (Ms. White's) car,'' Justice Byron R. White
wrote for the court.
   The court previously has ruled that police can make arrests only
when they have ``probable cause'' to believe someone is involved in
a crime. But the justices have allowed police to make brief
investigatory stops to question and even frisk someone if they have
a ``reasonable suspicion'' _ a more lenient standard than probable
cause.
   Federal appeals courts and state courts ad been divided in
recent years when ruling whether an anonymous tip to police can
give rise to such a reasonable suspicion. Monday's decision said it
can.
   ``It is not unreasonable to conclude in this case,'' White said,
``that the independent corroboration by the police of significant
aspects of the informer's predictions imparted some degree of
reliability to the other allegations made by the caller.''
   The court's three dissenters _ Justices John Paul Stevens,
William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall _ denounced the decision.
   ``Millions of people leave their apartments at about the same
time every day ... heading for a destination known to their
neighbors,'' Stevens wrote for the three.
   ``Under the court's holding, every citizen is subject to being
seized and questioned by any officer who is prepared to testify
that the warrantless stop was based on an anonymous tip predicting
whatever conduct the officer just observed,'' Stevens said.
   ``The vast majority of those in our law enforcement community
would not adopt such a practice,'' he added, ``but the Fourth
Amendment was intended to protect the citizen from the overzealous
and unscrupulous officer as well as from those who are
conscientious and truthful.
   ``This decision makes a mockery of that protection,'' Stevens
said.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable police
searches and seizures.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-4
decision Monday that overturned the federal law banning flag
burning.
   The opinion of the court was written by Justice William J.
Brennan. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From the majority opinion:
   The government's interest in protecting the ``physical
integrity'' of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need
to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of our nation and certain
national ideals. But the mere destruction or disfigurement of a
particular physical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does
not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way. ...
   The government's interest cannot justify its infringement on
First Amendment rights. We decline the government's invitation to
reassess this conclusion in light of Congress' recent recognition
of a purported ``national consensus'' favoring a prohibition on
flag-burning. ... Even assuming such a consensus exists, any
suggestion that the government's interest in suppressing speech
becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is
foreign to the First Amendment.
   ... Government may create national symbols, promote them, and
encourage their respectful treatment. But the Flag Protection Act
goes well beyond this by criminally proscribing expressive conduct
because of its likely communicative impact.
   We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to
many. But the same might be said, for example, of virulent ethnic
and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and
scurrilous caricatures. ... Punishing desecration of the flag
dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and
worth revering.
   
   From the dissent:
   The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality and
tolerance _ ideas that Americans have passionately defended and
debated throughout our history. The flag embodies the spirit of our
national commitment to those ideals.
   ... the flag is a reminder both that the struggle for liberty
and equality is unceasing, and that our obligation of tolerance and
respect for all of our fellow citizens encompasses those who
disagree with us _ indeed, even those whose ideas are disagreeable
or offensive.
   Thus, the government may _ indeed, it should _ protect the
symbolic value of the flag without regard to the specific content
of the flag burners' speech. ...
   ... the prohibition does not entail any interference with the
speaker's freedom to express his or her ideas by other means. It
may well be true that other means of expression may be less
effective in drawing attention to those ideas, but that is not
itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning.
   ... The freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment
embraces not only the freedom to communicate particular ideas, but
also the right to communicate them effectively. That right,
however, is not absolute _ the communicative value of a well-placed
bomb in the Capitol does not entitle it to the protection of the
First Amendment.
   ... the integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by
individuals whom it offends, or who seem to manipulate the symbol
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about
meaner ends.

   Yitzhak Shamir, a former guerrilla and spy, has
fought most of his life for one goal _ a ``greater Israel'' in
which Jews are safe from what he sees as a hostile world.
   This vision will shape Shamir's agenda in his fourth term as
prime minister and leader of Israel's new right-wing coalition
government, sworn in Monday.
   Shamir has said Israel must return ``not an inch'' of occupied
Arab land and instead expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, land won from the Arabs in the 1967 Middle East war.
   His Likud bloc wants the territories as a security buffer, and
as an intergral part of Israel.
   The Polish-born Shamir's emphasis on security has its roots in
the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis.
Shamir's father was betrayed to the Nazis by residents of his
village. Most of the rest of his family also perished.
   Shamir, 74, has balked at attempts by the United States to prod
him toward a more conciliatory approach with the Palestinians. His
new government calls for ``uprooting'' the 30-month-old uprising in
the occupied lands. The revolt has claimed 717 Palestinian lives;
45 Israelis also have died.
   Standing little more than 5 feet, 2 inches tall, Shamir often
presents a glowering appearance with his bushy white eyebrows and
clipped moustache.
   He was born Yitzhak Ysernitzky on Oct. 15, 1915, in Ruznoy,
Poland. As a teen-ager he joined Betar, a right-wing Zionist
movement that wanted a Jewish state in all of British-mandated
Palestine, on both sides of the Jordan River.
   He immigrated to Palestine in 1935 and was quickly drawn into
the clandestine movement to end British rule and establish the
state of Israel.
   He twice escaped from British jails, including one getaway from
a lockup in Eritrea in which he rode hundreds of miles through
sweltering desert heat in the empty tank of a water truck.
   Shamir eventually became a leader of the militant Stern Gang,
blamed for the slaying of Britain's Middle East resident minister,
Lord Moyne, and Swedish U.N. mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, who
opposed making Jerusalem part of Israel.
   After independence, Shamir went into business for several
``unhappy years'' and in 1955 became a Paris-based agent for
Mossad, Israel's secret service.
   In 1965, after reaching a senior level, he retired from the
intelligence service and managed a rubber factory until his
predecessor, Menachem Begin, the Likud founder, brought him into
politics in 1970.
   Shamir built a career on loyalty to Begin, serving as Knesset
speaker and foreign minister before taking over as premier in 1983,
when Begin suddenly quit.
   But he opposed Begin's main achievement, the 1978 Camp David
accords that led to Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
   Shamir said at the time Israel could not trust the Egyptians. He
now argues that Yasser Arafat lies when he claims the PLO has
abandoned terrorism and seeks peace with Israel.
   He also opposed Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and the Labor
Party's attempts with Jordan's King Hussein to arrange an
international peace conference.

   President Vaclav Havel will
probably retain a former Communist as prime minister and ask him to
form the nation's next government, Havel's spokesman said Monday.
   Prime Minister Marian Calfa turned in his Communist Party card
after last winter's revolution, and his continued role as prime
minster for the next two years could draw criticism from Havel's
allies and the Christian Democrats Havel hopes to include in a
coalition government.
   Many of his allies helped in the fight to smash Communist rule
last winter.
   The Civic Forum movement Havel founded to lead the revolution
and its Slovak ally Public Against Violence easily won weekend
parliamentary elections, the first free balloting in 44 years.
Together the parties received about 46 percent of the vote for the
new national legislature.
   The final seat allocation is to be announced Wednesday, but
projections showed they would receive about 170 of the 300 seats.
   The Communists, in a surprisingly strong showing, won about 13
percent of the vote for about 48 seats, and an alliance of three
Christian Democrat parties about 12 percent for 40 seats.
   Separatist movements representing Slovaks, Moravians in the
central Czech lands and the ethnic Hungarian minority in Slovakia
were the only other parties to win seats in the voting Friday and
Saturday.
   In Washington, the State Department said it congratulated ``the
Czechoslovakian people on their achievement in holding free and
fair elections and in their hard-fought battle for representative
democracy.''
   The Christian Democrats and the Moravian parties are the most
likely coalition partners for Civic Forum, presidential spokesman
Michael Zantovsky said.
   All parties have ruled out a coalition with the Communists, and
Civic Forum said Sunday it did not want even respected experts like
the current foreign trade minister, Andrej Barcak, a Communist, to
stay in government.
   However, Zantovsky told a news conference Monday that the former
Communist Calfa probably would ``be entrusted with the role of
forming a new government.''
   He did not say why Havel would choose Calfa to stay on.
   The parliament will elect a president in July, and Havel has
said he will run only if he can appoint a government guaranteed to
act in the national interest.
   ``I think he's perfectly sincere in not insisting on staying,''
Zantovsky said. ``What he seems to be saying basically is that he
can only work with a certain kind of government.''
   Havel's stand puts pressure on all politicians to form the kind
of government Havel seeks. Czechoslovakia's young democracy is so
closely identified with the popular president that a crisis could
ensue if he steps down.
   But Jan Carnogursky, a leader of the Slovak Christian Democrats,
and another Christian Democrat party _ the People's Party _ may
refuse to join the new government.
   By tradition, if the president is a Czech, as Havel is, the
premier should be a Slovak.
   Carnogursky, like Havel a respected former dissident, was
Havel's clear choice for premier during last winter's revolution.
   But now Havel apparently prefers Calfa, who has less charisma
than Carnogursky and because of his unfashionably Communist past
may pose less of a challenge to the president.
   Public Against Violence campaigners hinted before the elections
that they would not be happy with the choice of an ex-Communist as
premier.
   Carnogursky told the Voice of America radio station Sunday night
he was not prepared to play ``fifth fiddle'' in the new government.
   Zantovsky said he believed the Slovak Christian Democrat would
get a ``responsible position'' in the new government and that it
was likely Carnogursky and Havel would discuss the matter Tuesday.
   The People's Party, meanwhile, is angry over allegations by
Havel aides that its chairman, Josef Bartoncik, was a secret police
agent for 17 years.
   While not defending Bartoncik, the party charged that Havel's
government had used ``dirty tricks'' to smear Bartoncik just before
the elections and damage Christian Democrat chances.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization, in a
bid to salvage its dialogue with the United States, on Monday
condemned attacks on civilians. But it did not specifically
denounce a guerrilla raid on an Israeli beach.
   Washington criticized the PLO for failing to explicitly condemn
the raid, implying that the statement failed to meet U.S.
anti-terrorism conditions. However, the PLO news agency WAFA
reported another U.S.-PLO meeting took place Monday in Tunisia.
   The United States has threatened to cut off its 18-month-old
dialogue with the PLO over its refusal to condemn the foiled May 30
attack by a PLO faction. PLO chief Yasser Arafat has disassociated
the organization from the raid but has not personally condemned it.
   ``The PLO position remains unchanged. We are against any
military action that targets civilians, whatever form it may
take,'' said Monday's PLO statement, issued by a spokesman in
Baghdad and distributed by the official Palestinian news hijacking of
the Achille Lauro cruise liner in which a wheelchair-bound American
was shot and his body dumped overboard.
   The beach raid followed rioting in Israel and the
Israeli-occupied territories after the May 20 fatal shooting by an
Israeli of seven Arab laborers near Tel Aviv. Eleven were wounded.
   The PLO statement condemned what it called ``Israeli crimes and
massacres against our workers and children that increase day by
day.''
   The statement came after Sweden moved to prevent a possible
break in the talks between the United States and the PLO, Arab
diplomatic sources said in Baghdad.
   Sweden was instrumental in beginning the dialogue in December
1988.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson sent an envoy, Mathias
Mossberg, to Baghdad over the weekend with a message to Arafat. As
of Monday, Mossberg had met with Arafat three times.
   The Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Sweden had been trying to persuade the PLO to condemn the
foiled raid.
   The U.S.-PLO dialogue began after Arafat renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Since then, there have been regular meetings between PLO
officials and Pelletreau.
   On Monday, the PLO spokesman said the organization ``is still
committed to all its obligations declared in Geneva in 1988 and to
the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy and
Palestinian peace initiatives.''

<HEAD>U.S. Puts Extra Security on Gregg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Monday it has stepped up
security for U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald P. Gregg after
death threats from student radicals.
   South Korean police clashed with students in Kwangju as Gregg
reopened a U.S. cultural center that has been repeatedly attacked.
   Some 500 students hurled rocks and firebombs at police who
blocked them from marching off the campus of Chosun University.
They had claimed they had formed ``death squads'' to kidnap Gregg
during his visit to Kwangju.
   The city 155 miles south of Seoul is a hotbed of anti-U.S.
sentiment. The radicals accuse the United States of condoning the
lethal suppression of anti-government demonstrations in 1980, when
South Korea was still under military rule.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We take all
such threats seriously and be assured that we are taking the proper
security measures and that they are in place.''
   Fitzwater noted radicals broke into Gregg's residence last
October. The ambassador and his wife escaped unharmed. He said the
United States took ``a number of security measures to augment the
situation'' after that incident.
   Gregg, in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the cultural center in
Kwangju, said the United States had erred in remaining silent for
nine years about the Kwangju uprising. ``American silence had
contributed to a hardening of suspicions and mistrust'' among some
South Koreans, he said.
   Gregg is a former CIA station chief in Seoul and a national
security adviser to then-Vice President Bush during the Reagan
administration.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
dispatched an envoy to the White House to study the inner workings
of the U.S. presidency, President Bush's spokesman reported Monday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the visit was arranged after
Gorbachev, meeting at Camp David during his recent summit meeting
with Bush, expressed interest in the operations and organization of
the Executive Office of the President.
   Gorbachev's representative, Mikhail Shkabardnya, the business
manager of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, also will
observe the operations of the Treasury, Justice and Agriculture
departments as well as the General Services Administration,
Fitzwater said.
   The invitation to Shkabardnya was extended by White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu.
   ``He's studying the Sununu efficiency model,'' Fitzwater said
jokingly.

   The White House on Monday saluted the winners
of the elections in Peru and Czechoslovakia and emphasized that the
balloting is still not over in Bulgaria, where the former communist
party was seeking to stay in power.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the results in
Peru ``a victory for democracy in the face of terrorist threats,''
and he congratulated both President-elect Alberto Fujimori ``and
the Peruvian people.''
   ``We look forward to working with the new government,'' he said.
   Initial reports from Czechoslovakia indicate the elections there
``were free and fair,'' he said. ``We congratulate the people of
Czechoslovakia and look forward to working with the new
government.''
   The Czechoslovak returns provided a mandate for President Vaclav
Havel, the playwright and former dissident who played a leading
role in the peaceful revolution that toppled the communist
government last year.
   Havel received a hero's welcome at the White House and in
Congress during a recent visit to Washington.
   Bulgaria could become the only East Bloc country where the
communists have prevailed in elections after a switch to a
multi-party system. Preliminary returns indicated the Bulgarian
Socialist Party, formerly the communists, held a wide lead over the
chief opposition party, the Union of Democratic forces.
   In advance of Sunday's balloting, the State Department voiced
alarm about campaign intimidation and strong-arm tactics by the
ruling party.
   Fitzwater reiterated U.S. concerns going into the election about
campaign ``violence and intimidation'' and limits on the
opposition's access to the media.
   ``The Bulgarian election is not yet completed. There will be a
second round of elections next Sunday,'' he said, adding that the
leaders of the three major parties were meeting with the Central
Electoral Commission.
   ``We are glad to note that an electoral process has been put in
place. This is a step forward in the movement for freedom of
expression by the people of Bulgaria. Needless to say, the final
result is for the Bulgarian people themselves to decide through the
final voting next Sunday,'' said Fitzwater.

   While Americans overwhelmingly voice support for
a constitutional ban on flag burning, researchers say that view is
based more on emotion than on any analysis of free-speech issues.
   From reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to singing the national
anthem at ballgames, rituals celebrating the flag are so ingrained
in American society they raise it to the level of an icon, social
researchers said.
   ``It's a value that's been engendered since childhood, from Cub
Scouts to the Fourth of July parade,'' said Tom Smith, General
Social Survey director at the National Opinion Research Center in
Chicago. ``This is deeply rooted.''
   As such, Americans who are asked their view on flag-burning are
unlikely to mull the free-speech issues that come before the U.S.
Supreme Court, said Smith. Instead, ``What we see is a lot of
visceral reaction to it.''
   That reaction showed up strongly in surveys after the Supreme
Court first ruled last summer that flag burning is a form of free
speech. Seven in 10 respondents, and more in some polls, opposed
the ruling.
   Nearly as many, roughly two-thirds in several surveys, said they
favored a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. That issue
is likely to resurface now that the court reaffirmed its ruling
Monday.
   Smith said those opinions are unlikely to change over time
because they are based on deep-seated values rather than current
events. ``This is a deep, symbolic attachment,'' he said. ``These
kinds of opinions go back to childhood and socialization. They are
very hard to sway.''
   But Howard Schuman, director of the Survey Research Center at
the University of Michigan, said opinions on such matters can
change quickly precisely because they are questioned so rarely.
   ``A sociologist has coined the phrase `cultural cliche' _ it's
like you should brush your teeth twice a day, and you should pay
respect to the flag,'' said Schuman. ``There are a series of things
like this that one learns at a very young age and are rarely
questioned.''
   However, he said, ``In some cases where they do get questioned
people quickly change, because they've never thought about it
before. ... Everybody can switch easily when they have good reason
to.''
   Smith noted that warnings about the potential free-speech
repercussions of a constitutional ban are not widely known, and
could raise opposition once they are circulated. Polls have not yet
probed that possibility, he said.
   If a poll strongly laid out the free-speech issues before asking
opinions on flag burning, some respondents may be less apt to
support a ban. For example, Smith said, polls find opposition to
taxes in general, but support for taxes earmarked for a positive
purpose such as cleaning the environment.
   ``There are certain things that to most Americans sound so
objectionable on their face that you have to explain either the
rationale or the counter-argument,'' Smith said. ``If you just
mention flag burning, you're going to get a majority of people
objecting. You'd get a lot closer to a 50-50 split if you
emphasized free speech as a part of American life.''

   The Bush administration criticized the
Palestine Liberation Organization on Monday for not explicitly
condemning a guerrilla raid on Israel's coast or taking any action
against Abul Abbas, the factional leader whosegroup said it was
behind the attack.
   Nearly identical, cool reactions by the White House and the
State Department to a new statement on the raid distributed by the
PLO's official news agency, WAFA, strongly suggested President Bush
would suspend the 16-month U.S. dialogue with Yasser Arafat's
organization.
   Vice President Dan Quayle assured the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, a leading pro-Israel lobbying group, that Bush
would ``make the right decision'' and that it would be announced
soon.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, addressing the same group, said,
``Obviously, we have been very concerned with the terrorist attack.
... I don't think anyone can look at that and not be concerned
about whether or not the PLO is keeping the commitment they made
when they entered into the dialogue that they would in fact
renounce terrorism.''
   ``We should know something more in the next few days,'' Cheney
said.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Majo American Jewish Organizations, said ``the administration has
no choice but to terminate these talks. At stake is our country's
credibility in the war against terrorism.''
   The United States opened talks with the PLO in December 1988
after Arafat, at the behest of the Reagan administration, publicly
repudiated terrorism and affirmed Israel's right to exist.
   At the same time, the Reagan administration warned the PLO that
if it engaged in terrorism the dialogue would be suspended. Last
Friday, at a news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said that policy had not changed.
   Last March, the State Department reported to Congress that the
PLO had abided by its commitment.
   While nearly 30 border and rocket attacks have been launched by
Palestinian groups against Israel since December 1988, the State
Department said it had no evidence that any of the attacks were
authorized or approved by the PLO Executive Committee or by Arafat
personally.
   The abortive May 30 raid drew an angry reaction from the Bush
administration, however. Abbas, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Front, is a member of the Executive Committee.
   Five speedboats, carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and
machine guns, were reportedly dropped off a Libyan ship 120 miles
at sea. The guerrillas were picked up by radar and intercepted by
Israeli defenders. Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured.
   Last Friday, Bush said he had not decided whether to break off
the U.S. dialogue with the PLO. But he denounced as the attack as
``sheer terror'' and called on Arafat to ``speak out'' and condemn
it.
   Over the weekend, Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to
Tunisia and the sole American diplomat in direct touch with the
PLO, met with PLO officials. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said it was the fourth such meeting since the guerrillas tried to
storm the Tel Aviv beach.
   WAFA reported that Pelletreau met again Monday with PLO
representative Hakam Balaoui. They discussed ``moves to achieve
peace in the Middle East,'' the news agency said.
   The latest PLO statement, quoting an unidentified spokesman in
Baghdad, Iraq, said ``the PLO position remains unchanged. We are
against any military action that targets civilians, whatever form
it may take.''
   The State Department, which had received its own copy of the
statement through diplomatic channels, said it was ``pleased'' with
the disavowal of military action against civilians.
   However, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said, ``We are
disappointed that they have not explicitly condemned the Tel Aviv
raid and refrained from any public comment on Abul Abbas.''
   She said there could be no question that the PLO knows what it
should do to meet U.S. conditions. ``There is not much doubt it,''
the spokeswoman said.
   For instances, Ms. Tutwiler said, Bush had called on Arafat to
speak out.
   Quayle, meanwhile, said the Reagan administration began the
dialogue because Palestinians otherwise were less likely to become
engaged in Mideast peace efforts. The vice president said the
United States never sought to bring the PLO into the process
``through the back door'' or sought establishment of a Palestinian
state.
   Baker, last Friday, said the U.S. dialogue with the PLO was not
part of the negotiations process.
   Asked when the Bush administration would decide whether to
suspend the talks with the PLO, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We've never
put a time-frame on it.''
   White House spokesman Fitzwater, meanwhile, said there was no
``timetable'' for a decision.

<HEAD>Bush Spokesman Suggests Budget Talks Involve Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's budget talks with Congress
involve taxes, his spokesman indicated Monday in lowering his guard
long enough to suggest what no other White House official had yet
publicly uttered.
   But Marlin Fitzwater quickly amended his remarks to erase the
taboo ``t'' word.
   Fitzwater was asked at his daily press briefing if there was
significance to the fact that President Bush, in a series of recent
political speeches, failed to repeat his vow against tax increases
as he talked about economic conditions.
   ``Yes,'' Fitzwater said. ``The significance is that we're
involved in tax negotiations on the hill, where we have agreed ....
''
   When reporters expressed astonishment, Fitzwater backtracked.
   ``I mean the budget negotiations,'' Fitzwater said. ``Budget
negotiations,'' he repeated, ``where we have agreed not to talk
publicly in any way that would specify preconditions.''
   ``And we will not do so,'' the president's spokesman added.
   Bush met Monday with members of his budget negotiating team, led
by Budget Director Richard Darman.
   At that meeting, which Fitzwater also attended, Darman reported
that ``the initial meetings have gone very well,'' the spokesman
said.
   And, while some members of Congress have expressed frustration
with the slow pace of the so-called ``budget summit'' that began
nearly a month ago, Fitzwater said, ``We think the pace is
satisfactory.''
   He said congressional leaders believe a deficit-cutting deal
could be struck before the August congressional recess.
   ``We'd all like to move faster, but we think it's probably as
fast as it's going to go,'' he said.

   A launch company Monday prepared to
send up a Delta rocket with an Indian communications satellite that
was damaged first in a launch pad accident and then by Northern
California's devastating earthquake.
   The unmanned rocket was scheduled to blast off at 1:52 a.m.
Tuesday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
   Abid Hussain, India's ambassador to the United States, said
Monday the satellite will benefit even the poorest and most rural
of India's 800 million people.
   ``We in India believe that science and technology could be put
into the service of the people, especially those people who have
been so far behind of some of the advantages of progress,'' said
Abid Hussain, India's ambassador to the United States.
   ``Through this particular satellite, we would like to spread
education and knowledge, science and new culture to hundreds and
thousands of those who have been out of the mainstream of life,''
Hussain told reporters.
   The $80 million Insat satellite will replace one that was
deployed in 1983 by the crew of the shuttle Challenger. It will be
boosted into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles high about 10 days
after liftoff, said Sastri Vasantha, project director of India's
Department of Space.
   Once it becomes operational in mid-July, the satellite will
provide a telecommunications link in India. It also will send video
and voice signals to television, radio and disaster warning
receivers, and send weather observations to a forecasting center in
New Delhi for distribution across India.
   The satellite originally was scheduled to ride a Delta rocket
into orbit last June, but was damaged in a launch pad accident a
week before liftoff. A cable on a crane broke and dropped a heavy
hook on the satellite.
   Ford Aerospace, which built the satellite, returned the
spacecraft to Palo Alto, Calif. Workers there replaced an antenna
and made other repairs costing $10 million, said Fred Stang,
director of business development for the company.
   The earthquake that struck Northern California in October caused
further damage _ about a dozen cells in the satellite's solar
panels had to be replaced. The cost for that was about $150,000,
Stang said.
   Ford Aerospace has insured the satellite for any problems while
it is on the ground. The Indian government, which also has
insurance, assumes responsibility after liftoff.
   Because of the year delay, India has had to lease the services
of other satellite communications companies, Vasantha said. The
Insat satellite that will be replaced is operating at about 70
percent capacity, he said.
   The new spacecraft is the fourth and final in a series of
India's Insat 1 satellites. It has a working lifetime of seven
years. An updated version, the Insat 2, will be carried into space
next year by Europe's Ariane rocket.
   It is the fourth commercial launch of McDonnell Douglas' Delta
rocket. The rocket and launch services for Tuesday's launch cost
nearly $50 million.

   A governor's consent is not needed for the
federal government to order state National Guard troops to take
part in peacetime training abroad, a unanimous Supreme Court said
Monday.
   The court rejected a challenge to a 1986 federal law by
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota. The statute was opposed
by other governors as well, including Democrat Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, who made it an issue in his unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chief sponsor of the
law, called the ruling a relief.
   ``We just couldn't afford to have a few governors play politics
with this issue just because they objected to the foreign policy
objectives of the administration,'' he said.
   Dukakis had opposed sending National Guard troops to train in
Central America, denouncing the Reagan administration in 1988 for
what he called a ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   He said sending National Guard troops to the region was an
attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   The Justice Department had said Dukakis' position was ``a dagger
aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   By contrast, Perpich did not criticize Reagan or Bush
administration foreign policy but emphasized states' rights. He
said the Constitution gives states veto power over peacetime
training missions for National Guard members.
   Perpich did not object when 12 members of a Minnesota National
Guard public relations unit happened to be training in Panama last
December when U.S. forces invaded to capture Gen. Manuel Noriega.
The Minnesota residents returned to the United States a day after
the invasion began.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing Monday for the majority,
rejected Perpich's constitutional arguments.
   ``The congressional power to call forth the militia may in
appropriate cases supplement its broader power to raise armies and
provide for the common defense and general welfare, but it does not
limit those powers,'' Stevens said.
   ``We conclude that the Montgomery Amendment is not inconsistent
with the (Constitution's) Militia Clauses,'' Stevens said.
   The Montgomery Amendment prohibits any governor from withholding
consent to a National Guard's unit's active duty outside the
country because of an objection to the location, purpose or
schedule of the duty.
   It was enacted after several governors said they opposed the
Reagan administration's Central American policy and did not want
National Guard troops from their states assigned to training
missions in that region.
   The Bush administration said Perpich's challenge to the federal
law was illogical because the governor did not contest the federal
government's power to order National Guard troops to fight a war
abroad but said the federal government lacked authority to prepare
the troops for war.
   There has been dual control over the National Guard since
Congress made it a component of the Army in 1933.
   There are some 460,000 men and women in the Army National Guard
and 115,000 in the Air National Guard.
   Anyone joining the National Guard enrolls automatically in a
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national
armed forces.
   The Army National Guard provides 46 percent of the Army's combat
units and 28 percent of its support forces.
   The Air National Guard provides 73 percent of the nation's
interceptor forces, 25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent
of tactical air support.
   Minnesota's appeal was supported by officials from Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Montana, Ohio and Vermont. Montana later withdrew
from the suit. Most other states sided with the federal government.

   The Supreme Court decision Monday on the flag
protection law set up a head-butting political showdown in Congress
on a constitutional amendment supported by President Bush to outlaw
flag burning.
   ``There are no options left. It's either do nothing, or have a
constitutional amendment. I think we ought to do something,'' said
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader.
   ``The issue is not the flag, the issue is whether we are going
to amend the Bill of Rights,'' countered Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine., blasting Dole for suggesting that those
against the amendment support flag-burners.
   Battle lines formed almost instantly after the Supreme Court
threw out the statute Congress passed last year to penalize flag
burners without touching the constitution.
   The law represented a middle ground between those, including
Bush, who favor a limit on constitutional guarantees of free speech
to make an exception for the flag and those, including Mitchell and
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who view the First Amendment as
paramount.
   Bush said Monday said he was ready to renew his quest. He and
other Republicans, who have used the flag issue against liberal
Democrats, told those who thought the statute would pass muster ``I
told you so.''
   ``Some of us said ahead of time that the legislative approach
would not be upheld,'' he said.
   ``We'll talk about it as we go around the country,'' said Bush's
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. ``We'll ask the Congress to pass it
just as we did in the first case.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., sponsor of the
constitutional amendment, said, ``Either we amend the Constitution
_ as grave and complicated an undertaking as that is _ or else let
the decision stand.''
   ``There is no middle ground,'' he said.
   Foley, D-Wash., promised a House vote before Congress leaves for
its Fourth of July recess. It could come as early as next week,
when the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to act.
   The timing will make it more difficult to oppose the amendment,
its supporters and opponents said.
   ``Who wants to be against the flag, mother and apple pie?'' said
Michel.
   ``It doesn't help at all. It licenses the demagogues,'' said
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., an opponent who is chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution.
Still, he said, ``I'm confident we're going to get enough members
to stand up and say, `No, I love the Bill of Rights.'''
   A constitutional amendment must be passed by a two-thirds vote
in both chambers and then by 38 state legislatures to take effect.
   The Senate last year voted 51-48 for the constitutional
amendment, 16 short of two-thirds. But lawmakers then had the
statute to give them political cover.
   Dole and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., re-intrready for a time
change yet, Fagerland would at least like to synchronize the clocks
in his part of the state.
   ``I'd like to move this confusion west,'' he said.

   Wide-ranging oil-spill prevention and
cleanup legislation was signed into law Monday by Gov. Bob
Martinez, as a crippled Norwegian oil tanker continued to blaze
across the Gulf of Mexico.
   The legislation, introduced in the wake of last year's
catastrophic Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, increases companies'
financial liability for oil spills and increases safety and
training requirements for ships and terminals.
   ``So much of Florida's appeal rests with its unique coastline,
and we simply can't afford to risk a repeat of the tragic Alaska
oil spill here,'' Martinez said.
   The governor also noted the ongoing battle to contain the
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, 57 miles southeast of Galveston,
Texas, where a supertanker carrying 38 million gallons of oil was
set ablaze and crippled by an explosion Saturday.
   ``These are real problems that do occur,'' Martinez said. ``To
our knowledge, there's not another state in the union that has a
bill of this comprehensive nature dealing with oil spills.
   ``I believe that others will begin to follow suit for the same
reasons we did. They have coastlines to protect, and the only way
to protect is to be able to immediately respond,'' he said.
   The legislation, which is a compromise with oil shippers and
retailers, requires vessels and terminals to produce detailed
spill-response plans, and terminals to buy equipment to quickly
contain a spill.
   Only certified pilots or deputy pilots will be allowed to move
large ships in Florida waters, which extend 3 miles into the
Atlantic Ocean and 10 miles into the gulf, which is shallower
closer to shore.
   Fines of up to $25,000 could be assessed for violations.
   Where oil and other potential pollutants are loaded and unloaded
in large quantities, terminal operators will have to use booms to
seal off surrounding waters to contain any spills.
   Liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs for
transporters and cargo owners jump to $50 million from $14 million.
The state would have to go to court to collect any of that money.
   In addition, if future oil drilling is approved off Florida's
coast, the cap on a state fund to pay for spill cleanups would
double to $100 million, using an existing 2-cents-a-barrel excise
tax on oil and other potential pollutants.
   If a major spill depletes the fund, now at $32 million, the
governor and Cabinet could increase the tax to 10 cents until the
fund is replenished.
   Environmentalists generally praised the law as a positive first
step in protecting the state from oil spills, but said more must be
done.
   In particular, the financial limits on cleanup liability for oil
companies and shippers should be removed, said Ann Whitfield of the
Florida Public Interest Research Group, citing the $2 billion cost
of the Valdez spill.
   ``This is a dramatic improvement but it still maintains the
principle that the oil industry should be protected from cleanup
costs,'' Whitfield said. ``If they were not protected, it would be
a financial incentive for them to have the safety equipment to do
the job.''
   Although the law is likely to raise oil companies' costs of
doing business in Florida, Martinez cited the size of the state's
market.
   ``You have no costs if you do it right,'' the governor added.
``The cost only comes if you don't take the proper precautions.''

<HEAD>More Americans Concerned About Threats to Privacy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans are becoming more concerned that
businesses and the government are invading their privacy by asking
too many questions and sharing the information with others, a poll
released Monday said.
   Seventy-one percent of those surveyed by Louis Harris &amp;
Associates believe consumers ``have lost all control'' over how
companies use information about them and circulate it to other
firms, the poll said.
   The poll was commissioned by Equifax, an Atlanta-based
corporation that provides clients with credit, insurance and
marketing information about potential customers.
   The poll said that 79 percent of the public is either very
concerned or somewhat concerned about threats to their personal
privacy, compared with 77 percent in a 1983 Harris survey and 64
percent in 1978. In 1970, only 34 percent said they were concerned
about privacy issues.
   Thirty percent said they had decided against applying for a job,
credit or insurance because they didn't want to provide certain
kinds of information about themselves, the survey said.
   But 78 percent said they would be upset if they couldn't get
credit based on their record of paying bills, the survey said.
   Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris, said the poll sends
a warning to private business, adding, ``It would be a serious
mistake for business to ignore the high and growing levels of
concern that we are reporting today.''
   Most Americans are willing to give personal information when
they believe it will be used in ways they consider proper, such as
employers checking whether a job applicant has a criminal record
and credit card companies checking a person's credit history, the
poll said.
   Eighty-three percent of the respondents said employers should be
allowed to require drug tests for job applicants.
   Sixty-nine percent said phone companies should be allowed to
offer ``Caller ID,'' which displays the phone number of an incoming
call, if customers can ``block'' their number from being shown.
   The random telephone poll included 2,254 interviews in January
and February, and an additional 2,253 interviews in April, with
about half of the first group of people being re-interviewed. The
margin of error was plus or minus 2 percent.

<HEAD>Case of Missing Desk Continues to Baffle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mystery fans, take heart. There may yet be a
solution to the Case of the Missing Desk.
   For the time being, though, followers of this enduring Boston
mystery are going to have to settle for clues that only raise more
questions. Did the mayor do it? Which mayor? And whose desk is it
anyway?
   Here's the lowdown: The ornate, hand-carved mahogany desk
supposedly belonged to legendary four-term Mayor James Michael
Curley, who left office in 1949, but the furniture disappeared when
Mayor Kevin White left office in 1984.
   Now Mayor Raymond Flynn wants it back. And White says he may be
able to find it. But he says it wasn't Curley's desk to begin with.
   Got it?
   The desk has become something of a cause celebre in Boston,
where it has been rumored to be hidden in White's Beacon Hill
townhouse, his Cape Cod summer home, with his relatives, in a
courthouse basement or in an office building near City Hall.
   The Suffolk County district attorney's office has investigated
and found nothing. A Boston radio state has offered an expense-paid
trip to Ireland for its recovery.
   Still, no desk.
   In a television interview Sunday, White revived the mystery.
When asked him about the desk, he said, ``Gee, I can only blush at
that. I don't know, as God is my judge, where the Curley desk is.''
   And anyway, he said, the desk was originally his, not Curley's.
   Curley served four non-consecutive terms between 1914 and 1949.
   White, who served four consecutive terms from 1968-84, said an
aide told him before he left office that ``somebody thinks that's
the Curley desk, and Flynn wants it. You'd better leave it.
   ``And I said, `It isn't the Curley desk. Flynn can't have it. I
want it and that's the end of that.'
   White said he went on vacation and the desk disappeared. ``And
now I don't know where it is, but I can find it,'' he said.
   White said he doesn't know what to do with the desk once he
finds it.
   ``The question is: Do I produce the Curley desk that I know is
not the Curley desk and let them believe it? Or, do I refuse out of
obstinacy to give them the desk they think is the Curley desk,
which I know it isn't?''
   But Flynn said he believes White knows where the desk is hidden
and that it indeed belonged to Curley.
   ``It's pretty obvious James Michael Curley had a desk,'' said
Flynn. ``There are pictures of him sitting behind it. It's
legendary. Prominent people appeared in the mayor's office.''

<HEAD>Co-Founder of Fine Arts Radio Station Dies of Cancer at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rita Jacobs Willens, co-founder of acclaimed fine
arts radio station WFMT, has died of lung cancer at age 62.
   Mrs. Willens died Sunday at her home in suburban Barrington
Hills.
   With her former husband, Bernard Jacobs, Mrs. Willens helped
prove that a commercial station shunning pop music could thrive.
   Founded 40 years ago, the station is known for broadcasting
classical music, live concerts, jazz seminars and documentaries by
Chicago author Studs Terkel.
   She joined radio station WOAK-FM in suburban Oak Park and in
1950 married Jacobs, the station's general manager. He changed the
station's format from pop to classical and the couple presided over
its success under the new call letters.
   The station grew in stature by syndicating programming,
including symphonies and Terkel's interviews, to more than 500
radio stations.
   ``I heard her playing Woodie Guthrie. That's why I joined,''
Terkel recalled. ``The station was something wholly different,
based on the idea that there's a Chicago public, of all sorts of
people, who deserved better than what they were getting.
   ``She had great energy and imagination,'' Terkel said of Mrs.
Willens. ``She and Bernie shared a vision that people had better
taste than they were given credit for.''
   The couple divorced in 1966; the station was sold to WGN
Continental Broadcasting Co. two years later. In 1967, she married
ad executive David Willens, who died in 1986. Jacobs died in 1975.
   WGN donated the station to its current owner, the Chicago
Educational Television Association. Mrs. Willens maintained ties to
WFMT until 1981.
   She is survived by two sons, two daughters and a sister. A
graveside service was scheduled for Monday at Westlawn Cemetery.

   Marion Barry has made a firm decision to
abandon his re-election plans but has put off an announcement for
several days in an angry reaction to pressure from Jesse Jackson
and others, sources close to the mayor said Monday.
   Barry had planned to make his decision public Monday night in
hopes of restarting stalled plea bargain talks as jury selection
continued in his drug possession and perjury trial, the sources
said.
   However, a scheduled interview on a local television program was
canceled, Barry press spokeswoman Cheryl Crowell said.
   More meetings with campaign officials are in the planning
stages, but the mayor is now expected to announce his decision
later this week, one Barry aide said.
   The embattled mayor met with about a dozen top advisers and
fund-raisers Sunday night to discuss his political future.
   The aide, who attended the meeting and described it only on
condition of anonymity, said Barry was clear in telling the group
he would not seek a fourth term.
   ``He was resolute, as firm as he could be,'' said the aide.
``With him, he can always change his mind, but he's pretty far down
the road.''
   Barry is delaying making the announcement because of pressure
from Jackson, from District Delegate Walter Fauntroy _ who is a
candidate to succeed Barry as Mayor _ and from others who have
urged him publicly to drop out of the race, the sources said.
   ``There have been some intrusive parties, Jesse and others,''
one source said. ``The man wants to act on his own, without seeming
to be pushed around.''
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug
use.
   Plea discussions, which started more than two weeks ago, broke
down last week with U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens insisting that
Barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor willing to
consider only a misdemeanor plea, sources familiar with the
situation have said.
   The talks have not revolved around Barry's re-election plans,
the sources said. Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Stephens, was not
immediately available for comment.
   A guilty plea to any of the perjury charges probably would
result in Barry drawing a prison term under federal sentencing
guidelines. In that event, he could not continue to hold office or
run for re-election.
   Sources close to Jackson said he is miffed that the mayor has
failed to announce his decision not to seek re-election after
telling the civil rights leader first that he would make the
announcement Friday and then that he would reveal his plans Monday.
   Jackson has said publicly that he urged Barry to drop his bid
for the mayor's chair and seek a plea agreement in order to spare
the city the pain of a drawn-out trial. Jackson also predicted last
week that Barry would make the announcement soon.
   Jackson was traveling and not immediately available to comment.
   Meanwhile, 10 prospective jurors were added to the jury pool
Monday, bringing the total number of potential jurors to 58.
   Excused from jury duty was a woman who said she knows a Barry
bodyguard, James Stays.
   The woman said she had asked Stays whether the mayor used drugs
and Stays told her no. The bodyguard is on the list of witnesses
the mayor might call in his defense.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson questioned
whether the woman would be able to consider Stays' testimony fairly
and impartially given the fact that she said she has known the
bodyguard for several years and speaks to him frequently.
   Another prospective juror, a man, said the Barry case has left
an ``impression of sleaze that has rubbed off on everyone.''
   Barry spent the day in court and bantered with reporters as he
left the courthouse, but did not respond to questions about whether
he intended to announce he would not seek re-election.

   Here is a chronology of events involving the
Supreme Court's decisions on flag-burning and efforts to reinstate
penalties for desecration.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1989</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   June 21 _ The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, declares that
burning the American flag as a form of political protest is
constitutionally protected free speech, saying ``we do not
consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration.'' The defendant
in the case, Gregory Johnson, had burned the flag at the 1984
Republican Convention in Dallas.
   
   June 22 _ Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., introduces a proposed
constitutional amendment ``to protect the dignity of the U.S.
flag.'' A flag-burning was reported in Berkeley, Calif. President
Bush told a New York audience, ``Flag burning is wrong _ dead
wrong.''
   
   June 23 _ The Senate passes legislation to outlaw flag
desecration. The sponsor, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he was
confident the measure was constitutional. House Speaker Thomas
Foley says that changing the Constitution should be viewed with
caution.
   
   June 26 _ President Bush's spokesman says he supports
legislation to restore criminal penalties for flag desecration but
hadn't decided whether to back a constitutional amendment to
overturn the Supreme Court decision.
   
   June 27 _ Bush calls for a constitutional amendment to bypass
the Supreme Court ruling, saying ``I will uphold our precious right
to dissent, but burning the flag goes too far.'' The House approves
a resolution expressing ``profound concern'' over the court
decision.
   
   June 29 _ Bush and congressional Republicans agree on a proposed
constitutional amendment. House members hold an all-night
speechmaking session on the flag issue in an empty chamber.
   
   July 13 _ Congress opens hearings on the flag-burning issue,
with conservatives seeking a constitutional amendment but Democrats
backing a change in law instead.
   
   July 27 _ The House Judiciary Committee approves a
flag-protection bill over Republican objections that it wouldn't
overcome the Supreme Court decision.
   
   Aug. 10 _ The American Bar Association's policy-making body
votes to oppose a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration.
   
   Sept. 12 _ The House votes 380-38 to approve legislation
restoring criminal penalties for flag-burning.
   
   Sept. 21 _ The Senate Judiciary Committee approves a proposed
flag bill and disapproves a constitutional amendment but sends both
to the floor for action.
   
   Oct. 15 _ The Senate approves a flag desecration bill 91-9. Bush
says he respects ``the intention'' but still will seek a
constitutional amendment.
   
   Oct. 12 _ The House votes final approval for the flag bill,
371-43. The next day, Bush says he'll allow the bill to become law
without his signature.
   
   Oct. 19 _ The Senate defeats an anti-flag-burning constitutional
amendment, with the 51-48 vote falling 15 votes short of the
two-thirds majority needed for passage.
   
   Oct. 28 _ The flag desecration law takes effect, and minutes
later a Seattle crowd torches a pile of American flags, chanting
``burn, baby, burn.'' Four people were arrested. Flag burnings
occur in other cities in following days, and three people were
charged with burning a flag on the U.S. Capitol steps on Oct. 30.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1990</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Feb. 21 _ A federal judge in Seattle rules the flag desecration
law is unconstitutional.
   
   March 5 _ A federal judge in Washington D.C. rules the law is
unconstitutional. The law provides for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   
   May 14 _ The Supreme Court hears arguments on the new flag
desecration law.
   
   June 11, 1990 _ The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 split identical to
that in the 1989 ruling, struck down the new federal law that
outlaws burning the American flag, saying the ban ``dilutes the
very freedom that makes this emblem so revered.''

   The United States and Mexico took a first step
Monday toward negotiating a free trade pact that a White House
official said could one day lead to a single North American market.
   President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
agreed at a private dinner Sunday night to have their trade
officials begin preparations for the formal talks, Bush spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The presidents agreed that the greatest possible mutual
benefit would derive from an agreement that entails gradual and
comprehensive elimination of trade barriers,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said ``preparatory work'' by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and Jaime Puche, Mexico's minister of commerce and industrial
development, would be done between now and December, when the two
presidents will meet again.
   That session is tentatively scheduled for Monterrey, Mexico.
   Salinas told U.S. business leaders that ``the most important
immediate result'' of a U.S.-Mexican free-trade agreement ``will be
to increase trade and investment flows between both nations.''
   ``We need our exports to have stable, secure access to the U.S.
market,'' he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Business
Round Table. In exchange, Salinas said, Mexico will provide new
markets for U.S. goods and new investment opportunities for
American businesses.
   ``Mexico does not want to be late for the world's appointment
with the 21st Century,'' Salinas added.
   The two countries will seek a pact that will ``improve and
expand the flow of goods, services and investment between the
United States and Mexico,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said changes in immigration and emigration laws were not
envisioned.
   The United States signed a free-trade pact with Canada in 1988,
under which all tariffs and other trade barriers are being
eliminated by the year 2000.
   In his 1988 campaign, Bush proposed a single North American
``trade zone,'' a unified market of 335 million people without
trade barriers.
   Bush still advocates such an approach and ``it is anticipated
that would be an end result'' of a trade agreement with Mexico,
Fitzwater said. However, he noted a separate free-trade pact would
also have to be struck between Mexico and Canada.
   Bush called Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Sunday
night to tell him of the developments, Fitzwater said. Mulroney
``was supportive,'' the spokesman added.
   Bush promised the Canadian leader to ``maintain a liaison and
consultations as we go through the process,'' the spokesman said.
   Such a pact would require congressional approval before formal
negotiations could commence. Fitzwater said the administration
envisioned sending the same general kind of legislation to Congress
that set up the U.S.-Canada talks.
   That measure spelled out a timetable and required Congress to
put the final agreement on a ``fast track'' to keep it from getting
bogged down.
   Even so, negotiations on the U.S.-Canadian pact took nearly four
years.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Salinas see free trade as a ``powerful
engine for economic development.''
   In addition to eliminating tariffs, Fitzwater said a free-trade
agreement would also have as a goal doing away with or ``the
fullest possible reduction'' of other barriers to trade. The
spokesman cited import quotas, licenses and technical barriers.
   Salinas, in Washington also met Monday with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and members of Congress. He was to meet on
Tuesday with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Although the United States has pressed for free trade between
the two nations, Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, initially
was cool to the idea. However, more recently he has suggested that
an economic recovery in Mexico will not be possible without it.
   His change of heart occurred after Mexican efforts to seek
foreign investment from Europe fell far short of expectations.
   Mexico is the United States' third largest trading partner after
Canada and Japan, with two-way trade of $52 billion last year.
   The United States shipped $24.97 billion worth of exports into
Mexico in 1989 and imported $27.19 billion in Mexican goods _ for a
U.S. trade deficit with Mexico of $2.2 billion.
   Winning congressional agreement on an elimination of all trade
barriers with Mexico could prove more difficult than getting
passage of the Canadian pact.
   The AFL-CIO has voiced skepticism about such an arrangement,
suggesting that a free-trade pact could cost jobs in the United
States once tariffs were removed on Mexican products made by
low-paid Mexican workers.
   ``The jobs issue is a difficult one,'' Fitzwater said. ``It's
one both sides are aware of. We want an agreement that is
beneficial to both sides, both in terms of investment as well as
jobs and labor markets.''
   Salinas, in his speech, called ``unfounded'' concerns by U.S.
labor of job losses.
   ``To assume that the creation of new jobs in Mexico will be
attained at the expense of the American worker is to ignore
Mexico's enormous potential as a market for United States exports
and the complementarity of our economies,'' he said.

   Scientists plan to detonate the second
announced underground nuclear weapons test of the year Wednesday at
the Nevada Test Site, the Department of Energy said.
   The test, with a yield of between 20 and 150 kilotons, may be
felt in highrise buildings as far away as Las Vegas, 85 miles from
the blast site, the DOE said. Workers were warned not to be in
precarious positions at the time of detonation.
   Barring weather problems or technical difficulties, the DOE said
the weapon will be detonated at 9 a.m., some 2,200 feet beneath the
surface of Pahute Mesa.
   The test is the first since March 10 and only the second of the
year at the nation's nuclear proving grounds.
   Last year, 12 nuclear weapons were exploded underground at the
desert site. In recent years, the DOE has tested an average of
about one nuclear weapon a month.
   The test will be the 701st since testing began at the site in
1951.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants More Regulations For Cosmetics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More effective and consistent regulation is
needed to ensure the safety of cosmetics that do more than cleanse
and beautify, a House subcommittee chairman said Monday.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation, said too many products that meet the
definitions for both cosmetics and drugs slip through regulatory
cracks in current law.
   This group of ``cosmeceuticals'' _ including anti-wrinkle and
anti-aging creams, moisturizers, astringents and skin firmers _ are
regulated on the basis of marketing claims.
   Wyden released a Congressional Research Service report that he
said shows ``two products with exactly the same ingredients can
fall under entirely different regulations based on the fancy
wording of smart advertisers.''
   Current law defines a cosmetic as something that is used to
clean and beautify. A drug, under the law, is something used to
diagnose, cure, treat, prevent disease or alter the structure or
function of the body.
   While drugs must undergo safety and effectiveness testing before
they can be marketed, cosmetics ``are the least regulated articles
under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,'' the report said.
   In deciding whether a product is a cosmetic or a drug, the FDA
looks at ``intended use,'' as reflected in the manufacturer's
claims for the product, the report said.
   For example, a skin lotion that claims to physiologically get
rid of wrinkles is classified as a drug and must be safety tested.
However, if the same lotion claimed only to beautify the skin, it
would be considered a cosmetic and free of regulation. If it claims
to be a sun screen, it is a drug.
   Wyden said the ambiguity in the current law, which dates to
1938, needs to be corrected to ensure that all cosmetics are safe.
   The report offered several legislative options to clarify the
classification of drugs and cosmetics.
   Wyden will use it to help draft legislation providing for
minimal regulation of the $18 billion a year cosmetics industry.
Provisions are expected to include registration of manufacturers
and requirements that they submit injury and testing reports to the
Food and Drug Administration, a spokeswoman for the congressman
said.
   FDA officials were reviewing the report.

   One year after a wildcat miners strike
erupted in the Appalachian coal fields, calm reigns above and below
ground.
   Miners angry about stalled settlement talks between The Pittston
Co. and workers taking part in a sanctioned strike began walking
off the job a year ago Tuesday.
   The wildcat strike lasted about six weeks and idled 46,000
miners.
   ``It's the closest I've come to seeing what they call
spontaneous uprisings in Poland or Czechoslovakia,'' said UMW
spokesman John Duray in Washington, D.C. ``One day everything's
peaceful and the next day everything starts.''
   Within 10 days, the sympathy strike that began in southern West
Virginia had spread to 10 states. United Mine Workers officials
ultimately ordered a cooling-off period and miners returned to work.
   Other states affected were Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Missouri and Tennessee.
   Coal company officials are reluctant to talk about the wildcat
strike, but Duray said there is one obvious lesson for both
management and labor.
   ``Considering the nature of these walkouts, I'd say solidarity
is alive and well in the (United) Mine Workers,'' Duray said.
   The Pittston strike, which idled about 1,700 union miners in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, began April 5, 1989, and was
settled on New Year's Day. The miners went back to work in February.
   Most of the legal disputes stemming from the Pittston strike
have been settled, but the same can't be said about the lawsuits
and National Labor Relations Board complaints filed because of the
wildcat strike.
   Union officials said they did not authorize the wildcat action,
but have reached a tentative settlement with the NLRB on hundreds
of coal company complaints alleging that the union organized the
walkouts in a bid to pressure Pittston.
   The union says it won't release details of the settlement until
it is completed.
   Dozens of lawsuits filed by coal companies seeking to recover
income lost because of the wildcat strike are pending.
   The walkout was the first major wildcat strike by miners since
the late 1970s, when such actions could be counted on to bring
production to a halt, often because of issues outside the coal
companies' control.
   ``You had in West Virginia in the 1970s strikes over the
textbooks used in the schools, strikes over gasoline lines, all
kinds of (things) happened,'' Duray said.
   In one incident, miners at a western Pennsylvania mine walked
off the job for two days because of a report that a worm had been
found in a water cooler.
   Union president Rich Trumka has softened some of the union's
oldtime militancy, favoring selective strikes over wildcat walkouts
and persuading members to abandon their once-ironclad policy of
``no contract, no work.''

<HEAD>Mandela Says ANC Deserves Sole Credit for Ongoing Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela told thousands of
cheering supporters Monday that the African National Congress, not
the South African government, deserves sole credit for initiating
peace talks.
   He also urged continued pressure for economic sanctions as long
as apartheid exists in South Africa.
   ``Sanctions were introduced at the insistence of the African
National Congress for the purpose of removing apartheid in all its
forms,'' Mandela said.
   ``The idea was to ensure all people of South Africa _ black and
white _ are able to determine their own affairs ... to ensure a
non-racial, democratic and united South Africa. We are still very
far from that.''
   Mandela, deputy leader of the ANC, spoke to about 4,000 people
outside the headquarters of the opposition West German Social
Democratic Party, which invited him to visit. He stopped in the
West German capital on a tour of Europe and North America to argue
against lifting of sanctions against South Africa.
   Britain and some other countries have said President F.W. de
Klerk should be rewarded for his steps toward ending South Africa's
racial strife, including freeing Mandela after 28 years in jail;
legalizing the black nationalist movement; and lifting the state of
emergency in three of the four provinces.
   Mandela, 71, said de Klerk should be admired for having the
courage to say the government's previous position was wrong, but
that it was ANC campaigning and economic sanctions that finally
brought the government to peace talks.
   ``The credit for the discussions that are now going on in South
Africa in the search of peace comes to the African National
Congress and the African National Congress alone,'' the black
leader said.
   Mandela criticized countries that may be considering lifting
sanctions, saying they were not thinking of South Africa as a
whole, but only of the white minority.
   ``One of the most dangerous tendencies in the world is people
who always think in terms of their flesh and blood when they're
dealing with problems. Those who call for the lifting of sanctions
are making precisely that mistake,'' Mandela said.
   He said the reality in South Africa was that ``apartheid was
still in place.''
   ``There are blacks who have no rights. There are whites who
enjoy all the basic human rights.''
   The European Economic Community, to which West Germany belongs,
agreed on non-binding measures against South Africa in 1986,
banning imports of iron, steel and gold coins and banning new
investments in South Africa.
   Britain unilaterally lifted its ban on new investments in South
Africa in February. The sanctions issue is expected to come up at a
meeting next week in Luxembourg of the 12 EEC foreign ministers.
   Mandela and his wife, Winnie, arrived in Bonn Sunday night.
   On Tuesday, Mandela will meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   At a dinner Monday for Mandela, former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt called Mandela ``the truly legitimate spokesman for
the majority of South Africa's population.''
   But he noted: ``Nelson Mandela, viewed by many of us as the
future South African president, in his own land still has no voting
right. He cannot freely choose his apartment. Not all public
facilities are available to him.
   ``When he has the same rights as President de Klerk, then the
time will have come to introduce a new era of economic
cooperation.''

<HEAD>Employer Reported in Ecuardorean Jungle To Negotiate American's

<TEXT>
   A ransom deadline set by leftist
guerrillas threatening to kill their American hostage passed
Monday, and the man's employer was said to have gone into the
jungle to meet with the kidnappers.
   Friends and family of kidnapped engineer Scott Heimdal, 27, of
Peoria, Ill., have collected the $60,000 the guerrillas are
demanding, but it was not immediately known if the payment would be
made.
   Jeffrey Fino, local manager of the Iminco mining company, flew
to an airstrip near the San Miguel River, company sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The river runs along Ecuador's
border with Colombia, 100 miles northeast of Quito.
   The sources did not confirm that Fino was carrying the $60,000.
   Heimdal's family in Peoria collected the money from friends and
well-wishers and the cash was transferred to a Quito bank over the
weekend.
   Heimdal's parents plan to come to this Andean nation Wednesday
or Thursday. Volunteers in Peoria have been raising money to pay
for their flight.
   Heimdal was kidnapped on April 28 by members of the Popular
Liberation Army, a small guerrilla group that operates in southern
Colombia.
   He was traveling along the Bermeja River in a boat that was
ambushed six miles from the Colombian border. The skipper was
killed and one passenger wounded in the attack.
   A passenger abducted with Heimdal and later released said the
engineer was taken across the border into Colombia.
   The rebels have released at least two photographs of Heimdal in
captivity. In his latest letter, dated May 14, Heimdal said the
guerrillas moved him every day.
   State Department officials in Washington said the guerrillas
kidnapped two other Americans in the past. One died of a heart
attack and the other was released upon payment of an unspecified
amount of money, they said.
   Officials of the Ecuadorean government and the U.S. Embassy have
not commented on the progress of negotiations.
   A government source, speaking on condition of not being
identified, said low-profile negotiations are most likely to
succeed.
   The source said a Spanish bull salesman kidnapped last month in
Quito by a different band of Colombian guerrillas was released
unharmed upon payment of $1 million. Lack of publicity aided in the
negotiations, he said.

   President Bush met with an East German prime
minister for the first time Monday as the White House cited
``considerable progress'' toward persuading Moscow to accept a
united Germany in NATO.
   But Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said later that he
emphasized to Bush the nature of NATO must be ``significantly
changed'' in order to meet the Soviet Union's security concerns.
   ``I made clear to him what psychological difficulties this would
signify,'' de Maiziere told German reporters as he visited the
Lincoln Memorial after his Oval Office meeting at the White House.
   He added he believes NATO membership for a united Germany ``is
only thinkable'' if a treaty clearly defines the status of Soviet
troops now stationed in East Germany.
   The East German prime minister said it remains open whether such
a treaty should be between NATO and the Warsaw Pact or between a
united Germany and the Soviet Union.
   De Maiziere said Bush insisted such a question would have to be
resolved by the countries negotiating the unification of East and
West Germany.
   The White House said in a statement that Bush and de Maiziere
agreed a united Germany ``should enjoy full sovereignty from the
time of its unification, with no discriminatory constraints on its
sovereignty, and that Germany should be free to choose its own
alliance arrangements.''
   The two leaders met in the Oval office after posing for
photographs on the steps overlooking the White House Rose Garden.
They held expanded talks in the Cabinet Room and lunched in the
family quarters of the White House.
   ``He was so emotional about it. He had never been here,'' Bush
told White House visitors later, describing his meeting with de
Maiziere as ``wonderful.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush stressed his
belief that a united Germany's membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization is essential for European security and will
pose no threat to the Soviet Union.
   The president also said negotiations will result in an end to
the rights held in the two Germanys by the four main victors of
World War II _ the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet
Union.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he is unwilling
to accept continued German membership in NATO on grounds it is a
U.S.-led, anti-Soviet military alliance. He wants a united Germany
to hold membership in the Warsaw Pact as well as NATO.
   But Fitzwater said Gorbachev's summit meeting with Bush early
this month, and later assurances offered by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, may be helping change Gorbachev's mind.
   ``I think we feel considerable progress has been made,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``It's clear that this is going to be a gradual process ... I
can't report any conclusion to the matter, but we do feel progress
is going to be made,'' he said.
   De Maiziere holds the distinction of being the first _ and
probably the last _ prime minister of the German Democratic
Republic to be invited to the White House,
   The two German states are ready to form a monetary union next
month on a basis that will provide large subsidies from prosperous
West Germany for the economically struggling and cash-poor East.
   A German national election could be held as early as next
January to end the division imposed after the World War II defeat
of Nazi Germany.
   Bush, who had dinner Friday night with visiting West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, anticipated de Maiziere's visit as ``just
one more step that demonstrates the magnificent changes that have
taken place over the past year and a half.''
   De Maiziere, 50, is chairman of the East German Christian
Democratic Union. He was responsible for church affairs in the
government of Hans Modrow, the last communist leader.
   In addition to meeting with Bush and Baker, de Maiziere planned
to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington
National Cemetery, meet the president of the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council and deliver a lecture at Georgetown University's
Foreign Service School.
   On Tuesday he will meet with senators and members of the House
and speak at the National Press Club. He will then return to New
York for a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar before returning to East Berlin.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir won narrow
parliamentary approval Monday for one of the most right-wing
governments in Israel's 42-year history, gaining 62 votes in the
120-seat Knesset.
   In presenting his 19-member Cabinet, Shamir pledged to seek
peace but promised expanded Jewish settlments _ a pledge likely to
raise tensions with Washington and the Arabs.
   It is the first government fully in control of the right-wing
Likud bloc since 1984. It takes over at a time of new crisis in the
Mideast, with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein issuing threats
against Israel and Palestinians asking for escalation of the
insurrection in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Monday's vote came after a six-hour debate. Liberal lawmakers
accused Likud of using bribery to forge the coalition with nine
small far-right and religious parties. The rival Labor Party said
the new government cannot bring peace.
   Shamir called the criticisms ``pitiful'' and asked Israelis to
make their No. 1 task the absorption of thousands of Soviet Jewish
immigrants.
   ``This is the mission that will be the focus of government
activity and after it all the rest _ strengthening peace, advancing
toward peace, economy and social problems,'' he told reporters
after the balloting.
   The vote was 62 for the government, 57 against with one
abstention.
   It installed Israel's 24th government since the state's founding
on May 15, 1948.
   Shamir, 74, is serving as premier for the fourth time. He first
got the job in 1983 when Likud founder Menachem Begin stepped down.
   That right-wing government fell later that year, but Shamir
stayed in power until the 1984 elections. Since then, close
elections have forced Likud and the left-of-center Labor Party into
power-sharing coalitions.
   The political bickering that accompanied the new government's
birth raised questions about whether the coalition of diverse
factions could survive until the 1992 scheduled election.
   Shamir and his Likud allies spent the day warding off threats of
defection, and it was uncertain if the Knesset, or parliament,
would back the new government until the vote was cast.
   The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party threatened to pull out over a
police investigation of alleged fraud by one of its leaders, and
four parliament members warned they would abstain or vote no
because they did not get ministerial positions.
   David Levy, a leading Likud figure and the foreign minister,
walked out of a meeting with Shamir because he was only one of two
deputy premiers and not Shamir's undisputed successor.
   But in the end all the defection threats proved empty as Shamir
got the 62 votes he forecast when he announced the government last
Friday.
   Demonstrators gathered outside the Knesset to demand political
reform, shouting slogans about concessions made to bring
ultra-Orthodox parties into the govermennt.
   Amnon Rubinstein of the liberal Shinui Party said the bargaining
amounted to bribery by offering jobs to defectors from Labor.
   Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor compared the new
Cabinet to Begin's right-wing government elected in 1981 that
started the Lebanon war.
   ``This is a narrow government, narrow in its shoulders and
horizons, a government that cannot answer the great challenges and
decrease the great dangers,'' he said.
   Shamir pledged he would continue to seek dialogue with
Palestinians and a deeper involvement of Egypt in peace efforts.
   But he said ``the Arab hatred toward us has not expired. ... The
problem is the rejection of the very existence of Israel.''
   As he spoke of his government's obligation to seek peace, Shamir
was interrupted by jeering from an Israeli Arab Knesset member,
Abdul Wahab Daroushe. He shouted back at Daroushe, ``Shut up and
let me speak!''
   Another Arab parliament member, Tewfik Toubi, said it was ``a
black day'' because Shamir's government relied for support on a
two-member faction called Moledat, or Homeland, which seeks to
expel all Arabs from Israel-held territory.
   Shamir also got into shouting with Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres, who blamed the prime minister for blocking peace moves and
said his new government was dangerous for Israel.
   ``The government proposed today is a shaky one, built on many
legs of clay,'' Peres said. ``Its composition, its guidelines are
not bringing peace. It has no ability to change, no joy of hope. It
is a sad government for its members and a sorrowful government for
Israel.''
   Shamir's last government, an uneasy alliance between Likud and
Labor, collapsed March 15 over Labor's demands that Israel accept a
U.S. proposal for opening peace talks with Palestinians.
   The policy guidelines of Shamir's new government reject talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization and the founding of a
Palestinian state, and he made clear he had no intention of giving
up the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope to create
their state.
   The PLO-backed leaders of the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising
gave their views of Shamir's government in a leaflet that called
the new coalition a ``terrorist government'' and urged escalating
the revolt against occupation.
   Shamir continued to hint at a ``greater Israel'' _ including the
occupied territories _ although such statements have strained
relations with the United States.
   Before agreeing to provide Israel with $400 million in loan
guarantees to help settle a flood of Soviet Jewish immigrants, the
United States has asked for assurances they will not be moved to
occupied land. U.S. policy oppposes all settlements as obstacles to
peace.
   But Shamir has named former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon _ an
outspoken advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories _ as housing minister and head of a Cabinet committee
on the Soviet immigration.

<HEAD>British Hostage in Lebanon Has 76th Birthday, Fate Unknown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Monday marked the 76th birthday of
British pilot Jack Mann _ missing for 13 months now in Lebanon _
and his wife lamented the ``dead silence'' surrounding his fate.
   ``I am not very bright today. There's so little to say,'' said
Sunnie Mann, who spent her husband's birthday in their modest
apartment in a seaside residential district of Moslem west Beirut.
   ``I don't know how he is or how he is surviving. I am doing
nothing today. I haven't gone out. I don't have the courage.''
   She told The Associated Press she hoped her husband could find
the courage to get through his ordeal.
   Mann was shot down six times by Nazi forces as a Royal Air Force
pilot in World War II.
   Mrs. Mann said previously her husband managed to elude capture
after his plane was hit because he would have ``abhorred'' being a
captive _ ``He once flew his burning plane all the way from Germany
to make a forced landing in England. He had severe burns on nearly
nearly 80 percent of his body.''
   ``He is a very brave man. I hope somehow he's surviving, but it
has just been a dead silence, a dead end, a blank wall,'' Mrs. Mann
said.
   ``I haven't heard anything. The embassy doesn't know anything. I
haven't anything to pin any hopes on _ only that he's a natural
survivor and I hope he's all right.''
   Mann lived with his wife for 40 years in west Beirut. He
vanished on May 12, 1989, after setting out from home in his car
for the British Bank of the Middle East in Beirut's Syrian-policed
Moslem sector.
   A group calling itself Cells of Armed Struggle sent a statement
to a Western news agency the next day saying it had seized a a
British captive, without identifying him.
   The British Foreign Office said that statement was the only
indication it had that Mann had been kidnapped.
   The captors released no other communique about him and none of
the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists holding most of the 15
other Western hostages in Lebanon made any claim about Mann.
   Mann came to Beirut after World War II and worked as a pilot for
Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, for about 30
years. He retired in the late 1970s and worked as a bartender in a
west Beirut pub.
   His wife ran a horse-training club in south Beirut that was
closed after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Mann is one of four Britons held in Lebanon. The others are
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and
educator Brian Keenan.
   Six Americans are missing in Lebanon. Longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the AP, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Five other Westerners are also missing.
   Shiite fundamentalist leader Hussein Musawi said on May 29 that
some British hostages would be released if Britain deported
Indian-born Salman Rushdie, a naturalized Briton and author of the
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's late revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in the novel and placed
Rushdie under a death order in February 1989.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London, who by custom spoke on
condition of anonymity, reiterated that Britain would take no
action against Rushdie.
   He said the novel ``is a matter between Rushdie and his
publisher.''

   Palestinian leaders warned Monday that Israel's
new right-wing government will be more prone to violence, and one
predicted it will ``sink Israelis and Palestinians in a sea of
blood.''
   In the occupied West Bank Monday, Israeli troops stormed the
hideout of a suspected Palestinian hit squad in Nablus, killing one
Arab and wounding three, the army said. Another 17 were caught.
   Also Monday, underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising
urged activists to respond to the new rightist government of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir by stepping up attacks on Israeli soldiers
and Jewish settlers in the occupied lands.
   In a leaflet, the pro-PLO underground leaders urged Palestinians
to ``escalate the struggle and burn the ground under the feet of
the occupation army and the settlers.''
   The harsh reaction came as Parliament approved Shamir's
government, which has vowed to crush the 30-month-old rebellion and
also expand Jewish settlement in the occupied lands.
   Shamir has also rejected U.S. proposals for a preliminary
dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo. The PLO and
prominent Palestinians in the occupied lands support such an idea.
   ``This government is an obstacle to the peace process,'' Saeed
Kenaan, a pro-PLO businessman in Nablus, said in a telephone
interview Monday.
   ``Therefore a catastrophe will take place in the region, and I
hold the Israeli government and the U.S. government responsible for
all the repercussions that will arise,'' he said.
   Faisal Husseini, a prominent PLO leader who has been mentioned
as a potential peace negotiator, agreed.
   ``This is a government of war, and I think the decisions of such
a government will be decisions of war,'' Husseini said.
   Palestinians warned that violence would escalate if Shamir made
good on his threats to crack down on the uprising.
   ``This government will sink Palestinians and Israelis into a sea
of blood,'' said Saeb Erakat, a pro-PLO professor and journalist.
   An army official said the Palestinians targeted in the Nablus
raid were involved in killing several suspected Arab collaborators
and firing on Israeli soldiers.
   The group was hiding in a two-level structure in Nablus' crowded
market area, the official said. Troops broke in from the front and
back, killing one Arab and wounding three, he said. A home-made
weapon and a pistol were seized.
   Among the detainees were eight wanted men, the army official
said. He insisted on anonymity.
   Arab reporters identified the slain Palestinian as 19-year-old
Jamal Akliek, 19, and said he was shot in the head and the hand.
They said Akliek was an activist in the Fatah faction of PLO leader
Yasser Arafat and was part of a squad known locally as the
``general security group.''
   The death raised to 717 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops and civilians since the start of the uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Forty-five
Israelis have also died.

   Gov. Bob Martinez on Monday
defended the arrests on obscenity charges of rap musicians and a
store owner who sold their records, calling 2 Live Crew's music
``audio pornography.''
   But entertainment industry lawyers warned the crackdown could
lead to limits nationwide on constitutionally protected free
expression, and predicted that a federal judge's ruling that the
group's album ``As Nasty As They Want To Be'' contained obscene
material would be overturned.
   In an apparent effort to calm tensions, the Broward County
Sheriff's Office and 2 Live Crew arranged Monday to serve a court
appearance notice through the group's attorney instead of directly
on band member Mark Ross, sought on misdemeanor obscenity charges.
   The charges arose from a concert early Sunday at which the group
performed the banned material.
   Band leader Luther Campbell and member Christopher Wongwon were
arrested shortly after the concert and released on $100 bond each.
A fourth member initially was sought but investigators dropped that
warrant after deciding they had insufficient evidence to charge
him, said Sheriff Nick Navarro.
   Martinez, who has publicly attacked 2 Live Crew during his
campaign for re-election, applauded the crackdown but insisted he
did not order it.
   ``Communities have the right to set a standard. I think this is
a form of audio pornography,'' Martinez said. ``A lot of the music
is geared to the abuse of women.''
   He dismissed arguments that the arrests were politically
motivated and possibly violated the First Amendment, noting that
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez had upheld the constitutionality
of Broward's ban on obscenity in ruling last week that the album
contained obscene and illegal material.
   The group's attorney, Bruce Rogow, said he filed an appeal to
Gonzalez's decision Monday with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta.
   ``There is a violation of the law,'' the governor said in
defending the arrests. ``I don't think there ought to be any
consideration because you happen to be well known and happen to
earn a lot of money.''
   Gonzalez' ruling led to Friday's arrest of a Broward County
record store owner after he sold record and tape versions of the
album to an undercover agent.
   Navarro denied he had ordered the musicians arrested because of
obscenities directed toward him by Campbell and the crowd at
Sunday's concert.
   ``I take no offense to any of that,'' he said. ``Let 'em go for
it.''
   Entertainment attorneys said the crackdown would most intimidate
large record companies with connections to government-regulated
broadcast media, making them think twice before signing or
promoting certain artists.
   ``They have no choice,'' said Peter Thall, whose New York firm
represents Foreigner and other music groups. ``This kind of
incident generates fear in any company that has to go before
licensing agencies.''
   Thall also said the arrests smacked of racism.
   Jay Topkis, a New York attorney who successfully beat efforts to
ban D.H. Lawrence's erotic book ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' 25
years ago, said the 2 Live Crew ban seemed to be part of an
increasing effort nationwide to restrict free speech. He cited
recent controversy over exhibits of explicit photographs by the
late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``Some people are making it their business to try to suppress
ideas,'' Topkis said. ``The idea that judges and juries are going
to be deciding that rock compositions are obscene seems to me to be
an invitation to national muzzling.''

   The Soviet and West German foreign ministers met
Monday and said they made progress in discussions on the
reunification of Germany and its military future, the Tass news
agency said.
   The talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
and his West German counterpart, Hans-Deitrich Genscher, came a
week after the superpower summit in Washington.
   At the summit between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Bush, the Soviet leader objected to a U.S. proposal that
a unified Germany join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Shevardnadze and Genscher said at a news conference after their
seven hours of talks they made progress toward finding solutions to
the security aspects of German reunification. They did not
elaborate.
   The ministers said they agreed to meet again in June.
   The talks were held in Brest, near the Soviet Union's western
border with Poland.
   In a report from Bonn, Tass said Genscher emphasized a united
Germany would recognize the current Polish border and renounce any
previous territorial claims to European countries.
   In Bonn, the West German Foreign Ministry said the ministers
also planned to visit the grave of Shevardnadze's brother, a Soviet
soldier who died in Brest during World War II.
   In visits to Canada and the United States, Gorbachev reminded
leaders that 27 million Soviets died in the two world wars with
Germany.
   Brest was previously known as Brest-Litovsk. In 1918, toward the
end of World War I, the Brest-Litvosk peace treaties were signed
there between the central European powers and the Ukraine and
Soviet Russia.
   An independent Ukraine was recognized in one treaty. In the
second, Russia acknowledged Ukrainian independence and also lost
its Polish and Baltic possessions.

   David Levy, Israel's new foreign minister,
worked his way from a ditchdigger to one of the highest-ranking
posts ever held by a North African immigrant.
   A fiery orator, the Moroccan-born Levy, 52, began his political
career in the ranks of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc as a labor union boss championing the causes of the
disadvantaged.
   He advanced quickly in the party and is regarded by some as a
political opportunist who might compromise ideology in his drive to
succeed Shamir as prime minister.
   Although his appointment is welcomed as a confirmation of the
integration Israel's founding fathers espoused, Levy has little
experience in foreign policy.
   Most criticized is Levy's scant knowledge of English, which
could hamper communication with the United States on which Israel
relies for political support and about $3 billion in annual aid.
   But unlike most of his predecessors, Levy is fluent in Arabic.
   Levy has a reputation as a hard-liner, and was one of the party
rebels who forced Shamir to accept crippling conditions to his
initiative to hold elections in the occupied territories.
   But insiders suggest Levy's hard-line had less to do with
ideology than with his desire to oust the Polish-born Shamir as
Likud leader.
   In 1982, he led opposition within the Likud government to
Israel's protracted, three-year war in Lebanon and many of the
military moves of his party rival, Ariel Sharon, who as defense
minister was the architect of the Lebanon war.
   At a news conference this week, Levy said his first task as
foreign minister would be ``to prevent deterioration and to
improve'' Israel's strained ties with the United States.
   Levy's early years were immersed in the poverty that was typical
of many of the 600,000 Jews from Arab lands, or Sephardim, who
settled in Israel in the 1950s and '60s.
   The immigrants and their offspring now comprise more than 60
percent of Israel's 4.5 million citizens and constitute a
disproportionately large number of the nation's poor.
   In his biography, Levy is quoted throughout as being consumed
with anger and resentment toward the Israeli establishment because
of the poverty and neglect he experienced in Beit Shean, a northern
town where he lived after immigrating at age 20 in 1957.
   For Israel's first 30 years, Israel was governed by the
center-left Labor Party, which was dominated by European Jews, or
Ashkenazim.
   ``Why do they take people who come with good will and a lot of
love for the land of Israel and grind it into sand?'' biographer
Aryeh Avinery quotes Levy as saying.
   After spending some time unemployed Levy found work as a
ditchdigger and construction worker.
   He was first elected to the Knesset, or parliament, at age 32 in
1969. He won his first Cabinet seat, as immigration minister, in
1977 and has served as housing minister since 1979.

   A newly renovated museum displaying more than
400 historical objects relating to Abraham Lincoln's assassination
was dedicated Monday at Ford's Th&equals;
   BOSTON (AP) _ Cleanup crews watched anxiously Monday as choppy
seas and stiff winds delayed efforts to unload thousands of gallons
of fuel that threatened to spill from the torn hull of the cruise
ship Bermuda Star.
   The 617-foot vessel was freed Sunday night from a rocky ledge
off Cape Cod, almost 13 hours after it strayed too close to shore
and ran aground in dense fog.
   Divers found a 90-by-2-foot tear on the ship's bottom after it
dropped anchor about 3 miles from the ledge in Buzzard's Bay. The
rip exposed four tanks holding more than 110,000 gallons of fuel
oil, the Coast Guard said.
   About 1,500 gallons of fuel leaked before a containment boom was
put around the ship, and the tear left the potential for more oil
to spill, the Coast Guard said.
   Up to 1,000 gallons of fuel washed ashore at Naushon Island in
Buzzards Bay on Monday, Coast Guard Cmdr. Larry Doyle told an
afternoon news conference in Providence, R.I.
   The oil splashed the largely unpopulated island with a gooey
swath up to 4 feet wide along a five-mile stretch of shoreline,
Doyle said.
   Another 100,000 gallons of what Doyle described as ``thick,
heavy, dense oil'' may leak into the sea.
   ``It has the potential to be a medium spill,'' Doyle said.
   Doyle said the Coast Guard believed it was more prudent to wait
for the weather to clear than to risk the safety of the repair
crews.
   ``I'm not in any rush to hurry through that,'' he said. ``The
vessel is stable, it's safe.''
   Cleanup of Naushon Island, which lies off the tip of Woods Hole
west of the Cape Cod Canal entrance, was expected to begin Tuesday
morning, Doyle said. Water pressing against the ship kept the oil
inside while anchored, the Coast Guard said. Plans to tow the ship
to a dry dock in New York had to be scrapped until the holes could
be patched and the fuel unloaded.
   ``If you moved the ship now the inertia of the sea would take
away the balancing effect we have, and it would suck the oil right
out of the tear in the ship,'' said Steve Aitkins, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Boston.
   But rain and fog, coupled with winds of 15 to 30 mph and
2-to-4-foot waves, threatened efforts to skim off the spilled fuel
and unload the rest.
   ``It's kind of a Catch-22. The weather can help you as much as
it can hinder you,'' said Randy Krahn, a Coast Guard petty officer
in Providence, R.I. ``The rain can help break up the oil, but too
much makes the clean-up harder.''
   Forecasters predicted the weather would get worse before it got
better, possibly on Tuesday morning.
   Aitkins said the Coast Guard's Atlantic Area Strike Team in
Mobile, Ala., has been notified to be ready to move if the oil
starts to leak and local cleanup crews could not contain it.
   The vessel, on a cruise from New York to Nova Scotia, went
aground in fog Sunday morning. The more than 1,060 passengers and
some crew members were ferried to New Bedford in the evening and
taken by bus to hotels in Boston.
   ``There was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise, then
immediately there was an oily smell. We went out on deck and we
could see the oil coming out on the water,'' said passenger Paul
Kelly of Columbia, S.C.
   Tests for drugs and alcohol were performed on key members of the
crew, but the results were not immediately available, the Coast
Guard said.
   David Roddy, senior vice president of Bermuda Star Line Cruises
in Teaneck, N.J., described the ship's captain, Hans Lewing, as
``an excellent, popular captain'' with 20 years of shipping
experience.
   Lewing had been with the company for three years and had a good
record, Roddy said.
   Passengers who had their seven-day excursion abruptly ended
would be offered another week or 10-day cruise or a refund, Roddy
said. The company also would pay their airfare to return home from
Boston, he said.

   Flags flew at half-staff and festivities were
canceled Monday in the Soviet Republic of Kirghizia to mourn the
116 people killed in a week of ethnic clashes in Central Asia, the
Tass news agency reported.
   The official news agency and Soviet television said the
situation in Central Asia had calmed following clashes between
Uzbeks and Kirghiz that broke out after a land dispute.
   ``A trend toward the stabilization of the situation in the
republic's southern region has become apparent,'' Tass said,
quoting the republic's Interior Ministry.
   In Osh, a city near Kirghizia's border with Uzbekistan, shops
reopened and public transport was returning to normal, Tass said.
   The news agency said 116 people died, 468 were wounded and at
least 500 acts of arson were committed in the week of violence.
   In memory of the dead, Tass said, ``flags are flying at
half-mast and all recreational and entertainment activities have
been suspended.''
   Kirghizia's capital of Frunze was calm Monday as television and
radio broadcast somber music in memory of the dead, said Albert
Bogdanov, a journalist with the Kirtag news agency.
   On Sunday, students trying to organize rallies in Frunze's main
square were turned back by Interior Ministry troops and police,
said Ivan Pavlov, a party official in the capital.
   Rallies in Frunze last week turned into demonstrations against
the republic's leaders with thousands of students demanding their
resignations and calling on residents to go to Osh and join the
battle against the Uzbeks.
   Officials from the Communist Party and the government visited
student and worker dormitories Sunday morning to talk them out of
holding rallies, Pavlov said.
   Armored personnel carriers Monday continued to patrol the main
streets of Frunze in districts where trouble had broken out
earlier, Bogdanov said in a telephone interview.
   The bloodshed was the latest ethnic violence to trouble the
government of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Nationalities
in various republics have used the looser atmosphere under
Gorbachev's reform initiatives to vent their frustrations over
political and economic woes.
   The violence started when Uzbeks, who make up one-third of the
population, discovered that Kirghiz were being given land for
housing, which is critically short in the densely populated and
poor regions of Central Asia.
   The fighting spread to districts around Osh, and thousands of
troops were sent in to reinforce the local police. Soviet troops
sealed off the border to prevent thousands of Uzbeks from crossing
into Kirghizia to join the battle.

   On the eve of a critical vote among Southern
Baptist leaders, moderates and fundamentalists both threatened to
back away from the deeply divided church if they lose.
   ``To say this is an important convention is an understatement,''
said the Rev. Daniel Vestal, the moderate standard-bearer for the
church's presidency. ``It's a crucial convention.''
   The voting scheduled for Tuesday afternoon will likely decide
the future of the nation's largest denomination, which has 14.9
million members. The outcome of the so-called ``battle of New
Orleans'' is up in the air, insiders said Monday.
   ``It's going to be close,'' said the Rev. Paige Patterson of
Dallas, a chief fundamentalist strategist. ``Betting on Baptists is
always riskier than betting on the horses.''
   If moderates win, he said, ``I fear the wheels are going to come
off,'' meaning the fundamentalist camp might reduce denominational
support. ``They do not want to go back to funding that which to
them is unconscionable,'' he said in an interview.
   Vestal, of the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, Ga., said what he
characterized as the ``ruthless and destructive'' system of
``enforced conformity'' by fundamentalists cannot continue without
causing widespread non-participation by moderates.
   However, Morris Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, the candidate
of the controlling fundamentalist wing, said the denomination had
been saved from a ``drift leftward.''
   He urged that ``we make complete the course correction and
return'' to belief in the ``inspired, infallible, inerrant word of
God.''
   The belief that the Bible is without error historically,
scientifically, theologically and in other areas has been the
fundamentalist rallying cry in gaining denominational control.
   Most Southern Baptists are conservative theologically and
committed to the Bible as the rule of faith, but historically have
insisted on allowing individuals some leeway in interpreting it.
   Some moderates, including Vestal, espouse a fundamentalist,
literalistic view of Scripture, but contend room should be allowed
for diverse views.
   The church's power lies in its presidency. The president's
appointive power determines trustees of the denomination's network
of agencies, seminaries and other institutions.
   For 11 years, fundamentalists have held the top office. They
have tightened requirements and questioned the beliefs of thousands
of denominational staff workers, including seminary professors.
   The contest is viewed as the moderates' last organized election
effort in the foreseeable future.
   There were thousands of delegates to the convention, called
``messengers,'' in town Monday, and the number was expected to
surpass 30,000 before Tuesday's formal opening at the Louisiana
Superdome.
   The Rev. Adrian Rogers of Memphis, Tenn., a fundamentalist
leader and past president, told a pastors' conference Monday that
he would reassess his participation in the denomination if the
moderate wing wins.
   ``It is better to be divided by truth than to be united in
error,'' Rogers said.
   ``Our beloved denomination is fragmented,'' Carolyn Weatherford
Crumpler of Cincinnati, who is backing Vestal and who for 15 years
headed the church's influential Women's Missionary Union, told a
women's meeting.
   ``The wounded spirit of Southern Baptists needs to be lanced and
opened to the healing air of God's grace,'' she said.

   Ariel Sharon, Israel's most charismatic hawk,
believes the Jewish state must rely on military might rather than
the art of diplomacy to ensure its survival.
   The burly former defense minister and engineer of the 1982
invasion of Lebanon will become Israel's housing minister in Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new government that received
parliamentary approval Monday.
   In that post, Sharon will be in charge of coordinating the
absorption of tens of thousands of Soviet immigrants expected to
arrive in the Jewish state in the 1990s.
   Critics fear Sharon could raise tensions between Israel and the
United States by channeling Soviet immigrants into the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The U.S. administration opposes moving Soviet Jews into the
occupied territories, which it calls an obstacle to peace.
   Sharon has remained mum about his plans.
   ``I will only repeat that Israel is a democratic state and
citizens can live where they want,'' he said Sunday.
   Sharon, 62, who has often followed his own path in politics,
recently angered Washington with his active support of a Jewish
settlement in Jerusalem's Christian quarter.
   Sharon would stroll over daily from his nearby apartment in the
Moslem quarter as a show of Israel's sovereignty over the disputed
city.
   He moved into the Moslem quarter in December 1987 and his
apartment has a permanent detachment of soldiers and paramilitary
border police standing guard outside.
   Sharon has set his sights on succeeding Shamir as prime minister
and the two traded bitter insults a few months ago when Sharon led
a campaign to torpedo Shamir's proposal for peace talks with the
Palestinians.
   The hard-line conditions Sharon wanted to append to Shamir's
peace plan have all been adopted as part of the new government's
guidelines.
   But the Israeli-born Sharon's attempts to become prime minister
have been thwarted by his responsibility for the much-criticized
war in Lebanon in which hundreds of Israeli troops were killed.
   Sharon was forced to resign as defense minister in 1983 when an
Israeli inquiry commission found him indirectly responsible for the
slayings of hundreds of Palestinians by Israeli-backed Lebanese
forces in the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps in Beirut.
   Sharon often boasts about how he crushed Arab unrest when he
served as army commander in the Gaza Strip in 1971 and says it
should be used as a model for suppressing the 30-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands.
   But critics have charged that Sharon's ruthless 1971 campaign
was against guerrilla cells and that the current uprising is a
popular revolt consisting mainly of stoning attacks.
   Last year, Sharon called on the Israeli government to
``liquidate'' PLO chief Yasser Arafat.

   Hundreds of U.S. citizens returned to
America on Monday after fleeing war-torn Liberia, where rebels are
trying to topple the government of President Samuel K. Doe.
   ``It feels wonderful. It feels great'' to be back in the United
States, said the Rev. Henry Hungerpiller, a 69-year-old Orangeburg
native who has served as a missionary in Liberia for 35 years.
   The evacuees, urged by the U.S. government to leave the West
African nation because of warfare, on Sunday flew from the capital
of Monrovia, Liberia, to Abidjan, capital of neighboring Ivory
Coast. They transferred to an American Trans Air chartered flight,
and arrived at Charleston International Airport at 12:25 p.m. EDT.
   At least 170 of the 349 passengers were children, many of whom
received stuffed animals from Salvation Army workers at the
Charleston airport.
   Many evacuees declined to talk to reporters, apparently
concerned about the effect on friends in Liberia or their chances
to return. But those who did speak said fighting was intense, and
many appeared thankful to be out of the country.
   ``Most of the people in Monrovia are very much afraid,''
Hungerpiller said. ``We didn't see any fighting, but they were
getting closer and closer all the time.''
   Hungerpiller worked at a Bible school of about 600 students, 12
miles outside the capital, until it was shuttered because of the
fighting.
   Conditions in Liberia are ``terrible. There is fighting all
over,'' said Solon de Joachim, an educator and businessman en route
to New York with two sons and two daughters to meet his wife and
five other children.
   Johnny Connelly, a 26-year-old missionary from Madison, Ga.,
said basic necessities in Liberia were in short supply before he
fled with his wife, Janice, and their 2-year-old son, Josiah.
   ``It's very tense. Commodities are running short. Rice is
disappearing and gas is disappearing,'' Connelly said.
   ``The United States has been warning us for weeks to go and
leave and now was about our last chance before the rebels come into
Monrovia,'' he said.
   State Department spokesman Jay Rini said there are no plans for
additional flights from Liberia to Charleston.
   The evacuees were flown to Charleston because local authorities
have experience handling similiar situations, Rini said.
   In 1983, American college students were evacuated to Charleston
following the U.S. invasion of Grenada, and last spring military
dependants from Panama were evacuated through Charleston.
   The Liberia evacuees were greeted at the airport by state
Department of Social Services workers whose job it was to make sure
they had enough money funds to travel to their final destinations
in the United States.
   The department provides those who need financial help with
federal loans, spokeswoman Norma Anderson said.
   In Liberia on Monday, peace talks between government and rebel
negotiators aimed at ending the civil war stalled as rebel
officials had difficulty getting their negotiators to the site in
neighboring Sierra Leone.
   The 5{-month-old civil war aimed at ousting President Doe has
left more than 1,000 dead.

   Former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter was sentenced to six months in prison Monday by a judge
who accused him of usurping the power of Congress by lying about
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene was
the first prison term for any of the seven people convicted as a
result of the affair.
   Greene said letting Poindexter off without a prison term ``would
be tantamount to a statement that a scheme to lie to and obstruct
Congress is of no great moment.''
   The judge delivered a stern lecture along with the sentence,
saying Poindexter violated ``a principle fundamental to this
constitutional republic _ that those elected by and responsible to
the people shall make the important policy decisions.''
   ``Their decisions may not be nullified by appointed officials
who happen to be in positions that give them the ability to operate
programs prohibited by law,'' the judge said.
   He said Poindexter showed ``no evidence of recognizing that
principle and the seriousness of its violation.''
   Greene allowed Poindexter to remain free while he appeals five
felony convictions of conspiracy, making false statements and
obstruction.
   And the judge did not impose a fine, noting that Poindexter had
already incurred huge legal bills.
   However, Greene said that allowing Poindexter to get off without
a prison term ``would be tantamount to a statement that to lie to
and obstruct Congress was of no great moment.''
   ``The Congress can't fulfill its constitutional duties if it is
obstructed by high-ranking officials,'' the judge said.
   Poindexter, 53, who served as President Reagan's national
security adviser from late 1985 until revelations about the
Iran-Contra affair forced his resignation in November 1986, is the
highest-ranking Reagan administration official to be convicted of a
felony.
   He was found guilty of lying to Congress in 1986 by falsely
assuring lawmakers that his staff was not secretly helping arm the
Nicaraguan Contras and by giving false testimony and preparing an
inaccurate chronology to conceal U.S. involvement in a 1985
shipment of missiles to Iran.
   Six other men, including retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North, a former Poindexter aide, have been placed on probation
after being convicted or pleading guilty to crimes in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter showed little emotion, except to smile at his wife
Linda, after the sentence was announced.
   The couple kissed and walked arm-and-arm out of the courtroom
after the 40-minute proceeding. As the Poindexters left the U.S.
Courthouse, they briefly joined a throng of 30 supporters who were
carrying banners and chanting, ``Full pardon now.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there would be no
White House comment on the sentence. Asked if he could rule out a
pardon by President Bush of his colleague from the Reagan
administration, Fitzwater said: ``I can rule out having any comment
on this matter while the case is under appeal.''
   North, who was sentenced to community service in addition to
probation, told CBS News, ``Admiral Poindexter is, as he has always
been, a good and decent man and I think it's a crying shame that
he's been treated so shabbily afrter spending more than 30 years in
the service of his country.''
   Greene said that Poindexter, North and others involved in the
Iran-Contra affair ``carried out their own private policy'' by
helping arm the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress passed legislation
forbidding further U.S. military aid.
   ``Admiral Poindexter and his associates obstructed the Congress,
nullifying the decisions that body had made on the issues of
supplies to the Contras,'' Greene said.
   ``They decided the policy of the Boland Amendment was wrong _
they went about to violate it on a large scale and for a lengthy
period, and then to lie about their activities to prevent the
public from finding out,'' Greene said.
   Prosecutor Dan K. Webb had urged the judge to ignore any
argument that lying to Congress ``is a technical violation of the
law.''
   ``This case is a classic example of what happens when these laws
are violated,'' Webb said. ``We literally had this admiral and one
very misguided and confused lieutenant colonel operating a private
war in Nicaragua and Congress didn't know about it.''
   Afterward, Webb said Greene had imposed ``a very fair and very
proper sentence'' that would be a warning to other public officials.
   Defense attorney Richard W. Beckler urged Greene to spare
Poindexter a prison term, saying the retired rear admiral had ``has
always put his devotion to the country above any selfish interests
of his own.''
   While he held a high office, ``I don't think anyone can
appreciate the power and pressure that bears on that,'' Beckler
said.
   ``Every step can be a misstep,'' the defense lawyer added.
``Clearly missteps were taken here.''
   Webb disputed Beckler's argument that Poindexter should be
placed on probation because North and others were not given prison
terms.
   ``John Poindexter is the superior and he, unfortunately, has to
be held accountable for the events that made up Iran-Contra,'' Webb
said.
   Under new sentencing guidelines that do not apply to the case
because they took effect after the Iran-Contra affair, Poindexter
could have been ordered to serve 21 months to 27 months in prison,
Greene said.
   But the judge said it would be unfair to order such a long
sentence while other Iran-Contra figures ``enjoyed the benefits of
probation.''
   In a clear reference to the testimony North gave at his own
trial last year, the judge said that Poindexter ``unlike many
defendants, did not take the stand to exculpate himself by lying
under oath.''
   The judge said that after the Iran-Contra affair unraveled,
Poindexter and North ``engaged in the destruction of evidence _ one
step ahead of the Congress and two steps ahead of the attorney
general and the FBI.''

<HEAD>Report: Rafsanjani Escaped Third Attempt on His Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has
escaped an assassination attempt, the third reported since last
fall, Iran's dissident Mujahedeen Khalq said Monday.
   The group, in a dispatch to The Associated Press in Nicosia from
its Washington office, said the attempt was in late April, but did
not provide an exact date.
   There reportedly have been at least two previous attempts to
kill Rafsanjani, in October and in January. The official media in
Iran has not confirmed either incident, reported separately by
travelers from Iran.
   Rafsanjani, however, has denied the attempts, which the sources
said involved bodyguards trying to shoot the president but being
overpowered by other security men in his entourage.
   The Mujahedeen said in the latest attempt, one of the bodyguards
was planning to ``kill Rafsanjani with a revolver while he was
moving from one location to the other.'' It did not explain if he
was at home or on the road.
   But other bodyguards spotted him, and the would-be assassin was
arrested before being able to pull the trigger, said the statement
from Mujahedeen Khalq, or the People's Warriors.
   The unattributed six-sentence report did not provide any other
detail. It said: ``Security measures to protect Rafsanjani
increased dramatically'' after the incident.
   Iran has been gripped by a power struggle between liberals and
hard-liners since the death a year ago of the founder of the
Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, 55, leads the so-called pragmatists seeking closer
relations with the West to end Iran's international isolation and
attract foreign investment and expertise needed to rebuild the
devastated economy.
   He is opposed by radicals, led by former Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, who believe improving relations with the West
would destroy Khomeini's Islamic ideology.
   Although the Mujahedeen Khalq helped Khomeini topple the
pro-Western monarchy in 1979, they later rebelled against the rigid
domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Islamic Revolution.
   The group is based in Iraq, Iran's main enemy.
   A few of its underground supporters in Iran have survived a wide
crackdown against opposition groups ordered by Khomeini in the
mid-1980s. Thousands of Mujahedeen were arrested and many were
subsequently executed.

   A 58-year-old mother of five who
championed sober driving programs died when a Jeep traveling at
high speed slammed through her house and crushed her as she slept
on the living room couch.
   A man with a record of drunken driving arrests was behind the
wheel, police said. The man, who faces trial this week on an
unrelated intoxicated driving charge, was using a revoked driver's
license.
   Marian Wlodarski, who died at a hospital Sunday after the crash
early Friday, had been active in this Chicago suburb's Safe Ride
hotline program, which provides rides home to teen-agers after
parties.
   Her death shows ``that anyone can be a victim of drunken
driving,'' Linda Phelps, a local Mothers Against Drunk Driving
organizer, said Monday. ``It is a random crime.''
   Mrs. Wlodarski got involved in the hotline program because she
didn't want her 16-year-old son, Marc, or his friends to become
victims.
   Just a week before her death, she helped organize an all-night
alcohol-free graduation party at Andrew High School.
   ``This woman gave a lot to the community,'' Ms. Phelps said.
   The Jeep driven by William Yunker, 28, was traveling close to 70
mph when it smashed into the Wlodarskis' home, police said.
   ``The vehicle went completely through the front window of the
house, across the living room, pushing a couch on which Mrs.
Wlodarski was sleeping into a kitchen area in the back part of the
house,'' police Cmdr. Robert Soukup said.
   Yunker was charged with drunken driving and driving on a revoked
driver's license, Soukup said.
   His license was revoked after an out-of-state drunken driving
arrest.
   Other charges were being considered in the latest case, he said.
   Yunker, who suffered only cuts and bruises in the crash, was
being held on $300,000 bail.
   In addition to head injuries, Mrs. Wlodarski suffered broken
legs, a broken arm, a dislocated shoulder, a bruised lung and five
broken ribs.
   The woman's husband and two sons living in the home were
sleeping in bedrooms and were not injured.
   Yunker was arrested April 2 in Mokena, near Joliet, after a
police officer saw his vehicle swerving, said Mokena Police Chief
Steve Pollak.
   He was charged with drunken driving, possession of marijuana and
possession of an open bottle of beer. He was scheduled to appear in
court Thursday in that case, Pollak said.
   Orland Park is about 20 miles southwest of downtown Chicago.

<HEAD>South Korean Police Repel Student Attack on U.S. Cultural Center</HEAD>

   Radical students hurled hundreds of
firebombs in an assault against the newly reopened U.S. cultural
center in Kwangju early Tuesday, but fled when police fired volleys
of tear gas, news reports said.
   About 400 radicals screaming anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans raced to within 700 yards of the center before scattering
amid clouds of tear gas, according to Yonhap, the national news
agency.
   No arrests or injuries were reported, and police and news
reports said the building suffered no damage.
   Radicals demand shutdown of the center, which U.S. Ambassador
Donald P. Gregg reopened Monday. It had been closed since May 1989
after radicals attacked it 29 times in 10 years.
   ``This is not just a center but a spy place!'' students yelled
during Tuesday's attack, according to witnesses.
   The students also want shut down a U.S. military facility near
Kwangju, 155 miles south of Seoul.
   On Monday, about 500 students threw rocks and gasoline bombs at
police in a two-hour battle in front of Chosun University in
Kwangju following an anti-U.S. campus rally, Yonhap said, adding
that police reported no injuries or arrests.
   Anti-American sentiment is strong in Kwangju, where residents
say the United States gave tacit approval to the brutal suppression
by a martial-law government in 1980 of a pro-democracy uprising. By
official count, about 200 civilians were killed and more than 1,700
injured. The people in Kwangju say the death toll was much higher.
   The new center lies less than a mile from the old one. U.S.
officials said it can be more easily defended. The old center had
tall buildings around it which gave attackers easy access, they
said.
   In a speech Monday, Gregg said Monday those who oppose the
center are a minority. He denied Washington was involved in the
1980 tragedy, but said the United States should have spoken out
sooner about it instead of remaining silent for nine years.

<TEXT>
   Peace talks between government
officials and rebels who control most of the country were delayed
Monday, and insurgent leaders said they could not get their
representatives to the site.
   Meanwhile, authorities arrested three military officers in 12
grisly murders in the Liberian capital.
   The peace talks were to have begun Monday at a U.S. Embassy
facility in Freetown, capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
   Delegations from the government and Liberian Council of Churches
_ which is mediating the conflict between the forces of President
Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor's insurgent National Patriotic Front
_ arrived Monday in Sierra Leone.
   Rebel sources in Ivory Coast said their delegation would have to
travel more than 600 miles overland to reach Abidjan and make
flight connections to Freetown. The sources said the rebels are
seeking assurances their flight will be safe while crossing
Liberian airspace.
   Even before the talks began, the negotiations threatened to
stall over the rebel demand that Doe step down.
   In Monrovia, the overnight slayings of 12 people _ their hacked
or bullet-ridden bodies were found Monday _ heightened fears in
this already tense city of 400,000 residents.
   Many capital residents are terrified of the prospect of tribal
warfare as the rebels close in on Monrovia.
   A major and two lieutenants of the Liberian army were arrested
in the killings and face court-martials, a Defense Ministry
communique said.
   It said those slain included the mayor of Clay Ashland township
in western Monrovia, a Finance Ministry auditor and the relative of
a politician hacked to death in January.
   The victims, including a teen-age girl, had been abducted last
week by men in uniform.
   Also Monday, 349 Americans who fled Liberia on specially
arranged U.S. government flights _ including at least 170 children
_ landed in Charleston, S.C. The Americans, who said they were
thankful to be out of Liberia, had been urged by the State
Department to leave for safety reasons.
   The Defense Ministry said a special security patrol has been set
up ``to minimize the atrocities going on in and around Monrovia.''
It did not give details concerning the officers' involvement in the
killings or other atrocities.
   About 100 Christians marched through traffic in Monrovia
appealing for an end to tribal killings.
   ``God does not like it when a man's head is cut off. We all want
to wake up in the morning not afraid our necks will be chopped
off,'' the Rev. David Daniels told demonstrators at a downtown
peace march.
   Justice Minister Jenkins Scott condemned Monday's killings. ``It
is absolutely appalling, absolutely appalling,'' he said before
leaving with two other Cabinet ministers and Senate President
Tambakai Jangabar to attend the Freetown peace talks.
   Jangabar, the government delegation's leader, said although he
could not accept rebel demands that Doe resign, ``we are very
optimistic'' about the talks. Doe has been in power in this West
African nation of 2.5 million residents since a violent 1980 coup.
   Jangabar said negotiators hope the talks will ``usher in a
cease-fire and a new government.''
   Doe, in an interview with CBS on Monday, denied charges by
international human rights organizations, Liberian church leaders
and survivors of massacres that his troops were slaughtering
innocent civilians.
   ``Rebels are only doing the killing, doing the destruction,''
Doe said. ``What we've been trying to do is to make sure the army
do not kill innocent people.''
   The rebels launched their fight on Dec. 24 with an invasion from
neighboring Ivory Coast. Since then, they have gained control of
most of the country and the rebellion has turned into a tribal war.
   Government troops are accused of killing hundreds of people of
the Gio and Mano tribes, which have strongly supported the rebels.
   The rebels in turn have been accused of killing dozens of Krahns
and Mandingos in several towns under their control. Doe is a Krahn
and Mandingos have supported the president.
   Two weeks ago, the beheaded bodies of at least 12 men, some
disemboweled, were dumped in the city. Family members identified
them as mainly Gio and Mano soldiers.
   More than 6,000 Gios and Manos are seeking safety and have been
put under the protection of the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   In Akron, Ohio, Bridgestone-Firestone spokesman Bob Troyer said
no fighting had been reported Monday at the U.S.-managed Firestone
plantation about 35 miles outside Monrovia and adjacent to the
international airport.
   ``Our people report today that it's calm. The plantation is so
huge, they can't confirm the news reports that the rebel forces
have control. There are other reports the government has control,''
he said.
   People who fled to the capital said there was heavy fighting in
the rubber plantation's Harbel company town and around Robertsfield
International Airport. Witnesses said it was not clear who
controlled the airport, which has been closed a week.

   Cleanup crews watched anxiously Monday as choppy
seas and stiff winds delayed efforts to unload thousands of gallons
of fuel that threatened to spill from the torn hull of the cruise
ship Bermuda Star.
   The 617-foot vessel was freed Sunday night from a rocky ledge
off Cape Cod, almost 13 hours after it strayed too close to shore
and ran aground in dense fog.
   Divers found a 90-by-2-foot tear on the ship's bottom after it
dropped anchor about 3 miles from the ledge in Buzzards Bay. The
rip exposed four tanks holding more than 110,000 gallons of fuel
oil, the Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard officials confirmed Monday night that 7,500 gallons
of fuel had spilled from the ship's tanks into the bay. Part of
that spill washed ashore at Naushon Island in the bay, the Coast
Guard told a news conference in Providence, R.I.
   The oil splashed the largely unpopulated island with a gooey
swath up to 4 feet wide along a five-mile stretch of shoreline,
said Coast Guard Cmdr. Larry Doyle.
   Another 100,000 gallons of what Doyle described as ``thick,
heavy, dense oil'' may leak into the sea.
   ``It has the potential to be a medium spill,'' Doyle said.
   Doyle said the Coast Guard believed it was more prudent to wait
for the weather to clear than to risk the safety of the repair
crews.
   ``I'm not in any rush to hurry through that,'' he said. ``The
vessel is stable, it's safe.''
   Cleanup of Naushon Island, which lies off the tip of Woods Hole
west of the Cape Cod Canal entrance, was expected to begin Tuesday
morning, Doyle said. Water pressing against the ship kept the oil
inside while anchored, the Coast Guard said. Plans to tow the ship
to a dry dock in New York had to be scrapped until the holes could
be patched and the fuel unloaded.
   ``If you moved the ship now the inertia of the sea would take
away the balancing effect we have, and it would suck the oil right
out of the tear in the ship,'' said Steve Aitkins, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Boston.
   But rain and fog, coupled with winds of 15 to 30 mph and
2-to-4-foot waves, threatened efforts to skim off the spilled fuel
and unload the rest.
   ``It's kind of a Catch-22. The weather can help you as much as
it can hinder you,'' said Randy Krahn, a Coast Guard petty officer
in Providence, R.I. ``The rain can help break up the oil, but too
much makes the clean-up harder.''
   Forecasters predicted the weather would get worse before it got
better, possibly on Tuesday morning.
   Aitkins said the Coast Guard's Atlantic Area Strike Team in
Mobile, Ala., has been notified to be ready to move if the oil
starts to leak and local cleanup crews could not contain it.
   The Panamanian-flagged vessel, on a cruise from New York to Nova
Scotia, went aground in fog Sunday morning. The more than 1,060
passengers and some crew members were ferried to New Bedford in the
evening and taken by bus to hotels in Boston.
   ``There was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise, then
immediately there was an oily smell. We went out on deck and we
could see the oil coming out on the water,'' said passenger Paul
Kelly of Columbia, S.C.
   Tests for drugs and alcohol were performed on key members of the
crew, but the results were not immediately available, the Coast
Guard said.
   David Roddy, senior vice president of Bermuda Star Line Cruises
in Teaneck, N.J., described the ship's captain, Hans Lewing, as
``an excellent, popular captain'' with 20 years of shipping
experience.
   Lewing had been with the company for three years and had a good
record, Roddy said.
   Passengers who had their seven-day excursion abruptly ended
would be offered another week or 10-day cruise or a refund, Roddy
said. The company also would pay their airfare to return home from
Boston, he said.

   Alberto Fujimori, who routed Mario Vargas
Llosa in the presidential runoff, will face a tough task when he
takes over the leadership of a country that at times appears almost
ungovernable.
   On July 28, Fujimori is to become president of a
violence-wracked nation that some analysts have described as a
fragile ship in the midst of a hurricane.
   The abilities of Fujimori, who will turn 52 on inauguration day,
will be tested immediately because Peru has an array of daunting
problems, including its 2,000 percent annual inflation, massive
unemployment, more than a decade of terrorism and protracted drug
trafficking.
   ``I fully accept the challenge of facing the deep crisis
affecting our nation,'' the onetime agricultural engineer told
cheering supporters late Sunday, when his victory was announced.
Peruvians voted earlier the same day.
   But many wonder how he will face the challenge.
   Though he won in a rout, Fujimori will enjoy no grace period
before he must act.
   ``This will be a very short-lived honeymoon,'' said Alfredo
Torres, chief pollster for the independent Apoyo company. ``He will
have to apply adjustment measures almost immediately.''
   Fujimori played on fears of Vargas Llosa's ``economic shock
treatment,'' which the celebrated writer of such novels as ``Aunt
Julia and the Scriptwriter'' said would pull the country out of the
worst crisis of its history.
   Fujimori said the economy could recover with ``gradual''
measures. But he never fully explained what measures those would be.
   Vargas Llosa planned to privatize most of the chronically
inefficient public enterprises. Peru's bloated bureaucracy of over
1 million people would be cut by at least 30 percent, he said.
   In a country where 40 percent of the population lives in extreme
poverty, with a minimum monthly wage of $35 that covers not even
the most basic needs, Vargas Llosa's proposal appeared unbearable.
   Political analysts say most Peruvians concluded that Vargas
Llosa's proposal simply spelled more suffering.
   Fujimori advocates many of the populist measures of discredited,
center-left President Alan Garcia, including price controls and
subsidies.
   But he never said where the money to cover those programs would
come from.
   Peru suspended payment on its $22 billion foreign debt in 1987.
The nation's Treasury is $100 million in the red.
   ``It is a plunge into dark,'' Oiga weekly magazine said in an
editorial Monday. ``We hope we are wrong.''
   Torres explained Fujimori's rising star as ``an illusory search
for a cost-free escape from the crisis.''
   ``This phenomenon comes from the illusion that leaders, not the
ideas they carry out, are to blame for failures,'' Torres said.
``This illusion led many to believe it was Alan Garcia who failed,
not his populism,'' he said.
   Until four months ago Fujimori, whose parents immigrated from
Japan in 1930, was politically unknown.
   In first-round presidential elections April 8 he surged past
seven other candidates to win 24 percent, just three percentage
points behind favored Vargas Llosa. A runoff election was called
because no candidate had captured 50 percent of the vote.
   Unofficial results of Sunday's runoff showed Fujimori with 56
percent of the vote, and Vargas Llosa with 35 percent.
   In Washington, the State Department congratulated the Peruvian
people for what it called ``a victory for Peruvian democracy in the
face of terrorist threats.''
   Peruvians were particularly attracted to Fujimori because of his
Japanese descent. Polls showed Peruvians admire Japan as a
technological power. Throughout the campaign, Fujimori offered to
bring Peru ``technology.''
   But polls showed Fujimori was much less popular among the 60,000
Japanese-Peruvians, who instead favored Vargas Llosa, a novelist
who spent much of the last decade writing abroad.
   Fujimori said he will renegotiate Peru's foreign debt. ``We will
abide by our commitments,'' he said Sunday night. ``We must
reestablish links with the financial community.''
   That is a departure from Garcia's tough stand on foreign credit.
In 1986 Garcia limited debt payments to 10 percent of the nation's
export revenue. A year later Peru stopped paying even that 10
percent.
   Fujimori said he plans to visit the United States and Canada
this month seeking economic aid.
   ``Both countries are friends and could help us implement our
plans,'' he told reporters Monday.
   He said he also will meet with officials at the United Nations
to present a $1.2 billion plan to help Peruvians affected by the
country's worst drought this century.
   Fujimori badly needs financial support to carry out his plans
for agricultural development to counter continuing drug trafficking
and terrorism. Peru is the chief producer of coca leaf, the raw
material of cocaine.
   About 200,000 peasants make their living from growing coca,
which once refined becomes cocaine. Fujimori disagrees with U.S.
officials who favor using military force to eradicate coca
plantations.
   Fujimori must also face another problem _ a decadelong war with
Maoist Shining Path guerrillas that has claimed over 18,000 lives,
including a voter killed on election day when guerrillas blew up a
polling station in Huancayo.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed to meet
with the presidents of the three Baltic republics for the first
time since he branded their independence moves unconstitutional,
spokesmen said Monday.
   Tuesday's scheduled meeting comes amid other new contacts
between the Kremlin and Lithuania _ the Baltic republic that has
taken the boldest moves toward independence and has suffered most.
Moscow's economic blockade against Lithuania enters its third month
next week.
   It also comes one week after Gorbachev returned from the United
States, where congressional leaders made clear they would hold up
approval of a U.S.-Soviet trade deal that Gorbachev wants until the
embargo on Lithuania is lifted.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
he had no specifics on the talks, but ``we welcome dialogue of any
kind. Hopefully, it will lead to a resolution of this issue.''
   The session between Gorbachev and the Baltic presidents could
signal a new Kremlin diplomatic initiative to try to break the
impasse over the republics' independence campaigns.
   Gorbachev has said the republics are free to pursue
independence, but insists they do so in accordance with Soviet
constitutional guidelines that were set down in April and require a
referendum, legislative approval and a wait of up to five years.
   Presidents Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Arnold Ruutel of
Estonia and Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia will meet with Gorbachev, as
well as his Federation Council, a new presidential advisory body,
according to spokesmen from the three republics.
   Also on Tuesday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
will meet with Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to discuss the
economic embargo and her government's halt of the conscription of
Lithuanians into the Soviet army, a Lithuanian spokesman said.
   Landsbergis and Gorbunov met Monday in the Lithuanian city of
Panevezhis to map strategy for the Kremlin session, said Rita
Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian parliament, the Supreme
Council.
   The three presidents formed a united front last month to press
their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years ago
when forcibly annexed by Josef Stalin. The leaders had asked for a
meeting with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev later met with Ruutel and Gorbunov, as well as Mrs.
Prunskiene, but he has remained firm that they must either suspend
or revoke their declarations of independence.
   Although Estonia and Latvia have taken a more cautious path
toward secession, Lithuania declared its independence March 11 and
immediately began passing laws to back up the declaration. Among
those laws was one suspending conscription of Lithuanian youths
into the Soviet army.
   Gorbachev embargoed all oil, most natural gas and other raw
material shipments to Lithuania on April 18 to press the republic
to rescind pro-independence laws. Lithuania has said since then
that it is willing to negotiate on rolling back those laws but
steadfastly refuses to revoke its declaration of independence.
   The Soviet leader declared independence moves by Latvia and
Estonia to be unconstitutional on May 14.
   Algimantas Cekoulis, a Supreme Council consultant who was
accompanying Mrs. Prunskiene to Moscow along with Deputy Prime
Minister Algirdas Brazauskas, said he believed he saw some
``movement'' on the Kremlin's position.
   ``Moscow is sort of trying to find common ground,'' he said.
``The very fact that they (Soviet leaders) are conversing with us
on the basis that we are not revoking the 11th of March
(declaration) is the movement.''
   Cekoulis said that Ryzhkov had spoken of the Soviet Union
suffering ``bruises'' from the own economic blockade _ hurting not
only Lithuania but other republics as well.
   ``If Russia has the bruises from that blockade, that is the
reason for these movements,'' he said. ``They have shot their own
feet.''
   He also disclosed that Yuri Maslyukov, head of the Soviet state
planning commission and a Politburo member, met last week with
Lithuania's economics minister, Vytas Navickas, and discussed what
Lithuania could buy and sell from the Soviet Union on a ruble
basis. The talks covered a wide range of goods, including those
that were cut off by the Kremlin embargo, Cekoulis said.

   About 60,000 supporters of the opposition
alliance took to the streets Monday to protest the projected
victory of the Socialist Party, heir to the Communists who have
controlled the Balkan nation since 1944.
   Crowds rallied outside election headquarters shouting ``Down
with the red mafia!'' after unofficial returns from Sunday's
parliamentary vote showed the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces
in second place.
   Hundreds of cars and taxis, most of them displaying UDF flags,
later crisscrossed downtown Sofia honking their horns. Passers-by
cheered and waved UDF flags.
   Small groups of UDF supporters walked through the city shouting
anti-communist slogans or cheering the alliance.
   The opposition alliance had predicted victory in the nation's
first free balloting in 58 years, and its leaders claimed election
irregularities affected the outcome of voting for the 400
parliamentary seats.
   Official election results were not expected until Tuesday.
   If their victory is confirmed, the Socialists would be the only
ruling party in Eastern Europe to be returned to power in a
multiparty election. The Communists changed their name to
Socialists in April.
   The party has said it would proceedly slowly with reforms. The
opposition alliance favors swift change to a Western-style market
economy to tackle growing inflation, a $10 billion foreign debt and
consumer shortages.
   Plamen Darakchiev, an alliance member and deputy editor in chief
of the party's daily, Demokratsiya, predicted the new political
lineup ``will leave our people polarized in parliament.''
   Opposition chairman Zhelyu Zhelev told the rally the group would
not form a coalition with the ruling party.
   ``In the National Assembly we will be a powerful opposition
faction,'' he said.
   In a nationwide television broadcast Premier Andrei Lukanov
urged ``all public and political forces'' to work together, the
state news agency BTA reported.
   ``There are no losers in the present elections because in the
final reckoning, the victory of democracy is a victory for all,''
he was quoted as saying.
   Only in Sofia, the capital, did the alliance top the Socialists,
according to a forecast by the West German polling group Infas. The
Socialists took the countryside and smaller cities.
   The Infas projections showed the Socialists with 47 percent of
the vote, the opposition alliance with 36 percent and the
mainstream Agrarian Party, once a docile Communist ally, with 8
percent.
   According to Infas, the mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for
Rights and Freedoms will get 5.7 percent and the remaining 38
parties the rest.
   The projections were based on the vote in 250 polling districts.
   Of the 400 parliament seats, 200 will be allocated according to
the percentage of votes each party receives. The remainder will go
to candidates who receive more than 50 percent of the vote.
   A second round of voting is scheduled for Sunday for races in
which no candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote.
   Western observers said the voting was generally free and fair,
although there were scattered incidents of apparent manipulation.
   Michel Aliot-Marie, who headed the European Democratic Union
delegation, said any irregularities did not appear to have affected
the results substantially, the state BTA news agency reported.
   Georgi Spasov, spokesman for the opposition coalition, said
alleged irregularities included illegal campaigning in front of
polling stations.
   ``We are not trying to reject totally the results, but we will
call the attention of the Central Electoral Committee and we shall
seek re-election in some places,'' said Petar Beron, an opposition
official.
   Aliot-Marie attributed the Socialists' lead to the party's
predominance in public life and the early scheduling of the
elections.
   The opposition wanted the elections postponed until fall to
allow more time for parties to organize.
   The Communist Party in Bulgaria has been a strong political
force for nearly a century. It won 20 percent of the vote in the
last free election in 1932 and has ruled since 1944.
   Bulgaria had only a nascent opposition when reform Communists,
including current President Petar Mladenov, ousted longtime
Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov last November.
   The opposition alliance has gained considerable support in
recent months, especially in Sofia, as it pressed the Communists to
accelerate change.

   Two 19-year-old white men on Monday were dealt
the longest possible prison terms for the mob-beating and death of
a young black man who had come to their neighborhood to buy a car.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens handed down the sentences after a
prosecutor called the slaying ``Neanderthal-type behavior'' by the
white mob.
   The Aug. 23 shooting death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins in
Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section inflamed racial passions in the city.
   ``It's a small joy for myself but a great victory for black
people all over the state,'' Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, said
after the sentencings.
   Owens sentenced Joseph Fama, named by prosecutors as the
triggerman, to 32 and two-thirds years to life in prison. He was
convicted of second-degree murder, riot, unlawful imprisonment,
weapons possession and other crimes.
   Defense lawyer David DePetris said he would appeal and added
that he wasn't surprised.
   Earlier, Owens handed Keith Mondello five and one-third to 16
years in prison, plus a $2,000 fine. Mondello, identified as the
ringleader, had been acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges,
but convicted of riot, unlawful imprisonment and discrimination.
   As Owens delivered Fama's sentence in the packed courtroom,
Stewart watched intently and said: ``Yes!''
   Hawkins' mother, Diane Hawkins, put her head on his shoulder and
cried as she looked at Fama.
   ``I'm glad the decision came out like it did ... even though it
won't bring my son back,'' Ms. Hawkins said.
   While supporters of Hawkins' family applauded, members of Fama's
family screamed in Italian and wept.
   ``Not my son! Not my son!'' shouted his mother, Josephine Fama.
   A cousin of Fama shouted, ``Joey! Joey!'' She went toward
Hawkins' family but was restrained by her relatives and court
officers.
   At his sentencing, Mondello declined an offer to address the
court.
   ``Without Mr. Mondello, there would not have been the death of
anyone. It was a senseless death,'' said the judge, of the
trial-level state Supreme Court.
   Hawkins and three friends had gone to Bensonhurst, a primarily
white neighborhood, to look at a used car; a mob of whites, having
been warned by Mondello's ex-girlfriend about ``outsiders,'' set
upon the black teen-agers.
   The judge said that if Mondello had felt threatened, ``All he
had to do was go home and call the police.''
   Instead, he said, the gang ``pursued Mr. Hawkins. If they had
stayed where they were, none of this would have happened.''
   Assistant District Paul Burns, arguing for the maximum term,
called the killing ``a Neanderthal type of behavior.''
   Defense attorney Stephen Murphy told the judge: ``I believe that
the law should rise above public opinion.''
   Later, Murphy said Mondello was ``very distraught'' over his
sentence. But, he added, ``Under the circumstances, with the public
outcry, I felt a sentence like that was going to be given.''
   With the Fama conviction, the city remained calm. But when
Mondello's verdict was delivered, acquitting him of the most
serious charges, crowds of blacks hurled rocks and bottles in
Brooklyn, and several reporters _ black and white _ were roughed up.
   Reacting to the sentences Monday, Bensonhurst residents stressed
that their neighborhood doesn't deserve the reputation the case has
brought it.
   A man who identified himself only as H. Bosque, 47, said the
white mob that attacked Hawkins ``got the wrong guy. But it doesn't
mean everybody's bad here. ... The media talked to the ignorant
people and put them on TV.''
   A delicatessen owner who wouldn't give his name said: ``We can't
wait for the whole thing to be over. We're not racist.''
   Mayor David Dinkins said: ``Now that the criminal justice system
has spoken, we all must join our hearts, heads and hands together
to rid our city of the racism that destroys lives and communities.
... We have had enough of tragedy. Together, we must and we will
move the healing process forward.''
   Opening statements are expected Monday in the trial of John
Vento, another of the white youths charged in the case. Owens set
trial dates in September, November and January for five other
defendants.

<HEAD>Racketeering Trial Begins For New Orleans DA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   District Attorney Harry Connick stayed away
from court Monday as jury selection began in his federal
racketeering trial, saying he was more worried about prosecuting
criminals than defending himself.
   ``The district attorney's office doesn't shut down for this,''
said Connick. ``There's serious work to be done here.''
   Connick said he would miss the preliminary court sessions but
would be present for substantial matters. He is representing
himself, with co-counsel William Wessel.
   Connick could face up to 25 years in prison and $250,000 in
fines if convicted of helping an arrested bookie continue his
gambling operation by giving him back his confiscated records.
   ``This is more than over-reaching. There's no violation here.
There's no crime for me to say I'm innocent of. I will say I have
done nothing wrong,'' Connick said.
   Lawyers from the Justice Department in Washington are handling
the case, but Connick blamed U.S. Attorney John Volz for the
indictment. Volz and Connick have feuded publicly over the years
and Connick has said the charges against him stemmed from a Volz
vendetta.
   Besides Connick, those on trial in U.S. District Court include
actor Paul Burke, who starred in TV's ``The Naked City;'' former
federal prosecutor Patrick Fanning; businessman Wilson Abraham;
convicted bookmaker Walton Aucoin and Aucoin's alleged employees,
Steve Bertolino and William Condon. None of the defendants was in
court Monday.
   Wessel said he expected tapes made of conversations in Connick's
office to be the main thrust of the government's case. Both he and
Connick said the tapes did not contain any ``smoking gun.''
   ``There's nothing there that will even embarrass me, let alone
convict me,'' said Connick.
   Jury selection was expected to take most of the week, with
arguments beginning Monday. The trial is expected to last four to
five weeks.
   The father of jazz musician Harry Connick Jr., Connick has been
district attorney in New Orleans since 1973.
   ``I don't know if this will hurt me,'' Connick, who is seeking
re-election in October, said of the trial. ``I depend entirely on
the public. I would hope they would understand what's happening
here and have faith in the fact that I've been a public servant
most of my adult life.''
   The indictment accused Aucoin, Bertolino and Condon of owning
and conducting a New Orleans-based illegal interstate gambling
operation that netted up to $2,000 a day.
   Fanning, Abraham and Burke were charged with aiding the
operation by helping Connick concoct an excuse for returning the
seized records Aucoin needed to keep it going. Aucoin was arrested
in December 1988.
   Connick has said that in returning the records, he was acting in
accordance with state criminal procedures, which let defendants see
evidence against them.
   Two others indicted in the case pleaded guilty last week to
helping conduct an illegal gambling business: Aucoin's daughter,
Darlene Peake, and Iris Ethridge, a bank employee who handled
Aucoin's account at a suburban bank.
   Federal prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of
racketeering in exchange for the women's cooperation. A perjury
charge against Ms. Ethridge also will be dropped, attorneys said.

<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edna McRae, a ballet teacher who earned
national recognition for her work for the Joffrey Ballet Company
and with child dancers, has died. She was 88.
   Miss McRae died Thursday at the senior citizens' residence where
she lived in this Chicago suburb.
   The Chicago native studied in London and Paris before opening a
ballet school in Chicago in 1925. The school became one of the
places traveling dance companies would take lessons when in the
area.
   After retiring in 1964, she directed the New York-based Joffrey
Ballet Company's West Coast scholarship courses. She was also
associate director in charge of children for the annual
``Nutcracker'' production at Chicago's Arie Crown Theatre for seven
years until 1973.
   ``She really worked people very, very hard,'' said Sue Ellen
Krause, who studied ballet and tap with Miss McRae for eight years.
``She made you do your personal best at all times.''
   Speaking of her youngest students in 1973, Miss McRae said, ``As
a general group, they are just children backstage with all the
deviltry and mischievousness of kids. But when they enter the door
of the stage area, strangely enough they become professionals.''
   Miss McRae is survived by a niece. A memorial service was
scheduled for June 23 in Chicago's Newberry Library.

   A hunger striker reported progress in
talks with the government Monday on setting up independent TV
stations in Romania.
   Hundreds of steel-helmeted paramilitary police carrying AK-47
rifles pushed back about 500 anti-communist demonstrators trying to
get near the government headquarters building where strikers and
officials were holding talks on freedom of the press.
   Some of the demonstrators were beaten with clubs but no injuries
or arrests were reported.
   Nineteen hunger strikers in University Square in downtown
Bucharest, backed by hundreds of other Romanians, have sought since
April 22 to open a dialogue with the government. They are demanding
a freeing of the news media and a 10-year ban on former communists
holding public office.
   Three representatives of the hunger strikers attended talks with
government officials Monday and signed a protocol in which they
said they would stop fasting if the government pledged in writing
to allow private television stations to be established.
   Government officials told the fasters their demands came under
the jurisdiction of Parliament, but for the first time pledged to
support setting up independent TV stations, sources at the talks
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Ovidiu Poclitaru, 48, one of the three hunger-striker
representatives at the talks, described the dialogue as ``rich.''
   ``It is great to know now that we can stop our protest and that
they listened to us with so much concern,'' he told reporters.
   Hundreds of protesters marched Monday from University Square to
Victory Square, where they shouted ``The only solution is another
revolution!'' _ an allusion to the December revolution that toppled
the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and communism in Romania.
   After police roughly intervened, the protesters' number swelled
to about 1,000 but soon dwindled.
   ``Why do you want to get rid of us? We only want to put
communism in the same grave with Ceausescu,'' housewife Florica Tia
told the major commanding the police.
   A government statement said demonstrators tried ``to storm the
government building'' and that police were called ``to defend
Romania's government.''

<TEXT>
   Federal agents Monday charged 62 Chinese
citizens with being illegal aliens smuggled into the country as
part of a massive scheme linked to deposed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Two alleged ringleaders also were arrested as a result of the
probe into what federal agents say appears to have been a
multimillion-dollar alien-smuggling operation run by officials
linked to Noriega.
   While prosecutors have no firm evidence tying Noriega or his
lieutenants to the ring, ``there's a real strong possibility'' they
were involved, said U.S. Customs Agent Gary Small. Noriega is
awaiting trial on drug charges in Florida.
   Immigration officials said last week that tens of thousands of
immigrants had paid Noriega millions of dollars to use his nation
an illegal gateway to the United States and Canada. U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization officials said authorities had
enough evidence to indict Noriega, but didn't want to interfere
with the drug case.
   The alien-smuggling operation hit Monday charged Chinese
citizens $10,000 to $20,000 each to get into the United States,
said Customs and INS officials.
   Authorities said the operation could have netted its organizers
more than $200 million.
   An estimated 95,000 Chinese live in Panama, and about 35,000
want to come to the United States, said INS Agent Henry Berwald.
   The 62, arrested in two groups after landing at the airport in
this southern Alabama on Monday and Saturday, were believed to have
been headed for Mobile, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Atlanta,
Detroit and other major cities.
   Small said Alfonso Mock-Castillo, a Panamanian of Chinese
descent, approached undercover Customs agents some time ago seeking
help in smuggling people into the United States.
   He said Mock-Castillo claimed to have been in the
alien-smuggling business for seven years.
   While most of the Chinese trying to get into the United States
from Panama are refugees who left their homeland with few
possessions and little money, families pooled cash to pay to get
members in one at a time, Small said.
   Berwald said a Grumman G-1 turboprop plane carrying 31 Chinese
from Panama landed in Fairhope around noon Monday. Another 31
Chinese had been intercepted after landing Saturday and were
detained at a motel.
   Mock was arrested when he arrived on the Monday flight,
authorities said.
   Rosana Butcher, who allegedly collected the payments, was
arrested Monday outside the Mobile office of the U.S. Border
Patrol, where she was tricked into going, said Berwald.
   Both Mock-Castillo and Ms. Butcher were charged with conspiracy
and bringing in illegal aliens, said Small.
   The 62 Chinese were accused of being illegal aliens and formally
charged Monday at the airport, Berwald said. Most were being taken
to a federal detention facility in El Paso, Texas, he said.
   Small said officials believed the two flights were the first
into Alabama involving the alleged smuggling operation.
   He said smugglers of all types think south Alabama is ``a nice
place to do business.''
   ``You've got all the (drug) interdiction efforts over in Miami
... and they don't realize we're doing the same thing here. They
think this is a more laid-back, relaxed place,'' he said. ``It
isn't.''

   University of Utah President Chase N.
Peterson, his administration marred by a $500,000 transfer of funds
to a cold fusion research program, announced Monday he will retire
next year.
   The announcement at a campus news conference followed last
week's Academic Senate resolution questioning Peterson's ability to
administer the affairs of the 23,543-student university in light of
the furor over the money transfer.
   However, Peterson said he had no intention of resigning under
pressure from ``one of the important constituency groups I serve
... I still have goals to consolidate and advance before I step
down from this responsibility.''
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the ``period of time I can
effectively provide leadership is nearing an end.''
   ``It is my intention to dedicate the next year to accomplishing
my remaining goals and to position this university for new
leadership following the 1990-91 academic year,'' he said.
   Institutional Council Chairman James S. Jardine accepted
Peterson's decision, saying the council ``reluctantly'' supported
it.
   ``We recognize and acknowledge the great leadership, energy,
dedication and devotion'' which Peterson and his wife, Grethe, have
provided the university, Jardine said. He also praised the couple's
contributions involving higher education and public issues in Utah.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter said Peterson's last year at the university
would be ``productive and fruitful.''
   Peterson, 60, was the school's vice president for health
sciences when surgeons completed the first artificial heart implant
in 1982 on Seattle-area dentist Barney Clark, who died after 112
days on the device.
   He became the university's 11th president in 1983, succeeding
David P. Gardner.
   The controversy over the National Cold Fusion Institute erupted
late last month when it became known the $500,000 donation,
characterized as an ``anonymous,'' outside gift, actually was the
result of a Peterson-authorized transfer of money from the school's
Research Foundation.
   He had come under sharp criticism twice before in the past 15
months, first for the school's 1989 announcement of a breakthrough
in the quest for a usable source of fusion energy and then for his
handling of a $15 million donation that later was returned.
   Chemist B. Stanley Pons of the university and British colleague
Martin Fleischmann announced in March 1989 that they had achieved a
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a table-top experiment.
   Despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today, the
Utah Legislature appropriated $5 million to establish the National
Cold Fusion Institute in the school's research park and to protect
the state's patent rights.
   The center has sought to raise funds from the federal government
and private corporations with limited success. A Department of
Energy panel recommended against government funding, and the only
confirmed contribution was $50,000 from Utah Power &amp; Light Co. in
March.
   Pons said he was grateful for Peterson's support.
   ``He made a strong effort to see it through. We regret that it
is an issue in his retirement decision,'' Pons said. ``We still
know that we are right, and we are sure that soon he will be able
to list cold fusion as one of the positive accomplishments by the
University of Utah.''
   In June, Salt Lake medical equipment manufacturer James L.
Sorenson donated $15 million in pharmaceutical stock to the
university with the understanding the medical school and hospital
would be renamed in his honor.
   Peterson was forced to return the money after protests from
doctors, faculty and students.

   State election officials ordered a recount
Monday to determine who won the Democratic nomination for governor
because the margin in unofficial primary returns was too narrow.
   The recount of the seven-way race, mandated by state law, will
begin Wednesday, said Secretary of State Allen Beermann. He said it
could be June 20 or later before the board reconvenes to certify
the results.
   Unofficial returns of the May 15 primary showed attorney Ben
Nelson in first place with 44,556 votes and a 41-vote lead over his
nearest challenger, Bill Hoppner. Hoppner, a former aide to U.S.
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., had 44,515 votes.
   Because the margin between first and second place amounted to
less than 1 percent of the front-runner's total, it forced an
automatic recount. It had been known for several weeks that a
recount would be ordered; Monday was the election board's regularly
scheduled meeting.
   The recount will be done by hand in 70 counties that still use
paper ballots, and by machine in the other 23, Beermann said.
   The Democratic nominee will challenge incumbent Gov. Kay Orr,
the nation's first Republican woman elected governor, who seeks a
second, four-year term.
   Mrs. Orr chairs the elections board, the Board of Canvassers,
and voted for the recount, as did the other three members present.
One member was absent.
   Hoppner supporters hope ballots that may have gone uncounted in
Lancaster County, where their candidate did particularly well, will
help. They hope that ballots mistakenly marked with ball-point pens
instead of pencils, and thus not read by electronic scanning
devices, will fall largely into Hoppner's column.
   The other Democratic candidates are: former Omaha Mayor Mike
Boyle; Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris; former University of Nebraska
Regent Robert Prokop; former state Sen. Don Eret, and Robb Nimic.

   A top aide of U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher will personally inspect retail store shelves in Seoul
next week in connection with reports that South Korea is reviving
restrictions against imports, Commerce Department officials said
Monday.
   Mosbacher told members of a high-level South Korean trade
delegation he ``hopes that the reports are not true,'' but he is
asking his department counselor, Wayne Berman, to make a ``seeing
is believing'' check into stores during a previously planned
journey to Seoul, said Commerce spokeswoman Pat Woodward.
   Former Trade Minister Kum Jin-ho, leader of the visiting
mission, acknowledged there were fewer luxury goods in some
department stores, but denied it was the result of government
policy.
   Some stores were responding to austerity demands of Korean
women's groups and consumer organizations, but this affected ``a
very small portion'' of the retail trade, he said. ``You will see a
flood of imported goods, not only from the United States but from
every country in the world,'' Kum added to reporters.
   Aides quoted Mosbacher as telling the visitors that if the
government is intervening to discourage sale of imported goods,
that ``would be a genuine problem that has to be dealt with,'' and
Berman would seek the facts during his visit to address a
U.S.-Korean business conference next week.
   They quoted Kum as telling Mosbacher the matter had been
exaggerated by media coverage, that ``the press over-reacted.''
   Kum also talked about the issue at a ceremony announcing Korean
Air's purchase of 23 Boeing 747-400 jetliners for $4.8 billion in
one of the largest orders ever placed with the U.S. aerospace
company.
   Korean consumer groups, he said, were objecting to imported
luxury furniture and glassware at a time when their country's
global trade surplus was shrinking.
   While running a surplus with the United States, South Korea
reportedly showed a $1.2 billion-dollar global deficit the first
quarter of this year. Ambassador Park Tong-jin said the plane order
represented ``a sincere effort to reduce'' the surplus with America.
   James W. Booth, executive vice president of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Korea, referred to ``the return of protectionism to
Korea'' in a dispatch from Seoul in Monday's Boston Globe. The
dispatch said Gucci, Lanvin, Burberry and Bally boutiques ``have
mysteriously closed'' and department stores no longer stock
imported wines, women's wear or neckties.
   A spokesman of Lucky-Goldstar, one of the country's largest
trading companies, was quoted as saying the government apparently
decided to halt luxury imports ``because they don't want rich
people spending more than poor people.''

<HEAD>Mulroney Seeks Approval of Meech Lake Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Monday that
Canada should proceed with the ratification by June 23 of the Meech
Lake constitutional accord, despite some province's fears about the
special status afforded Quebec.
   ``It is clear there are serious misunderstandings in this
country we cannot afford to ignore,'' he told the House of Commons
in his first speech since the 11 ``first ministers'' _ Mulroney and
the 10 provincial premiers _ reached a tentative deal over the
weekend to ratify the controversial accord.
   Under the deal, holdout provinces Newfoundland, Manitoba and New
Brunswick will try to pass Meech Lake before June 23, when by law
it is due to expire. Under Meech Lake, Quebec, a largely
French-speaking province with 6.7 million of Canada's 25 million
population, would be recognized as a distinct society. Other
amendments include broadening the powers of all provinces, senate
reform and a ``Canada clause'' regarding aboriginals.
   After seven rancorous days of private talks convened at the
behest of Mulroney, the ministers came up with a package of
agreements that would allow the accord to be approved.
   Premier Clyde Wells of Newfoundland said Monday his legislature
will hold a free vote on the accord, with deputies voting their
conscience and not by party dictates. He said he would have
preferred a full referendum of his province's 550,000-plus
residents.
   Wells believes Meech Lake injures the tradition of equality
among provinces and weakens the federal state.
   A legislative vote was seen as good news for Meech Lake
supporters because it would be faster than a referendum and would
hold more potential for approval than a referendum.
   Manitoba and New Brunswick legislatures are expected to approve
Meech Lake. Premiers Robert Bourassa of Quebec and David Peterson
of Ontario on Monday publicly opposed extending the June 23
deadline Monday _ helping to scuttle any referendum plans by Wells
as being too time-consuming.
   The 3-year-old accord would make Quebec a full supporter of the
1982 Constitution, which the province refused to sign because it
failed to distinguish Quebec as a ``distinct society.''

   The ruling party won more than 99 percent
of the 3,774 seats contested in municipal councils in nationwide
elections boycotted by opposition parties, the government said
Monday.
   Only a few independent candidates challenged the Constitutional
Democratic Rally party in Sunday's elections and abstention was the
only way for most of the 1.7 million voters to express discontent
with President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali's government.
   Independent candidates captured only 34 of the 3,774 contested
seats.
   The official turnout was 78.3 percent, Interior Minister
Abdelhamid Escheikh said at a news conference. He said the election
showed the government's commitment toward establishing a multiparty
democracy.
   The Interior Ministry said independents won 12 of their seats in
Monastir, the birthplace of deposed President Habib Bourguiba. The
former leader, ousted in 1987 by Ben Ali after three decades in
power, was the first person to vote in Monastir on Sunday. Ben Ali
was serving as prime minister at the time of the ouster.
   Two Tunis newspapers reported Monday that independent candidates
had accused supporters of the ruling party of electoral abuses in
some regions.
   The election boycott was endorsed by officially recognized
left-wing and right-wing parties. The Islamic fundamentalist
An-Nahda group was banned from the elections.
   In the last legislative elections in 1988, the ruling party won
every seat in the national assembly. Opposition parties accused the
party of having abused its control of state funds, transport and
mass media.
   Municipal and regional elections will be held Tuesday in
neighboring Algeria in the first multiparty challenge to the that
nation's ruling National Salvation Front.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules DOE Must Pay $250,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ordered the Department
of Energy to pay $250,000 to the state of Ohio and the U.S.
Treasury in a case involving a troubled nuclear weapons plant.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court
ruling that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the
Clean Air Act don't shield the DOE from liability because Congress
waived sovereign immunity for civil actions under both statutes.
   The Energy Department owns the Feed Materials Production Center
18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, which was used from 1952 until
last year to process uranium for nuclear weapons. The plant has
been idle since last year to allow cleanup of the site.
   Area residents already have won a $78 million settlement from
the DOE for their claim that their health may be endangered and
their property value diminished because of their closeness to the
site.
   The state of Ohio sued the Energy Department in 1986, requesting
fines for improper hazardous waste disposal and release of
radioactive materials at the plant.
   U.S. District Court in Cincinnati never got to address whether
the Energy Department and its contractors should be liable for
improperly disposing hazardous waste or polluting the air or water.
   The parties in the case agreed in December 1988 to a settlement
in which DOE would pay up to $1 million. Of that amount, $750,000
was to be paid to Ohio, with $250,000 riding on the appeal of the
sovereign immunity issue.
   Under Monday's ruling, the DOE will have to pay the remaining
$250,000 of the settlement, half to Ohio and half to the federal
treasury.
   Hazardous wastes dating from the World War II Manhattan Project
are stored at Fernald. A citizen watchdog group says many barrels
storing hazardous and chemical wastes are rusting and leaking.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is supervising the
cleanup of the site, which is expected to take up to 50 years.
   Judge Boyce F. Martin Jr. wrote the opinion of the court, in
which Judge Nathaniel R. Jones concurred. Judge Ralph B. Guy Jr.
wrote a dissenting opinion.
   Ohio Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. called Monday's
ruling ``another victory for Ohio and its citizens in what has
often been a complex and frustrating battle with the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Federal Department of Justice.''
   Calls to the DOE seeking comment were not returned.

   Seven in 10 Americans say they would ban
disposable diapers to protect the environment, and even more would
outlaw the plastic foam flotsam of fast-food restaurants, a survey
found.
   The Media General-Associated Press survey found that most
Americans want to elect statewide supercops to take on polluters.
And they favor prohibiting cancer-causing pesticides and excessive
product packaging.
   The poll found strong support for an array of other strict
environmental laws. Of those who live in neighborhoods where
recycling is not mandatory, nine in 10 supported such a requirement.
   Nearly 70 percent favored election of a state environmental
sheriff, a proposal that comes before California voters in a
November referendum dubbed ``Big Green.'' Other steps in that
measure also won wide backing in the poll.

   In the arid West, where water is more
valuable than gold, the Wind River Indian Reservation considers
itself awash in wealth.
   The Indians last year won rights to much of the water in
west-central Wyoming. Now their destiny is no longer entirely in
the hands of the white man, who relegated them to the 2.5
million-acre reservation in the mid-1800s.
   ``Look how many years we've taken the back seat to everything,''
says Burton Hutchinson, Northern Arapaho tribal chairman. ``We're
the ones in the driver's seat now. It feels good. Real good. Real
nice.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that an 1868 treaty gave
the Northern Arapahos and Shoshones priority rights to 500,000
acre-feet of water from the Wind River _ roughly twice what the
6,000 Indians previously controlled. An acre-foot is enough to
cover an acre to a depth of one foot.

   Activists on both sides of the abortion
issue see Iowa's gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races as a ``test
tube'' in which to develop campaign strategies that can be put to
work elsewhere.
   The dividing lines sharpened last week when Democrats nominated
pro-choice House Speaker Don Avenson to run against first-term
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who opposes abortion.
   The state's Senate race also matches up candidates on opposing
sides of the abortion issue. Anti-abortion Republican Rep. Tom
Tauke is hoping to oust Sen. Tom Harkin, who is pro-choice on
abortion.
   ``Iowa is one of the most important states in terms of
gubernatorial races and Senate races,'' said Loretta Ucelli of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, or NARAL. ``The stakes are
very high there.''

   It's springtime in Kashmir, and there are
roses everywhere.
   Bigger than peonies, blush-pink roses bloom in regal splendor in
the meticulously tended 17th century Mogul gardens. Neatly pruned
and staked, white and yellow roses invoke the image of past
prosperity outside the shuttered tourist hotels facing Dal Lake.
   Kashmir, crossroads of the ancient world, way station on the old
``Silk Road'' from the Near East to the Far East, was once a
paradise.
   Today it is an armed camp.
   Employees of the state government, whose association with Indian
authority is enough to make them targets for the guns of
independence-minded Kashmiris, are escorted by armed guards from
barricaded hostels inside the compound of the no-longer-needed
tourist office to barricaded office buildings.
   In the Mogul gardens overlooking the lake, the only people in
sight are two elderly gardeners and two young soldiers taking a
break from trying to contain the burgeoning Moslem revolt.
   Down in the city, red roses are shredded petal by petal and
scattered on fresh graves. The fragrance of the roses wafts across
these ``martyrs' cemeteries'' created for victims of the struggle
between Moslem separatists and the government of India, which is
officially secular but dominated by Hindus.
   Indian soldiers and paramilitary police guard Srinagar's main
streets and every bridge over the Jhelum River, which snakes
through the city of 1 million people.
   By day, parts of Srinagar assume an air of near-normality. Small
groceries and butcher shops open. Pedestrians, bicycles, horse
carts, minibuses and cars ply the streets.
   By night, when curfew is imposed as it has been since winter,
Srinagar is a ghost town.
   Streets start emptying an hour before the usual 6 p.m. deadline.
People check their watches to see how much time they have to get
home, or at least out of sight of the patrols.
   Packs of shaggy black and brown dogs roam the streets with their
sturdy puppies, rested after a day of lolling in the sun. A single
howl starts a canine chorus that reverberates across the city.
   Out on Dal Lake and adjacent Nageen Lake, soldiers and dogs are
rarely heard. About 1,200 houseboats are licensed to take paying
guests, but hardly any tourists arrive these days.
   Moonlight shimmers across the water. Ducks quack once in a while.
   The occasional dip of an oar ripples the lake's glassy surface.
Houseboat dwellers and their small, arrowlike boats called
``shikaras'' are not bound by the curfew if they stay away from
shore.
   Kashmir, whose name was Anglicized by British colonial rulers to
describe the ``cashmere'' wool of the shawls and carpets still
woven here, has long been synomymous with beauty.
   Over the centuries, followers of most of the world's great
religions came here: Moslems, now the majority; Hindus, who
predominate elsewhere in India; Buddhists, who still have a few
remote monasteries in Kashmir; Christians, who operate a few
schools, and Jews, whose last known descendants departed for Israel
or Indian cities in the past decade.
   One legend says Moses, a patriarch of the Jewish, Christian and
Islamic faiths, passed this way.
   Another holds that Jesus did not die on the cross, but came to
Kashmir, lived to the age of 80 and was buried as ``Yuz Asaf'' in a
tomb that still can be seen in the center of Srinagar. A third says
the prophet Mohammed also sojourned in Kashmir.
   Mogul emperors, fresh from spreading Islam across the Hindu
lands of India, sought respite in Kashmir, building magnificent
forts and terraced gardens of geometrical precision. Later, the
British would move their women and children from the summertime
dust and heat of the plains to the cool, clean air of the Himalayan
lakes and hills.
   By the 1980s, Kashmir attracted 600,000 tourists a year,
including about 50,000 foreigners. Indian families and honeymooners
came as the growing middle class found time and money to visit a
place that seemed a bit foreign but didn't require a passport or
foreign currency, which was hard to come by.
   In 1989, as the militant Moslem movement spun into one of its
periodic cycles of bombings and killings, the number of visitors
dropped by one-third.
   Tourists are so rare this year that word races through the city
when an outsider is spotted, especially one who pauses to admire
the roses.

   The counting problems and controversies that have beset the 1990
census are only a preview of the political struggle to come.
Republicans see redistricting as the crucial ingredient in their
effort to become competitive for control of the House, Democratic
for 36 years.
   The GOP lost its first 1990 redistricting fight a week ago, when
voters in California overwhelmingly rejected a pair of ballot
initiatives that would have set stringent rules for drawing
congressional and legislative districts, curbing the power of the
state legislature, currently Democratic.
   Both measures would have set guidelines that Republicans said
would end gerrymandering, the drawing of district lines tailored to
one party's advantage. One would have required a two-thirds vote of
the legislature to approve any redistricting plan. The other would
have taken district design away from the legislature and put it in
the hands of a special commission.
   They were rejected by margins of about 2-1 in the June 5
primary, leaving the shape of districts to be drawn the
old-fashioned way: by the legislature and the new governor to be
elected in November.
   Republicans had pushed the ballot issues; President Bush urged
their approval and helped raise funds to support them during two
campaign swings to California. Democrats pushed harder and spent
more, with a television campaign said to have cost more than $5
million. The fact that there were rival Republican proposals didn't
help on measures most voters said they didn't know much about.
   The numbers and the history of redistricting in California point
to the national stakes that will be settled there over the next
year. California probably will gain seven House seats, to a total
of 52, to reflect its increased population. There are now 28
Democrats and 17 Republicans in the state's House delegation.
   A decade ago, before new districts were drawn, California
Democrats held only one seat more than Republicans. After
redistricting, they widened the margin to 11.
   Republicans cite that as a prime example of the way they say
districts have been rigged against them. One of their major goals
in the 1992 elections is to gain at least veto power over state
redistricting plans. That means electing governors, or gaining
control in at least one branch of the state legislature, since any
one of the three can block the other two and force a deal.
   To that end, the Republicans are using national campaign
techniques in state legislative campaigns in close, target states.
That's something the Democrats started doing 20 years ago.
   Thirty-six states will be electing governors in 1990; Democrats
now outnumber Republican governors, 29 to 21.
   And the Democrats hold an even wider margin in legislative
control; they have two-house majorities in 29 states, Republicans
in only 8, with others divided.
   The census results, to be announced by the end of the year,
probably will shift about a dozen House seats, most of them from
the Democratic, industrial Northeast and upper Midwest to the Sun
Belt states where Republicans claim growing strength.
   The national and state counts, and the apportionment of the 435
House seats begin the process mandated by the Constitution. Next
spring, the Census Bureau will deliver detailed numbers, down to
the neighborhood, to be used in drawing the lines for new
congressional and legislative districts.
   Even that comes with a complication; there could be a census
adjustment in the summer of 1991, in order to produce population
numbers more accurate than the head count.
   Big cities, which claim their minorities and poor are
undercounted, want the adjustment and went to court to force it.
The adjustment decision won't be made until some time next year.
   Should there be an adjustment, there will be two sets of numbers
_ making painfully clear who won and who lost politically. Winners
will get right down to redistricting. Losers will get right down to
the federal courthouse.
   Republican strategy is to raise a variety of redistricting
issues, looking for one that would lead ultimately to a clear
Supreme Court ruling against gerrymandering, while blocking
Democratic district blueprints with their lawsuits.
   Democrats will do the same thing where they are confronted with
GOP plans. Interest groups will be in court, too. In the age of the
personal computer, everybody involved can become an instant expert
with a rival district plan.
   After the last census, there were court challenges against
redistricting plans in 47 of the 50 states. This time it probably
will be a sweep.

<HEAD>Are Less People Watching TV?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Network executives are having a cow, dude,
but it's not over Fox Broadcasting Co. and Bart Simpson stealing
viewers from the Big Three.
   If the A.C. Nielsen Co. is correct, about 2 million American
households have simply turned off the boob tube.
   Nielsen offers no explanation for this drastic and unprecedented
decline, leading some network executives to snidely note that
perhaps the missing viewers will one day be found with all those
socks that vanish in the dryer.
   The brass at ABC, CBS and NBC say they just don't believe that
millions of people, all of a sudden, have stopped watching
television.
   Turned to cable, yes. Rented a video, OK. Flipped to ``The
Simpsons'' on upstart Fox, oh, all right. But switched off the set
entirely?
   ``The use of the set has been a very, very predictable
behavior,'' said Alan Wurtzel, ABC's research chief. ``All of a
sudden, the rug has been pulled out and the behavior has been
changed and no one can explain why.
   ``Nielsen has lost people they can't account for,'' Wurtzel
said. ``According to them, they have simply gone away.''
   To realize why Nielsen's figures have turned TV land on its ear
is to understand how the company's rating system is the foundation
upon which the television industry is built.
   ``People meters'' installed in 4,000 homes across the country
provide the ratings that help decide which shows make it and which
get yanked. But more importantly, the Nielsen numbers provide the
base for what networks charge advertisers for commercial time.
   And these are the Nielsen figures for the first quarter of this
year that have caused such a stir:
   Seemingly overnight, overall television viewing is down 4
percent (as compared to the same period in 1989).
   And in prime-time audiences of women between the ages of 18 and
49 (crucial to advertisers because this group buys most consumer
goods), viewership is down nearly 10 percent.
   Here is where the controversy begins. The networks say the
Nielsen ``people meter'' system, used nationally since 1987, is
fundamentally flawed and has produced incorrect numbers.
   As proof of that alleged inaccuracy, the networks point to
localized ratings compiled during the May sweeps season, which
showed a much lower drop-off than the national people meter survey.
   ``We think all of these things are related to the people
meter,'' Wurtzel said. ``Every time you turn the channel, you've
got to punch this button. We're asking people to do something that
is far beyond what is reasonable.''
   Wurtzel and his counterparts at NBC and CBS blame the apparent
drop-off in viewers on ``fatigue.'' Nielsen families are just plain
pooped when it comes to punching a button every time they switch
the dial, the network folks say.
   Before 1987, Nielsen's national survey relied on boxes that
required no viewer effort. The old system told what was on the
tube, but not who was watching it. The people meter is designed to
show which family member is viewing.
   Nielsen stands behind its numbers, saying it has checked and
rechecked the people meters and found them to be accurate.
   ``There truly was a decline in the first quarter,'' said Nielsen
spokeswoman Jo LaVerde. ``It is probably the largest drop we have
ever seen. There has been a decline in homes using television, but
we have really not stated any conclusions on where they have gone.''
   And here's where the bottom line comes in: ABC, CBS and NBC say
they cannot sell advertising for their fall schedules based on
ratings that are incorrect.
   NBC alone has said it will lose $200 million this year in
advertising revenue, at least half of it directly caused by the
drop in Nielsen figures.
   ABC added gasoline to the fire two weeks ago by announcing it
had come up with its own way of counting viewers for the purpose of
selling commercial time.
   CBS and NBC followed suit by saying they, too, might revamp
advertising formulas. This provides no small threat to Nielsen,
which receives $20 million annually from each network, according to
a Big Three executive who refused to be quoted by name.
   Only Fox has said it will continue to use the traditional
strategy of ratings guarantees during this month's ``up front''
sales season.
   In a nutshell, advertisers buy time on the fall schedule this
month based on a network's guarantee to provide a certain number of
viewers. If a program draws less than the promised number, the
advertiser is given free ``make good'' time on another show.
   If the Nielsen figures continue to drop, or at the very least,
fluctuate widely, the Big Three stand to collectively lose hundreds
of millions in advertising revenues.
   Fox can afford to keep the old system. Nielsen figures show the
alternative network's audience grew by 20 percent last year.

   Confidence isn't a problem for English
singer John Wesley Harding. This is, after all, a 24-year-old who's
written updates of the Rolling Stones' ``Sympathy for the Devil''
and the Everly Brothers' ``Cathy's Clown'' on his debut album.
   Identity, however, might not be such a sure thing.
   ``Bob Dylan is my father,'' sings the man who takes his stage
name from Dylan's 1968 album. ``Joan Baez is my mother. And I am
their bastard son.''
   It's a joke, of course. Harding turns the tables on fans who
love to spot the influences in a musician's work. His debut album,
``Here Comes the Groom,'' is a feast of word games and
sound-alikes, as well as a showcase for a promising beginner.
   ``I hate people who claim that they're not influenced by people
they're obviously influenced by _ like the Jesus and Mary Chain and
the Velvet Underground. I mean, give me a break,'' said the
precocious young singer.
   ``I decided to be completely the opposite. To be playful, I
claimed that Bob Dylan is my father and Joan Baez is my mother,
which is obviously ridiculous.''
   The real-life Wesley Harding Stace is quick to slyly note that
Dylan and Baez were touring England together the year he was born
in Hastings. Growing up, Stace wanted to be a sportswriter. He
studied English Literature at Cambridge University, writing a
doctoral dissertation on the role of Jimmy Stewart in American
films.
   He also wrote plays, short stories and songs. Armed with an
acoustic guitar, he regularly performed his songs and others in
pubs around Cambridge and, in true music business fashion, was
``discovered'' there.
   There was little calculation in the name change, he said. Stace
took the name John Wesley Harding because his solo performances
were ``kind of Dylan-y.''
   ``I think changing your name is quite cool because nobody seems
to do it right now,'' he said. ``Everybody worries about integrity.
I couldn't imagine Tracy Chapman changing her name.''
   Harding was signed to the independent British label Demon
Records and put out his first record in 1988.
   Which brings up another comparison. Demon is Elvis Costello's
label. So is Warner Bros., home of Harding's U.S. debut. So is
Plangent Visions Music, Harding's song publishing company.
Two-thirds of Costello's old backup band, the Attractions, play on
Harding's album. And, in spots, Harding's voice sounds chillingly
like Costello's.
   Coincidence? Harding thinks so.
   ``Critics have got to do it. They've got to put you somewhere,''
he said. ``It's like saying to a critic, `describe John Wesley
Harding without making reference to Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello,
Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and the Byrds.' It's like saying describe
a tennis ball without saying it's round or it's a ball. I don't
particularly object to it.
   ``But it's very foolhardy in a way. Clearly the songs that I
write are nothing like Elvis Costello songs.''
   Indeed, such lines as ``if there's a nuclear winter, at least it
will snow,'' show a sense of humor Costello took a while to reveal.
   ``He writes great songs and they're cruel, they're untender,''
he said. ``They're inhumane sometimes. ... My songs are very
gentle, optimistic. They're meant to be very charming. I can't see
any similarity in the lyrical outlook whatsoever.''
   Don't look for a lyric sheet on the album, even though words
tumble out of Harding's mouth as fast as he can take a breath.
   ``I used to buy John Hiatt albums and by the time I got back to
the house I read all the lyrics and it ruined the album for me,''
he said. ``My big thing is the shape of the song. I don't want you
to know where the song is going to end, or where the bridge is.
It's a little bit of oral drama.''
   Harding's song, ``The Devil in Me,'' is a sampling of the
world's ills, from war to acid rain. ``Put it down to the devil in
me,'' he sings as the narrator for those responsible.
   Harding calls it a ``folk sample'' of ``Sympathy for the
Devil.'' He said he wanted to do a politically responsible version
of the ``amoral'' Rolling Stones song.
   The song ``Cathy's New Clown'' refers to the Everly Brothers
classic only with a brief touch of the melody during the fadeout.
Harding wanted to update the emotions expressed in the nearly
30-year-old song.
   The tunes on Harding's solo album are breezy and punchy. Only a
duet with Peter Case sounds as if it were a traditional folk song
with acoustic guitars.
   ``I don't want to make folk music,'' Harding said. ``All my
favorite songwriters do folk music, but they're all dead or dirt
poor. Phil Spector is my hero. I like Phil Spector. I like ABBA. I
actually liked the Carpenters. They were great songs.''
   Harding's now doing the dirty work of slowly trying to build an
audience in the United States, touring as an opening act for
artists such as Michelle Shocked and the Mighty Lemon Drops. He's
not working with a band now, but promises a band tour this fall.
   ``It's not the divine right of a support act to have everyone
like them,'' he said. ``If they find the idea of one man playing an
acoustic guitar horrible, then I let them get into the humor of
some things. I want to give them a chance to get into me.''

   They were an unlikely duo: 71-year-old Wesley
Wilson, a bearded former landscaper, and his assistant, a lanky
14-year-old named Fred Barney.
   They stood before a dozen or so sixth-graders on a recent sunny
afternoon behind Westview Elementary School to teach tropical
horticulture.
   But there was a lot more to the lesson than growing orchids,
pineapple plants and aloe.
   ``The care you give a plant is what you get out of it,'' Wilson
tells the small group. ``It's like life.''
   And a lot like the relationship Wilson and his assistant have _
that of mentor and protege.
   The two came together through a school program that focuses on
nurturing and inspiring young people by matching them with talented
older volunteers.
   ``You look forward to every week you come,'' said Wilson during
a recent horticulture class at Westview in northwestern Dade
County, where he has met with students the past three years and
formed a gardening club.
   ``Sure it's work, but you don't spend time grumbling about
what's wrong with the world or your illnesses. You're interested
more about life in general,'' said Wilson, who founded several
plant organizations, including the International Palm Society and
the Rare Fruit Council.
   Fred doesn't hesitate to attribute the improvement in his grades
_ and outlook _ to Wilson's influence.
   ``When I first saw him (Wilson), something clicked inside me,''
said Fred.
   The teen-ager now attends the middle school next door, getting
mostly Bs, and joins Wilson for his weekly class.
   Florida's Senior Mentor Program has put the state, home to a
large population of retirees, in the forefront of a growing trend
nationwide to involve more older people in education.
   ``The fastest growing segment of the population is 60-plus,''
said Bentley Lipscomb, deputy director of the Washington-based
National Association of Partners in Education. ``This is going to
be a tremendous resource to our educational system in this
country.''
   Launched statewide in 1983, the mentor program has been
established in about one-third of Florida's school districts and is
one of a number of inter-generational programs that last year had
more than 15,000 senior volunteers helping about half as many young
people.
   The program is geared for creative students who may not qualify
for gifted or other school programs as well as at-risk students.
   Volunteers, who must be at least 50 _ currently the oldest is 88
_ are screened and must provide references. They are required to
spend at least 10 hours with a student, and projects can last six
to 12 weeks, or more.
   Funding comes from the state Department of Education and a
$50,000 annual grant from Chevron Corp. that will end next year.
   Dade County Schools hired two retired school teachers and a
retired administrator to recruit mentors, who now number nearly 100
retirees working with 220 children in grades two through 12, said
Ramona Frischman, coordinator of the schools' Department of
Community Participation.
   ``We don't just want highly professional retirees,'' Ms.
Frischman said. ``We also need and have a place for people who'll
work with arts and crafts, cooking, needlepoint, gardening and
those kinds of things.''
   Among the volunteers are retired lawyers, writers, artists and
one of the first five black policemen hired by the city of Miami in
1944.
   Ralph White, 73, who first patrolled Miami's black neighborhoods
on foot and spent 32 years on the force, meets weekly with three
at-risk students at Westview and small groups of students
interested in law enforcement.
   ``I figured I could be instrumental in trying to motivate kids
to stay in school and get a good education by telling them of my
experiences and the accomplishments of the department,'' said
White, who dropped out of school in junior high.
   ``He's a tremendous all-around role model,'' said Westview
Principal Richard Artmeier.
   In one project being watched nationwide, a dozen Dade students
were selected as aides to members of the Silver-Haired Legislature
during a four-day session last October in Tallahassee. The students
researched issues, helped write resolutions and presented their
positions on the floor.
   Despite initial resistance from some senior elected officials
concerning the junior aides, that was all overcome by the close of
the session, said Maryon Freifelder, a senior advocate from Miami
Beach.
   ``Some felt the (students) had no business being there,'' she
recalled. ``At first they couldn't understand, they couldn't see
the connection. ... By the end of the session three (students) gave
a five-minute presentation and got a standing ovation.''
   School officials say the intergenerational experience is
mutually beneficial.
   ``What they're finding is they have so many things in common,''
Ms. Frischman said. ``They're finding they can make things happen
together.''
   ``Sometimes the most important learning is outside the classroom
walls,'' she added. ``These people are living history. What these
children are learning is they're survivors.''
   Part of the program's success can be measured in the improvement
in attendance and academic performance, said Ms. Frischman.
   But there's an added benefit.
   ``With an aging society, this younger generation will have to
deal with a much older population,'' Ms. Frischman said. ``By
sensitizing them at this age, it'll make the world a lot better for
all of us.''

<TEXT>
   At 81, Margot Gayle doesn't get around much
anymore. But she recently led a group of senior citizens on a tour
of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Gracie Mansion and eight other
Manhattan landmarks _ and nobody left home.
   The architectural expedition was done via telephone, with a
conference call linking the participants. It's part of a program
developed by a Manhattan agency that feeds and entertains elderly,
homebound people.
   There are twice-a-month bingo games, and monthly literary
discussions. A visit to Italy is coming up in June. Mixed in are
more serious topics, such as safety tips from a policeman and hints
on handling home attendants.
   ``We have a lot of frail people living in four-story walk-ups
and other situations where participating in person is very hard,''
says Mrs. Gayle, who picked up on the phone program after knee
replacement surgery sidelined her.
   Mrs. Gayle is unique among the 70 senior citizens participating
in the program: She is a listener as well as a speaker. She's one
of the seniors who regularly checks out the ``You and Your Home
Attendant'' program, as is Mary Hopkins.
   ``They all seem to have the same problems, all the girls,'' said
Mrs. Hopkins, a 69-year-old shut-in who joins the hook-up about
twice a week. ``I'm grateful to have somebody to talk with.''
   The program is available to a limited audience _ the 350
homebound elderly people served by the Meals on Wheels program
operating on the East Side of Manhattan. It began one year ago with
four women playing telephone bingo, said Susan Brown, director of
the program.
   ``It was a brainstorm. The technology was there, we looked at
the cost, and saw it was doable,'' she said. ``We started out with
bingo because it wasn't scary ... and they loved the idea.''
   How popular has bingo-by-phone become?
   ``The other day, a woman called me from her doctor's office. She
wanted to make sure the appointment wouldn't conflict with her
game,'' Brown said.
   The seniors pay nothing _ the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood
Center, which operates Meals on Wheels, pays $4.57 per person per
hour to link the lonely, Brown said.
   Prior to each call, the center sends participants background
materials. Mrs. Gayle's listeners received a packet of photographs
of the sights she described; members of the literary round table
receive copies of short stories that will be discussed.
   The teleconference begins after an operator calls each
participant and hooks them on a single line. Brown acts as the
moderator, and each senior introduces themselves before the speaker
begins.
   A recent call on police safety showed the participants to be
unfailingly upbeat and polite. About midway through his 35-minute
talk, police Officer Lou Uliano was interrupted by one woman.
   ``Is it possible for this to be put in print for us? It's a
little difficult to remember all this,'' she said.
   ``That's a very good idea. ... We'll send them up with your
meals,'' replies the officer, who promised to include his phone
number at the 19th Precinct if they have any additional questions.
   Brown said she hopes teleconferencing spreads to other
organizations, and the seniors agree.
   ``It's a great idea. Very original,'' said Mrs. Gayle. ``Isn't
that nice? Every now and then a new idea surfaces that really
works.''

   Choosing a nursing home may be a bit easier
with the new federal guide to nursing care quality, but officials
say there's still no substitute for a personal visalition
for Nursing Home Reform.
   Non-profit nursing homes in Michigan and Iowa had found
inaccuracies in the report, Parkin said. ``It's a matter of
reputation, and they are quite upset.''
   But Morford said last month's report is a big improvement over
the first one, and more changes are expected next year. The new
report includes more categories of care quality, includes
inspection reports for two years instead of one, and shows which
facilities have been penalized for failing to meet government
standards.
   The timing of inspections soon will be made more flexible so
homes can't predict them, Morford said.
   The reports will be used to monitor the effects of a major
change in nursing home regulation, enacted in 1987, which is
gradually being implemented by HCFA this year.
   The law allows new federal penalties to bring facilities into
line, imposes a training requirement for nurses' aides, and
requires screening for patients' mental health needs.

   In the University of Massachusetts gerontology
program, where most students are over 60, classes tend to be noisy,
even rowdy.
   ``There's often a lot of disagreement, a lot of interaction,''
said Scott Bass, director of the program.
   ``You can try to lecture, and talk about theories, but these
students have actually been a part of these things, and they have
something to say,'' said Bass, 40.
   Students say the two-semester program spares them struggling
with the endless fine tuning of golf or tennis or the boredom of
repeated visits to the beach. More important, they say, is that it
arms them with the knowledge to help society's vulnerable older
citizens.
   ``I never thought of retiring to Florida,'' said student Betty
Francis. ``I just want to keep busy. If I believe in something I
like to work with it, and I want to work with the elderly.''
   Bass said the 10-year-old program at the university's Boston
campus is specifically geared toward older students. It examines
the economic, social and political issues that affect older people.
   Graduates receive a certificate in gerontological studies. They
can continue school, work for human service agencies or elderly
advocacy groups or volunteer to help older people.
   The 45 graduates of the class of 1990 included retired social
workers, a nurse, a priest and business people. Graduates ranged in
age from 33 to 83, but most were over 64.
   ``Oh, I'm excited. I've enjoyed every minute of the program and
now I'm ready to graduate,'' said Mary Nowell, 70.
   A chance meeting with a frail elderly woman eight years ago
prompted Nowell to study the problems of the aging.
   Walking in the city's Dorchester section, she saw a woman in her
80s struggling to carry a sack of groceries. Nowell helped the
woman to her home, a squalid, tiny apartment. The woman had little
money, no family and was plagued by ill health.
   ``It was just like a hole in the wall, very bad conditions,''
Nowell recalled. ``I was shocked. She had nobody.''
   What shook Nowell most was that the woman, who since has died,
was intelligent and educated.
   ``She was a brilliant woman, I didn't know what had happened to
her,'' Nowell said. ``But it wasn't for me to know why or how. It
can happen to anyone. I just knew she needed help.''
   After she retired from her bookkeeping job last year, Nowell
enrolled at UMass. She hopes to eventually get her bachelor's
degree.
   In the fall term students examine the aging process from several
angles _ physical, emotional, economic and political _ and each
student spends time with an elderly invalid.
   In the spring, the class works together on a research project.
   The students, many who haven't been to school in nearly 50
years, are often shy and nervous in the fall.
   ``Little things college students take for granted, like filling
in computerized registration forms, can be intimidating for older
people,'' Bass said.
   But students quickly develop an animated rapport with teachers,
injecting theoretical discussions with generous doses of real life.
   ``When we talk about state and federal programs for the elderly,
many of our students were around when they were conceived, and they
have a lot to say,'' Bass said. ``Their input is very rewarding for
everyone.''

<HEAD>Book To Highlight Memories of Depression-era Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Depression-era farmers are the last links
with the sweat and joy of life on a small, diverse family farm,
according to two people who plan to preserve those memories in a
book called ``Salt of the Earth.''
   ``We wanted to go out _ indeed, we felt compelled to go out _
and talk to these old guys,'' said one of the authors, Teresa
Norris-Phillips, a freelance copywriter.
   She and Candis Kelly, a graphic designer, have collected stories
and photographs of nine Illinois farmers ages 79 to 94.
   Among them is Eli Meiss, who remembers a generation of farmers
who ate the fruit and vegetables they grew, churned butter from the
cows they milked and carved hams from the pigs they raised.
   ``We were self-sufficient,'' Meiss said. ``Today, a farmer's
just like a poor city boy.''
   Peter Ropp recalls kerosene lamps for light, horses for
transportation and stoves for heat.
   ``When returning from town on a cold night in a horse-drawn
vehicle,'' Ropp said, ``it was heartening to see the glow of the
stove from the hill a half-mile south of home ... a real joy on a
winter night to watch the yellow and blue flames play after the
coal was added.''
   Norris-Phillips and Kelly set out in January 1989 with tape
recorder and camera, uncertain of how two city women would be
greeted.
   ``We arrived at the door thinking, `Why would they want to tell
us their life stories?''' Kelly recalled. ``We'd walk out backward
three hours later saying, `We really gotta' go now.'''
   The women listened and looked.
   They stood atop James Yontz's tall grain bins at San Jose; they
looked at the faint traces of stagecoach tracks at Dill Seymour's
home near Seymour.
   Rather than using set questions, Norris-Phillips let the farmers
reminisce and focus what mattered most to them.
   Meiss, born in 1905 at Fairbury, began farming at the height of
the Depression _ in a year when drought and chinch bugs devastated
his oats.
   ``Maybe starting in the '30s was good for us,'' he said. ``I
can't say I've ever lost any sleep if I had a short crop, but I'm
always glad if I get more.''
   During interviews for the book, Kelly watched the farmers
carefully ``to learn who they are visually,'' and always included
their hands in her black-and-white portraits.
   Farmers who met with the women said they think their stories
will be interesting, perhaps even educational.
   ``We lived in a different age,'' said Ropp, 84, of Normal. ``It
always helps to learn of the trials and tribulations of your
ancestors _ helps people to deal with present-day problems.''

<HEAD>Get a Good Night's Sleep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. T. Franklin Williams</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although sleep patterns may change over the
years, scientists know that restless sleep is not an inevitable
part of aging.
   In fact, troubled sleep may be a sign of emotional or physical
disorders and should be evaluated by a doctor or sleep specialist.
   At any age there are some common sleep disorders. Tossing and
turning all night is one example of isomnia, but there are others.
Taking more than 30 to 45 minutes to fall asleep, waking up many
times each night, or waking up early and being unable to get back
to sleep can mean you have insomnia.
   With rare exceptions, insomnia is a symptom of a problem, not
the problem itself.
   Snoring may be the sign of another sleep disorder _ sleep apnea.
In this situation, the individual stops breathing for brief periods
each night. Loud snoring coupled with daytime sleepiness may be
symptoms of sleep apnea. A doctor specializing in sleep disorders
can make a definite diagnosis and recommend treatment.
   Unusual leg movements, called nocturnal myoclonus or periodic
movements of sleep, also are common. Although scientists don't know
what causes these leg movements, sometimes medication can bring
relief. Mild cases may be helped by leg exercises.
   Scientists researching sleep disorders have made some
interesting discoveries. For example, Dr. Charles Czeisler and
colleagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard
University, in a project funded by the National Institute on Aging,
report that the body's internal biological clock is far more
sensitive to light than previously thought.
   In fact, Czeisler found that light may be the single most
important factor in resetting this clock. Using this information,
Czeisler and his colleagues have begun to treat some of the common
sleep-related complaints of their older patients.
   Other scientists are investigating the changes occurring in
sleep and wakefulness as people age. Research also is exploring
various treatments for sleep disorders and examining what the
medical profession and the public need to know about good sleep
practices.
   However, there are some things we already know:
   _ Follow a regular schedule. Go to sleep and get up at the same
time each day.
   _ Try to exercise at regular times each day. Moderate physical
activity two to four hours before bedtime may improve sleep. Check
with your doctor before beginning any exercise program.
   _ To adjust your internal sleep clock, try to get some exposure
to the natural light in the afternoon each day.
   _ Develop a bedtime routine. Do the same things each night to
tell your body it's time to wind down. Some people watch the
evening news, read a book, or soak in a warm bath.
   _ Don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes to help you sleep.
Drinking even small amounts of alcohol can make it harder to stay
asleep. Smoking is not only dangerous (the hazards of falling
asleep with a lit cigarette), but nicotine is a stimulant.
   _ Be aware of what you eat. Avoid caffeinated beverages late in
the day. Caffeine is a stimulant. If you like a snack before bed, a
glass of warm milk may help you relax.
   _ After turning off the light, give yourself about 15 minutes to
fall asleep. If you still are awake, or lose your drowsiness, get
up and go into another room until you feel sleepy again.
   _ Try not to worry about sleep. Playing some mental games may
help. For example, think black _ a black cat on a black pillow on a
black sofa, etc.
   If you are so tired during the day that you cannot function, and
this fatigue lasts more than two to three weeks, see a doctor. For
help locating a sleep specialist, contact the Association of
Professional Sleep Societies, 604 Second St., SW, Rochester, Minn.

<HEAD>Sweet Corn Sometimes Can Be Too Sweet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candy on the cob. That's the trend
nowadays in garden corn. But not everybody thrills to super-sweet,
some preferring the oldtime flavor.
   The raccoon isn't fussy. Unless you put up foolproof defenses,
he'll get your best ears, whether standard varieties like ``Silver
Queen,'' or the new, saccharine entries with names like ``Kandy
Korn,'' ``How Sweet It Is,'' ``Xtra Sweet,'' and ``Florida
Staysweet.''
   In this sugary scene, breeders aimed at developing types of corn
that stay sweet after picking.
   As everyone knows, standard corn turns to starch quickly, hence
the ritual of rushing fresh-picked ears to the already-boiling pot
before the sweetness fades. The new varieties, however, can lie
around as long as two weeks after harvesting and remain sweet, a
boon to agribusiness, the supermarket, road stands and perhaps, the
dentist's office.
   Liking to try new things, I've grown the ultra-sweety, but
missed what my palate remebered as true corn flavor. The ears
tasted more like dessert than a vegetable course. Numerous such
reactions from home gardeners have prompted the National Gardening
Association to recommend that you try a few for taste before
discarding old favorites.
   Fortunately, most seed houses still carry ``Silver Queen,'' a
late-maturing white variety that many of us regard as the best of
the kind that you rush to the pot.
   Another old-time star, ``Golden Cross Bantam,'' is not so easy
to find, however. I've spotted it in Burpee's catalog this year,
but the cover, in line with the trend, features a gorgeous color
photo of two ears of a ``sugar-extender'' called ``Breeder's
Choice,'' said to ``stay sweet and tender on the stalk for at least
10 days.''
   You've got to look sharply when ordering from a catalog for
warnings that some super-sweets need isolation from your standard
corn. Otherwise, cross-pollination will produce tough, starchy
kernels of both types. On the plus side, some of the new ones are
smaller, no taller than 4 or 5 feet, a welcome development for
gardeners with limited space.
   Whether we opt now for extra-sweet or standard, corn takes a
gardener centuries back to America's Indian origins. We celebrate
the legacy with succotash, the hearty corn and beans dish created
long before nutritionists talked of balancing carbohydrates and
proteins.
   You plant corn in springtime when, as they say, young oak leaves
are about as large as a mouse's ears, and start harvetsing in the
full heat of the summer. If you're a beginner, be sure to plant at
least two rows, but preferably a block of four, to insure good
pollination. Without it, the ears will turn out woefully short of
kernels.
   The old saying that you should grow enough corn for both you and
the raccoon may be all right if you plant an acre. But a gardener
hoping for maybe 50 ears in a season may find his whole crop
devoured by night-striking masked bandits. Many gardeners,
unwilling to undertake the work and expense of securing the crop,
just give up on corn after such tragedies.
   But I've fought back and can say, with fingers crossed, that
I've frustrated the raccoon for several years now. I credit mainly
a battery-operated ``hot'' wire that I strung atop my pre-existing
chicken wire fence.
   The wire, long used in livestock control, delivers a harmless
but memorable shock on contact and the raccoon thinks it over
before trying again.
   Such ``fencers,'' as they are called, are available from garden
supply companies, hardware stores or horse equipment places. I got
mine from Sears and did the job for a total of about $100.
   Living in the country at a distance from neighbors, I've also
installed in the garden a blinking light and a radio tuned to an
all-night news station. These are aimed at frightening deer as well
as raccoons.
   Baiting the ``hot'' wire with strips of aluminum coated with
peanut butter gives an inquisitive deer a jolt on the snout and it
will stay away after that.
   That's the theory, anyhow, and for me it beats going to
barbershops for scraps of human hair, another supposed deer
deterrent. I also have an enthusiastic helper, a young shelty named
Lucy with fast feet and a sharp bark.

   Peg O'Brien usually held her tongue when
older women called the legal aid office for advice and then
lamented that a ``young thing'' couldn't understand the woes of a
60-year-old widow.
   ``But once in a while, I'd say `I do know,''' said Mrs. O'Brien,
who was graduated in May from Boston College Law School. ``I'm
older than you are _ and I'm a widow.''
   Mrs. O'Brien turns 65 in August. Just how many people in her age
group are taking up law studies is not known. But the Law School
Admissions Services in Newtown, Pa., reported that the numbers of
test applicants ages 40 to 49 nearly doubled from 1984-85 to 4,160
in 1888-89.
   ``There are lot of second-career people, but this woman is
highly unusual,'' Kathy Grove, an attorney who is a consultant on
legal education to the American Bar Association.
   Mrs. O'Brien has been clearing paths most of her life. She was
among seven of about 70 girls in her high school class preparing
for college.
   After graduating from Emmanuel College with a math degree, she
was hired by an insurance company and was told she was its first
employee from a Catholic women's college.
   In 1980, Mrs. O'Brien became the first woman elected to the
Norwell Board of Selectmen.
   After her husband's death in 1983, she took a paralegal course
and went to work for an agency that provided guardian services for
the elderly. Soon Mrs. O'Brien was thinking she could be a better
advocate if she was a lawyer herself.
   She took the law school admissions test on a lark, telling no
one. The results were good. So, on another lark she applied to
three Boston law schools. All three accepted her.
   In the past few years, Boston College Law School graduated two
men in their 60s. About 10 years ago a lawyer's widow of similar
age earned a law degree to take over his practice.

<HEAD>Study Says Effects of Obesity on Elderly Overrated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should worry more about older people
who are underweight than those who are overweight, according to a
study.
   The research by the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public
Health runs counter to many popular beliefs about weight gain. The
study of 4,710 people found that overweight white women died at the
same rate as those of normal weight. Death rates for overweight men
were only slightly higher than they were among men in the normal
weight range.
   ``Weight in and of itself is a relatively minor risk factor,''
said Dr. Matthew Tayback, coordinator of the Johns Hopkins Center
on Aging.
   ``If there's something to pursue as an unrecognized risk factor
in the elderly, we think it's more important to look at low
weight,'' said Dr. Shiriki Kumanyika, a former Hopkins
epidemiologist now at Pennsylvania State University.
   The results of the study appeared recently in the Archives of
Internal Medicine, a publication of the American Medical
Association.
   Dr. Richard Sprott of the National Institute on Aging said he
had not read the study, but cautioned that it looked only at
mortality and not quality of life.
   ``Being obese may not kill you, but it sure makes it hard to
play tennis,'' he said.
   The researchers found that death rates of overweight and
optimum-weight women studied were identical. Overweight men ages 65
to 74 ran a 10 percent greater chance of dying.
   In contrast, underweight men and women in the same age group ran
a 30 percent greater chance of dying.
   Obesity, however, should not be ruled out as a risk factor for
younger Americans, said Tayback, who suggested that the overweight
elderly may fare well statistically because people whose obesity
contributes to fatal heart attacks die before they get old.

<HEAD>Bidwell Leaving Chrysler, Shrinking Executive Ranks More</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bennett Bidwell, the sometimes-acerbic Chrysler
Corp. executive, said today he plans to retire at the end of the
year, becoming the automaker's fourth high-ranking official to
announce his departure recently.
   Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler Motors, the company's car- and
truck-making operation, said he will step down Jan. 1 at age 63.
Speculation about Bidwell's retirement has been circulating for
months.
   ``It's time to put all this speculation to rest,'' Bidwell said
in a statement released this morning, ``and let the media go back
to covering some of the other important stories of our day such as
perestroika, democracy in Eastern Europe and the search for a cure
to AIDS.''
   Bidwell, known for his frank, sometimes combative speeches,
joined Chrysler in 1983 after serving two years as president of The
Hertz Corp. He worked for Ford Motor Co. for 27 years before that.
   Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald and Vice President for
International Operations Michael Hammes have quit this year. Vice
President and Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman has said he will leave
this summer.
   There have been reports that Bidwell wanted to reduce his
workload to improve his health, but demands at the company
prevented that.
   ``I'm in reasonably good health, but it's time to decelerate a
little,'' Bidwell said. ``Chrysler has a solid plan to be a major
competitor into the '90s and beyond, and it has the best management
team in the industry to accomplish the plan.
   ``If the environment were to change significantly, and I were
really needed, I'm prepared to alter my plans.''
   Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker behind General Motors
Corp. and Ford, has watched its profits and market share decline
during the past year. Questions about a takeover or a substantial
investment from another company have been circulating.
   Chrysler reported an 80 percent decline in its first-quarter
earnings this year compared with last year. Analysts don't expect
any significant improvement in the company's earnings until the
fourth quarter of this year.
   At the end of last month, Chrysler's share of the U.S. car
market stood at 8.3 percent, down from 9.6 percent a year earlier.
Its share of the light truck market slipped to 20.4 percent from

   Last week, a week after Greenwald quit to head an employee
effort to buy United Airlines for $4.54 billion, Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca said he would continue running the corporation past the
Dec. 8, 1991, expiration date on his four-year contract. It isn't
known how long Iacocca will stay beyond then.

<HEAD>Report Says Trump, Banks Reach Tentative Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump has reached a tentative debt
restructuring agreement with his bank creditors that would provide
him with both money and time to mend his troubled empire, a source
familiar with the deal confirmed today.
   The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said the banks agreed
over the weekend to lend Trump an additional $60 million and to
suspend interest payments on $2 billion in debt.
   In exchange, Trump would pledge some of the remaining real
estate or casino assets that aren't completely collateralized,
including the Trump Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., and the
Trump Tower building in Manhattan, the source said.
   Norma Foerderer, an executive assistant for Trump, said the
Trump Organization would have no comment on the report of an
agreemnt, which first appeared in today's Wall Street Journal. ``We
have nothing to say about it,'' she said.
   Trump confirmed last week that he was negotiating with major
banks to restructure his debt. The banks reportedly have become
concerned that Trump may not be able to handle the billion-dollar
debt he ran up buying big real estate and casino properties given
the current slowdowns in both industries.
   Recent purchases, such as the Plaza Hotel and Trump Shuttle
airline, have added to Trump's financial woes because neither is
reported to be making money.
   Trump's biggest bank creditors _ including Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Manufacturers
Hanvover Corp. _ planned to discuss the weekend debt restructuring
deal today with about 10 smaller creditors, according to the source.
   ``If any one of the other banks do not go along, then the deal
does not work,'' the Journal quoted on unidentified banker as
saying.
   Bankers Trust spokesman Thomas Parisi said he couldn't comment
on the reported deal, adding, ``When an agreement is reached we'll
probably release a statement.''
   Other banks contacted had no immediate comment.
   The source familiar with the negotiations said the major banks'
contributions toward the $60 million will be porportionate to the
amount they previously lent, with Citicorp and Bankers Trust making
up around two-thirds of the new loan.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as
traders sold contracts in reaction to dry weather in the Midwest
over the weekend.
   The weather allowed soybean planting to advance and provided
better growing conditions for the corn crop after rain last month
delayed some corn planting.
   Selling interest in the futures markets was tempered, though, by
forecasts for rain in the region this week.
   ``Overall, the market does seem to be finding some support here
and trying to firm up,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The Agriculture Department will report this afternoon on
planting progress.
   In early trading, wheat futures were were 1\ cents to 1} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in July at $3.29{ a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 3} cents lower with July at $2.82{ a bushel;
oats were 3 cents to 4} cents lower with July at $1.43{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3\ cents to 4 cents lower with July at $5.96{ a

   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
June at 75.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with August at 85.42 cents a pound; live hogs were
.15 cent lower to .65 cent higher with June at 64 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .80 cent higher with

   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

   Share prices closed lower Monday on London's Stock
Exchange, despite a surge on Wall Street.
   Traders said the London market opened weaker and continued to
fall on disappointing British retail sales figures.
   A report showed that retail sales rose by 1.2 percent in May,
well above market expectations of a 0.4 percent rise. The data
suggested that current high interest rates aren't having the
desired dampening effect on consumer demand.
   A lack of buying interest in quiet afternoon trading further
depressed the market, which ignored Wall Street's climb, dealers
said.

   Korean Air today ordered 23 Boeing 747-400s for
$4.8 billion, the third-largest order ever received by the Seattle
airplane manufacturer.
   The order was announced at a news conference in Washington,
D.C., by Boeing Co. Chairman Frank Shrontz and C.H. Cho, a Korean
Air senior executive vice president.
   The order is the third multibillion-dollar purchase of Boeing
aircraft in as many weeks. The others also were from Asian air
carriers: a $2 billion order from the Chinese government and a $3.1
billion order from Japan Air Lines.
   Boeing has received single orders for more planes, but only two
exceed the Korean Air order in dollar value: an April 1989 order by
Irish aircraft leasing company GPA Ltd. worth $9.4 billion for 182
planes, and a $7.11 billion deal for 180 planes placed a week later
by United Airlines.
   The 747-400, the world's largest passenger jet, can carry 412
passengers more than 8,000 miles nonstop. The planes normally sell
for $116 million to $136 million each, but officials said the
Korean Air price reflects the estimated value of the dollar at the
time of delivery, later this decade. The price also includes spare
parts and training.
   Boeing has now received 307 orders for the 747-400, which
entered service in early 1989. So far, 71 have been delivered.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Mexico embarked today on
a major effort to expand bilateral trade and investment, agreeing
to open talks on reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement.
   President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
who met at the White House Sunday night, believe that a
``comprehensive free trade agreement is the best vehicle'' for
forging a more ``vigorous partnership,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   The two presidents directed their trade advisers to open
preliminary discussions with an eye toward concluding them before
the next Bush-Salinas meeting in Monterrey in December.
   They agreed that the ``greatest possible mutual benefit'' would
derive from an agreement that entails the gradual and comprehensive
elimination of trade barriers and the fullest possible reduction of
non-tariff trade barriers.
   Bush and Salinas see free trade as a ``powerful engine for
economic development,'' Fitzwater said.
   Salinas met today with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
members of Congress and planned to make a strong pitch for
increased foreign investment tonight when he speaks to a gathering
of top U.S. business executives.
   Salinas initially was cool to the idea of a free trade agreement
with the United States but now he says an economic takeoff in
Mexico will not be possible without it.
   His change of heart apparently occurred after his efforts to
seek foreign investment from Europe fell far short of expectations.
   ``Mexico will not be left out of the new world configuration,''
Salinas said last month. ``The speed of the changes requires
decisive answers on all fronts, in all markets.''
   Two-way trade with Mexico is about $52 billion a year but
experts say there is potential for a substantial increase, given
the barriers to trade in both countries, particularly Mexico.
   The agreement also could lead to substantially increased
investment opportunities for U.S. businesses in Mexico.
   If successful, the trade negotiations could bring all of North
America _ 335 million people _ into a single market free of tariffs
and other barriers to trade. The United States and Canada entered a
free trade agreement two years ago.
   The pact with Canada took four years to work out, but Salinas,
who was given a mandate by the Mexican Senate last month to
negotiate a pact, has said he hopes one can be concluded quickly.
   The two leaders are hopeful that after preliminary discussions,
formal negotiations can begin by the time of the next Bush-Salinas
meeting in December in Monterrey, Mexico.
   In both the United States and Mexico, organized labor has been
worried that free trade could mean a loss of jobs, but a recent
report by the conservative Heritage Foundation said there would be
no losers.
   ``History shows that each economy would be helped by freer
access to the other,'' the report said.
   The 42-year-old Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, is
visiting here at time of unusual harmony in U.S.-Mexican relations.
The lone setback recently was a U.S.-orchestrated kidnaping in
April of a Mexican doctor accused of complicity in the killing of a
Drug Enforcement Administration agent in 1985.
   During the 1980s, U.S.-Mexican relations were marked by deep
mutual suspicion because of differences over Central America.
   These days, the cross-border mood is altogether different. U.S.
officials have repeatedly praised Salinas for his willingness to
crack down on drug smugglers and for his efforts to modernize the
Mexican economy.
   Among other measures, he has liberalized foreign investment
regulations and begun selling resource-draining state enterprises
to private interests.

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices gained Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by technically inspired buying
after selling interest dried up early in the session.
   Wheat futures also advanced while oats finished lower.
   Analysts said many of the large speculators who sold corn and
soybean contracts heavily last week returned Monday as buyers,
which helped to lift prices to their highest levels in about two
weeks.
   Buying enthusiasm was limited by perceptions that dry weather in
the Midwest will allow planting to advance, although showers were
expected to return to the region later this week.
   William Biedermann, director of research for the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc., said the corn market also was supported
by expectations that an Agriculture Department report due out
Tuesday will confirm ideas that corn supplies are extremely tight.
   In its weekly export inspections report released after the
close, the USDA indicated an amount of soybeans inspected for
shipment last week that was greater than the trade had expected.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 1\ cents to 4{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.32{ a bushel;
corn futures were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with July at $2.89} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $1.47\ a

   Nestle Holdings Inc. on Monday announced a
reorganization of several of its businesses in the United States,
including its coffee and ice cream operations.
   The coffee units of Nestle Foods Co. will be joined with
Nestle-owned Hills Bros. Coffee Co. to form Nestle-Hills Coffee Co.
The new company will be based in San Francisco and will include the
brands Nescafe, Hills Bros., Tasters Choice, MJB, Chase and
Sanborn, and Sarks and Zoegas.
   The ice cream and dairy businesses of Nestle and the Carnation
Co. will be folded together to form Nestle Ice Cream Co., which
will market all brands currently handled by the two separate units.
Major manufacturing plants for the ice cream unit will be managed
from Los Angeles.
   In a third change, the Stouffer Restaurant Co. will be merged
with the Stouffer Hotel Co. to form the Stouffer Hospitality Group.
The headquarters of the combined companies will continue to be in
Cleveland.
   Further steps to consolidate businesses operated by the U.S.
subsidiary of the big Swiss foods company are under study.
Specifically, reorganization in the management of food services
sales and product distribution is being studied, the company said
in a news release.
   James M. Biggar, chairman of Nestle Holdings, said the changes
are aimed at eliminating overlap and taking advantage of operating
efficiencies.
   ``Nestle in the United States has been organized primarily along
the lines of how it was acquired,'' he said. ``Now, it will seek to
maximize efficiencies resulting from its marketing power and
distribution strength to achieve greater focus.''

<HEAD>Australian Government to Block Maxwell Deal, Treasurer Says
^Eds: SUBS 6th graf with two grafs adding comment from Maxwell;

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said Monday that
his government would object to British publisher Robert Maxwell's
plans to take a 49 percent stake in the West Australian Newspaper.
   Maxwell plans to buy the holding from troubled Australian
financier Alan Bond's Bell Group Ltd. for the equivalent of about
$192.5 million.
   It amounts to a controlling interest which would run counter to
the country's laws on foreign press ownership, Keating said at a
London news conference.
   Keating said the Australian government has ``always taken a very
strict view of newspaper ownership'' and would not agree to the
sale as it now stands.
   Keating defined as ``controlling'' anything above a 25 percent
interest. He declined to comment further.
   ``I am puzzled by Mr. Keating's alleged remarks at the press
conference in London today, stating that Australian law prohibits
foreign ownership of newspapers with an excess of 25 percent,''
Maxwell said Monday night. ``To my knowledge no such legislation
exists in Australia.''
   Maxwell added that it was ``injudicious'' of Keating to comment
before receiving Mirror Group Newspapers' application.
   Two years ago, the Australian government rejected a Maxwell bid
for the Melbourne Age.
   Under the deal announced earlier Monday, Maxwell was planning to
take a 49 percent stake in the West Australian through his Mirror
Group PLC.
   Bell, which also holds 49 percent of the Perth Daily News and
several suburban newspapers, was to retain a 50 percent share,
while an identified ``distinguished Australian citizen'' was to
hold the remaining 1 percent.
   Maxwell already holds a 14.9 percent interest in Bell, though
the completion of the purchase is still pending a legal challenge
by Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission.

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 4
cents to settle at $16.82 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract gained
11 cents Friday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery lost 0.71 cent to
close at 55.88 cents a gallon, after falling 1.02 cents Friday.
   The July contract for wholesale home heating oil, which rose
0.31 cent Friday, settled at 46.72 cents a gallon, off 0.49 cent.
   In natural gas trading, prices ended mixed. The July contract
closed marginally lower at $1.572 per 1,000 cubic feet compared
with $1.575 Friday. Later contracts settled slightly lower to
slightly higher.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lack of fresh economic news led to a slow day
for currency traders Monday as the dollar was lower against most
major currencies except the Japanese yen. Gold prices were mixed.
   ``It's been very quiet today, all day long,'' said Lorenzo
Troni, vice president for foreign exchange at PaineWebber
International Ltd. in New York. ``I think everyone is waiting for
some economic data.''
   Later this week, the government is to release reports on retail
sales, producer prices and consumer prices. The market apparently
is anticipating lower inflation and lower retail sales that could
prompt the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates, leading to
a weaker dollar, Troni said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.45 yen to a closing 154.10 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 154.45 yen. In New York, it
climbed to 154.77 yen from 153.49 late Friday.
   One trader, Linda McLaughlin of Chemical Bank, attributed the
dollar's strength against the yen to money from individual
investors in Japan who have just received semi-annual bonuses. The
workers are apparently looking to invest in U.S. markets, she said.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6858, stronger
than $1.6843 late Friday. The pound traded at $1.6860 late Monday
in New York, more expensive than $1.6840 late Friday.
   Other New York rates late Monday, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.6927 West German marks, down from 1.6975; 1.4430
Swiss francs, down from 1.4495; 5.6965 French francs, down from
5.7145; 1.1710 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1743; and 1,243.25
Italian lire, down from 1,248.00.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday's levels
included: 1.4400 Swiss francs, down from 1.4480; 5.6900 French
francs, down from 5.7155; 1.9040 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9088;
1,242.75 Italian lire, down from 1,248.50; 1.6910 West German
marks, down from 1.6973 marks; and 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1743.
   Gold bullion for current delivery rose 70 cents to $356.40 a
troy ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange. Republic National
Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $355.10 a troy ounce, up 10
cents from late Friday.
   Gold was quoted at a bid of $354.45 per troy ounce in London
late Monday, down from $354.50 a troy ounce late Friday. In Zurich,
the bid price was $355, up from $354 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.28 to close at a bid of
$355.75 an ounce.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.01 a troy ounce, down
from Friday's $5.02. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver
for current delivery rose 0.5 cent to close at $5.012 a troy ounce.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese businessman and his bond
trader-wife settled federal allegations Monday that they traded in
the stock of John O. Butler Co. using illegal insider information
about a pending buyout.
   Jiro Yamazaki and his wife, Ikuko Sekiguchi-Yamazaki, agreed to
pay $99,703 in fines, restitution and interest without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced.
   The couple's attorney was not in his office when called for
comment Monday afternoon.
   The couple, both Japanese nationals who live in the New York
City suburb of Scarsdale, were accused of making $45,000 in illegal
trading profits. They allegedly traded using confidential corporate
information that Butler, a Chicago-based oral hygiene products
maker, was going to be acquired by Sunstar Corporation, a Japanese
health and beauty aids maker.
   They were accused of buying Butler Co. stock for between $13.25
and $13.75 a share before a $25 per share tender offer was made
public in March 1988.
   According to the SEC, Yamazaki was assistant treasurer in the
New York office of a major international bank that was part of a
consortium financing Sunstar's tender offer for Butler.
   Ms. Sekiguchi-Yamazaki, who allegedly purchased the stock with
information supplied by her husband, was identified as a bond
salesperson for a securities firm in New York.
   The SEC declined to identify the employer of either Yamazaki or
his wife.

<HEAD>Amid Takeover Rumors, Foxboro Exploring Possible `Alliance'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foxboro Co., a leading maker of systems that
control manufacturing processes, said Monday it is exploring what
it called an ``alliance'' with other firms that could involve the
sale of the company.
   The announcement came amid speculation that began last week
about a possible takeover of the company. The talk drove up the
price of Foxboro stock, which closed Monsday at $30 a share, up
$1.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
   A week ago the stock sold for $24 a share. Last year it traded
as low as $18.62{, said Albert Turner, a securities analyst at Duff
&amp; Phelps in Chicago.
   Foxboro systems are used to record and control processes in
manufacturing such as temperature, pressure, humidity and liquid
levels. Its customers are largely in the chemical and petroleum
industries and include such familiar names as Exxon Corp. and Dow
Chemical Co.
   The international company, based in the suburb of Foxboro,
employs 7,000 people. The company reported a net loss for 1989 of
$4.6 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $598 million.
   In a carefully worded announcement, the company said it was
``exploring alternatives with respect to a possible strategic
alliance with a limited number of firms.''
   Such an alliance, it said, ``could add complementary strengths
to the company's existing strong process control capability.''
   The deal it is exploring, the company added, ``could involve an
equity investment in all or a substantial portion of its stock.''
   It also said, however, that no decision had been made on whether
such a deal might even transpire.
   Telephone calls to John C. Fuller, a member of the Foxboro board
and a vice president for investor relations, were not returned.
   Foxboro would be an attractive buy, Turner said. Among its
attributes are an old and loyal customer base and a new product
line first offered two years ago that enables Foxboro systems to be
integrated with those of other companies.
   But the new system has had costly bugs in it, Turner said.
   ``It's not clear that all of the problems have been completely
worked out in this new system, and this company has had to borrow
money to finance its operations in the last four years,'' Turner
said. ``They could use a little financial backing.''
   Robert Sullivan, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
said Foxboro is coming out of a restructuring period.
   ``The company's record in the last few years has been quite
erratic, which has led to some dissatisfaction on the part of some
stockholders,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It's a big and growing market and as (manufacturing) companies
are forced by law to reduce pollution, one of the things they will
be forced to spend money on is equipment to reduce pollution,''
Sullivan said.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty years after it introduced Orlon to
the world of sweaters, socks and knit outerwear, Du Pont Co.
announced Monday it will stop production of the acrylic fiber as
soon as possible.
   The fiber has been overproduced worldwide and consumers now
prefer cotton and polyester fabrics, said Paul G. Gillease,
director of Du Pont's textile division.
   ``As a result, the business has not been sufficiently profitable
in recent years,'' Gillease said.
   Byron J. McCutchen, the company's Orlon business manager, said
that for the past several years, Orlon sales have been about $200
million annually.
   Du Pont plans to focus production on its Lycra spandex fiber,
used in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards; nylon; and
its Dacron polyester.
   Gillease said those fibers ``present significant growth
opportunities (and) will be more beneficial to the long-term
interests of Du Pont and its customers and will strengthen our
position in the U.S. apparel market.''
   Orlon is produced at Du Pont plants in Camden, S.C., and
Waynesboro, Va. There are about 725 employees divided between the
two plants.
   J.J. Pryor, a company spokeswoman, said Du Pont will try to
absorb the workers into other operations.
   She said about 50 Orlon marketing and business employees are
spread among company headquarters in Wilmington, New York and
Charlotte, N.C.
   McCutchen said the phase-out will not affect the Beaumont,
Texas, plant where acrylonitrile is produced. Acrylonitrile is the
raw material used to make Orlon. McCutchen said the raw material
will be sold to other companies.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Markets Rebound From Early Stumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures posted strong gains Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after a lower opening. Analysts attributed
the rebound largely to technically inspired buying.
   Wheat futures also advanced while oats finished lower.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures were mixed; pork
bellies surged, leading livestock and meat futures higher; cocoa
futures plummeted; and precious metals rose.
   Corn futures settled 3 cents to 5\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $2.89} a bushel; soybeans were 6
cents to 10{ cents higher with July at $6.08\ a bushel; wheat
futures settled 1\ cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $3.32} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent lower across the board with July at $1.47\
a bushel.
   Analysts said many of the large speculators who sold soybean
contracts Friday returned Monday as buyers, helping to lift soybean
prices to their highest levels in two weeks.
   The corn market extended a strong upward trend supported by last
month's rain, which delayed planting, and by perceptions that corn
supplies are unusually tight.
   An Agriculture Department report due out Tuesday probably will
confirm private expectations for ``one of the tightest
relationships between corn ending stocks and demand in history,''
said William Biedermann, director of research for the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Buying enthusiasm was limited by ideas that dry weather in the
Midwest will allow planting of corn and soybeans to advance,
although showers are expected to return to the region later this
week.
   In its weekly export inspections report released after the
close, the USDA indicated an amount of soybeans inspected for
shipment last week that was greater than the trade had expected.
   Energy futures prices ended mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with crude oil posting modest gains and unleaded gasoline
and heating oil declining.
   Traders described activity as lackluster in the absence of any
new market-moving news. They said the market virtually ignored the
continued burning of a supertanker in the Gulf Coast _ the biggest
oil news of the day _ since shipping into Southern ports isn't
expected to be affected.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents lower to 4
cents higher with July at $16.82 a barrel; heating oil was .62 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with July at 46.72 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .89 cent lower with July at 55.88
cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork bellies for July and August delivery rose the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting higher prices in the fresh-belly market and
bullish chart signals.
   The strength in the belly market carried over to the livestock
pits, helping cattle and hog futures to close higher.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .52 cent higher with June at
76.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent higher
with August at 85.45 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to 1.08
cents higher with June at 64.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .08 cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at 69.75 cents a
pound.
   Cocoa futures plunged in a technically inspired sell-off on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange. The market has become
vulnerable to a sharp decline since fears of supply disruptions
from the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, have
faded.
   Cocoa settled $45 to $61 lower with July at $1,181 per ton.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures finished 50 cents
to 70 cents higher with June at $356.40 a troy ounce; silver was
0.1 cent to 0.5 cent higher with June at $5.012 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Asbestos Fund Exploring Ways To Ease Shortfall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The trust created in Manville Corp.'s bankruptcy
to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases said Monday it
is exploring alternatives to ease a cash shortage that could delay
some payments until the 21st century.
   John C. Sawhill, chairman of the Manville Personal Injury
Settlement Trust, issued a statement that the trust wants ``to
quickly resolve the current legal issues and return (its) attention
to settling claims.''
   The statement did not specify alternatives being examined by the
trust.
   The trust said it has in the past rejected money-raising methods
including insurance-type deferred settlements, investment and asset
management options, sale of part of its Manville stock and
borrowing money.
   On Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge appointed New York
attorney Leon Silverman, one of the architects of Manville's
reoganization plan, to find ways of restructuring the $2.5 billion
trust.
   Earlier this month, a federal judge and a New York state judge
ordered the bankruptcy court to overhaul the trust. One change
would be in a widely criticized payment method that compensates
most claimants on the basis of when their lawsuit is filed.
   The trust was criticized because of a cash shortage induced by
more cases, larger payouts and quicker settlements than expected.
It has said some claimants filing this year will not get paid until
the year 2025.
   The trust was formed as a separate legal entity in Manville's
1988 reorganization, six years after the Denver company was driven
into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over production of asbestos. Its
main asset is ownership of a majority of Manville stock.
   ``The parties are talking about what can be done in this
situation,'' said Theodore Kleinman, the trust's chief financial
officer. ``Every possible alternative will be visited in the course
of that exploration. We're very anxious to try to do what's right
here.''
   Manville was the nation's largest maker of asbestos, the
insulation and building material found to cause severe and
sometimes fatal illnesses. Manville to date has settled more than
22,000 claims by victims but still has more than 130,000 pending.
   In the statement, the trust said it has received $958 million
from Manville and its insurers to date. It said it has paid out
$739 million, $638 million of that directly to claimants.
   Of some $219 million in cash on hand as of March 30, $113
million already is committed to paying claims over the next year.
The rest of the money is designated for prior settlement claims,
legal expenses and operations costs.
   The trust has said it will have no new income until Manville
makes its first annual $75 million payment to the trust next year.

   Korean Air signed a $4.8 billion order Monday
for 23 Boeing 747-400s, the third-largest order ever received by
Boeing Co. in terms of contract value.
   The contract includes spare parts and training and commits
Korean Air to more of Boeing's most sophisticated and
highest-capacity jetliners than any other carrier except Japan Air
Lines. JAL has signed up for 40 of the world's largest passenger
jets.
   The Korean order is the third multibillion-dollar purchase of
Boeing aircraft in as many weeks. The others also were from Asian
air carriers: a $2 billion order from the Chinese government and a
$3.1 billion order from Japan Air Lines.
   Boeing has received single orders for more planes, but only two
exceed the Korean Air order in dollar value: an April 1989 order by
Irish aircraft leasing company GPA Ltd. worth $9.4 billion for 182
planes, and a $7.11 billion deal for 180 planes placed a week later
by United Airlines.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, told
a news conference that the order reflects the fact that traffic
growth in the Pacific has been higher than in either the United
States or Europe.
   He also said the 747-400s, which will be equipped to carry 392
passengers each, are best suited to meet the region's long-range
flights and high-capacity needs.
   Korean Air recently added long-range routes between Seoul and
Moscow, Sydney, Toronto and Vancouver.
   Korean Air Senior Executive Vice President C.H. Cho said the
airline also has contracts for eight other 747-400s by 1994. It
already has three in service.
   Cho said negotiations were under way to determine which engines
the new planes would use. He said Korea produces some parts for the
747, but the purchase is not dependent upon continued use of
Korean-made items.
   Korean Ambassador Park Tong Jin said the purchase represented a
``sincere effort to reduce'' the country's trade surplus with the
United States.
   Boeing officials said 307 of the Seattle company's 747-400s have
been ordered, with 71 so far delivered to airlines around the world.
   The 747-400 can fly more than 8,000 miles nonstop. The planes
normally sell for $116 million to $136 million each, but officials
said the Korean Air price reflects the estimated value of the
dollar at the time of delivery.

<HEAD>Mulheren Prosecution Rests Its Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution rested its case Monday in the
federal securities fraud trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., a former
associate of convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
   The defense then began its presentation in U.S. District Court
by calling three prominent businessmen as character witnesses.
   Mulheren, 40, of Rumson, N.J., is charged with 41 counts of
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping
violations involving his friendship with Boesky.
   He is accused of scheming with Boesky to manipulate the price of
Gulf &amp; Western Inc. stock and concealing ownership of other stocks
to help Boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federal securities laws.
   The first defense witness was Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman
and chief executive officer of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., who said
Mulheren was a friend and business associate.
   ``I would trust everything I have to John Mulheren,'' Greenberg
said during questioning by Mulheren's attorney, Thomas Puccio.
   The other defense witnesses were Samuel Belzberg, chairman of
First City Financial Corp. in Canada, and Jack Nash, the former
chairman of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. _ both of whom described Mulheren as
honest and honorable.
   The high point of the government's case was the three-day
appearance last month of Boesky, who was the main witness against
Mulheren.
   Boesky paid $100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to one
felony to settle the biggest insider trading case ever. In
exchange, he gave government investigators incriminating
information about a number of his associates.
   Mulheren's trial began with jury selection May 14. The
government presented testimony from about 18 witnesses over three
weeks.
   Other prosecution witnesses included Boesky's former head
trader, Michael Davidoff, and Mark Davis, the chairman of Paramount
Communications Inc.
   The prosecution on Monday also rested its case against
Mulheren's co-defendant, Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader at
Mulheren's firm, Jamie Securities. He is charged with conspiracy
and record-keeping violations.

<HEAD>Nation's No. 2 Bank Has Rating Lowered Over Real Estate Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern about Chase Manhattan Corp.'s exposure
to the nation's shaky real estate market triggered a downgrading of
the credit rating of the nation's second-largest bank Monday.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was lowering it ``any
incremental effect'' on Chase's costs because the bank has little
need to borrow long-term funds, Rautenberg said.
   Thomas H. Hanley, a banking analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.,
agreed. Although the bank's long-term debt was downgraded, its
commercial paper rating was left unchanged, he noted. Banks are
major issuers of commercial paper to obtain short-term funds.
   The nation's banks are likely to be plagued by a weak real
estate market for some time to come, Hanley said. ``I don't see any
quick turnaround,'' he said.
   Moody's lowered its rating on senior debt of Chase Manhattan
Corp., the holding company, to Baa2 from Baa1. The rating on
long-term deposits of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., the main banking
subsidiary, was lowered to A3 from A2. Ratings on other long-term
debt of the holding company and its subsidiaries was dropped one
notch.
   Tanya Azarchs, a vice president at S&amp;P, said her agency hasn't
changed its ratings on Chase but was reviewing major banks largely
because of the sluggish real estate market. ``It's a situation that
does disturb us,'' she said.

<HEAD>NBC Plans to Implement Union-Rejected Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC said Monday it will implement a proposed
four-year contract rejected last month by members of the network's
major union. The network said the contract would go into effect
June 20.
   Although no new negotiations were scheduled, ``we're optimistic
that something will be worked (out) before that June 20 date,''
said John Krieger, a spokesman for the union, the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.
   The union, which says it has 2,373 members at NBC and NBC-owned
operations, struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout that lasted 17
weeks.
   No walkout is imminent in the current dispute. Union members
have not taken a strike authorization vote and are continuing to
work, Krieger said.
   ``We're hopeful we can bring a resolution to this before
(contract) implementation,'' he said.
   The union's members, in balloting conducted in April and May,
overwhelmingly rejected NBC's March 30 contract offer; 1,601 to 354.
   The main issues are job security and jurisdiction, Krieger said.
The majority of NABET's 1,300 members are engineers and
technicians. The union also represents newswriters, couriers,
building maintenance employees and operations directors.
   NBC says its offer establishes parity with union contracts in
force at CBS and ABC.
   NBC has told NABET it would consider a small number of modest
changes in its offer if that would lead to speedy union
ratification, network spokesman Joe Rutledge said Monday.
   However, he said the union, in its last meeting with management
May 16, ``told us they consider further talks to be futile.''
   Rutledge and Krieger said the contract talks did not cover a new
24-hour news service to NBC affiliate stations that NBC plans to
start in January.

<HEAD>Air Force Ends Contract Ban on Hughes Missile Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has lifted its suspension of
business with Hughes Aircraft Co.'s missile unit, which resulted
from the company's dealing in secret Pentagon documents, Hughes
said Monday.
   The division was barred May 9 from bidding on programs and
receiving new government contracts in a case stemming from Hughes'
guilty pleas to two federal counts last March.
   Hughes admitted its executives trafficked in secret Pentagon
documents to gain a competitive edge. It was fined $3.6 million.
   At the time of the suspension, the government had threatened to
bar the missile division from bidding on new work for up to three
years.
   Prosecutors said the documents were obtained by a marketing
executive at Hughes' missile group. Hughes said that, in settling
the case, it had agreed to tighten security, change procedures for
marketing operations and conduct a marketing training program.
   It also agreed to continue a companywide ethics program
established several years ago.
   The criminal plea entered by Hughes was part of the large
``Operation Undercover'' criminal probe, in which GTE, Boeing and
RCA also entered guilty pleas.

   The stock market snapped out of last week's
slump Monday with a rally led by blue chips.
   But trading set its slowest pace in more than two months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 38.59 points last
week, rebounded 30.19 to 2,892.57.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
918 up, 563 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 119.55 million
shares, down from 142.60 million in the previous session and the
lightest total since a 114.97 million-share day on April 9.
   Analysts said traders were doing some selective
``bargain-hunting'' in the blue chips while they awaited a broad
array of economic reports due from the government this week.
   Among the monthly statistics on the agenda for Wall Street are
the producer price index of finished goods, due on Thursday, and
the consumer price index and the nation's trade balance, both on
Friday.
   If all goes as expected, brokers say, the data will support the
popular view that economic growth is plodding along at a pace slow
enough to permit inflation and interest rates to ease.
   However, they add, any surprises in the numbers could unsettle
some of the optimism generated during the rally that carried stock
prices to new highs as recently as last Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 145.41 million shares.
   Boeing led the active list, up 3 at 58{ on turnover of more than
2.3 million shares. The stock, which was split 3-for-2 effective
with Monday's trading, reponded to word of a $4.8 billion order
from Korean Airlines for Boeing 747-400 jets.
   Energy stocks attracted buyers after dropping last week in line
with falling oil prices. Exxon gained ~ to 47~; Chevron 1&lsqb; to 70|;
Atlantic Richfield 2 to 116~; Amoco ~ to 51{, and Texaco &rsqb; to 57~.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, International Business Machines
rose 1&lsqb; to 119~; Coca-Cola { to 44{; General Motors | to 49&lsqb;;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph \ to 42\, and DuPont { to 39|.
   Microcom Inc. tumbled 8{ to 9} as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. Late Friday the company projected a loss
for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, saying major domestic
distributors were overstocked with its software and modem products.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.14 billion, or
0.64 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.37 to 197.42.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.79 to 421.22, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.92 at 361.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.92 to 462.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 362.32, up 1.15.

   One of every six jobs created through the turn
of the century is expected to be in California, reflecting the
continued shift of economic activity to the Sun Belt, the
government said Monday.
   ``California is projected to gain 3.4 million of the 18.9
million new jobs created nationally'' from 1988 to 2000, said the
forecast by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
   That would give the state 19 million jobs.
   ``Florida and Texas are projected to have increases of more than
1 million jobs each,'' to 8 million and 9.7 million respectively,
the department said.
   National employment opportunities are expected to rise 14.3
percent to 151.5 million jobs.
   The study projected that the fastest job growth will be in
Nevada, up 31.5 percent to 847,000, and Arizona, up 26.7 percent to
2.3 million. Those two states also should show the fastest growth
rates in total personal income and population, the department said.
   ``The projected growth in Nevada and Arizona reflects rapid
population growth and strength in their economies, in part due to
the continued shift in economic activity toward the Sun Belt,'' the
study said. ``Florida, Utah, California and Hawaii also are
projected to show rapid growth.''
   California will continue to be the nation's most populous state,
growing 17.1 percent to 33.2 million people. It also will be first
in total personal income, up 33 percent to $568 billion.
   Personal income will jump 46.2 percent to $21.7 billion in
Nevada and 40.6 percent to $59 billion in Arizona.
   Total U.S. personal income is expected to advance 26.2 percent
to $4.11 trillion. The income projections are adjusted for
inflation and stated in terms of dollars of 1982 buying power.
   Connecticut is projected to continue having the highest average
per capita income, rising 10.8 percent to $20,503. Mississippi,
although gaining 19.0 percent, is expected to still be last, with
$10,631.
   The national average will be an estimated $15,345, an increase
of 15.9 percent.
   The population in Nevada is projected to rise the fastest, 29.8
percent, to 1.4 million. If the projection proves to be true,
Arizona will be next, with its population rising 21.4 percent to
4.2 million. Florida would be third, up 18.2 percent to 14.6
million.
   The national growth rate is expected to be 8.9 percent, with the
nation having 268 million in the year 2000.
   Populations are projected to increase in every state except
Wyoming, Louisiana and West Virginia, expected to post declines of
1.0 percent, 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange recovered
from an early setback to stand marginally higher at the end of
Tuesday's morning session, and the dollar retreated against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell almost 260 points
in early trading, recovered to stand 2.07 points higher at
32,542.25. The index dropped 453.11 points on Monday.
   The dollar was changing hands at 153.84 yen at late morning,
down from an opening of 154.38 yen and off from Monday's close of
154.10 yen. It ranged between 153.80 yen and 154.45 yen during
morning trading.
   Yoshio Ogawa, chief dealer of Nikko Securities Co., attributed
the Nikkei's early decline to arbitrage selling, in which investors
attempt to take profits between the spot and futures markets.
   ``After a round of sellings, though, traders started buying
underpriced issues,'' Ogawa said.
   The yen's early weakness against the dollar also prompted some
selling, he added, but strength in the bond market provided support.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
87.59 points from Monday's close of 87.18. The gain pushed the
yield down to 7.055 percent from 7.14 percent.
   Ogawa said many traders remained cautious ahead of the release
of the Bank of Japan's Tankan, or short-term economic forecast,
scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's decline to technical
adjustments. Most participants didn't want to trade actively ahead
of a series of releases of key U.S. economic indicators this week,
they said.
   Figures for U.S. retail sales, producer and consumer prices in
May and trade figures for April are due to be released this week in
Washington.
