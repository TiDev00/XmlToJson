<HEAD>NEA Firms Stand Against Academic Tracking, Says Minorities Suffer</HEAD>

   Grouping students based on past
performance keeps underachievers down and lumps minorities into
classes that can prevent them from realizing their potential, the
nation's largest teachers union says.
   So-called academic tracking should be abolished, a National
Education Association report issued today said.
   Academic tracking has become a hot educational issue as U.S.
students continue to test poorly in basic subjects. The report was
issued in conjunction with the annual convention of the union
representing 2 million educators.
   Opponents complain that minorities are too often placed into low
ability and special education classes. Proponents argue tracking is
needed so high achievers can move rapidly.
   NEA vice president Robert Chase said it would be ``foolhardy and
unrealistic to expect that tracking can be eliminated overnight,''
but he said the union will offer strategies to better arrange class
groupings.
   The report, based on a commissioned Johns Hopkins University
study, said students can benefit from tracking, but only under very
specific conditions.
   Students should be grouped only for specific skills, like
reading, rather than by general ability, it said. Also, group
assignments should be frequently reassessed.
   The report said most schools track students by segregating them
all or most of the day based on general achievement or behavior,
rather than by abilities in specific subjects.
   The study found that groupings in elementary and secondary
schools are hard to break out of and are likely to create racially
identifiable classes.
   Also, the study said minorities are significantly
underrepresented in so-called ``gatekeeper classes,'' prerequisites
to higher level courses.
   Without these courses, the study noted, many students are
prevented from pursuing careers in advanced fields like science and
engineering.
   Two years ago, the union adopted a resolution calling for an end
to academic tracking ``based on socio-economic status, race, or
sex.'' Today's report came from a task force appointed then to
study the issue further.

   The archbishop of this smog-choked city
has asked Roman Catholic faithful to pray for rain to relieve air
pollution.
   In a statement published by local newspapers Friday, Monsignor
Carlos Oviedo asked Catholics to pray ``for the needed rain and to
actively cooperate with the measures being ordered by the (city's)
anti-pollution commission.''
   Authorities say a downpour is badly needed to clean the air,
which has been thick for several weeks with fumes from motor
vehicles and factories.
   Since last week, the government has imposed a series of
emergency measures that include banning 40 percent of all cars,
trucks and buses from downtown. Hospitals have reported a sharp
increase in cases of respiratory disease.
   No significant rainfall has been recorded in the Santiago area
since last year. Besides aggravating the smog problem, the dry
weather also threatens to produce a water shortage, authorities say.

<HEAD>Bush Shares Credit With Gorbachev for NATO Initiative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is sharing credit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for NATO's decision to tone down its war-fighting
doctrine, saying the embattled Soviet leader is entitled to declare
``I've been right'' in dealing with the West.
   Bush said Gorbachev can boast that the 16-nation NATO alliance
agreed to overhaul its strategy in direct response to
Soviet-sanctioned democratic changes in Eastern Europe.
   At the same time, Bush observed, ``It was the United States'
draft that shaped the new direction for NATO.''
   Gorbachev ``should get on the offensive'' against Soviet critics
who are angry over the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the pullback
of Red Army troops, Bush suggested Friday at the conclusion of
NATO's two-day summit.
   Bush was in high spirits as he flew here for two days of
diplomatic meetings and Texas-style celebrations before opening the
annual economic summit of the seven largest industrial powers
Monday.
   The president jetted to Houston on a 10-hour nonstop flight from
London and the NATO meeting, which swiftly agreed to his blueprint
for changes in Western military doctrine to reflect the reduced
military threat from Moscow.
   Relaxing against the side of a seat on Air Force One, Bush could
barely conceal his delight. ``You saw what happened to U.S.
influence today,'' he said, pointing to the NATO communique which
incorporated his proposals.
   Despite his upbeat mood, Bush refused anew to declare the Cold
War over.
   ``I've tried to avoid code words,'' he said at a post-summit
news conference. ``The Cold War being over is something that I'd
rather not comment on.
   ``I don't think we're dealing in terms of victory and defeat,''
he continued. ``We're dealing in terms of how do we stabilize and
guarantee the peace and security of Europe.''
   Acting on Bush's suggestions, NATO agreed to shrink its arsenal
of battlefield nuclear weapons _ in tandem with Soviet action _ and
relegate them to highly unlikely last-resort use.
   The NATO leaders also said that ``once negotiations begin on
short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will propose, in return
for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all
its nuclear artillery shells from Europe.''
   They also decided to field smaller and restructured ground
forces, in the newest sign that NATO's 40-year job of containing
potential Soviet-bloc aggression was nearing a successful end.
   At his news conference, Bush said that Gorbachev could point to
the NATO meeting and say, ``They have now changed their doctrine
because of steps that I, Mr. Gorbachev have taken.''
   ``If I were him,'' Bush said, ``I'd say, `I've been right.'''
   The president said he would discuss the NATO meeting with
Gorbachev in a telephone call over the next couple weeks. Aboard
his plane, the president said he recently received a communication
from Gorbachev. But Bush merely winked and smiled when asked to
elaborate.
   Despite prodding from some allies, Bush said he was not ready to
join West Germany and perhaps others in rushing financial aid to
Moscow to prop up Gorbachev and his sickly economy. Financial
assistance for the Soviet Union is expected to be a major topic of
discussion at the economic summit.
   ``I have some big problems with that one and I think the
American people do,'' Bush said.
   ``If the Germans decide they want to do that, that's their
business,'' he said. ``But I have made very clear to those who have
spoken to me about this that at this juncture, we have some serious
problems, and I've not been under any false colors about that at
all.''
   He said, for example, the Soviet Union is spending too much
money on its military. Bush also complained that Moscow is paying a
$5 billion subsidy to Cuba each year ``to sustain a totalitarian
regime that is highly critical of the Soviet Union from time to
time.''
   While objecting to direct financial aid, Bush said, ``Perhaps
there are ways we can assist them as we go forward with credit or
other matters before we go to direct government loans.''

   Here is a list of some of the worst industrial accidents along
the Texas coast over the past half century:
   _ July 5, 1990: Seventeen die in an explosion at the Arco
Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, near Houston.
   _ Oct. 23, 1989: An explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co.
plastics plant on the Houston Ship Channel killed 23 and injured
130.
   _ Nov. 5, 1985: Two men were killed when the Warren Petroleum
plant at Mont Belvieu exploded. An additional 150 workers reached
safety only minutes before the facility, owned by Chevron U.S.A.,
ignited in a ball of flame hundreds of feet high.
   _ Oct. 13, 1981: Six workers were killed in a explosion of a
polyethylene plant owned by Dow Chemical Co. in Freeport.
   _ Dec. 27, 1977: An explosion at the Farmer's Export Co. grain
elevator on the Galveston docks took the lives of 18 workers. Grain
dust, ignited by a spark, caused a flash fire.
   _ Feb. 22, 1976: An explosion and fire at the Goodpasture Inc.
grain elevator killed nine.
   _ Nov. 8, 1959: The tanker Amoco Virginia exploded and burned
while docked at the Hess Terminal on the ship channel. Eight people
were killed.
   _ April 16, 1947: The worst industrial accident in U.S. history
occurred when the French ship Grandcamp exploded while docked at
Texas City. The vessel was loaded with ammonia nitrate fertilizer.
The next day, another fertilizer-laden ship, the High Flyer, also
blew up. Authorities said 576 people were killed and 5,000 were
injured.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bearing the offer of a non-aggression pact and a
pledge to cut German forces, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner
is heading for Moscow on the alliance's most hopeful mission yet
for allaying Soviet fears about German unification and decades of
East-West enmity.
   A day after Woerner arrives in the Soviet capital on July 14,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will also meet with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The visits reflect a stepped-up drive by the Western allies to
develop new ties and pacts with the Soviet Union following NATO's
dramatic revamping of its longstanding military strategy at a
summit which ended Friday in London.
   ``The London Declaration transforms our relationship with old
adversaries,'' declared President Bush, who drafted the new
doctrine. ``To those governments who confronted us in the Cold War,
our alliance extends the hand of friendship.''
   In a communique, the 16 NATO leaders pledged to reduce sharply
both nuclear and conventional defenses in Europe and said they held
``no aggressive intentions'' toward the Soviet Union. They promised
they ``will never in any circumstance be the first to use force.''
   In Moscow, Gorbachev said he was ready to accept an invitation
from the London summit to address a NATO meeting, probably in
December.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze welcomed the
summit's outcome, saying the ``decisions ...move in the right
direction and pave the way to a safe future for the entire European
continent.''
   Bush, headed for Houston aboard Air Force One when informed of
Shevardnadze's comments, replied: ``That's very interesting. And
very positive.''
   But it remained unclear whether the alliance's solemn pledges
would be enough to persuade Gorbachev to drop his objections to a
united Germany being a member of NATO.
   ``I would like to see the tangible response be an acceptance of
the concept that a unified Germany in NATO is not only good but
that it certainly is no threat to them,'' said Bush.
   Kohl called the commitment to cut German troop levels ``an
indispensable signpost along the path leading to German unity.''
   ``This is a wide-ranging offer,'' said Kohl of NATO's new
stance. ``This is NATO offering a hand.''
   The NATO leaders committed themselves to decide on a troop level
for a unified Germany by the autumn.
   The new reduced level will then become part of the next round of
negotiations with the Soviets on lower overall troop levels for
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Bonn's defense minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, has agreed to cut
more than 160,000 from the current combined forces of West and East
Germany, down to 400,000. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
has said an even greater cut _ to 350,000 troops _ is acceptable.
   At the summit, the allies also agreed to the eventual
elimination of all nuclear artillery shells in Europe in return for
``reciprocal action'' from the Soviet Union. And they decided to
field smaller and restructured ground forces.
   In a switch in strategy that upset France and had made Britain
uneasy, the NATO leaders relegated nuclear weapons to being weapons
of ``last resort.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand objected, saying NATO
should stick to its longtime doctrine that it might use nuclear
weapons to repel an overwhelming Soviet conventional attack.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came round to the
concept after insisting that the communique stress NATO retains the
option of using nuclear weapons. She also said ``last resort'' was
sufficient now that the crumbling Warsaw Pact has lost the ability
to mount a surprise attack.
   ``At long last we have the chance to make for the first time in
history military aggression in Europe materially impossible and
also politically meaningless,'' declared Woerner.

   President Virgilio Barco, in an effort
to track down drug traffickers and criminals, has decreed that all
Colombians must register with police.
   Newspaper columnists criticized the Friday decree, saying the
information could be used by drug traffickers to locate people.
   Colombia's top ranking army and police officers have repeatedly
said the security forces include informants to the drug traffickers.
   The presidential decree noted that ``members of the armed forces
have been retired or charged in cases where they have been linked
to illegal acts.''
   Friday's decree requires the head of each family to inform
police of the names of family members, their address, telephone
number and places of work.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is the second
world leader to delay his arrival for the seven-nation economic
summit because of more pressing business _ the World Cup soccer
finals.
   Even before his country was eliminated from the tournament,
Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti pushed back his arrival in
order to present the trophy to the winning team after Sunday's
final match.
   Now with his country in the finals, Kohl has decided he would
rather be in the stands in Rome watching his team play Argentina
than attending a rodeo hosted by President Bush for the Western
leaders in Houston.
   Both Kohl and Andreotti now plan to arrive in Houston early
Monday, only hours before the official arrival ceremonies at Rice

   In a bow to the black-tie set, President Bush and his wife have
decided to attend a Houston Grand Opera performance of ``Carousel.''
   The president had long before set up a Sunday entertainment
schedule that reinforced a quite different notion of Texas culture:
a rodeo and barbeque topped by a rare out-of-Nashville performance
by the Grand Ol' Opry.
   But on Thursday, to the excitement of the Grand Opera staff _
not to be confused with the Nashville bunch _ Bush added a matinee
of the Rodgers and Hammerstein production to his schedule.

   Speaking of the rodeo.
   When Bob Tallman was told that he had been chosen to be the
announcer for Sunday's rodeo, he told a friend, ``I''ll be there if
they have to take me in a wheelchair.''
   They do.
   At a Nevada rodeo last month, Tallman was showing the crowd how
to ``spur a bucking horse out'' when a paper plate flew out of the
stands and spooked his horse.
   In the ensuing fall, Tallman broke his shoulder and fractured a
leg in three places.
   So when Bush and his VIP entourage see a 45-minute rodeo
demonstration Sunday, Tallman will be at the mike _ announcing the
event from his wheelchair.

   Lady Bird Johnson may be remembered as the first lady whose love
of flowers enriched the nation's capitol, but for the next week,
Barbara Bush can lay claim to her own beautification program.
   In honor of Mrs. Bush, the Garden Club of Houston donated
hundreds of pots of white periwinkles to dot the campus of Rice
University, where the summit leaders will meet.
   The garden club had hoped the flowers could be made a permanent
addition to the university landscape, but unfortunately Rice
officials turned down that offer, saying they did not have the
staff to water them after the summit is over.

   Watchout, Houston. Gridlock is just around the next freeway bend.
   Many of the city's main arteries will be shut down for blocks of
time during the summit as the world leaders make their way to
important meetings. That's enough to make commuters grumble.
   Now the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secret Service
are restricting traffic helicopters for security reasons.
   ``This is going to be the worst traffic in Houston's history,''
John Winder of Metro Traffic said Friday. ``Probably for the first
time we are going to approach gridlock. And that's without the
normal stuff.''
   ``It's going to be a mess,'' added Gary Elliott of a competing
service called Traffic Central.
   Restrictions that took effect Friday evening barred aircraft
from flying below 3,000 feet within an area about eight miles
around Rice University, site of the economic summit. Traffic
reporters normally fly between 300 feet and 1,500 feet.

   The lights of Damascus twinkled through the
windows of a French nightclub. British businessmen sipped Danish
beer poured by Palestinian waiters. A singer warbled her way
through ``Georgia On My Mind.''
   The performer was Polish, of course.
   Poles may be struggling with economic troubles at home, but in
the Middle East, musicians from the Eastern European nation are in
high demand.
   They seem to be everywhere: Playing Scottish music at a Burns
Night dinner in Jordan. Hammering out rock favorites in Dubai
saloons. Playing Chopin in Syrian piano bars.
   In a Kuwait hotel steakhouse, a Polish band romped through a
more or less American classic: ``Dee starrs at night are shining
bright, deep in dee harrt of Taxes.''
   The singer's accent was closer to Warsaw than West Texas. But
the fiddle player could toss a bow with the best in Austin.
   Even the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro was carrying a
complement of Polish dancers when it was hijacked in 1985.
   Polish entertainers have acquired the sort of reputation for low
cost and quality that Polish industry is striving to win.
   ``We're good ... and we're not too expensive,'' said Beata
Lewtak, hired to sing with a Jordanian band at an Amman hotel.
   Robert Lillis, assistant general manager of Amman's
Intercontinental Hotel, agreed.
   ``It's cheaper for us to hire Poles than to hire other European
or American musicians,'' he said.
   ``We know what we're getting with the Poles,'' he said. ``The
standard of music and the range of music are excellent.''
   This victory on the musical free market is a legacy of Poland's
crumbling Socialist system. Ms. Lewtak and most other Polish
musicians are graduates of special music academies, which give
intensive training grounded in the classics.
   Many musicians began playing jazz and rock outside class, often
to the disapproval of their elders.
   ``In the '50s, jazz was forbidden in Poland,'' said Tadeusz
Toczyski, who played recently at the Meridien Hotel in Damascus.
   But now schools have begun to teach the new styles.
   ``I like jazz best,'' said Tadeusz Kasproak, whose Veto Band
played at Amman's Intercontinental. ``But when I'm playing with an
electronic automatic drummer, it's impossible.''
   Many touring bands find themselves playing everything from light
classical music to disco to regional songs.
   ``This kind of job is the most difficult because you have to be
good enough to play any kind of music they want,'' said Toczyski,
from Krakow.
   ``In Poland you can find a lot of good musicians. For many
years, the main reason that Polish musicians went out was to make
the money to buy electronic instruments,'' Toczyski said.
   Kasproak and his band rely heavily on costly foreign instruments
such as keyboards and synthesizers. He has traveled off and on for
almost a decade.
   ``Nobody in Poland can afford such equipment,'' said Kasproak,
who plays guitar, trombone and piano.
   Kasproak, his vocalist wife Anna and keyboardist Andryej
Niescior, all from Lublin, played in Finland, Hungary and
Yugoslavia before coming to Jordan.
   But many musicians said they were worried by hardships at home.
Poland ended 40 years of Communist Party rule last year. The
Solidarity-led government has implemented market reforms that have
fueled unemployment and inflation.
   ``What has changed for us is only the prices,'' Ms. Lewtak said.
``Before I had a lot of money. Now I have nothing.''
   She also said working abroad brought its own hardships.
   ``I have my husband, my daughter at home. All the time I think
of them,'' she said.
   ``In time,'' Kasproak said, ``maybe work will be good for us in
Poland.''

   Beneath a naked bluff on a mile-long Boston Harbor
island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked
graves of about 4,100 early immigrants whose American dreams ended
in death.
   Most were famine-weakened Irish who fled their starving country
in the mid-1800s only to be deemed ``undesirable'' and detained on
Deer Island, where they died and until now were largely forgotten.
   ``They symbolize all immigrants that have come to Boston and to
America,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn said this week. ``They may have been
poor, probably didn't have any family and weren't among the elite.
   ``But still every respect should be afforded to their memory.''
   Residents of Boston, home to more Irish-Americans per capita
than any other U.S. city, are resurrecting the city's missing
chapter.
   Deer Island's low-security jail is scheduled to close in 1991
and local business, labor and other groups plan to have the
gravesite landscaped by 1995, the 150th anniversary year of the
potato famine.
   The mayor has announced plans to erect a Celtic cross on the
island and a statue near Fanueil Hall as part of the city's ``Great
Hunger Memorial Project,'' the nation's first memorial to Irish
famine victims _ and victims of hunger around the world.
   The graves on the island about four miles from Boston's wharves
came to Flynn's attention several months ago, after construction
workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site.
   ``You think of them getting this far, coming across the Atlantic
and being able to look over and see the city ... only to end up in
an anonymous pauper's grave,'' said Francis J. Costello, the
mayor's adviser on Irish-American Affairs. ``We have to put a
proper finish on this.''
   Many of the thousands of immigrants held on Deer Island
eventually made it to a new life on the mainland. But thousands
more were buried in shallow, lime-lined trenches that held eight or
10 bodies each.
   Their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but
never reached America's shores.
   Ireland's population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal
disease, starvation and emigration after a devastating plant
disease hit the country's staple potato crop in 1845.
   During the next 10 years, more than 152,000 Irish fled to
Boston, many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no
longer could afford to pay rent.
   The Yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless, weak
and diseased immigrants, many of whom were near death after a month
or more aboard the crowded ``coffin ships'' they had taken across
the Atlantic.
   ``As a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would
have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city,''
a quarantine hospital was established on Deer Island, according to
a Massachusetts Senate document dated 1848.
   Paupers and inmates also were held on the island because
officials deemed them, like the Irish and a fraction of immigrants
from other countries, ``undesirable within the core urban area,''
according to city documents.
   ``It was really a human dump heap,'' said Dennis P. Ryan, author
of ``Beyond The Ballot: A Social History of the Boston Irish.''
   Several rough-hewn wooden crosses stood for years on the bluff
near the graves, but by about 1970 they had disappeared or
disintegrated. A lone white Celtic cross also was erected amid the
yellow rapeseed, but that too is gone.
   ``It wasn't a deep dark secret,'' said Deborah Cox, president of
the Public Archaeology Laboratory Inc. in Pawtucket, R.I.
   ``I think it was just one of those things people don't pay
attention to and then eventually forget,'' said Cox, whose company
surveyed Deer Island before construction began on the new sewage
treatment plant in late 1988.
   Boston's archivist, Edward Quill, has begun researching death
records and handwritten weekly logs kept by physicians at Deer
Island's quarantine hospital.
   For years the records have gathered dust, now they'll be
available to genealogists and other researchers. Several Flynns
have turned up among the 872 names Quill has traced.
   ``It could well have been any immigrant group that has come to
our country,'' said Mayor Flynn. ``That's why we need a symbol, a
decent resting place ... so their history won't be forgotten.''

   The world's three greatest tenors _ ``they each have
a Stradivarius in their throat,'' says maestro Zubin Mehta _ have
set aside egos to sing together for the first time.
   Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti _ in
alphabetical order, please _ will sing tonight under the stars and
amid the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla in a charity sendoff to
the World Cup soccer championship.
   ``Music and sport are the most universal things in the world,''
Domingo said at a news conference Friday.
   The concert is scheduled to follow the consolation match between
the national squads of host team Italy and England to determine
third place in the monthlong competition. The champion will be the
winner of Sunday's game in Rome between Argentina and West Germany.
   If the Italy-England game, in Bari, goes into overtime, the
tenors will have to wait in the wings until the last kick. Both
events will be broadcast live to hundreds of millions of television
spectators around the world.
   The three tenors, who will be accompanied by two orchestras led
by Mehta, made a big show of their camaraderie at the news
conference at a Rome hotel near the Pantheon.
   ``It's a great challenge for each of us to sing near the other
two,'' Carreras said. ``I don't think it's a competition. On the
contrary, it's an honor.''
   With photographers and camera crews stumbling over each other to
capture the three together, Domingo extended a hand, and the other
two tenors and Mehta each put a hand on top of the others. The
stout Pavarotti wiped sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief,
poured a glass of mineral water for Carreras, sitting at his side,
and affectionately patted him on the head at one point.
   After an opening orchestral rendition of Giuseppe Verdi's ``I
Vespri Siciliani,'' the tenors will each get a turn, appearing
first in alphabetical order to avoid possible offense to egos, then
alternating the order. Each man has four solos, with Pavarotti
getting the final turn with Nessun Dorma (Nobody Sleep!), from
Giacomo Puccini's ``Turandot.''
   Nessun Dorma ends with a crescendo of ``vincero, vincero,
vincero,'' (I shall win), which Pavarotti sang in a commercial for
Italian state television's coverage of the World Cup and in a
concert in Milan in late May to inaugurate the competition.
   An avid soccer fan, Pavarotti's home team, Italy, failed last
week to make the finals, ``and my heart is bleeding,'' he said.
   For the concert's promoters, the winning moment will be the
show's last 20 minutes, when the three tenors will sing together a
medley of popular songs, including ``O Sole Mio.''
   ``How do you think I feel?'' leading the three tenors, Mehta
asked. ``It's a dream.''
   With the tenors providing enough sonic booms, organizers said,
air traffic officials at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport agreed to
re-route flight paths so planes won't be flying over the
1,800-year-old ruins of the public baths.
   There are only 6,000 seats amid the ruins, where several operas
are performed during the summer, and about 100,000 would-be
concert-goers were left disappointed, organizers said.
   ``There was more pressure to get a ticket to the concert than to
the final of the World Cup on Sunday evening,'' Rome Mayor Franco
Carraro said.
   Sales of tickets _ ranging from $25 to $335 _ yielded $1
million, organizers said.
   The three tenors agreed to sing without pay and will donate to
charity their share of revenues _ from television showings, ticket
sales as well as sales of videos, cassettes and albums from the
concert, which will be recorded.
   ``Our pay is being together in this marvelous musical _ and
human _ circumstance,'' Pavarotti said.
   Domingo, born in Spain but raised in Mexico, said four Mexican
villages devastated by an earthquake in 1985 will benefit from his
share. Carreras, who battled back from leukemia, said he'll donate
his proceeds to foundations fighting the disease. Pavarotti's share
will help benefit sufferers of a variety of diseases as well as a
marrow transplant center in Pesaro, Italy.
   Pavarotti said the three agreed to do it in part because
Carreras, back to the stage after his illness, ``is so exceptional,
and because the soccer championship is such an important moment. It
wouldn't have been possible in any other moment.''

<TEXT>
   Japan goes to the Houston economic summit with a
distinctly Asian view on two issues _ rice and aid to China _ and
with the aim of exerting more influence in world affairs.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu left for the United States Friday
and was to hold talks with President Bush on trade and security
matters before the seven-nation summit starts Monday.
   In his 11 months as prime minister, Kaifu, 59, has sought to
ease trade tensions with the United States, Japan's main ally,
while at the same time improving Tokyo's relations with Europe and
exerting influence at a rate commensurate with Japan's economic
power.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe, waving charts he will
show in Houston, said Japan advanced from 9 percent of world
economic output in 1980 to 14 percent last year, while the U.S.
share crept from 23 percent to 24 percent.
   ``Japan's responsibility worldwide is increasing,'' said
Watanabe, who was forced to admit last year that Japan didn't have
a policy on Eastern Europe because it was so remote from Japanese
concerns.
   The collapse of communism brought a quick change in Tokyo,
however, and Japan has pledged $1.95 billion in aid to Poland and
Hungary.
   ``What was remote decades ago can affect the world, and Japan
has some responsibility ... to act in concert with other
responsible nations,'' Watanabe said at a briefing for foreign
journalists.
   Despite its new political interest in Europe, Japan is conscious
of being the only Asian country at the summit. It will voice some
distinctly Asian concerns at the meeting with leaders from the
United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   ``We are very much interested in drawing the attention of the
other summiteers to what is happening and not happening in this
part of the world,'' Watanabe said. He cited problems in China,
Tibet, Mongolia, Cambodia and the Korean peninsula.
   Kaifu is exected to argue at the summit for an end to the
punitive ban on development loans to China, and if his six
colleagues don't agree, Japan may go ahead alone with its own plan
for massive loans to Beijing.
   At last year's summit in France, China's brutal suppression of a
pro-democracy movement was a vivid memory. The summit participants
agreed on sanctions including a ban on high-level contacts with
Chinese officials and a freeze on development loans.
   Japan has been China's main source of credit and had planned
$5.2 billion in a five-year program of loans. Now, Kaifu and other
Japanese government officials say, it's time to open the credit
window again to avoid isolating China or contributing to economic
unrest there.
   ``China has to know our moral reaction (to last year's violence)
but, if they go into misery and confusion, who's going to suffer?''
Watanabe said.
   Farm trade is expected to come up at the summit ahead of the
December deadline for agreement on the so-called Uruguay Round of
talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Washington has proposed a gradual phasing-out of farm subsidies,
which are high not only in Japan but also in Europe and the United
States.
   Japan's official position is that it is willing to negotiate
rice when its partners put their farm subsidies on the table.
   Kaifu's Cabinet decided Friday on only a tiny decrease in the
subsidy it pays rice producers, signaling that Japan is not
changing its policy on agricultural trade for now.
   Japan bans rice imports, to the dismay of rice farmers in the
United States and Thailand, on grounds that it is the national
staple food. Self-sufficiency in rice is a matter of national
security, the government says.
   Yet within Japan the official position increasingly is coming
under attack, even from Old Guard figures in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party. Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita recently
commended what he called the courage of the opposition Clean
Government Party in suggesting the import ban should be eased.
   There had been suggestions to cut the subsidy by 4 percent or
more. But farmers with small operations are an important
constituency of the governing conservative party, and Friday's 1.5
percent cut was widely seen as a move to maintain their loyalty.

<TEXT>
   The Louisiana House on Friday night
voted to override Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto of the nation's
strongest state abortion bill, which contains no exceptions for
rape or incest.
   The vote was 73-31, three more votes than were needed for a
House veto override.
   The state Senate still had to deal with the veto Roemer issued
earlier in the day. Senators voted 21-18 to adjourn late Friday
rather than vote on an override.
   Sen. Allen Bares conceded on the floor that the bill's backers
didn't have the 26 votes needed to override. The adjournment gave
abortion opponents three days to lobby the Senate. By law, the
Legislature must end its current session Monday night.
   If the Senate also votes to override, it would be the first
override of a gubernatorial veto this century.
   The measure would send doctors who perform abortions to jail for
up to 10 years and fined them up to $100,000. It was written for
the purpose of challenging the 1973 Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion.
   Also Friday, anti-abortion activists in Michigan filed petitions
with more than 330,000 signatures to initiate a bill that would
require girls to have a parent's consent before obtaining an
abortion.
   Roemer signed the veto Friday morning, according to his staff
attorney, John Kennedy.
   In his veto message, Roemer called the issue ``one of the most
wrenching and divisive issues to be faced by this Legislature.''
   He also responded to charges by backers of the bill that he has
changed his position on abortion since he was a congressman,
running for governor, in 1987.
   ``As a member of Congress, I consistently voted to curb abortion
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus,'' Roemer wrote in the
veto message. ``I initially voted for the exception to save the
life of a mother, but over the years of struggling with this issue
I became acutely aware of the need to except those instances where
conception occurred because of rape or incest.
   ``Women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences
of these traumatic, illegal acts.''
   Roemer has repeatedly said he sides with anti-abortion forces
but cannot allow a bill without rape and incest exceptions to
become law.
   At an afternoon news conference, the bill's author, state Rep.
Woody Jenkins, cited statistics showing that of more than 15,000
abortions performed in Louisiana in 1987, only one was done to end
a pregnancy that resulted from rape.
   ``He's for killing 15,000 unborn children a year in Louisiana
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also
killed,'' said Jenkins.
   Robin Rothrock, leader of an abortion rights coalition, said
earlier she remained confident that the Senate would sustain
Roemer's veto.
   ``In the Senate we believe that we still have the 15,'' Rothrock
said, referring to 15 senators who voted against the measure when
it passed the Senate with 24 votes. An override requires a
two-thirds vote in each chamber _ 26 in the Senate and 70 in the
House.
   The House passed the bill last week with 74 votes.
   In Michigan, the Legislature will have 40 days to pass the
veto-proof measure, once the petition signatures are validated.
Failure of the measure would put the issue on the November 1992
statewide ballot as a public referendum.
   Lawmakers passed a similar measure earlier this year but
couldn't override Democratic Gov. James Blanchard's veto.
   A majority of House and Senate members signed the petitions,
said Michigan Right to Life president Barbara Listing.
   The bill would require girls 17 and younger to have a parent's
consent for an abortion or to ask a judge for a waiver on the
grounds that she is mature enough to make her own decision or the
abortion would be in her best interest.

<HEAD>D.C. Mayor's Alleged Drug Buys Detailed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry bought crack cocaine two
dozen times in three months and had the drugs delivered to hotels,
a city government office building or picked them up himself, his
alleged supplier says.
   ``I took him three $30 bags of crack cocaine; that was his
usual,'' Lydia Pearson testified Friday regarding a 1988 visit to a
Washington hotel where she had been summoned by Barry.
   On one occasion, she said, she delivered her application for a
city job along with drugs.
   Pearson, an acknowledged drug addict, told jurors in the mayor's
cocaine and perjury trial that she supplied Barry with crack
``about 25 times'' from July to September in 1988. She met Barry
through former model Rasheeda Moore, a childhood friend of Pearson
who has given five days of testimony at the trial.
   Pearson said Moore and Barry used an upstairs bedroom at her
home three times before their romantic relationship ended in June
1988. When Barry would leave, Moore would be too high from smoking
crack to accompany him down the stairs, she said. Moore ``had begun
to run up a tab'' for drugs and Moore said the mayor was the one
paying it off, the witness added.
   After the affair with Barry ended, Moore ``said that she was
going to get him,'' Pearson testified, suggesting a possible motive
for Moore's cooperation with the government. Moore testified that
she was concerned for the mayor's health, came forward because she
wanted to tell the truth and wasn't seeking revenge against Barry.
   After Moore and the mayor broke up, Barry would telephone
Pearson to ask whether ``everything is all right'' and he would
then tell her when he would stop by, Pearson testified.
   His chauffer-driven limousine would pull up at her home and
Barry would come inside, she said, and ``I would give him the
bags'' of crack ``and he would give me the money.''
   Pearson said she also delivered crack to Barry in a city
government office building, along with an application for a city
job.
   ``He gave me the money'' for the crack and ``I gave him the''
application, she testified. She said the meeting took place in the
office of Barry campaign manager Anita Bonds, who was not there at
the time.
   Pearson eventually did work in a public housing job for the
city, but recently left because of her cocaine addiction. She has
enrolled in drug rehabilitation programs three times over the years.
   Pearson said she never saw Barry use drugs.
   Meanwhile Friday, Barry announced that he would not endorse any
of the five Democrats vying for his job in this November's
election. He urged his loyalists to back the candidate of their
choice.
   Barry announced on June 13 that he would not seek a fourth term.
The 54-year-old mayor is accused of 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug
use.

<HEAD>Tests Begin to Locate Space Shuttle Hydrogen Leaks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critical tests to ferret out the mysterious
hydrogen leak that has grounded America's space shuttle fleet are
starting this weekend.
   Rockwell International, the contractor that built the space
shuttles, will test pipes and valves from space shuttle Columbia
today and Sunday at the company plant in Downey, Calif.
   Engineers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, meanwhile, are
preparing a leak test on Atlantis, a space shuttle on a launch pad.
   William Lenoir, NASA associate administrator for space flight,
said Friday the goal of the tests is to find where a leak developed
in the maze of pipes and valves used to load liquid hydrogen aboard
the shuttles.
   Leaks found in May on Columbia and last week on Atlantis caused
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to ground all
three of the nation's winged spacecraft. The third craft,
Discovery, is scheduled to fly in October if the leak problem is
solved.
   Meanwhile Friday, an investigative board concluded two days of
closed-door hearings here on another major NASA problem, the
focusing flaw that disabled the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   NASA said the panel, led by Lew Allen, director of the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was to determine how a
manufacturer ground and polished the wrong prescription into one of
two focusing mirrors on the telescope. The mistake has caused the
instrument to see the universe as a fuzzy blur.
   The mirrors were manufactured by the Hughes Danbury Optical Co.
of Danbury, Conn., under a $440 million contract that included $11
million in performance awards.
   A report to be published Monday in Aviation Week and Space
Technology magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying NASA was
offered Air Force facilities to test the telescope mirrors 10 years
ago, but the space agency turned down the offer.
   But another trade publication, Space Business News, says in a
story to be published Monday that NASA was blocked from using
Defense Department facilities to test the Hubble mirrors because
the same contractor also was making optics for Air Force spy
satellites.
   Space Business News quotes James Beggs, who was NASA
administrator when the Hubble was being built, as saying that ``the
Air Force wouldn't let us in'' to test the Hubble mirrors or to
even oversee their manufacture.
   Efforts to reach Beggs by telephone for comment were
unsuccessful.
   Lenoir told reporters there is still no estimate about how long
the space shuttles will be grounded. It all depends on how long it
takes to find and fix the hydrogen leaks, he said.
   A leak discovered on Atlantis during a test on the launch pad
last week is similar to one discovered in May on Columbia when that
craft was being loaded with liquid hydrogen in preparation for
launch.
   Columbia was rolled back to the hangar and engineers removed the
elaborate plumbing fixture called the umbilical that is used to
load hydrogen into the shuttle rocket propellant tank. The fixture
was sent to the Rockwell plant in Downey for testing.
   On Sunday, Rockwell engineers plan to pump helium, then liquid
nitrogen and finally the much colder liquid hydrogen through the
umbilical.
   ``If it does leak, we should be able to pinpoint it,'' Lenoir
said.
   A more vigorous test is planned for Atlantis next Friday when
liquid hydrogen is pumped into the spacecraft's tank at a high rate
of flow. Plastic bags will be placed over the various valves, pipes
and seals that are suspected of leaking. Gas captured in the bags
will be analyzed to determine the hydrogen content, Lenoir said.
   ``If we get through all of that and we still can't find a leak,
then in all honesty, we don't know where we'll go,'' he said.
   Engineers earlier suspected that the leaks may have been caused
by a slightly crooked installation of propellant tanks on both
Atlantis and Columbia, but Lenoir said an analysis of the
misalignment determined it could not be responsible for the leak.
   At Rockwell International's assembly plant in Palmdale, Calif.,
meanwhile, power surged Friday for the first time into Endeavour,
the newest member of America's space shuttle fleet.
   A NASA announcement called the power-up ``a major milestone'' in
testing of the new shuttle's electrical system. The spacecraft is
scheduled to be completed in April 1991 and make its first flight
in 1992.

<TEXT>
   Despite a painful left ankle, American sumo
wrestler Konishiki will compete in an upcoming summer tournament in
pursuit of his dream of attaining the 2,000-year-old sport's
highest rank.
   A member of Konishiki's Takasago stable, or training house, said
Friday that the 513-pound Samoan-American intended to participate
in the Nagoya summer tournament beginning Sunday.
   ``It's a real shame. He (Konishiki) would have liked to have
gone in with his full strength,'' the stablemate said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The 26-year-old Konishiki, whose given name is Salevaa Fuauli
Atisanoe, has a good chance of becoming a yokozuna, or grand
champion, if he achieves a high score during the 15-day tournament.
   Konishiki, who is sumo's heaviest wrestler, has been prone to
leg injuries. After being the first foreigner to reach sumo's
second highest rank of ozeki in 1987, he injured his right knee and
performed poorly in several consecutive tournaments.

   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) _ Rep. Joe Kennedy plunged into
shark-infested waters to help rescue two anglers tossed overboard
by a 485-pound marlin, the congressman and his charter boat skipper
say.
   A bloody 300-pound marlin caught earlier by the rescued couple
had drawn the sharks, said the eldest son of the late Sen. Robert
Kennedy.
   ``I don't know if we got many points for intelligence,'' he told
the Boston Herald in a telephone interview Thursday. ``It was tiger
shark city.''
   The aquatic heroics came Sunday as the Massachusetts Democrat
took part in a fishing tournament.
   The crew of his boat heard a radio distress call about three
miles off Kailua-Kona and spotted a man and a woman hanging onto an
overturned fishing boat, said Chuck Harlan, captain of the charter
boat.
   Kennedy and others on the charter boat leapt in the water to
save the couple, Harlan said.
   After the rescue, Harlan grabbed a fishing pole still hooked to
the 485-pound marlin, and the fish eventually was caught.
   Kennedy, 37, said of the incident, ``It was classic `The Old Man
and the Sea' stuff.''

attorneys said.
   The tie-straightening comic known for his refrain ``I get no

accident at Caesars in 1988 and that he was forced to cancel a
series of shows at the casino.
   Attorneys for both sides met in federal court Thursday in an
effort to settle the lawsuit. Caesars attorney Bruce Aguilera said
Friday the two sides failed to reach an agreement, and a trial date
would be set in the case Aug. 1.
   Dangerfield seeks $225,000 in disputed contract money,

   Nathaniel Wyeth, the brother of artist
Andrew Wyeth and the inventor of the plastic soda bottle, died
Wednesday at age 78.
   The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Wyeth was best known for developing the polyethylene
terephthalate, or PET, bottle, in the early 1970s. The bottle is
used for carbonated beverages, wine, liquor and food because of its
light weight and impact resistance.
   It was patented in 1973, and more than 6 million are produced
annually around the world.
   He began his career at Du Pont Co. in 1936 in the Wilmington,
Del., company's engineering department. Wyeth held numerous other
positions before being named the company's first engineering fellow
in 1963. In 1975, he was named as the first senior engineering
fellow, the company's highest technical position.
   Wyeth invented 25 processes and products that spanned a wide
range, including plastics, textile fibers, electronics and
mechanical systems.
   He is survived by his wife, Jean, five sons, his brother, three
sisters, three stepsons and a stepdaughter.

   A man was charged Friday with threatening
Ronald Reagan after scaling the fence at the former president's
Bel-Air home, the Secret Service said.
   Gregory Stuart Gordon, 32, of Los Angeles, was arrested on the
Reagan property on Wednesday, said Assistant Special Agent Joseph
Perez.
   Gordon, who Perez said was unemployed, was being held without
bail on charges of threatening to kill or inflict bodily harm on a
former president.
   Perez refused to give details about the intrusion.
   KCAL-TV, quoting unidentified sources, reported Friday that
Gordon had entered the Reagan residence while the Reagans were
home. The station said Nancy Reagan saw the intruder, but the
former president was in another wing.
   A man who gave his name as Gregory Gordon called The Associated
Press on Thursday night, claiming he had scaled the fence at the
mansion before he was seized by Secret Service agents. He said he
was calling from the county's Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he
had been taken for a psychiatric evaluation.
   The caller said he jumped the fence because he wanted publicity.
He said he believes Reagan is the anti-Christ ``and I'm the second
coming of Christ.''
   The 35-year-old, single-story mansion stands behind a wall and
security fence on a hillside. Other security measures include
surveillance cameras.
   The estate's address was changed from 666 to 668 St. Cloud Drive
because of superstition surrounding the number 666, believed by
some to be a symbol of the devil.
   The home on about an acre of land was bought for the Reagans by
friends in 1986 for $2.5 million. Neighbors include Elizabeth
Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor.

<HEAD>Democrats, GOP Joust Over Soviet Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With cuts in U.S. defense spending at issue,
Democrats and Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee are
drawing battle lines over how much of a military threat the Soviet
Union continues to pose.
   The 17 Democrats on the committee's special Defense Policy Panel
concluded in a report released Friday that the Soviet conventional
threat to the United States and its Western allies is ``greatly
diminished and cannot be revived.''
   Based on that assessment, reductions in defense spending are in
order, they said.
   ``Old assumptions about the Soviet threat don't jibe with
reality anymore,'' Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said.
``Many of the changes are irreversible, and that means we can cut
selectively without jeopardizing our security.''
   But the 15 Republicans on the panel rejected that view as overly
optimistic.
   ``Endorsing this report is tantamount to believing that the
Soviet Union is already militarily impotent and not a global power
to be reckoned with. Such a view is more wishful thinking than a
reflection of reality,'' said Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama,
ranking Republican on the committee.
   The GOP members, in a dissent included in the 310-page report,
cited the absence of a U.S.-Soviet treaty to scale back
conventional forces in Europe, the unclear future of a unified
Germany and the economic and political instability in Eastern
Europe.
   The report cited the testimony of CIA Director William Webster,
who told the Armed Services Committee on March 1 that the lessening
Soviet conventional threat would ``be increasingly difficult to
reverse.''
   Planned withdrawal of Soviet troops from Europe, as announced by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December 1988, will continue as
long as the Kremlin leader remains in power, the report said.
   Even if Gorbachev is replaced, his successor would be forced to
follow the same policies, it said, quoting a U.S. intelligence
assessment.
   ``In short, there has been too much change in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe for the reduction in the threat to be
reversed,'' the report said.
   The Republicans said the House-approved budget that calls for
$296 billion in defense spending for the 1991 fiscal year,
beginning Oct. 1, would carve too much out of the U.S. military.
   President Bush has proposed spending $303 billion on defense in
fiscal 1991.
   ``We believe that the House defense spending figure, which in
percentage terms cuts defense spending three times more than the
president's budget does, is imprudent,'' the GOP members said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Targeting 100 S&amp;Ls for Priority Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is expanding the
priority list of savings and loans to be investigated from 20 to
100, officials say.
   Justice Department prosecutors said Friday they will concentrate
on these institutions as they push ahead with investigations of
scandals that have swept the thrift industry, the officials said.
   The list was drawn up at a three-day meeting in Indianapolis
three weeks ago and represents an expansion of a roster of 20
priority savings and loans, William Fulwider, a spokesman for the
Office of Thrift Supervision, said.
   He said over the last several years over 20,000 ``referrals''
concerning possible criminal activity involving 350 savings and
loans have been sent to the Justice Department in the burgeoning
scandal.
   ``Justice was getting all these criminal referrals but no
prioritization,'' Fulwider said. ``They didn't know which ones ...
we thought they should really go after and concentrate on.''
   The expanded list was drawn up in late June at about the time
President Bush called for doubled spending on savings and loan
fraud and proposed to create ``rapid response teams'' to combat the
problem.
   The administration has been under fire from Democrats on Capitol
Hill who say that it should have done more to jail savings and loan
officials guilty of fraud and recover more of the estimated
hundreds of billions of dollars lost.
   The administration has been pointing to 791 fraud convictions
last year as well as the recovery of $100 million in stolen funds
and 530 active investigations this year.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Timothy Ryan, director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision, were expected to appear on
Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing into
savings and loan enforcement plans.
   The initial list of 20 priority institutions was developed
shortly after Ryan took office in April and met with Thornburgh.
   It was produced by a group of enforcement officials from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Resolution Trust Corp., the
Office of Thrift Supervision and the Justice Department.
   Authorities from the same agencies drew up the expanded list
along with representatives from federal agencies from around the
country, officials said.
   They said it would be improper to disclose the names of the
institutions on the list. Some of them already have been seized by
the government and some have not, Fulwider said.
   Officials said the list was presented several days ago to James
G. Richmond, the Justice Department's newly appointed special
counsel for savings and loan fraud.

<DATELINE>LEWISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Word of a monthlong English course with no
grades, no required papers, no interruptions and no tuition was
sheer poetry for 10 promising writers who usually have more than
verse and meter on their minds.
   Poets often can't find time to write because they must find ways
to put food on the table, said John Wheatcroft, director of
Bucknell University's Seminar for Younger Poets.
   So Bucknell invites the 10 best young writers it can find, puts
them up for a month each summer and lets them work.
   The writers completed their four-week course Friday night with a
meal they cooked at a farm along the Susquehanna River and a poetry
reading in Bucknell's 105-year-old poetry center.
   ``I'm very grateful for this. I've never had a time in my life
devoted exclusively to poetry,'' said Lisa Sornberger, who recently
returned to school at Eastern Connecticut State University in
Willimantic, Conn. Before her return, she was recreation director
at a home for retarded adults.
   ``There's never enough time, so I squeeze writing in when I
can,'' she said. ``I write mostly in the car while I'm driving.
I've tried to keep a tape recorder, but it picks up too much road
noise.''
   To keep the poets off the streets, Bucknell began inviting them
to its campus six years ago.
   Usually, 50 to nearly 100 apply for the program, submitting two
letters of recommendation, a letter of self-introduction and 15
pages of poetry. Only 10 writers are selected.
   ``We're not trying to teach a body of information. We're not
even trying to teach a skill,'' Wheatcroft said. ``We're giving
them an opportunity to develop themselves as poets. We provide them
with the environment and ambience for that.''
   An anonymous evaluation from a participant in one of the first
five programs likened the seminar to a religious retreat ``in that
everything felt sacred ... except that the religion was poetry.''
   Sornberger wrote seven new pieces this year, but none is a
completed poem, she said. Amy Hickman of Anderson, S.C., who goes
to Goucher College in Baltimore, finished three and revised several
she had done before arriving at Bucknell.
   For her reading Friday night, Hickman prepared ``Charlie and
Ruby June's Champale Party,'' in which the heroes party in the back
of a pickup truck, knocking back rum and Slurpees.
   Sornberger read ``Aunt Stella,'' ``a composite of a lot of women
I love.''
   Even with an unpromising financial future from poetry, Hickman
and Sornberger said they couldn't quit writing it without losing
part of themselves.
   ``For instance, when I'm not writing much, I get very tense,
very on edge,'' Hickman said. ``Writing poetry is like making order
of the world. It's sort of being like people who are obsessively
neat.''
   Jobs and other classwork are the main culprits stealing time
from would-be poets, Wheatcroft said.
   ``Usually, princes subsidized poets and in some countries the
state subsidizes them. In this country, most poets have had some
other job,'' Wheatcroft said. T.S. Eliot was in banking and William
Carlos Williams was a pediatrician, for example.
   ``In undergraduate work, usually students must divide themselves
over four courses, split their heads four different ways,'' he
said. ``We wanted to provide them with a month to see what they
could do.''

<TEXT>
   The acquittal of Imelda Marcos dealt
a setback to embattled President Corazon Aquino, but looming
political battles and talks on the future of U.S. bases promise
rougher days ahead.
   Problems have beset her administration from all sides.
   During the past six weeks, Communist rebels have killed two U.S.
serviceman and kidnapped a Peace Corps volunteer.
   Foreign business groups complain that poor infrastructure and
government policies are driving away international investors.
Annual inflation is running in double digits, and the stock market
is sluggish.
   Mrs. Aquino's formation of a new political movement has angered
her supporters in Congress.
   Now, the acquittal of Mrs. Marcos on federal racketeering
charges by a New York jury Monday has invigorated the dwindling
ranks of supporters of her late husband, ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Surveys show Filipinos are losing faith not only in Mrs. Aquino.
Confidence is also dropping in all institutions she proudly cited
as evidence she restored democracy after a 1986 uprising toppled
Marcos' authoritarian regime.
   Despite the problems, Amando Doronila, editor of The Manila
Chronicle, said he was impressed by Mrs. Aquino's ``steely'' calm
during an interview this week.
   Many Filipinos are convinced that recent events have eroded Mrs.
Aquino's support in both this country's Congress and the United
States.
   Congressional supporters are angry over Mrs. Aquino's decision
to organize a new political movement, Kabisig or ``arm-in-arm,'' to
promote social programs.
   Critics see the movement as a bid by the Cabinet to bypass the
legislature in the distribution of patronage. On Thursday, House
Speaker Ramon Mitra, an Aquino stalwart, said the country did not
need ``another poorly conceived program'' and blamed the
government's failures on ``incompetent Cabinet secretaries.''
   Rightly or wrongly, many Filipinos believe the U.S. connection
has been frayed.
   Filipino nationalists rail constantly at ``American
intervention.'' But Washington's blessing _ real or perceived _ is
seen as a strong political card, and government opponents take
heart when they believe that support is waning.
   Many Filipinos are convinced that U.S. backing is ebbing, even
though U.S. jets helped put down a December coup that nearly
toppled the government.
   That view is based on several events that U.S. officials insist
are coincidental.
   They include an offer by the U.S. military to fly dependents
home after Communist rebels killed two airmen near Clark Air Base
on May 13. There were few takers, but Manila newspapers made banner
headlines of the American ``evacuation.''
   Last month, the United States withdrew all 261 Peace Corps
members because of fears Communist rebels planned to kill or kidnap
volunteers.
   Although one volunteer, Timothy Swanson, was reportedly
kidnapped, commentators and government officials say Washington
overreacted.
   Presidential spokesman Tomas Gomez said Washington has an
``obligation'' to help correct the unfair image of instability it
had created.
   In addition, the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines
recently complained of 57 ``anti-foreign investor'' bills pending
in Congress. It said the government appeared hostile to investment.
   Mrs. Marcos' acquittal was seen as another sign that Washington
was no longer interested in accommodating Mrs. Aquino.
   Ambassador Nicholas Platt has repeatedly stated support for Mrs.
Aquino. However, Filipinos remember Washington gave similar
assurances to Marcos before dumping him for Mrs. Aquino.
   ``All in barely a week, we saw how the Americans failed the
popular expectations of the Aquino government,'' wrote columnist
Art Borjal in The Philippine Star, a pro-administration daily.
``The general feeling is that the Americans are tightening the
screws on the Aquino administration.''
   Such views will doubtless complicate talks on the future of the
six U.S. military bases by encouraging the Philippines to take a
hard-line stand on compensation and other issues.
   Talks resume next month. The lease on the bases expires in
September 1991.
   Any new agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Senate. As a sign of its mood, the Senate has agreed to
consider a resolution barring U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage
because of ``anti-Filipino'' remarks during earlier talks.

<TEXT>
   Negotiations will resume next week on final
details of an agreement expanding U.S. access to military
facilities in Singapore, the Pentagon says.
   The proposed deal would not give the United States its own
military base in Singapore, but it would greatly expand U.S.
military activity in the Southeast Asian city-state, Lt. Cmdr.
Edward H. Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman said Friday.
   Lundquist said no U.S. planes or ships would be based there
permanently, but a small contingent of American military personnel
_ probably fewer than 200 _ would be stationed at the Singapore
facilities to keep them ready for U.S. use.
   Lundquist stressed that the proposed use of Singapore military
facilities would not be a substitute for the larger U.S. forces at
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines. A
military bases agreement between the United States and the
Philippines expires next year, and the administration is seeking to
negotiate some form of continued use of those facilities.
   If the Singapore deal is concluded, U.S. F-16 fighter planes
based elsewhere in Asia would be allowed to conduct occasional
training missions in Singapore, and Navy ships could use
Singapore's strategically located port, Lundquist said.

<HEAD>Administration Proposes Voluntary Seafood Inspection Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is planning to enhance
current seafood inspections with a voluntary program paid for by
companies whose products could earn an official government seal.
   The new program would use industry controls and government
inspections ``to provide additional assurances to consumers that
fish and fish products are safe, wholesome and properly labeled,''
officials said Friday.
   The program was proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The FDA has a seafood inspection program that requires
examinations of processors, shippers, packers and repackers,
labelers, warehouses and importers of fish and fish products. That
program would continue separately.
   NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service runs a voluntary,
fee-for-service seafood inspection program, which uses a government
inspection mark. That program would continue to provide grading
services, but continuation of other parts of the program would
depend on the extent to which companies switch to the new system,
officials said.
   The new plan would be based on inspections at various critical
points at which health risks, such as spoilage and bacterial
growth, can be controlled, the FDA said. Companies would pay a fee

<HEAD>Complaints Against Airlines At Record Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer complaints to the government about
airlines hit a five-year low in May, the Transportation Department
says.
   The department received 689 complaints for the month compared to
826 in April and 805 in May 1989, the department said. It said the
peak of 7,280 came in August 1987 and the trend since then has been
downward.
   Federal officials believe the trend reflects improved
performance by the airlines, department spokesman Hal Paris said
Friday.
   Reports of mishandled baggage, however, were up slightly. The
May average was 5.92 complaints for every 1,000 bags handled
compared to 5.85 for April.
   The most common complaints concerned cancelled or delayed
flights. May statistics showed 80.8 percent of all flights operated
within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, compared to 82.2 percent
in April. Delays caused by mechanical problems were not included.
   Southwest Airlines had the lowest complaint rate among major
carriers for May, with 0.47 per 100,000 passengers. TWA had the
highest with 4.62.
   America West was first in on-time arrivals, with 91.8 percent,
followed by Alaska, Eastern, Pan Am, Southwest, Northwest, USAir,
Delta, American, United, Continental and TWA.
   The department took over the job of counting complaints in 1985
from the now defunct Civil Aeronautics Board. The only complaints
counted are those telephoned or mailed directly to the department
in Washington.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is hoping the
industrial powers will open their pocketbooks to Moscow, but there
were indications a quick aid fix may not be in the cards.
   The issue of Western aid to bolster Soviet reforms will be
discussed at the meeting of seven industrial nations beginning
Monday in Houston.
   It was also a topic at a two-day meeting of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in London, but no decisions were made on the
matter.
   President Bush said at the close of the NATO meeting that he had
``big problems'' with a German-French Soviet aid plan that could
total billions of dollars.
   Bush cited concerns including the American people's objections
to Soviet assistance to Cuba.
   NATO sources said Gorbachev, in a letter to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher appealing for aid, said he hoped for
``positive conclusions'' at the London and Houston summits.
   The letter did not mention any particular aid figure, the
sources said.
   Gorbachev has already had some success in attracting Western
help.
   West Germany has granted an unconditional loan of $3.1 billion,
and European leaders agreed at a Dublin summit in late June to
grant significant sums to the Soviet Union.
   ``We view this step as an illustration of the desire to support
reform policies started by President Mikhail Gorbachev,'' West
German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said last week.
   Some have suggested that West Germany's motives are not entirely
altruistic, however.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said in a recent commentary
that Bonn was trying to ``grease'' Moscow into agreeing to allow a
united Germany to belong to NATO, something the Western allies want.
   ``This act by the West German government must be explained above
all by efforts of the West German government to buy from the USSR
the desired position on the issue of unification of the two
Germanys,'' said Kommersant, a Soviet economic weekly of the
cooperative movement that seeks to foster independent businesses.
   Whatever the motives of the donors, there is little doubt that
the Soviet Union could use some Western cash.
   Moscow's balance-of-payment deficit now tops $2 billion, with
nearly half that sum owed to West German companies and creditors.
Soviet citizens are also unhappy about the short supply of consumer
goods.
   Economists both at Gosplan, the central agency responsible for
running the economy, and at the reformist Institute for World
Socialist Economies have concluded outside aid is essential for the
transition to a market economy.
   But that transition carries the price of hardship on the
population. That means more discontent, which puts even more
pressure on Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has said the country must develop some kind of market
economy.
   But many delegates to the Communist Party congress under way in
Moscow oppose private property and individual ownership of
factories _ two basic precepts of a free-market economy.
   In addition, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has balked at
freeing prices _ another key step toward a market economy.
   Soviet officials have not said exactly what they would do with
any Western money.
   ``For now the question of how the Soviet Union is going to
utilize the means it has received is open,'' Kommersant said.
   Then there's the problem of how much money it would really take
to stabilize the Soviet economy.
   Estimates range from $5 billion to $20 billion _ huge sums
compared to what Eastern European countries have gotten from the
West to restructure their economies.

   All was not idyllic at Cafe
Paradiso when a chef started throwing plates because he was
apparently upset over the quality of mussels for a main dish, a
newspaper reported today.
   The display at the restaurant began with the shattering of a
single dish and built up into a frenzy of plate-throwing _ some
with meals, some without, the Evening Post reported.
   Distressed kitchen staff ducked the barrage Friday night while
patrons craned for a prime viewing position, the paper said.
   Relative calm returned after 10 minutes when the chef walked out
the back door.
   One staff member said the outburst was prompted by ``troubles
with the mussel mains.''

<TEXT>
   To F. Scott Fitzgerald, they were
``breathlessly aristocratic'' clubs frequented by ``an impressive
melange of brilliant adventurers and well-dressed philanderers.''
   To Sally Frank, Princeton University's men-only eating clubs are
part of an old-boy network that discriminates against women.
   Fitzgerald venerated the Tiger Inn and the Ivy and Cottage clubs
in the 1920 novel ``This Side of Paradise.'' Almost 60 years later,
Ms. Frank sued the three organizations, seeking membership in the
Ivy League school's men-only clubs.
   After an 11-year battle during which she was vilified by other
students, Ms. Frank, a 1980 Princeton graduate, prevailed last week
when the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the clubs to open their
doors to the opposite sex.
   Ms. Frank, now a 31-year-old law professor at the New York
University Law School, said she fought for so long because she
believed the battle had implications beyond the Gothic-style
ivy-shrouded campus.
   ``You always have clubs that call themselves private across the
nation where major business and political leaders are members and
people take tax deductions for their members,'' Ms. Frank said.
   ``We know that important business contacts are made in those
places and public policy decisions are often made over the dinner
table,'' she said. ``The case is part of the broader struggle to
stop discrimination in those kinds of organizations.''
   The century-old eating clubs, which are near campus, serve meals
to more than 75 percent of Princeton's juniors and seniors. They do
not provide living quarters. The clubs have competitive standards
for admission, and students pay membership fees.
   The cachet of the clubs made a deep impression on Princeton
alumnus Fitzgerald, who described the Ivy Club as ``detached and
breathlessly aristocratic.'' In his romantic vision, the University
Cottage Club attracted ``brilliant adventurers and well-dressed
philanderers,'' while the Tiger Inn preferred the
``broad-shouldered and athletic'' type.
   Such distinctions did not sit well with Ms. Frank, who was
raised in Bayonne and said her sense of social justice grew out of
the Chicago Eight trial and the Kent State shootings. At 12, she
boycotted non-union lettuce, and at age 13 she worked for
presidential candidate George McGovern.
   She said she had no inkling that her attempt to join men-only
clubs in an institution that first accepted women in 1969 would
spark such a ruckus.
   ``I thought that they would be intelligent about it and that
they would see it as an issue and argue or debate it,'' Ms. Frank
said. ``I expected some hot repartee.''
   Instead, a club member poured beer on her, she was booed at
alumni rallies, and her face was painted with a mustache on
``Frankbuster'' T-shirts that said ``Better Dead Than Co-Ed.''
   Things have changed at Princeton since the lawsuit was filed in
1979.
   The Cottage Club settled in 1986 and now accepts women. The Ivy
Club and the Tiger Inn, the only two of the 13 eating clubs to
cling to male-only membership, had voted earlier this year to admit
women, but two more rounds of voting were needed next year for the
decision to become effective.
   In court, the Tiger Inn and Ivy Club had argued they were
private associations and therefore exempt from state
anti-discrimination laws. But the Supreme Court said it was
``disingenuous'' for the clubs to pretend they could exist apart
from the school. The clubs, the court said, are places of public
accommodation.
   The Tiger Inn president has promised to take the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Princeton's clubs are the first at an Ivy League school to be
ordered to admit women. The Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination ruled in March that it had no jurisdiction to decide
the case of a woman seeking admission to the Fly Club, one of
Harvard's nine all-male social clubs. Yale's most exclusive secret
society, Skull &amp; Bones, of which George Bush is a member, recently
voted to continue excluding women.
   In a gauge of how far Princeton has come, the Alumni Council
last month gave Ms. Frank an award for her efforts in encouraging
coeducation.
   ``It felt really warm and nice,'' she said. ``What the award
meant to me was that just because you are a dissenter, it doesn't
mean you are not loyal.''

<HEAD>Greek Government Loses Court Bid To Stop Marbles Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Greek government has lost a last-minute court
bid to block a sale by Sotheby's auctioneers of a collection of
ancient Greek marble statues and pottery.
   The Greek government had sought to prevent the Cycladic Marbles,
as the collection is known, from being split up.
   ``We are very disappointed,'' Victoria Solomonidis, cultural
attache at the Greek Embassy in London, said after Friday's ruling
by the High Court in London.
   The judge, Sir John Mummery, said if the Greek government wants
to keep the collection intact it can bid for the marbles and
pottery itself at the auction in London on Monday.
   ``If the government's real interest is to prevent dispersal of
the collection, then it is within its power to do so by attending
the auction ... and bidding for and purchasing the items,'' he said.
   Sotheby's sale catalog lists 180 auction lots of marble statues,
pottery, drinking vessels, vases and other items.
   Ms. Solomonidis declined to comment on the judge's suggestion
that the Greek government buy the collection.
   The Greeks say the collection, which dates between 2600 B.C. and
2200 B.C., was looted from the uninhabited Greek island of Keros in
the late 1950s or the 1960s. British news reports called the
collection as rare and valuable, but no sum was mentioned in the
court proceedings.
   Lawyers for the Greek government on Thursday obtained a High
Court injunction temporarily banning Sotheby's from moving any of
the collection.
   But Mummery ruled Friday against continuing the injunction, a
move that would have forced Sotheby's to cancel the sale.
   The judge noted that the Greek government had waited until the
last possible moment to press its claim, rather than seeking to
establish ownership during the years since the sculptures were
allegedly stolen.
   The present owner is the 77-year-old widow of Professor Hans
Erlenmeyer of Switzerland. She was approached by the Greek
government when the collection was first listed for auction on her
behalf, but she refused to withdraw it.
   The sale is being held to raise cash for the Erlenmeyer
Foundation, which was established in 1981 in Basel in Switzerland.
It works for causes ranging from environmental protection and
conservation of natural resources to safeguarding animal rights.
   It was not the first time the Greeks have contested ownership of
ancient treasures. Britain has repeatedly refused Greek government
demands for the return of the priceless sculptures known as the
Elgin Marbles, which adorned the Acropolis in Athens 2,500 years
ago.
   A British diplomat, Lord Elgin, removed them in the early 1800s.
   The British government says the Elgin Marbles belong to the
British Museum in London, which bought them from Lord Elgin in 1816.
   Britain maintains that Elgin acquired the sculptures legally at
a time when Greece was ruled by Ottoman Turkey. Greece says he
stole them.

   Officials at the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant suspended handling of all nuclear materials because
of lax security, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Friday.
   Plutonium operations at the plant were halted in November while
safety and management improvements were made at the plant. The new
ban applies to other Rocky Flats nuclear operations, virtually all
of which are classified.
   The suspension went into effect Thursday night following an
annual inspection by members of the DOE's Albuquerque, N.M.,
operations office, according to Rocky Flats DOE manager Robert M.
Nelson.
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver is the nation's only
source of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   Nelson said investigators discovered security at the plant could
be breached. Investigators were sent in during the past few weeks
to try to smuggle out pieces of metal such as plutonium and other
security-sensitive materials, he said.
   Nelson said the only line of defense that failed was a metal
detector such as that used at airports, and there were other lines
of defense that caught the materials.
   ``It wasn't like they could smuggle it off the plant site,'' he
said.
   Nelson said the deficiencies developed because workers were
wearing steel-toed shoes required by federal regulations that kept
setting off the metal detectors. He said workers at the plant
became frustrated at having to remove their shoes to pass through
the detectors, and security became lax.
   He said there was no danger because of the security lapses, and
the problems have been corrected. He said workers are now wearing
fiberglass-toed shoes that don't trip the monitors.
   ``Maybe we overreacted when we shut down the plant,'' he said.
``They only made it through one line of defense. But to me, that's
enough to stop everything.''
   Nelson said other violations were found, but none were
``showstoppers.''
   They included things like improper access to classified
documents and improper handling of chemicals, but he wouldn't be
more specific.

   Another earthquake hit quake-shattered
Gilan province in northwestern Iran on Friday night, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, on Saturday quoted Tehran
University's Geophysics Center as saying the quake registered 5.9
on the Richter scale. There were no immediate reports of casualties
or damage.
   IRNA said the quake hit the city of Rudbar at 11:05 p.m. local
time (3:35 p.m. EDT) Friday. It also was felt in Tehran, 185 miles
to the southeast, and in Rasht, capital of the Gilan province which
is only 30 miles north of Rudbar.
   On June 21 an earthquake registering between 7.3 and 7.7 on the
Richter scale killed at least 40,000 people and injured about
60,000 by Iranian estimates. About half a million were left
homeless.
   The region has been hit by numerous aftershocks.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can
cause considerable damage and one registering 6 can cause severe
damage.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori has returned
home largely empty-handed from a weeklong trip to the United States
and Japan, but he has reaffirmed his plans to shake up Peru's
reeling economy.
   Fujimori, speaking at an airport news conference after arriving
Friday, said he will raise taxes, free up foreign exchange rules
and privatize many state companies. The measures will help attract
foreign lenders, he said.
   ``Peru with only its own resources will not be able to escape
its crisis,'' said Fujimori, who succeeds President Alan Garcia on
July 28.
   Inflation in Peru tops 2,000 percent per year. Four of five
people lack steady work. The government is bankrupt and has been
selling gold bars to import food.
   Fujimori appeared tired after the flight from Tokyo. He was met
by about 100 supporters waving banners and playing music.
   In Japan, Fujimori met with government officials and Emperor
Akihito. In New York he met with the leaders of the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank.
   The only aid Fujimori was promised on his trip was $4.6 million
in agricultural credit from the Japanese government. Other aid will
be contingent upon introduction of an approved adjustment plan,
Fujimori said.
   Fujimori, winner of a June 10 presidential runoff, has been
sharply criticized by Peru's strong left-wing parties for reversing
a campaign pledge not to apply an economic ``shock'' program.
   At the airport, the president-elect said the ``adjustments will
not affect the majority of the population.''

<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 3rd graf to ADD that Snyder told

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-war priest Phillip Berrigan, who inspired
fellow prisoner Mitch Snyder to a life of social activism, will be
among prominent speakers at the homeless advocate's funeral at a
shelter in the shadow of the Capitol.
   Arrangements for the outdoor service Tuesday were being
completed Friday as officials determined Snyder, 46, apparently
hanged himself this week in despair over problems in his 15-year
relationship with fellow homeless advocate Carol Fennelly.
   Others scheduled to speak include two-time Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry, comedian-activist Dick Gregory and actor Martin
Sheen, who portrayed Snyder in a television movie.
   Six weeks before his suicide, Snyder told members of his
Community for Creative Non-Violence that the Internal Revenue
Service was investigating Snyder in connection with royalties he
received for the movie that starred Sheen, The New York Times
reported today.
   CCNV spokeswoman Shannon Whight told the newspaper that all the
money went into the community, which calls itself non-profit but as
a political protest, has not asked the government for tax-exempt
status. Ms. Whight said she was uncertain about any other details
regarding any IRS probe of Snyder.
   Snyder had credited Berrigan and his brother, Daniel Berrigan,
also a Roman Catholic priest, with helping him change his life
after his imprisonment for auto theft 20 years ago.
   Snyder met the Berrigans at the federal prison in Danbury,
Conn., where the brothers were serving time for burning draft cards
to protest the Vietnam War.
   Snyder adopted their methods of social activism and non-violent
protest, first joining the anti-war movement and then picking up
the cause of homelessness after he moved to the nation's capital in
1973.
   Snyder's body was discovered Thursday hanging from an electrical
cord in his room at the 1,400-bed shelter he created in a former
government building a few blocks from the Capitol. He had won the
building from the Reagan administration in 1984, using a hunger
strike and national publicity as his weapons.
   Dr. Georges Benjamin, the city's public health commissioner,
ruled Friday that Snyder's death was the result of ``asphyxiation
by hanging'' and said there was no evidence of foul play.
   Police called it ``an apparent suicide'' and said a note
containing ``suicidal references'' was found near Snyder's body
outlining problems in his personal relationship with Fennelly, his
partner in running the Community for Creative Non-Violence.
   Fennelly declined to discuss the situation saying, ``This just
isn't the time.''
   Snyder was remembered by Jackson at a church memorial service on
Friday as ``a man of justice'' who worked tirelessly to assist the
downtrodden.
   Jackson told about 600 mourners that Snyder was a man who heard
and answered a ``moral call'' to help the homeless.
   ``The fact that birds have a home, foxes have a home, and yet
men and women, veterans of foreign wars, mothers and fathers,
working poor people, have no place to lay their head _ he found
that to be a moral disgrace,'' Jackson said.

<HEAD>Students Celebrate After President Resigns, General Strike Appears
Averted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking students chanted ``Victory!
Victory!'' and the premier appealed for calm after Socialist
President Petar Mladenov bowed to popular pressure and resigned.
   Mladenov's announcement Friday night appeared to avert a general
strike the students had planned for Monday against the government
led by ex-Communists.
   The students and the political opposition had demanded
Mladenov's resignation after a videotape revealed he suggested
tanks be used to stop anti-government demonstrators in December.
   Mladenov's letter of resignation was read on television news
Friday night, meeting a deadline set by the students in an
ultimatum earlier in the day.
   Mladenov, who was instrumental in ousting Bulgaria's longtime
strongman Todor Zhivkov, said he was resigning because he did not
want ``to become the cause for an escalation of tensions in the
country,'' BTA reported.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov appealed for order in the wake of the
resignation so that Parliament could hold its first session Tuesday
in a calm atmosphere.
   The students had conducted a 26-day sit-in to push their demands
for democratic change after the former Communists won last month's
parliamentary elections, the first free balloting in Bulgaria in 58
years.
   They called for a general strike Monday if Mladenov had not
resigned by then.
   Atanas Kirchev, a student leader, said the students would
probably declare an end to their strike, BTA reported. It said
students celebrated the resignation with victory chants.
   Students, teachers and parents from across the country had
joined in the student strike in Sofia, and the growing split in
public opinion led to fears of violence similar to that which has
rocked neighboring Romania in recent months.
   Mladenov, in a nationwide television address on Wednesday,
implicitly admitted having called for the use of tanks during the
December demonstrations. Earlier, he had said a videotape in which
he was heard to say ``Let the tanks come'' was doctored. But
experts said it was authentic.
   The videotape was broadcast on TV on an election program by the
main opposition alliance, the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces,
three days before the June 17 parliamentary runoff elections.
   The film was made Dec. 14, when about 50,000 angry demonstrators
converged on Parliament to demand that the Communist Party give up
its monopoly on power. The protesters later dispersed peacefully
and tanks were not called in.
   Mladenov came to prominence in November when he and other
reform-minded party members ousted hard-liner Zhivkov after 34
years.
   Mladenov, who had served as foreign minister for 18 years,
replaced Zhivkov as Communist Party leader and president. He
immediately began taking cautious steps toward reform and opened a
dialogue with opposition groups that quickly organized.
   In April, the Communists changed their name to the Socialist
Party and won 211 of the 400 seats in parliament in the June
elections. The Union of Democratic Forces won 144 seats.
   Mladenov was to have served until the parliament drew up a new
democratic constitution, in about 18 months.
   Most of the original demands of the students, on strike since
June 11, have been fulfilled, including the resignation of the TV
director and publication of alleged election irregularities.
   But according to BTA, the students drew up a new list of demands
Friday. They have demanded that a date be set for a public trial of
Zhivkov, 78, who is in detention. He has been charged with
misappropriation of state property, inciting ethnic hostility and
grave abuse of power.
   They also demand the removal of parliamentary deputies
associated with the former Communist regime's decisions, such as
setting up harsh prison camps and agreeing to take part in the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Nuclear Operations Halted at Rocky Flats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Security lapses _ including a metal
detector that had been adjusted by workers tired of their steel-toe
boots setting it off _ prompted a suspension of all nuclear
operations at the Rocky Flats plant, officials say.
   Plutonium operations at the government plant were halted in
November while safety and management improvements were made. The
new ban applies to other Rocky Flats nuclear operations, virtually
all of which are classified.
   The suspension went into effect Thursday night following an
annual inspection by members of the Department of Energy's
Albuquerque, N.M., operations office, said Rocky Flats DOE manager
Robert M. Nelson.
   Nelson ordered the suspension to allow for correction of the
shortcomings. The duration of the shutdown was not immediately
known.
   The plant, run by EG&amp;G Inc. for the department, is the nation's
only maker of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   Nelson said investigators discovered that security there could
be breached, and investigators were sent in during the past few
weeks to try to smuggle out items in their clothing such as
plutonium and other sensitive materials.
   Nelson said the only line of defense that failed was a metal
detector such as that used at airports, and there were other lines
of defense that caught it.
   Security was lax because workers were wearing steel-toe shoes
required by federal regulations that kept setting off the metal
detectors, Nelson said. He said workers became frustrated at having
to remove their shoes to pass through.
   He said said workers are now wearing fiberglass-toe shoes.
   ``Plutonium processing operations are shut down right now, so
this was a good time to do it,'' he said. ``Maybe we overreacted
when we shut down the plant. They only made it through one line of
defense. But to me, that's enough to stop everything.''
   Nelson said other violations were found, but none were
``showstoppers.'' They included such things as improper access to
classified documents and improper handling of chemicals, he said.
He would not elaborate.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins ordered the halt to plutonium
operations late last year to let EG&amp;G address safety and
environmental concerns.

<HEAD>Unity Talks Enter Final Stage; Economic Pinch Prompts Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts from both East and West Germany have
held their first full talks on the final stage of creating a single
nation, and some sticking points emerged.
   Also Friday, East Germany was hit by factory workers' warning
strikes and farmers' threats to dump their milk because the shift
from communism to capitalism is hurting them.
   Guenther Krause, East Germany's top negotiator and the
Parliament state secretary, said Friday the two sides agreed on a
timetable of meetings that will result in a final unity treaty by
the end of August.
   Krause also said the exact date of all-German elections _
expected in December _ would be decided by the end of this month.
   The two nations are negotiating a treaty that will reconcile the
differing laws of the countries and build a political framework for
a united Germany.
   One point of disagreement is the new nation's capital.
   Krause said the treaty should mandate that Berlin is the capital
of a united Germany. But West German Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble told reporters the decision on the capital should be made
by a newly elected Parliament of both nations.
   Bonn is now the West German capital and East Berlin is the East
German capital.
   The political treaty would have to be ratified by both
Parliaments. East Germany would then hold elections in October to
create five state governments, to match the West German state
government system.
   Under one proposal, common German elections would be held in
December and the two countries would formally merge a day later.
   The political treaty would be the companion piece of the
economic pact that went into effect on Sunday and formally combined
the economies of the two German states.
   The economic merger triggered soaring prices in East Germany,
where lawmakers on Friday passed a law to break up state grocery
chains that suddenly had become unregulated monopolies.
   Lawmaker Gerhard Schultz said the new rule should help stop the
``exorbitant prices and price dictating.''
   The law allows local governments to sell the stores of the huge
grocery chains HO and Konsum in their towns to private buyers.
Under the former Communist system, all prices in state stores were
set by the government.
   On Friday 120,000 factory workers were striking for job
protection and higher wages to compensate for rising prices, and
farmers buffeted by Western competition threatened to spill unsold
milk in the streets.
   Farmers in southern Leipzig said Friday they would dump 2,640
gallons of milk on the streets Monday to protest the loss of
business, the East German news agency ADN said.
   East German workers have been staging daily ``warning strikes''
to demand higher wages and protection against widespread
joblessness expected as East German enterprises confront Western
competition.
   The East German affiliate of the powerful West German
metalworkers union, IG Metall, called more strikes Friday at
factories in East Berlin, Frankfurt an der Oder, Cottbus, Potsdam,
Hennigsdorf and Eberswalde.
   More than 120,000 workers took part in one-hour rallies, said
Detlef Kuchenbecker, spokesman for the West German union.
   The strikes were held to coincide with negotiations between the
metal union and 151 Berlin-area factories represented by a newly
formed East German employers association.
   IG Metall is seeking labor contracts similar to those it has in
West Germany.

   Some of the homeless had lived under the
trees across from City Hall for more than two years. But within
hours, the transients' occupation of Civic Center Plaza seemed like
it had never taken place.
   Office workers ate lunch under the olive trees in the one-block
park and children played tag on the grass; mothers wheeled their
babies on the paths and old men sat on benches, reading newspapers
and chatting.
   Police rousted some 100 transients from their illegal camp
before dawn Friday, the deadline set by Mayor Art Agnos. Five
people were arrested for refusing to leave, and another half dozen
arrests took place later in the day.
   The liberal mayor, who had been under pressure to restore the
showpiece park to public use, was enforcing a city ordinance
banning camping in public places.
   After city workers had moved the transients' tents, sleeping
bags and assorted possessions to homeless shelters, and hauled away
trash, the plaza had an uncharacteristically pristine appearance by
midday.
   Dozens of people who previously steered clear of the park
reclaimed the lawns and benches.
   ``I just sat on the bench ... enjoying the sunshine,'' City Hall
employee Tony Pacheco said. ``Normally I wouldn't do that. It
looked like a campground until today.''
   ``There was a whole bunch of people before, and we were
afraid,'' said Karen Valdez, 9, who played with her sister and two
brothers. ``We didn't come a lot to the park because there were
drunk people around here.''
   Police said they planned round-the-clock patrols of the park,
which was virtually deserted Friday night, to discourage the
homeless from returning.
   One homeless men who had camped at the park for months pledged
to return, even if it meant being arrested.
   ``I'll just lay here and let them take me, because I'm right.
I'm talking about the United States. I've got rights,'' said Kenny
Martin, 40.
   Martin said he had nowhere else to go. He characterized the
city's shelters, including two that opened this week, as
``warehousing'' and claimed they had no vacancies.
   But Larry Bush, an assistant to the mayor, said ``no one has
been turned away.'' On Thursday night, the two new shelters, with a
total of 140 beds, had about 20 vacancies, he said.
   Scores of homeless people have lived in the plaza for several
years, and their numbers swelled to more than 300 after the Oct. 17
earthquake, which destroyed or made uninhabitable many residential
hotels.
   Police officers used a ``low-key, friendly approach'' in telling
the campers to leave, said Police Chief Frank Jordan.
   ``We're going to take it a day at a time, but long term we think
it is a step in the right direction,'' he said.
   Five homeless people went to court Friday, asking a judge to
stop the arrests.
   They claimed the ordinance violates the rights of the homeless
and that the arrests are cruel and unusual punishment because the
homeless have nowhere else to go.
   Superior Court Judge John Dearman refused to block the arrests
but set a July 23 hearing.

<TEXT>
   Auto crashes, homicides, suicides and swimming
accidents account for three-quarters of the deaths of more than
22,000 young people in this country each year, the national Centers
for Disease Control says.
   Nearly 13 percent of the 22,411 fatal injuries to children in
1986 were homicides, second only to motor vehicle accidents, the
agency said Friday. It said 1986 is the latest year for which
complete statistics are available.
   Auto accidents accounted for 10,535 deaths in people under 20 in
1986, and between 15 percent and 30 percent of those deaths were
associated with alcohol, researchers said.
   The agency said 2,877 people under age 20 died from homicide in
1986, and 660 of them, or 23 percent, were under 5.
   Suicide was the third leading cause of childhood fatal injuries,
accounting for 2,151 deaths in 1986. Males accounted for 80
percent, and the suicide rate was roughly twice as high for whites
as for blacks.
   Drowning, the fourth leading cause of childhood fatal injuries,
killed 2,062 youths; it was the most common fatal injury among kids
under 5 and among young men 15-19.
   Death rates for children from causes other than injuries dropped
by 56 percent between 1968 and 1986. Deaths from injuries fell 22
percent in the same period, the agency said.
   In 1986, a total of 71,383 people under 20 died in this country.
   Dr. Juan Rodriguez, a CDC injury research specialist, said that
if the deaths of infants are not included, injuries account for 64
percent of deaths in the under-20 age group.
   Most homicides, he said, ``were among the older adolescents, the
15-to-19-year-olds. But a lot were the young children; that is
quite worrisome.''
   Sixty-eight percent of the young homicides occurred among males,
and rates for black children were about five times higher than for
white children.
   A companion CDC report noted that fire officials in Arizona's
Maricopa County recorded 243 calls for drownings and near drownings
involving kids under 5 in 1988-89. About half of those incidents
probably could have been prevented with pool fences and adequate
gates and latches, the CDC said.
   Arizona, the agency said, has a high risk of child drownings
because of the large number of swimming pools there. Maricopa
County alone, which includes the Phoenix area, has an estimated
125,000 public and private pools.
   Another type of injury, fire and burns, killed 1,619 young
people in the U.S. in 1986; 53 percent of those deaths occurred
among kids under 5, and 73 percent occurred among kids under 10.
   For many deadly childhood injuries, preventive measures exist or
are being developed, the agency said. Among the measures cited are
car air bags, pedestrian barriers and enclosing swimming pools with
fences.

<HEAD>Japan Blasts Whaling Commission for Refusing to Lift Whaling Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>

   Angry about an International
Whaling Commission decision to continue a ban on commercial
whaling, Japan is threatening to quit the 37-nation regulatory body.
   Japan blasted the commission Friday for overwhelmingly rejecting
a proposal a day earlier to lift the ban on certain types of
commercial whaling. It said the commission caved in to pressure
from environmental groups.
   Japan says the minke whale, the smallest commercially viable
whale, is no longer in danger of extinction. Supported by Norway
and Iceland, it called for exempting the minke whale from the ban.
   But the commission, by more than a two-thirds majority, upheld a
1986 moratorium on all commercial whale hunting.
   ``A group of nations voted as a like-minded bloc and (for their
advice) relied on a minority of scientists that are mostly
affiliated with anti-whaling organizations,'' said Alan Macnow,
spokesman for the Japanese delegation.
   ``The Japanese are going to give it another year at least to see
if the group will accept'' its proposals for limited commercial
whaling of the minke whale, Macnow warned.
   ``If not, the delegation will recommend to their government that
they form another (whaling) organization,'' he said.
   Macnow said the Japanese held talks with delegates from Norway
and Iceland to determine the character of a possible new body.
   Gudmunder Eiriksson, the leader of Iceland's delegation, also
accused the commission of allowing politics to pervade in its
decisions.
   The ban on whaling will continue for one more year, until the
commission's next meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Iceland.
   Compliance with the ban is voluntary among members of the
commission, which has no enforcement powers.
   The International Whaling Commission was set up in 1946 by
international treaty. The organization, which includes all the
world's major whaling nations, works to save whales from extinction.
   The whaling mortatorium was instituted in 1986, after nearly all
the major whale species had been hunted to near-extinction.
   The commission voted Friday to begin surveying the world's
dolphin and porpoise populations. Those fishes have increasingly
become the prey of whale fishermen deprived of their customary
catch by the four-year ban.
   In the early 1960s, when Japanese whaling was at its peak,
whales provided about 23 percent of all meat consumed in the
country. Since then, declining whale supplies have turned it into a
delicacy.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of firefighters today spent
another night defending the village of Tok from a 50,000-acre
wildfire at its edge. Statewide, more than 180 fires have blackened
an estimated 400 square miles.
   Fire was burning Friday night to within a half-mile of Tok, a
community of about 900 people along the Alaska Highway, 260 miles
northeast of Anchorage.
   But most residents planned to leave a shelter and sleep in their
own homes overnight. Firefighters had widened the firebreaks
protecting the village, and the winds pushing the flames through
the spruce forests and tundra had dropped.
   ``Mother Nature dealt us a good hand. It's overcast and the
temperatures are cooler, so we didn't get active burning, really,''
said Rob McWhorter, a Bureau of Land Management spokesman. On
Thursday, the fire burned to within a quarter mile of the village
because of gusty winds.
   Despite the apparent stall in the fire, McWhorter said it was
too soon to declare the danger over.
   ``Today's weather is supposed to be the same kind of high
temperature, relative low humidity, and possible gusting winds that
was the situation when the fire blew up Thursday,'' he said.
``We're not out of the woods yet.''
   Traffic was a stop-and-go affair for a second day on the Alaska
Highway, a primary route for travelers heading north to Fairbanks
or south to Anchorage.
   Authorities closed the highway nine miles outside of town for
about a half-hour in early afternoon because of fire and heavy
smoke. Traffic then was restricted to one way only. Cars had to be
led through the haze by a pilot car.
   At least 396 square miles were burned across a wide mid-section
of the nation's largest state, but equipment, crews and attention
have been focused on the Tok fire, the only one posing a
significant threat to people and property.
   Statewide, an estimated 1,200 firefighters were deployed as 37
new fires Friday brought to 184 the number burning out of control
across Alaska's interior, said Pat Flowers, a fire spokesman.
   Most of the fires were blamed on near-record heat, low humidity
and lightning, which struck an estimated 2,300 times in a one-day
period ending Friday night.
   No injuries or fatalities have been blamed on the fires, which
began last weekend.

<HEAD>First Running of Bulls in Pamplona Gores One, Hurts 58</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One Spaniard was seriously gored today
and 58 others slightly injured in the first running of the bulls at
the weeklong San Fermin festival made famous by U.S. author Ernest
Hemingway.
   The six bulls ran the half-mile stretch from the pens to the
bull ring in a very long eight minutes.
   During the run two bulls left the pack, stopped in the
cobblestoned streets and threatened dozens of youths testing their
bravery by running before them. The bulls finally headed into the
city bull ring.
   Navarre Hospital said a 24-year-old Spaniard who fell before a
bull suffered a deep gore wound to the neck and was in very serious
condition.
   Another Spaniard suffered a broken nose in a fall and 57 other
runners received on-site treatment for bruises and scrapes.
   The festival attracts an estimated 200,000 tourists from around
the world to this northern city, doubling its normal population.
   The bull runs take place every morning and are followed up each
afternoon with professional bullfights.
   The bull running, part of the non-stop drinking and dancing
festival in honor of San Fermin, the city's patron saint began
Friday and is to continue through July 14.
   Except during war years, the festival has been held continously
since 1591. Since that date bulls have gored to death 52 people, 13
of them since 1924, when Hemingway first visited Pamplona.
   The writer's 1926 novel, ``The Sun Also Rises,'' described in
detail the rowdy, round-the-clock festival that awakens with the
morning run of the bulls.

<HEAD>Expatriates Demand More Attention from U.S. Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans living abroad say the U.S. government
isn't doing enough to help them solve problems involving taxes,
voting, education and citizenship.
   The U.S. expatriates concluded their first world conference
Friday by urging the government not to ignore them just because
they don't live in the United States.
   John F. Crawford, the meeting's co-chairman, said the two-day
gathering could eventually lead to an expatriates' ``bill of
rights.''
   He argued that creating better conditions for the estimated 3
million U.S. citizens abroad could help American competitiveness in
world markets.
   The 200 expatriates, who came from as far away as Brazil and
Nigeria for the Paris gathering, said the United States lags behind
other nations in helping its citizens overseas.
   For example, the United States is the only industrial nation
that taxes citizen overseas on income earned abroad. It allows
expatriates no representation in Congress _ unlike France, for one,
whose overseas citizens have six Senate representatives.
   Overseas Americans can have problems ensuring citizenship for
their children. And their schools _ unlike those for Japanese,
Germans and French living abroad _ receive no government help.
   The expatriates are also denied Medicare and Medicaid, even
though they make Social Security payments.
   The group said its goals included congressional representation,
a congressional task force to deal with their problems and a
high-level panel made up of representatives of various government
agencies to handle expatriate concerns.
   Other ideas discussed at the conference included teacher
exchange programs, bringing inner-city American children to foreign
American schools to widen their horizons, and getting more overseas
Americans to participate in U.S. elections.
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, R-Calif., said he already was taking
steps to set up a congressional task force. Dymally, who was one of
10 members of Congress at the Paris meeting, presided over hearings
last November on overseas Americans. He said more hearings were
planned this fall.
   Ben Blaz, who represents the Pacific territory of Guam in
Congress, said overseas Americans would have to work to win the
attention of Washington or their needs would continue to be ignored.
   ``The burden is on you to change that attitude,'' he said.
   The meeting was sponsored by the Association of Americans
Resident Overseas, the European Council of American Chambers of
Commerce, American Citizens Abroad, Democrats Abroad, Federation of
American Women's Clubs Overseas, and Republicans Abroad.
   Crawford said the mainly Europe-based groups that organized the
meeting would try to bring together other Americans-abroad groups
in the Middle East, Latin American and Asia.
   The coalition will try to convene a second conference in
Washington in the spring of 1991, he said.

   Federal investigators were sent to
examine the wreckage of a chemical plant today to find the cause of
a thunderous explosion that killed 17 workers and sent dozens of
employees scrambling for safety.
   Two tanks that collected waste water and flammable hydrocarbons
exploded at the Arco Chemical Co. plant about 15 miles east of
Houston late Thursday. The blast could be heard 20 miles away.
   ``When I heard it, I knew what had happened,'' said employee
Kathryn Cox. ``I hollered to my people, `Y'all run, run as fast as
you can!' I looked back twice and then I just kept running because
I knew if it went again, we'd probably get blown up.''
   The explosion leveled an area the size of a city block. Five
people, including two people living near the complex, suffered
minor injuries.
   Investigators with the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration were to inspect the charred, twisted metal today in
hopes of finding the cause.
   The roof of a three-story, 900,000-gallon tank blew off and
landed 100 yards away in a parking lot. The rest of the tower was
scattered over a block-wide area. Several smaller explosions
followed. A smaller, connecting tank was blackened.
   ``It looks like a tornado or fire went through that area,'' said
Assistant U.S. Labor Secretary Gerard F. Scannell, who is leading
an investigation of the accident.
   OSHA investigators are looking into a number of aspects at Arco,
including the maintenance record and complaints from family members
that some employees were having to work long hours, Scannell said.
   Plant manager Earl McCaleb said the tanks were in operation, but
he added that it was believed that ``some kind of work'' was being
done on a compressor, which compresses gases before they enter the
tanks.
   Seventeen bodies were pulled from the debris. One victim, an
employee of a waste hauling company, was found in the cab of his
truck, officials said.
   Five other victims were Arco Chemical employees, and 11 were
employed by a contractor, Austin Industrial Inc. of Houston.
   More than 50 people were working in the plant at the time,
officials said. The plant has more than 350 employees.
   ``We were running through the mud just as fast as we could get
out of there,'' said Tommy McBridge, a plant worker. ``We knew what
it was.''
   The fire was out by daybreak Friday. Plant firefighters sprayed
down the wreckage while other workers searched for bodies amid the
twisted pipes and other debris.
   The plant had one previous safety citation, received in 1988 for
a death at an off-site fire training facility, McCaleb said.
   The plant produces propylene oxide, used to make flexible foam
for seat cushions and bedding. The substance also is used for
cleaning compounds.
   In addition, the plant makes styrene monomer, used for
insulation, foam drinking cups, packaging materials and auto parts,
and methyl tertiary butyl ether, a high-octane blending component
used instead of lead in gasoline.
   Arco Chemical, based outside Philadelphia, has been running the
plant since 1980, three years after it went into operation.
   It was the second major loss of life at a Houston-area

   Hundreds of supporters of former
First Lady Imelda Marcos drove around the capital today, held
demonstrations and offered masses and prayers to celebrate her
acquittal of racketeering charges in New York.
   About 130 cars and mini-buses filled with Marcos loyalists drove
through Manila's major roads flashing ``victory'' signs and
shouting ``Marcos still!'' to show their happiness over Monday's
verdict clearing Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos with Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi were cleared of
federal racketeering and fraud charges. She had been accused of
helping loot the Philippine treasury of $222 million and spending
the money to buy art and real estate, much of it in New York.
   Many of the vehicles carried placards praising the American jury
that cleared the 61-year-old Mrs. Marcos. Other placards were
saying the acquittal showed that Mrs. Marcos was innocent.
   The caravan momentarily stopped by a hospital and the seaside
cultural center where Mrs. Marcos built several exhibition and
convention halls during the 20-year rule of the her late husband
ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Marcos and his family fled the Philippines in February 1986
after a civilian-backed military rebellion toppled his government
and installed Mrs. Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   The former Philippine strongman died in exile in Hawaii last
September before the racketeering charges in which his wife was
acquitted went on trial.
   Mrs. Marcos, however, also faces court proceedings in
Switzerland in which the Philippine government seeks to recover
hundreds of millions of dollars the Marcoses allegedly robbed from
the treasury.
   Later today, the motorcade broke into two groups and held
separate rallies. About 3,000 loyalists attended a rally and mass
at the seaside Luneta Park near the U.S. Embassy. Some 500 others
demonstrated infront of the central post office building, a few
miles away.
   ``We have reason to rejoice,'' said Rally de Guzman, a leader of
one of several loyalist groups at the Luneta. ``The verdict favored
the First Lady because she was innocent. The charges were filed by
her political enemies and you know how dirty politics can be.''
   De Guzman said they were still awaiting word from Mrs. Marcos on
whether her lawyers in Manila would file a new petition before the
Supreme Court asking the tribunal to allow her to return following
her acquittal.
   The high court had earlier agreed to a government ban on the
return of Mrs. Aquino, saying she remains a threat to national
security.
   ``Mrs. Aquino is afraid of Imelda Marcos because she knows that
she is not the legitimate president,'' de Guzman added. ``even
though Marcos is dead, the loyalist know that the First lady can
take over.''
   During the rally, copies of a letter allegedly from Mrs. Marcos
and her family were distributed. The letter thanked the loyalists
for their moral support while the trial was ongoing.
   ``My acquittal is God's answer to all our prayers,'' the letter
said. ``Even as we thank the lord for my vindication, let us join
together in fervent prayers that this be the beginning of genuine
reconciliation....''
   A mass was held at the rally and officials said many more masses
would be held later today in several churches in Manila.

<HEAD>Soldier to Face Court-Martial From Death During Panama Invasion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 19-year soldier has been ordered
court-martialed on charges of murdering a Panamanian during the
U.S. invasion.
   In ordering the trial, Fort Bragg commander Lt. Gen. Gary Luck
on Friday reduced the charge against Master Sgt. Roberto Enrique
Bryan from premeditated murder to unpremeditated murder.
   Bryan, 42, is charged in the Dec. 23 shooting of an unidentified
Panamanian.
   The Army Times, an independent publication, reported that Bryan
is accused of shooting a prisoner taken after a firefight near an
electrical generating station.
   Fort Bragg spokesman Maj. Doug Foster refused to comment on the
incident.
   If convicted, Bryan could receive life in prison and
dishonorable discharge. No date was set for the court martial.
   ``Our argument will be that the killing was a lawful but
unfortunate killing,'' said Bryan's lawyer, Mark Waple.
   At least three other U.S. soldiers have been prosecuted for
their actions during the invasion that drove Gen. Manuel Noriega
from power.
   Two soldiers were charged with the unpremeditated murder of a
civilian during a firefight investigators said was staged to cover
up a soldier's loss of his military handgun. One soldier was
convicted and one acquitted.
   Another soldier pleaded guilty to obstruction, conspiray and
other charges in the slaying.

   The Louisiana Senate has passed a bill
that would require the music industry to put warning labels on
recordings with themes of rape, murder, suicide, drugs, child abuse
and satanic worship.
   The measure passed 28-9 Friday. It goes back to the House for
approval of amendments.
   ``We pass bills all the time to have clean air, clean water,''
said Sen. Oswald Decuir. ``Why can't we do something to clean up
the environment for children?''
   The measure originally made retailers responsible for labeling
records, tapes and compact discs. But it was amended to put the
onus on the recording industry.
   A manufacturer could be fined up to $3,000 for each item sold to
a minor without the label. A retailer who fails to heed the label
and sells such a recording to a minor could get up to six months in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Opponents questioned the measure's constitutionality and warned
that the local economy could lose millions of dollars.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has said it
will no longer consider New Orleans as a site for the Grammy Hall
of Fame if the bill becomes law. The National Association of Record
Merchandisers has threatened to cancel a 1992 convention in New
Orleans.
   In May, the record industry unveiled a voluntary labeling system
that it hoped would halt campaigns in some states for mandatory
labeling. It became effective this month.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said at the time that 16 of the 21 state legislatures
considering such bills had backed down since the industry announced
its plans.
   Earlier this week, Capitol Records promised to provide legal
help to store operators threatened with arrest for selling its
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit
lyrics.
   Last month, two members of the rap group 2 Live Crew were
arrested in Florida for performing songs from their sexually
explicit ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album at an adults-only
show. A federal judge has declared the album obscene in South
Florida.

   A defense lawyer suggested that the jogger who
was beaten nearly to death in Central Park might not have been
raped.
   The question came up during cross-examination Friday of Dr.
Robert Kurtz, the surgeon who supervised the the woman's treatment
at Metropolitan Hospital.
   Under questioning by Robert Burns, a lawyer for one of three
teen-agers charged with rape and attempted murder in the 1989
attack, Kurtz testified that there was no evidence of injury in the
woman's genital or rectal area.
   He added that lack of such evidence is not unusual in rape cases.
   The defense attorney did not ask Kurtz directly whether he was
certain the jogger had been raped. Outside the courtroom he said,
``What we are really saying is that the examination of the genital
area did not show any injury.''
   Burns went on to say that if the jogger ``was fighting
vigorously, as a woman who is resisting would,'' there should have
been some evidence of injury.
   But Kurtz said, ``You don't fight with your genitals. You fight
with your arms and legs and fists.''
   The jogger, a 29-year-old investment banker, was jumped by a
gang of youths in the park and apparently left for dead. She
recovered and is back at work.
   On trial are Yusef Salaam, 16, Antron McCray, 15, and Raymond
Santana, 16.

<HEAD>`Dartman' Hits 52nd Victim; Bullets Could Be Next, Psychologist
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dartman, the mystery figure who gets his kicks
blowing darts at the backs and buttocks of well-dressed women,
could turn more violent if he remains on the loose, a psychologist
says.
   ``Next stage would be bullets instead of darts,'' Harvey
Schlossberg, former head of the Police Department's psychological
services unit, was quoted as saying in today's Daily News.
   ``He has got to increase the amount of pain and reaction by the
victim to give himself pleasure.''
   On Friday, hours after Police Commissioner Lee Brown appealed
for help from the public, the attacker hit his 52nd victim since
June 26. All the attacks have taken place in daylight in midtown
Manhattan, the most crowded part of town.
   Dubbed Dartman by the city's tabloids, the attacker has
repeatedly blown two-inch homemade darts at his victims. Not all of
the darts have met their mark, some becoming entangled in clothing,
and no one has been seriously hurt.
   Judith Blitman, a psychiatrist and professor of clinical
psychology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, suspects the
attacker will curtail his activities as police close in.
   ``He feels attacked himself,'' she told the Daily News. ``He'll
be quite scared by all the publicity.''
   In Friday's attack, a passerby saw an attack on a woman in a
blue business suit. Police said the passerby warned the woman, who
pulled the homemade dart out of her clothing and kept walking.
   The witness called a police hotline and reported the attack. He
said the man who appeared to have fired the dart fled.
   Earlier, Brown asked people who work in midtown to call police
if they spotted a man resembling the one in a police sketch.
   ``There's enough to worry about walking through the city without
this,'' said Liz Echauss, 22, who was dressed in a smart blue linen
suit for a job interview.

<TEXT>
   A social worker who allowed a foster child
to return to his parents' home, where he was killed for soiling his
pants, plans to appeal after being placed on three years'
probation, her lawyer says.
   Margaret Barber, 62, who could have been sentenced to up to five
years in prison, was the first employee of the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services ever criminally convicted over the
handling of a case.
   Ms. Barber, the main foster-care worker for 2-year-old Bradley
McGee of Lakeland, was found guilty of negligence June 15 in
recommending to a judge that the foster child be returned to his
parents, while not providing the court with a psychological report
describing the parents as explosive and infantile.
   Bradley died two months later of head injuries after repeatedly
being shoved head first into a toilet for soiling his pants,
authorities said.
   Thomas Coe, 23, and Sheryl Coe, 21, each were charged with
first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in the child's
death. Mrs. Coe pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and is
serving 30 years in prison while her husband faces trial next week
in Fort Myers.
   ``I believe I did everything with the best of intentions and
there were no malicious acts,'' Ms. Barber said before sentencing
Friday.
   But Circuit Judge J. Tim Strickland said negligence, not evil
intent, was the issue.
   Ms. Barber's lawyer, John Liguori, said he planned to appeal the
conviction on grounds that crucial evidence was disallowed and that
the jury didn't take its job seriously, even reportedly throwing a
party during deliberations.
   ``To some extent Margaret Barber was the scapegoat for whatever
failings were in the system,'' Liguori said.
   ``I will carry on,'' Ms. Barber told about 100 fellow HRS
workers who cheered her as she left court. So far, her colleagues
have raised more than $1,000 for her appeal.
   Public outrage over Bradley's death led legislators to change
the law to make child safety a top priority instead of family
reunification.
   Three other HRS workers were cleared of misdemeanor charges in
the case.

   A powerful aftershock jolted
quake-shattered northwestern Iran overnight, panicking residents,
setting off landslides and injuring two people, official media
reported today.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency also reported a tremor
near the southern Iranian city of Yazd this morning, but it was
considerably less powerful than the aftershock in the north.
   IRNA and Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the aftershock
struck the city of Rudbar in Gilan province, at 11:05 p.m. Friday
(3:35 a.m. EDT today). Tehran University's Geophysics Center said
it registered 5.9 on the Richter scale.
   More than 400 aftershocks have hit Gilan since the devastating
June 21 earthquake, which killed about 40,000 people, injured
60,000 and left about half a million people homeless. The initial
quake was measured at between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   The aftershock Friday was felt in Tehran, but caused no
casualties or damage in the Iranian capital, IRNA said.
   The quake near Yazd, 370 miles from Tehran, measured 4.9 on the
Richter scale, the center said.
   The agency and the radio initially reported Rudbar had been hit
by a new earthquake, but in later dispatches IRNA called it an
aftershock.
   IRNA said two people in Rudbar were taken to hospitals for
treatment. The earthquake-flattened city has only makeshift relief
clinics, however.
   The news agency said the aftershock triggered landslides in the
mountainous region that blocked two main roads, but it said crews
immediately moved in and worked until the roads were cleared.
   Gilan and Zanjan, another agricultural province to its south,
bore the brunt of the June 21 quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can
cause considerable damage and one registering 6 can cause severe
damage.
   Iranian Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri said this week that it
would be overwhelmingly difficult to rebuild the
earthquake-stricken region.
   The interior minister said Iran needed to repair roads, water
systems and electrical service, as well as replace buildings. The
cost just to repair residences and the water and electrical systems
will be $1 billion, he said.
   He said 90,000 residences had been damaged in the quake. Most of
them were made of mud brick or kiln-dried brick with little
reinforcement in the walls.
   He said Iran had two months to build shelter before the rainy
season begins in September.

   The governor of the troubled northern
state of Kashmir ordered an indefinite curfew in the capital
effective today and gave the army full control of the battle
against Moslem separatists.
   Soldiers in camouflage uniforms manned checkpoints and patrolled
in machine-gun mounted jeeps, strictly enforcing the curfew, said
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Hindu-dominated government announced a Special Powers
Ordinance giving the army command of countering the Moslem
insurgency, newspapers reported. In the past, the army was
subordinate to the police and paramilitary forces.
   Residents said they feared the move could be the start of a
fresh crackdown and more violence in the state, which borders
Moslem Pakistan.
   Jammu-Kashmir Gov. Girish Saxena signed the order Friday,
permitting army troops to conduct searches and destroy militant
hideouts and ordering an indefinite curfew in Srinagar, the
newspapers said.
   On Thursday Saxena empowered security forces to fire at any
suspected insurgent and search and destroy any building.
   Srinagar has been the focal point of the Moslem movement for
secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-majority India.
   At least 668 people have been killed in the picturesque
Himalayan valley since Jan. 20, when the government first ordered a
crackdown on Moslem insurgents.
   However, the insurrection has shown no signs of abating.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's 25 states which
has a Moslem majority. A separatist movement has been simmering in
the Kashmir valley since 1947, after its Hindu ruler opted for
union with India when the subcontinent was divided into
Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan.
   The insurgency flared this year after Moslem insurgents dropped
their demand for union with Pakistan and began agitating for
independence and the status of an neutral nation.
   The government responded by dismissing the state government and
bringing the province under the federally-appointed governor.
   On Friday, Interior Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed said the
state would be brought under direct federal rule from July 19, when
six months of governor's rule expires.
   The decision is a technicality, since Gov. Saxena will remain
the federal government's representative in the state. But it
indicates that the government has no immediate plans to hold
elections to the state assembly.
   Under state law, governor's rule cannot be extended beyond six
months, but federal or president's rule can remain in force for up
to three years.

Mid-Atlantic states, parts of the Appalachias and the Plains. Rain
also fell in the Rockies, across Washington state and the desert
Southwest.

   South Korea may join North Korea in
opening a strip of border for the first time in four decades, an
influential newspaper said today.
   North Korea said Friday it would open a portion of its frontier
at the truce village of Panmunjom on Aug. 15 in order to promote
Korean unity, and called on South Korea to do the same.
   South Korea initially dismissed the move as propaganda. But the
Dong-A Ilbo newspaper, quoting an unidentified government official,
said today that Seoul was reconsidering.
   Also today, Kim Dae-jung, South Korea's best-known opposition
politician, expressed support for the North Korean move and asked
the Seoul government to broaden contact with North Korea at all
levels.
   Kim, addressing a rally, also urged the Seoul government to
accept a North Korean proposal to share a single seat in the United
Nations with rotating representation.
   In another development today, South Korean officials said North
Korea agreed to reopen talks aimed at setting up a joint meeting of
lawmakers from the capitalist South and the Communist north. The
talks, suspended since January, were to resume July 19.
   Longtime observers expressed hopes that this week's developments
could lead to an easing of tensions between the Koreas. The
peninsula has been divided since 1945.
   North-South negotiators agreed in principle this week to meet
July 26 to sign accords for a historic first meeting of prime
ministers of the two nations. The talks are expected to be held in
Seoul in August.
   North Korea said Friday it would open an 800-yard stretch of
border at Panmunjom, a truce village inside the 2.5-mile-wide
demilitarized zone, on Aug. 15. Korea was liberated from Japan on
that date in 1945.
   Panmunjom is an oval-shaped enclave straddling a western portion
of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. It is where military
officials of both sides meet to discuss alleged armistice
violations. The area is off-limits to civilians.
   North Korea said it would not allow outsiders to travel into the
north beyond the perimeter of Panmunjom.
   The initial South Korean response was negative, but Dong-A said
some within the government were rethinking their stance.
   ``Although the North Korean move is believed to be propaganda,
we would not reject it totally. We would rather use it to help ease
tension and bring them to openness,'' the paper quoted the
unidentified official as saying.
   The paper said the South Korean government may reciprocate by
opening its own sector of Panmunjom, and suggest that the border
village be made a meeting place for 10 million separated family
members in the two Koreas.
   South Korea also may propose building a ``peace city'' jointly
with North Korea inside the demilitarized zone, it said.
   North Korea has rejected similar proposals in the past.
   Seoul officials said they suspect that the North Korean move is
aimed at encouraging South Korean dissidents to hold a unification
rally at Panmunjom on Aug. 15.
   A major South Korean dissident group, Chonminyon, welcomed the
North Korean announcement and said it will send 300 delegates to
meet with North Koreans that day.
   The Seoul government bans unauthorized contact with North Korea
by its citizens. It contends dialogue with the North Koreans must
be conducted through official channels.

   Iran's official news agency reported
today that one of the 16 Western hostages held in Lebanon _ most
likely a European _ will probably be freed soon.
   Most Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by factions
of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group
that gets considerable financial support from Iran.
   ``A Western hostage held in Lebanon will probably be released
soon,'' said the Islamic Republic News Agency's five-sentence
dispatch from Beirut, Lebanon, citing ``informed sources.''
   It said the sources refused to disclose the identity of the
hostage to be released, but ``hinted that he is most probably a
European national.''
   The English-language IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said
``it is not known when and where the hostage will be released.''
   The hostages include six Americans and 10 Europeans _ four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   In Beirut, a source close to the Syrian army command said if a
hostage were to be released, it would ``probably'' be Brian Keenan,
the Irishman who also holds a British passport. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity and refused to provide any other information.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It has 40,000 troops
in northern and eastern provinces as well as the Moslem sector of
the capital.
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut April 11, 1986,
as he walked from his home to the American University of Beirut,
where he taught English.
   No group has claimed the abduction of Keenan, of Belfast. But
American educator Frank Reed said after his release in April that
he had seen Keenan.
   Two underground factions in Lebanon, the Organization of Islamic
Dawn and the Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade, had
claimed to hold Reed.
   Iran played a key role in mediating the release of Reed and
another American hostage in Lebanon, Robert Polhill.
   The first word of a possible release of hostages in April had
come from IRNA in short, similarly worded dispatches. Within days,
Polhill was freed and Reed's release followed.
   Iran said then it would work for the release of other hostages
if the United States and Western governments make a ``gesture of
goodwill.''
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and other Iranian officials
suggested that Western governments pressure Israel to release about
300 inmates, most of them Lebanese Shiites, held at a detention
camp in south Lebanon.
   The inmates are suspected guerrillas involved in an underground
warfare against Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army who control a border strip in south Lebanon.
   Israel has said it would not agree to any such deal unless it
also involved freeing three Israeli servicemen believed held by
Shiite groups after disappearing in south Lebanon.
   An outpouring of Western assistance to Iran after the
devastating June 21 earthquake had raised hopes in some quarters
that Iran might use its influence with the pro-Iranian groups
believed holding the hostages.
   Rafsanjani has said Iran should be grateful for the foreign
quake aid. However, in comments earlier this month, he made no link
between such aid and the release of any Western hostages.
   Rafsanjani, seeking closer ties with the West, has been in
conflict with hard-line Moslem fundamentalists in the government
who oppose his efforts.
   Iran also has demanded that the Western governments help shed
light on the fate of four Iranians who were kidnapped in 1982 by a
right-wing Lebanese Christian militia in north Lebanon.
   Christian leader Samir Geagea has said that when he seized
command of the Lebanese Forces militia in 1985, he found no trace
of the Iranians, and blamed their murder on his rival predecessor
Elie Hobeika.
   But Iranian officials have in recent weeks insisted that they
have word that the missing Iranians are still alive.
   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East bureau chief for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon.
He was abducted March 16, 1985.

   A Christian Science couple convicted of
manslaughter for relying on prayer to heal their dying son said
they would abide by a judge's order to take their other children to
a doctor for regular check-ups.
   The requirement was part of the 10 years' probation handed out
Friday to David and Ginger Twitchell.
   ``We always tried to obey the law, both in '86 and now, and
we'll try to obey the judge's instructions,'' Twitchell said.
   The couple were convicted Wednesday of recklessly and wantonly
causing the death in 1986 of their 2{-year-old son, Robyn, by not
seeking medical care for the boy, who had a bowel obstruction. They
could have received 20 years in prison.
   Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin imposed probation under
maximum supervision and ordered the couple to take their three
remaining children for checkups under guidelines set by the
American Medical Association.
   Hamlin also said that at ``any signs of serious illness'' in the
children _ who range in age from 9 months to 8 years _ a doctor
must be called in.
   In a statement, Twitchell said that while he would obey the
order, he would ``always pray first'' for his children's health.
   ``We have never ruled out medical care. We just feel prayer,
God's power, is a lot better,'' said Twitchell.
   The former Boston residents, both 34, now live in Brentwood, N.Y.
   The Christian Science Church teaches that sickness can be healed
by spiritual means alone. Church officials have said the case is an
attack on their religion and expressed confidence the verdict will
be overturned on appeal.
   The trial has garnered wide attention, in part because it was
held in Boston, where the Christian Science Church has its
headquarters.
   Since 1980, there have been seven prosecutions of Christian
Science parents on such charges as murder, manslaughter and
neglect. Five have been convicted, one acquitted, and one case was
thrown out, child rights activist Rita Swan.
   No one was jailed in those cases.
   Prosecutor John Kiernan had asked for a long period of probation
for the Twitchells, periodic checkups of their children and a
requirement for community service.
   Defense attorney Steve Lyons had asked that the Twitchells
receive four years' probation with no conditions. He said required
checkups would place a ``medical policeman'' in the Twitchell home
when ``there are no guarantees with medicine.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany welcomed results of the
NATO alliance meeting, especially a decision that the size of a
united German military should be negotiated at ongoing arms talks
in Vienna.
   But East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and his
foreign minister criticized the alliance for not renouncing the
first use of nuclear weapons in Europe, where the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact alliance is unraveling.
   De Maiziere, in an interview Friday night with West Germany's
ZDF television network, said the results of the London summit,
which ended Friday, ``in many points remained behind our
expectations.''
   He said the process of German unification would be considerably
easier if NATO would abandon its policy of ``flexible response''
and renounce the first use of nuclear weapons.
   Flexible response leaves open the possibility that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization could counter a conventional attack
with nuclear weapons.
   The strategy was developed as a deterrent against the Warsaw
Pact's superior numbers of troops and tanks, but the Soviet-led
alliance is losing strength and relevance after last year's
democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   The NATO leaders, in concluding their two-day summit, said the
alliance would from now on regard its own nuclear arms as weapons
of ``last resort.''
   But at the insistence of Britain, they said ``there are no
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military
action might be discounted.''
   The leaders also proposed the elimination of nuclear artillery
shells from Europe. But NATO will still have 700 short-range Lance
missiles in Europe.
   East Germany's foreign minister, Markus Meckel, said the danger
of a nuclear war in Europe remained as long as NATO has an arms mix
of conventional and atomic weapons, according to the East German
news agency ADN.
   ``We believe that Europe doesn't need atomic weapons for its
security. This is why we reject for Germany the stationing ...
ownership and transport of such mass means of destruction,'' ADN
quoted Meckel as saying.
   Meckel's West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was
considerably more upbeat, calling the London gathering ``a historic
summit for Europe.''
   ``The German delegation was very satisfied with the outcome of
the summit,'' a government source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Another source said ``it was our very clear intention'' to have
the size of a united Germany military negotiated at the
conventional arms talks in Vienna.
   The Soviet Union had wanted the question of German troop levels,
one of the contentious points in discussions over approaching
German unification, negotiated in the ``two-plus-four'' talks among
the four World War II victors and the Germanys.
   West Germany rejected that idea, not wanting its forces to be
singled out among Europe.
   Negotiating the size of Germany's military in the
``two-plus-four'' talks would have amounted to the victorious World
War II allies setting German troop limits.
   But negotiating it in the context of the conventional armed
forces in Europe talks puts the question in the broader context of
European security.
   Genscher, in an interview from London with West Germany's RIAS
radio, said the summit had sent a ``clear and significant political
signal'' to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that there would be
cooperation on disarmament.
   And he said Germany could lead the way in that cooperation by
giving the Soviets assurances on what would be the future strength
of a united German military.
   West Germany's full-time military troop level is 465,000, with
30,000 active-duty reservists who can be called into action
immediately.
   East Germany's military strength, debilitated by defections
following the collapse of the Communist government, is 97,000, East
Germany's defense ministry said this week.
   Defense ministry sources in Bonn said this week the government
was willing to consider limiting post-unification troop strengths
to about 400,000.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said at the last
round of ``two-plus-four'' talks in Berlin the Soviets would like
to see a united German army of between 200,000 and 250,000 troops.

<TEXT>
   A terrorist suspected of
belonging to the Red Army who gave herself up to West German police
has agreed to speak out on the group's structure and recent
attacks, according to news reports today.
   But the woman, Susanne Albrecht, has refused to detail alleged
ties between terrorists and East Germany's ousted Communist
leadership, Der Spiegel magazine reported.
   Albrecht, 39, was arrested in East Germany but voluntarily
surrendered to West German police last week. She was one of eight
alleged Red Army members who lived in East Germany under false
identities supposedly supplied by the now-disbanded East German
secret police.
   West Germany had a warrant out for her arrest for her alleged
role in the July 30, 1977, shooting death of West German banker
Juergen Ponto.
   Der Spiegel's article is to appear in its Monday issue, but an
advance text was provided by the magazine today. Der Spiegel did
not say how it had obtained information on her testimony to police.
   The magazine quoted West Germany's chief prosecutor, Alexander
von Stahl, as saying he did not expect the seven other Red Army
suspects held in East Germany to be extradited.
   Instead, von Stahl said the seven would probably stand trial
under West German law after the two Germanys formally unite.
   ``There's hardly time to begin criminal (extradition)
proceedings before unification,'' von Stahl said. A formal merger
of the two German states is expected in December.
   However, Von Stahl did call on the seven suspects still in East
German custody to surrender to West German authorities.
   No group in East Germany has taken responsibility for hiding the
Red Army suspects, although West German media have accused ousted
Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and the head of the Stasi,
Erich Mielke, of doing so.
   The hard-line Communist leadership was ousted last year.

   Rebels have tightened their noose on
the capital, attacking the port near the fortified mansion of
besieged President Samuel K. Doe.
   ``Don't die for Doe,'' rebels only two miles from the executive
beachfront enclave urged demoralized government troops on Friday.
Many soldiers were abandoning their posts.
   Meanwhile, renewed talks to end the 6-month-old civil war in
this West African nation stalled Friday because a rebel delegation
had not reached the negotiating site in neighboring Freetown,
Sierra Leone.
   Doe, who seized power in a bloody coup in 1980, was holed up in
his mansion with troops of his minority Krahn tribe who have
remained loyal. His top commanders and advisers fled last week.
   The rebels led by Charles Taylor, a former Doe aide, accuse the
government of corruption and human rights abuses.
   Automatic rifle fire and artillery blasts echoed across the
capital from dawn until noon Friday, and plumes of smoke from
explosions rose from the city outskirts.
   A rebel fishing trawler fired at a coast guard cutter about five
miles offshore, and a cannon from Doe's Israeli-built mansion fired
two shells into the ocean to deter rebel boats. Witnesses said the
rebels withdrew from the port later in the day.
   The United States supplied water to the president's mansion
under heavy guard by U.S. Marines, a witness said. Four American
vehicles escorted a water tanker to the mansion early Friday
morning, the witness said.
   In Washington today, State Department press officer Anita
Stockman denied that the United States had escorted tankers or
delivered water to Doe.
   ``The situation remains the same in Monrovia. We're certainly
not providing water to Doe,'' she said.
   In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, diplomatic sources said Doe had asked
the United States to ferry him and 100 troops to his home region of
Grand Gedeh County. The United States refused the request, which
would have enabled Doe to continue the war, the sources said.
   A senior U.S. government source in Washington said Doe had
mentioned a desire to visit his home region, but did not ask for
assistance to get there.
   The United States has offered to help Doe leave Liberia, a
condition set by rebels before they will accept a cease-fire. Doe
reportedly has offered to resign on condition his safety and that
of his Krahn tribe is guaranteed.
   A senior rebel official, based in the United States, rejected a
reported plan for the six West African nations that were leading
the negotiations to send a peacekeeping force to Liberia to oversee
new elections.
   But the rebel official, Tom Woewiyu, said he would go to
Freetown for the talks.
   Soldiers continued to loot in Monrovia under cover of a
dusk-to-dawn curfew, but residents said the looting was less
widespread than during the previous night.
   Many of the city's 500,000 residents searched for food and
carried buckets of water from rapidly depleting wells.
   Monrovia has been without water for nine days and without
electricity for one week. Most shops and markets have been closed
all week, and some people have been begging for food or collecting
leaves to eat.
   The rebels began attacking the capital on Monday, but their
progress has been slow.
   Rebel sources in Ivory Coast said 4,500 more troops joined the
original assault contingent of 800 men Wednesday night, but the
insurgents failed to live up to their claim that they could take
Monrovia in 12 hours.
   The rebels invaded Dec. 24 from the Ivory Coast. Doe's forces
then killed hundreds of civilian members of the Gio and Mano
tribes, seen as the main support base for the rebels. The rebels
sought revenge by killing members of Doe's Krahn tribe and the
Mandingo people who have supported him.
   Rebel leader Taylor has gained much support throughout the
country, but the United States and other governments have
questioned his commitment to democracy and free elections.
   Reports of summary executions of suspected Doe supporters, as
well as the reported execution of one of the founding members of
Taylor's movement, also have damaged his credibility.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Forces Congress To Reconsider Vote on Each Politburo
Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today forced the
Communist Party congress to drop a plan to evaluate each member of
the party's ruling Politburo, warning the move would ``bury the
party.''
   Despite rampant criticism of his policies by the largely
hard-line congress, meeting for its sixth day, the Soviet leader
showed his mastery of the delegates by pushing through the reversal.
   ``If you want to bury the party, to split the party, then
continue on this way,'' he told delegates. ``But think hard.''
   Before its afternoon break, the congress voted 2,557-1,393 for
an individual thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote on each Politburo
member. Delegates later reversed themselves 2,495-1,515 after
hearing Gorbachev's opinion.
   Gorbachev cited a note from the delegation from northern
Arkhangelsk that said: ``There is no need to evaluate each
Politburo member. The Politburo, according to the rules, is an
organ of the leadership, and the leadership is collective.''
   Instead, the congress agreed to evaluate as a whole the work of
the policy-making Central Committee, and within it the 12-member
Politburo.
   Evaluating each Politburo member separately would have broken a
tradition of regarding the body as a collective entity. The idea
brought criticism in the corridors of the Kremlin's Palace of
Congresses from reformist delegates.
   ``Our Russian thirst for blood is showing,'' said Inna
Dementyeva, a Moscow delegate. ``It's stupid and ugly and inhuman.''
   But other party members said they backed the decision because it
would let future leaders know that they couldn't hide behind
``collective responsibility.''
   ``Collective responsibility is no responsibility,'' said a
Byelorussian delegate who identified himself only as Alexander.
``And there should be a full renewal of the leadership.''
   Delegates and reporters standing outside the Palace of
Congresses said Gorbachev looked angry when he left following the
initial vote. On previous days he stopped to talk with bystanders,
but today he went straight to his car.
   Congress members had said they expected at least half the
Politburo members would get the thumbs down.
   Names singled out as most likely to receive negative votes were
ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev _ criticized by many as
ineffective _ and Alexander Yakovlev, considered the most radical
member of the Politburo. Yakovlev has been unapologetic for his
reformist views before the largely conservative congress.
   The evaluations would have had no practical effect, because the
congress chooses a new Central Committee, which would have selected
a new Politburo anyway. But they clearly would have left a mark on
each man's career.
   The name-by-name voting also likely would have hurt Gorbachev's
position by discrediting some of his allies and helping his rival,
Yegor K. Ligachev, who enjoys wide popularity at the congress,
delegates said.
   ``Now there could even be the variant that Ligachev will come to
power,'' Anatoly Tubyshkin, a Moscow delegate had said. ``It's very
worrying.''
   The congress had been expected to begin nominating candidates
for its top post today, but by mid-afternoon it appeared
nominations would not come by the end of the day.
   Delegates said there did not appear to be any serious challenge
to Gorbachev as party leader.
   ``At present, we do not have outstanding leaders except Mikhail
Gorbachev in the party,'' said Leningrad party chief Boris Gidaspov.
   In a draft of party rules also expected to come to the floor
today, the party's head would still be called general secretary.
Both he and a deputy would be elected by the full congress of about
4,700 delegates.
   With Gorbachev the presumed winner for the post he has held
since March 1985, talk in the corridors revolved around who would
be his deputy and run the party's day-to-day affairs.
   Delegates mentioned Ligachev, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov,
Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and Pravda editor Ivan Frolov as
contenders. Gorbachev advisor Georgy Shakhnazarov said he thought
the deputy might turn out to be a near-unknown, ``someone
completely new.''
   Delegates said they expected a massive overhaul of the party
leadership. Moscow party secretary Yuri Prokofiev said today as
much as 80 percent of the leadership might be changed.
   Yakovlev and other members have already said they plan to retire
from the Politburo, and Medvedev indicated today he, too, would be
happy to retire and let ``younger, more energetic, more
strong-willed people'' take over.
   The 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, which opened
last Monday, appeared likely to adjourn sometime late next week.

   State television today showed what it
said was footage of a 1980 meeting in which Communist intelligence
agents tried to persuade the international terrorist Carlos to
leave Hungary.
   The footage appeared to back up allegations made three weeks ago
that Hungary's former Communist leaders had allowed Carlos, also
known as the jackal, to use the country as a base for his terrorist
attacks. The report did not indicate how long Carlos allegedly
stayed in Hungary.
   A former Communist official interviewed on the program claimed
that the Communists had tried to oust Carlos as soon as they
discovered he was operating in the country. The nation's Communist
Party disbanded in October.
   Carlos, a Moscow University graduate, began his life as a
terrorist in 1973 and topped Interpol's most wanted list by 1975.
In December of that year, he allegedly organized an attack in
Vienna on OPEC oil ministers in which three people were killed.
Carlos remains at large.
   State television said the meeting shown in the film took place
in 1980 in an office of the Interior Ministry's Department for the
Supervision of Foreigners and was filmed without Carlos's knowledge.
   There was no indication of how the film was obtained.
   Interior Minister Balazs Horvath said on June 27 that he had
instructed the chief prosecutor to investigate former Communist
Party officials who allegedly provided shelter and training grounds
for Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and his
terrorist group.
   The man identified as Carlos in the film spoke fluent but
accented English.
   The two Hungarian agents spoke Hungarian among themselves and
English to Carlos. The conversation was poorly recorded and
difficult to make out at times, so the film was subtitled.
   One agent told Carlos that he ``must liquidate your base of
operations here, must stop using Hungary from where to direct your
group because there is danger. Your operations may be compromised.
   ``Also, if you were to continue, the interests of the Hungarian
People's Republic may be jeopardized if you are associated with
us.''
   ``You can travel through Hungary or even stay for brief
periods,'' the Hungarian official told Carlos, trying to mollify
him.
   Andras Petresevics, one of the agents, said in an interview on
the program that the terrorist accused him of being an
``imperialist agent'' and of acting without the knowledge of his
superiors to get him to leave.
   The former Communist chief of counterintelligence, Miklos Redei,
also was interviewed in the program. Redei, who also met Carlos,
said: ``He gave the impression of being paranoid, afraid, but he
was not dumb.''
   Horvath said last month that recently discovered documents
implicated the late Communist Party leader, Janos Kadar, former
Interior Minister Andras Benkei, former President Karoly Nemeth,
and Antal Gyenes, former head of the Communist Party's foreign
relations department, in the Carlos case.
   One of the documents produced by Horvath was a letter allegedly
written to Kadar by Carlos in 1980, the same year the terrorist
apparently left Hunagry.
   ``From our base in Hungary, we have developed our international
ties, getting in contact with the revolutions of every nation
without any hindrance on the part of the Hungarian authorities,''
the letter purportedly said.
   Benkei, Nemeth and Gyenes have denied any role in sheltering
terrorists.
   Redei asserted that a small group of terrorists led by Carlos
``did not come here at the invitation of any Hungarian official. We
tried to keep tabs on them after their arrival. At one point we
lost them,'' said Redei. ``Carlos was a well-trained agent and
could spot a tail easily.''
   Redei denied Carlos was provided with any training facilities in
Hungary.
   He said fear of the terrorist kept Hungarian authorities from
acting against him. ``We ... knew that if we do anything to him,
his group would take revenge.''

   A strong earthquake jolted West Java,
destroying or damaging more than 150 homes and buildings and
killing one villager, officials said Saturday. Eleven people were
injured.
   The quake Friday measured 5.2 on the Richter scale of ground
motion and was centered in a mountainous area of Majalengka about
185 miles southeast of the capital, said Sutarjo, a government
meterology official in Jakarta.
   The death and injuries all occurred in the Anggarwati area near
the epicenter, said Majalengka district administrator Djufri
Pringadi.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 5.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 4.5.

<HEAD>Rogue Bell Ringers Peal Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of rogue bell ringers has been pealing
under false pretenses in Lincolnshire, and vicars throughout
England will be on the alert Sunday for rats in their belfries.
   Six to eight bogus ringers have recently rung unsafe bells at
four churches in the diocese of Lincoln, endangering themselves,
others and the bells, according to Church of England officials.
   The rogues struck at St. Clement's in Worlaby and St. Andrew's
in Bonby, on the south bank of the Humber, and at two other
churches that have not been identified. Similar incidents were
reported in Cambridgeshire earlier this year, and a bell tower in a
village church was damaged.
   Robin Heppenstall, secretary of the Lincoln diocese Guild of
Church Bellringers, said the pealers duped vicars and church
wardens into allowing them into the towers, where they rang bells
long silent because of their dangerous condition.
   ``It is conceivable that the clapper inside the bell could be
worn and faulty and if it flies out it could go anywhere,''
Heppenstall said.
   ``If that went out through a window it could conceivably injure
someone seriously,'' he warned.
   ``It could be churches were thinking of spending a few hundred
pounds to make the bell tower safe and the bells operational and
then suddenly they are faced with a bigger bill,'' he said.
   The bells, anchored on frames and weighing about 1,000 pounds,
revolve 360 degrees.
   ``If the frame is badly worn or eaten by woodworm and you start
ringing there is considerable force. The whole frame could collapse
under the energy of the bell,'' he said.
   Bell ringers require months of training, Heppenstall said.
   ``I've seen people lifted several feet into the air _ because
they've lost control of the bell,'' he said. ``These tower grabbers
are competent people, they appear to have some knowledge of bell
ringing.''
   Each of the 5,425 belfries in England provides a unique
experience for ringers. The size, the weight, the casting and the
way the bell is hung contribute to a distinctive toll and feel.
   ``They sound differently and you can go on a little outing and
ring in different places. But they have taken it to an extreme and
are ringing where bells are not safe and obviously we are
concerned,'' Heppenstall said.
   Anne Carpenter, assistant editor of Ringing World, a
4,500-circulation weekly newspaper, said there is a proper way to
go about testing bells.
   ``There are those who behave in a decent way and arrange proper
outings to ring bells and have lunch. That is a a perfectly
civilized way of going about it,'' Ms. Carpenter said.
   She said this was the first organized band of rogue bell ringers
she has heard of since the distinctive English style of
change-ringing developed in the 17th century.
   Such knavery has sent ominous tintinnabulations echoing through
the ringing fraternity.
   ``If a vicar has been conned he won't be keen on bell ringers on
the whole, so if anyone asks, `Can I have a ring on your bells?' he
will say, `no,''' Ms. Carpenter said.
   ``I like to visit fresh churches with my learners,'' Heppenstall
said. ``It would do them good to ring on bells that are a different
weight and I like to take them on an outing. But if I ring up a
vicar he might say we don't have visitors here because of the rogue
bell ringers, so legitimate requests are refused.''

<HEAD>Black Governor Gets Close Scrutiny in First Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After just six months as Virginia's
governor, L. Douglas Wilder is being hailed as a new national
leader and hot Democratic presidential prospect.
   But at home, the nation's first black elected governor is coming
under criticism for his travels, unpaid bills and social life.
   Since becoming governor in January, Wilder has visited 11
states, including the early presidential sweepstakes states of New
Hampshire and Iowa, carrying his message of fiscal conservatism and
social activism.
   He criticizes the failures of the Bush administration and tells
audiences the same ``new mainstream'' that elected him governor
should put a Democrat in the White House. He describes the
qualities of the ideal nominee and says ``I'd like to think I'm one
of those persons.''
   But Wilder insists he has no plans to run for president.
   The governor maintains that his travels and the attention he
gets are helping Virginia, which has not been nationally prominent
since Colonial times.
   ``It's been a long time since Virginia's ever been considered at
the national level,'' he said. ``It's to Virginia's credit that the
governor has been asked (to travel).''
   ``I give Virginia about 18 hours a day, and that's seven days a
week,'' Wilder told reporters last month.
   But the governor has come under criticism for his busy travel
schedule and, most recently, for his use of a state helicopter to
take personal trips with Patricia Kluge, estranged wife of
America's richest man, John W. Kluge.
   The Kluges, who gave Wilder his biggest campaign contribution of
$200,000, separated two months ago. The governor last winter
appointed Mrs. Kluge, a former nude model and high school dropout,
to the board of visitors of the University of Virginia.
   ``We're friends,'' Wilder told reporters last month and refused
to elaborate. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Kluge gave a similar response.
   Friends and critics of the divorced governor agree his
friendship with Mrs. Kluge is a private matter.
   ``But when the relationship somehow involves his use of state
aircraft, then to that extent it is a public matter,'' the Roanoke
Times &amp; World-News said in an editorial.
   Some blacks say Wilder has been targeted for criticism because
of his race. Even whites admit he is being watched closely because
of his unique place in American politics.
   ``By the mere fact of who he is, he's going to get some
scrutiny. That's acceptable,'' Jack Gravely, state president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said
last week.
   But he added, ``Many black folk that I've spoken to over the
holiday have said, `They've got Barry, now they're going after
Doug,''' referring to the ongoing trial of Washington's black
mayor, Marion Barry, on drug and perjury charges.
   ``An awful lot of white people are watching Doug Wilder closely.
And X percentage of them are hoping he will trip up,'' said a
white, longtime observer of Virginia politics who asked not to be
identified.
   Wilder's historic Jan. 13 swearing-in ceremony still is making
news with disclosures that his inaugural committee has yet to pay a
$148,500 bill for printing the invitations.
   The governor also has been criticized for refusing to reveal how
he will use any profits from his inaugural ball. Lobbyists and
corporations contributed an estimated $1 million to pay for the
celebration.
   Meanwhile, Virginia has been having financial troubles of its
own. Wilder has said he will announce spending cuts next month to
cope with a projected $300 million budget shortfall over the next
two years.
   ``He's worked to cut back state services, all the while
establishing himself as the most extravagant governor in Virginia's
history,'' said Joe Elton, executive director of the state
Republican Party.
   The governor also has drawn fire for ordering state agencies and
institutions to sell stocks in companies doing substantial business
in South Africa. Teachers have worried about how the divestment
would affect the state's $11 billion employee pension fund.
   The various criticisms are ``having some impact on his image
in-state,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political
analyst. ``Eventually, it will be part of the national evaluation
of Doug Wilder the candidate for vice president or president.''
   While disavowing national ambitions, Wilder has shown no
reluctance to address national and foreign policy issues. He has
asked President Bush to appoint an independent commission to
investigate the savings and loan bailout, has expressed support for
Israel and has promised to visit the Jewish state as well as Saudi
Arabia next year.
   At the same time, he has shied away from some state issues, such
as whether tax-supported Virginia Military Institute should be
opened to women.
   When the governor repeated last month that he has no opinion on
VMI's admissions policy, he was met with groans and hoots from an
audience of teen-age girls attending a conference on state
government.
   His support among other constituents, particularly blacks,
remains strong.
   ``The overwhelmingly majority of the people in the community
that I serve feel that the governor is doing a good job,'' said the
Rev. Darrel Rollins, pastor of the 31st Street Baptist Church in
Richmond.

<HEAD>U.S., Angola Blame Each Other For Famine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and Angola blame each other
for a breakdown in efforts to mount a relief operation for hundreds
of thousands of Angolans who may face starvation.
   A representative of the Angolan government said he was worried
that the Bush administration could use relief deliveries as a cover
for sending weapons to anti-communist rebels in Angola.
   U.S. officials call that allegation nonsense and say the
administration informed the Angolan government some time ago that
the U.S. was willing to permit delivery of food shipments by the
International Committee of the Red Cross or another neutral relief
organization.
   The affected area is in southern Angola and encompasses
territory under the control of both sides in Angola's 15-year old
civil war. The government has received substantial aid from the
Soviet Union over the years while the United States has been
providing covert aid to the UNITA rebels since 1986.
   The Red Cross estimates that some 250,000 Angolans are in
immediate danger of starvation because of recent droughts and the
internal conflict. The lives of hundreds of thousands of others
could be at risk in the coming weeks.
   The administration favors an overland food delivery operation
through a third country, partly because airlifts are so costly. The
countries adjacent to the affected area are Namibia and Botswana.
   Robert B. Washington, a Washington lawyer whose firm represents
the government of Angola, said in a letter this past week to
congressmen that authorities in Luanda strongly support food
deliveries to Angolans of all persuasions.
   However, he said the Angolan government has concerns about food
deliveries by aircraft or by truck from Namibia or Botswana.
   ``We hope you can understand the reluctance of the (Angolan)
government to allow officials of the administration, who have
continued to support additional funding of lethal military aid to
the UNITA rebels, to oversee the movement of supplies over unknown
boundaries into UNITA-controlled territory,'' Washington told the
congressmen in his letter.
   A State Department official, who spoke only on condition that he
not be identified, said the United States has never proposed
sending the food into Angola unilaterally.
   ``We don't know where they got that idea,'' the official said.
   Washington sent his letter to the members of Congress after
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi wrote to President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev asking them to consider a joint food
airlift for Angola.
   Savimbi also proposed that ``corridors of peace'' be created in
Angola, through which international relief convoys could pass with
guarantees of safe passage from rebel and government forces. The
Bush administration supports that approach.
   Soviet and American officials have held discussions about a
cooperative relief effort but no agreement has been reached.
   The two countries agreed recently on a joint food airlift for
Ethiopia, with U.S. food to be flown on Soviet planes.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of freedom-hungry Albanians
crowding about a dozen embassies will be allowed to leave their
hard-line Communist nation under foreign supervision, a Hungarian
diplomat said today.
   The diplomat, who spoke from the Albanian capital, Tirana, on
condition of anonymity, said the logistics of the departure had not
been worked out.
   But he said ambassadors of embassies harboring up to 5,000
Albanians had been told by Foreign Ministry officials their
personnel could supervise the issuing of travel documents and
accompany the emigres to their new homelands.
   Only people who have been accepted by another country will be
allowed to leave, the diplomat said in a telephone interview.
   The reported breakthrough came just hours after Albanian
legislators guaranteed that the asylum-seekers could leave the
hard-line Communist nation without fear of punishment.
   The rush on the embassies continued overnight, and there
reportedly were up to 5,000 people in more than a dozen missions
today.
   About 10,000 pro-democracy demonstrators gathered in a square
near the embassies Friday in the largest demonstration of its kind
in 45 years of Communist rule, Austria's APA news agency reported.
The silent rally dispersed after a brief clash between police and
some demonstrators.
   The Albanian Foreign Ministry on Thursday promised to grant
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in a
desperate attempt to flee their homeland, which borders Greece and
Yugoslavia.
   But today's parliamentary decree, published by the state news
agency ATA, was the first pledge with the force of law that all
Albanians in the foreign missions could come out and receive
passports without fear or prosecution.
   A special Central Committee meeting to deal with the recent
disorder continued into its third day today.
   Communist leader Ramiz Alia on Friday criticized the thousands
of asylum seekers and told the Central Committee that the party
would not give up power as Communists had done elsewhere in Eastern
Europe.
   ``The aims and actions of these destructive, anti-democratic and
anti-Albanian forces go too far,'' Alia said in remarks carried by
Albania's ATA news agency. ``We may be poor, undoubtedly we have
difficulties and shortages, but the foreigner has never solved our
troubles.''
   The APA report on the demonstration was sketchy, but no injuries
were reported. The news agency has one of the few correspondents in
Albania.
   Meanwhile, the embassies offering shelter to asylum seekers said
sanitary conditions were nearly intolerable.
   The number of refugees in the West Germany Embassy doubled to
2,000 overnight, and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was
consulting with his French and Italian counterparts on a resolution
to the crisis, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said today.
   ADN said there were 1,500 Albanians in the Italian Embassy and
500 in the French mission.
   Some embassies lacked sufficient food and water, and Albanian
authorities were not allowing foreign governments to send supplies,
Western officials said.
   The sometimes-violent rush to the embassies in Tirana, the
Albanian capital, this week follows last year's exodus of East
Germans to embassies in other East European countries shortly
before the fall of their hard-line government.
   Under 45 years of hard-line Communist rule, travel for average
Albanians has been virtually impossible. But under Alia, who took
over after Enver Hoxha's death in 1985, the country pf 3.2 million
people has increasingly sought ties abroad and has slowly begun to
implement reforms.
   A package of new regulations that took effect Tuesday entitled
all Albanians over age 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. The
passport regulations did not check the flow of asylum-seekers.
   Most of the Albanians who fled to foreign embassies before
Thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began Monday under
fire from Albanian security forces. Diplomats said at least three
people were wounded.
   In recent months, Alia has begun to modify Albania's Stalinist
economic and political systems. He promised on Friday to continue
reforms but insisted that only the Communist Party could ``realize
the genuine democracy, the human rights, the country's progress and
the defense of its freedom and independence.''
   Alia promised a new election law, but strongly implied it would
not affect the Communist Party's monopoly on power.

   A fire at an atomic energy research center
early Saturday caused extensive damage but no injuries, officials
said.
   The fire broke out in the biology laboratory of the Democritus
Hellenic Atomic Energy Committee in the northern Athens suburb of
Holargos, they said. The first two floors of the three-story
building were gutted.
   Another building in the palm-groved compound houses a small
nuclear reactor used for experiments, but it was about 500 yards
from the fire.
   ``There has been no leakage of any kind, neither chemical nor
nuclear,'' said Ion Siotis, director of the state-run institute. He
said there was no danger to the environment and called the research
reactor ``inherently safe.''
   Frightened residents telephoned police when they saw the fire at
the institute, but there was no evacuation, police said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Since mid-May, Athens has been rocked by weekly terrorist
attacks. Seven recent blasts have caused damage but no serious
injuries. But there was no immediate indication that the fire was
linked to terrorism.

   Firefighters on Saturday battled two major
forest fires that forced the evacuation of 2,000 vacationers from
campgrounds and cottages in southern France.
   More than 1,000 firefighters battled the blazes through the
night and declared them under control after they had burned about
2,220 acres of forest and brush. The cause of the fires was not
known.
   Seventeen people, including 15 firefighters, suffered light
burns or smoke inhalation, officials said. The fires destroyed one
villa and about 20 camping caravans.
   The fires, which broke out Friday in the Var region near Toulon,
were the biggest in France so far this summer. Much of southern
France has been plagued by drought for several years, and
summertime forest fires have become an annual occurrence.
   The evacuated vacationers spent the night at community halls,
gymnasiums or in the homes of local residents.

   ``One, two,'' the drill master barked
Saturday. ``One, two,'' the women of Beijing University's freshmen
class barked back.
   Then, arms swinging and faces stolid, they goose-stepped in
unison across the parade ground of the Shijiazhuang Military
Academy.
   This is how the first class to enter Beijing University after
last year's democracy movement spent the school year _ learning to
be good foot soldiers of the Communist revolution.
   Their training reflects the Chinese leadership's analysis of the
root cause of the massive 1989 student-led protests _ weak
ideological education. Its prescription for preventing further
unrest is to intensify political training and discipline.
   While older Beijing University students passed the school year
in glum cynicism after the violent quashing of the movement they
helped lead, the 728 freshmen spent 10 months training at
Shijiazhuang.
   At the army school 170 miles south of Beijing, they learned to
march, salute, shoot, throw grenades and roll their bedding with
military precision.
   They also read the works of Marx, Lenin and Chinese
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, and were lectured on the error
of the 1989 protests, which ended in an army attack that left at
least 300 people dead.
   Officials on Saturday showed the freshmen off to foreign
journalists allowed for the first time to visit them, 10 days
before the program ends. The class now faces four years of regular
coursework in Beijing.
   ``This experiment has been successful so far,'' said Beijing
University President Wu Shuqing.
   He said the next freshman class, which will number 1,600, will
undergo the same program. This year's class was reduced drastically
from the average 2,000 so the academy could accommodate it.
   ``It has toughened their confidence in socialism and invigorated
their determination to build a strong China,'' said the academy's
political commissar, Maj. Gen. Xiang Xu.
   A video prepared by the academy described the year's training as
a powerful formative and bonding experience, much like that
undergone by army recruits anywhere who have their egos broken down
to be rebuilt in a military image.
   ``We were critical, stubborn and sometimes naughty,'' said an
unidentified woman student who narrated the video. ``But gradually
... we were acclimatized and became part of the academy.
   ``We have never learned so much in one year,'' she said. ``What
we have gained will comfort us for the rest of our life.''
   Most Chinese high school and college students receive brief
military training, usually a few weeks of marching drills on campus
and a compulsory course in military history. That is as close as
most intellectuals get to soldiers, whom they tend to look down on
because most are poorly educated peasants.
   Political study also is mandatory at all levels of school, but
in recent years many college students skipped political classes or
paid little attention.
   At Shijiazhuang, the freshmen knew their lessons.
   ``Military training was a great good fortune,'' said 20-year-old
Han Tao, unit leader in his 12-bunk dormitory room, explaining why
he didn't mind spending five years at college instead of four.
   His roommate, Jiang Qinjun, said he might make friends with an
upperclassman who took part in the 1989 protests, but ``we can't
support their participation in the marches. If someone has an
incorrect understanding, we should educate them.''
   The key question is how long the academy's influence will last
once the freshmen are exposed to Beijing University's far
less-disciplined atmosphere. Some upperclassmen have said privately
they plan to re-educate the freshmen _ in politics and a
more-relaxed lifestyle.
   At the military academy, the freshmen have followed a strict
regimen _ up at 6 a.m. and in bed at 10 p.m. after a day of
exercise and study. No drinking and no romantic relationships are
allowed.
   The students wear standard army uniforms, and the women's hair
is clipped to chin length or shorter. Many jumped to attention when
approached by journalists.
   Xiang said the students could be relied on to ``rise in defense
of the state and the people'' if China faced foreign aggression.
   Wouldn't it be ironic, journalists asked, if some of the
freshmen put their new military skills to use during a future round
of student protests?
   ``I am confident my students will not do that,'' Xiang said. Of
course, he said, there are always ``a few individual scum _
exceptional cases.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state plans to resume aerial spraying of
the pesticide malathion to eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies this
week despite a study that says the material contains toxic heavy
metals.
   State officials say their tests show there's no threat to public
health.
   Helicopters will spray a 14-square-mile area of Los Angeles on
Thursday, state officials said Friday. The spraying was scheduled
for last week but was delayed after city attorneys presented the
findings of their analysis.
   The Mediterranean fruit fly, also called the Medfly, can destroy
hundreds of varieties of fruits and vegetables and is considered a
serious threat to the state's multibillion-dollar agriculture
economy.
   A study released by City Councilman Joel Wachs found that
samples of malathion contained excessive levels of lead, nickel and
chromium. Wachs said the presence of the metals violated strict
state limits on toxic substances and said he would seek a temporary
restraining order against the spraying Monday.
   Truesdail Laboratories in Tustin, Calif., conducted the
independent analysis of malathion for the city of Los Angeles.
   But state tests of the same samples found no dangerous levels of
heavy metals, state officials countered.
   ``The numbers our lab got are very low, in fact lower than that
in plain old soil,'' said James W. Stratton, who headed the state
Department of Health Services' review of the pesticide.
   ``The Department of Health Services has completed its latest
test and like all previous tests has determined that our malathion
spraying program poses no public health risk,'' said Henry J. Voss,
state agriculture director.
   The downtown spraying was ordered after a single female Medfly
was found near Dodger Stadium.
   Malathion was last sprayed in southern California on June 26 in
Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
   The state also plans to release millions of sterilized male
Medflies in an effort to interfere with reproduction.

   It's usually the pretrial publicity that
lawyers worry about, but little could rival the circuslike
aftermath of trial that cleared a 19-year-old woman of being an
accomplice to her mother's murder.
   The Hartford prosecutor's office has been besieged by angry
phone calls after the June 28 verdict, mostly from people who want
to see Karin Aparo behind bars along with her former lover, her
alleged accomplice.
   ``I've never, ever, ever seen anything like it,'' said an
employee in the office of Hartford State's Attorney John M. Bailey
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We've never had people call
this office and be so outraged.''
   Ms. Aparo's aunt _ her dead mother's sister _ has launched a
publicity campaign to counter what she calls the lust for blood
among those who believe Ms. Aparo was responsible for the 1987
death of her 47-year-old mother, Joyce Aparo.
   Though cleared of being an accomplice to murder, Ms. Aparo could
still face a retrial on a less serious charge of conspiracy, in
which the jury could not reach a verdict.
   Dennis Coleman, the former boyfriend, added to the trial's
bizarre conclusion when he gave a jailhouse interview to more than
a dozen reporters last week to denounce the verdict. He charged
jurors were taken in by Ms. Aparo's tears.
   Ms. Aparo, who shared a condominium with her mother in the
well-to-do Hartford suburb of Glastonbury, was accused of hatching
a plan when she was 15 to do away with her overbearing mother.
Prosecutors charged she recruited her love-struck boyfriend to ``do
the deed,'' as Coleman, now 22, referred to the alleged plot.
   Coleman, who confessed and is serving a 34-year sentence,
testified that his passion for Ms. Aparo went ``beyond obsession.''
   The defense successfully portrayed Ms. Aparo as an abused child
who fantasized about her mother's death but didn't enlist Coleman
to act on her fantasies. Instead, the defense said, Coleman broke
in while Karin was away and strangled Mrs. Aparo as she slept,
because he believed she was encouraging her daughter to sleep with
another man, the 24-year-old son of Karin's violin teacher.
   The four-week trial fixated Connecticut residents with details
about what Coleman described as the teen-age couple's ``active and
liberal'' sex life, including bondage with handcuffs and pantyhose.
   There was also bizarre testimony that Mrs. Aparo psychologically
abused her daughter, even insinuating her real father was
Hartford's Roman Catholic archbishop, a family friend. Michael
Aparo and Joyce Aparo were divorced when Karin was 5.
   The jury found Ms. Aparo innocent of being an accessory to her
mother's 1987 murder, but deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on
the conspiracy charge.
   By Thursday, the prosecutor's office had logged more than 150
calls, all but a handful from people who want to see Ms. Aparo
retried on the second charge.
   The Journal Inquirer, a newspaper that has covered the trial
closely, added its voice to the chorus urging a second trial,
suggesting that everyone who believed Ms. Aparo was innocent might
fit into one room. ``Lucky for Karin, it was the jury room in
Hartford Superior Court,'' an editorial said.
   A number of callers were upset by the behavior of jury foreman
Richard Meister, who winked at Ms. Aparo before the verdict was
announced and was later shown on television hugging her outside the
courthouse and stroking her hair.
   Meister said he justed wanted to spare Ms. Aparo a few seconds
of agony before the verdict was announced, but some people
interpreted the wink as inappropriate intimacy.
   One irate Aparo-watcher called Bailey's office and charged the
jury, made up of four women and eight men, found Aparo ``innocent
by reason of an advanced case of the hots.''
   Ina Camblor, Ms. Aparo's aunt, calls the public response
``lunacy'' and complains that those who are unhappy with the
verdict ``don't want justice, they want blood.''
   She's asking those who share her feelings to write Bailey and
Gov. William A. O'Neill to urge that the state drop the remaining
charge against her niece. So far, about 30 people have done so, she
said.
   Ms. Aparo's defense attorney, Hubert Santos, filed motions
Tuesday to dismiss the remaining charge, arguing that a ``lynch-mob
atmosphere'' in Connecticut makes a fair second trial impossible.
   Bailey says he won't decide whether to retry Ms. Aparo for a few
weeks, to give himself time to step back from the emotions of the
case.

   Norway issued a sharp protest to the
Soviet Union after five Soviet soldiers and a Norwegian fisherman
were involved in a border incident, the national news agency NTB
reported Saturday.
   Norway said the Soviet soldiers entered 110 yards into Norwegian
territory and chased fisherman Werner Pedersen, 45. Norwegian
border official Edward Larsen said the Soviets fired at Pedersen
but he was not wounded.
   According to the Soviets, Pedersen was fishing on the Soviet
side and was chased back into Norway.
   The incident occurred Thursday. Norway and the Soviet Union
share a border within the Arctic Circle, near the Soviet port of
Murmansk.
   Sergei Komissarov, deputy chief of the Soviet embassy in Oslo,
was called to the foreign ministry Friday to give an explanation of
the incident and to hear Norway's protest.

<HEAD>Bargainers Slog Away While Colleagues Make Political Hay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The rhetoric swirled through the marble
corridors of the Capitol. Republicans and Democrats alike hauled
out their most colorful, cataclysmic language and vowed a battle
royal should anyone dare to raise taxes.
   All the while, in a room across the hall from the Senate
chamber, the men who actually might decide if taxes would be raised
hunkered down and got to work.
   ``It was kind of like being in the eye of a storm,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., one of those in
the quiet bargaining room.
   The issue that day last month was taxes after President Bush
abandoned his staunch anti-tax stance. But the scene is the same
every day that negotiators for the White House and Congress try to
shrink the federal deficit while their colleagues play the issues
for all their political worth.
   The negotiators' ability to seek compromise while the rest of
the Capitol rings with partisan clamor reflects two overriding
factors: their perspective about the task they've been assigned and
the personalities of the people involved.
   The bargainers must look at the federal budget from exactly the
opposite perspective that most members of Congress usually have.
   The negotiators are looking for $50 billion in new taxes and
spending cuts for next year and about $500 billion over the next
five years, a search that entails nothing but thorny choices.
   They know that if they fail, the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget
law will automatically cut tens of billions of dollars from most
programs this fall.
   Most lawmakers, on the other hand, see their jobs as a constant
battle to bring federal dollars back home and to protect their
districts from pain.
   ``These people sitting around the table are staring the deficit
problem in the face,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member
of the House Budget Committee who is not one of the negotiators.
``Members of Congress are staring their constituents in the face.''
   Participants in the talks are aware of this dichotomy, and say
that reacting to it is a crucial part of their job.
   ``If we don't keep our lines of communication open to those
members and make sure they have input, we may come down from the
mountaintop with an agreement that nobody is prepared to vote
for,'' said one of the bargainers, House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   The talks have been moving slowly for two months. But
participants say the negotiating has gotten more serious since
Bush's reversal on his tax position.
   Bargainers would like to complete a deal on a package before the
beginning of the August congressional recess. Negotiations resume
Tuesday.
   Another reason for the negotiators' single-mindedness is the
personality and political instincts of many of the people in the
bargaining room _ and their bosses.
   By historical accident, many of the key figures are moderate,
consensus-building politicians who believe that compromise is what
effective governing is all about.
   Bush, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, all fit that mold.
President Ronald Reagan and former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, did not.
   ``There's no Jim Wright in there,'' said Rep. Vin Weber,
R-Minn., one of the House's most conservative members. ``There
isn't even a Tip O'Neill,'' the Massachusetts Democrat who as
speaker was a persistent liberal champion during the Reagan years.
   Ideologues are few among the negotiators, with the best examples
being the staunchly anti-tax Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, No. 2 House
Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia and the White House chief of
staff, John Sununu.
   Sasser, a former chairman of his state's Democratic Party, and
No. 3 House Democratic leader William H. Gray of Pennsylvania are
perhaps the most partisan of the Democratic bargainers.
   The bargaining teams are loaded with lawmakers who have been
through the budget wars before and who seem inclined to compromise
to deal with the deficit. These include Panetta; Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M.; Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.; and the White House
Budget Director, Richard Darman.
   ``You're dealing with people,'' said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn.,
``who really are willing to give a little bit of their own agenda
to achieve the goal of deficit reduction.''

   When George and Barbara Bush called Houston home,
they often stopped by a no-frills Tex-Mex restaurant on the poor
side of town and dined on beef fajitas and spicy green sauce.
   They also frequented Patterson Hardware, like other weekend home
warriors, picking up tools to fix their two-story pink brick house
and to putter in the garden.
   The Bushes visit Houston only infrequently now, and the nation's
first couple calls a Houstonian hotel suite their home away from
home. But local folks still have fond memories of them.
   ``They're beautiful people. They've always been very
down-to-earth,'' says Ninfa Laurenzo, owner of the chain of Ninfa's
restaurants, which specialize in Tex-Mex fare.
   ``I think he's going to be very busy,'' Laurenzo says when asked
if he thinks the president might visit his old haunt. ``He has a
pretty full agenda. But there's always a chance he'll stop by.''
   In fact, the tight summit schedule doesn't include any stop at
Bush's old favorites. But the president is known for his
spontaneity. One time, his motorcade paid a surprise visit to
Molina's, another Tex-Mex restaurant, where Bush is fond of the
Tejas enchiladas.
   A few miles from the Houstonian is Hunan, an elegant Chinese
restaurant and another Bush favorite. On New Year's the first
couple even ordered some takeout from the restaurant that was
delivered to their suite at the Houstonian.
   Manager Gigi Huang, whose father owns Hunan, said she hasn't
been informed of any presidential visit. Like Mrs. Laurenzo, she
says any visit will be last minute.
   ``George and Barbara Bush have been dining with us for about the
past 12 years,'' she said. ``When they lived in Houston, we would
see them about once a week or every other week.''
   ``He really enjoys the people and Mrs. Bush is very friendly,
and down-to-earth,'' she said. ``She's very real. We always enjoy
seeing them.''
   When they had some household chores to do, they went to
Patterson Hardware, where owner Bill Collins remembers them as
``just plain customers like everybody else. They owned a home and
they did their own upkeep. They weren't afraid to get their hands
dirty.''
   Despite the dilapidated surroundings, the festive Ninfa's with
its colorful decor attracts an affluent but casual crowd hungry for
the traditional south-of-the border fare.
   The area is strikingly different from the manicured lawns and
sprawling brick homes of Tanglewood, an expensive neighborhood in
west Houston where the Bushes lived after the he moved his oil
company to the city.
   Then-oilman Bush moved his family from Midland, Texas to Houston
some 31 years ago. He became Harris County Chairman Republican
chairman in 1962, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1964,
won a seat in Congress in 1966. He sold his 6 percent stake in
Zapata Petroleum at the time for $1.1 million.
   The Bushes also remain members of St. Martin's Episcopal Church,
a brown brick church in Tanglewood. The Rev. Edward Stein said Bush
has been to services at St. Martin's about three times since being
elected president in 1988.

<HEAD>Global Warming, Rain Forests To Dominate Summit Environmental
Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World leaders will focus on global warming and
the destruction of rain forests at the economic summit, but they
are unlikely to do enough to satisfy environmentalists.
   President Bush and his six summit partners are expected to sign
a communique outlining how they will cooperate on international
environmental issues.
   Several environmental groups, who will be on hand with an
``environmental scorecard'' to grade the summit, are skeptical
about what the leaders of the industrial nations will accomplish.
   ``The people of the world want more than just communiques that
sound environmental; they want policies that are environmentally
sound,'' said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental
Defense Fund.
   Global warming _ the so-called greenhouse effect _ has emerged
as a thorny international environmental issue. Scientists say
gaseous emissions trap solar heat causing a gradual warming of the
earth.
   While several European nations already have plans to reduce or
stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 of 2005, Bush
contends more research is needed on global warming before such
dramatic steps need be taken.
   In advance of the summit, U.S. officials said participants are
expected to agree on the outlines of an international convention,
to be held by 1992, to discuss global warming.
   But the officials, speaking on condition they remain anonymous,
said they appear to have avoided what could have been a bruising
battle at the summit with European nations over the reduction of
gaseous emissions.
   The officials said the Europeans seem to be willing to back away
from their previous insistence that specific reduction goals be set
at the summit. Led by Germany, some countries had sought a
commitment to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions or reduce them by
up to 25 percent by the end of the decade.
   There is still wrangling, however, over when the nations should
begin work on agreements to formally spell out how they will fight
global warming, administration officials said.
   Two other contentious areas involve curtailing the destruction
of tropical forests and setting up an international ``green fund''
to help developing countries protect their environments.
   The United States is not anxious to sign any agreements curbing
the destruction of tropical forests, but one official said: ``I'm
not going to throw down my body in front of a train'' if others
nations devise a plan.
   The summiteers are expected to agree on strengthening the
Tropical Forestry Action Plan that was conceived in the mid-1980s
by the World Bank and other international organizations.
   The plan channels international investment into tropical
countries to help them develop land use policies that will help
save forests.
   The plan's critics say so far the projects selected to receive
money ignore forestry protection goals. There is a general feeling
among the summit partners that a tougher plan is needed, one U.S.
official said.
   Meantime, the World Bank is viewed as the most likely vehicle to
administer a ``green fund'' to provide money for developing
nations' environmental projects.
   But the Bush administration will oppose a separately financed
``green fund,'' at the World Bank, which lends money to poor
countries for various projects. One administration official said
the United States would probably go along with a ``green fund'' if
it were paid for out of existing resources _ a position some
Europeans would oppose.
   Bush, in an attempt to blunt any criticism of the United States
as reticent on global warming or other issues, intends to tell his
summit partners at Tuesday's environmental session about recent
U.S. environmental accomplishments.
   Officials say he will recite a series of steps that when
combined, according to administration projections, would stabilize
or even reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the decade.
   They include: the Clean Air Act still pending in Congress,
Bush's plan to plant 1 billion trees a year and purchase wilderness
areas, and the U.S. commitment to the elimination of
ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000.
   The economic summit communique is likely to include endorsement
of the recent 93-nation agreement in London to wipe out
chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that deplete the earth's protective
ozone layer, by the end of the decade.

   The Communist Party chief says the leaders of the
seven industrialized powers should avoid meddling in China's
internal affairs at their annual economic summit in Houston this
week.
   Jiang Zemin said the Group of Seven should ``confine themselves
to discussion of economic and other issues among themselves,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said in a report Saturday that
paraphrased his remarks.
   Jiang was interviewed Friday by Noboru Watanabe, president of
the Japanese Mainichi Newspaper Group.
   During the two-hour interview, Jiang also disclosed that the
party has been unable to resolve the case of former party chief
Zhao Ziyang. Zhao was stripped of all his posts in June 1989 for
supporting a student-led, pro-democracy movement, but he has not
been brought to trial.
   During their three-day summit, the leaders of the seven
industrialized nations are expected to discuss lifting economic
sanctions they imposed on China after its brutal suppression of
last year's pro-democracy movement.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan will push for ending the
economic sanctions imposed on China, but his bid to unfreeze $5.2
billion worth of development loans is opposed by other summit
countries.
   Besides Japan, the summit participants include the United
States, Canada, Britain, West Germany, Italy and France.
   ``Some Western countries are very unwise to have imposed
economic sanctions on China, as this will bring about no positive
result but will, instead, arouse the Chinese people's resentment,''
Jiang said.
   Many Chinese citizens initially welcomed the sanctions, saying
the government should be punished in some way for killing hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of people to crush the democracy movement.
   However, there have been more appeals recently for lifting of
the sanctions, which some say are beginning to hurt the Chinese
people.
   Japan, the only Asian member of the Group of Seven, already has
eased its ban on loans to China, granting two loans last week for
$16 million to be used to improve drinking water.
   Japan acted after China lifted martial law in Beijing, released
nearly 900 people arrested for joining the democracy movement, and
allowed dissident Fang Lizhi to leave the U.S. Embassy and go into
exile in England.
   ``If (the Western nations) interfere in the affairs of other
countries, (I am) afraid that would not be proper,'' Jiang said.
   His remarks contrasted with a Foreign Ministry statement last
week urging the Group of Seven to ``take timely, positive steps by
seizing the opportunity to improve relations with China.''
   Jiang was also asked about Zhao, who has not been seen in public
for more than 13 months.
   ``He is still a party member and no change has been made in his
treatment in terms of material well-being,'' Jiang said. Chinese
leaders had previously said Zhao was living in his home and
continuing to draw his regular salary.
   In the weeks after Zhao's purge, party leaders hinted strongly
that he would face criminal charges for supporting the democracy
movement, which China considers a counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   But Jiang's disclosure that the case was still under
investigation suggests that a strong reform element still exists
within the party.

   Welcome to the L'Esperance home, where
kids will be kids will be kids will be kids will be kids. And
that's just the quintuplets, the nation's first test-tube set.
   Besides the 2{-year-old quints, Michele and Raymond L'Esperance
have three sons from previous marriages and now are caring for
three nieces at their home about 30 miles north of Detroit. That's
11 kids, if you're counting.
   It hasn't been easy. Food costs $350 weekly, the telephone was
briefly cut off last month for non-payment, the couple worried
their electricity was next and handed their limousine, the only
vehicle that could carry all the kids, back to the finance company.
Raymond, 29, is a Macomb County Jail guard, bringing in $26,000
yearly; his wife, 36, works at a shelter for battered women.
   Recent publicity over the couple's tight finances upset the
family, Mrs. L'Esperance said. She says they can care for their
children, but needed a foster-home license _ and the increased
state aid it would bring _ to care for her sister's brood.
   ``Why take them from family?'' she said in a terse interview
outside the family's two-story colonial home, as she held one of
the two horses they keep on their 10-acre spread.
   Oakland County Probate Judge Barry Grant was angered at a
hearing last week on the license requested five weeks ago. He
ordered the state Department of Social Services to explain why it
hasn't acted on the couple's request to waive rules that normally
exclude a family with eight or more children from being a foster
home.
   ``This is government bureaucracy at its worst,'' Grant said.
   Chuck Peller, a spokesman for the department, said the
foster-home license decision was delayed because the family only
recently filled out the needed paperwork.
   As foster parents, the L'Esperances would receive about $1,000
monthly for their nieces rather than $295 in welfare they now get.
   The L'Esperances told Grant that private donations will let them
keep their nieces regardless of the government's decision. Outside
court, they won't talk about money. ``I'd rather let sleeping dogs
lie,'' Mrs. L'Esperance said.
   The couple apparently once expected that commercial endorsements
would offset the sudden costs of Erica, Veronica, Danielle,
Alexandria and Raymond Jr., born 10 weeks premature in January 1988.
   ``No endorsements occurred. Multiple births had become a lot
more common,'' said attorney Thomas Plunkett, who was hired to
negotiate contracts. Even being the country's first quints
conceived through in-vitro fertilization didn't land offers, he
said.
   There were donations _ limousine rides from the hospital, cribs,
clothing and toys. And Gerber Products Co. still pays for any food,
clothes or other company items the family uses. It will do the same
for any quints, company spokesman James Lovejoy said.
   Because of its offer for multiple births, Gerber keeps records.
They show U.S. multiple births _ which often result from the use of
fertility drugs _ have increased 128 percent since 1983. Last year,
the company had four sets of quints, 37 sets of quadruplets and 402
sets of triplets in its free product program, Lovejoy said.
   ``Two-and-a-half? It gets worse. This is the easy time. It gets
tough,'' said Peggy Jo Kienast of Far Hills, N.J., whose
20-year-old quints are now in college.
   ``Of course, we had all sorts of people giving them clothes,''
she said in a telephone interview last week. ``I wish I could offer
words of encouragement. You do what you can.''
   The Kienast quints, the nation's second surviving set, have been
featured in commercials ranging from cough drops to sneakers and on
national talk shows. Amy, Abby, Sara, Ted and Gordon as children
were signed with the William Morris Agency, a talent agency.
   But there were financial problems. An anonymous donor provided
$115,000 to pay off mortgages and prevent the family's eviction in
1983, but William Kienast killed himself the next year, after a
business venture failed.
   The L'Esperances married in 1986, using $4,000 for in-vitro
fertilization rather than holding a fancy wedding. In that
procedure, a woman receives fertility drugs to stimulate ovum
production. The eggs are surgically removed, mixed with sperm and
reimplanted.
   Last year, Mrs. L'Esperance's nieces, ages 6, 10 and 13, moved
in. Their parents, who are unemployed, told the court last week
that they would receive alcoholism treatment, said Grant's clerk,
John Chamberlain.

   A 4-year-old boy has died after being
found inside a camp cooler fitted with a latch that locked
automatically when the lid dropped.
   Jacob Green was found unconscious late Friday inside the old
metal cooler stored underneath a work bench in the family garage,
police said.
   The boy was declared dead on arrival at Valley Memorial Hospital.
   Jacob's mother, Kary Green, had called police during the
afternoon to report the boy missing. About 150 people assisted by
police dogs and a helicopter searched the surrounding area.

<HEAD>Organizations Reach Out to Flood Victims _ Gradually</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some victims of last month's deadly flash
flooding in villages off the west bank of the Ohio River are
struggling to cope with the bureaucracy and confusion of relief
organizations.
   Most of the attention has been focused on the Wegee and Pipe
Creek communities south of this Belmont County village. On the
night of June 14, at least 26 people died when flash floods
rampaged down Wegee and Pipe creeks.
   But residents of several smaller villages _ Dillonvale, Adena,
Newtown, Rayland, Mount Pleasant and Connorville _ just to the
north in Jefferson County, suffered as well when Short Creek and
its tributaries went out of control the same night.
   Dillonvale Mayor Leon Bailey said his valley suffered far more
damage than Wegee and Pipe Creek, although with no deaths, and
fears rural Jefferson County is being shortchanged because of the
attention given Shadyside.
   The American Red Cross said it has issued $180,600 in vouchers
to Belmont County residents and $207,400 in vouchers in Jefferson
County. Red Cross spokesman Doug Skroback said Jefferson County
reported almost twice as many houses damaged as did Belmont County.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business
Administration and the Ohio Emergency Management Agency are making
grants and loans as specific problems and costs are identified and
applications approved.
   FEMA reports 3,059 registrations for help from the Ohio counties
that were declared a federal disaster area as a result of recent
severe weather. It has disbursed $1.1 million in disaster housing
aid statewide and paid $600,000 in individual and family grants.
   Marion S. Szypkowski, 76, and his wife, Nancy, were evacuated
from their Dillonvale home by rowboat with little more than their
nightclothes. Water from Short Creek caved in the front wall of
their basement, making their home unsafe. They moved in with a
friend, but so far no one else has offered any help.
   ``I filled out an application for FEMA a week ago,'' said Mrs.
Szypkowski. ``I turned it in at the church like they said. And I've
called that 800 number several times that they gave me, but they
haven't got it yet.''
   ``I can't afford a loan,'' Szypkowski said, adding that his only
income is from Social Security. He has estimates of $800 to $1,100
labor costs to rebuild his basement wall, plus the cost of
materials.
   FEMA officials held a town meeting last week to explain to
Dillonvale residents how the agency makes cash grants for
relocation or immediate repairs to dwellings.
   Rob Svoboda walked out of the meeting after heatedly asking why
some people are charged 8 percent for loans and others get grants
or lower interest loans.
   ``I applied to FEMA and I made out well, but those on fixed
income are getting stuck,'' said Svoboda, 26, an electronics
technician at a steel mill.
   Village leaders in Shadyside, Dillonvale and Adena have
organized to accept and distribute money and materials donated to
help flood victims.
   The Rev. David Baker, president of the Shadyside Fellowship of
Churches, says more than $300,000 has been donated to the Shadyside
Relief Fund Inc.
   Baker hopes fund managers can start distributing the money by
mid-July. He expects the fund will aid about 115 households hardest
hit by the flood.
   ``Getting the organization set up and running properly is taking
longer than expected,'' said Baker, pastor of United Methodist
Church. Attorneys, accountants and other specialists are donating
their expertise to be certain the distribution is properly handled.
   Adena, a dozen miles up Short Creek, has a little more than
$5,000 in its local relief fund, but Chet Masloski, whose wife is
coordinating the fund, said the town has 153 damaged houses.
   ``Any of those we can help won't get much,'' he said.

   On inauguration day, President
Fernando Collor de Mello promised a better life in 100 days, but
recession looms, strikes abound and grumbling has begun about his
anti-inflation shock therapy.
   Their flamboyant new president stunned the 150 million
Brazilians in March by freezing bank accounts as part of his
drastic program of bringing down annual inflation of nearly 5,000
percent.
   He was immensely popular at first, but that is changing.
   ``The shock was cruel, monstrous and unnecessary,'' Paul Singer,
an economics professor and planning secretary for the city of Sao
Paulo, said in an interview.
   Collor, 40, is Brazil's first freely elected president since
1961. He took office March 15, promising a ``new Brazil'' and
reform of the bloated, corrupt bureaucracy.
   He said the first task was to reduce inflation drastically and
eliminate a $31 billion budget deficit.
   On March 16, he announced an 18-month freeze on 80 percent of
the money in savings accounts and financial markets; price
controls; a new currency, and an end to numbered bank accounts.
   Police made showcase arrests of bank and supermarket managers
accused of not complying with the plan. Cheering crowds gathered as
the executives were taken away. They were released later.
   To set an example of austerity, Collor abolished half the 24
government ministries and ordered the sale of 42 government-owned
mansions and 10,177 apartments formerly used by top officials
rent-free.
   Thousands of official cars were auctioned in lots with signs
proclaiming, ``The End of Perks.''
   Dozens of the 188 state-owned companies were put up for sale.
Import taxes and trade barriers for thousands of imports were
lowered or dropped.
   Automatic cost-of-living pay raises were eliminated. Collor said
360,000 of the government's 1.4 million employees would be fired by
June 18.
   Official inflation fell from 84 percent a month in March to 3.3
percent in April, and the government said it soon would be zero.
Brazilians were elated.
   ``The Collor government can be accused of almost anything in
these first 100 days except indolence, sluggishness or monotony,''
the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo said in an editorial called ``A
Hundred Days that Shook the Country.''
   Collor's style appealed to the poor majority of Brazilians, who
provided his main election support.
   He personally checked prices at a supermarket and opened a $100
bank account to encourage saving. He tested an army tank, flew an
F-5E jet fighter, toured a remote Amazon Indian reservation in
combat fatigues, spent weekends riding jet-skis and motorcycles,
jogging, bicycling and kayaking.
   A poll in May gave him a 74 percent approval rating.
   His economic plan soon ran into trouble, however. The freeze on
accounts slowed the economy to a crawl. Sales plummeted, companies
began laying off workers and the country slid toward recession.
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and its financial center,
47,447 workers were fired in May alone, the highest one-month total
since 1981. Unemployment in Sao Paulo rose to a record 12 percent.
   ``It was a case of killing the cow to get rid of a tick,'' said
Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, who ran
against Collor for president.
   Unions said inflation was much higher than the government
admitted. Their figures ranged up to 44 percent a month.
   Collor's announced plans for layoffs led to strikes at
government companies that run the docks, railroads and oil industry.
   Inflation refused to go away. Prices rose 8 percent in May and
nearly 10 percent in June, according to official figures.
   ``It was an error for the government to talk about zero
inflation,'' said Sen. Roberto Campos, a former planning minister.
``Inflation of 7 or 8 a month is great progress, but the goal
became too ambitious.''
   Opponents were nettled by Collor's habit of enacting key reforms
by decree, then sending them to the congress for approval. Many
likened that to the decree-laws of the military governmnts of
1964-1985.
   When legislators prepared to vote on the economic plan, Collor
told them not to ``meddle'' with it.
   ``He tries to act like a prince of the Brazilian aristocracy,''
Brizola said. ``It's been 100 days of impositions.''
   The target of 360,000 layoffs by June 18 was not reached. Some
critics even questioned the government's claim that 90,000 were
fired, retired or sent home with pay. One estimate put the figure
at 41,000.
   ``There's more smoke than fire,'' David Fleischer, a professor
of political science at the University of Brasilia, said in an
interview. ``The popularity of the plan is sustained by imagery and
the use of television. When the government gets in trouble, Collor
goes on TV. He's very skillful.''
   A Supreme Court ruling that some reforms were unconstitutional
did not help the government's credibility. New bank deposits by
small savers declined and businessmen found ways to ``unblock''
their frozen assets.
   Fleischer said: ``The plan destroyed the faith of people in the
savings account system, which took 15 or 20 years to build up. The
government was naive.''
   A poll taken in June said only 36 percent of those rated
Collor's performance good or excellent job, 43 percent said average
and 19 percent classed it as bad or terrible.
   His press spokesman, Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva, said the
president was misunderstood.
   ``Everything that was promised is being done,'' he said in an
interview. The layoffs of govenment employees were not intended to
be finished by June 18, he said, but will reach or exceed 360,000
by 1994.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Helmut Kohl received an honorary
doctorate at Harvard University a month ago, the West German
chancellor was lauded as a ``German Hercules'' for his role at the
head of one of the world's richest nations.
   The comparison may be apt. Kohl is a strong position to become
the first chancellor of a united Germany. And as military might
recedes as a measure of world power, Germany is certain to expand
its international influence as an economic giant.
   Kohl has not been shy about wielding his influence. He has
bluntly called the 1990s ``the decade of the Europeans.''
   He has become a champion of economic aid for the Soviet Union, a
message he will take to the economic summit in Houston after
raising the issue at the just-ended NATO meeting in London.
   In Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, the chancellor notes
approvingly, there is already talk of applying for membership in
the European Community following the collapse of communism.
   For Kohl, the greater the steps toward full European
integration, the greater the chances for stability that will extend
the continent's longest period without war in centuries.
   The conservative Christian Democrat, 60, has been in office
nearly eight years. Still, he retains many of the folksy touches
that appeal to the solid conservative majority at home, and a
similar bloc of voters in East Germany.
   During the NATO summit, Kohl sat and regaled reporters for more
than an hour late one night, mixing a keen sense of history, humor
and frequent stinging barbs at the politicians he has known over
the years.
   Diplomatically, Kohl strictly banned any repeat of those
comments, but his closing news conference on Friday brought out
several quips.
   Asked the reason for his close ties with U.S. President George
Bush, the chancellor said: ``Well, right off, I could say it's
because we are such good politicians. That's the first answer that
comes to mind.
   ``Of course, that's not the answer I'll give, but I naturally
like it when people say and write that,'' the chancellor added with
a smile.
   Instead, Kohl said of his relationship with Bush, ``the
chemistry is right, as you say in the United States.''
   When asked about an apparent rift in East Berlin over NATO
membership for a united Germany, Kohl said such the dispute was ``a
specialty of the East German government.'' He quickly added that
occasional disagreements are hallmarks of democratically elected
governments.
   A man of huge dimensions _ 6-feet-3-inches tall and 235 pounds _
Kohl towers over most of his European counterparts.
   Two of those leaders, 64-year-old British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand often
bicker predictably at European summits.
   That has left Kohl in charge of much of the EC's direction,
guiding the community's integration on a parallel track with German
unification.
   The twofold strategy is important for a country still acutely
aware of international wariness of a powerful Germany after the
catastrophic experiences of two World Wars.
   ``We have learned the lessons of history,'' Kohl told the Bush
and the 14 other NATO leaders, echoing a statement he has made time
and again.
   Kohl once infuriated Jews by referring to the ``mercy of those
born later,'' which Jewish leaders interpreted as an attempt on the
part of younger Germans to wash their hands of the Holocaust.
   Despite that and other occasional gaffes, the chancellor has
held on to power during some of the most tumultuous years in his
country's nearly 41-year history.
   They include the massive resistance to the installation of
medium-range nuclear missiles in West Germany in 1983 and the East
German unrest that broke down the Berlin Wall last November.
   Earlier this year, there were predictions that Kohl could get
hit by an anti-unification backlash among West Germans tired of
seeing their country awash in handout-seeking East Germans.
   However, two recent public opinion polls indicate that Kohl has
regained the momentum in his bid to become the first chancellor of
a united Germany after joint elections expected in December.
   A poll conducted by the respected INFAS institute and released
Friday said Kohl enjoys a 56 percent approval rating, compared with
37 percent for his Social Democratic challenger Oskar Lafontaine.
   The SPD and others have criticized Kohl, saying he has been
pushing forward with unification too quickly at the risk of
creating instability in East Germany.

   Move over Princess Di, meet Princess
Kiko.
   The 23-year-old Kiko, who eight days ago was a graduate student
living in an apartment with her middle-class family, is now a
national celebrity after her marriage to Prince Akishino and is
greeted by large, adoring crowds.
   Even her choice of hats is subject to the close scrutiny of
television's gossipy morning variety shows.
   But as she and Prince Akishino, 24, Emperor Akihito's youngest
son, concluded their three-day ``honeymoon'' with a visit to an
imperial tomb in this western Japan city Saturday, the newest
addition to Japan's royal family couldn't have looked more composed.
   Walking slowly a few steps behind her new husband, Princess Kiko
nodded to a crowd of several hundred guests at the tomb of the
legendary Emperor Jimmu, a semigod who according to myth was
Japan's first monarch.
   ``She's so much more beautiful in person,'' gushed one
middle-aged woman in the crowd. ``I like the way she smiles.''
   ``Kiko-sama,'' as she is respectfully known, is only the second
commoner to marry into Japan's imperial family. Akishino's mother,
Empress Michiko, was the first when she wed then crown-prince
Akihito in 1959.
   The empress, however, was raised in a decidedly upper-class
home, while her new daughter-in-law is the daughter of a college
professor of far more humble means.

   A federal judge has awarded $3,000 to a
filmmaker who sued talk show host Geraldo Rivera for broadcasting
part of his documentary on mass murderer Charles Manson without
permission.
   Robert Hendrickson claimed victory even though U.S. District
Judge Ronald S.W. Lew awarded him far less than the $310,000 he was
seeking from Rivera.
   ``It's all exclusive film. That's what the court has ruled,''
said Hendrickson, 45. ``I won the copyright issue against the best
copyright lawyers in Beverly Hills. I think that's something.''
   Hendrickson, who acted as his own attorney in the case, filed
his suit in May 1989, a month after Rivera aired excerpts from the
1972 documentary ``Manson'' in a televised special called ``Murder
_ Live From Death Row.''
   Rivera's attorneys argued that Rivera's production company,
Investigative News Group of New York, had paid a video distributor
$3,000 to use the excerpts. Hendrickson said the deal was made
without his permission.
   Tribune Entertainment and KTLA-TV, which aired the Rivera
special, also were named in the suit.
   Lew ruled Thursday that Investigative News Group did infringe on
a copyright on the documentary. But he dismissed most of
Hendrickson's damages claim, including $42,000 the filmmaker said
Rivera should have paid him to use the footage.
   The judge ordered Investigative News Group, Tribune
Entertainment and KTLA-TV to jointly pay the award.
   Actress Sharon Tate and four others were murdered at her
Benedict Canyon home on Aug. 9, 1969. Wealthy market owner Leno
LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, were killed at their Los Feliz
home the next night.
   Convicted with Manson were Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwrinkle,
Leslie Van Houten and Charles ``Tex'' Watson. All are serving life
sentences.

   Actor Gene Hackman was in good condition
Saturday, recovering from an operation doctors hope will help the
screen toughguy avert a heart attack.
   Hackman, 60, was getting diet and exercise instruction at St.
Vincent Hospital &amp; Medical Center, said Mary Jane Bonesteele, a
nursing supervisor.
   ``We don't know anything about the time for his release,'' she
said. ``He is finishing up with what we need to teach him as as a
patient.''
   Hackman checked into St. Vincent on Tuesday after experiencing
chest pain while vacationing on the Oregon coast.
   His cardiologist, Dr. Herbert Semler, said Thursday that doctors
who examined Hackman detected a narrowing of an artery leading to
his heart.
   A balloon catheter was used to dilate the blood vessel. Semler
said that without the procedure, the artery would have closed,
possibly bringing on a heart attack.
   Hackman's most acclaimed role came in 1971's ``The French
Connection,'' in which he played a rough-and-tumble narcotics cop.
His other screen credits include ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Hawaii,'' and ``Hoosiers.''

   The nation's largest teachers' union
issued a report Saturday calling for a gradual end to the
controversial practice of grouping students according to past
performance.
   Robert Chase, vice president of the National Education
Association, said it would be ``foolhardy and unrealistic to expect
that tracking can be eliminated overnight,'' but said the union
will offer strategies to better arrange class groupings.
   Academic tracking has become a hot educational issue as U.S.
students continue to test poorly in basic subjects. Opponents
complain that minorities are too often placed into low ability and
special education classes. Proponents argue tracking is needed so
high achievers can move rapidly.
   ``We must give students an education that will open up their
options for the future, not close them,'' said Chase at a news
conference at the annual convention of the union representing 2
million educators.
   Chase pointed to a Carnegie study issued two years ago that
found 63 percent of all U.S. teachers considered tracking useful.
   The report, based on a commissioned Johns Hopkins University
study, said students can benefit from tracking, but only under very
specific conditions.
   Sue Hovey of Moscow, Idaho, who worked on the NEA report, said
students should be grouped only for specific skills, like reading,
rather than by general ability. Also, group assignments should be
frequently reassessed.
   The report said most schools track students by segregating them
all or most of the day according to general achievement or
behavior, rather than by abilities in specific subjects.
   The study found that groupings in elementary and secondary
schools are hard to break out of and are likely to create racially
identifiable classes.
   Leon Horne, an NEA executive committee member who chaired the
task force handling the report, said the study also found that
minorities are significantly underrepresented in classes that are
prerequisites to higher level courses.
   Without these courses, Horne said, many students are prevented
from pursuing careers in advanced fields like science and
engineering.
   Two years ago, the union proposed and debated a resolution
calling for an end to academic tracking ``based on socioeconomic
status, race, or sex.'' Saturday's report came from a task force
appointed then to study the issue further.

   This one was supposed to be different. According
to traditionalists and reformers alike, the 28th congress of the
Soviet Communist Party would be a bitter struggle for the future of
the party.
   But halfway through their agenda, the nearly 4,700 delegates
meeting in the Kremlin have been able to do little more than erect
a facade of unity on a foundation of words rather than action.
   The most powerful assembly of the most powerful organization in
Soviet society appears dispirited and near ideological bankruptcy.
   In the words of Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev: ``The
party of the revolutionary idea has turned into the party of
power.''
   Soviet society, taking advantage of the changes under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, will pursue reforms no matter what course the party
chooses, Yakovlev said.
   But the new ideas, however modest, are being rejected by the
congress.
   Rank-and-file delegates are confused. New faces are certain to
appear in the party leadership, but it is far from certain that
personnel changes will be enough to bolster the party's sagging
authority.
   The congress sharpened the rhetoric Soviets first heard at a
party conference two years ago and at the governmental Congress of
People's Deputies last year.
   Then, it was breath of freedom to watch the verbal duels between
reformer Boris N. Yeltsin and more traditional Yegor K. Ligachev.
Live broadcasts were curtailed because people were watching instead
of working.
   In March, looking ahead to the congress, Ligachev said it would
mean ``the fixing of boundaries, and the cleansing from the party
of all those who are destroying it, who are engaging in a
factional, opposition struggle and who are participating in
anti-socialist movements.''
   On Friday, Yeltsin warned that the party could not simply
discard those Ligachev considered troublemakers. He said they would
demand their share of the party's property, or that the property be
nationalized.
   Just has he has for years, Gorbachev continued to steer a middle
course, successfully avoiding the open split that had been promised
by radical delegates. ``Consolidation'' was one of the congress
buzzwords, but it seemed to apply to preserving the party rather
than forging new policies.
   Delegates seemed subdued rather than energized by months of
buildup. The lack of anything new drove some party members to
despair.
   On the opening day of the congress, Rafael Belyalov, a composer
and party official in the city of Kazan, announced he was quitting
the party.
   ``I did not wait until the end of the 28th congress, since I was
sure that nothing is changing,'' the Postfactum news service quoted
him as saying.
   Delegate Yuri Boldyrev from Leningrad urged nationalization of
the party's property on the first day of the congress and said 57
percent of the active party constituents in his district agreed
with him.
   But he said 40 percent of the district party members did not
bother to take part in elections to the congress, apparently out of
apathy.
   ``For me, nothing has been explained, nothing is happening, just
as we predicted,'' said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, a leader of the
Democratic Platform reform group. Group members decided to quit the
party and ask for a share of its assets after the congress.
   The modest new ideas presented at the congress have been shot
down.
   Gorbachev lost a bid to rename the party leader's post chairman
rather than general secretary, and add two deputies. He said it was
more likely that the congress would add one deputy.
   He also wanted to expand the Politburo in a move that would tend
to diffuse power, but he said it was likely the body would remain
as it is.
   Several Politburo members said they would step down, and party
leaders said 80 percent to 90 percent of the members of the
policy-making Central Committee might be changed.
   It was unclear whether that would make much of a difference.
Gorbachev already has replaced most of the Politburo and retired
many old members of the Central Committee with little effect.
   Gorbachev's position as party leader was secure. Despite a
barrage of criticism, neither traditionalists nor reformers could
find another acceptable candidate.
   When delegates showed a burst of independence, unthinkable in
previous congresses, by declaring that they would give each
Politburo member a separate evaluation, Gorbachev quickly cowed
them with a warning they would split the party.
   For those watching from the outside, it hardly mattered.
   ``I don't think there's any point to struggle with the Soviet
Communist Party,'' said reform-minded historian Yuri Afanasiev, who
quit the party two months before the congress. ``It is leaving the
stage, it is simply falling apart.''

   Tens of thousands of African
National Congress supporters marched in cities across the country
Saturday to protest black factional fighting in Natal Province that
has claimed thousands of lives.
   Official permission was granted for about 20 peace marches
planned by the ANC, and its allies, the Congress of South African
Trade Unions and the United Democratic Front, to mark the end of a
week of national protest against the violence. Petitions protesting
the violence were presented to authorities at various police
stations throughout the country.
   About 80,000 protesters staged a peaceful march through the
streets in the Eastern Cape province city of Port Elizabeth. The
high turnout was attributed to the region being a traditional ANC
stronghold.
   There were no incidents despite a heavy police and army presence
and the sealing off of some roads with barbed wire.
   The march was led by recently returned ANC exile Thobile Mhlahlo
and former police lieutenant Gregory Rockman, who last year exposed
incidents of police brutality.
   A memorandum delivered to police read: ``This is not
black-on-black violence, it's also neither faction fighting, but
apartheid war.'' President F.W. de Klerk was urged to stop the
violence.
   About 12,000 people marched through the Natal capital, Durban.
Protesters carried huge cloth banners that read ``Stop the
apartheid war, defend Natal.''
   They presented a memo to the local police commander, Col. Kobus
Le Roux.
   The Johannesburg march was led by ANC internal leader Walter
Sisulu, who was released in October after 25 years in jail. He led
about 2,000 protesters to police headquarters, John Voster Square.
   Sisulu and three senior activists presented a nine-page memo to
police protesting the ``terrible carnage taking place in Natal.''
   ``The government has to do something positive to bring peace in
that region,'' Sisulu said after delivering the petition.
   About 500 protesters marched through Pretoria to deliver their
petition to police.
   Authorities refused applications for marches in five towns which
have been the scenes of racial conflict and white right-wing
activity in recent months.
   About 800 security force members were deployed in Vereeniging,
one of the five towns, to ensure a planned march did not go ahead.
   The independent South African Press Association said police
stopped 5,000 black youths from marching. They then gathered at the
town's black township, Sebokeng, where several blacks were killed
by police during a protest March 26.
   Sebokeng's police commander, Col. Paddy Mazibuko, said that
since the march was thwarted, the crowd had gathered in the
township to attend the funeral of two local activists. March
organizers confirmed this.
   The weeklong protest was aimed at drawing attention to four
years of conflict in Natal between supporters of the ANC and
Inkatha, a conservative Zulu party. More than 4,000 people have
died in the violence, which the ANC claims is caused by Inkatha.
   De Klerk lifted most of the country's state of emergency last
month but kept it in Natal because of the violence in the region.
   The ANC claims the government has not taken firm steps to stop
the fighting. It has demanded that the government end the state of
emergency in Natal and disband the police force of the Kwazulu
homeland. Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi heads the homeland.
   Organizers of the protest said there could be no political
settlement in South Africa until the Natal violence ended. They
said the Natal crisis was an obstacle to a negotiated settlement to
end white-minority rule.
   The ANC and the government have begun a process of talks which
they hope will lead to a peaceful end to apartheid. Both sides have
identified various obstacles which they want removed before
negotiations can begin.

   President Bush cabled Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
reaffirm support for the Soviet leader's economic reforms while
flying to the Texas summit he's hosting for his counterparts from
major industrialized nations.
   Chief presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
sent Gorbachev the message from Air Force One, his executive jet,
as he was flying to Houston from the London NATO summit Friday
night.
   Fitzwater revealed the communication from Bush to Gorbachev
while briefing reporters today on meeting Bush held here with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Bush expressed his support
for Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or economic restructuring,
the spokesman said. Fitzwater said that Bush gave his personal
reflections with ``a little personal emphasis'' on just-concluded
NATO meeting, the spokesman said.
   Bush ``was very pleased with the reaction of the Soviet Union to
the summit,'' Fitzwater said, citing the favorable comments issued
by Soviet officials. Gorbachev had said Friday he was anxious to
accept NATO's offer to address a future meeting of the Western
alliance.
   Bush had told reporters on the flight that he received a recent
communique from Gorbachev. While he refused to disclose its
contents, there was speculation that it was similar to a recent
letter Gorbachev wrote to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
appealing for Western aid.
   On the question of possible Western aid to the Soviets,
Fitzwater said it would undoubtedly be raised at the Houston
economic summit and said ``there are a lot of things they can
consider short of direct aid.''
   Fitzwater also said the United states was ``willing to discuss
the matter'' of bilateral aid by other countries to China, which is
still under economic sanctions from many countries.
   Bush started his bilateral session with Kaifu by indicating the
United States wouldl acquiesce to Japan's proceeding with its plan
to give economic assistance to Beijing.
   Japan ``is a sovereign nation,'' the president told reporters.
``They can make up their own minds on a lot of questions.'' Bush
had been asked whether he would try to dissuade Kaifu from
proceeding with the loan package.
   ``They work very cooperatively with the United States, but
sometimes they have interests that predominate,'' Bush added.
   While the United States still retains sanctions against Bejing,
in the wake of last year's bloody crackdown on Chinese
pro-democracy demonstrations, the Bush administration has chipped
away at those sanctions and said that the United States does not
want to isolate such a geopolitically important country.
   Bush and Kaifu got a jump on the seven-nation economic summit,
which officially begins Monday, with their meeting scheduled today.
Most of the other participants were due early too, for some
Texas-style social preliminaries.
   The leaders of the world's richest democracies faced a full,
likely contentious agenda, ranging from whether to provide the
Soviet Union with cash and other direct assistance to how to
resolve a family trade fight involving billions of dollars in
agricultural subsidies.
   Other countries participating in the 16th annual economic summit
were Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
   This was the first time in seven years that one of these
gatherings has been in the United States. And Houston, picked by
the president because it is his adopted hometown, was going all out
to prove that the city has made a dramatic turnaround since hitting
bottom during the oil price bust in the last decade.
   Before the formal summit talks began, Bush was playing host to
the other summit leaders at a combination rodeo, barbecue and
performance by the Grand Ole Opry on Sunday.
   Flags of the summit countries were flying everywhere, and the
city gleamed in the wake of an effort by thousands of volunteers to
clear it of trash and debris. The actual meetings between the
leaders will be held at Rice University, a 4,000-student private
university located about five miles from downtown.
   All of the talks were expected to involve a search for consensus
on the differences separating the countries. And some of those
threatened to fray, rather than bind, their connections.
   On Soviet aid, the United States, Britain and Japan found
themselves aligned in opposition to a proposal being pushed by West
Germany and France to provide a $15 billion assistance package to
bail out President Mikhail Gorbachev's floundering economic reforms.
   Bush on Friday continued to insist that such aid would
inappropriate at a time when the Soviet Union is still spending
huge sums on its military and also providing $5 billion annually to
support Cuba.
   However, the president seemed to open the door to a possible
compromise with Western allies when he suggested that it might be
possible for the United States to extend trade credits. Such
credits could take the form of loan guarantees provided to the
Soviets on their purchases of American farm and industrial products.

<TEXT>
   The president of the French branch of the Church of
Scientology and five colleagues have been arrested in a probe of
alleged fraud and illegal practice of medicine, court and church
officials said Saturday.
   The president, Daniele Gounord, was arrested Friday in Paris
along with the church's treasurer and the head of a church
foundation. They were placed under court supervision, but not jailed
   Three officials of the Scientologists' branch in Lyon were
arrested there in the past 10 days _ the local president, treasurer
and secretary. They have been charged with complicity in fraud and
illegal practice of medicine.
   All six are to appear in court in Lyon, where an order for
Friday's arrests was issued by Judge Georges Fenech.
   The arrests stem from a police investigation into the suicide of
Patrick Vick, a Church of Scientology member in Lyon who jumped out
of a 12th floor window in 1988. Investigators found medicine in his
house allegedly provided to him by the church in violation of a
regulation requiring a doctor's prescription.
   Vick's widow filed a complaint in court against the
Scientologists' branch in Lyon.
   The church issued a communique denouncing the arrests as ``a
serious attack on individual freedom of religion.''
   The Church of Scientology was founded in the United States in
1950 by L. Ron Hubbard.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev turned defeat into victory
Saturday by persuading the Communist Party congress to drop plans
to evaluate each member of the ruling Politburo, warning that such
action would ``bury the party.''
   Delegates to the 28th Communist Party congress have criticized
many of the 12 Politburo members and wanted to give the thumbs-up
or thumbs-down on each of them.
   The delegates voted 2,557 to 1,393 for such a chance before
their afternoon break. But Gorbachev later warned: ``If you want to
bury the party, to split the party, then continue on this way. ...
Think, think hard, think hard.''
   The ire of the 59-year-old Soviet leader, who has skillfully
consolidated his position at the congress, prompted the delegates
to vote 2,495 to 1,515 to reverse themselves.
   In his argument, Gorbachev read a note from the northern Russian
city of Arkhangelsk that said: ``There is no need to evaluate each
Politburo member. The Politburo, according to the rules, is an
organ of the leadership, and the leadership is collective.''
   Instead, the congress agreed to evaluate the policy-making
Central Committee, and within it the Politburo, as a whole.
   Politburo member Vladimir Ivashko later read a draft of a
resolution on the Central Committee that is to be voted on this
week.
   The draft praises the committee for major changes enacted since
the last congress in 1986, the move toward democracy and free
elections. But it blames the party for failing to carry out party
policy, leading to social and economic difficulties.
   The congress broke a decades-old tradition last week by
requiring each Politburo member to account for his work and answer
written questions from the nearly 4,700 delegates.
   Inna Dementyeva, a Moscow delegate, said the vote on personal
evaluations would have gone too far.
   ``Our Russian thirst for blood is showing,'' she said. ``It's
stupid and ugly and inhuman.''
   Delegates interviewed in the lobby of the Kremlin Palace of
Congresses said that allowing the mostly conservative congress to
vote on individual leaders also might have embarrassed Gorbachev
and his allies and benefited such conservative critics as Yegor K.
Ligachev.
   Some also said they had expected at least half the Politburo to
get the thumbs down, particulary ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev
and international policy head Alexander N. Yakovlev.
   ``Collective responsibility is no responsibility,'' said a
Byelorussian delegate who identified himself only as Alexander.
``And there should be a full renewal of the leadership.''
   Several Politburo members responded to the written questions
they received from delegates, and Medvedev said he had been accused
of letting party ideology crumble and discipline among Soviet
journalists break down.
   He responded that the party had shed ``fossilized thinking and
dogmatism'' and that journalists should be governed by law and
their ``party and civic conscience.''
   Yakovlev, one of Gorbachev's closest advisers, said he had been
accused of ``connivance to separatism in the Baltic republics'' and
the ``loss of Eastern Europe.''
   He responded that he had spoken out against separatism and
nationalism and that the people of Eastern Europe were the ones who
rejected the Communist Party.
   Ligachev also took the floor and said he opposed reunification
of the German states because the West was ``absorbing'' the East.
   He criticized the concept of private property and plans to
convert the Soviet Union to a market-oriented economy, saying
proponents of ``free market relations'' should become the first
Soviet unemployed.
   Ligachev also opposed political reforms that would diminish the
party's role in society and government. ``I don't see another force
other than the party which could bring progress to our country,''
he said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze defended Soviet policy
on German unity, saying Moscow's interests could best be served
through international negotiations rather than attempts to block
the merger.
   He received only mild applause, but drew strong support when he
reminded the congress that the republic of Georgia, under his
leadership, started to fight corruption in the party.
   Although Gorbachev preserved the facade of collective leadership
by defeating individual evaluations of Politburo members, major
personnel changes are expected at the congress. Yakovlev, Medvedev
and Lev Zaikov have indicated they plan to step down from the
Politburo.
   The congress will choose a new Central Committee, which in turn
will select a new Politburo.
   Delegates said there did not appear to be any serious challenge
to Gorbachev as party leader. Nominations for the post were delayed
until later this week.
   In a draft of party rules, the congress will elect a new party
leader _ the general secretary _ and create a new post of deputy
general secretary, also to be elected by the congress.
   Among the candidates mentioned for the No. 2. post are Ligachev,
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and
Pravda editor Ivan Frolov. But Gorbachev adviser Georgy
Shakhnazarov said he thought the deputy might turn out to be
``someone completely new.''

<HEAD>Officers May Use Stun Guns _ Only After They Get Stunned First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police here have been authorized to
use stun guns as an alternative to nightsticks, but there's a catch
_ any officer who wants to use the device has to get zapped first
to know what it's like.
   Forty Pompano Beach officers have signed up for a six-hour
course on the use of the electric weapon. The officers are
responsible for buying their own stun guns, which cost an average
of about $150.
   Getting zapped is the last part of the course, and on Friday
officers of all sizes yelled and crumpled helplessly to the ground
when they were touched with the stun gun and the electricity hit
their muscles.
   ``It's really a convincer,'' officer Bill Butler said after he
experienced it. ``It's like something really biting into you.''
   ``It hurt. A lot,'' said officer Kathy Konieczka.
   After being zapped, officers said they would not hesitate to use
the guns as a last resort in place of physical restraint.
   ``A nightstick will injure someone,'' Butler said.
   Officer Ken Holland, who is in charge of the training program,
said the stun guns are completely safe. But there are precautions _
an officer must stop the current as soon as the subject falls and
they are forbidden to place the device on a person's head, face or
groin.
   Twelve officers carried the guns during a pilot program that
began in February. The weapons have been used 12 times with no
complaints and no injuries, Holland said.
   ``All were violent or potentially violent situations,'' he said.
``We had no allegations of abuse or use of excessive force.''
   The weapon's shock is supposed to do nothing more than render a
person defenseless for a few seconds.
   ``It has nothing to do with your brain or heart,'' police
spokeswoman Sandra King said. ``Your muscles will go limp for a
couple of seconds.''
   And use of the guns will be strictly monitored.
   ``Any time the officer takes it out or shows it to someone, they
have to fill out a long form explaining why they pulled it out,''
King said.

<HEAD>Prices Soar in East German After Economic Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katrin Matthes got out of bed before dawn
Saturday, left her home in southern East Germany and drove three
hours to West Berlin to find food she can afford.
   She was among hundreds of East Germans crowding into a West
Berlin store to buy meat, butter and milk that, paradoxically, are
suddenly cheaper in the wealthy West than the struggling East.
   The 17-year-old factory worker from Dresden paid 102 German
marks ($60) for groceries she said will feed her and three Dresden
families in the next few days.
   ``It would have cost 300 marks ($180) in East Germany,'' she
said.
   The stunning rise in prices just days after the German states
merged their economies has created a scandal in both countries and
sent droves of East Germans into Western grocery stores.
   After the two nations unified their economies on July 1, East
German stores began filling their shelves with Western products.
   But because East German stores face substantially less
competition, their prices are not only three or four times higher
than before economic unification, but also often higher than the
same goods sold in West Germany.
   German media reported a flood of East Germans heading West on
Saturday, the first shopping weekend since the economic merger and
the first Saturday of the month, when West German stores by law are
allowed to stay open longer.
   At one store, a pound of salt was selling for 21 cents, while in
East Berlin it was selling for 72 cents.
   Anna Neitman, a 22-year-old student from the southern city of
Leipzig, said the East German stores that were once state-owned and
sold food at government-set prices are now taking advantage of
their captive markets.
   ``We have to buy what they sell, unless we come here,'' she said
as she stood outside a West Berlin supermarket.
   Andries Kurjo, a West Berlin economist and a leading expert on
the East German agricultural economy, said consumers will have to
rebel to bring prices down.
   ``The consumers won't accept these high prices,'' he said.
``They have to pay for bread that is four times higher. They can
get the same things in some West German shops much cheaper.''
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany criticized the
price increases last week, and government officials asked consumers
to begin reporting instances of price gouging.
   The East German Parliament on Friday passed a law intended to
break up the two large grocery chains that hold a virtual monopoly
in the East German food business.
   The law would allow communities to sell the formerly state-owned
stores in their towns.
   Kurjo, however, said he expected few takers. ``Who has the money
to buy them? Who has the knowledge to run such a store?'' he said.
   The two grocery store chains, HO and Konsum, made deals with
eight large West German companies in March to sell Western
products, which now dominate the marketplace.
   Konsum, in a statement on Saturday, denied that it was a
monopoly and sharply criticized the law passed Friday by Parliament.
   The chain's board said the property rights of the company are
``protected and inviolable,'' according to a statement carried by
the East German news agency ADN.
   It said that 1,500 stores were being run by private proprietors
and that there were applications to run 600 others. The statement
claimed the chain is not a monopoly because it is not owned by its
wholesalers.
   Kurjo, however, said the chains were monopolies because they
dominate their markets with little competition, and the products
they sell are strictly regulated by their agreements with the West
German firms.
   ``HO and Konsum were glad to get into these agreements, but it
has led to this monopoly,'' Kurjo said.
   ``Now they are under the control of the Western food chains.
There is no real competition. The lack of competition is so bad
that (East German) producers are not allowed to offer their
products in these shops,'' he said.
   Many stores in smaller towns sell East German agricultural
products, but many of those prices also are higher because the
government has eliminated the state subsidies of the old Communist
regime, he said.
   Kurjo said consumers can bring prices down only by refusing to
buy outrageously priced products buying in West German stores that
sell cheaper goods, because they face more competition.
   He said East German farmers must be willing to find new ways to
market, distribute and sell their products if they want to survive.
   Retailers learned quickly, however, and their grasp of the laws
of supply and demand drew some sour comment from German media.
   ``With bravura the former staunchly socialist Konsum and HO have
sprung into the market economy _ as capitalistic as the greediest
capitalist,'' East Germany's ADN news agency said.

   Creditors of Saudi financier Adnan
Khashoggi's bankrupt Utah holding company were sent $10 million in
payments the same day he was acquitted on obstruction of justice
and fraud charges.
   The 53-year-old arms merchant was cleared by a New York jury
Monday of charges that he helped former Philippines president
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, conceal the purchase of four
New York City buildings.
   Coincidentally, that same day, partial payments were mailed to
creditors of Triad America. The Salt Lake City-based Triad America,
the holding company for Khashoggi's U.S. interests, declared
bankruptcy in 1987 after a string of failed real estate ventures.
   Khashoggi's trial meant nothing to the Triad America case, said
estate attorney Danny Kelly.
   Two years ago, Khashoggi paid the Triad estate $32 million,
which forms the bulk of money now being disbursed to creditors.
   The $10 million constitutes the largest single distribution from
the estate, bringing the total amount paid to unsecured creditors
to $18 million, said Triad trustee R. Todd Neilson. That amounts to
about 43 percent of their total recognied claims, he said.
   ``I hope we can ultimately distribute another $15 million,'' he
said. He plans a fourth distribution this year and a final one
sometime in 1991.
   The estate's largest creditor is Sheraton, which has received
about $7 million so far. Last week's payment included $3,147,000 to
the hotel company, while the smallest creditor, Mount Olympus
Water, received $3.

difference between London, site of the NATO summit, and this Texas
city, host to the seven-nation economic summit.
   For one thing, there is the weather. Temperatures were in the
60s on Friday in London as the world leaders ended their NATO
session. Here in Houston, it was a scorching 93 degrees with
humidity readings above 80 percent.
   Houston is taking the weather in stride _ and hoping its guests

   President Bush and his summit partners may spend a fair amount
of time haggling over a sticky economic problem that most Americans
have never heard about.
   It's a fight over farm subsidies as part of an effort to reform
the global trading system.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the Latin American
country where they were launched in 1986, have been going on mostly
unnoticed for the past four years in Geneva.
   Hoping to raise the profile of the issue, the staff of U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hill is handing out buttons at the
summit sporting the slogan, ``The Uruguay Round is not a dance.''

   Former paratrooper Chuck Beckman watched and
remembered Saturday as a group of modern Army Airborne troops
marched past him in combat dress, their backs straight, jaws out
and berets cocked just so.
   ``We were tough,'' he said, ``but I don't know if we were that
tough.''
   Beckman, from Southern Pines, N.C., was one of several thousand
former paratroopers who gathered in Washington over the weekend and
held a parade Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of America's
Airborne military.
   Former paratroopers from World War II, like Beckman, as well as
those from the Korean and Vietnam wars, and the periods in between
and since, also took part.
   Some marched, and others chose to watch. Alex Madsen, 69, of
Solvang, Calif., watched from a park bench with a friend from the
old days, H.G. Bennett, 73, of Sun City, Ariz.
   ``You know, we've spent a lot of money just to come to a bull
session,'' Madsen joked.
   Both were members of the Army's 507th Airborne Regiment,
headquarters company, and both parachuted into Normandy on D-Day,
1944. They also parachuted at the Rhine crossing in 1945, and
Madsen wore his paratrooper's wings bearing a pair of stars, one
for each combat drop.
   There were veterans from all periods, but the World War II
crowd, the original paratroopers, were most in evidence. They
marched together with what was left of their old regiments.
   The brass also was there. Retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland,
who was U.S. military commander in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968,
received the marching men's salutes at a reviewing stand.
   Only 13 gray-haired men marched with the original 501st
parachute batallion, which was formed in 1940. In other groups,
some rode in wheelchairs or walked on crutches, and some wore what
they could of their old uniforms.
   ``It's air conditioned,'' one marching veteran said to the
crowd, tugging at the jacket that no longer met in the middle.
   The all-black 555th Battalion also marched.
   Charles McCloed, 63, of Philadelphia, became a member of the
555th in 1946, volunteering after a year in Germany with Army
intelligence. He served until 1950, and recalled when the order to
integrate came in 1948. The battalion was made a part of another
unit.
   ``It was just on paper,'' he said. ``We stayed in the same
place, at Fort Bragg. We just changed the patches on our
shoulders.''
   Paratroopers have always been a close-knit group, in a way that
transcended boundaries of race or rank, he said. ``I don't care
whether it's a general or a private, today we all just say, `How
you doing, trooper,''' McCloed said.
   There were old Jeeps, trucks, even a restored staff car _ all
privately owned.
   Tony Lambros, a Vietnam veteran from Fallston, Md., drove a Jeep
nearly as storied as the old veterans he carried in it. The Jeep
landed in the invasion in 1944 and carries documentation of its
stops through Belgium and France, where it stayed until it was sold
as salvage more than 15 years after the war, he said.
   The world they fought in has been changing rapidly, these
veterans of the war in Europe acknowledged. But there were few
regrets or sounds of alarm about the unification of Germany or the
easing of East-West tensions.
   ``I welcome it,'' Madsen said. ``Let's hope that the day will
come when it's no longer necessary to have such a vast amount of
money tied up in the military.''

   The Louisiana Senate today sustained
Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto of the nation's toughest state abortion
bill, coming three votes shy of the number needed to override.
   However, the issue was not dead and a second vote on the issue
is likely to be taken Sunday. Under legislative rules, the fact
that a simple majority was in favor meant that backers can try for
another vote on the issue Sunday.
   The vote in favor of the override was 23-16. It takes 26 votes
in the Senate to override a veto.
   The House voted to override Friday.
   The senators debated as chanting abortion foes, and a few
pro-choice demonstrators, gathered in the balcony, in the Capitol
rotunda and outside. At one point, state troopers carried a
screaming woman from the balcony after she interrupted the speech
of an abortion opponent.
   Had the override succeeded, it would have been the first time
this century that Louisiana legislators had overruled a governor's
veto.
   Roemer vetoed the measure Friday because it made no exceptions
for victims of rape or incest.
   ``It is not just the people outside this building or in this
state watching what we do,'' said override backer Sen. Mike Cross,
a co-author of the bill. ``People all over the country, all over
the world, are watching us. I hope you will say no, that you will
not continue to do away with future generations.''
   Sen. Sydney Nelson, who wanted the veto upheld, said that a bill
that did not include exceptions for rape and incest is inhumane.
``I'm not for abortion on demand or for gender selection or birth
control,'' he said. ``But for me as a man, to say to the women of
this state, that we don't care how you get pregnant, you must carry
to term, I just can't do that.''
   The deadline for action is midnight Monday, when the Legislature
is due to adjourn.
   Late Friday, the state House voted 73-31 to reject Roemer's
veto. It was the first time this century that even one chamber of
the Legislature had overridden a veto in Louisiana.
   But the House, unlike the Senate, had passed the bill by more
than a two-thirds majority in the first place.
   As the Senate resumed work this morning, most of the 34-story
Capitol building was sealed off to the public in order to better
control demonstrators, said Senate President Samuel Nunez.
Demonstrators were being allowed in the rotunda area and the
upstairs gallery of the Senate.
   In the rotunda, some 500 opponents chanted ``Override!
Override!'' and waved anti-abortion bumper stickers. Scattered
among the crowd were small groups of abortion rights demonstrators.
   One of the few abortion rights demonstrators in the gallery
during today's debate interrupted Sen. John Saunders' anti-abortion
speech when he told the Senate that none of the hundreds of
demonstrators outside the chamber was carrying signs in support of
the veto.
   ``Yes there is! Yes there is!'' the woman screamed. Two state
troopers carried her out of the balcony as she yelled ``Let me
go!'' A few seconds of stunned silence followed before Saunders
said ``Well, there is one.''
   The woman, identified as Karen Anklam, 26, of New Orleans, was
not arrested. She was ordered out of the Capitol and allowed to
listen to the Senate debate on loudspeakers set up outside.
   Before the Senate quit for the day Friday night, Sen. Allen
Bares, a supporter of the bill, acknowledged to his colleagues that
abortion foes do not have the necessary two-thirds majority of the
Senate.
   Proponents of an override were already at work, buying full-page
ads in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles newspapers
featuring a message from Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who sent a
telegram to Roemer in favor of the bill.
   The bill passed two weeks ago would allow abortion only to save
the life of the mother. Doctors could get up to 10 years in prison
for performing an abortion.
   The bill was written to challenge the 1973 Supreme Court
decision Roe vs. Wade that recognized the right to an abortion.
   The governor's forces wanted an immediate vote to sustain his
veto, but Bares got his colleagues to adjourn.
   ``This issue is too important to handle this late at night
without a hearing,'' Bares said.
   Robin Rothrock, leader of an abortion rights coalition, had said
earlier she was confident the Senate would sustain Roemer's veto.
   ``In the Senate we believe that we still have the 15''
legislators who voted against the measure when it passed the Senate
with 24 votes, she said.
   In his veto message, Roemer responded to charges he changed his
position on abortion since he was a member of Congress, running for
governor, in 1987.
   ``As a member of Congress, I consistently voted to curb abortion
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus,'' Roemer wrote. ``I
initially voted for the exception to save the life of a mother, but
over the years of struggling with this issue I became acutely aware
of the need to except those instances where conception occurred
because of rape or incest.
   ``Women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences
of these traumatic, illegal acts.''
   The bill's author, Rep. Woody Jenkins, cited statistics in a
House debate that out of more than 15,000 abortions performed in
Louisiana in 1987, only one was doe to end a pregnancy that
resulted from rape.
   ``He's for killing 15,000 unborn children a year in Louisiana
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also
killed,'' said Jenkins.

<HEAD>Walesa and Mazowiecki Set Aside Their Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki declared a political truce after a
private, five-hour meeting Saturday, pledging to cooperate ``for
the good of our country.''
   A brief statement issued by the PAP news agency after the
meeting indicated that the leaders, at odds over the pace of
political and economic changes, decided that their disagreements
must not lead to social unrest.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Bronislaw Dabrowski was host of the
unannounced meeting, which was held at an undisclosed location near
Warsaw.
   It took place as thousands of farmers who feel their business is
being hurt by Poland's economic policies demonstrated outside the
main government building in the capital, Warsaw.
   ``Differences in political views that appear in our country, as
well as different interests of various social groups, should not
destabilize the situation in Poland,'' the leaders' communique said.
   ``The condition of deep reconstruction in our country is the
preservation of social peace and law-abidingness.''
   According to the communique, Walesa and Mazowiecki promised
``cooperation for the good of our country and further progress in
democratization.''
   The statement didn't say what subjects Mazowiecki and Walesa
discussed, or whether they made any deals for the other's
cooperation.
   Mazowiecki has recently drawn sharp criticism from farmers and
the faction of Solidarity loyal to Walesa.
   In a bid to deflect the attacks, the prime minister ousted three
of the four Communists in his Cabinet on Friday and caved in to
Walesa's demands for elections earlier than next year.
   He also appealed to the public, and especially farmers, for
patience and self-restraint.
   But the moves did not satisfy the farmers demanding guaranteed
minimum prices for their produce and threatening a nationwide road
blockade on Monday.
   About 3,000 farmers marched through central Warsaw and then took
up a vigil outside the Council of Ministers building for most of
the day Saturday. Inside, negotiations between farmers unions and
senior government officials lasted into the evening before breaking
up with no results.
   At least one leader of the protesters said they might try to
bring down the government. ``It is not our goal but it may be
necessary,'' said Bogdan Wlodarczyk, vice-chairman of the farmers'
strike committee.
   ``If I know that in a few weeks I will not have any money to buy
something for my child, then nothing will restrain me,'' he said.
   Walesa for months has been urging Mazowiecki to accelerate
political and economic changes, particularly by removing Communists
from positions of authority in government and the economy,
beginning widescale privatization of state industries, and holding
early elections to parliament and the presidency.
   Walesa himself is considered the most likely candidate for
president to remove President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the longtime
Communist leader who has held the office for one year.
   Walesa's criticisms have been accompanied by warnings to the
Solidarity-led government he helped install that it was losing
touch with the common people who are Solidarity's base.
   One example is the farmers, who claim they cannot survive under
the government's shock economic program. The program has resulted
in falling consumer demand, leading to a glut of produce and low
prices for farmers.
   A national farm protest committee said all major highways in
Poland will be blocked for one hour on Monday, from noon to 1 p.m.

<TEXT>
   A ``60 Minutes'' show on Bridgeport
painted such a bleak picture of the city that hundreds of people
wrote to offer the new mayor some free, if not always sound, advice
on how to turn things around.
   Some even sent cash after the piece on Bridgeport aired this
spring, including a man who wrote a check for $2.50 in appreciation
of a General Electric toaster manufactured in Bridgeport many years
ago.
   ``It's still working fine,'' the man wrote.
   Two people from California, both impressed with Mayor Mary
Moran's portrayal as the anti-politician, sent $100 each. Total
donations topped $300.
   ``We were appalled and heartsick at the monumental task you
face,'' one family wrote.
   CBS depicted Bridgeport, a city of 142,000 about 55 miles
northeast of New York City, as a once-major industrial center on
the ``verge of economic collapse.'' Viewers were shown shot after
shot of blighted housing and abandoned factories in a city
described as ``depressed, discouraged and broke.''
   The letter-writers ranged from a Wall Street investment firm to
inventors with sometimes dubious claims about the moneymaking
potential of their products and consultants seeking to be added to
the city's payroll. A chain letter that reached City Hall _ and
never left _ promised good fortune if the letter was sent on. It
warned of disastrous consequences if it was broken.
   A man from Ohio was not pleased when he saw the mayor cooking
breakfast for her husband on ``60 Minutes.'' He told her she could
not be both a housewife and mayor of a city with so many problems.
   ``Let your husband learn how to fix his own breakfast, a simple
task millions of males already do for themselves,'' he said, before
going on to suggest she should report for work at 5 a.m.
   Hong Kong millionaires seeking to leave the British crown colony
before it comes under Chinese rule would answer to the city's
economic difficulties, several writers said.
   ``If these men were offered a haven in Bridgeport, by buying up
some old, rundown sewing or other factories, and turning them into
modern enterprises, you couldn't fail!'' a woman writing from New
York enthused.
   In response to the show, a $1,000 prize is being offered to the
person who can produce the best videotape showing Bridgeport's good
side. The contest, which ends July 30, is called ``6 Minutes:
Bridgeport Reels Back.''
   The top entries are to be shown next month at a downtown movie
house that the owner has dubbed the ``ghost theater'' because of
the ``60 Minutes'' claim that Bridgeport has no cinema. The cinema
once featured X-rated films but is now a family theater.
   Frank Borres, director of communications for the Bank Mart and
one of the contest organizers, said the ``60 Minutes'' segment on
Bridgeport was ``pretty scary because it was real.''
   Moran, a Republican who upset two-term incumbent Thomas Bucci
last November in her first bid for major public office, said she's
grateful for the letters.
   ``I think it's wonderful that people would sit down and say,
`This is what you could do,' whether it was good advice or not,''
she said.
   Moran says the ``60 Minutes'' piece fell short in not showing
the good things Bridgeport has to offer _ ``the reasons why I would
want to become mayor.''
   She cited the city's zoo, museums, parks, symphony, ballet, P.T.
Barnum Museum, and proximity to New York as some of Bridgeport's
many attributes.
   The Legislature imposed state review of Bridgeport's finances in
1988 as a condition for guaranteeing a $35 million loan needed to
cover accumulated deficits. With no real growth in the tax base for
five years now, the city had to raise taxes 5 percent this year and
eliminate about 170 jobs through layoffs and attrition.
   Homicides, meanwhile, have been occurring at a record-shattering
pace. There have already been 38 homicides here this year, compared
with 42 for all of last year, a police official said.
   Moran says the best thing to come out of the controversy is that
``it made Bridgeporters talk positively about their city for the
first time in a long time.''
   ``People said, `How dare they attack us.' It was like when
someone attacks your child,'' Moran said.

<HEAD>Palestinian Killed During Prison Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli army guards on Saturday shot and killed
an 18-year-old Palestinian who tried to escape a prison in the
occupied West Bank five days before his trial was to begin, the
military said.
   An army official said guards at the Ofer prison near the town of
Ramallah noticed the inmate running toward the prison fence shortly
after midnight.
   Following established guidelines, the guards shouted a warning,
fired warning shots in the air, then shot at the prisoner's legs,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The prisoner ignored the warnings and climbed over the fence.
Outside Ofer, the procedure was repeated and when the inmate
refused to stop, the guards opened fire at his body and wounded
him, the official said.
   The military said the prisoner, Tzabari Mansour Abdallah Abed
Rabbo, died after arriving at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. The
case is under investigation by prison commanders and military
police, the army said.
   Abed Rabbo, of El-Jib village near Ramallah, was arrested in
January on suspicion of participating in protests and
stone-throwings, and his trial was scheduled to start July 12 at
the Ramallah military court, the army said.
   He was the 723rd Palestinian to die of Israeli gunfire in the
nearly 31-month-old, anti-Israeli uprising in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
   An additional 232 Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs
on suspicion of assisting Israeli authorities during the rebellion,
and 45 Israelis also have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Magazine: NASA Paid Bonuses to Builders of Troubled Space
Telescope</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government overpaid as much as $1 million
in bonuses to two Hubble Space Telescope contractors for their cost
control efforts on the device, which has been a major headache for
NASA, a magazine reported Saturday.
   Congressional Quarterly reported in its July 7 edition that the
overpayments occurred at the same time costs for the expensive
telescope were rising dramatically. The original cost estimate for
the Hubble was $678 million, but it's final price tag was more than
$1.5 billion.
   The magazine said information about the bonus was contained in a
July 1989 audit report by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's office of inspector general. The material was
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
   The Hubble was launched April 24 and NASA announced June 27 that
its two main mirrors would not focus properly. A manufacturing
error was suspected.
   Congressional Quarterly said the inspector general's report
accused NASA management of ``not properly considering all ... cost
overruns'' in figuring cost control bonuses paid to Hubble's two
principal contractors, Lockheed Corp. and Perkin-Elmer Corp., now
Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which built the telescope's
mirrors.
   Lockheed received $14.4 million in bonuses and Hughes-Danbury
was paid $6 million in bonuses through April 30, 1987, the report
said. If NASA had fully considered the cost overruns, the bonuses
may have been reduced by as much as $1 million, it said.
   Attempts Saturday to reach either of the contractors and NASA
were unsuccessful. But Congressional Quarterly quoted project
managers at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., as
disagreeing with the audit conclusions while promising to implement
many of the report's recommendations.
   A Lockheed official also took issue with the report.
   ``If this thing followed its normal course they probably didn't
pay us enough,'' H. Hollister Cantus, vice president of Lockheed's
space group, told the magazine.
   ``If you're going to do business with NASA, don't expect to make
a large profit. NASA is a damned tough taskmaster,'' he added.
   The magazine said Hughes-Danbury declined to comment.
   A NASA lawyer told Congressional Quarterly that the agency did
``withhold a significant amount of award fees'' that could have
gone to the contractors. Francis P. LaRocca Jr. said NASA declined
to give the companies about $6.6 million of an available $27
million.

<HEAD>Doe's Government Announces Cease-Fire, But Fighting Continues</HEAD>

reporters in Monrovia. Associated Press correspondent Michelle Faul
was among them.

<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe's shattered
government announced a cease-fire on a makeshift radio station but
sporadic fighting between soldiers and rebels continued Saturday on
the fringe of the besieged capital.
   A radio broadcast Friday night said a cease-fire had been
reached and it appealed to shops to open and government workers to
return to their offices.
   Nearly everything remained closed, however.
   Monrovians have been beset by looting government troops, rebels
bent on tribal reprisals and severe food shortages, and deprived of
running water and electricity for more than a week. Many said they
wanted to believe the cease-fire announcement but did not.
   There was no comment from the rebels, but they have said
previously that Doe must leave the country before they will accept
a truce.
   Led by former aide Charles Taylor, the rebels invaded from Ivory
Coast on Dec. 24 to overthrow Doe's government, which they accuse
of corruption, tribalism and brutal suppression of opposition.
   Liberian and diplomatic sources said the cease-fire was
announced from a makeshift radio station at Doe's fortified
beachside executive mansion. The radio went off the air after the
announcement.
   Few people heard the broadcast because the main state radio
station on the eastern outskirts of Monrovia stopped broadcasting
Tuesday as rebels advanced on the city.
   The rebels have been unable to make good on their claim that
they could take Monrovia within 12 hours.
   Meanwhile, Doe has been deserted by most of his Cabinet
ministers, the two chief army commanders and dozens of other top
officials. Government troops appear demoralized and disorganized,
and many have abandoned their posts.
   Some soldiers fired U.S.-supplied M16 rifles into the air in
celebration when they heard the report of the cease-fire.
   Rebels attacked the city's port on Friday and the capital echoed
with the rumble of heavy artillery and the crackle of gunfire. The
fighting Saturday was sporadic and occurred on the city's western
and eastern outskirts.
   Relief workers said about 40 people, civilians and soldiers,
were treated for injuries at an emergency field hospital set up by
the European agency Doctors Without Borders at a Roman Catholic
hospital.
   Hundreds of people, fearing tribal reprisals by soldiers or
rebels, have been trying to get into already overcrowded refugee
compounds, some of which are protected by Swiss personnel of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Refugees said many people jumped a wall Friday night to join
them at the American Community School.
   Western diplomats said about 17,000 people had gathered for
safety at the compound of the U.S. government's ship-tracking
transmitter. The transmitter, one of only seven of its kind in the
world, fell behind rebel lines on Monday.
   Managers at the Omega station, just outside Monrovia, have
refused rebel demands that they hand over Krahns and Mandingos
among the refugees.
   Doe is of the Krahn tribe and Mandingos are accused of
supporting him and growing wealthy during his corrupt 10-year
administration.
   Creeks and wells in the city were crowded with people bathing or
collecting water for cooking and drinking. Health officials fear
outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne diseases.
   A supermarket, the first to open this week, let in shoppers two
or three at a time after they had lined up for more than an hour.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman denied a report Friday that the embassy
had supplied water to Doe's Israeli-built mansion. He said a water
tanker escorted by Marines had gone Friday to a creek near the
mansion to collect water for the embassy compound.
   The United States has offered to help Doe leave Liberia. He
reportedly has offered to resign on condition his safety and that
of his minority Krahn tribe is guaranteed.
   After the rebels invaded, Doe's forces killed hundreds of
civilian members of the Gio and Mano tribes, seen as the main
support base for the rebels. The rebels then sought revenge by
killing members of the Krahn tribe and the Mandingo people, who
have supported Doe.
   Rebel leader Taylor is a strong supporter of capitalism and he
has widespread support in Liberia. But the United States and other
governments have questioned his commitment to democracy and free
elections.

   Louisiana's Senate voted Saturday
against overriding Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto of what would have been
the nation's toughest state abortion law.
   The vote was 23 in favor of the override _ three short of the
two-thirds majority needed _ and 16 against. When the bill to make
abortion a criminal offense passed the Senate last month, it got 24
votes.
   The failure of the override attempt was not final, however.
Under legislative rules, the bill's backers get a second chance
Sunday because a simple majority was on their side. For the
override to pass, the Senate must act before the Legislature
adjourns at midnight Monday.
   ``We'll pray that we can change some minds,'' said Rep. Woody
Jenkins, author of the measure.
   The House had approved the override measure late Friday.
   Terri Bartlett, director of Planned Parenthood of Louisiana,
told her jubilant supporters that the battle wasn't over.
``Tomorrow's vote is as critical and as important as the one that
happened today,'' she said.
   After the vote, viewers quietly filed out of the gallery. In the
rotunda, pro-choice backers waved purple flowers and ribbons and
shouted: ``We won!'' Abortion opponents countered with the chant of
``We will win. We will win.''
   If the Senate voted to follow the House's lead and override, it
would be the first time this century that a legislature overrode a
Louisiana governor's veto.
   Since the legislative session began in April, Roemer had said he
opposed abortion on demand but would veto a measure that made no
exceptions for rape or incest. He did just that Friday.
   Supporters argued that exceptions would allow women to get
abortions by falsely claiming to have been raped.
   The bill provides a maximum 10-year prison term and $100,000
fine for people who perform abortions but no penalty for the woman
obtaining the abortion.
   Sen. Mike Cross, the Senate sponsor of the bill, warned that
failing to override the veto would mean legislators would have to
put up with continued intense, emotional lobbying going into next
year's elections.
   ``You think it's tough this year?'' said Cross. ``It's not going
to wait until next year at this time. It's going to be a long,
long, long year if we don't vote to override the governor's veto.''
   Supporters of the bill said it would provide the U.S. Supreme
Court with a vehicle to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision,
which made most abortions legal, because by outlawing abortion
outright the Louisiana bill forces the issue in the simplest
possible terms.
   Sen. Sydney Nelson argued that no woman should be forced to
continue a pregnancy if it results from rape or incest, or if there
is evidence the child will have birth defects. He also raised the
spectre of women resorting to dangerous back-alley abortions.
   ``Are we as 39 men to make a decision that so materially affects
the ladies of our state?'' asked Nelson. ``I say the governor's
veto is reasonable. The governor's veto should be sustained.''
   State police limited access to the Capitol to avoid noisy
demonstrations that might distract from debate.
   Demonstrators in and out of the Capitol were for the most part
orderly, but at one point during the debate state troopers carried
a screaming woman from the balcony of the Senate chamber.
   She interrupted Sen. John Saunders' anti-abortion speech when he
told the Senate that among the hundreds of demonstrators outside
the chamber there were no signs supporting the veto.
   ``Yes there is! Yes there is!'' the woman screamed. Two state
troopers carried her out of the balcony as she yelled ``Let me go!''
   The woman, identified as Karen Anklam, 26, of New Orleans, was
not arrested. She was ordered out of the Capitol and allowed to
listen to the Senate debate on loudspeakers.
   ``They're not going to stop abortion,'' she said later.
``They're just going to make it so that everything's going to go
completely haywire.''
   State police allowed almost 200 demonstrators _ almost all of
them backers of the abortion bill _ to enter the Senate chamber.
They allowed 500 others into the rotunda, the wide, high-ceilinged,
marble-floored hall that separates the Senate and House chambers.
   Several hundred more gathered on the steps of the Capitol.
Inside and out, the demonstrators sang hymns or broke into chants
of ``Override! Override!'' The chants echoing through the rotunda
could be heard in the Senate chamber.
   Some demonstrators knelt in silent prayer for several minutes at
a time.
   Abortion rights advocates but were greatly outnumbered. One
group of about 100 chanted ``Sustain the veto!''

<TEXT>
   A television station has filed suit against
the federal government, trying to obtain documents about a 1985
plane crash in Canada that killed 248 U.S. soldiers.
   KDKA filed the suit June 29 against the Justice Department, the
FBI, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the National
Transportation Safety Board after making unsuccessful requests for
documents, said KDKA Managing Editor Jim Esser.
   The Pittsburgh station had made 70 requests under provisions of
the federal Freedom of Information Act, he said.
   ``We got very little,'' Esser said. ``We got some information,
but nothing we considered significant.''
   Since January, KDKA has been investigating the December 1985
crash of an Arrow Air charter jet at Gander, Newfoundland, which
also killed eight crew members, Esser said.
   The plane was bringing the soldiers back from a mission in the
Middle East. Fourteen of the victims were from western Pennsylvania.
   Esser would not say specifically what the station hoped to find
in the materials it requested in the lawsuit, filed in U.S.
District Court in Washington, D.C.
   ```Documents related to the crash' is all we're prepared to
say,'' Esser said.
   He said KDKA has not received a response to the suit.
   A South Carolina congressman also has investigated the crash and
issued a statement Friday about KDKA's lawsuit.
   ``Although the official Canadian and United States statement is
that ice on the wings caused the crash, there has been substantial
evidence to suggest that the plane was downed by an incendiary
device,'' Rep. Robin Tallon said.
   He lauded the television statement for pursuing the inquiry.
   Tallon became involved in the Gander investigation on behalf of
constituents who lost relatives in the crash, said spokeswoman Jean
Margaret Smith. Tallon's work has been ``along the same lines'' as
KDKA's research, Ms. Smith said.
   Tallon has sought both congressional hearings on the crash and
in an inquiry by the executive branch, Ms. Smith said.

<HEAD>Brazilian Pop Musician Cazuza Dies of AIDS at 32</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cazuza, a top pop singer and
composer in Brazil who emerged as a national symbol in the fight
against AIDS, died in his sleep Saturday after a four-year struggle
with the disease. He was 32.
   Cazuza, who suffered from respiratory problems his last three
days, died in his parents' home in the beachfront neighborhood of
Ipanema.
   ``Fortunately, he died without pain, sleeping,'' his father,
Joao Araujo, director of one of the largest record companies in
Brazil, said on television.
   TV film footage showed hundreds of weeping fans crowding into
Sao Joao Batista Church in Rio's Botofogo neighborhood where a wake
was held.
   Cazuza began as a singer in small clubs. His career took off in
1984 when he joined the hard-rock band ``Barao Vermelho,''
Portuguese for Red Baron. The band produced three hit records
before Cazuza left to record on his own.
   Mixing Bossa Nova music with 1960s British and American rock, he
composed and recorded ``Cazuza,'' his first solo album in 1985, a
record known for its biting, sarcastic tone and lyrics.
   Cazuza's music underwent a transformation after doctors
confirmed he had AIDS in 1986. His songs gained a poetic quality,
the lyrics focusing on his struggle to live.
   He produced four more records, including the live album ``Time
Doesn't Stop'' and the hit ``Ideology,'' for which he received the
Sharp Prize for Best Brazilian Pop-Rock Artist in 1988. His solo
records combined have sold 1.1 million copies in Brazil.
   In April, he returned from Boston where he underwent AIDS
treatment, pledging to return to the stage. However, he was
bedridden for much of the time until his death.
   His funeral was held Saturday at the Sao Joao Batista cemetery.
He was survived by his parents.

   A civilian pilot testing an
Air Force target drone was forced to eject from the plane before it
crashed in the Gulf of Mexico about 12 miles offshore.
   The crew of a charter fishing boat pulled the pilot from the
water Friday and he was in good condition at a base hospital, Air
Force officials said.
   Willard F. Inscoe, 53, of Durham, N.C., is an operations manager
for Westar Corp. of Albuquerque, N.M., which is testing the QF-106
drones under contract with the Air Force.
   The drones, converted F-106 Delta Dart fighters, are based at
Tyndall but come under the supervision of the Munitions Systems
Division at nearby Eglin Air Force Base.
   Susan Brown, a spokeswoman for the munitions division, said the
cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The drones, which can fly at twice the speedy of sound, normally
are unmanned and flown by remote control, but pilots occasionally
test them. The planes are used for target practice and missile
development and testing.

<HEAD>Serbia Continues Clampdown in Ethnic Albanian Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's republic of Serbia
tightened its grip on the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo
province Saturday by disbanding the official trade union
organization there.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the council of trade unions
of Serbia acted because the Kosovo council ``failed to perform its
role.''
   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo, the Albanian-language daily
Rilindija carried a sharp protest of Serbia's ``occupation of
Kosovo.''
   Ethnic Albanians dominate the province and their leaders issued
a declaration of independence last Monday.
   Serbia responded Thursday by dissolving Kosovo's local governing
bodies, replacing the managers and leading journalists of local
news organizations and taking Albanian-language radio and
television programs off the air.
   On Friday, Serbian authorities detained several ethnic Albanians
and large numbers of uniformed police took up positions throughout
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, about 150 miles south of Belgrade.
Heightened security also was reported from other towns in the
province.
   Kosovo was calm on Saturday, Tanjug reported.
   A group of provincial deputies demanded an emergency session of
the federal legislature to discuss the situation.
   Serbian authorities dissolved the local assembly and government
after 114 assembly members announced plans to secede from Serbia,
the largest of the country's six republics. Both bodies were
dominated by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
province's 1.9 million people.
   Serbia's moves have virtually abolished the autonomy granted the
southern province under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with security
forces since Serbia began limiting autonomy in March 1989.
   Serbians consider Kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom.
They allege ethnic Albanians, in seeking independence, have
pressured Serbians to move out.
   Ethnic Albanians, who want free elections and a multiparty
system, deny Serbia's charges.
   They say Serbia's Communist leader, Slobodan Milosevic, has used
such accusations to gain popular support for his drive to control
Kosovo.
   The trouble in Kosovo is one of many besetting Yugoslavia's
fragile Communist-run federal governement.
   The northern republic of Slovenia on Monday adopted a
declaration of regional autonomy and said it would take control of
Yugoslav military on its soil.
   Yugoslavia's federal leadership on Friday demanded that the
republic rescind its proclamation, but Slovenia's presidency on
Saturday refused, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   The authority of the federal leadership has effectively been
crippled since non-Communist, center-right parties won elections
this year in Slovenia and Croatia, another liberal republic. It was
the first free balloting in Yugoslavia in 50 years.
   Slovenia and Croatia are demanding a looser national
confederation.
   The current federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces already allows each region to run its own government and
Communist party structure.
   The decentralized system of government was devised by the late
national leader Josip Broz Tito. It was intended to prevent one
republic from gaining sway over the others, but ethnic and economic
differences are again threatening the country's unity.

<TEXT>
   Up to 10 inches of rain caused flooding Saturday in southeastern
Minnesota, with rain also scattered elsewhere in the eastern half
of the nation, and temperatures dipped to record lows in the
Northeast.
   The rain in Minnesota flooded numerous roads and forced
evacuation of some low-lying campgrounds.
   Rainfall amounts ranged from 3 to 7 inches and there were
unofficial reports of up to 10 inches in Rice County, the National
Weather Service said.
   The State Patrol closed a highway covered by 2-3 feet of water
between Zumbrota and Pine Island, northwest of Rochester.
   No injuries were reported.
   Heavy rain also fell in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and the
weather service warned of possible flooding of highway approach
ramps and underpasses.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over Wisconsin, western
Upper Michigan, northern Illinois, northwestern Minnesota, eastern
North Dakota and northeastern Iowa.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms spread rain over
west-central Florida, west-central Alabama, east-central
Mississippi, southeastern North Carolina, northeastern South
Carolina, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over
northern Maine, Arizona and south-central Utah.
   Thunderstorms produced about an inch of rain in the Green Valley
area of south-central Arizona, south of Tucson, during less than an
hour and and a flash flood warning was issued for eastern Pima
County.
   The heat wave that rolled across the nation was definitely over
in the Northeast. Binghamton, N.Y., had a record low of 49 and
Youngstown, Ohio, had a record of 42. Records were tied at Buffalo,
N.Y., at 50 degrees, and Toledo, Ohio, at 47.
   But the heat lingered in the Southeast, where Augusta, Ga., tied
its record of 104. Other Georgia cities also topped 100. The
temperature also hit 100 at Jacksonville, Fla., and Montgomery, Ala.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 at
Rhinelander, Wis., to 103 in Georgia at Augusta, Macon and Warner
Robins.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Truckee, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Eight of the saboteurs who blew up a key
factory in Nazi Germany's atomic bomb project held their first
reunion Saturday, reliving one of World War II's most daring secret
exploits.
   The eight Norwegians, all in their 70s and retired, led several
thousand people who walked along a new ``Saboteurs' Trail,'' a
five-mile path that follows the route they used to reach the
German-operated plant in Telemark County.
   ``We didn't recognize the importance of what we did until the
atomic bomb was dropped on Japan,'' said Joachim Roenneberg,
recalling the night of Feb. 28, 1943, when the 10 men blew up the
Nazi Heavy Water plant near Rjukan, 125 miles northwest of Oslo.
   The Allies, fearing Germany would build an atomic bomb before
the West, had ordered the plant destroyed at any cost. After an
aircraft carrying British commandos crashed in occupied Norway, it
was up to the Norwegians.
   On Saturday, the eight saboteurs attending the ceremony stood at
attention for the Norwegian national anthem. One of the 10 has died
and another was unable to attend.
   Women and children handed them flowers and many in the crowd
cried.
   Volunteers in Rjukan, a town of 4,500, built the hiking trail.
   The 10 Norwegians have been celebrated in books and movies,
including the American film production, ``Heroes of Telemark.''
   Roenneberg, who led the expedition at 23 years old, said: ``It
was not like a military operation. It was more like a group of
friends who set out to do something together.''
   The mostly British-trained saboteurs parachuted into Norway and,
weeks later, approached Rjukan. New York-born Knut Haukelig said
they slid down a mountain through wet snow and waited for darkness.
   One man remained behind as a radio operator. Five stayed near a
German barracks, ready to fight if the German soldiers were alerted.
   Four saboteurs found an unguarded railroad line leading to the
plant and crawled through a pipe into its basement. They met only a
Norwegian technician, who did not resist.
   Roenneberg said they set explosives with fuses that gave them 30
seconds to escape. The saboteurs made their way back into the
mountains and some skied 250 miles in 14 days to Sweden, before
heading back to England.

   As state senators quietly debated
whether to override Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto of a strict
anti-abortion bill Saturday, hundreds of demonstrators shouted
their stands as they broiled in the sun outside.
   The Senate sustained Roemer's veto of what would have been the
nation's toughest state abortion law. The vote was 23 in favor of
the override _ three short of the two-thirds majority needed _ and
16 against.
   Before senators cast their ballots, the parking lot at the
skyscraper Capitol was jammed with about 1,500 people as
temperatures inched into the 90s.
   State troopers limited access to the building, allowing almost
200 spectators in the Senate chamber, with another 500 in the
rotunda separating the House and Senate chambers. Several hundred
more gathered on the Capitol steps or under shade trees on the
grounds.
   Most of the crowd was in favor of the strict anti-abortion bill,
which would send abortionists to jail for up to 10 years.
   Anti-abortionists' cries of ``override, override'' pervaded the
thick stone walls of the Senate chamber, in which every chair was
filled and spectators lined up along the walls.
   Another anti-abortion rally was held on the Capitol lawn, while
about 100 pro-choice demonstrators stood on the steps above them,
shouting ``sustain that veto'' and ``church and state _ separate.''
   After the Senate voted to sustain, one pro-choice supporter
yelled ``all right'' and was told by security officers to be quiet.
   Then she ran from the chamber, screaming ``I'm out of here.''
   As other viewers quietly filed out of the gallery, abortion
rights supporters waved purple flowers and ribbons in the rotunda,
shouting: ``We won.''
   Anti-abortionists countered with ``We will win. We will win.''
   The Senate was to vote against Sunday on the override measure.

   A couple with cerebral palsy who use a golf
cart to drive city streets are challenging police orders to get
them off the road, saying the car provides their only means of
transport.
   John L. Shauberger, 45, of Lake City, was cited May 21 for
driving without a license and operating an unregistered vehicle. He
faced a magistrate's hearing, which was scheduled for Friday but
suspended.
   If he is convicted and ordered not to drive the cart on public
streets, Shauberger said, he and Kathy would be forced to walk with
a cane or depend on others for rides.
   ``That's not independence as far as I'm concerned,'' said
Shauberger, who added that he can't afford a car modified for
handicapped drivers.
   Shauberger can walk with the assistance of a cane. His
28-year-old wife is confined to a wheelchair.
   District Justice Charles Wise suspended completion of the
hearing because Shauberger's lawyer could not attend. Wise said he
would rule on the traffic citations and decide whether to fine
Shauberger $370 after the lawyer presents his case.
   Wise said he would consider whether the golf cart qualifies as a
wheelchair when he rules on the citations.
   State Trooper Paul McGuire, who testified Friday, said
wheelchairs are exempt from being registered, although operators
must be licensed to travel on roads.
   ``I think the essence of this whole case is really ... the
definition of a wheelchair,'' Wise said. ``It would seem to me that
a golf cart would be safer than a little narrow wheelchair on the
highway.''
   The magistrate said Shauberger had been cited for driving in a
traffic lane of the highway without a drivers license in an
unregistered cart.
   McGuire has stopped Shauberger twice this year. He said he and
other troopers previously had warned Shauberger not to drive on the
highway.

<HEAD>Poorest Countries Seeking More Aid, Debt Relief At Summits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's poorest nations have told the
industrial countries meeting at a Houston summit that they must
provide more aid and debt relief to avoid a spiral of poverty and
social unrest in the Third World.
   ``It is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no
substitute for a market economy, and this is what we strive to
achieve,'' said A.H.G. Mohiuddin, U.N. ambassador of Bangladesh and
spokesman for the 42 nations known as the Least Developed Countries.
   ``But if our efforts are not met by commensurate aid, we will be
faced with social unrest which will undo all our good work,'' he
said in an interview before this week's Houston summit of the
United States and six other leading industrial nations.
   ``We have tightened our belts beyond our capacity, and if there
is a failure in reciprocal commitment (from the industrial world),
then it will be suicidal for us,'' he said.
   Mohiuddin has visited the capitals of the seven nations to
``sensitize'' them to the needs of the impoverished Third World,
the poorest of the poor.
   The poor nations are calling for development assistance in the
form of .15 percent of the industrial nations' gross national
product by 1995 and .20 percent by the end of the decade. They also
seek debt cancellation and reduction and removal of trade barriers
to their exports.
   In general, the Bangladesh envoy said, the response was positive
_ but not specific. The poorest nations hope that the final
communique from the Houston summit will address some of their
problems.
   Nordic countries and most participants in the Houston summit are
approaching or have reached the development assistance sought by
the poor nations.
   However, the United States and Japan, which give extensive aid,
have opposed aid targets. The United States gives about .04 percent
of its GNP, the total annual value of produced goods and services,
to the world's poorest nations.
   The Houston session could foreshadow what will happen at an
international conference on the Least Developed Countries in Paris
in September, when a plan of domestic action and foreign help is to
be developed. Officials of the poorest nations hope the wealthiest
ones will persuade others in the international arena to support
their cause.
   But the wealthiest nations recently have been emphasizing the
importance of respecting human rights and instituting democratic
political reforms as conditions for foreign aid in Eastern Europe
and elsewhere.
   The poorest nations respond by saying that poverty is the
greatest obstacle to human rights everywhere.
   The poorest nations have expressed concern that aid to the
emerging democracies of Eastern Europe should not take away from
the industrial nations' commitment to help the poorest countries,
which have a total of 475 million people.
   The Least Developed Countries, as defined by the World Bank, are
the world's most abjectly poor, with average per capita incomes of
less than $500 per year.
   Their total foreign debt is about $55 billion. Their annual debt
service payment alone is nearly $4 billion.

   The ARCO Chemical Co.'s inquiry into
the plant explosion that killed 17 people has been stymied by a
court order issued Saturday for the wife of a deceased worker.
   In response to her negligence lawsuit against the company, a
judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing Atlantic
Richfield Co. and ARCO Chemical from making any changes to the
accident scene.
   Atlantic Richfield, based in Los Angeles, owns 83 percent of
ARCO Chemical.
   ``We can't remove anything until OSHA releases the area to us,''
said Jack Johnson, president of ARCO Chemical Americas. He refused
to comment further on the lawsuit, filed Friday by Sandra Lucas
Davis.
   Her husband, Gregory Scott Davis, 27, was one of the names on a
partial list of victims released by the company Saturday.
   State District Judge Shearn Smith issued the temporary
restraining order, but it did not prohibit OSHA, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, from conducting its investigation.
   OSHA officials, who were sifting through the damaged area,
expect to complete their investigation in about a week, Johnson
said.
   Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard F. Scannell said Friday his
agency was focusing on maintenance reports and complaints that
employees had to work especially long hours at the plant.
   Plant manager Earl McCaleb said workers normally work 12-hour
shifts for four days, then are off four days.
   Harold Sorgenti, president of ARCO Chemical, said the company
was concentrating on helping families and employees deal with the
deaths, while making sure the plant is stabilized.
   The explosion at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday ripped through the
plant's utility area on the extreme southern end of the complex
where employees were doing maintenance work, officials said.
   What the employees actually were doing ``will be determined by
the investigation,'' Sorgenti said. ``Initially, they were
beginning to fix a compressor.''
   Initial speculation was that the five ARCO workers and 11 Austin
Industrial Inc. contract workers killed were cleaning the
900,000-gallon tank that exploded. The other worker killed was the
driver of a vacuum truck that was in the area to remove rainwater
from a sump, McCaleb said.
   Sorgenti also said the investigation will focus on why so many
people were in the area when normally five people are assigned
there.
   ``I think it's difficult to understand why there was that
concentration of employees in that area at that time,'' said
Sorgenti, who flew to Houston from Europe where he was on business.
   McCaleb said it would be several months before the plant begins
operating again. The 350 ARCO employees at the plant, about 15
miles east of Houston, are working to restore the plant and will
not lose any pay, he said.
   The ARCO plant annually produces 560 million pounds of propylene
oxide, used to make flexible foam for seat cushions and bedding. It
also produces 1.3 billion pounds of styrene monomer, used for
insulation, foam drinking cups, packaging materials and automotive
parts; and 1.7 billion pounds of methyl tertiary butyl ether, a
high-octane blending component used as a replacement for lead in
gasoline.
   The explosion was the second major loss of life at a Houston
area petrochemical facility in nine months. On Oct. 23, a series of
explosions ripped through a Phillips Petroleum Co. plant in
Pasadena, claiming 23 lives and injuring 130 people.

   Thousands of Albanians crowding into
foreign embassies in hopes of fleeing their hard-line Communist
homeland will be allowed to emigrate under foreign supervision,
diplomats said Saturday.
   Also Saturday, the government announced a shake-up of the ruling
Politburo and Central Committee. It replaced several hard-liners,
including the police minister.
   About 5,000 people are sheltered in missions in the Albanian
capital of Tirana, Western dipomats said. Many had climbed walls
and crashed through embassy gates, some under fire from security
forces, to gain entry.
   Hungarian diplomats said the logistics of the emigration had not
been worked out, but ambassadors were told by Albanian Foreign
Ministry officials their personnel could supervise the issuing of
travel documents and accompany emigres out of the country.
   ``A solution has been found,'' Hungarian Ambassador Mihaly
Kornidesz told state radio in Budapest. ``Passports will be issued,
and embassy personnel will be allowed to oversee ... safe passage
out of the country.''
   Austria's APA news agency said thousands of protesters gathered
near embassy row Saturday to show their opposition to the hard-line
Communist regime. No violence was reported.
   Friday, 10,000 pro-democracy demonstrators marched in silence
near embassy row, APA reported. The silent rally dispersed after a
brief clash between police and some demonstrators.
   Reacting to the unrest, the policy-setting Central Committee of
the Communist Party dismissed a Politburo member, retired three
other politicians and relieved Police Minister Simon Stefani of his
position, the state news agency ATA reported.
   Hekuran Isaj, who is regarded as a moderate, was announced as
Stefani's replacement, ATA reported.
   ATA also reported that three new figures were appointed to the
Politburo and two new appointments were made to the Central
Committee.
   The changes appeared to reflect the power of Communist leader
Ramiz Alia and his efforts to reform Albania's hard-line Communist
system.
   Also Saturday, Alia decreed several measures to reform Albania's
command economy, including the introduction of small-scale private
enterprise limited to tradesmen and farmers. He did not, however,
mention the embassy standoff or promise political reforms.
   Speaking from Tirana, a Hungarian diplomat said on condition of
anonymity that police sealed off the diplomatic quarter Saturday
afternoon, apparently to prevent new asylum-seekers from gaining
access to the missions.
   The reported breakthrough came just hours after Albanian
legislators guaranteed citizens could leave the embassies without
fear of punishment.
   The Albanian Foreign Ministry on Thursday promised to grant
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign missions.
   But Saturday's parliamentary decree, published by the Albanian
state news agency ATA, was the first pledge with the force of law
that Albanians in the foreign missions could receive passports
without fear or prosecution.
   The thousands of Albanians in the foreign embassies were a
near-intolerable strain on some missions, which lacked sufficient
food and water. Albanian authorities were not allowing foreign
governments to send supplies, Western officials said.
   The Hungarian diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that under the deal worked out with authorities, the Albanians were
to remain in the embassies until told their passports were ready.
   ``On the day of their departure, or on the day immediately
preceding it, they will be going in groups to the passport office
to get documents and can be accompanied by embassy staffers,'' he
said.
   Diplomats will be invited to board the aircraft, trains, buses
or boats taking Albanians to their new homelands, the diplomat
said. But only those accepted by a foreign country will be allowed
to leave, he said.
   The diplomat said he believed France had already pledged to take
in all Albanians packing its embassy.
   In the 45 years of hard-line Communist rule, travel for average
Albanians has been virtually impossible.
   But under Alia, who took power in 1985, the country of 3.2
million people has increasingly sought ties abroad and has slowly
begun to implement reforms.
   A package of new regulations that took effect Tuesday entitled
all Albanians over age 16 to own a passport.
   The ATA dispatch said the embassy occupations were calculated to
create ``a state of tension and opposition to the laws and
regulations of the Albanian state.''
   ``This is also proved by the fact that some countries want to
send here food, tents medicaments, so as to turn the yards of the
embassies into refugees' camps.
   ``Such brutal interference and anti-human acts are unacceptable
and punishable,'' ATA said.
   On Friday, Alia told the Central Committee that the party would
not give up power as Communists have done elsewhere in Eastern
Europe.
   The sometimes-violent rush to the embassies in Tirana follows
last year's exodus of East Germans to embassies in other East
European countries shortly before the fall of their Communist
government.
   Most of the Albanians who fled to foreign embassies before
Thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began Monday under
fire from Albanian security forces. Diplomats said at least three
people were wounded.

<HEAD>Defense Rests Case In Trial Of Four Accused In DEA Agent Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense has rested its case in the trial
of four men charged in the torture-slaying of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   Before Friday's conclusion of the defense case, U.S. District
Judge Edward Rafeedie admitted into evidence Mexican telephone
records that raised doubts about testimony given by a key
prosecution witness.
   Hector Cervantes Santos, a former bodyguard for narcotics
trafficker Javier Barba Hernandez, testified that drug lords
planned the kidnap-murder of Camarena in late 1984 and early 1985
at Barba's Guadalajara home.
   Cervantes testified that phone calls were made and received at
the home while the slaying was being planned. But records from
Mexico's national telephone company show there was no telephone
service in that area until early 1988.
   Rafeedie said he expected closing arguments this week after the
prosecution calls rebuttal witnesses.
   On trial in the 1985 torture-slayings of Camarena, his Mexican
pilot and two U.S. tourists in Guadalajara are Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, a convicted Honduran drug trafficker; Ruben Zuno Arce,
a businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican policeman;
and Javier Vasquez Velasco.
   The judge refused to admit defense testimony from a government
informant.
   Lawrence Victor Harrison testified at a hearing with the jury
absent that Mexican drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo told
him he funded the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua and
felt protected from U.S. prosecution because of it. Felix Gallardo
is in a Mexican prison for drug trafficking.
   But the judge ruled that Harrison's statements were based on
secondhand information and did not bear directly on the trial.
   ``This witness' testimony is based on hearsay, gossip and
speculation,'' the judge said after two hours of questioning. ``The
court found this witness' testimony incompetent.''
   Harrison, 45, was recalled to the witness stand after revelation
of a DEA interview in which Harrison claimed the CIA had trained
Guatemalan guerrillas at a Veracruz, Mexico, ranch owned by drug
trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero, who is serving a prison term in
Mexico for Camarena's murder.
   The defense had hoped to argue that the Guadalajara cocaine
cartel operated by Caro and Felix Gallardo had ties to the CIA.
   The CIA has denied any involvement in drug trafficking.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, was released Saturday from Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh after two days of testing, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   The 13-year-old girl from White Settlement, Texas, had been
readmitted to the hospital Thursday so doctors could monitor her
liver function and medication levels. Spokeswoman Lynn McMahon said
Stormie had experienced mild rejection and physicians adjusted her
medication.
   Stormie underwent the first heart-liver transplant on
Valentine's Day 1984 because of a congenital condition that gave
her cholesterol levels 10 times normal. Hepatitis damaged that
liver and she received her second liver in February of this year.
   Doctors discovered last month that Stormie had developed
hepatitis. They reduced the amount of anti-rejection medicine she
was receiving so her body could combat the infection in her liver.

<HEAD>Thousands of Bulgarians Rally After Communist President Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 10,000 people rallied in a
downtown square Saturday to celebrate the resignation of Communist
President Petar Mladenov.
   He resigned Friday after admitting he had called for tanks be
used to crush an anti-Communist demonstration last year. His
departure came less than three weeks after his party of reformed
Communists won the country's first free elections in 58 years.
   Mladenov was instrumental in last year's ousting of Communist
strongman Todor Zhivkov. Prodded by popular demonstrations,
Mladenov then played a key role in reforming the party, now known
as the democratic Socialist Party.
   Saturday's peaceful rally was organized by students who had been
on strike demandiong that Mladenov step down.
   Most of the student groups involved in the strike announced they
would stop Saturday. But about 1,000 students continued a sit-in in
front of Parliament to promote other demands, including the setting
of a trial date for Zhivkov and removal of former Communist
functionaries from Parliament.
   Zhivkov has been charged with misappropriation of state
property, abuse of power, and inciting ethnic hostility. During his
rule, ethnic Turks were assimilated into Bulgarian society by force.
   Blaga Dimitrova, a writer and one of Bulgaria's few dissidents
under the old regime, praised the campaign that led to Mladenov's
resignation.
   ``It was a fight not against a person, but against a demoralized
system,'' she told cheering participants during Saturday's rally.
The event was dubbed the ``Rally of Joy and Victory.''
   Mladenov stepped down after weeks of mounting pressure generated
by revelations he had suggested that tanks move against an
anti-government rally outside Parliament late last year. No tanks
were used.

   About 300 Haitian demonstrators chanted and marched
peacefully Saturday outside a shopping center where police had
violently broken up a demonstration two days earlier.
   ``From South Africa to South Florida, apartheid must go!''
protest leaders chanted through megaphones.
   A Haitian exile leader, the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, said the
demonstration was aimed at opposing violence against blacks and
Haitians in stores and by police.
   ``Today's protest is to stop the trend,'' he said. ``We're
saying stop the beating, stop the violence, whether it comes from
black or white or Hispanics.''
   Authorities issued a permit for up to 100 people to rally for
three hours Saturday afternoon on a sidewalk across the street from
the shopping center.
   They were watched by about 130 police officers in riot gear and
on horseback.
   Police had earlier refused a permit allowing protesters near a
clothing store.
   The Rapid Transit Factory Outlet and its Cuban-born owner have
been the target of a series of protests following the alleged
beating of a Haitian customer June 29 in a dispute over a pair of
pants. The store remained open Saturday.
   Store owner Luis Reyes, 65, claims it was his son who was the
victim of the altercation.
   Tensions between blacks and Hispanics in Miami also are strained
by the refusal by Mayor Xavier Suarez and other politicians to
welcome anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela last month. The
officials said they were opposed to the South African's links to
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   On Thursday, police carrying clubs and shields arrested 58
protesters who refused orders to disperse from in front of the
store. Seven of those arrested were taken into custody by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and could face deportation.
   Jean-Juste has called for a boycott against the Rapid Transit
store and any other business that treated Haitians poorly.
   ``Our normal customers are mostly staying away, but
Spanish-speaking people have responded to what they feel is an
injustice caused by a small segment of the community,'' said Reyes.
   Reyes promised to remain open as long as customers keep coming.
   ``This is a fight we are not backing down from,'' he said.

<HEAD>Insurance Billing Chief Arrested For Taking Bribes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An executive whose company processes
thousands of claims for the state's troubled high-risk insurance
pool was arrested Saturday for allegedly taking bribes to allow
auto body shops to inflate bills.
   William P. Horan, an executive with Computer Science Corp., was
arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering by acts of
commercial bribery and theft, said a spokesman for Attorney General
Robert Del Tufo.
   Five alleged co-conspirators _ four body-shop owners or managers
and an appraiser _ also were arrested.
   New Jersey's insurance system is being overhauled. A new law
requires the industry to pay $1.4 billion during the next seven
years to help eliminate the $3.1 billion debt amassed by a pool for
high-risk drivers overseen by the Joint Underwriting Association.
   The association, whose financing costs every New Jersey motorist
$222 per car on their annual policy, is to be eliminated under the
law.
   Computer Science Corp. is the second-largest computer service
company working for the underwriting assocation, processing
hundreds of thousands claims annually, said Robert T. Winter,
director of the Division of Criminal Justice.
   Horan ``received tens of dollars in bribe money to insure that
certain body shops got the claims and that the inflated billings
would be approved for payment,'' Winter said.
   Horan, a group director of field operations for Computer
Science's computer division, was arraigned before Superior Court
Judge Paul Chaiet and released on $50,000 bail, said Chuck Davis,
spokesman for Del Tufo.
   An 18-month investigation uncovered an ``extensive'' scheme to
funnel money to Horan from auto body shops and appraisal companies,
Winter said.
   The body shops and appraisal firms would repair the damaged
vehicles and send inflated invoices to the underwriting
association, Winter said. Horan was charged with assuring that the
inflated claims were approved, with the underwriting association
footing the bill, Winter said.
   Authorities had no evidence to indicate that other Computer
Science officials were involved in the scheme, Winter said. A woman
answering the telephone at the company's Piscataway office said an
official would not be available for comment until Monday.
   Telephone calls placed to Horan's home on Saturday seeking
comment were not answered.
   Horan was accused of committing the acts between Feb. 3, 1989
and June 29, 1990.
   Jon Shure, spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio, said the arrests were
part of the governor's plan to bring fairness to New Jersey
motorists, who pay among the highest premiums in the country.
   ``When Governor Florio signed the insurance reform law it was
more than a commitment to lower rates,'' Shure said. ``It was a
pledge to bring back fairness for New Jersey drivers, and that
means vigorously pursuing any cases where the people of the state
are being ripped off.''
   Also accused of conspiracy to commit racketeering through the
act of commercial bribery and theft were Nicholas J. Caliendo of
Colts Neck, vice president of Rural Body Works, Inc.; Kennedy E.
Kowalski of Freehold, owner of Ken's Auto Body; Robert C. Smith of
Wall, manager of Bill Murray's Auto Body &amp; Glass, Inc.; Michael J.
Bavaro of Colts Neck, president of Bodymotion, Inc.; and John F.
Vuono of Neptune, president of Shore Appraisal Service.
   Caliendo was arraigned before Holmdel Municipal Judge Kenneth
Smith and released on $50,000 bail. Bail was set at $50,000 for
Bavaro and $30,000 each for Kowalski, Smith and Vunon.

   The J. Paul Getty Museum has removed a
prized marble sculpture from public display to determine if it is
fake or an authentic 6th century B.C. Greek statue.
   Doubt about the kouros, a 6-foot-8 carving of a nude male youth,
was raised during the examination of another work, a marble torso
regarded as a fake or modern copy that was recently acquired by the
Getty for study.
   The kouros was removed from display Friday.
   ``When I first saw the torso in April this year, I noticed
subtle similarities of style and detail between the piece and the
museum's kouros,'' said Marion True, curator of antiquities. ``This
gave me reason to re-examine our own statue.''
   Some experts have doubted the Getty kouros, purchased in 1985
for an undisclosed price from a private collector. Only about a
dozen complete kouros figures are known to exist.
   Two years ago the museum discovered that a marble ``Head of
Achilles'' in its collection was a modern copy.

   Police fired bullets and tear gas Saturday
at thousands of demonstrators who defied a government ban and held
a rally demanding a multiparty democracy.
   The disturbances quickly spread throughout the city and police
pursued demonstrators into Nairobi's commercial center.
   The violence comes after months of agitation for multiparty
democracy in Kenya, which has been a one-party state by law since
1982.
   Riot police moved through the streets Saturday firing into the
air and telling crowds to disperse. By nightfall, only small groups
of demonstrators remained, clashing sporadically with troops.
   It was not immediately known if there were any casualties.
Witnesses said they saw security forces beat people.
   The violence broke out after about 500 protesters gathered at a
field several blocks from Nairobi's busy commercial center for a
rally to demand democracy.
   Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, leading opponents of the
government who were detained last week, had called for the rally.
   Authorities had denied permission for the rally, and President
Daniel arap Moi said force would be used to break it up.
   ``We want two parties!'' many protesters shouted, waving two
fingers in the local multiparty salute. They were joined by
thousands of others who had watched the rally from the ground's
fringes.
   The demonstrators, many carrying rocks, then broke into crowds
numbering in the hundreds and faced off with security forces who
tried to block roads around the field. Trucks bearing dozens of
armed soldiers headed toward the field.
   When protesters stoned a plainclothes police officer and his car
and commandeered a bus, security forces charged the crowd, firing
bullets and tear gas.
   Panic-stricken groups ran into downtown Nairobi. Workers poured
out of their offices and formed large crowds at bus stops as
hundreds tried to flee the city. Most traffic other than buses was
quickly gone from the streets.
   The atmosphere remained tense hours after the clashes.
Surrounding streets were littered with rocks, glass and other
debris.
   Thousands of people milled around downtown Nairobi, and special
riot police moved through the streets firing into the air and
telling crowds to disperse.
   Sporadic gunfire could be heard downtown throughout the
afternoon. A few shops were looted and isolated groups of
demonstrators reportedly stoned some cars.
   Kenya has been at peace since independence from Britain in 1963.
It often is cited as an example of stability and prosperity on a
continent known more for guerrilla warfare, military juntas and
corrupt dictatorship.
   Since the beginning of the year, however, a loose coalition
emboldened by the changes in Eastern Europe has repeatedly accused
the ruling Kenya African National Union party of intolerance,
corruption and election-rigging.
   Demands for change began Jan. 1 in an address by the Rev.
Timothy Njhoya, long a critic of the government. The Presbyterian
pastor urged Africans to reflect on the experience of Eastern
Europe and choose multiparty democracy.
   However, the government has rejected any move toward allowing
other parties and calls its opponents subversives. Moi says
multiparty politics would create ethnic strife among the East
African nation's 40 tribes and lead to tribal warfare.
   Moi has said he will hunt down political pluralists ``like
rats.''
   The government has detained at least 11 opponents since
Wednesday, according to their families and other sources close to
the opposition.
   Matiba and Rubia, former Cabinet ministers, were seized by
plainclothes security agents. Other detainees include Raila Odinga,
son of Kenya's first vice president, and Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer
who edits a magazine critical of the government's human rights
record.
   Kenya's last opposition party was banned in 1969. A
constitutional amendment in 1982 declared Kenya a one-party state,
and last week's detentions appeared to be the harshest crackdown
since 1982.
   Moi has said the existence of about 40 tribes in Kenya would
invite tribal-based parties, leading to ethnic divisions and even
tribal warfare.
   On Friday, the U.S. State Department said the detentions ``only
serve to tarnish Kenya's image in the international community,''
and it urged the government not to persecute the opposition.

<HEAD>Teachers' Group Votes Down Bid to Stop Pro-Choice Lobbying</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to update with delegates' defeat of
efforts to stop abortion lobbying, picking up at the 3rd graf

   Delegates to the National Education
Association convention on Saturday easily defeated an attempt to
stop the union's policy of lobbying for abortion rights.
   The union was expected to re-examine its stance in favor of
women's right to abortion at least twice more before it concludes
business late Sunday. The union in 1985 agreed to support family
planning, including ``the right to reproductive freedom.''
   Christine Nowak of New York led efforts to eliminate abortion
lobbying from the legislative agenda of the nation's largest
teachers' union. She and others argued that union dues should not
be used for such activity because the NEA's 2 million members have
a variety of views on the issue.
   In a resounding voice vote, the 8,100 delegates to the group's
annual convention rejected the legislative amendment.
   NEA officials said the union has not yet spent money on the
issue because it has not come up in Congress.
   The action came only hours after television producer Norman
Lear, a leading advocate of the separation of church and state,
urged the NEA delegates to focus more on morals during classroom
instructions.
   ``As educators, you probably have more to do with the character
of the next generation than anyone else,'' Lear told the educators.
   ``In a sense, you are the architects of that generation,'' he
said.
   Lear said teachers cannot successfully instill knowledge in
young people's minds unless they also ``feed the heart and soul.''
   Neither can schools spark students' interest in the world,
social wrongs and personal morality unless they also teach about
the core values that bind society together, he said.
   Educators must ``fling open the doors and find new ways of
learning more about each other's values and spiritual traditional
and what we all hold in common,'' he said.
   Today's societal problems are the result of a lack of focus on
the ``inner life,'' said Lear, describing that as ``that portion of
ourselves that impels us to create art and literature, and study
ethics, philosophy and history.''
   ``Greed is the order of the day in a society preoccupied at all
levels with the pursuit of bottom-lines, a society which celebrates
consumption, careerism, and winning, and lives by the creed of
`I've-got-mine-Jack,''' he said.
   To illustrate the destructiveness of this ethic, Lear pointed to
``our alarming environmental woes,'' frequent oil spills at sea,
the extinction of 10,000 species per year and teen pregnancies.
   The Emmy award-winning television producer is best known for
prime time sitcoms like ``All in the Family'' and ``The
Jeffersons.'' He founded the civil libertarian organization People
For the American Way as a response to the growing religious right
movement.
   Although a long-time foe of the religious right, he credited the
conservative group with sparking his ideas.
   Lear cautioned that teaching about religion should not trample
on the sensibilities of minority faiths and ``that neither teachers
nor students proselytize.''

   A worker backing Sandinista labor
strikes died Saturday from wounds he suffered during clashes with
government supporters.
   Meanwhile, the government and strike leaders remained at odds in
the six-day-old series of walkouts.
   The slain man was identified as Marvin Alvarado Ponce, an
18-year-old mechanic. Family members said he was shot Friday by two
people on a motorcycle when he was taking part in a street
demonstration.
   Police said they were investigating the case.
   At least four people, not including Alvarado Ponce, were injured
Friday when striking workers clashed with pro-government
demonstrators.
   The demonstration was to generate support for the
Sandinista-supported strikes in which tens of thousands of workers
are calling for more participation in economic policy-making.
   The walkouts are spearheaded by the Sandinista National Labor
Front, a union sympathetic to the leftist Sandinista party. The
party lost Feb. 25 elections to President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   Chamorro's U.S.-backed administration condemned the strike
Friday night, calling it ``political, illegal, illicit and
non-existent.''
   Also Friday night, Finance Minister Emilio Pereira announced a
43 percent salary hike for government workers on lower pay scales.
He also promised to give 65,000 of the government's 100,000-member
workforce cost-of-living raises based on price increases.
   But Front leader Lucio Jimenez said the constant devaluation of
the national currency will counterbalance the raise. ``We have
decided to keep up the strike,'' he said.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales, a member of the government
team negotiating with labor leaders, threatened to fire government
workers who do not show up for work Monday.
   He said police will open closed plant gates and army trucks will
be used to provide transportation.
   Jimenez said 90,000 government and private business employees
joined the walkouts this week.
   They are demanding a new minimum wage, job security, protection
of peasant land distributed under land reforms of the past
Sandinista administration, financing for industrial ventures, and
the opening of new construction projects.

<HEAD>Human Relations Panel Sues Pizza Chain For Refusing to Hire
Bearded Sikh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Human Relations Commission has
charged Domino's Pizza Inc. with religious discrimination for
refusing to hire a Sikh man, whose religion requires him to wear a
beard.
   The nationwide chain has a policy that all employees must be
cleanshaven, but no Maryland health law prohibits food service
employees from having beards.
   The June 28 commission complaint said that Prabhjot S. Kohli, of
Catonsville, was refused employment when he applied for a job as
manager of a Domino's store in December 1987.
   Herb James, personnel director of LOOC Inc., the Domino's
franchise that interviewed Kohli, said the complaint was ``a slap
in the face to us when we are desperately trying to work things out
with this individual.''
   James, quoted in Saturday's Baltimore Sun, said Kohli knew the
dress code and policies when he interviewed for the job and that he
also was unwilling to work the weekend and night hours required. He
said other company jobs that did not involve contact with the
public were available, but Kohli refused to consider them.
   Kohli, now an engineer with the State Highway Administration,
said he applied for the advertised position of senior manager
because he had 18 years' experience as a salesman. He said he was
not interested in the other jobs.
   In its complaint, filed with the state administrative hearing
examiner, the Human Relations Commission asked that Domino's pay
Kohli for two years of lost earnings and that he be hired as a
Domino's manager. The examiner's office will hold a public hearing
later.
   A week ago, the commission won a case that ordered the
University of Maryland to reinstate and pay back pay to a campus
policeman who refused to shave his beard because of a skin
condition.
   That case, decided by a state administrative law judge, involved
charges of racial discrimination because the skin condition,
pseudofolliculitis bearbae, usually afflicts black men. Men with
the ailment suffer scarring and lesions when they shave.

   A European hostage among the 16
Westerners held in Lebanon might be released soon, Iran's official
news agency said Saturday. Sources indicated an Irish captive might
be freed.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by factions of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that receives
financial support from Iran.
   The 47-word report from the Islamic Republic News Agency in
Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was attributed to unidentified
sources. The headline read: ``A European Hostage May Be Released
Soon.''
   ``A Western hostage held in Lebanon will probably be released
soon,'' said the story, monitored in Nicosia.
   Sources would not disclose the identity of the hostage to be
released, but ``hinted that he is most probably a European
national,'' the dispatch said. ``It is not known when and where the
hostage will be released.''
   The hostages are six Americans and 10 Europeans _ four Britons,
two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
Longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Diplomats in Tehran said in recent interviews that Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani has renewed a push to get the 10
European captives in Lebanon freed.
   Earlier this year Iran helped free two American hostages, Robert
Polhill and Frank Reed, then asked for a reciprocal gesture from
the United States. President Bush has said he will not make deals
for captives.
   But an outpouring of Western assistance to Iran after its
devastating June 21 earthquake raised hopes in some quarters that
Iran might again use its influence with the pro-Iranian groups
believed holding the hostages.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has said Iran should be
grateful for the foreign quake aid. However, in comments earlier
this month, he made no link between such aid and the release of any
Western hostages.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Anita Stockman said
Saturday she had no information to confirm the report that another
hostage may soon be released.
   She said the United States provided earthquake aid solely ``as a
humanitarian gesture.''
   While reiterating U.S. policy demanding the unconditional
release of all hostages, she said the hostage issue ``is also a
humanitarian issue.''
   In Beirut, a source close to the Syrian army command said that
if any hostage were released, it probably would be Brian Keenan, an
Irishman who also holds a British passport. Syria is the main power
broker in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war but has little direct
hold over the hostage-takers.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to say
why he thought Keenan might be freed.
   A three-man delegation from Ireland's ruling party visited
Tehran in mid-June. An Irish Red Cross aid plane was the first to
reach Tehran after the quake.
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut April 11, 1986,
as he walked from his home to the American University of Beirut,
where he taught English.
   No group has claimed to be holding Keenan, of Belfast, but Reed
said after his release from captivity in April that he had seen
Keenan.
   ``We are hopeful _ but our hopes have been raised many times
before,'' said Michael Gillham, Keenan's brother-in-law, speaking
from his home in Dundonald, Northern Ireland.
   ``It is looking good for somebody at least to be freed and if
that happens it will be good news, whoever it is,'' he said.
   In Moville, Ireland, Prime Minister Charles Haughey said: ``We
are following developments very closely. I am always hopeful. We
are making a total all-out effort, constantly using every means at
our disposal _ our embassy and friends.''
   Factions within Hezbollah are believed loyal to both
anti-Western and pragmatic camps in the government.
   The pragmatic camp, led by Rafsanjani, has sought improved ties
with the West to help repair Iran's shattered economy. The
hard-line camp believes opposition to the West, especially the
United States, is a cornerstone of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
   But Western diplomats in Tehran interviewed after the earthquake
said quake relief could be an important lever for Rafsanjani in his
quest to free more hostages.
   ``The government wants to solve this crisis,'' one European
diplomat said on condition of anonymity. ``They are trying to find
a way out by making a distinction between the European and American
hostages.''
   He said that focusing on the large amount of earthquake aid sent
by European nations to Iran would help silence domestic opposition
to making conciliatory gestures toward the West.
   ``It could be a way of solving the problem internally,'' the
diplomat said.
   When Polhill and Reed were released earlier this year, the first
word came from IRNA in a short dispatch worded similarly to
Saturday's.
   At that time, Iran said it would work for the release of other
hostages in return for help in gaining freedom for 300 Moslem
prisoners, mostly Lebanese Shiites, held at an Israeli detention
camp in south Lebanon.
   The inmates are accused of involvement in underground warfare
against Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon
Army who control a border strip in south Lebanon.
   Iran also has demanded that Western governments help shed light
on the fate of four Iranians who were kidnapped in 1982 by a
right-wing Lebanese Christian militia in north Lebanon.

   Nelson Mandela said Saturday that
right-wing groups in South Africa are planning a ``bloodbath'' to
prevent black majority rule.
   Mandela was addressing a public rally in Uganda's capital of
Kampala on the third day of his visit to this East African nation
during an international tour.
   ``We know that there are many whites who are armed and
determined to turn our country into a bloodbath,'' Mandela said.
   ``But these are hopeless dreams of people who fail to accept
that majority rule will come to South Africa,'' said the
71-year-old deputy leader of the African National Congress.
   He cited allegations that white right-wing groups were
responsible for a series of six bombings in South African cities
last week.
   The last attack was Friday when a bomb went off in a crowded
black bus terminal, inuring 27 people.
   White extremists claimed responsibility for five blasts, but
there was no claim of responsibility for Friday's bombing.
   Mandela, who arrived here Thursday accompanied by his wife
Winnie, shared the platform with presidents Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Joachim Chissano of
Mozambique.
   Mandela said his organization, the leading group opposing white
rule in South Africa, will strive in forthcoming talks with the
government to create a constitution ending the apartheid system,
the policy of legal racial discrimination.
   ``We will ensure that every person has the right to vote and
serve in all organs of the government,'' he said.
   Mugabe told the cheering crowd the visit had given the four
leaders an opportunity to discuss measures that could hasten the
end of apartheid in South Africa. He said they would present the
ideas to the annual Organization of African Unity summit starting
Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Managers Say Alaska Fire Conditions Worse Than Usual</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSANNE PAGANO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 170 wildfires still raged
across Alaska on Saturday, and fire officials expressed concern the
blazes could threaten small towns for weeks.
   Hot, dry weather _ in tandem with thousands of fire-causing
lightning strikes _ is making the summer fire season much worse
than years past, said Pete Buist, a spokesman for an inter-agency
fire information center at Fairbanks.
   In a more typical summer, tundra and forests would be wetter,
humidity higher, and most fires would be monitored but not
aggressively fought, he said, ``but under the weather conditions we
have now, we start manning fires that we would not ordinarily.''
   Unlike other western states, where policies to let fires burn
have been criticized, Alaska fire managers typically allow most
wildfires to burn because they seldom pose a risk to people or
property.
   No lives or homes have been lost to Alaska fires this year,
authorities said. But massive fires across the state are burning
nearer to villages than usual.
   Throughout Alaska some 2,400 firefighters were battling fires
consuming more than 280,225 acres in a wide east-west band across
the flat tundra and black spruce forests of the sparsely populated
interior.
   The most critical blaze was the 47,000-acre fire near Tok; at
its worst on Thursday, it burned to within a quarter-mile of the
crossroads village on the Alaska Highway, 260 miles northeast of
Anchorage.
   Firefighters on Saturday took advantage of a second consecutive
day of overcast skies, 30 percent humidity and temperatures in the
60s to battle the blaze.
   Rob McWhorter, a Bureau of Land Management spokesman at Tok,
said about 400 firefighters would continue to defend the village of
about 1,000 people, even though the fire posed no danger for now.
   ``The fire is not a direct threat,'' McWhorter said Saturday.
``But the joker in the deck, really, is this cloud cover because
we're told that thunderstorms are imbedded in it.''
   McWhorter said that could create gusting, erratic winds that
could blow the fire near town again.
   The other serious fires included the 910-acre Pedro Dome fire,
15 miles northeast of Fairbanks; the Cassiar Creek fire about 50
miles north of Fairbanks at 2,500 acres; a 33,000-acre blaze near
the village of Beaver, about 100 miles north of Fairbanks; and a
27,000-acre fire touched off by lightning within Denali National
Park.

   Harrah's Headliner Room, one of the last
bastions of big-name entertainment in Reno, will become a
cabaret-lounge next year, featuring a nightly revue.
   Ronald S. Jeffrey, senior vice president and general manager of
Harrah's Reno, announce the change Friday, saying the planned
conversion of the 24-year-old showroom into an ``intimate
nightclub'' in December was a response to a changing entertainment
scene.
   The increasing cost of paying for top-name entertainers and the
difficulty of finding those who will perform two shows nightly
influenced the decision, Jeffrey said.
   The Headliner Room opened with Eddie Fisher as its top act in
1966 and featured such stars as Sammy Davis Jr., Danny Thomas,
Patti Page and Bill Cosby during its heyday.
   After its conversion, the room will stay roughly the same size,
seating 400 to 450 people.
   The loss of the Headliner Room will leave the Reno area with
only three stages designed for top-name acts _ Bally's, the Sparks
Nugget and The Flamingo Hilton.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service had been
examining the records of Mitch Snyder for a year prior to his
apparent suicide last week, an attorney for the homeless advocate
said Saturday.
   The attorney, Gerald A. Kafka, said the IRS ``stepped in'' about
a year ago to audit royalties paid to Snyder from the 1986
television movie, ``Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story.'' Snyder was
a consultant on the film.
   ``The IRS was examining civilly Mitch's tax liability for prior
years. ... It was the audit of any taxpayer and the IRS wasn't
handling it any differently,'' Kafka said in a telephone interview.
   Ellen Murphy, director of public affairs for the IRS, said
Saturday the agency was proibited from commenting.
   The body of Snyder, 46, was found hanging by an electrical cord
Thursday in his bedroom at the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
the Washington homeless shelter he ran.
   Authorities said Snyder apparently had killed himself one or two
days earlier. Kafka said he had scheduled a meeting with Snyder for
last Tuesday evening to ``wrap up'' the IRS situation, but ``he
didn't make the meeting.''
   Police found a note near Snyder's body in which he talked about
problems with his relationship with Carol Fennelly, his longtime
companion and co-worker at the shelter. The two had planned to
marry in September.
   Fennelly was scheduled for admission to Capitol Hill Hospital
after she collapsed outside the CCNV shelter during a meeting of
the homeless advocacy group on Saturday. Hospital spokeswoman Lisa
Poulter said doctors advised Fennelly be admitted for observation
but she decided to leave.
   Police sources last week who described the note did not say if
it mntioned any difficulties with the IRS.
   Snyder had refused, for philosophical reasons, to incorporate
his shelter as a tax-exempt group. Kafka would not say whether
Snyder had refused to pay taxes.
   ``It's safe to say Mitch was very consistent in his treatment of
taxes,'' Kafka said.
   ``Mitch did not gain any economic advantage from the movie,''
the attorney said. ``The money went straight to CCNV.''
   According to a report in Saturday editions of The New York
Times, Snyder told co-workers six weeks ago about the audit.
   Members of the District of Columbia City Council had criticized
Snyder for failing to apply officially for non-profit status.
Council members complained that Snyder's group received $360,000 a
year in free utilities for which the city could not be reimbursed
because of the shelter's refusal to seek official status.
   Tax-exempt status limits the ability of an organization to
engage in political activity. Snyder had been known for his
political activism and he had been highly critical of the city's
management of its homeless program.

   State television broadcast footage of a
purported 1980 meeting between an international terrorist and
agents of the old Communist regime, bolstering claims the ex-rulers
let terrorists use Hungary as a base.
   A former Communist official interviewed on the same program
claimed the Communists had tried to oust Carlos as soon as they
discovered he was operating in the country.
   The footage purportedly showed agents of the old regime trying
to persuade the international terrorist Carlos to leave Hungary.
The nation's Communist Party disbanded in October.
   However, it appeared to back up allegations made three weeks ago
that Hungary's former Communist leaders had allowed Carlos to use
the country, at least for a time, as a base for terrorist attacks.
   The report did not indicate how long Carlos, also known as ``The
Jackal,'' allegedly stayed in Hungary.
   Carlos, a Moscow University graduate, began his life as a
terrorist in 1973 and topped Interpol's most-wanted list by 1975.
In December of that year, he allegedly organized an attack in
Vienna on OPEC oil ministers in which three people were killed.
Carlos remains at large.
   State television said the meeting shown in the film took place
in 1980 in an office of the Interior Ministry's Department for the
Supervision of Foreigners and was filmed without Carlos's knowledge.
   There was no indication of how the film was obtained.
   Interior Minister Balazs Horvath said on June 27 that he had
instructed the chief prosecutor to investigate former Communist
Party officials who allegedly provided shelter and training grounds
for Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and his
terrorist group.
   The man identified as Carlos in the film spoke fluent but
accented English.
   The two Hungarian agents spoke Hungarian among themselves and
English to Carlos. The conversation was poorly recorded and
difficult to make out at times, so the film was subtitled.
   One agent told Carlos that he ``must liquidate your base of
operations here, must stop using Hungary from where to direct your
group because there is danger. Your operations may be compromised.
   ``Also, if you were to continue, the interests of the Hungarian
People's Republic may be jeopardized if you are associated with
us.''
   ``You can travel through Hungary or even stay for brief
periods,'' the Hungarian official told Carlos, trying to mollify
him.
   Andras Petresevics, one of the agents, said in an interview on
the program that the terrorist accused him of being an
``imperialist agent'' and of acting without the knowledge of his
superiors to get him to leave.
   The former Communist chief of counterintelligence, Miklos Redei,
also was interviewed in the program. Redei, who also met Carlos,
said: ``He gave the impression of being paranoid, afraid _ but he
was not dumb.''
   Horvath, speaking about the case last month, said recently
discovered documents implicated the late Communist Party leader,
Janos Kadar; former Interior Minister Andras Benkei; former
President Karoly Nemeth; and Antal Gyenes, former head of the
Communist Party's foreign relations department.
   One of the documents produced by Horvath was a letter allegedly
written to Kadar by Carlos in 1980, the same year the terrorist
apparently left Hungry.
   ``From our base in Hungary, we have developed our international
ties, getting in contact with the revolutions of every nation
without any hindrance on the part of the Hungarian authorities,''
the letter purportedly said.
   Benkei, Nemeth and Gyenes have denied any role in sheltering
terrorists.
   Redei asserted that a small group of terrorists led by Carlos
``did not come here at the invitation of any Hungarian official. We
tried to keep tabs on them after their arrival.''
   Redei denied Carlos was provided with any training facilities in
Hungary.
   He said fear of the terrorist kept Hungarian authorities from
acting against him. ``We ... knew that if we do anything to him,
his group would take revenge.''

<TEXT>
   From the sugar fields of Cuba to the shores of
the Kurile islands, the ghost of Josef Stalin is haunting Mikhail
Gorbachev's effort to win economic aid from the West.
   With Gorbachev's survival at stake, Western nations are flirting
with a $15 billion economic aid package to Moscow _ an issue that
is likely to dominate the economic summit of industrialized nations
that begins here on Monday.
   Bush received a recent message from Gorbachev and it was learned
Saturday that the Soviet leader made his case for U.S. assistance.
It was virtually the same request that Gorbachev conveyed within
the last two weeks to leaders of West Germany and France.
   West Germany, France and Italy are eager to proceed, but
Gorbachev may have to reverse decades-old Soviet policy before the
United States and Japan will go along. No one is expecting a
consensus from this summit.
   The sticking points for the United States: Soviet assistance to
Cuba, and modernization of the Red Army.
   For Japan: four Kurile islands seized by Stalin after World War
II.
   After ridiculing the notion earlier in the year, President Bush
seems to be slowly setting the stage for direct American aid to
Moscow. But it isn't going to happen now, he indicated on Friday.
   ``I have some big problems with that one, and I think the
American people do, too,'' President Bush told reporters after the
NATO summit in London. He said commercial trade credits might be
possible, but that the United States will not provide direct aid so
long as the Soviet Union sends $5 billion a year to prop up the
Cuban economy.
   Perhaps more importantly, Bush also urged Gorbachev to scale
back the percentage of Soviet spending devoted to the military.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III says Moscow has been spending
between 18 and 25 percent of its economy ``on military expansion,
which in the past has been hostile to the United States.''
   Baker also said, ``We really ought to see some progress toward
economic reforms'' before sending American taxpayer funds to
Moscow. ``We ought to have some faith that the money will be well
spent,'' he told CNN.
   One obstacle dates back past Stalin to the Czarist days. It is a
legal restriction on credit to the Soviet Union based on
pre-revolutionary debt of several hundred million dollars.
   On Cuba, Bush is stating an American political reality: The
United States isn't going to subsidize Moscow so that Moscow can
subsidize Cuba.
   Soviet economic aid to Cuba is estimated by U.S. officials at
more than $4 billion a year, mostly in the form of subsidies for
Cuban exports such as sugar. Cuba receives an additional $1.5
billion in military aid, according to U.S. figures.
   Aid-to-Cuba is already the subject of heated debate in Moscow
where some argue that it would be wrong to turn on an ally under
threat from the United States. Others say the Kremlin cannot
justify a large-scale aid program at a time of economic decline at
home.
   Japan is joining Bush in using the economic aid question as a
wedge to reverse long-held Soviet policies. The Japanese are
keeping their prodigious wallets zipped pending the outcome of a
peace treaty that involves the Kurile chain of islands.
   In an interview shortly before leaving for Houston, Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said it was ``Soviet expansionism at
the end of World War II'' that prompted Stalin to seize four of the
Kurile islands from Japan.
   He told The New York Times that economic aid to Gorbachev ``will
not be possible'' until the northern territories conflict is
resolved. Despite warming relations between Japan and the Soviet
Union, a resolution will be none too simple, since the islands _
Etorofu, Kunashira, Shikotan and Habomai _ are not the only or even
the most prominent territories seized by Stalin.
   While Japan is playing hardball on aid to Moscow, Kaifu also is
carrying the torch for resumption of Western aid to China. It's
possible Japan will lift its sanctions against China even if the
other summit nations do not. Bush allowed as much on Saturday,
saying, ``Sometimes there are interests that predominate.''
   Japan sees China as a huge and natural market and is anxious to
proceed with a $5 billion aid package.
   West Germany's effort to win aid for Moscow also seems to have a
self-serving edge.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said in a recent commentary
that Bonn was trying to ``grease'' the way for Soviet approval of
the key tenets of German unification.
   Despite his best efforts, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
says the issue may not come to a head until the end of the year.
   ``We are not under time pressure,'' he told reporters in London
on Friday.
   Not under time pressure? Gorbachev said last week that if the
Soviet economy isn't awakening within two years, he'll give way.
With the ghost of Stalin still complicating international affairs,
no one in the West is eager for that to happen.

   About 250 demonstrators Saturday jeered more than
100 Ku Klux Klan members as they marched outside Rice University,
where the International Economic Summit will begin Monday.
   Police made a few arrests but there was no serious trouble at
the two-hour protest.
   Charles Lee, the Texas KKK grand dragon, led Klansmen in
chanting, ``No Economic Summit,'' and ``Bush should not negotiate
with foreign countries.''
   The Klansmen arrived in school buses, carrying banners saying,
``Stop Colored Immigration,'' and began their rally with a prayer
by a minister from the Aryan Nation Church.
   Demonstrators interrupted the Klan's activities with chants.
   As the rally winded down, one protestor, Travis Morales, who
heads the Revolutionary Communist Party, was arrested along with
two other anti-Klan demonstrators as they burned an American flag,
police said.
   KTBC-TV cameraman Andrew Sowder of Austin and Associated Press
photographer Greg Gibson were arrested for crossing the police
line. Police later released the two after ticketing them for the
misdemeanor.
   About 15 Klan supporters calling themselves ``skinheads''
marched in front of angry demonstrators before the Klan arrived.
The anti-Klan contingent threw dog food at the skinheads, shouting,
``Dog food for the dogs.''
   Members of the AIDS-advocacy group ACT UP, members of Cure AIDS
Now, Students And Youth Against Racism and the All Peoples'
Congress taunted the Klansmen.
   Hundreds of police officers wore 50-pound flak jackets and riot
helmets in sweltering 90-degree heat while standing between
Klansmen and demonstrators.
   Earlier, on the steps of Houston's city hall, a group calling
itself Racial Acceptance, Class Equality, or RACE, sang songs and
spoke out against racism to drown the messages of the Klan rally.
   ``The KKK's rally is irrelevant,'' said Jim Greenwood, a Houston
city council member who spoke in support of RACE. ``The KKK has
nothing to do with anything real in Houston today.''
   About 50 people attended the rally held by RACE, which was
founded last year as a voice for white people against racism, but
now includes members from various ethnic backgrounds. It was the
first public demonstration by the group, RACE president Sue Lloyd
said.
   ``We want to stress to the world that Houston is a diverse,
interesting place and while we are not perfect, we are committed to
racial harmony,'' she said.
   Across the street, more than 400 Vietnamese from across the
country carried signs and chanted in support for human rights in
their native land.
   Some of the 30 banners painted in the red and yellow of the
Vietnamese flag included slogans like ``Freedom For Vietnam,'' and
``Don't Support the Hanoi Regime.''
   Hang Nguyen Diep, an organizer of the rally, said the Vietnamese
were attempting to gather support from the world leaders attending
the summit.

   Western leaders, gathering for back-to-back
summits, shifted continents Saturday to take up a series of tough
economic issues and mull the encouraging reaction from Moscow to
changes in the NATO military alliance.
   President Bush welcomed his guests in the sweltering heat of his
adopted hometown and met over a pre-summit lunch with Toshiki
Kaifu, the prime minister of Japan.
   Their discussions touched on several of the most difficult
issues that would arise Monday when the formal summit meetings
begin: aid to Moscow, loans to China and trade among the allies
themselves. Bush hinted that he wouldn't try to block Kaifu's
intention to resume economic aid to China.
   The prospering allies were trying to map a coordinated strategy
to deal with the breakup of the communist bloc. The 16th annual
economic summit meeting is the first held in America since a
gathering in Williamsburg, Va. in 1983.
   A decision on sending aid to Moscow was not expected to emerge
this week, but the climate was growing more hospitable and Bush's
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said of the summit leaders: ``There
are a lot of things they can consider short of direct aid.''
   Bush told Kaifu, according to Fitzwater, ``that he was very
pleased with the reaction of the Soviet Union to the NATO summit.
We have read the reports of comments by President Gorbachev as well
as Foreign Minister (Eduard) Shevardnadze and we are very pleased
that they believe that the NATO summit has been productive and
helpful.''
   Fitzwater disclosed that Bush sent Mikhail Gorbachev a cable
Friday from Air Force One giving Bush's ``personal reflections'' on
the NATO summit and describing ``the changing nature of the
(military) alliance.''
   Previously, Gorbachev wrote Bush to make his case for U.S.
economic aid. U.S. sources said the message was much the same as
one Gorbachev advanced recently to the leaders of West Germany and
France.
   The Bush-Kaifu meeting also touched on American domestic
policies with the Japanese leader praising Bush for new-found
willingness to consider tax increases in order to reduce America's
budget deficit, a Japanese official said.
   ``We believe the statement issued by President Bush on June 26
was very courageous,'' Taizo Watanabe, spokesman for the Japanese
finance ministry, told reporters.
   The federal budget deficits have long been a sore point with
other summit countries, who contend that excessive American
borrowing needs have driven up worldwide interest rates.
   In addition to the United States and Japan, the other countries
at the economic summit are West Germany, Britian, France, Italy and
Canada.
   The world leaders were not spending all of their time discussing
serious subjects. Bush was treating the summit leaders to a
country-style barbecue, rodeo and performance by the Grand Ole Opry
on Sunday.
   The city of Houston, anxious to show the world that it had
rebounded after being flattened by the oil bust of 1982, raised $10
million in donations and turned out an army of volunteers to assist
visiting dignitaries and reporters.
   Last year's economic summit was held in Paris as part of the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution. While Houston boosters
conceded that the Houston summit would not top that affair, they
did try their best _ providing a Texas-syle welcome for each leader.
   Kaifu, the first to arrive, was greeted by a group of
schoolchildren singing ``Deep in the Heart of Texas'' _ in
Japanese. With temperatures in the 90s and oppressive humidity,
Kaifu and the other leaders had no trouble knowing they had arrived
in Houston.
   Before the start of his meeting with Kaifu, Bush was asked
whether he planned to pressure the Japanese leader to drop his push
to resume development loans to China. This assistance was put on
hold by agreement of the summit countries last year in Paris in
response to the brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in
Tiananmen Square.
   Bush indicated that the summit countries are likely to abandon
their united front, providing Japan the opportunity to pursue its
own lending policy.
   Japan, Bush said, ``is a sovereign nation. They can make up
their own minds on a lot of questions.''
   The go-it-separately approach was also likely to prevail on the
contentious question over whether to provide direct economic aid to
the Soviet Union. West Germany has already announced it will
provide $3.1 billion in loans and economic assistance.
   West Germany, France and Italy have been pushing the allies to
endorse a $15 billion economic aid package to bail out the
floundering Soviet economy. But the United States and Britain
opposed providing direct economic aid until the Soviets made a
bolder move toward a free-market economy and stopped siphoning
large amounts of its resources into the military and support for
Cuba.
   Japan has its own special problem with Soviet aid, contending
Japanese assistance would be impossible until Moscow has settled a
45-year-old territorial dispute over four islands north of Japan
that have been occupied by the Soviet Union since World War II.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday that the
summit, scheduled to run from Monday through Wednesday, was likely
to conclude without a common position on Soviet aid.
   Baker for the first time Saturday discussed publicly a new U.S.
proposal to establish a multibillion-dollar international aid
program for Latin America.
   While details of the plan are sketchy, it would be modeled after
the economic aid package being offered to emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe with the assistance coming from the same Group of 24
nations who are providing aid to Eastern Europe.
   The Latin American aid would be another effort by the Bush
administration to reassure new democratic governments in this
hemisphere that they will not be overlooked in the rush to help
Eastern Europe.
   The United States received a warning Saturday from an official
of the 12-nation European Community that its heavy lobbying on
elimination of farm subsidies could be counterproductive.
   The United States is in a battle with European countries over a
U.S. proposal to phase out expensive farm subsidies over the next
decade. Europeans contend that the request could cost the jobs of
between 2 million and 3 million less-efficient European farmers.
   Bush has made resolution of the farm dispute a top priority for
the Houston summit, believing that agreement in this area is
crucial to the successful conclusion of 97-nation effort to
overhaul the entire world trading system. Those talks, known as the
Uruguay Round, are scheduled to conclude in December.

   The Bush administration will not object if Japan
resumes aid to China despite continued U.S. economic sanctions in
reprisal for Beijing's crushing of the pro-democracy revolt, the
White House said Saturday.
   President Bush was not prepared to enter a multinational
aid-to-China agreement but was ``willing to discuss the matter,''
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. He said Bush wanted to hear
Japan's explanation of why it plans a $5.2 billion loan package to
its giant neighbor.
   A Japanese spokesman said Bush did not react negatively when
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu raised that matter during their
meeting Saturday.
   Japan already is doing ``preparatory work'' on the loan it
suspended after China's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement
last year, Japanese foreign ministry press secretary Taizo Watanabe
said Saturday.
   Contrary to earlier reports, he said ``it is not on our mind''
to push for other summit countries to similarly aid China.
   Bush, hosting the summit of wealthy industrialized nations
beginning here Monday, told reporters that Japan is a ``sovereign
nation'' that can make up its own mind ``on a lot of questions.''
He was replying to a reporter's question on whether he would urge
Kaifu to refrain from resuming aid to China.
   ``They work very cooperatively with the United States, but
sometimes they have interests that predominate,'' Bush said before
going to his meeting and luncheon with Kaifu.
   Most non-communist nations imposed sanctions on Beijing after
the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square last year against hundreds
of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   However, Bush has backed away from a totally hard line on the
China question, sending high level emissaries to begin opening the
way to eventual renewed relations, easing some parts of the
sanctions, and stating that he does not believe such an important
geopolitical giant should be isolated.
   Later, Fitzwater was asked about whether Bush would try to
dissuade Kaifu from going ahead with renewed aid to China.
   He replied: ``No. We'll listen to their discussion and see what
their interests are.''
   Asked specifically whether Bush objected to other countries
resuming aid to China, he said, ``We're willing to discuss it.
That's what this summit is all about.''
   As to why Bush wouldn't pressure Japan or other countries to
hold firm against China, given the administration's official
position that China must show progress on human rights and
political freedom, Fitzwater told reporters: ``We do have concerns
about multilateral lending in China. On the other hand, various
countries have other interests that are outside the multilateral
area. We're willing to talk about that. ... We are not looking to
change our position, but we're willing to discuss the matter. We
are concerned about China and not isolating that country, but I
don't anticipate any change.''
   Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party chief said the leaders of
the seven industrialized powers should avoid meddling in China's
internal affairs at their annual economic summit.
   Jiang Zemin said the Group of Seven should ``confine themselves
to discussion of economic and other issues among themselves,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said in a report Saturday that it said
paraphrased his remarks.
   Regardless of the reaction of other summit participants,
officials have indicated Japan likely would go ahead with its own
loan plan to Beijing.
   At last year's summit in France, the participants agreed on
sanctions including a ban on high-level contacts with Chinese
officials and a freeze on development loans.
   Japan has been China's main source of credit and had planned
$5.2 billion in a five-year program of loans. Now, Kaifu and other
Japanese government officials say, it's time to open the credit
window again to avoid isolating China or contributing to economic
unrest there.
   Bush said he had a ``wide array'' of issues to discuss with
Kaifu.
   The included economic and trade issues, and the ongoing Uruguay
Round of trade talks, as well as environmental and agricultural
issues. The two countries concluded this year an agreement on
thorny trade talks designed to correct the massive U.S. trade
deficit with Japan. The idea would be to reform institutional
economic practices that make it harder for U.S. interests to
compete in Japan.
   Bush and his wife Barbara later took Kaifu to a Houston
production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Carousel.''
   The musical was added to Bush's summit-week activities after
members of the city's host committee insisted that the cultural
side of the city be highlighted. The centerpiece social activity
before this week's addition of the Carousel show at the Wortham
Theater Center had been the Sunday nights rodeo, barbecue and Grand
Ole Opry performance.
   Bush's attendance at the Houston Grand Opera performance of
Carousel ``shows that Houston is a city of wide cultural
diversity,'' said Peter Roussel, spokesman for the Houston Host
Committee.
   The performance was to have closed last week, but was extended
with three performances this weekend.

<HEAD>Former Duvalierist Leader Returns to Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The former head of a dreaded
paramilitary force under the deposed Duvalier regime returned to
the country from voluntary exile Saturday, a radio report said.
   The announcement heightened the fears of some presidential
candidates that the ex-minister of defense and the interior, Roger
Lafontant, intends to disrupt upcoming elections.
   Lafontant arrived on a regularly scheduled flight from the
Dominican Republic, according to Radio Haiti-Inter. He had been
living in exile there since 1986.
   Government prosecutor Bayard Vincent said in an interview with
the independent radio station that police were ordered to arrest
Lafontant.
   But airport authorities countermanded the order, said Defense
and Interior Minister Joseph Maxi. He said it was unconstitutional
to deport a Haitian citizen.
   ``Lafontant's return is part of a concerted Duvalierist
offensive to spoil the electoral process and seize the reins of
power,'' said presidential candidate Sylvio Claude, leader of the
Haitian Christian Democrat Party.
   In a telephone interview with independent Radio-Antilles,
Lafontant said his re-entry was legal and denied he had returned to
interfere with the electoral process. ``There is no place like
home,'' he said.
   Elections are tentatively set for Nov. 4. There has been an
upsurge in political violence in this Caribbean country since the
Independent Electoral Council was established May 2 to prepare for
free elections.
   The last elections, held on Nov. 29, 1987, failed when
army-supported squads shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters.
If successful, the new elections would be the first free balloting
since Haiti won independence from France in 1804.
   Lafontant led a dreaded paramilitary group called the Tonton
Macoutes. He was considered the power behind ruler Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier before the dictator's ouster in February 1986.
   On Friday, the Independent Electoral Council denounced the
re-emergence in public the day before of ex-Brig. Gen. Williams
Regala, who allegedly masterminded the 1987 voter massacre when he
was defense and interior minister.
   The Electoral Council called Regala's return a grave danger to
the electoral process. Human-rights groups, popular organizations,
labor unions and political parties also expressed worry.
   Regala was seen on television Friday at the funeral of former
Lt. Col. Paul Rosny Casimir, who was shot to death by unknown
assailants June 28.
   Regala was retired from the army in 1988 and had lived in Haiti
and the United States since then.
   Haiti is ruled by a caretaker government led by former judge
Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, who shares power with the 19-member Council
of State. She took over in March after a popular uprising toppled
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.

<HEAD>Vatican Newspaper Assails N.Y. State Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Vatican newspaper Saturday
assailed a ``right-to-die'' bill passed by the New York state
legislature this month.
   L'Osservatore Romano, in a front-page editorial, said the
Catholic Church ``denounces the alliance that man makes today with
death.''
   It called such laws ``simple acts of tragic stupidity.''
   The newspaper did not specifically mention New York but clearly
alluded to the legislation approved earlier this month in Albany.
   The bill allows the sick to appoint proxies to make health-care
decisions for them when they are no longer able to do so. The
ruling opens the possibility of a proxy deciding that an
incapacitated person should be allowed to die.
   The legislation was passed after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
that a Missouri woman in an irreversible coma could not be
disconnected from life-support equipment because it was unclear
what her wishes would have been.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Roman Catholic, has not yet signed
the bill into law but is expected to do so.
   ``Abortion and euthanasia express the same idea: that human life
belongs exclusively to man and that everyone is the exclusive owner
of his life,'' the editorial said.
   The newspaper said only God had the right to terminate life.
   ``If even the people who are asked to wisely govern the human
community have fallen into such blackness as to promulgate such
anti-human laws, the culture and mentality of the end of the
century have lost their sense of authentic values,'' the editorial
said.
   In a last-minute concession aimed at avoiding the active
opposition of New York state's Roman Catholic bishops, legislators
said private hospitals could refuse, for moral or religious
reasons, to carry out a proxy order to end life support.
   The hospital would, however, have to inform the patient upon
admission that it would not honor a proxy's decision.

   The search for any remaining victims of
last month's flooding has ended with the death count at 26,
officials said Saturday.
   ``We got together this morning to discuss the ramifications of
suspending the search and whether everything had been done. We
decided it was time to end it,'' said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County
coroner's investigator. ``I'm satisfied that everything that could
have been done was done.''
   Funerals for the last two victims, whose bodies were found
Thursday, were held Saturday, Vogt said.
   Seven names remained on the list of those believed missing since
the June 14 flood on the outskirts of this eastern Ohio village,
but Vogt said officials now believe those people were not in the
area at the time.
   Floodwaters and debris hurtled down Wegee and Pipe creeks the
night of the flood, leaving hundreds of people homeless.
   The cleanup around the creeks will continue, Vogt said. Several
miles along both creeks has yet to been cleared of debris.

   A prominent state legislator has been
convicted of conspiracy for inducing a former prison mate to invest
in an illegal bingo operation, then fleecing him of half the money.
   A 12-member jury convicted state Rep. Tommy Burnett on Friday of
nine conspiracy counts that carry a possible prison term of 45
years.No sentencing date was set by U.S. District Judge Thomas A.
Higgins.
   Two co-defendants, Columbia businessman E.E. Shutt and Knoxville
bingo operator Virginia Hurst, were convicted on charges of
conspiracy and operating a gambling enterprise.
   Burnett faces trial Sept. 11 on a related perjury charge.
   The convictions were the first to result from a joint
federal-state corruption probe that has produced indictments
against 43 people, including a former state representative, an
election commissioner, a bingo regulator and various bingo
operators.
   The investigation has centered on misuse of profits from bingo,
which had been permitted in the state only to benefit charities,
and was made illegal altogether in 1989, partly as a result of the
investigation.
   While Burnett was serving 10 months of a federal prison sentence
in 1984, the indictment charged, he convinced fellow inmate Joseph
Cappello, of Naples, Fla., to invest $48,000 in the operation of a
Crossville bingo home.
   Burnett, Hurst and Shutt created the Columbia Scholarship Fund
as a non-profit charter to run the bingo hall in 1985, after
Burnett left prison. But the hall operated only briefly, and
Burnett made private use of about half of Cappello's investment,
according to testimony.
   Burnett, the once-powerful majority leader in the state House of
Representatives, apparently will lose his seat as a result of the
conviction. Felons are barred from the office.
   The 10-term legislator was re-elected in 1984 from the federal
prison camp in Alabama, where he was sent for failing to file
timely income tax returns.
   Burnett earned a reputation early in his career as a powerful
speaker and champion of sometimes unpopular causes: He once
presented an eloquent attack on Tennessee's death penalty.
   After the tax conviction, which plea bargaining reduced to a
misdemeanor, Burnett surrendered the party leadership and became a
mediator, helping forge compromise on such issues as education
reform.
   ``All good things must come to an end and perhaps this is the
end of it, I don't know,'' Burnett said after the conviction Friday.
   Burnett said he would not seek re-election but that he hadn't
decided whether he would resign. He had previously filed for
re-election and has two opponents in the August primary.
   ``I wish I'd never taken a look at bingo, obviously,'' Burnett
said. ``Hindsight is 20-20.''

<HEAD>Insurer Cites Blood Fraud in Refusing to pay AIDS Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance company is refusing to
pay a $2 million life insurance claim to the survivor of an AIDS
victim, saying the victim used someone else's blood to qualify for
coverage.
   Lawyers for Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co. want a
federal judge in Fort Lauderdale to throw out the $2 million claim
by Anthony C. Fioretti, who died of AIDS on Feb. 28, 1989, in
Broward County.
   Fioretti, 40, tested positive for the HIV virus and was rejected
by another insurance company less than a month before virus-free
blood was used in his application to Massachusetts General, the
lawyers say.
   ``The person submitting blood for HIV testing on (June 29, 1987)
was not in fact Fioretti, but represented himself and his blood
sample to be that of Fioretti,'' the suit says.
   Fioretti also used the name ``Finetti'' on the application to
make it more difficult for insurance investigators to discover
through national computer records he had previously tested positive
for AIDS, the suit says.
   Despite the proliferation of AIDS cases nationwide, the
Massachusetts General lawsuit is one of only a handful of cases
filed in federal court involving AIDS victims accused of trying to
enrich survivors through fraudulent insurance claims, according to
a report in Saturday's Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.
   Fioretti, a former New York City florist, had been paying
$30,365 per year in premiums to maintain his $2 million insurance
coverage since July 1987. The sole beneficiary was listed as
Fioretti's brother, Vincent, of Plantation, who has an unlisted
phone number and could not be located for comment.
   Last month, Fort Lauderdale attorney Steven Fine filed suit on
behalf of Vincent Fioretti to force Massachusetts General to pay
the $2 million claim. Calls to Fine's office went unanswered
Saturday.
   Mark F. Hughes Jr., an attorney for Massachusetts General in
Newark, N.J., said the company _ in accordance with insurance laws
_ has offered to refund Fioretti's premium payments, with interest,
to his brother. The offer was rejected, he said.
   Hughes said the insurance company has filed a countersuit in
federal court in New York City, where the blood tests were
performed, asking the court to dismiss Fioretti's claim.
   ``How do we know that an imposter submitted the blood?,'' Hughes
asked rhetorically. ``We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
Fioretti died of AIDS. We know that AIDS does not kill you
immediately so he had to have had it before his death. And we know
that in January 1987 his blood tested positive for HIV.''
   If the company knew he had the AIDS virus, Massachusetts General
would have never issued the policy, he said. The suit argues that
because of alleged fraudulent acts by Fioretti, his application was
void before it was accepted.

<HEAD>Soviet Circus Files For U.S. Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet circus stranded outside Atlanta since
May has filed for protection from its creditors under U.S.
bankruptcy laws.
   The Great Circus Bim Bom filed for Chapter 11 protection Friday
in Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta, said lawyer Richard Keck, who is
donating his services.
   The circus, named for two turn-of-the-century Russian clowns,
has been stranded in Marietta, northwest of Atlanta, when its
planned two-year goodwill tour of the United States was canceled
after investors withdrew support.
   Circus members have been forced to live on charity, unable to
restart their tour because they can't pay the companies holding
their performing animals, costumes and equipment. They blame a
Florida company, International Showbusiness Inc., for improperly
managing their tour.
   The bankruptcy action would consolidate claims and lawsuits
against the circus so it can straighten out its finances, Keck
said. Two lawsuits have been filed against the circus in New York
and Georgia by the equipment companies, he said.
   ``Instead of having to defend it on a lot of battlefronts, this
consolidates it down to one,'' Keck said.
   ``The situation right now is very optimistic for us,'' said
circus managing director Yuri Turkin.
   About 70 circus members remain in the Atlanta area. Some 30
others stayed with International Showbusiness and traveled to West
Virginia to look for work.

<HEAD>United States Would Consider Role for Afghan Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States is willing to
consider a role for Afghanistan's Soviet-backed leader in a
settlement to end the nation's 10-year-old war, diplomatic sources
said Saturday.
   Diplomatic formulas recently drafted by Washington could provide
the United States and the Soviet Union with a face-saving exit from
war between Moslem rebels and the Afghan government, the sources
said.
   The options include what a year ago would have been out of the
question for the United States _ allowing President Najibullah to
remain in office while transferring control of the armed forces,
the intelligence agencies and the state-run media to a broad-based
interim council, the sources said.
   The options also include internationally supervised elections
and a cutoff of weapons supplied by the United States to the rebels
and by the Soviet Union to the government in Kabul.
   The proposed compromise comes as the Soviet Union is tiring of
its costly involvement in Afghanistan and the United States
becoming increasingly frustrated by internal bickering that has
sapped the Moslem resistance of its political and military cohesion.
   ``We believe the Soviets are seriously interested in reaching a
political solution. We certainly are. So there are a lot of forces
moving, and we have made a lot of progress,'' said a senior U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Although the mechanics have yet to be worked out, the emergence
of independent Afghan groups could provide the springboard for an
interim council.
   The council would most likely include Najibullah's ruling
Hezb-e-Watan, or Party of the Homeland, which until last month had
been known for a quarter century as the People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan.
   The major obstacle to a settlement has been Najibullah, the
44-year-old ruler and former head of the feared Afghan secret
police who has been trying to distance himself and his party from
the Communist past.
   Until recently, Washington had insisted that Najibullah and
``less than a planeload'' of people had to leave. But Najibullah
has proven a formidable politician and refused to step aside.
Moscow has said it cannot remove him.
   ``He can stay and sign the checks. He can call himself by
whatever title he wishes. He can run in an election and if he wins,
he can return to power,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``He just can't have the advantages of incumbency _ control of
the military, the police and the media _ before or during an
election, because he would probably cheat,'' the diplomat said.
   Rebel leaders said thay have been informed of the U.S. proposal.
   ``If Najib stays as president _ if only in title _ then
symbolically and psychologically he has won,'' said one guerrilla
leader, also speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But if the
Soviets and the Americans come to any agreement, then it's
settled.''
   When the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan in February 1989
after nine years of direct involvement, Western leaders confidently
predicted that the government would quickly fall and the resistance
would take command.
   However, neither side has achieved any significant military
victory. Government troops control the cities, and the guerrillas
remain in control of the countryside.

<HEAD>Three Great Opera Tenors Declare Ego Timeout for Soccer, Charity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the greatest tenors in opera _ Luciano
Pavarotti Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras _ proved they are also
good sports Saturday by taking the stage together to sing during
World Cup soccer festivities.
   The booming voices of the trio _ perhaps the world's most famous
tenors _ echoed amid the brick ruins of Rome's Baths of Caracalla
on the eve of World Cup championship. Argentina and West Germany
will play the final match Sunday in Rome.
   A golden full moon rose as the charity concert was put on hold
until the last kick in Saturday evening's consolation match between
Italy and England. Italy won, helping the great Italian tenor
Pavarotti get keyed up for singing.
   ``Vincero, vincero, vincero,'' (I shall win), sang Pavarotti,
the final line of Nessun Dorma from ``Turandot,'' ending his last
solo.
   Any rivalries among the tenors, however, were declared
out-of-bounds for the evening. To avoid bruising egos, they came on
the stage in alphabetical order and took turns singing opera arias.
   They then joined together at the end for a 20-minute medly of
popular songs, including ``Maria'' from ``West Side Story,''
``Memory'' from the musical ``Cats,'' ``La Vie en Rose'' and ``O
Sole Mio.''
   The trio then broke into a second round of the same medley for
an encore. ``Now we're warmed up,'' joked Domingo.
   However, the singers and maestro Zubin Mehta, who led the two
orchestras, had been basking all evening in mutual admiration and
the cheers of the audience.
   When the concert ended, Mehta stepped off the podium to embrace
Carreras and Domingo together. Then he gave Pavarotti a bear hug.
   The concert organizers had promised that air traffic from nearby
Leonardo da Vinci Airport would be diverted from above the
1,800-year-old baths, which were built by Emperor Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus.
   But Carreras had just begun the first aria _ Francesco Cilea's
``Lamento di Federico'' _ when the first jet roared overhead. When
another jet gave him some competition, Carreras looked up and blew
it a kiss.
   Pavarotti said he was donating his share of proceeds to several
charities to fight diseases. Domingo, who grew up in Mexico, will
give his share to Mexican villages devastated in an 1985
earthquake. Carreras, who was cured of leukemia, will donate his
proceeds toward work on that disease.
   With only 6,000 seats, opera lovers vied with VIPs for tickets.
The Italian news agency AGI reported Queen Beatrice of the
Netherlands and Sofia of Spain, Carreras' home country, were among
the lucky ones.
   Former Premier Giovanni Spadolini, now Senate president,
reportedly left in a huff because he didn't like his third-row seat.
   A helicopter carried Rome Mayor Franco Carraro to the capital
from Bari, where he had watched the Italy-England match with
Premier Giulio Andreotti.
   Also attending were Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary
of state; and U.S. Ambassador to Italy Peter Secchia.

   They said details of the accident were not released until the
crash site was found Saturday morning. Heavy rains in the area had
hampered search efforts, they said.
   A man, two women and a child who survived the crash were found

<HEAD>Two Lutheran Congregations On Trial Over Gay Ordinations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Lutheran pastors and their
congregations went on trial before an ecclesiastical panel Saturday
for defying church rules and ordaining a gay man and a lesbian
couple.
   The hearing, the first of its kind for the fledgling Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, could result in the expulsion of the
local churches from the 5.3 million-member denomination.
   But the Rev. John Frykman of First United Lutheran Church and
the Rev. James DeLange of St. Francis Lutheran Church say they and
their flocks are willing to be ousted to prove their support of the
civil and religious rights of homosexuals.
   ``Gays and lesbians are the largest oppressed minority in this
country,'' Frykman said. ``The church for too long has betrayed gay
and lesbian people and forced them to live as alienated people.''
   The three-day hearing before a 14-member committee marks the
first time the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has sought to
discipline a pastor or congregation, church officials said. The
church was formed in a merger of three major Lutheran groups in
January 1988.
   The panel on Monday may impose a penalty ranging from censure to
suspension to expulsion.
   ``That is a very painful kind of possibility to contemplate,''
said Sierra Pacific Synod Bishop Lyle Miller, who heads the church
in Northern California.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, like most other
mainstream churches, forbids the ordination of sexually active gay
men and lesbians.
   ``We have standards for the ordained, and one of them is that
sexual activity is only to be practiced within the bonds of
marriage,'' said Charles Ruthroff, Miller's assistant.
   Miller filed the charges against St. Francis and First United
after Jeff Johnson, Ruth Frost and Phyllis Zillhart were anointed
``messengers of Jesus Christ'' and installed as assistant pastors
in January. The three, who were grand marshals in last month's Gay
and Lesbian Freedom Day Parade, had refused to take a church vow of
celibacy.
   Johnson, 28, is assistant pastor of United Lutheran, a
predominantly heterosexual congregation of about 100 in the city's
Richmond district. Frost, 42, and Zillhart, 32, a couple for five
years, are at St. Francis, a largely gay congregation in the Castro
district.
   At a news conference Friday, the two pastors and their
assistants said they in turn would put the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America on trial for violating its own promise to be
``inclusive,'' to work for social justice and fight oppression.
   Frykman, recalling how his church was founded in the 16th
century when Martin Luther broke away from the Roman Catholic
Church, accused denomination leaders of ``acting like Roman
bishops'' in attempting to control ordinations.
   DeLange said other Lutheran churches here have adopted a
resolution of support but that his congregation and Frykman's did
not intend to break away from the church.
   ``We are not trying to lead an exodus,'' he said. ``We hope ...
the disciplinary committee will dismiss charges. But we are
prepared to suffer the consequences.''
   Church officials, on the other hand, said the two local churches
were pursing the issue the wrong way.
   ``We don't see this discipline process as a way to change the
policies of the church,'' said Ruthroff. The Sierra Pacific Synod,
he added, already has asked the national church council to
re-examine the ordination of gay men and women.
   ``That's how the guidelines for ordinations should be changed,''
he said.
   The prospect of the new Lutheran church allowing the ordination
of sexually active homosexuals has prompted a dozen congregations
throughout the country to form a conservative ``Great Commission
Network'' to monitor liberal trends in the church.
   ``This is a very painful process for us,'' Ruthroff said.
``Liberals push one way and conservatives push another, and
everyone wants the bishop to act unilaterally when he agrees with
them. We hope our church is big enough to accommodate diverse
viewpoints.''

   A stunt plane flown by a space
shuttle commander collided with another plane during a race at an
air show Saturday, sending the second craft hurtling into a
cornfield and killing its pilot.
   The victim was identified as Henry W. Jones Jr., 69, a retired
fighter pilot from Newport News, Va.
   The plane driven by astronaut Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson landed
safely at the New Braunfels Municipal Airport, 25 miles northeast
of San Antonio. No one on the ground was injured, said city fire
department spokesman Robert Reed.
   Jones and Gibson were aboard single-engine airplanes competing
in a Formula One air race, part of an air show attended by about
4,000 people. Jones was attempting to pass Gibson when the planes
collided at 5 p.m.
   ``The one that crashed was attempting to pass the one that did
not crash as they went around a pylon,'' said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman T.C. Miller.
   Jones' Mingus Special plane lost a wing in the collision and
tumbled through the air, breaking into several sections as it
crashed, Miller said. Gibson was aboard a Cassutt plane.
   The ``midget planes,'' as they are known among aficionados, are
specially designed for low-altitude racing. Gibson and Jones were
racing at speeds of up to 200 mph in the third lap of a six-lap
race that involved circling five large poles with flags on them.
   The death was at least the seventh at an air show in the United
States since May 23.
   Gibson, 43, flew 56 combat missions in Vietnam and became an
astronaut in 1978. He piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in
1984 and commanded the 1986 Columbia mission and the December 1988
Atlantis mission.

   Tamil insurgents Saturday battled
government soldiers who surrounded an important rebel base in the
eastern jungle, military officials said. At least 66 people were
reported killed in two days of fighting.
   At least 39 rebels were killed in other fighting when the navy
bombed their boats, the officials said.
   The latest killings raised to more than 2,080 the number of
combatants killed in nearly a month of new fighting in Sri Lanka's
north and east, where the rebels seek autonomy from the
Sinhalese-dominated government. Many civilians also have died.
   Military officials said Saturday they had surrounded the rebel
stronghold in the Karijikudiaru jungles and cut off sea and land
escape routes. Scores of rebels were believed trapped in the base,
which they have used as a training center, the officials said.
   The camp is believed to be the largest rebel base in eastern Sri
Lanka.
   At least 62 rebels and four civilians were killed Saturday and
Friday in the fighting between the Tamil Tiger rebels and
government security forces, said the military officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Troop reinforcements moved in and naval gunships patrolled the
coast to seal off rebel escape routes.
   In other fighting Friday, at least 39 Tigers were killed when
the navy bombed boats carrying the rebels, the military officials
said.
   The bodies of 11 rebels were found near the east coast town of
Trincomalee and five guerrillas were killed in Batticialoa, also on
the east coast, they said. They gave no details.
   Two rebels riding on a motorcycle were shot and killed in the
eastern district of Ampara, and residents of Batticaloa found the
bodies of four men in the city on Friday, the officials said.
   The four were believed to be civilians who were caught in
crossfire, they said.
   The rebels have suffered heavy losses in the east. But in the
north, the Tigers hold most of the territory and have surrounded
military installations.
   The current round of fighting broke out June 11, when the rebels
broke a a 13-month cease-fire.
   Tamil militants have been campaigning for an independent
homeland since 1983, claiming their community is discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese.
   The mainly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, comprise
75 percent and dominate the military and the government.
   At least 13,000 people have died in the 7-year-old war.

   Antarctic explorer Will Steger got a rousing
welcome home Saturday from nearly all of the 4,289 residents of his
hometown in the north woods.
   ``Incredible,'' was Steger's only reaction after thousands
showered him with confetti and good wishes during a parade through
the tiny business district.
   The 45-year-old explorer left Ely last July to serve as
co-leader of the six-member International Trans-Antarctica
Expedition, the longest unmechanized passage across the frozen
continent.
   ``He's so modest about everything,'' said longtime Ely resident
Dorothy Hutar. ``You'd think with all the attention, he'd get his
nose up in the air. But he's just a regular old guy, I mean, young
guy.''
   Steger, perched between his parents on the back of a
convertible, struggled to wave and sign autographs while holding a
3-month-old puppy.
   The crowd followed him to the end of the parade route,
surrounding him on the steps of Ely High School. He posed for
pictures and signed autographs _ on paper and on the clothes on
some people's backs.
   Reporters, squeezing in questions between autographs, asked
about future plans.
   ``The expedition isn't over,'' Steger said, noting that he'll
begin working Monday on a book about the trip. Then comes a year of
lectures.
   After that? Steger said he wasn't ready to make an official
announcement, but plans future journeys, possibly to northern
Canada.
   But Saturday was for celebration.
   ``This is a big day,'' said Mayor Frank Salerno. ``Things like
this don't happen very often, not in a community this size.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will allow U.S.
commercial satellites to be launched on Soviet rockets for the
first time, The New York Times reported Sunday.
   An Australian commercial venture, the Cape York Space Agency,
will be permitted to hire a U.S. company to run a base in Australia
from which Soviet rockets will carry satellites for customers from
around the world, the Times reported.
   The project, which could be in operation by 1995, would provide
a major opportunity for the Soviet Union to expand its
international space business and would increase competitive
pressures on the American rocket industry, the Times said.
   The National Space Council, an interagency committee headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, met last week and completed a broad set
of recommendations on the international launching business, the
newspaper said, quoting unnamed government and industry officials.
   The Times said the decision to approve the Cape York project was
``among the thorniest issues involved in the council's policy
review.''
   A spokesman for the space council declined to comment on the
report Saturday.
   The newspaper said the State Department intends to grant an
export license to the USBI division of the United Technologies
Corp. to operate the Cape York station, where Soviet Zenit rockets
could be launched.
   The project, estimated to cost nearly $500 million, is backed by
an Australian real estate development company and would not receive
any Australian government funds, the newspaper said. The Soviet
space agency, Glavkosmos, would supply rockets and engineers but
would not own a share in the venture.
   The Times said Australia and the Soviet Union would have to
comply with conditions laid out by the United States, including a
Soviet promise to limit its overseas launching to a single site and
to abide by an international agreement controlling the export of
ballistic missile technologies, which have commercial and military
uses.
   U.S. rocket manufacturers fear they will suffer unfairly in a
head-to-head competition with Soviet suppliers.
   But, the paper said, U.S. satellite companies have warned that,
if they are prevented from putting their payloads on the cheapest
available rockets, they will lose business to foreign satellite
makers.

   Palestinian fundamentalists clashed with
secular militiamen in this southern port city Saturday. Police said
at least one person was killed and five wounded.
   A police spokesman said the two-hour clash with automatic rifles
and rocket-propelled grenades pitted the Moslem fundamentalists
against the Nasserite Popular Organization.
   The fundamentalist Ansarullah faction _ Ansarullah is Arabic for
``God's partisans'' _ was formed recently in the Palestinian
refugee camp of Ein El-Hilweh on the edge of Sidon.
   The Nasserite Popular Organization, led by Mustafa Saad, is the
dominant Sunni Moslem militia in Sidon and maintains close ties
with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
regulations, said the clash broke out when Nasserite militiamen
manning a checkpoint prevented five armed members of the Ansarullah
faction from entering the city.
   The spokeman said the Palestinians opened fire and the Nasserite
militiamen responded in kind, with each side sending
reinforcements. He said the clash lasted for two hours.
   The firefight came a few days after the PLO harshly criticized
Hamas, a fundamentalist organization active in the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip. The Ansarullah faction closely identifies with Hamas,
which has been challenging the pro-PLO leadership of the 30-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   The Palestine Al-Thawra magazine, mouthpiece of the PLO,
launched the attack against Hamas in a commentary in its latest
edition.
   The article accused Hamas of trying to ``break away from the
rules and regulations of the (Palestinian) house.''
   The commentary said such attempts by Hamas ``will only serve the
intrigues of the Zionist enemies and their American masters.''

   Police arrested 44 anti-abortion protesters
Saturday after they rushed into a Planned Parenthood clinic, sat
down in the hallways and refused to leave.
   If was the first such action in Baltimore by Operation Rescue,
said James Guest, Planned Parenthood director for Maryland.
   The group has blockaded abortion clinics around the country in
recent years; 133 people were arrested in Philadelphia on Saturday
in the second day of protests outside the Northeast Women's Clinic.
There were 124 arrests at the clinic Friday.
   The Baltimore protesters, from the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, entered the clinic at about 8:30 a.m., said police
spokesman Dennis Hill. It took about 75 police officers five hours
to remove the protesters, six of whom had locked themselves
together or to objects.
   The 38 adults face misdemeanor charges of trespassing, blocking
access to a medical facility and disobeying police orders, police
said. Six juveniles face similar charges under juvenile laws.
   Maryland Planned Parenthood Director James Guest said three
employees of the center plan to file assault charges.
   ``One person was tackled, then they trampled over him coming in.
A security guard was pushed to the ground and another person was
pinned up against a wall,'' Guest said.
   One of the protesters, who would identify herself only as Mary,
denied any assaults took place during the occupation.
   Guest said the scheduled abortions went on as planned after
police escorted or carried the protesters out on stretchers.

<HEAD>Report: West German Firms Built Iraqi Supergun Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ESSEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German conglomerate has built
a steel plant in Iraq capable of constructing a giant cannon that
could hurl artillery shells at Israel, a West German magazine
reported Saturday.
   Der Spiegel, West Germany's leading news magazine, reported the
conglomerate, led by the Ferrostaal AG steel firm, built a
``universally capable foundry'' near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
   Senior Ferrostaal executives said the plant would be used to
manufacture more than 1,000 small and medium-caliber artillery
pieces for the Iraqi army, Der Spiegel said.
   Experts believe the plant will ultimately be used to make a
``super cannon'' with which Iraq could fire huge artillery shells
into Israel, the magazine said.
   Last spring, customs authorities in Britain, West Germany and
other nations confiscated sections of steel tubing they claimed
could be used as part of such a weapon.
   Almost a dozen smaller West German firms, in addition to
Ferrostaal, supplied components and equipment for the Iraqi plant,

   A doctor imprisoned for killing his wife
gets to keep the house in Pennsylvania where he buried her in the
basement, according to a settlement of a wrongful-death lawsuit
filed on behalf of their children.
   Dr. John Boyle Jr. also will keep $20,000, according to the
agreement. It was filed Thursday and Richland County Probate Judge
Richard Christiansen said Friday that he approved it.
   The settlement means that the estate of murder victim Noreen
Boyle gets the remainder of the assets she and the doctor
accumulated. Boyle agreed to a judgment of $500,000 in response to
the lawsuit filed by attorney Dane Arlen Bonecutter on behalf of
the Boyles' children _ Collier, 12, and Elizabeth, 3.
   The courts appointed the attorney because Boyle's assets were
frozen after his arrest, and the murder left it unclear who would
take care of the children.
   Mrs. Boyle's estate can try to collect by pursuing any future
income Boyle may earn, such as by selling the rights to his story
to book publishers or movie producers, Bonecutter said.
   The judgment also settles a paternity suit against Boyle by his
girlfriend, Sherri Campbell, who gave birth to a girl in January.
Ms. Campbell settled for $67,500.
   Boyle, 47, was convicted June 29 of aggravated murder and abuse
of a corpse, and was sentenced to life in prison with no
possibility of parole for at least 20 years.
   Prosecutors alleged he suffocated his wife in their Mansfield
home on Dec. 31 and buried her under the basement floor of a house
he had just bought in suburban Erie, Pa., for $299,900.
Investigators dug up her body on Jan. 25.
   Boyle planned to live in the house with his children and Ms.
Campbell, according to testimony. Juvenile Court Judge Paul Christ
is to decide who will gain custody of the children.

   President Bush is sharing credit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for NATO's decision to tone down its war-fighting
doctrine, saying the embattled Soviet leader is entitled to declare
``I've been right'' in dealing with the West.
   Bush said Gorbachev can boast that the 16-nation NATO alliance
agreed to overhaul its strategy in direct response to
Soviet-sanctioned democratic changes in Eastern Europe.
   At the same time, Bush observed, ``It was the United States'
draft that shaped the new direction for NATO.''
   Gorbachev ``should get on the offensive'' against Soviet critics
who are angry over the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the pullback
of Red Army troops, Bush suggested Friday at the conclusion of
NATO's two-day summit.

   Bearing the offer of a non-aggression pact and a
pledge to cut German forces, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner
is heading for Moscow on the alliance's most hopeful mission yet
for allaying Soviet fears about German unification and decades of
East-West enmity.
   A day after Woerner arrives in the Soviet capital on July 14,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will also meet with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The visits reflect a stepped-up drive by the Western allies to
develop new ties and pacts with the Soviet Union following NATO's
dramatic revamping of its longstanding military strategy at a
summit which ended Friday in London.
   ``The London Declaration transforms our relationship with old
adversaries,'' declared President Bush, who drafted the new
doctrine. ``To those governments who confronted us in the Cold War,
our alliance extends the hand of friendship.''

   Abortion foes stepped up pressure on the
Louisiana Senate to follow the House lead and override Gov. Buddy
Roemer's veto of the toughest state abortion bill in the nation.
   The House voted 73-31 late Friday to reject Roemer's veto. It
was the first time even one chamber of the Legislature had
overridden a veto this century.
   But the outcome of the Senate vote was in doubt. Anti-abortion
forces have only until midnight Monday to line up the necessary 26
votes.
   Sen. Allen Bares, a supporter of the bill, acknowledged to his
colleagues Friday night that abortion foes do not have the
necessary two-thirds majority of the 39-member Senate. The Senate

   Federal investigators were sent to
examine the wreckage of a chemical plant today to find the cause of
a thunderous explosion that killed 17 workers and sent dozens of
employees scrambling for safety.
   Two tanks that collected waste water and flammable hydrocarbons
exploded at the Arco Chemical Co. plant about 15 miles east of
Houston late Thursday. The blast could be heard 20 miles away.
   ``When I heard it, I knew what had happened,'' said employee
Kathryn Cox. ``I hollered to my people, `Y'all run, run as fast as
you can!' I looked back twice and then I just kept running because
I knew if it went again, we'd probably get blown up.''
   The explosion leveled an area the size of a city block. Five
people, including two people living near the complex, suffered
minor injuries.

<HEAD>Senators Turn Their Attention to Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military spending in a post-Cold War era as
well as the fate of the B-2 stealth bomber and Osprey aircraft top
the agenda this week as the Senate finally begins working on a 1991
defense budget.
   White House and congressional negotiators still haven't agreed
on how to reduce the federal budget deficit by $50 billion for
fiscal 1991. And that has delayed action on the $307-billion
military budget that President Bush unveiled in January.
   But the Senate Armed Services Committee has decided it can wait
no longer. Committee members, working behind closed doors, will
draw up a defense blueprint for full Senate consideration just
prior to the August recess.
   In fact, they'll be giving senators two different budgets to
mull over.
   Committee chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said one bill will
allocate $286 billion for defense _ the figure proposed by the
Senate Budget Committee. The other will use Nunn's own budget range
of $289 billion to $291 billion.
   Nunn said the process will be an ``educational effort'' that
will show ``the difficulty in making the kinds of cuts'' lawmakers
have called for since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.
   It's a given on Capitol Hill that Bush's $307 billion proposal
will be cut. The question is only by how much.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel,
said the $286 billion budget will prove that ``the only bank from
which those dollars can flow would be unacceptable cuts in
personnel and maintenance accounts.''
   In another break with tradition, the Senate Armed Services
Committee will craft defense legislation ahead of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   The Democratic leadership had wanted the House to complete a
military budget before August. But the House is behind schedule and
probably won't even start working on a bill until September,
according to congressional sources who requested anonymity.
   The House is behind, in part, because there still isn't
agreement on an overall budget figure for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1.
   But another factor, the sources said, is the trouble committee
chairman Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., has had getting House members to
let go of their pet defense issues and work on drafting a bill.
   The major issue facing Congress is the B-2 stealth bomber, the
bat-winged plane that according to the latest Congressional Budget
Office report will cost $860 million a copy.
   Faced with increasing budget constraints and a diminished Soviet
threat to the West, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has suggested
buying only 75 stealth bombers, instead of 132.
   He also suggested buying only two of the bombers in fiscal 1991,
instead of five. But the Air Force has told Congress that buying
three fewer bombers would only save about $900 million of the $5.5
billion for the B-2 program.
   ``The sticker price is driving that decision,'' Warner said in
an interview last week.
   In the House, sponsors of a bill to kill the program after the
15 planes now in production say they are just a handful of votes
away from approval.
   ``Not yet, but we're close, real close,'' said Rep. John
Rowland, R-Conn., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Rowland acknowledged that he faces a formidable task because
Northrop Corp., the bomber's manufacturer, is lobbying hard to keep
it and the Air Force is willing to give up the once-crucial MX
nuclear missile on railroad cars in exchange for the B-2.
   On the Senate side, Nunn and Warner remain strong supporters of
the stealth bomber and comparable legislation to kill the program
has not made significant progress.
   Support has increased, however, for the V-22 Osprey, the
tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and can fly
like a plane. Cheney wants to cancel the $27 billion program,
arguing that a mix of helicopters is cheaper than building the
Osprey.
   But lawmakers from Texas and Pennsylvania, where the aircraft is
built, have touted a recent internal Pentagon report that says the
Osprey is cost-effective.
   Warner also said that as the nation turns its attention from
weapons used to fight the Soviet Union and focuses on limited
conflicts and Third World threats ``that's where the V-22 has begun
to gain added significance.''
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill this week, congressional budget
negotiators plan to meet with White House counterparts in search of
an agreement to cut the federal budget deficit.
   Agreement has been elusive after nearly two months of talks but
the bargaining intensified after Bush eased his position against
taxes on June 26 _ saying he now believes they must be included in
any budget pact.
   The Senate also is expected to approve an omnibus crime bill
that calls for curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons, plus
capital punishment for 30 federal crimes ranging from presidential
assassination to espionage.
   One possible amendment to the bill is a controversial plan that
would allow private citizens frustrated by the pace of prosecution
in the $325 billion savings and loan mess to sue alleged defrauders
and pocket some of the damages.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Greenspan looks for zeros as patiently as a
guy with a handful of quarters stationed in front of a slot
machine, but the combination he wants just doesn't come up.
   Greenspan wants zero inflation in the American economy, and he
is willing to battle the odds and take big risks in order to get
it. A lot of people think he'll bust the economy in seeking that
goal.
   So be it, Chairman Greenspan seems to say, contending that if
inflation isn't drawn out of the economy now it will simply
reappear and scuttle the next economic advance. Deny it fuel,
suffocate the fires.
   As head of the Federal Reserve Board, Greenspan is effectively
in charge of monetary policy. His hands control the money supply,
the fuel, and by keeping a firm hand on those levers he can force
his will on the economy.
   That is, in pursuit of zero inflation he can slow the economy to
the point where consumer willingness and ability to buy will
diminish, where producers will cut output, where borrowing and
lending will wane.
   The big risk in seeking zero inflation is recession, and many
relatively well-informed people think the economy is on the brink
of it. Gross national product is barely growing. Job growth is down
sharply. Manufacturing is weak.
   True, the service sector _ as opposed to the goods-producing
sector _ shows a moderate amount of vitality, but those who worry
about inflation observe that this same sector is where prices are
still continuing to rise.
   Nobody really wants to see an economy declining; everyone
benefits from an economy that grows without inflation. But too
often, Greenspan supporters say, growth has been diminished and
then halted by inflation.
   Broadly speaking, those who support the chairman in his war on
inflation, who encourage him to hold fast against pressures to
lower interest rates _ which would spur economic activity _ have
some solid grounds for so thinking.
   In their view, the coals of demand-pull inflation still smolder.
That type of inflation occurs when easy money allows people to
demand goods and services at a rate that cannot be sustained.
Eventually, the glowing coals flame up.
   The zero inflationists believe the country may not be able to
stand such an excess of activity, given its inability to solve
existing debt problems _ a consequence, it should be noted, of
earlier excesses.
   Among the existing excesses are the federal budget deficit, (a
consequence of excessive government spending), the foreign trade
deficit, municipal and state debt, taxpayer debt incurred in
collapses of savings and loans, unpaid foreign debt to U.S. banks,
high mortgage debt, real estate development debt, consumer
installment debt. ...
   Let's get some of the excesses reduced before we try another
expansion, say Fed defenders. But what appears to be a growing
number of critics contends that in waiting for that time, the Fed
might waste the economy.
   Stakes like that make penny arcades of the biggest casinos, and
they put pressures on the monetary players that are inconceivable
in a gambling casino. What this country needs is some flashing
zeros.

<TEXT>
   If the rise of the stock market to record highs
this year has produced a new wave of optimism in the business
world, you can't tell it by the level of activity in stock splits
and dividend increases.
   In textbook bull markets, corporate boards of directors act in
large numbers to celebrate the upward course of prosperity by
voting a split, or a higher dividend payout, or both at the same
time.
   Right now, figures compiled by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. attest,
they are doing neither at anything like the rate of boom years in
the past.
   Through the first half of 1990 S&amp;P tallied 48 splits of at least
three shares for two among the 1,600-plus companies listed on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   At that rate, the total for the year might fall short of
matching the 105 splits recorded in 1989 _ mounting no threat at
all to the record of 225 set in 1983.
   The story on dividends from all the public companies reporting
to S&amp;P is even less impressive.
   The firm counted 868 ``favorable'' dividend actions _ increases,
resumptions of suspended dividends and declarations of extra or
special payouts _ in the first half of this year, down from 1,155
in the comparable period of 1989.
   On the other side of the coin, the number of unfavorable
changes, including reductions and omissions, swelled to 187 in this
year's first half from 109 over the like period last year.
   These figures point up two of the most common complaints voiced
by Wall Streeters and their customers about the ``bull market,''
1990-style.
   The paucity of splits demonstrates ``the narrowness of the
recent market rally,'' in the words of S&amp;P analysts, with much of
the gains concentrated in a few dozen big-name blue chips and
growth stocks.
   Sluggish dividend activity, meanwhile, spotlights persistent
weakness in corporate earnings, which has led to much doubt and
skepticism about the staying power of the advance in stock prices.
   A stock split represents a gesture by a company's directors with
more symbolic than tangible value.
   In a 2-for-1 split, for example, the number of shares
outstanding is doubled, cutting earnings per share in half and
producing no change in the total market value of an investor's
holdings. ``It's comparable to receiving two $10 bills for a $20,''
S&amp;P notes.
   Splits can, however, broaden enthusiasm for a stock in the
marketplace by making 100-share round lots easier for small
investors to buy. Furthermore, the stamp of optimism they register
is quite often reinforced with an accompanying increase in the
dividend.
   When such dividend increases are scarce, as they are right now,
the bottom-line impact is felt directly in calculations of
investors' total return _ capital appreciation plus current income.
   At midyear, the dividend yield on the 30 stocks that make up the
Dow Jones industrial average stood at 3.74 percent, compared with
9.19 percent for a sampling of top-grade corporate bonds tracked by
Barron's magazine.
   Analysts say that wide competitive disparity helps put stock
prices largely at the mercy of changes in interest-rate
expectations.
   One note of consolation: Both stock splits and dividends right
now show very little sign of the kind of speculative enthusiasm
that is often cited as a warning of an impending top in stock
prices.
   So if you buy the optimistic view, the current dearth of splits
and dividend increases holds out hope that the best is yet to come
for stocks.

<HEAD>Secrecy, Security Replace Festive Mood for Japan's Coronation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secrecy and security have become the watchwords in
thwarting the plans of radical leftists to disrupt Japan's first
coronation in more than six decades.
   In 1928, tens of thousands of cheering, flag-waving Japanese
joined in the fun when rice was planted for the late Emperor
Hirohito's coronation. Drummers, traditional dancers, government
dignitaries, even stunt planes participated in a rice-planting
festival that lasted all day.
   Times have changed.
   This year, there will be no disclosure of the two ``sacred''
paddies used to grow the rice Emperor Akihito will offer the gods
after his enthronement in November. The government says only that
the rice is being grown in two states with countless rice paddies,
Akita in the north and Oita in the west.
   Masataka Otomo, a spokesman for the Akita state government,
said: ``The final word on exactly whose paddy and where won't be
made public until after the rice is harvested.''
   Even moving two thrones from western Japan to Tokyo in May
became a major tactical operation. Military helicopters and a
convoy of disguised police trucks were involved in transporting the
disassembled, crated thrones under cover of darkness.
   Authorities say tight security is needed to guard against
attacks from the radical leftists.
   ``Secrecy is not the wish of the government or the imperial
family,'' said Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief Cabinet secretary. ``We
want to hold the ceremonies in the most open manner possible. The
reason is the attitude of the radicals.''
   A spokesman for the ultraleft Chukaku-ha (Middle Core Faction)
said: ``That's just an excuse for them to carry out their
oppression to protect that anti-people institution.''
   He said in an interview, on condition of anonymity, that his
often-violent group would ``continue the struggle to crush the
coronation.''
   Radical leftists number in the thousands, but represent only a
tiny minority of Japanese, who generally either support or accept
the imperial household.
   During the mystical rice ritual, to be held after Akihito is
formally enthroned Nov. 12, the emperor is believed to commune with
the sun goddess and other Shinto deities.
   The Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual, will take place in
two specially built halls on the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo,
beginning late at night and lasting several hours.
   Although it has been part of coronations for more than 1,000
years, the Daijosai's religious nature has prompted intense debate
of whether government plans to provide funds for it violate the
postwar constitution. The budget for the entire coronation is 8.11
billion yen ($55.6 million).
   More than 30,000 police are expected to protect the guests
expected to attend the coronation, who include Prince Charles and
Princess Diana of Britain and President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
   That number of police officers would be equal to about three of
four in Tokyo and one of every 10 nationwide.
   About the same number helped guard Hirohito's funeral in
February. President George Bush and representatives of more than
160 other nations attended the funeral.
   Once a precedent has been set for security arrangements, ``it is
very hard to propose a lower level,'' a police source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If something goes wrong, you
will always be remembered as the one who let it happen.''
   The visibility of police in the weeks before the funeral,
coupled with spot checks of cars and ``interviews'' of residents
living in strategic areas led to many complaints that human rights
were being violated.
   Police vigilance did not, however, stop leftist radicals from
setting fire to a shrine near the funeral site and planting a bomb
along the funeral procession route. No one was injured by the bomb.

<TEXT>
  The Federal Reserve's reluctance to reinvigorate
the flagging economy means consumers could soon feel the pinch that
already has squeezed many manufacturers and builders, a growing
chorus of analysts say.
   Confidence among consumers in their financial well-being lags,
partly due to months of disappointing economic news. Reports of
factory layoffs, slumping house prices and business belt-tightening
have shaken faith in continuing prosperity.
   ``It's time to get interest rates lower,'' says Robert A.
Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
``I think the Fed should ease. But I think the Fed looks at the
word ease like a four-letter word.''
   The central bank has resisted altering policy despite ample
evidence that a change is warranted, Brusca says. The June
unemployment data, released Friday, furnished more proof that the
economy is dangerously debilitated and in need of urgent attention.
   ``As I read the numbers, real problems have already started,''
Brusca says, noting that recessionary conditions aren't confined to
factories and building sites anymore.
   Stores, for instance, particularly ones that supply expensive,
long-lasting merchandise such as home appliances, have had weak
sales for months. The contraction in total retail sales has
produced the worst period for consumer spending in nine years,
economists say.
   Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities
Inc., says: ``I think over the next couple of months we'll continue
to see rather sluggish spending on the part of the consumer
reflecting his waning confidence.''
   The Labor Department's monthly assessment showed private,
non-farm businesses created 92,000 new jobs in June, a weaker
number than the 125,000 payroll additions private analysts had
expected.
   Private industry has added only about 100,000 new jobs a month
so far in 1990, after subtracting the government's once-a-decade
hiring of census workers. At mid-year in 1989, private payrolls
were growing about 200,000 a month. This year's weak job growth has
coincided with slumps in manufacturing and construction.
   At the same time, the civilian jobless rate has stayed stuck at
about the same plateau. It dipped to 5.2 percent in June from May's
5.3 percent largely because fewer people were looking for work,
pushing down the labor force tally.
   Bond traders were frustrated by the widely awaited report
because it lacked any compelling reason for the Fed to do anything
other than what it has been doing.
   Part of the Fed's stubborness in sticking to current policy
stems from an unwillingness to jeopardize its credibility by
appearing to bow to the Bush administration's badgering.
Administration officials have been pressuring the Fed to pursue a
more generous credit posture and nudge interest rates lower.
   David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc., says the latest unemployment news gave the Fed
support for its argument against easing.
   He said the Fed can point to the figures and ask: ``If our
policies are so bad, how come unemployment is falling?'' Central
bank policymakers also can claim some credit in the fight against
inflation, the Fed's chief mission.
   Resler says he believes a standoff situation has developed
between the Fed on the one side and the markets and the
administration on the other.
   The markets and the adminstration want the Fed to enable
interest rates to fall by making credit cheaper to come by in the
banking system. The Fed would prefer to have its key lending rates
it directly controls follow, rather than precede, market rates down.
   ``The Fed doesn't want to lead the charge. The market, though,
is looking for the Fed to make the first step. Neither one is
budging,'' Resler says.
   Agreement on a plan to cut the federal deficit at the budget
summit in Washington will probably be the catalyst that causes the
Fed finally to budge, economists expect.

<HEAD>Growth Stocks Back On Top</HEAD>

   The economy may be barely maintaining headway
right now in the midst of recession fears, but growth is a hot
commodity on Wall Street anyway.
   Some analysts say its popularity may be reviving a set of
financial principles that fell out of favor for much of the past
decade.
   In the stock market's rally to record highs over the past couple
of months, many of the standout performers have been shares of
large companies with long records of consistent, above-average
earnings growth.
   When the typical money manager picks stocks these days, the
emphasis is on high quality and stability, an international
presence, and an ability to ride out recessions as well as the
shock of any debt crisis that might arise.
   The growth-stock theory of investing enjoyed a long vogue a
generation or more ago. It flourished in the strong expansion of
the 1950s and 1960s, exemplified by the successes of such hardy
growth enterprises as International Business Machines Corp.
   The fashion reached the point of frenzy in the early 1970s, when
investors poured almost limitless amounts of money into the
so-called ``favorite 50'' growth companies, which were billed as
good buys at any price.
   A severe bear market punctured that bubble, however, and even
when stocks began a subsequent recovery investors looked elsewhere
for inspiration.
   When the boom of the '80s got rolling, the watchword was
``value,'' rather than growth. Investors sought companies with
assets whose market values might blossom in a hothouse of
takeovers, buyouts and corporate restructurings.
   Now, many analysts say, as the cleanup continues from that binge
of borrowing and speculation, growth stocks may be getting another
chance to shine.
   ``The stock market is nowhere near as outrageously overpriced as
a lot of other things,'' says Barton Biggs, investment strategist
at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   ``As money flees the carnage, why won't it run to high quality
bonds and equities? It has to go somewhere, and if money begins to
worry seriously about the safety of banks and money market funds,
the shares of real growth companies with global franchises may look
as good as anything.''
   The growth-stock theme manifested itself clearly in the second
quarter, when prominent companies in industries like
pharmaceuticals and food posted some of the best gains.
   It remained in evidence this past week as the market got off to
a quiet start on the third quarter. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed Friday at 2,904.95, up 24.26 from the week
before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.30 to
195.78; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 1.75 to 460.54, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 2.44 at 358.87.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 125.07 million shares a day,
against 140.55 million the week before.
   Investment themes have come and gone with stunning speed on Wall
Street in the past few years. So few analysts are ready to declare
with any certainty that the growth stocks' comeback is booked for a
long run.
   When and if interest rates fall further and the economy shows
signs of picking up momentum, the search for bargains in the market
could well shift to industrial and other cyclical companies with
close ties to the business cycle.
   In any event, nobody claims it's easy to pick winning growth
stocks that can sustain their performance over periods of years
rather than weeks.
   A single quarterly earnings disappointment has been enough to
knock many a glamour stock off its perch of late.
   But for the moment at least, the trend seems indisputable. ``We
are in a growth stock market,'' said John Connolly at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``Our strategy continues to have consumer growth
issues at the core of our portfolio.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Industry Shows More of Its Pulpy Side</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   A slow economy, pressing debts and fewer readers
have combined to demonstrate vividly the growing vulnerability
among American newspaper publishers.
   Two of the most prominent names in newspapering, Ralph M.
Ingersoll II and the Gannett Co., emerged this past week as the
latest sufferers from a slowdown in what historically has been a
highly profitable industry.
   Ingersoll, the ambitious publishing executive who financed a
U.S. expansion partly through high-interest junk bond credit and
unsuccessfully launched a new St. Louis paper earlier this year,
relinquished control of his American newspaper interests to an
investment partner, E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co.
   In the same transaction, Ingersoll acquired Warburg's
half-interest in a European newspaper publisher. He thereby
extricated himself from the debt burden of his three U.S.
publishing companies, which owe about $700 million.
   Ingersoll said his primary motive was to exploit what he
believed to be a vibrant market for newspapers in Europe, which has
become the most economically dynamic part of the world.
   But industry analysts said the high debt load Ingersoll amassed
in this country clearly was a key reason for the move, which seemed
to shatter his desire to become one of the biggest newspaper owners
in the United States. He had controlled 10 dailies and more than
120 weeklies.
   Sheer size, however, does not necessarily make a newspaper
empire invulnerable. Gannett, the current No. 1 newspaper company
in the country, disclosed its own form of financial distress this
past week.
   The 82-daily newspaper giant, which also publishes USA Today
nationally, said it expected second-quarter earnings to fall. That
would mark the first time since Gannett went public 22 years ago
that quarterly earnings have declined from a year earlier. The
company is due to issue second-quarter earnings later this month.
   As one of the most financially stable newspaper companies,
Gannett does not have the debt problem Ingersoll faced. But both
have been affected by what industry strategists have called some
common underlying trends.
   ``The newspaper industry has been suffering a slowdown for the
last three years as advertising revenues have slowed,'' said Susan
Putnam, who follows the newspaper business for Moran &amp; Associates
Inc., an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``They've cut costs
and got operations down to a lean level. But revenue growth hasn't
picked up. So they're suffering earnings declines.''
   The sluggishness rippling through the economy has complicated
the outlook for newspapers, which generally derive most of their
revenue from retail, automobile and classified advertising.
   Many retailers, hurt by high debt levels of their own, have cut
back drastically on ads, although publicizing sales in newspapers
historically has been considered the cheapest and most effective
way to attract customers.
   Automakers, which also are slumping, haven't been aggressively
offering rebates this year, which in turn tends to reduce the
amount of newspaper advertising by dealers.
   Within the classified ad category, the most prevalent ads _ real
estate and employment _ also have fallen, analysts say.
   In some economically depressed parts of the country where many
properties are for sale, for example, owners and brokers simply
have given up advertising in newspapers because of poor response.
   This past week the Conference Board, a New York-based business
research group that tracks the volume of employment advertising,
said its help-wanted index dropped in May to the lowest level in
four years. In recession-battered New England, the level was off by
nearly a third from a year earlier.
   Many newspapers have responded to their slump partly by
aggressive drives to increase circulation. This gives newspapers
the justification to charge more for ads, because presumably they
are seen by more readers.
   But this strategy has been been undermined by another problem
that the newspaper industry increasingly is confronting: Many
people, particularly the young, aren't reading the papers.
   Some studies show, for example, that only 30 percent of
Americans under age 35 read a paper regularly, about half the
percentage of two decades ago.
   Perhaps the most troubling study was released recently by the
Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press, which shows the
younger generation ``knows less, cares less and reads newspapers
less'' than any generation in the past 50 years.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More evidence emerged of softness in the economy. The
unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.2 percent, but that was due to
fewer people looking for work. New job growth remained weak.
   _Boeing Co. received a jumbo-jet order potentially worth $6.9
billion from British Airways PLC, but will have to wait for word on
whether it receives an order from UAL Corp. that could be worth $20
billion. Unions trying to buy UAL delayed negotiations on their
potentially record jetliner order until they secure financing for
their acquisition of the airline company.
   _Brokers who belly up to the bar could be in for a doubly
unpleasant tax surprise. The federal government, seeking ways to
raise tax revenues to close the federal budget deficit, is
considering a 0.5 percent levy on securities sales and may seek to
sharply raise the excise tax on alcohol.
