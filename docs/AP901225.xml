<HEAD>American, Deaf Thais Produce Pioneering Dictionary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Deaf Thais aided by an American have
produced what they say is the first real dictionary for the deaf in
the developing world. They hope it will help end discrimination
against the handicapped in Thailand.
   The 1,500-page dictionary took eight years to complete and
involved setting down 3,500 signs in pictoral form, according to
editor-in-chief Owen Wrigley, 37, of Manhattan, Kan. The dictionary
is to be officially released shortly.
   ``We hope it will provide not only a useful tool for the deaf
but that the dictionary is offered as proof that the Thais have a
distinctive national sign language,'' Wrigley said in an interview.
   Wrigley said it is hoped such recognition would help the cause
of the deaf, who now are barred from government service and from
the Buddhist monkhood. They cannot legally acquire driving licenses
and some Thais want them to lose the right to vote on grounds the
deaf are not literate.
   It is conservatively estimated that 100,000 Thais are deaf. That
figure does not incloude those who lose their hearing in old age.
Most are poor manual laborers, seamstresses and street vendors.
   Wrigley estimates that at most 5 percent of deaf children are
able to attend schools. The only deaf college graduate known in
Thailand is a woman who lost her hearing as a teen-ager and was
able to complete a teacher's training college course.
   A Disabled Persons Act aimed at giving the handicapped a better
deal has languished in Parliament for years.
   Wrigley said he became involved in helping the deaf shortly
after arriving in Thailand in 1981 with the U.S.-based
International Human Assistance Program. The United Nations had
declared that year the Year of the Disabled Person.
   Working with the National Association of the Deaf in Thailand,
Wrigley obtained funds for the project from the U.S. government,
United Nations, Canada, Australia and local donors.
   The research team included deaf people. One, a dynamic young
woman named Manfa Suwanarat, died before the dictionary was
completed after receiving questionable treatment for a medical
ailment.
   The team interviewed the deaf throughout Thailand, taking notes
and photographing the signs they used to communicate. The
dictionary graphically depicts the signs and explains them in
written form in Thai and English.
   A few of the signs were drawn from abroad, particularly American
sign language, but by far the largest majority have their roots in
Thailand and its culture.
   To communicate ``Thailand,'' in sign language, the forefinger is
extended and crooked to resemble an elephant's trunk. The elephant
features prominently in Thai history and culture.
   Wrigley said dictionaries for the deaf are a recent development.
The first appeared in the United States in 1965. Only a few other
nations in the West have produced or are working on them. There are
no full-fledged dictionaries for the deaf known to exist in the
developing world.
   Wrigley notes that many people believe the deaf can communicate
easily through an international sign language. One such does exist
- developed in Italy in the 1960s and called Gestuno - but Wrigley
says it has about as much popularity and relevance as the
international spoken language Esperanto.

   The northern coast region of
Queensland was declared a disaster zone today because of
devastation wrought by Cyclone Joy, now weakened off the
northeastern coast.
   State disaster relief officials said damage estimates were put
at more than $30 million.
   After three days of battering coast communities with high winds
and rainfall associated with the storm, the cyclone slowly
dissipated as it moved southeast down the coast.
   Officials said the tourist town of Cairns sustained more than
$7.5 million in damage. Banana growers also suffered heavily. Some
lost half their crop.
   Power was cut in Cairns, roofs of houses were torn off, highways
were flooded and the international airport was closed for two days.
Some tourists had to spend Christmas Day in the airport compound or
in makeshift tents.
   As a disaster zone, the northern coast region is eligible for
state funds to help in the cleanup.
   At its strongest, Cyclone Joy packed winds of 145 mph at its
center. By today, the winds had dropped by nearly half and the
Brisbane Weather Office said the storm was no longer a major threat
to coast communities.

   Foy David Kohler, a career diplomat and the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow during the height of the Cold War, died
Sunday at age 82.
   Kohler died at Jupiter Hospital after a long illness. The
hospital released no details on the cause of death.
   Kohler was ambassador to the Soviet Union from August 1962 to
November 1966. He was considered a member of the realist school of
international politics, which emphasized the importance of
military, economic and political power in world affairs.
   Kohler first went to Moscow in January 1947 as first secretary
of the U.S. Embassy. He was there when Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev and then-Vice President Richard Nixon toured a model
American kitchen during a 1959 American exposition in Moscow.
   Khrushchev became angry, and the ``kitchen debate'' between him
and Nixon drew international attention.
   President John F. Kennedy tapped the Russian-speaking diplomat
to become ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1962. Shortly after he
arrived in Moscow, the Cuban missile crisis erupted and brought the
world to the brink of war.
   Kohler retired in 1967, then spent almost 11 years as a
professor at the University of Miami's graduate center for Advanced
International Studies.

<TEXT>
   The world's poor nations have been dealt
a staggering economic blow by Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait
and the higher oil prices it created.
   Countries struggling to climb out of poverty are having to cope
with losses in the billions of dollars.
   Rising prices of gasoline and other petroleum products have
affected every sector of their economies. Inflation abounds, trade
has suffered and foreign exchange reserves are shrinking.
   ``It's a big blow,'' said Gene Tidrick, a World Bank economist
in New Delhi. ``The big problem is uncertainty. No one knows for
how long this will last.''
   Many developing nations find the U.N. embargo of trade with Iraq
and occupid Kuwait has affected their exports.
   The International Monetary Fund estimates the crisis cost
African nations $2 billion in 1990.
   India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka stand to lose a total
of more than $2.5 billion in 1990. All four import oil, had strong
trade links with Iraq and Kuwait and received remittances from
thousands of citizens working in the two nations.
   Economists in New Delhi project a loss of more than $2.5 billion
for India alone if the crisis continues until March.
   Brazil's oil bill has risen $1.2 billion. Philippine government
efforts to cope with the problem prompted demonstrations against
President Corazon Aquino.
   Here is a review of some developing countries and how they are
affected:
   BANGLADESH - A continuing crisis in the gulf would cost more
than $500 million a year: $150 million in lost remittances from
workers, $222 million in higher oil prices and $150 million in lost
exports and tax revenue, mostly from tea and jute sales.
   BRAZIL - The oil bill has doubled to $600 million a month,
inflation is rising and many Brazilian companies with projects in
Iraq had to abandon them.
   CHILE - About $200 million has been added to the 1990 oil bill
and an oil stabilization fund has been established, primarily with
money from an increase in the price of copper, Chile's main export.
   EGYPT - Lost revenues totaled $6.7 billion because of a decline
in the tourist industry, reduced income from the Suez Canal and an
end to remittances from 400,000 Egyptians working in Iraq and
Kuwait. The United States and Persian Gulf nations wrote off
Egyptian debts of $13.7 billion, however, and the rise in oil
prices helped Egypt, an oil exporter.
   HUNGARY - Total losses are about $200 million, officials say,
including $145 million Iraq owes Hungary and $55 million in
canceled contracts. Not included is $120 million in higher prices
for oil, most of which comes from the Soviet Union.
   INDIA - Economists say the cost will reach $2.72 billion by the
end of the fiscal year in March, including $2.3 billion in
increased oil imports, $220 million in lost remittances from
workers and $167 million in lost exports. Foreign exchange reserves
fell to less than $2 billion in November. The government has
increased gasoline prices 25 percent and is trying to get a loan
from the International Monetary Fund.
   KENYA - Fuel prices have risen 30 percent. Vice President George
Saitoti asked Kenyans to limit driving and stop buying imported
goods.
   PAKISTAN - All Pakistan's refined oil products came from Kuwait.
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said the crisis is costing $33 million
a month and analysts say annual inflation could reach 20 percent.
About $2 billion has been added to the foreign debt of $15.5
billion.
   PHILIPPINES - Filipinos held street protests in response to Mrs.
Aquino's efforts to raise the prices of petroleum products by an
average 45 percent. She later rolled back some increases. The
Philippines has lost remittances from 30,000 citizens who returned
from jobs in Iraq and Kuwait.
   SRI LANKA - Officials put the cost for 1990 at $130 million and
say the annual inflation rate might surpass 20 percent. Many of the
90,000 Sri Lankans working in the gulf region have returned home
and losses of remittances are expected to reach $53 million. Higher
oil prices will raise the energy bill by $87 million.
   ZAMBIA - Fuel costs have more than doubled, causing the prices
of transportation, food and other necessities to soar.
   ZIMBABWE - Energy cost about $400 million in 1990, nearly double
the previous figure. President Robert Mugabe recommended that
developing nations pool energy resources and technology to blunt
the impact.

<HEAD>Freed Hostages and Families Enjoy Christmas They Thought They'd
Miss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bonnie Anderton was going to spend Christmas Day in the nation's
capital campaigning for the release of Iraq's hostages - including
her husband. She and 11-year-old daughter Jennifer had a petition
to deliver to the Iraqi Embassy.
   ``It was the nicest wasted effort I've ever made,'' said Mrs.
Anderton, whose husband, Richard, was among holdouts at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait allowed to leave in time for the holidays.
   Just two weeks ago, she and families around the nation wondered
whether they'd ever see their captive loved ones again. Since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, they'd had mostly bad news - or none at
all.
   ``He didn't think he'd be home and we didn't think he'd be
home,'' Mrs. Anderton, 40, said Monday from Larkspur, Colo.
``That's why it's so special just to be together.''
   They're thankful at how things worked out for them, especially
compared with the nearly 300,000 U.S. servicemen and women in the
Persian Gulf and their families. Despite the Andertons' good
fortune, it's still a somber holiday season with the United States
on the brink of war.
   ``I'm extremely glad my husband isn't sitting on the 50-yard
line, but there's still a tremendous problem to be solved,'' Mrs.
Anderton said. ``It's far from over.''
   Pete Dooley never thought he'd be out in time to sip champagne
and sit around the Christmas tree opening gifts at home in
Kentucky. In a twinkling, he went from hiding in Iraqi-occupied
Kuwait to freedom and the loving arms of relatives who had prepared
for the worst.
   ``We were looking for the long haul,'' his mother, Kitty Dooley,
said Monday from Hopkinsville, Ky. ``We didn't dream we'd have him
with us ... that we'd be calling out with joy.''
   Dooley, 40, was among hundreds of Americans freed earlier this
month by Saddam Hussein.
   ``I was artfully eluding capture. That was the goal of my days.
It was lonely ... tense, nervous,'' said Dooley, who managed
restaurants for a Kuwaiti company. ``Two weeks ago, I certainly had
no plans to be here, to be home for Christmas.
   ``Freedom is what's important. Even to take out the trash is a
treat.''
   The Rev. Edwin Davis will say a special grace for his son-in-law
before the traditional holiday supper. His daughter's husband, like
many Kuwaitis married to Americans, stayed behind to defend his
country and relatives.
   ``We're happy that Martha and the two grandchildren are back
home safely with us, but we're still praying for Mike,'' Davis said
from Koran, La. ``We just hope he can get out of there before
there's a war. We're wondering about a war.''
   Global worries aside, freed hostages want to spend the time
trying to relax and enjoy a respite from tensions that have
dominated recent months.
   ``You can't help but think about the politics and the troops
over there,'' said Guy Seago, an oil worker who was used as a
so-called human shield.
   ``But for me the focus this Christmas is on faith,'' the father
of six said from Johnson City, Tenn. ``It's on faith and thanks and
quiet time with the family.''
   James E. Carroll's wife and seven children had a Christmas tree
waiting when he arrived home in Augusta, Ga.
   ``It's just a special Christmas ... of being thankful to the
Lord,'' said Carroll, a pediatrician who also holed up at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   Another family had not planned to have Christmas this year.
   ``We weren't going to celebrate,'' said Margaret Williams of
Germantown, Tenn., whose son and daughter-in-law were held by Iraqi
troops.
   And now the holiday has become a little anticlimactic.
   ``Our Christmas already came,'' Mrs. Williams said. ``It came
when we saw them home and safe. It came when they were free and
back here with us.''

   Single mother Valerie Bodon wanted to shower
her four sons with gifts and cook a scrumptious Christmas feast
today - but there was no money. Luckily, she wasn't too proud to
ask for help.
   For Mrs. Bodon, who tries to make ends meet with food stamps and
a $405 monthly government check, the help came from a small
Indianapolis group that prefers to remain anonymous.
   Delivered to her door last week were about 30 wrapped gifts,
four stockings stuffed with candy, fruit and other treats, a
miniature, decorated Christmas tree and two gift certificates from
a supermarket and discount shoe store.
   Mrs. Bodon has been studying accounting at Butler University so
she can get a better job. She was divorced three years ago while
working as an accounting clerk, a job that did not pay enough to
support the family.
   Knowing she had virtually nothing to give her boys for
Christmas, she went to one of the 14 Community Centers of
Indianapolis in November to ask for help.
   The non-profit agency, which provided Christmas assistance to
more than 3,500 families last year, brings together people who want
to help with those who need it, spokesman Ward Beckham said.
   ``She's trying to go to school, trying to raise a family, trying
to keep her budget balanced,'' said Mike Waddell, her counselor at
one of the centers. ``She impressed me as somebody who's going to
be a real success when she starts working.''
   Many other families are in similar circumstances. Most are
headed by single mothers trying to get by on welfare. Others are
elderly people on Social Security.
   The Community Centers of Indianapolis help families when they
are behind on their rent or utility bills or when the cupboards are
empty.
   At Christmas, the centers work with stores and groups such as
Kmart, the Fire Department, Marine reservists, supermarkets,
service clubs and the gas company, which donate money, food or
toys, Beckham said.
   Affluent churches funnel help through the community centers or
churches that serve the poor.
   Yet the churches and agencies can help only those who ask for
it. Some children will have empty stockings because their parents
are either too proud, embarrassed or drug-addicted to seek help,
officials say.
   ``A lot of children don't get the Christmas they want. A few
don't get the Christmas they need,'' said Cindy Clements, executive
director of Christamore House, another of the centers.
   With the extra help from her anonymous benefactors, Mrs. Bodon
will be able to give her children more than they could have
expected.
   ``I'm just happy that somebody is doing this for me,'' she said.
``As long as the tree isn't bare on Christmas, then they'll be
satisfied.''

   For the second year in a row, a Christmas
firebug torched a front-lawn Nativity scene, police said.
   After the elaborate Christmas display the Scaringi family of
Monsey puts up every year was set ablaze last Decemeber, the family
installed an alarm system to deter arsonists.
   The alarm went off at about 1:30 a.m. Monday, but the damage was
done. The family woke up to see the figures in the Nativity scene
burning.
   The fire was doused by firefighters and police, but the
Christmas display was destroyed. Ramapo Police Lt. Guy Estead said
the fire was intentionally set. No arrests were made.
   There was no damage to the home and no injuries. Anthony
Scaringi is offering a $3,000 reward to help catch the culprit.

<HEAD>Cambodia Again Faces Serious Food Shortage</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia, a nation ravaged by war and
revolution for the past 20 years, is again facing severe food
shortages because of increased fighting, drought and floods, United
Nations officials say.
   Some refugees who say they cannot grow rice are among the
roughly 20,000 Cambodians who fled west to guerrilla-controlled
camps in Thailand this year. Thousands of others went east to areas
under government control.
   Government officials in Phnom Penh expect that Cambodia's 8
million people will be shot about 100,000 tons of rice in 1991, or
three times the official deficit for this year, Scott Leiper of the
U.N. World Food Program told donor countries at a Dec. 18 meeting.
   ``The situation is causing concern,'' said S.A.M.S. Kibria, the
U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Cambodian aid
programs.
   ``From all indications the food situation had improved over the
last couple of years,'' he said in an interview Monday. ``This
year, because of the fighting, a lot of the land was left
uncultivated. Secondly, the rainfall both in terms of quantity and
timing was not right.''
   Another major factor, he said, was that the Soviets have stopped
providing fertilizer as a result of their general disengagement
from Cambodia.
   Cambodia had been getting about 50,000 tons of fertilizer
annually, but only a fifth of that amount was available for the
1990 wet season crop, Leiper said.
   The Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh is battling
three guerrilla groups, and fighting has spread since the
Vietnamese troop pullout that began in September 1989.
   Each year, combat intensifies during the dry season that has
just begun.
   The U.N. Security Council has drawn up a peace plan to end the
civil war in Cambodia, but representatives of the warring factions
failed during talks in Paris last weekend to agree on all parts of
the plan.
   Millions died in Cambodia in the 1970-75 civil war, the 1975-78
bloody rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, and in the fighting since
late 1978 when invading Vietnamese troops drove the Khmer Rouge
into the jungles.
   Western isolation of the communist Phnom Penh government has
kept the country impoverished.
   Leiper, head of the World Food Program's Phnom Penh office, told
the donor countries that the shortages are expected to hit hardest
in southwestern Kampot and Kompongspeu provinces, which have
suffered ``alarming'' food shortages due to drought the past two
years.
   They are expected to face a combined food deficit of 44,000 tons
of rice in 1991 - about 40 percent of the total nationwide deficit.
   Leiper said prolonged drought in many areas of the central and
southeastern provinces has reduced the area planted, and flooding
in the west and the fighting has also reduced cultivation.
   Cambodia's official SPK news agency recently said drought and
floods had destroyed more than half the cultivated area in the
central province of Kompong Thom.
   It said the average yield was expected to drop by a third
compared to last year in the northwestern province of Battambang, a
main agricultural region, due to bad weather and guerilla
harassment.
   Leiper also requested aid for the 130,000 people, many living in
dire conditions, who have been displaced in government-held
territory this past year. Getting them food, he said, has been
hampered by shortages of trucks and fuel, and the country's
battered infrastructure.
   International aid officials say about 90 percent of these people
had fled the fighting in the western provinces of Battambang and
Banteay Meanchey.
   The World Food Program moved cautiously in appealing for aid
because some of the other refugees, in Kompongspeu and Kompong
Chhnang provinces, said the government had moved them out of their
villages because of guerrilla infiltration.
   At the donor meeting, Sweden pledged $6.6 million for aid inside
Cambodia. The United States pledged $10 million and the European
Community $6 million to help about 300,000 refugees in Thai border
camps controlled by the guerrillas.

   Santa appeared in the Persian Gulf
on Christmas Eve, alighting aboard this hospital ship with a full
complement of reindeer.
   It was not completely a surprise visit.
   Fifteen minutes beforehand, the public address system crackled
to life to announce that AWACS surveillance planes high overhead
were reporting a ``single unidentified aircraft'' closing in on the
ship.
   The craft was moving too slowly to be intercepted by Navy F-15
fighter jets, later announcements said.
   Finally came the report it was ``a sleigh pulled by deer and
driven by an old man.'' The jingle of bells on the address system
heralded its arrival.
   Santa's real identity was the ship's air boss, Cmdr. Stanley
Schmidt. He handed out packages addressed to ``any service
member.'' Nurses and corpsmen perched on his lap as he sat on a
cargo dolly decorated like a sleigh.
   Pulling the dolly were seven men and women wearing cardboard
reindeer antlers stuck high over their ears. Lead reindeer Rudolph
- actually Cmdr. Dan Barrett, 44, of Flint, Mich., the ship's
lawyer - had a bulbous red nose.
   The singalong right after the visit included such highlights as
``Rashid The Red Nosed Camel'' and ``Two Dinars,'' an ode to the
high fares of Bahrain taxi drivers.
   In other Christmas events, the movie ``Miracle on 34th Street''
was playing in O Lounge.
   The Catholic chaplain, The Rev. Richard Mattie, 58, scheduled a
Midnight Mass and both he and Protestant chaplain Lt. Cmdr. Doug
Weadick, 40, planned an ecumenical service. Both are from Hornell,
N.Y.
   Weadick said his Christmas message would concentrate on ``being
able to relinquish your life to the powers that be ... on having to
sacrifice our individualism for the common good.''
   Mattie said he planned to talk about ``the price we have to pay
to preserve peace.''
   The only Christmas religious service being held in public for
Operation Desert Shield was on the Mercy. Like other Navy ships in
international waters, it is not subject to Saudi Arabian law which
bans all religions except Islam.
   The 1,000-bed hospital is decorated throughout with trees,
cards, baubles and paintings sent by schoolchildren from the United
States.
   There are 35 patients on board, including one brought on Sunday
from an auto accident in the United Arab Emirates in which two
seaman died. He was in stable condition in intensive care after
being in surgery all night.
   The ship is back at sea after an 18-day port call that included
being fitted with a chemical alarm system.
   Cmdr. Debra Wear, the psychiatrist aboard the floating hospital,
said there had been some depression among the people she had seen
but not as much as one would expect.
   ``It's missing a son's first steps, everything's a little more
poignant and felt more acutely over the holidays. But it's more
people having the blues, it's not significant depression.''

<HEAD>Christmas Sales Still Sluggish Despite 11th-Hour Rush</HEAD>

   When all the receipts are tallied, Christmas
sales are likely to be unchanged or barely above last year, a poor
season for retailers who couldn't overcome consumer worries over
the economy and Middle East.
   Shopping traffic was slow at many stores and malls this season
and consumers who did shop bought selectively. High-profile
retailing companies around the country complained Monday their
sales were a disappointment.
   Sales that are unchanged or barely higher are considered poor,
because after the rate of inflation is subtracted, a store's
business may be down from year-earlier levels. Consumer prices rose
6.4 percent through the first 11 months of this year, meaning many
stores' modest gains were wiped out.
   ``It has not been a disaster, but it has been a pretty flat
season,'' said Suzanne McMillan, senior vice president for
marketing at Saks Fifth Avenue.
   ``It's not going to be anything that's going to excite
anybody,'' said Kenneth Macke, chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp. The
company's sales will be unchanged or perhaps 1 percent higher than
last year, Macke said.
   Many retailers increased or moved up price reductions in the
last few weeks in an effort to draw more shoppers. Nationwide
chains reported their worst results came in the Northeast, where
the recesssion has hit particularly hard.
   The first inkling of real trouble among retailers came back in
August as sales of clothing, furniture, toys and appliances stalled
in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Sales for most retailers failed to ick up in the early fall, a
time when business normally accelerates. When the Christmas season
kicked off, sales remained slow although they picked up some steam
during the last week.
   In many areas, weather extremes also hampered holiday sales.
   Younkers Inc., a Des Moines-based chain of 34 Midwestern
department stores, said its December sales, which rose between 2
percent and 3 percent, would have been higher if not for heavy
snows and frigid temperatures.
   ``We did very well considering the weather,'' said Younkers
president W. Thomas Gould. Younkers' sales were 2 percent to 3
percent higher than last year, a better year than most retailers,
especially those with higher-priced items.
   In parts of the country where temperatures have been in the 50s
and 60s for much of December, the warm weather dealt a blow to
winter clothing sales. Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, was among the stores that moved up apparel clearance
sales because the merchandise was not moving.
   Results at Dayton Hudson, whose stores range from upscale
department stores to the Target discount chain, reflected the fact
that consumers were ``trading down,'' or buying cheaper gifts.
   What shoppers bought also reflected the difficult season. Dayton
Hudson had more success with Levi's jeans than with designer jeans,
and sweatshirts and sweatpants were among the most popular items,
Macke said.
   ``It was a very functional Christmas,'' he said.
   Macke said the poor Christmas does not bode well for the first
half of 1991. ``If Santa Claus and Christmas can't bring people
into the stores, why are they going to be in in January and
February?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Order Feeding of Dying Woman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the seventh time, a court refused
to order a hospital to resume feeding Nancy Cruzan, the severely
brain-injured woman whose family won her right to die.
   Meanwhile on Christmas Eve, eight anti-euthanasia demonstrators
huddled -without their tent - outside the building where she lay
dying. Protesters have maintained a round-the-clock vigil since Ms.
Cruzan's feeding tube was removed Dec. 14.
   The court decision Monday came in response to a request by the
Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney of Boca Raton, Fla., who argued the state
was violating Ms. Cruzan's rights by not ordering her to be fed.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-page order
that said Mahoney had no standing in the case. Mahoney said he
would take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The U.S. District Court for Western Missouri had earlier
dismissed Mahoney's suit.
   Ms. Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since an
auto crash in early 1983. Doctors give her n chance of recovery.
She remained in deteriorating condition today.
   Also Monday, authorities ordered demonstrators outside the
Missouri Rehabilitation Center to remove a tent they had erected.
When protesters refused, hospital employees took it down.
   The demonstrators had been using a torch in the tent to combat
the bone-chilling weather. The arrangement was considered a fire
hazard and once temperatures warmed into the 20s Monday, hospital
officials order it removed, hospital director Don Lamkins said.
   In a landmark ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court said earlier this
year Missouri could require ``clear and convincing'' evidence that
a person in Ms. Cruzan's condition would want to die.
   Jasper County Judge Charles Teel then heard testimony from
friends who said Ms. Cruzan would want to die and ruled her parents
could have the feeding tube removed.
   The latest appeals court ruling was the seventh time a court had
refused to order feeding of Ms. Cruzan resumed.
   Mahoney's motion said the state was violating Ms. Cruzan's
rights and argued the hearing Teel held was improper because
witnesses who testified were not cross-examined and there were no
witnesses who said Ms. Cruzan should be kept alive.
   Mahoney also argued that the state had erred by not appealing
Teel's order.
   The clergyman filed his action under a legal concept called
``next of friend,'' describing it as a strategy to be used when no
one else was protecting the rights of a person.
   In taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, Mahoney said he
would cite testimony from the former chaplain at the hospital who
said Ms. Cruzan had a noticeable reaction when he told her she was
going to die.
   Unlike comatose patients, Ms. Cruzan opens her eyes and changes
her facial expressions, but doctors testified her lack of
consciousness was irreversible and she had no awareness and could
not feel pain.
   Mahoney is director of the Center for Christian Activities, a
right-to-life group associated with the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue.

<HEAD>American Alleges Pilots Are Staging a Sickout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines accused its pilots of staging a
sickout during one of the busiest travel times of the year to
protest stalled contract talks.
   American, based in Forth Worth, said the number of pilots
calling in sick over the weekend before Christmas soared to record
numbers. The absentee rate was almost 70 percent higher than
normal, airline officials said.
   Union officials denied any organized protest was occurring but
conceded that disgruntled employees could be acting on their own.
   American management and the Allied Pilots Association have been
negotiating a contract for 14 months but have made little headway.
   ``It's all an attempt to compel the company to agree to terms
that the pilots would like us to on the contract,'' said Robert W.
Baker, American executive vice president for operations.
   Baker said 529 of American's 9,000 pilots were on sick leave
Monday. About 500 pilots had called in sick over the weekend. The
pilot absentee rate is about 250 normally and 300 during Christmas
holidays, American spokesman Marty Heires said.
   ``We have to assume there's some union activity here,'' Heires
said. ``Now, I don't know whether this was an organized effort or
whether some pilots are taking it upon themselves to do this.
   ``All we're seeing is the end result. We've had an approximate
67 percent increase in the number of pilots calling in sick,'' he
said.
   Union officials denied a concerted effort is behind the higher
absentee rate.
   ``I know there's nothing going on in terms of any grassroots
operation or any other type of operation to call in sick or not
being available,'' AA executive director Scott Peterson said.
   Baker said the absentee rate for flight attendants was average.
   The apparent pilot sickout, coupled with bad weather, a high
volume of holiday traffic and the airline's loss of 230 pilots to
Operation Desert Shield led to an unusually high number of flight
cancellations over the weekend, Heires said.
   American canceled 74 flights, or one in every 11 flights, into
and out of its hub at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
during Sunday's holiday crunch.
   A sickout would be illegal under the Railway Labor Act, which
also covers airlines.
   Both management and labor traded contract proposals in the past
month but remain far apart. Negotiations resume Jan. 7 in
Washington under the auspices of federal mediators.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the existing contract will remain
in force until a federal mediator declares an impasse. After a
30-day cooling off period, the carrier may impose new terms on the
pilots and the union can strike.
   The union has been urging members to be diligent about seeking
sick leave when ill and not to answer their phones if they don't
want to work on their days off.
   ``Although the company may be disappointed in that, there's
nothing illegal about it,'' said APA spokesman Tom Hunt. ``What's
the reason for that? I think it's low morale. There's no question
the pilots at American Airlines are extremely disgruntled with the
company, with management.''

<HEAD>Freeze Devastates California Orange Crop, Damages Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worst freeze since 1937 devastated
California's navel orange crop, sending growers into Christmas with
little hope of salvaging the season's harvest.
   ``This is way worse than I've ever seen,'' Bakersfield-area
grower John Slikker Jr. said Monday. ``Yesterday, we cut these
oranges in half. ... It was just like cutting through a Popsicle.''
   The weekend Arctic blast also damaged nursery plants, lemons and
avocados and destroyed most early Southern California strawberries,
agriculture officials said. Crop damage was put in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Cliff Holland of California Citrus Mutual, a growers
organization, admitted the string of freezing nights probably
destroyed the state's 1990-91 navel orange harvest.
   ``It will take some time to assess damage, but it looks bleak at
this point,'' he said. About 80 percent of the 1990-91 crop,
estimated at between 60 million cartons and 80 million cartons,
remained on the trees, Holland said.
   Most of California's navel oranges are sold on the fresh market.
Florida oranges, in contrast, are used mostly for juice and juice
concentrate; those that sustain frost damage can sometimes be
salvaged for juice processing.
   The Sunkist Growers Inc. cooperative said early estimates
indicated that at least half the citrus crop sustained frost
damage, spokeswoman Claire Peters said. She added that growers hope
to salvage some for juice.
   ``There will be fewer fruit and what there is will cost more,''
Peters said.
   Inmporters of Chilean fruit, like Los Angeles-based David
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., expected demand for foreign fruit to increase as
markets scramble to make up for local losses.
   It was ``freeze-of-the-century stuff,'' said Dave Carman of the
National Weather Service. ``This is probably the second-coldest
freeze of the century. We are dealing with extreme record cold.''
   Since Friday, temperatures throughout the San Joaquin Valley
citrus region had dipped to 20 degrees and below and were forecast
to drop into the teens early today. It was the worst freeze since
1937, officials said.
   Navel oranges begin to show damage if temperatures fall to 25 or
26 degrees and stay at that level or below for at least four hours,
Holland said.
   ``Basically, I have written off the crop that is on the tree,''
said Chris Caviglia, a Tulare County grower. ``What I'm concerned
about now is the crop for next year. I could very well lose it as
well if the trees aren't protected.''
   The navels were more vulnerable than normal this season because
they were about two weeks late in maturing, leaving the rinds too
thin to ward off much cold. California navels are harvested between
November and June.
   The 1989 navel orange crop was valued at $248 million, compared
to $1.29 billion in Florida orange production that year.
   Losses in Tulare County, which produces most of the state's
navel oranges, were expected to be about $200 million, said county
Agriculture Commissioner Lenord Craft. State officials said most
strawberries were lost but provided no dollar figure for the
damage.
   In Ventura County, losses to lemons, avocados and nursery
stocks, or nonfood-bearing plants, totaled at least $100 million,
said Jim Fulmer, deputy agricultural commissioner.
   About one-fifth of the state's avocados, which account for 90
percent of national consumption, were lost, said Mark Affleck,
president of the California Avocado Commission.
   The extent of damage to vegetable fields in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys wasn't known, but some farmers reported losses.
   Joe P. Prandini, general manager of Betteravia Farms Co., said
he lost about 35 percent of the cauliflower grown on his 4,000-acre
farm.
   Holland said California growers have been fortunate in avoiding
devastating freezes in the past. Some have saved for a bad year,
but others will be hurt.
   ``I talk to growers who try to keep a minimum of one year's
farming costs in the bank, but we also have people in the industry
with tremendous debt on groves,'' he said. ``There are going to be
some hard times.''

<HEAD>Parolees Charged With Capital Homicide In Double Slaying Laugh in
Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two recent parolees accused of killing a
grandmother and her daughter, and shooting the younger woman's
husband in the face before kidnapping two of their daughters joked
with each other in court during their arraignment on murder
charges.
   Von Lester Taylor, 25, and Edward Steven Deli, 21, were formally
charged Monday with two counts each of first-degree murder, a
capital offense in Utah, attempted murder, arson, two counts of
kidnapping and robbery.
   The defendants, parolees who walked away from a halfway house
while purportedly out looking for jobs, were in jovial spirits at
their arraignment, whispering to each other and sharing a few
laughs.
   They disputed claims that a police officer fired just two shots
at them before they surrendered. They said he fired at least a
dozen times.
   Taylor and Deli are accused in the Saturday shooting deaths of
Beth Harmon Tidwell Potts, mid-70s, of Murray, and her daughter,
Kay Tidwell Tiede, 51, of Humble, Texas. The two women were found
dead at the family cabin east of Oakley.
   Mrs. Tiede's husband, Rolf, 51, was shot in the face and taken
by helicopter to the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake
City, where he was released Monday, the hospital said.
   The victims surprised their attackers during a burglary, police
said.
   The two men also were accused of setting the cabin on fire and
abducting two of the Tiedes daughters, Linae, 20, and Tricia, 16,
before fleeing with them in the family's car.
   The Summit County sheriff's office was alerted by a caller who
reported hearing shots and seeing two men fleeing with two young
women. With police giving chase, they drove at speeds above 100 mph
before losing control of the car about 10 miles from the cabin,
according to court documents.
   Deli allegedly got out of the car and aimed a handgun at
authorities and was then fired at by a Kamas police officer.
   The daughters were found inside the car unharmed.
   Before the proceeding, the men asked reporters if the story of
the killings had been broadcast nationwide. When told it had,
witnesses said they smiled. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for
Jan. 8. The two men were ordered held without bail. In addition to
the more serious charges, Deli was charged with assault and Taylor
was charged with failure to respond to an officer's order to stop.
   The Summit County sheriff's office said the victims were part of
a Humble, Texas family spending the holidays at the cabin about 45
miles east of Salt Lake City.
   Taylor and Deli were parolees from Utah State Prison who had
been staying at the Orange Street Community Center in Salt Lake
City, corrections department spokesman Dave Franchina said. They
were declared walkaways from the halfway house when they failed to
return from job hunting on Dec. 14.
   Taylor, who was serving a 1- to 15-year term for aggravated
burglary, was paroled Oct. 23 and transferred to the halfway house
on Nov. 23. Deli, imprisoned in 1989 on 5-year maximum term for
arson, was paroled Nov. 27.

<HEAD>Alaska Officials Updating Pipeline Security In Face of Possible
War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The prospect of war in the Middle East
has military and civilian security forces making extra sure they're
ready to protect the 800-mile-long trans-Alaska oil pipeline from
terrorists.
   America's most important oil lifeline also may be its most
vulnerable, far removed from the continental United States and
surrounded by wilderness.
   Its safety rests largely on a private firm under contract to
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of oil companies
running the pipeline, with plans for support from Alaska State
Troopers, the Alaska National Guard and the Air Force, officials
said.
   Security along the pipeline, at pump stations and the 1,000-acre
tanker loading terminal in Valdez was tightened after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in August, Alyeska officials said.
   Beyond that, security plans to combat terrorist threats are
being upgraded at the request of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   ``In August, I raised the question several times about the
status of the contingency plans for the protection of the
pipeline,'' Stevens said. Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, commander of
the 11th Air Force in Alaska, was involved in the talks, he said.
   ``I'm assured there have been some meetings that have explored
the degree of cooperation and coordination necessary'' to defend
the pipeline, he said. ``They have (a) good (plan). I asked them to
dust it off and make sure everybody understood it.''
   The trans-Alaska oil pipeline, completed in 1977, is the jugular
of domestic oil production. About 2 million barrels a day of North
Slope crude - one quarter of all U.S. output - is pumped from
Prudhoe Bay fields to the ice-free port of Valdez.
   Alyeska, National Guard and other federal officials would not
discuss specific aspects of pipeline security, saying it reveal too
much to terrorists.
   ``We are working on a draft plan,'' National Guard spokeswoman
Kristine Schuster said. ``Alyeska is the lead agency here. ... The
National Guard has been asked to give their input.''
   ``I don't talk about it,'' said J.P. ``Pat'' Wellington, manager
of corporate security for Alyeska. He oversees Alyeska's contract
with American Guard Alert, Inc., which is in charge of physical
security on the $9 billion pipeline.
   ``We are aware of what the security plans are, and we are happy
with them,'' said Dave Vickery, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management, which with the federal Department of
Transportation and the state Division of Natural Resources monitors
the pipeline.
   The 48-inch pipe, half of it buried and half of it elevated, was
laid across 575 miles of BLM-managed land. It crosses 34 major
rivers and 800 smaller streams. Seventy-thousand people helped
build it.
   At least two telephone threats warning of possible attacks on
the pipeline were reported in recent weeks, but neither claim could
be substantiated and officials declined to discuss them.
   ``It's our policy not to confirm or deny the receipt of
threats,'' said Tom Matthews, chief FBI agent in Alaska.
   Meanwhile, a source familiar with Alyeska security who asked not
to be identified, said the pipeline company has been considering
subscribing to a terrorism forecasting service.
   Despite the official worries, terrorism specialist Mike Ackerman
of Ackerman Associates in Miami said the pipeline is an unlikely
target of Arab extremists.
   Terrorists, if they strike inside the U.S., would probably hit
public targets such as airports in Detroit or New York City,
Ackerman said.
   And a possible attack on the pipeline would be unlikely to shut
down oil flow for a significant period of time, he said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with hard-line Iranian newspaper rejecting
Rushdie's concessions. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hard-line Tehran newspaper today
rejected Salman Rushdie's efforts to end Moslem anger over his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' It said the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death edict still stands.
   The British author announced Monday that he has embraced Islam
and will not allow the book to be published in paperback. He also
pledged that he would no longer seek to have the novel published in
other languages.
   The novel has sold 1 million copies and already been translated
into 15 languages. The book is banned by 20 countries.
   The Abrar daily said in an editorial that ``Khomeini's historic
edict on Rushdie is irrevocable even if he (Rushdie) repents.''
   In February 1989, the Iranian fundamentalist patriarch called on
Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming
Islam in ``The Satanic Verses.'' Iran subsequently offered a $1
million bounty for Rushdie's death.
   Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.
   Rushdie announced his concessions to Moslems in a statement
released in London by one of several Islamic leaders with whom he
met in secret on Monday.
   Hesham el-Essawy, president of the Islamic Society for the
Promotion of Religious Tolerance, said Rushdie had typed the
statement himself.
   Essawy said Rushdie, who was born to a Moslem family in India
and had previously said he did not consider himself a religious
Moslem, now had ``a clean slate'' with the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems.
   But Abrar dismissed Rushdie's efforts as part of ``propaganda
maneuvers by the British government aimed at bringing Rushdie out
of isolation and making Moslems neglect'' Khomeini's edict.
   Although Essawy said that he and two other prominent Moslem
scholars met with Rushdie, the newspaper claimed ``no British
Moslem leader ... could confirm any such meeting.''
   Iran severed relations with Britain over the Rushdie affair,
accusing the London government of defaming Islam by allowing ``The
Satanic Verses'' to be published.
   Relations were resumed Sept. 27 after British officials conceded
that Rushdie's book offended Moslems and that London had no wish to
offend Islam.
   The resumption of relations came amid efforts by Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of his country's so-called
pragmatists, to build bridges with the West following the June 1989
death of Khomeini.
   The Iranians have not rescinded Khomeini's death sentence on
Rushdie, claiming it is a religious edict that cannot be revoked.
But Rafsanjani and his supporters have indicated they are prepared
to allow the decree to lapse.
   Abrar's editorial reflected the thinking of hard-line radicals
opposed to Rafsanjani's drive to boost relations with the West and
Iran's Arab neighbors, as well as liberalize Iranian society.
   Rafsanjani has largely marginalized the radicals in a power
struggle, but they continue to snipe at him.
   Rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference Monday
that it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death
sentence. But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt
yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide object to Rushdie's use of the names of
the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   Some Moslem leaders in Britain were not satisfied with Rushdie's
concessions, demanding that hardcover editions of ``The Satanic
Verses'' be removed from bookstore shelves.
   Sher Azam of the Council for Mosques in Bradford in northern
England, where the book had been publicly burned, sad:
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on.''

   A woman in a Santa Claus outfit greeted
the first group of soldiers to unwind aboard a cruise liner
offering Western-style diversions for Persian Gulf troops.
   The Pentagon paid $31 million for a six-month lease for the
Cunard Princess, which features a swimming pool, two Jacuzzis,
tennis courts, a nightclub, bars and a 40-foot black marble dance
floor.
   Military officials in Saudi Arabia note there have been special
problems in finding ways for U.S. soldiers to relax in a country

   The first group of desert-weary soldiers boarded Christmas Eve

been in the desert since the beginning of the operation,'' said a
U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Neuhart.
   Men and women from all branches of the military will be rotated
every three days aboard the ship, which can accommodate 800 guests.
   Neuhart said ``there will be two to a cabin, but males and
females will not be able to share rooms.''
   ``Both officers and enlisted personnel will be on the ship
together, however, most likely separated,'' he added.
   Entertainers other than the visiting USO shows are featured on
the ship. Alcohol can be purchased on the ship at duty-free costs.
Physicians and clergy will also be assigned to the liner.
   Cunard employees are staffing the ship, which will remain
berthed while soldiers are on board.
   A second Cunard ship should be leased soon by the military,
officials said.
   American and British families in Bahrain invited hundreds of
military personnel to share a Christmas meal and other holiday
festivities with them.

   Pope John Paul II prayed in his Christmas
message today that political leaders will choose patience and
dialogue over a war in the Persian Gulf, and noted that the Holy
Land is also without peace.
   ``The light of Christ is with the tormented nations of the
Middle East. For the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for
the threat of conflict to disappear. May leaders be convinced that
war is an adventure with no return.'' ``By reasoning, patience and
dialogue with respect for the inalienable rights of peoples and
nations, it is possible to identify and travel the paths of
understanding and peace.
   ``The Holy Land, too, has been awaiting this peace for years: a
peaceful solution to the whole question which concerns it, a
solution which takes into account the legitimate expectations of
the Palestinian people and of the people which lives in the state
of Israel,'' the pope said.
   The pope, speaking from the central balcony of St. Peter's
Basilica above a rain-drenched St. Peter's Square, also warned
Europeans to resist materialism in wake of the ``tumbled walls of
ideological and political opposition.''
   In his traditional Christmas Day noon message ``urbi et orbi'' -
Latin for ``to the city (of Rome) and the world'' - John Paul
prayed that the light of Christmas also shine in Africa, ``where
peace and harmony between different peoples and traditions is
disrupted by fratricidal struggles, where hope for peace is still
fragile and must be strengthened.''
   After delivering the message, the pope wished the world
Christmas joy in 53 languages, beginning in Italian and ended in
Latin, the official language of the Roman Catholic church.
   The downpours which soaked Rome on Christmas Eve day and early
today stopped shortly before the pope's main late-morning Christmas
Mass in the basilica.
   The bad weather apparently kept the turnout down in the square,
with only about 10,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims gathered to
hear the pope's message. Past years have seen crowds in the tens of
thousands.
   The pope, wearing a white robe and a gold-banded, double-peaked
hat, came out onto the balcony after saying Mass on the high altar
of the basilica.
   Potted poinsettias sat snug around the bases of the twisted
bronze columns supporting Bernini's canopy above the altar, which
was ringed with bunches of yellow daisies and sprays of forsythia.

   Pope John Paul II today prayed for world leaders to avoid war in
the Persian Gulf and said the Palestinians must be considered in
efforts for peace in the ``tormented nations of the Middle East.''
   ``For the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for the
threat of conflict to disappear,'' the pope said in a Christmas
message delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica
in Vatican City.
   He also said a peaceful solution in Israeli-occupied lands must
take ``into account the legitimate expectations of the Palestinian
people.''
   ``The light of Christ is with the tormented nations of the
Middle East,'' the pontiff said.
   The fear of Palestinian unrest and the gulf crisis left the West
Bank town of Bethlehem with one of its smallest Christmas crowds in
recent memory.
   ``For us, Christmas is an event of peace, and here you cannot
feel peace,''said German tourist Gabriele Beitz in Manger Square,
near the grotto where tradition holds that Christ was born.
   The Christmas mood elsewhere in the Middle East was also anxious
as U.S. troops in the gulf were placed on a heightened state of
alert to guard against terrorist attacks.
   But soldiers still managed to mark the holiday with carols,
decorations and desert religious services.
   Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations were canceled by the town's
Palestinian officials in solidarity with the three-year uprising
against Israeli occupation. Most shops and restaurants were closed.
   In past years, the town was crowded with pilgrims during
Christmas and the streets were awash in colorful lights.
   But only several hundred people were in Manger Square as
midnight Mass began at nearby St. Catherine's Church.
   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabah, prayed
for a peaceful resolution of the gulf conflict.
   Jesus ``shows us the way of love we need today on the eve of a
world war, especially under these circumstances, we need peace,''
he said in Arabic and French.
   Security was especially heavy in Bethlehem because of a wave of
Arab attacks on Israelis after the Oct. 8 riot on Jerusalem's
Temple Mount in which Israeli police killed 17 Palestinians.
   As a Christmas gesture, the military announced it was releasing
217 Palestinian prisoners. Most had less than a month to go in
their sentences.
   For the estimated 300,000 U.S. troops in the gulf, Christmas
festivities were muted by Saudi law that forbids practice of all
religions except Islam.
   Carols such as ``Silent Night'' were sung behind closed tent
flaps, and military chaplains were renamed morale officers before
holding low-key services.
   Some soldiers, however, had some lively holiday diversions.
   The cruise liner Cunard Princess was turned into a Christmas Eve
party spot off Bahrain, where a woman dressed as Santa Claus
greeted troops on the gangplank. The Pentagon paid $31 million to
lease the ship for six months for the troops.
   Comedian Bob Hope was also in the gulf, keeping to his longtime
tradition of entertaining U.S. troops at Christmas.
   Britain's Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie today said war
in the gulf could only be justified ``if and when all other means
of persuasion have failed.''
   ``In such a combat thousands could suffer and die,'' said
Runcie, who was a decorated tank officer in World War II.
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II thanked the multinational forces
in the gulf for ``resisting the bully and the tyrant.'' She also
condemned attacks by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland,
where 75 people have died in violence so far this year.
   Germans marked their first Christmas since unification with a
gesture of friendship to the Soviet Union.
   Money was collected to help ease the Soviet food shortage and
some people in former East Germany invited Red Army soldiers over
for the holiday.
   ``It's heart-to-heart contact, people to people,'' said Klaus
Wuest of Berlin, whose family spend Christmas Eve with a
19-year-old Soviet soldier. ``The old regime was based on suspicion
and hatred. Now we can be friendly.''
   Dramatic changes were also celebrated in Albania, where a
23-year-old ban on religion was lifted in November.
   Roman Catholic priest Simon Jubani, who was jailed eight times
by the former Stalinist regime, led Christmas Mass in a rundown
chapel the northern city of Shkodra.
   ``For the first time in 23 years, there will be midnight Mass,''
Jubani said. ``Merry Christmas.''
   In state-controlled churches in China, worshipers and the
curious joined in prayer and song.
   For many in China, an officially atheist country, Christmas is
viewed as an exotic foreign holiday. But department stores and
hotels catering to foreigners often feature Christmas themes.
   ``I am not a believer,'' said one student who attended a service
in Beijing, ``but I know this day is very important to some people
here and people everywhere. I just want to learn a little about
it.''

   Here is the Vatican's official English
translation of the annual Christmas ``Urbi et Orbi'' (to the city
and to the world) message given by Pope John Paul II on Tuesday:
   ---
   At midnight the prophet Isaiah spoke to us. With inspired voice
he proclaimed: ``The people who walked in darkness have seen a
great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them
has light shined.'' (Isaiah 9:2)
   A light has shined. Only the light seen by the shepherds at
Bethlehem? Was it only that light which shone on the horizon?
   In truth, that light became a guiding sign, like the star which
guided the Wise Men from the East. The light shone in a different
way. It shone more clearly. To man's interior eyes God has revealed
himself.
   In broad daylight the evangelist speaks to us, the apostle John:
``The true light that enlightens every man was coming into the
world.'' (John 1:9). This light is born in God. It comes from God,
It is God.
   It is the eternal word. The word is the Son, one of being with
the Father, ``God from God, light from light.'' The word has come
into the world. The word was made flesh.
   ``In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light
shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.''
(John 1:4-5).
   The night persists. The night of advent. The peoples walk in
darkness - yet the light is with them: the word who was made flesh
in the midst of the nations. The word, in whom the unknowable God
has made himself known to mankind, the word who is the Son.
   In him the word is eternally known and eternally loved. And he
is the measure of this love, the divine measure: ``For God so loved
the world that he gave his only Son.'' (John 3:16).
   The divine measure of love is the Gift: it is the Son as a gift.
As the absolute gift, not comparable with other gifts: God - man.
   In him is life.
   Above the heritage of death, present in the world, man inherits
the life which is from God; he inherits it in the Son, who became
man on Bethlehem night and was born of the Virgin Mary. He was born
by the power of the Holy Spirit, through whom is realized the
absolute gift.
   The night persists. The night of advent. The peoples walk in
darkness - yet with them is this absolute gift.
   He is present: the spirit of truth, revealed in the Son and by
the Son.
   The light of the Son ceases not to be with man through the power
of the spirit, who bears witness to him.
   He bears witness to the word who was made flesh and, on
Bethlehem night, has come to dwell among us. Our earthly eyes see
the child placed in a manger (cf. Luke 2:7), while the eyes of
faith see the glory ``glory as of the only Son from the Father full
of grace and truth.'' (John 1:14).
   On this day we ask for light: we ask that the eyes of our hearts
be enlightened (cf. Ephesians 1:18). We ask for harmony and unity
for families wounded by misunderstanding and torn by division.
   The night persists, but the light of Christ is with mankind. It
is with the people in Europe; above the tumbled walls of
ideological and political opposition there appear for believers
demanding challenges and prospects.
   Yes, Europe's future will be filled with wonderful spiritual
vitality, if hedonism and practical materialism are overcome and
also if the barriers which divide the followers of the redeemer are
broken down.
   Unity in the Church, and among all believers in Christ: this is
the commitment of Christians for building the new Europe in the
third millennium.
   The light of Christ is with the tormented nations of the Middle
East. For the area of the (Persian) Gulf, we await with trepidation
for the threat of conflict to disappear. May leaders be convinced
that war is an adventure with no return.
   By reasoning, patience and dialogue with respect for the
inalienable rights of peoples and nations, it is possible to
identify and travel the paths of understanding and peace.
   The Holy Land too has been awaiting this peace for years: a
peaceful solution to the whole question which concerns it, a
solution which takes into account the legitimate expectations of
the Palestinian people and of the people which lives in the state
of Israel.
   May the light of Christ shine upon the continent of Africa,
especially where freedom is compromised because of under
development, where peace and harmony between different peoples and
traditions is disrupted by fratricidal struggles, where hope for
peace is still fragile and must be strengthened.
   I call once again for a more just sharing of the earth's
resources, a new and more just world ethical and economic order.
Only effective and respectful cooperation between the rich
countries and the emerging peoples can prevent the contrast between
north and south from becoming a widening abyss which will increase
the already vast and disturbing archipelago of poverty and death.
   But the shadows, through they seem to be growing deeper on the
horizon, cannot dim the light of Christ.
   To humanity seeking joy he offers the treasure of his own life:
he gives himself, lavishing the signs of his love upon our weary
present.
   How, for example, could we fail to bless him for the religious
awakening today influencing so many people, young and old? How
could we fail to thank him for the new openness of peoples to his
gospel, to which the recent ad limina visit of numerous bishops
from Vietnam also bears promising witness?
   Christ travels and lives with us. He is among us! Living and
glorious in his triumph of mercy.
   Let humanity go to meet his unapproachable light, which today
reveals itself to us with power.
   With the tongues of the peoples and nations let us ask for
light.

   Iraqi ambassadors headed home today for urgent consultations,
and U.S. troops in the Saudi desert experienced a Christmas of
contrast - peace and goodwill mixed with loneliness and a
heightened state of alert.
   At Camp David, President Bush was reportedly told that some
military leaders believe U.S. combat units in the Persian Gulf will
not be ready for all-out war with Iraq by the Jan. 15 deadline
imposed by the U.N. Security Council.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller, deputy U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia,
made a similar assessment last week during Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's visit.
   Saddam Hussein recalled his ambassadors from the United States,
the United Nations and several Western European countries.
   Iraqi officials were not saying what would be discussed, but the
call indicated Saddam could be planning a major diplomatic
offensive. The Council has said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait by
Jan. 15 or face possible attack by the almost 400,000-strong
U.S.-led multinational forces stationed in the gulf.
   Fear of terrorist attacks during the holiday season led U.S.
military commanders in the gulf to order extra security
precautions.
   Nevertheless, troops tried their best to bring a yuletide mood
to the Saudi sands. A special Christmas feast was prepared using
tons of supplies shipped in last month and Christmas carols were
sung inside tents.
   Santa even made several appearances - one courtesy of Coast
Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Ron Sauers, 44, of Rochester, N.Y.,
who used toilet paper for a beard and wore a red stocking cap.
   Services were held by Protestant and Roman Catholic chaplains,
renamed morale officers because of a Saudi law fobidding practice
of all religions expect Islam in the kingdom.
   Thousands of Christians celebrated Christmas in Baghdad today
and prayed for peace. Leaders of Iraq's 1.5 million Christians
officiated at midnight masses and morning services across the Iraqi
capital.
   Bush was reportedly told by Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Monday that military
commanders believe U.S. forces will not be ready for a full-scale
attack on Iraq by the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Cheney and Powell returned Monday from a five-day trip to the
gulf.
   The comments to Bush were reported by ABC-TV and The New York
Times. Both cited unnamed sources. The Times said Bush was told
many military officials recommend delaying any attack until
February.
   Neither the White House nor the Defense Department provided
details of the meeting.
   Waller's remarks appeared to have upset some officials in the
Bush administration, which has sought to show itself unwavering in
its determination to use force if Saddam refuses to quit Kuwait,
which he seized on Aug. 2.
   Cheney said on Sunday that U.S. troops would be ``prepared today
... to take military action,'' adding that U.S. troop strength in
the gulf is nearly 300,000.
   The Israeli media said today the Jewish state's military is on
higher alert than ever and has moved extra forces to its eastern
front, although army sources played down the reports.
   Banner headlines in most Israeli newspapers, and a report by
Israel radio's military correspondent, spoke of a heightened
military alert and reinforcements along the border with Jordan,
which lies between Israel and Iraq.
   The reports came the day after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said the danger of a gulf war was ``very close,'' and
Foreign Minister David Levy warned Jordan to ``not allow any
adventurer to use its land or air space for the purpose of
attacking Israel.''
   Saddam said over the weekend he would attack Tel Aviv first if
war broke out over Kuwait.
   But military sources said on condition of anoymity that a
military alert had been in force since the start of the gulf
crisis. They said they were not aware of any buildup on the Jordan
border.
   In other developments:
   -Comedian Bob Hope was in the gulf today entertaining troops.
Hope first visited U.S. troops for Christmas shows in 1941.
   -On Monday, about 500 mourners gathered at Mayport Naval Station
near Jacksonville, Fla., for ceremonies to honor the 21 sailors
from the USS Saratoga killed in a ferry boat accident off Israel.

included two children. They were not identified immediately.
   A visitor to the home, Todd Allen, 29, said he awakened to the

   The cause of the fire has not been determined.
   Firefighters searched the rubble for a possible sixth victim and

   The fire started on the first floor of the 2{-story house and
caused $30,000 damage, he said.
   One firefighter was slightly injured in a fall.

   The armed forces appeared in control
of this former Dutch colony today after toppling the nearly
3-year-old elected government in what two former Surinamese
officials called a bloodless coup.
   The Dutch government today condemned the military takeover
Monday night, and Dutch TV said no one was arrested in the coup.
   The takeover followed a dispute between President Ramsewak
Shankar and long-time military chief Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, who
had resigned earlier in the day.
   There were no reports of shooting and Shankar's whereabouts were
not known. Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Dig Istha said that
practically all communication lines out of Suriname were still cut
this afternoon.
   Dutch television quoted an Surinamese Embassy spokesman as
saying that no one has been put under arrest in the coup,
reportedly led by the acting commander of the Dutch forces, Ivan
Graanoogst.
   Observers in the Netherlands believed the coup was masterminded
by Bouterse.
   In 1980, Bouterse led a military coup that toppled a
legitimately elected government in the small mineral-rich country
on South America's northeastern tip. He ruled until elections in
November 1987, which Shankar's Front for Democracy and Development
party won by a landslide.
   Relations between the government and Bouterse have been strained
ever since Shankar began serving a five-year term on Jan. 25, 1988,
with Bouterse wielding considerable power by virtue of his control
of the military.
   In Amsterdam, Netherlands, a former high-ranking Surinamese
official who spoke with Bouterse after Monday's coup said the
military had acted after the government reneged on a pledge to step
down.
   Graanoogst announced the takeover on Surinamese television late
Monday, according to Dutch TV and former Surinamese diplomat living
in a nearby country.
   The former diplomat said the coup appeared to have been
bloodless and quoted Graanoogst as saying a curfew was in effect.
Graanoogst urged his countrymen to remain calm and said the
military had everything under control.
   The former Surinamese official in Amsterdam said the army had
promised to form an interim government that would organize free
elections within 100 days and that Bouterse had assured him that no
shots were fired during the coup.
   The official, Andre J. Haakmat, was minister of justice and
minister of the army from 1980-82 by went into exile after a
dispute with Bouterse.
   Earlier Monday night, a Surinamese newspaper reporter told The
Associated Press bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico that the military
had overthrown the government.
   The telephone line went dead after a few minutes and the
reporter, who did not want to be identified by name, was unable to
give further details.
   Later, all telephone and telex lines to Suriname went out of
service. In Washington, the State Department had no immediate
comment.
   In a dispute with Shankar, Bouterse announced Saturday that he
intended to resign as head of the military in this nation of
380,000 people.
   He was angered by treatment he had received at Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport and accused Shankar of collaborating with Dutch
officials who refused to grant him a visa or allow him access to
journalists.
   ``If I had been in Shankar's place I would have turned Schiphol
upside down to protect the dignity of the commander of my country's
national army,'' Bouterse said Saturday, returning from a trip via
Amsterdam to Ghana and Switzerland.
   Haakmat said the government had promised to step down in a
meeting Monday with Bouterse and other military leaders but reneged
immediately afterward.
   ``The government is being accused of failing to uphold
Surinamese national dignity,'' said Haakmat. ``In the two years
they were in power, they could not solve any of the problems in the
country.''
   The Dutch government said Bouterse was kept from the public at
the Amsterdam airport for security reasons, because Bouterse might
be at risk from the thousands of his political opponents who are
living in The Netherlands.
   The Dutch foreign ministry warned over the weekend that a ``coup
... will have a detrimental effect on development aid.''
   A $1.5-billion annual Dutch aid package to Suriname, which
gained independence in 1975, was suspended after 15 prominent
opposition leaders were killed on Dec. 8, 1982 by Bouterse's
military government.
   Bouterse had accused the leaders at the time of plotting to
overthrow him.
   But the suspension of the aid package only deepened the economic
crisis that beset the country after Bouterse took power, and the
weak economy has contributed to the political instability.
   Suriname has suffered from a drop in the price of bauxite, its
primary foreign exchange earner.
   Suriname is a multiracial nation whose population consists of
Indians, Javanese, Bush Negroes and indigenous tribes.
   Much of the country is covered by heavy jungle, making both
communications and internal security difficult.

   Stubborn cold in the West that dropped temperatures below those
in Alaska left songbirds lying frozen dead on the ground in
California, froze a cash register shut in New Mexico and threatened
flooding along ice-clogged rivers.
   It was one of the coldest Christmas Eves ever in Utah, where
records were knocked off the books by 15-degree margins. Record
subzero lows were recorded at 20 Utah sites and the mercury dropped
to 44 below in the Cache Valley.
   It was 32 below in Gallup, N.M. - so cold that the cash register
wouldn't open at Kristy's Coffee Shop unless cashiers thawed it
with a portable heater.
   ``It's colder here than it is where my parents are in Alaska.
And the last time I talked to my parents it was only 20 below,''
said Tracey Francis of the Sunwest Bank in Gallup.
   Meteorologist Allan Rowell in Albuquerque, N.M., said the
reading of 38 below zero at Dulce made the city the coldest in the
nation on Monday.
   In Alaska early today, it was 34 degrees in Anchorage and 8
degrees in Fairbanks. Boise, Idaho, was 16 below, and Albuquerque
was 5.
   Readings of 20 below zero or colder were reported Monday in
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.
   The number of deaths blamed on the weather since the record cold
snap began rose to at least 79 by Monday. Most were traffic deaths
blamed on slippery roads. Other people were killed by hypothermia,
tornadoes and house fires.
   In Santa Cruz, Calif., people reported songbirds lying frozen
dead on the ground after a record low of 19 - the coldest
temperature ever recorded in the seaside city about 80 miles south
of San Francisco.
   Temperatures were expected to rise slightly today through Friday
before another cold wave from the north prepared to sock the West.
   ``It will be a little bit warmer than the last blast, but it's
all relative,'' said meteorologist Jim Shadwick in Boise, Idaho.
His counterpart in Salt Lake City, William Alder, said it ``could
be a repeat performance.''
   Temperatures were expected to reach as high as the mid-60s today
in parts of California, but it was still cold this morning. San
Bernardino registered 32 degrees at 2 a.m., as did Oceanside. And
in the San Joaquin Valley, farmers who already have declared their
navel orange crop lost got a fourth straight freezing night, with
Fresno reporting 25 degrees at 2 a.m.
   No warming trend was in sight in the East, where a run of record
high temperatures ended abruptly Monday when the cold air arrived.
New York was at 24 early today, and Philadelphia was at 21,
readings some 40 degrees lower than the Monday's early morning
readings.
   Frozen water pipes continued to burst throughout the region, and
the cold weather caused a jump in house fires and made firefighting
more difficult.
   ``In the last seven days, there's been an inordinately large
number of fires,'' said Lt. Greg Keller, an investigator with the
fire department in Portland, Ore.
   The cold snap affected Christmas sales as temperatures in the
teens in Oregon burst more water pipes and created havoc.
   ``I look for the Saturday before Christmas to be my biggest day
of the year,'' said owner Rich Hansen of Gold &amp; Gems in Ashland,
Ore.
   A power outage cost him up to $10,000 in sales, he said. ``We
were absolutely devastated.''
   Only eight of the 79 rooms at the Bard's Inn Motel in Ashland
could be rented because broken pipes had caused major water damage,
said Teresa Loe, assistant manager.
   In Idaho and Washington state, huge ice floes clogged several
rivers and threatened to overflow their banks. Along the St. Joe
River, crews on Sunday failed to blast a channel through a 2-mile
ice jam near Calder, Idaho.
   ``We have a serious situation developing. We've got miles of
frozen river,'' said Harold Van Asche, disaster services
coordinator for Shoshone County. ``It's so massive there's not much
we can do.''

   Kevin Costner considered
filming ``Dances With Wolves'' in Grand Teton National Park but
switched to a South Dakota location when park officials wouldn't
let them use a choice site.
   ``The request was to provide a campsite of 40 tepees on a river
with the Tetons in the background,'' said Marshall Gingery, the
park's assistant superintendent.
   Park officials recommended a site along the Snake River north of
Moose, which was turned down by the filmmakers.
   They wanted to make Deadman's Bar, which sits along the Snake
River with the Tetons in the background, into a campsite. But park
officials didn't think it could withstand the heavy use it would
have received during the filmmaking.
   ``We felt the resource was not able to tolerate that
disturbance,'' Gingery said.
   Gingery also said officials were concerned about what off-road
traffic might do to the area. ``They were talking about boom
trucks. We didn't want any vehicles off the road - in the
cottonwoods, especially,'' he said.
   Gingery said the decision to move the film to South Dakota
probably was for the best because the terrain there is ``probably
more typical for the Sioux.''

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Gorbachev Plan for More Presidential Powers</HEAD>

Gorbachev plan for expanded presidential powers. Pickup 16th pvs,
`The amendments...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Parliament today voted to give sweeping new powers
to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, approving his ideas for a new
vice presidency and Cabinet under his direct control.
   The approval of new powers by the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies was a clear victory for Gorbachev, and a triumph
for the hard-line lawmakers whom Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze cited last week in his stunning resignation. He said
hard-liners were pushing the country to ``dictatorship.''
   The parliament voted today to eliminate Gorbachev's moribund
Presidential Council, form a new Federation Council with Gorbachev
as its chief, and create a powerful new vice presidency subordinate
to Gorbachev.
   They approved a bill placing the proposed new Cabinet of
Ministers under Gorbachev's direct control, as opposed to the
current Council of Ministers's subordination to the national
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   The parliament also fell short of the two-thirds majority needed
to approve a bill that would require legislative approval for
Gorbachev's presidential decrees. The president currently can issue
his sweeping orders without any oversight, although many republics
have been ignoring the decrees and adding to the breakdown of
order.
   The votes came after Boris N. Yeltsin, leader of the Soviet
Union's most populous republic, condemned the plans to broaden
Gorbachev's power and said he would vote against them.
   The Soviet president claims the reforms are needed to hold
together a country being threatened with collapse by separatists
movements and economic chaos. Each of the republics have declared
some form of political independence or economic autonomy, seeking
to supercede national laws with their own.
   The Gorbachev-proposed amendments would replace the Council of
Ministers and its prime minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, with a smaller
15-member Cabinet and a more powerful vice president, all under
direct presidential control.
   They also would give more power to Gorbachev's Federation
Council of representatives from the 15 republics.
   Debate began today with one deputy suggesting Gorbachev should
give up some of his posts in the reorganization.
   ``Don't you feel sorry for Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev? He has
only one life to live,'' Erkin Yusupov, a deputy from Uzbekistan,
told the Congress.
   ``He has a family, children, grandchildren. He is (Communist
Party) general secretary. He is president. He is responsible for
the Council of Ministers. In the end, we have to consider ... how
much is one person capable of doing.''
   Gorbachev, who has attended every session since the Congress
opened Dec. 17, said he would keep the jobs in the government and
party.
   The president also indicated Shevardnadze had agreed to remain
foreign minister during the congress, scheduled to end Thursday.
   ``Shevardnadze, I believe, is a man who has done a lot and will
still do a lot,'' Gorbachev told reporters today. ``The question of
where and how will continue'' to be discussed.
   The amendments on presidential power include provisions that
would prohibit the vice president from being a member of Congress,
said Alexander Kudryavtsev, chairman of the amendment drafting
commission.
   Nearly every senior leader, including the few people thought to
be candidates for the vice presidency, is a deputy in the Congress.
   Kudryavtsev also said the draft calls for the Federation Council
to include representatives of the 15 republics and the 20 smaller
``autonomous republics,'' which are under republic jurisdiction.
That would give the Council about 150 members, which Kudryavtsev
likened to a small ``general assembly.''
   On Monday, Congress ordered each republic to hold a referendum
asking residents whether they want to remain in a restructured
Soviet Union, and another on whether people should be allowed to
own land privately.
   Private property ownership already has been approved by the
Russian legislature, which has authority over three-quarters of the
country's land and control of 90 percent of its energy supplies.
   Yeltsin has said there is no need for a referendum.
   Congress also endorsed the concept of a new Union Treaty to keep
the union together and voted to keep ``socialist'' as part of the
country's name.

   A strong earthquake shook northeastern
Taiwan on Tuesday night but there were no immediate reports of
casualties or damage, authorities said.
   The Central Weather Bureau said the quake registered 6.2 on the
Richter scale. The epicenter was 7{ miles south of the eastern city
of Hualien, 108 miles southeast of Taipei.
   Weather forecasters said seven minor temblors shook the Hualien
area on Tuesday, and they also were felt in Taipei, the capital.
   Police said there were no immediate reports of injuries or
damage.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a 10-fold increase
in intensity.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area, while one measuring 7 is classified as a major
earthquake, capable of causing widespread, heavy damage.

   Here are some facts and figures on
Suriname:
   ---
   THE LAND - About the size of Georgia, the 63,037-square-mile
tropical nation is on the northeastern slope of South America
between Guyana on the west and French Guiana on the east. Its
100-mile southern border adjoins Brazil in the depths of the Amazon
rain forest. Half the country's nearly 400,000 people live in the
Atlantic coast capital of Paramaribo.
   ---
   THE PEOPLE - One of world's most ethnically diverse countries,
the former Dutch colony's population is made up mainly of East
Indians, Creoles - descendants of African slaves - and Indonesians.
They live mostly along the Atlantic coast. The jungle interior is
sparsely inhabited by Maroons, who make up 10 percent of the
population. They are descendants of runaway African slaves and
indigenous Indians. The races are often divided along political
lines. Religions include Hindu, Moslem, Roman Catholic, Moravian,
Jewish and several Protestant denominations. The official language
is Dutch, but the most commonly spoken language is lingua franca
Sranang Tongo, or Taki-Taki. Many also speak English.
   ---
   HISTORY - First sighted by Columbus in 1498. English begin
settling in 1651, starting cocoa, coffee, sugar and cotton
plantations. The Netherlands acquires territory from Britain
through Treaty of Breda in 1667, which cedes New Amsterdam, now New
York, to England. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Suriname passes
hands to England, France and back to the Netherlands in 1815.
Becomes independent on Nov. 25, 1975, as a parliamentary democracy.
Coup of Feb. 25, 1980, results from labor dispute between the army
and government. Sgt. Maj. Desi Bouterse emerges as the leader,
dissolves parliament and rules by decree. On Dec. 8, 1982, army
arrests 15 opposition leaders, executes them while in detention.
The Netherlands and United States cut economic aid. In October
1987, Bouterse allows elections, opposition parties win by
landslide, form three-party coalition and appoint Ramsewak Shankar
as president. Bouterse returns Saturday from the Netherlands, calls
Shankar a ``joker'' he can no longer serve, announces resignation.
Civilian government overthrown Monday.
   ---
   ECONOMY - Before 1980 coup, Suriname was one of most prosperous
countries in South America, with per capita gross national product
of $3,500. By 1985 per capita GNP drops to $2,500. Up to 10 percent
of the populace emigrates to the Netherlands, French Guiana and
other countries. Four factors contribute to economic decline after
1980 coup: Army sergeants unprepared for leadership, drop in world
bauxite prices, the Netherlands cuts $1.5 billion aid package after
December 1982 massacre of civic leaders, Jungle Command guerrilla
warfare curtails activity in bauxite-producing eastern part of
country. Suriname has some of world's richest deposits of bauxite,
raw material of aluminum. Bauxite is the major foreign exchange
earner. Other exports are shrimp, timber, bananas, palm oil and
vegetables. Foreign reserves depleted by 1984. Jungle Command, led
by former soldier Ronny Brunswijk, a Maroon, closes bauxite mines
and aluminum shelters in 1986. After elections, Brunswijk reaches
peace accord with new government. Army opposes terms of agreement
and fighting resumes. The Netherlands agrees to resume aid after
election, but scraps the plan after Surinamese coup.

   A government commission on Tuesday
asked citizens to volunteer information on alleged corruption by
deposed President Hussain Muhammad Ershad and his senior officials.
   The three-member investigative commission began work Monday to
gather evidence and recommend legal action, said a statement
published in Tuesday's newspapers.
   The statement asked people to submit any information on misdeeds
by the former government through the mail or in person. The
commission is headed by Supreme Court Justice Delwar Muhammad
Ansaruddin Ahmed.
   Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a bloodless
coup in 1982, was placed under house arrest on Dec. 12, six days
after he relinquished power.
   Ershad's ouster and replacement by a caretaker government
followed nearly two months of anti-government protests. His
administration was widely suspected of corruption and abusing
power.
   Police so far have arrested Ershad, his wife, Raushan, and three
former Cabinet ministers. They also detained Zeenat Musharaf, who
has been linked romantically with Ershad and who allegedly
benefited from business favors, and her husband, Musharaf Hussain,
a leading businessman.
   Arrest warrants have been issued for another 11 top officials of
Ershad's ousted government.
   The student protesters have demanded an immediate trial. They
have criticized the caretaker administration for failing to arrest
Ershad's close advisers, who are accused of making millions of
dollars through corrupt practices.

   Madza Motor Corp. of Japan will recall 3,498 Luce
model passenger cars because of switch defects in their stop lights
and cruise control mechanisms, the automaker said Tuesday.
   A Transport Ministry official, meanwhile, said the government
told Mazda to pay more attention to the safety of its cars.
   Of the cars to be recalled, 134 were exported to Middle Eastern
countries, said Mazda spokesman Kingo Okitsu. The others were sold
in Japan.
   Okitsu said Mazda had notified the Transport Ministry of the
recall.
   Because of the defective switches, stop lights may not work even
if the driver hits the brakes, and the cruise control may not turn
off, Okitsu said.
   The government's warning came after the Transport Ministry
investigated allegations that Mazda had been replacing defective
parts during routine maintenance without recalling the cars or
notifying the government, said the ministry official, who spoke on
condition of annymity.
   Okitsu said the recalled cars were produced between Aug. 8,
1986, and Jan. 31, 1987.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported on Dec. 16
that Mazda was quietly fixing defects that should have led to a
recall.

<HEAD>Poll: Europeans Believe Japan Shirking Global Responsibilities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of people surveyed in major European
countries have a favorable view of Japan but believe it is not
fulfilling its international responsibilities, the Foreign Ministry
reported Tuesday.
   Among the chief criticisms was that Japan needs to correct its
trade imbalance. However, many respondents said the creation of the
European single market planned for 1992 will improve relations
between Japan and the European Community, the ministry said in a
news release.
   It was the sixth such poll conducted by Japan since 1977. It was
carried out from September through October by private research
organizations in each of the countries surveyed: Britain, France,
Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
   In all seven countries, ``the degree of trust in Japan is rather
high,'' ranging from 71 percent to 91 percent, the ministry said.
   In every country except Italy, however, a majority of
respondents thought Japan was not fulfilling its international
role.
   Japan, the world's No. 2 economic power, has come under
criticism for not doing more to assist U.S.-led forces in the
Persian Gulf and to ease its chronic trade surpluses.
   Many respondents called for a prompt correction of Japan's trade
surplus with the EC, which totaled $1.49 billion in November. The
most commonly cited recommendation was for Japan to open its
markets more and expand domestic demand.
   Among other findings, according to a summary released by the
ministry:
   -Expectations for direct investment from Japan were high in
every country.
   -Business development by Japanese companies in Eastern Europe
was ``generally desired.'' But most respondents said Japanese
companies should invest only in cooperation with Western European
countries. In Germany, however, 71 percent said the Japanese should
get involved on their own.
   The survey, sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was conducted by
mail in Britain, western Germany and Belgium with responses from
1,543 out of 6,550 people to whom questionnaires were mailed.
   In the other countries, interviews were conducted with a total
of 1,936 people.
   The poll did not give a margin of error. Japanese pollsters do
not calculate such margins, claiming they might mislead readers
into thinking a poll is more accurate than it really is.

<TEXT>
   Officials in the central province of Shaanxi have
formed a special anti-drug force to combat narcotics trafficking
and abuse, the Legal Daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The state newspaper said 184 people were convicted of
drug-related crimes in Shaanxi in the first 10 months of this year.
It gave no details.
   Shaanxi officials said the illegal trade and drug abuse have
increased dramatically over the past three years. Authorities in
other regions of China also have expressed alarm over the country's
increasing drug problems.
   Chinese courts in Shaanxi and other provinces have begun to
impose stiff sentences for drug crimes - in some cases even the
death penalty.
   The Legal Daily said authorities broke up three smuggling
networks bringing drugs into Shaanxi from other provinces such as
Yunnan this year.
   Yunnan, in southwestern China, borders the ``Golden Triangle,''
an area including parts of Thailand, Laos and Burma that has been
one of the largest sources of opium for the world's heroin supply.
   Yunnan also has been a gateway for smugglers carrying drugs
through southwestern China to Hong Kong for shipment abroad.
   The Legal Daily said authorities from Shaanxi and the
neighboring province of Henan worked together to crush two regional
drug-trafficking networks involving more than 20 people.
   It said that in addition to the legal crackdown, the special
team set up in Shaanxi will increase efforts to curb drug use.
Addicts will receive treatment to help break their drug habits and
education programs have been started to prevent others from using
illegal narcotics, the newspaper said.
   China's drug problem was virtually eliminated after the
Communists came to power in 1949, but it has re-emerged in recent
years.

<TEXT>
   A leader of a militant Moslem group in
Kashmir state rejected Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's offer
Tuesday to negotiate with the rebels, who want to secede from
India.
   But in Punjab, where Sikh militants also are fighting for
secession, a prominant political leader said he was prepared to
talk to the government - if he received a formal invitation,
including a written agenda.
   A day earlier, in the far eastern state of Assam, the army
captured a top leader of the United Liberation Front of Assam and
25 other group members in a month-old offensive to crush the
separatist movement, a newspaper reported.
   India has suspended local government in all three states and
placed them under federal rule in an effort to control guerrilla
operations and terrorism, which have left thousands of people dead
this year.
   The violence and religious conflict helped topple the government
of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh last month.
   Chandra Shekhar has repeatedly offered to negotiate with any
rebel group on condition talks cover issues that fall within the
constitution. The wording of the offer, however, rules out talks on
breaking away from India.
   On Tuesday, authorities freed Abdul Ahad Gurd, a leading
advocate of Kashmiri independence, on a monthlong parole. He was
arrested in Septermber. United News of India described Gurd's
release as a move toward opening a dialogue with Kashmiri
militants.
   But Ghulam Qadir Wani, spokesman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation
Front, dismissed Chandra Shekhar's offer to talk, in an interview
published Tuesday in the Hindustan Times, an independent
English-language daily. The Liberation Front is the largest of many
separatist factions in the northern Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Wani was quoted as accusing Indian security forces of the
``massacre of Kashmiri youth and the rape of young women.''
   ``Should we bind ourselves to the terms and conditions of such a
constitution and sit across the negotiating table?'' the paper
quoted him as asking.
   Most militants seek independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only
state with a Moslem majority in Hindu-dominated India. Some groups
want to unite with Moslem Pakistan, but others have called for a
plebiscite to choose their future.
   Wani, speaking from a hideout, was quoted as saying Kashmiris
``have become conscious of their rights ... and now they are ready
to make any sacrifice for this cause.''
   In Punjab, Simranjit Singh Mann said he was prepared to talk
about self-determination for the wealthy farming state, where Sikhs
have a bare majority. Overall, Sikhs are only 2 percent of India's
880 million people.
   Mann was elected to Parliament in 1989 at the head of the
largest Sikh faction, but resigned his seat last year. He is known
to be close to some guerrilla factions but is opposed by others as
too moderate.
   Extremists have killed more than 3,200 people this year in
Punjab, in the most violent12 months since Sikhs launched their
independence campaign in 1983.
   Another 1,700 people have died in Kashmir since the government
began a crackdown on the separatist movement a year ago.
   India has accused Pakistan of supporting the guerrillas in the
two border states with training and weapons. Islamabad says it
provides only moral and political support to the secessionists.
   Press Trust of India reported that army troops arrested a senior
leader of the United Liberation Front of Assam, in what was called
a major breakthrough in the government's search-and-destroy mission
against the Front.
   So far, about 1,000 suspected Front guerrillas have been
captured since the offensive was launched on Nov. 28, but most
leaders have escaped, reportedly across the border to Burma.
   The Front has been fighting a separatist campaign since 1988,
claiming the state was being stripped of its revenues from its rich
tea plantations and oil fields.
   At least two tea companies had closed their operations because
of kidnappings and extortion before the government imposed federal
rule and sent in the army.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T: We Made A Mistake When `Free' Callers From Gulf Were Billed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 25,000 families and friends of
people serving in the Persian Gulf were mistakenly billed for calls
that were supposed to be free, and the charges will be canceled,
AT&amp;T officials said Tuesday.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. had offered to let servicemen
and women in the Gulf to make the free calls during Thanksgiving
week, of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27, and 140,000 calls were made.
   But some local phone companies did not follow through on
instructions not to bill the troops' families for these calls,
company spokesman Richard Wallersteinsaid. The calls were placed
to families all over the United States.
   Wallerstein said no one will have to pay for the bills, no
matter how high they were. He said he had heard some of the bills
had reached $500, but had no definitive information.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that bills sent to some
soldiers' families soared as high as $2,000.
   The offer was for one three-minute call per soldier, but
Wallerstein said AT&amp;T had no way to enforce the limit.
   AT&amp;T first offered free calls home for a week in mid-October,
then renewed the offer for Thanksgiving. A total of about 275,000
calls were made.
   Each offer cost the company more than $1 million, Wallerstein
said.
   Meanwhile, AT&amp;T announced Monday a free call-home campaign for
U.S. Navy sailors and Marines stationed on ships in the Middle
East.
   The offer is good through New Year's Eve, and Wallerstein said
he didn't expect any problems.
   ``We'll just do the bills right this time,'' he said.

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II prayed for peace on
Christmas Day as world leaders spoke worriedly of the prospect of
war in the Persian Gulf. U.S. soldiers' thoughts turned to loved
ones as they spent a somber holiday far from home.
   Germans marked their first Christmas since their national
unification, and Albanians were free to celebrate a religious
holiday for the first time in more than two decades.
   In Bethlehem, the site of Jesus' birth, soldiers patrolled the
city. Crowds were small and the atmosphere subdued because of the
gulf crisis and the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising, which has
sharply cut tourism to the Holy Land.
   ``The light of Christ is with the tormented nations of the
Middle East,'' the pontiff said in a Christmas message delivered
from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in rain-soaked
Vatican City.
   ``For the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for the
threat of conflict to disappear,'' the pope said. ``May leaders be
convinced that war is an adventure with no return.''
   John Paul said a peaceful solution in Israeli-occupied lands
must take ``into account the legitimate expectations of the
Palestinian people.''
   The fear of Palestinian unrest and the gulf crisis left
Bethlehem with one of its smallest Christmas crowds in recent
memory.
   ``For us, Christmas is an event of peace, and here you cannot
feel peace,''said German tourist Gabriele Beitz in Manger Square,
near the grotto where tradition holds that Christ was born.
   In Albania, where a 23-year-old ban on religion was lifted in
November, Roman Catholic priest Simon Jubani led Christmas Mass in
a rundown chapel in the northern city of Shkodra.
   The Croatian news agency HINA reported that more than 30,000
Catholics attended the Mass, which would make it the biggest such
celebration in postwar Albania. Security forces were on hand, but
no incidents were reported, the news agency said.
   It said another 500 worshipers attended a Mass in Tirana,
Albania's capital.
   ``For the first time in 23 years, there will be midnight Mass,''
said Jubani, who was jailed eight times by the former Stalinist
regime. ``Merry Christmas.''
   In his message, John Paul said the fall of communist rule in
Eastern Europe last year poses ``demanding challenges'' for
Catholics in the region.
   ``Europe's future will be filled with wonderful spiritual
vitality if hedonism and practical materialism are overcome,'' he
said.
   In and around the Persian Gulf, tens of thousands of American
troops were on a heightened state of alert to guard against any
attacks. But soldiers still celebrated the holiday with carols,
decorations and religious services.
   Christmas festivities in Saudi Arabia, where the bulk of the
U.S. troops are deployed, were muted to avoid offending the Islamic
Saudis. Carols such as ``Silent Night'' were sung behind closed
tent flaps, and military chaplains held low-key services.
   Servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga were still
mourning the loss of 21 crewmen in the sinking of an Israeli ferry
on Saturday. The ferry capsized as it was bringing the men back to
the Saratoga after shore leave in Israel.
   Crewmen ferried to Haifa, Israel, to telephone home on
Christmas, but said they had little inclination to celebrate.
   ``Any plans I had of having me a good time died with the guys on
Saturday,'' said a sailor from Louisiana, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``I'm going to go straight back to the ship and have a
quiet Christmas after I phone home.''
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II thanked the multinational forces
in the gulf for ``resisting the bully and the tyrant.'' She also
condemned attacks by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland,
where 75 people have died in violence so far this year.
   The archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, said war in the
Persian Gulf could only be justified ``if and when all other means
of persuasion have failed.''
   ``In such a combat thousands could suffer and die,'' said
Runcie, who was a decorated tank officer in World War II.
   Germans marked Christmas as one nation with a gesture of
friendship to the Soviet Union. Money was collected to help ease
Soviet food shortages and some people in former East Germany
invited Red Army soldiers over for the holiday.
   In China, an officially atheist country, worshipers and the
curious joined in prayer and song in state-controlled churches.
   ``I am not a believer,'' said one student who attended a service
in Beijing, ``but I know this day is very important to some people
here and people everywhere. I just want to learn a little about
it.''
   In his message, the pope also spoke of Africa, ``disrupted by
fratricidal struggles, where hope for peace is still fragile and
must be strengthened.''
   However, the pontiff said the light of Christmas broke through
the ``shadows'' of some world conflicts. He pointed to communist
Vietnam's granting permission to bishops to travel to Rome to meet
with him.
   The Vatican said the pope's message was broadcast in about 60
countries, including Poland, Bulagria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania and the Soviet Union, which have all established formal
ties with the Vatican since 1989.

   President Bush spent a secluded Christmas with
his family Tuesday - a holiday overshadowed by the possibility that
soon he may have to order American troops to war.
   Bush and his wife Barbara were at Camp David in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains, about 60 miles north of Washington, with their
children and grandchildren, spokesman Steve Hart said.
   The holiday menu included turkey, cranberry sauce, green beans,
sweet potatoes, and pie, Hart said. Bush was not expecting visitors
and planned no special activities for the day, he said.
   But although his stay at Camp David through Jan. 2 is billed as
a vacation, the president will work several hours every day and
receive reports on developments around the world, Hart said.
   Bush decided to forgo his traditional Texas turkey hunt this
year so he could stay close to Washington and monitor the Persian
Gulf crisis, aides said.
   In his Christmas message to U.S. troops, Bush promised he would
try to bring them home ``without a single shot fired.'' But if they
must fight, he added, ``the sacrifices you make will never be
forgotten.''
   On Christmas Eve Bush conferred at Camp David with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both had just returned from five days in
Saudi Arabia.
   The two reportedly told Bush that senior military officers think
the U.S. troops deployed in the Saudi desert will not be ready to
attack Iraqi forces by Jan. 15 - the deadline set by the United
Nations for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   That opinion was first expressed several days ago by Lt. Gen.
Calvin Waller, deputy U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia. Cheney and
Powell told Bush that commanders in the field predict U.S. troops
won't be ready until the beginning or middle of February, The New
York Times reported Tuesday.
   Hart had no comment on the report.
   The U.N. Security Council decided last month that the United
States and its allies would be allowed to use force against Iraq
unless its troops left Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Bush said he wanted to give diplomacy one final chance by
sending Secretary of State James Baker to Baghdad to convey
American determination to implement the U.N. resolution.
   But attempts to arrange a meeting between Baker and Saddam have
failed. And Baker, who said he would be willing to fly to Baghdad
on Christmas day, was instead spending the holiday in Houston, his
hometown.
   Cheney was spending Christmas in Wyoming and Vice President Dan
Quayle was skiing in Vail, Colo. Quayle plans to visit American
troops in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 29.

<TEXT>
   A weeklong ban on ammunition sales that began
Tuesday should make it harder to start 1991 with a bang, say
authorities concerned about revelers shooting into the air New
Year's Eve.
   The ban, in effect in San Fernando as well as Los Angeles,
angers gun shop owners, who predict it will be ineffective.
   Barry Kahn, general manager of B&amp;B Sales in North Hollywood,
said customers will only have to visit a neighboring community to
buy ammunition.
   ``Frankly, it's a crock,'' he said. ``They can't come up with
the statistics to back the law.''
   No one was injured last year by falling bullets, but in previous
years bystanders have been wounded or even killed.
   ``We don't expect to solve it overnight, even with the ban,''
said police Deputy Chief William Rathburn. ``But we're optimistic
that over the years we can stop the practice of celebrating New
Year's Eve by firing guns.''

   Serbia's renamed Communists
overwhelmingly won the republic's first free vote in five decades,
taking 194 seats in the republic's 250-seat parliament, according
to final official results Tuesday.
   Serbia, the largest republic, and Montenegro, the smallest, were
the only two of Yugoslavia's six republics to elect Commnunist
governments. In the other four regions, center-right or nationalist
parties triumphed.
   The results in Serbia and Montenegro threaten to push Yugoslavia
one step closer to disintegration.
   The pro-capitalist opposition in Serbia did better in Sunday's
second-round voting than in the first round Dec. 9. But it failed
to dislodge the former Communists - recently renamed the Socialists
- from control of the state assembly.
   In the first round, the Socialists won 87 seats and their
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, was re-elected by a wide margin as the
republic's president.
   The opposition, which formed a coalition on the eve of the
second round ballot, won 48 seats in the one-chamber parliament.
Eight seats went to independent candidates not involved in the
coalition.
   Some prominent Communists and close allies of Milosevic,
including Serbian Premier Stanko Radmilovic, were ousted in the
second round.
   Dragoljub Micunovic of the Democratic Party, who defeated a
Socialist candidate in Belgrade, told reporters the opposition
should look into alleged irregularities before declaring the
elections fair and honest.
   He also complained the opposition did not get enough coverage by
Socialist-controlled media to present an effective campaign.
   In Slovenia, where a center-right coalition ousted Communists in
spring elections, 95 percent of voters in a referendum Sunday chose
independence from Yugoslavia.
   Slovenia's parliament will decide within the next six months
whether to secede from the fractious federation. Both Slovenia and
its Western-minded ally Croatia say they will secede if Yugoslavia
is not transformed into a loose confederation.
   Serbia, home to 40 percent of Yugoslavia's 23.5 million
inhabitants, advocates a strong federal government. Milosevic has
not been willing to negotiate with the western republics and warned
he will not respect borders within Yugoslavia if the federation
breaks up.
   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, this month
threatened army intervention to preserve federal integrity.
   A recent CIA report predicted the country could fall apart
within 18 months because of ethnic tensions and political
infighting among republics. It said civil war was possible.

   Did you hear the one about the guy who
thought he accepted a job in Iowa, only to find out Boise is in
Idaho?
   Or the one about a Wall Street Journal real estate ad listing a
$450,000 log cabin in Sun Valley, Iowa? The renowned ski resort is
in Idaho.
   For a decade, Tim Woodward, a columnist for The Idaho Statesman,
has written periodically about the confusion over two states 1,500
miles apart.
   Woodward says he keeps writing what he intends to be the last
column on the subject, only to be deluged with newspaper clippings,
magazine articles and testimonials from readers with more tales of
what he calls the ``Idaho-Iowa connection.''
   ``I have a file - it probably weighs about five pounds - of
stuff that I still have to use,'' Woodward said. ``There isn't a
week that goes by that I don't get things from people.''
   Woodward, a 42-year-old Boise native who is writing a book on
such mixups, believes much of the confusion comes what he calls
``the `I' factor.''
   ``People think all four of the `I' states should be in a neat
line in the Midwest,'' he said. Of course, three of them are: Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana.
   The confusion between Iowa and Idaho certainly can't be
attributed to a similarity of landscape.
   Idaho has a dozen national forests and its highest point is
12,662 feet; Iowa has no national forests and its highest point is
1,670 feet.
   ``We both have corn fields, but Iowa has a lot more,'' Woodward
said.
   Woodward said one of his favorite mix-ups is the pilot who
thought he was moving to Iowa.
   ``Someone told him the Boise assignment was a good one - that itwas
good working hours, easy flying conditions, not much air
traffic,'' Woodward said.
   ``Not until he actually got ready to move and had been given the
Boise assignment did he realize he was 1,500 miles off,'' Woodward
said. ``He had Boise and Des Moines mixed up.''
   ``But he came anyway, he liked it, and he's still here.''

   When electric rates go up or the wind
knocks power lines down, Norman Pearson and Julieanne Belanger
never notice.
   Pearson and Belanger choose to live without any help from the
electric company. They heat their home with wood and cook with
propane or on a wood stove, depending on the season.
   Until last spring, when Pearson installed solar panels on his
roof that provide some electricity, the only indoor lighting was
from gas lamps, kerosene lanterns and flashlights.
   The couple do without indoor plumbing and use an outhouse 20
yards from their home.
   Pearson, who grew up in a middle-class home in a Chicago suburb,
says he enjoys the feeling of self-sufficiency.
   His decision to go without electricity also reflects his
opposition to nuclear power and concern that extending power lines
to his house might encourage people to build on undeveloped
property nearby.
   ``I've seen power bills,'' said Pearson. ``I'm amazed at how
much they are.''
   ``It's a secure thing,'' said Belanger, who built a tiny house
of her own in nearby Concord with no water or electricity in the
1970s. ``Our neighbors sometimes would call after a storm and say,
`Did you lose your electricity?' They'd forget.''
   Pearson and Belanger are not the only people in Maine who live
without electricity. There are houses scattered around the state
without power, although there are no statistics on how many.
   The couple's house looks as if it were built in sections as
needed. There are no visible wires leading to the house; the phone
line is underground.
   Inside, the house is heated by a wood stove and the sun that
shines through fiberglass covers on the southern side. Pearson cuts
the wood on his land, primarily from damaged trees, to feed the
stove.
   More than seven cords of wood - enough to last more than a year
- are stacked in a shed.
   ``It's a great feeling to have excess wood,'' Pearson said.
   The couple cook on a big cast-iron wood-burning stove. During
the summer they use a small stove hooked up to a propane gas tank.
Their tiny refrigerator is powered by propane in the summer and is
not used in the winter.
   The only water inside comes through a hand pump in the kitchen
sink hooked up to a well. There's no toilet, no shower, no hot
water except for the pot on top of the stove.
   Pearson said he could build a bathroom, but prefers the
outhouse. Toilets waste too much clean water, he says.
   Pearson grew up with the typical amenities and graduated from
Northwestern University. He was a Maine social worker for seven
years and now works six to eight weeks a year as a substitute rural
mail carrier. He is also a New Vineyard selectman.
   Belanger teaches first grade in New Portland, 10 miles away. Her
daughter, Ahmen, is an eighth-grader at Mount Blue Junior High
School in Farmington.
   Ahmen would prefer to live in a normal house with electricity
and water. She said she would love to have a shower in the
mornings, and isn't fond of having to walk to the outhouse,
especially on cold winter nights.
   Many of her friends think the house is novel, but others refuse
to visit overnight because there's no bathroom.
   Pearson said his lifestyle has surprised foreign friends who
have visited the house over the years.
   ``They were amazed,'' Pearson said. ``They always thought
America is the land of consumption, the land of plenty.''

   Singer Lou Rawls says his graduation from the
College of Hard Knocks has made him determined that young black
Americans will not be denied a higher education because they can't
afford one.
   He is heading his 11th annual Parade of Stars Telethon for the
United Negro College Fund on Saturday.
   The telethon has raised more than $77 million for 41 private,
predominantly black colleges and universities.
   Rawls, a four-time Grammy Award-winner, occasionally runs across
young people his telethon has aided.
   ``This young pharmacist kept staring at me,'' Rawls recounted
recently. ``Finally, I asked her if something was wrong. She said,
`I never thought I'd get a chance to thank you.' She told me she'd
received her education with the help of the telethon.
   ``You can't put a price tag on experiences like that.''
   Rawls, who grew up poor on Chicago's South Side, criticizes
federal education policies, which have restricted minority-only
scholarships.
   ``They play with education like it's a ball game,'' he said.
``How can they be so casual and so nonchalant about our education
and our welfare?''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - The canceled TV series ``Baywatch,'' the
lifeguard drama starring David Hasselhoff that drowned in low
ratings, is riding a new wave of popularity overseas and will
resume production next year, its syndicator said.
   ``Baywatch'' was canceled by NBC last spring after ending its
first season ranked 74th among 111 series the three major networks.
   But the show proved a hit overseas, becoming the No. 1 imported
show in the United Kingdom, said Henry Siegel, president of LBS
Communications, which syndicates the show. The show has been sold
in more than 40 nations.
   ``In the U.K., their rationale is that `Baywatch' may be what
people perceive that the U.S. is all about. It has good-looking
people with good action,'' said Siegel.
   The strong foreign sales make new episodes possible.
Additionally, Hasselhoff has agreed to take a lower-than-usual
salary in exchange for a share of the profits, Siegel said.
   Critics said the show lacked substance and had too many scantily
clad beach romps - sort of a ``Babes Watch.'' But Siegel cited poor
promotion as the reason ``Baywatch'' failed.
   Far from being a sexploitation show, he said, it's ```Emergency'
on the beach. It's also an issue-oriented show, but the issues
happen on the beach.''
   Siegel expects the former cast to return, with the exception of
Parker Stevenson and Shawn Weatherly.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Wayne Newton will headline Gov.-elect
Pete Wilson's inaugural party next month.
   The Las Vegas entertainer was invited by his friend and high
school classmate, Gayle Wilson, the wife of the Republican senator
who will be sworn in Jan. 7 as California's 36th governor.
   The party Jan. 6 at the Arco Arena in Sacramento will feature a

   All three were active Wilson supporters during his campaign,
Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur said.
   Also performing will be opera singer Julia Migenes, the Kingston
Trio and comedians Fred Travalena and Gallagher.
   The gala, with tickets starting at $100, is privately funded.
   At Gov. George Deukmejian's gala celebrating his 1982 election,
MGM produced a two-hour stage show that featured Dean Martin, Peggy

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Exiled former first lady Imelda
Marcos said Tuesday that if the Philippine government allows her to
come home, every day will be Christmas.
   ``I do hope that one day I will be allowed by the government of
the Republic of the Philippines to give and love my countrymen
freely,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a holiday message sent to news
organizations here.
   ``You can be sure that with your former first lady, former
Mother of the Country, when I come home, Christmas will not be for
a day,'' she added. ``I will make it Christmas every day and make
every day a day of giving and a day of love.''
   The government refused to allow the late President Ferdinand
Marcos and his family to return from Hawaii, where they fled when
he was ousted in a popular uprising in 1986. Marcos died in
September 1989.
   His successor, President Corazon Aquino, has said the sufferings
of the Filipino people were caused in large part because Marcos and
his associates looted the treasury of billions of dollars during
his 20-year rule.

   By this point on the political calendar,
New Hampshire's campaign veterans are accustomed to seeing would-be
presidential nominees at work in the first primary state, in person
or by proxy.
   But a year before first primary of the next presidential
election campaign, nothing is stirring.
   A few potential candidates visited in 1989 and early 1990, but
not one candidate or campaign worker has set up shop in what should
be prime time to prepare for 1992.
   ``It's been amazingly quiet,'' says Dennis Murphy, chairman of
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's 1988 primary campaign. ``I haven't heard
from anyone, haven't talked to anyone even remotely representing a
presidential candidate.''
   By contrast, Democrats Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona
governor, and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader
from Missouri, campaigned in New Hampshire two years before the
1988 primary. Other candidates, including then-Vice President
George Bush, had campaign workers in the state at this time in
1986.
   Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the eventual
nominees, won their party primaries here in 1988. Since the current
primary system was instituted, no president has been elected
without winning in New Hampshire first.
   In Iowa, site of the first presidential caucus, the political
scene is equally quiet.
   What's the story?
   Some say candidates have abandoned long primary campaigns
because they are too grueling, can lead to burnout, and have turned
off many voters. They also point to Gephardt, who withdrew before
the national convention in 1988, as evidence that candidates who
get the jump on their competition often end up losing anyway.
   Others say candidates don't want to tip their hands too early.
   ``After even one trip here, no one can say anything on their
minds anymore because it will be viewed as being motivated by
presidential politics,'' says Ned Helms, the state Democratic
chairman.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia recently turned down an invitation to
speak in New Hampshire in February.
   ``I am not ready to have everyone in the country say that Sam
Nunn has decided to run for president,'' he explained.
   The 1988 primary was for an open presidential race, with Ronald
Reagan retiring. Bush will be up for re-election in 1992.
   State Republican Chairwoman Rhona Charbonneau said Gov. Mario
Cuomo's narrowed margin in a three-way New York election, and Sen.
Bill Bradley's close call victory in New Jersey hurt two of the
Democrats' most appealing potential candidates.
   Other Democrats mentioned as possible entries include Nunn;
Sens. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas,
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska; Govs. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Richard Celeste of
Ohio; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   The speculation about a possible conservative challenge to Bush
in a Republican primary comes up short of likely candidates.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont has set up a political action
committee, but he quickly told a New Hampshire newspaper that it
wasn't to finance a second presidential bid. Du Pont ran in 1988.
   He said his Committee for Republican Leadership is to fight tax
increases, not to launch a presidential bid.
   Thomas Rath, who led Sen. Bob Dole's 1988 New Hampshire primary
effort, says Bush's enormous popularity for most of his first term,
and the Persian Gulf crisis, are reasons for the political
inactivity.
   ``For an extended period of time Bush's numbers were so high,
they maybe scared off challengers,'' Rath says. ``And the Middle
East has had a big impact. I don't think anyone wants to look like
they're using it for their own political gain.''
   Some welcome the change from two-year primary campaigns.
   `I'm not disappointed at all,'' Murphy says. ``I've never been a
fan of the first-in-the-nation primary. What happens in the
statehouse is much more important.''
   Mary Chambers, Democratic leader of the New Hampshire House,
also believes less is better in primary elections.
   ``Nobody is even thinking about it - they're too busy with other
things,'' she says. ``They are going to stay (in Washington) and
take care of business as long as it's so questionable about what
will happen in the Middle East.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 12,000 demonstrators marched through
the streets Tuesday to demand swifter democratic reforms and the
release of a dissident leader jailed for promoting Taiwan
independence.
   The demonstration was organized by the Democratic Progressive
Party, the main opposition to the governing Nationalist Party,
which lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949 and retreated to
Taiwan.
   Carrying chrysanthemums to symbolize a peaceful protest, the
demonstrators chanted ``(We want) independent sovereignty and
constitutional democracy!'' and ``Huang Hwa is not guilty!''
   Huang, 51, an opposition leader, was convicted of sedition
earlier this month. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for
advocating independence for Taiwan and raising funds to topple the
Nationalist government.
   The demonstration ended after three hours at a memorial park
where opposition leaders criticized the government for failing to
move faster on democratic reforms.
   About 2,000 policemen guarded the mile-long route taken by the
demonstrators, but officials reported no incidents. Most of the
demonstrators were supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party,
students, and professors.
   Earlier Tuesday, the party's eight members in the National
Assembly, Taiwan's electoral college, walked out in protest shortly
before President Lee Teng-hui delivered a speech promising to
modernize Taiwan's constitution. He also said he would end before
May a state of war declared against the rival Communist Chinese in
1948.
   The state of war included the suspension of certain
constitutional rights.
   Outside the National Assembly, about 100 students clashed
briefly with policemen who prevented them from entering the
building. The officers later agreed to allow a delegation to
present a petition.
   The National Assembly met for Constitution Day. In his address,
Lee said the government would propose amendments to the
constitution, which was enacted in 1937, and that all Assembly
members would be involved in the revisions. He said he hoped a new
constitution would be ready by mid-1992.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Envoy To Soviet Union Dead At 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUPITER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foy David Kohler, a career diplomat and the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow during the height of the Cold War, has
died at age 82.
   Kohler, who was present for the 1959 ``kitchen debate'' between
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and then-Vice President Richard
Nixon, died Sunday at Jupiter Hospital. His home was in Juno Beach.
   ``His loss is a great loss,'' said former Secretary of State
Dean Rusk. ``Foy Kohler was one of our greatest professional
diplomats. He was a lifelong member of the foreign service. He
served with great distinction.''
   Kohler was ambassador to the Soviet Union from August 1962 to
November 1966.
   He was considered a member of the realist school of
international politics, which emphasized the importance of
military, economic and political power in world affairs.
   Kohler took his first post as vice consul in Windsor, Ontario,
in 1931. Later assignments took him to Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece,
Egypt, England and Turkey. He also toured Vietnam, Pakistan and
Bolivia on fact-finding missions for U.S. aid programs, and he
served as director of the Voice of America.
   From 1941 to 1945 he served as assistant chief of the State
Department's Division of Near Eastern Affairs.
   Kohler first went to Moscow in January 1947 as first secretary
of the U.S. Embassy. He was there when Khrushchev and Nixon toured
a model American kitchen during a 1959 American exposition in
Moscow. Khrushchev became angry, and the ``kitchen debate'' between
him and Nixon drew international attention.
   President John F. Kennedy tapped the Russian-speaking diplomat -
then assistant secretary of state for European affairs - to become
ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1962.
   Shortly after he arrived in Moscow in his new post, the Cuban
missile crisis erupted and brought the world to the brink of war.
   Nonetheless, Kohler respected Khrushchev.
   ``You couldn't help but like him just as an individual,'' he
once said. ``He was a shrewd peasant and he loved to trade
repartee. He had a quick wit. It's true that Khrushchev -
especially with his de-Stalinization speech - shook up the society
and greatly eased the terror that had prevailed under Stalin. On
the other hand, Khrushchev was a true believer in Bolshevism.''
   After leaving Moscow, Kohler was undersecretary of state for
political affairs for a year.
   He retired in 1967 and then spent almost 11 years as a professor
at the University of Miami's graduate center for Advanced
International Studies.
   The hospital said Tuedsday that Kohler died after a long illness
but did not release details.
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

   Five employees of a state tax agency are
going to get to keep their jobs thanks to the cooperation of their
fellow workers.
   The five employees of the Board of Equalization and Assessment
were expected to be among the nearly 2,000 state workers being laid
off to help combat a $1 billion budget deficit in New York state.
   But their colleagues saved their jobs by volunteering to take
some time off without pay, making the agency's budget stretch a
little further, Ramon Rodriguez, assistant director of the board,
said Monday.
   The board oversees the local administration of property taxes.
   ``The holiday season probably had something to do with the good
spirit, but my sense is we're an agency that would do this any time
of the year,'' he added.
   Employees at the agency approached managers and asked that they
survey the staff to see who would be willing to give up a few days
pay to save jobs, he said. A notice went out to all employees last
week.
   In all, 279 of the board's 560 employees agreed to take one to
three days off without pay.
   ``What you have is an agency coming together as a community,''
said Rodriguez.
   That wasn't the only example of job-saving at the board. Eleven
management-level workers saved two other employees' jobs by
volunteering to give up a week of vacation pay.
   Despite such actions, the board didn't completely avoid layoffs.
   Rodriguez said two employees are taking early retirement and
three others will have to be laid off.

<HEAD>Feds Turn to Big Game Poachers for Help in Detering Illegal
Hunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal wildlife agents are using a new
weapon in their battle against big game poachers - the poachers
themselves.
   A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service program is turning convicted
poachers into video preachers. Violators tell fellow hunters and
hunting guides about the impact of the illegal killing of
grizzlies, wolves, caribou, Dall sheep, elk and other big game and
waterfowl in Alaska and the West.
   One of the biggest guns among the new anti-poaching crusaders is
longtime Alaska guide and outfitter Ron Hayes. Hayes, who was
convicted in 1987 of illegally hunting grizzly bears by airplane,
served two years in prison, forfeited several aircraft, paid
thousands of dollars in fines and lost his hunting privilege.
   ``He was probably the most notorious bandit guide that ever
lived,'' said Dave Hall, a New Orleans-based agent of the Fish and
Wildlife Service who is organizing the video project.
   Hall visited Hayes several times in prison, and helped show him
of the error of his ways. On Hall's urging, Hayes agreed to help
make a 30-minute video last summer for the service's use and to
cooperate with a National Geographic Society television documentary
on poaching to be broadcast this spring.
   Several other convicted poachers have agreed to appear in the
agency's videos.
   ``This is the only way we can make conservation enforcement
effective,'' Hall said.
   Alaska has 54.5 million acres of national park lands and just 11
patrol rangers. That comes to nearly 5 million acres per ranger.
   The National Parks and Conservation Association and some
wildlife officials contend poaching harms big game species by
depleting the strongest animals in the species, reducing the
quality of the gene pool. Other officials say there is not enough
biological evidence to support that conclusion.
   Hall has put his emphasis on guides because Alaska prohibits
non-residents from hunting big game without the services of one of
the approximately 450 guide-outfitters in the state.
   For the National Geographic Society project filmed during the
summer, Hayes re-created his poaching technique on the Katmai
National Park and Preserve by herding a grizzly to a hunting party
with his airplane.
   In a startling admission, Hayes said in the film that of the 37
grizzlies he helped hunters place in the Boone and Crockett Club's
record book, every one was shot after being herded illegally to the
hunter with an airplane.
   The National Geographic film will be broadcast this spring as
one of four segments on poaching in its ``Explorer'' series. Other
segments will deal with poaching of waterfowl and elk and a
national overview of the problem.
   Because of Alaska's size and the number of trophy animals
hunted, poaching in the state has become a major problem, officials
said.
   There are no figures for the number of animals killed illegally.
But state wildlife officials say hunters come to Alaska from around
the world seeking trophy-sized sheep, grizzlies and wolves and to
hunt moose and caribou, black bear, waterfowl and other game
animals.
   Not all poaching is for sport.
   Some hunters illegally kill big game animals for selected body
parts. Bear gall bladders are used in some Asian cultures for
medical purposes, bear claws are used to make jewelry, and caribou
antlers are ground up to make powdered potions said to enhance sex.
   Federal and state officials, however, said they are most
concerned about trophy poachers.
   The guides are under great pressure to produce trophy animals -
and have a huge financial stake in hunters' success. Guides get
paid on a per-animal basis, and can receive $7,000 or more for a
Dall sheep and between $8,000 and $10,000 for a grizzly, according
to Jim Hannah, a National Park Service district ranger in the 13
million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his partners in
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council urged Saddam Hussein on
Tuesday to withdraw from Kuwait and spare Iraq the horrors of war.
   The leaders wound up a four-day summit by insisting anew that
Iraq reinstate the exiled al-Sabah family as rulers of Kuwait and
withdraw from the emirate unconditionally before the Jan. 15
deadline set by the United Nations Security Council.
   They also demanded that Iraq pay reparations and compensation to
Kuwait and its citizens for losses suffered because of the
invasion.
   ``The council affirmed that all member countries, governments
and peoples stand solidly with the people of Kuwait until its
complete liberation,'' said a communique read by the group's
secretary-general, Abdullah Bishara.
   The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates affirmed the ``right and determination''
of the gulf allies to ``resort to all means to guarantee
restoration of sovereignty and legitimacy'' to Kuwait.
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, expressed gratitude to
the allies and said he would look forward the next summit in
liberated Kuwait.
   The summit's communique denounced Iraq for the invasion of
Kuwait, saying it had ``put the entire region on the brink of a
destructive war.''
   Summit leaders stressed the need for ensuring future regional
security through joint efforts with gulf powers and other Arab and
international powers.
   Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmed, defense minister in Kuwait's Saudi-based
government-in-exile, had indicated earlier that the summit would
consider the advisibility of asking the United States and some Arab
powers to station troops in Kuwait if it were liberated.
   Summit leaders pledged unspecified economic assistance to Arab
and Islamic countries that have supported Saudi Arabia's call for
the multinational force to stand up to Saddam.
   Proposals by defense ministers for enhancing the military
potential of the Gulf Cooperation Council member states were
ratified, the communique said. It gave no details.
   The Cooperation Council leaders had discussed bolstering their
joint defenses, which had been inadequate to counter Iraq's Aug. 2
sweep through Kuwait despite heavy spending on advanced weapons
systems and other hardware over the last decade.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that among the
plans discussed was building up the organization's rapid deployment
Peninsula Shield force from 10,000 to 50,000 men.
   Officials also said leaders decided to include Iran in their
planned contacts on long-range security strategy arrangements. The
Cooperation Council countries had sided with Iraq against Iran in
the two nations' eight-year war.

<HEAD>U.S. Jews on Soviet Jews: Israel Must Do Better</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some American Jewish leaders Tuesday criticized
Israel's performance so far in handling the influx of Soviet Jewish
immigrants.
   ``We are concerned that there is no sense of urgency,'' Seymour
Reich, outgoing chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, told a news conference.
   ``We believe it is incumbent on Israel to address this as a top
priority, using all of its resources, all of its people, all of its
government facilities,'' he said.
   About 172,000 Soviet Jews have settled in Israel this year, and
officials expect 1 million by the end of 1992. But efforts to
absorb them have run into bureaucratic and financial difficulties.
   Shoshana Cardin, the newly elected chairman of the New
York-based conference, the leading U.S. Jewish organization, said
there appeared to be a lack of coordination among ministries
dealing with immigrant absorption.
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon is at odds with Absorption
Minister Yitzhak Peretz and has accused Peretz's staff of failing
to cope with the influx. Peretz is boycotting the Cabinet
immigration committee headed by Sharon.
   ``There seems to be not that urgency of everyone working
together to ensure the maximum efficiency in the minimum amount of
time,'' Crdin said.
   She said, ``That sense of urgency will translate itself in the
diaspora'' of Jewish communities outside Israel, and encourage fund
raising and investment in this country.
   Peretz, a rabbi, has made hotly disputed claims that up to 35
percent of the Soviet immigrants are not Jewish. Other rabbis in
the government say the figure is no more than 5 percent.
   Peretz says Israel should tighten its Law of Return, which
affords automatic citizenship to all Jewish immigrants.
   Asked to comment, Cardin said: ``Anything that would deny or
impede the aliya (immigration) would be tragic at this point.''

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels said Tuesday they would
suspend fighting to mark the New Year's holiday but demanded that
army troops in northern and eastern districts be confined to
barracks during the truce.
   The offer comes after three previous cease-fires between the two
combatants ended in more bitter rounds of fighting, with each side
accusing the other of violating the truce.
   ``We will offer a unilateral cease-fire to mark the new year. It
will begin midnight Dec. 31 and may go on for two or three days,''
rebel spokesman Sathasivam Krishnakumar said in a telephone
interview from London.
   However, Defense Secretary Cyril Ranatunge said the Tamil Tiger
rebel movement cannot be trusted.
   ``Every time this kind of thing is put out, the terrorists go
back on their word,'' he said. The government routinely refers to
the rebels as terrorists.
   Gen. Ranatunge said he cannot comment on a government response
because ``it will be a political decision.''
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the 7{-year-old
secessionist war by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The longest cease-fire lasted 13 months until June 11, when the
Tigers stormed 30 police stations and army barracks along the
eastern coast, killing scores of security force personnel.
   Fierce fighting since then has left the government forces in
control of several towns in the east and the guerillas holding the
jungles and the entire northern district, including their
stronghold of Jaffna peninsula.
   The Tigers have been fighting since 1983, claiming the ethnic
Tamil minority is discriminated against by the Sinhalese in jobs
and education.
   Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. The mostly Buddhist Sinhalese account for 75
percent of the population and dominate the government and the
military.

   Heavy winds on Tuesday blew down the top of a
church tower, sending it crashing through the roof during a
Christmas service. Police said four people were slightly injured.
   Gales and heavy rain swept across Britain, and thousands of
homes were without power to cook Christmas dinners. Roads were
closed by floods and fallen trees.
   Police said four people suffered cuts and bruises from the
falling masonry at the Anglican parish church of Kingston St.
Michael near Chippenham in southwestern England. They were given
first aid at Chippenham District Hospital and released.
   One man had just moved from a seat that was flattened, and
debris landed ``inches away'' from the clergyman, police said.
   The royal family, led by Queen Elizabeth II, clung to their hats
and shivered in the cold when they attended a morning church
service in the village of Sandringham in Norfolk.
   Sandringham, 105 miles northeast of London, is a favorite royal
winter retreat.
   Princess Diana's hat blew off in the churchyard and she carried
it in her hand as she and her husband, Prince Charles, walked back
to the mansion.
   Elsewhere in England, winds toppled chimneys and power cables,
cutting off electricity to thousands of homes.
   Homes were without power in the southern counties of Kent,
Hampshire and Devon, in Worcestershire along the Welsh border and
in Staffordshire in the English Midlands.

   A student charged with insulting President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev by calling him ``a fascist criminal'' went on trial
Tuesday, the Tass news agency reported.
   The trial of Tamara Tselikova opened in the city of Tver,
formerly Kalinin, 100 miles northwest of Moscow, and was expected
to last three days, Tass said.
   Ms. Tselikova was arrested on Sept. 29 for passing out leaflets
that said ``Gorbachev has smeared his hands with blood in Baku and
Tbilisi and is a fascist criminal, just like Lenin, Stalin or
Khrushchev,'' Tass reported.
   The leaflets referred to Kremlin military crackdowns in Baku,
the capital of Azerbaijan, last January, and in Tbilisi, the
capital of Georgia, in 1989.
   The news agency did not say what happened on the first day of
her trial or what punishment she faces if convicted.
   The Soviet legislature passed the law on slandering the
president in May after a May Day demonstration in which protesters
shouted insults at Gorbachev and other leaders in Red Square.
   In July, unemployed Muscovite Gennady Smirnov, 40, was the first
person arrested under the law. Moscow newspapers said he displayed
a portrait of Gorbachev marred by insulting and slanderous drawings
and words.
   Smirnov, who faced a fine of up to 3,000 rubles, a two-year
prison camp term or the deprivation of freedom for three years,
underwent a medical examination to determine his mental condition.
The disposition of his case is not known.

   Christmas is the name, and getting their

   ``It's awful hard to get a pizza delivered,'' said Greg
Christmas of northeast Indianapolis.
   He said it took some coaxing to persuade his wife, Mary, to take
his last name.
   ``It helps that most people call her Mary Ann,'' he said.
   Even junk mail senders are skeptical.

Santa,'' he said.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Says Some Western Aid Stolen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs and end of story with KGB chief's comments on
Shevardnadze, emigration. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some of the Western humanitarian aid pouring into
the Soviet Union has been stolen, but more than 99 percent is
reaching the people who need it most, the KGB chairman said
Tuesday.
   Some Western donors have expressed concern that in the
chronically corrupt Soviet economy, the aid could be stolen,
siphoned off to the black market or otherwise abused.
   At a news conference at the Congress of People's Deputies, the
Soviet parliament, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov did not say what
was stolen or how much.
   He said only that ``minor cases'' of theft had been discovered
by the KGB. The Soviet legislature has asked the police agency to
ensure proper distribution of donated food, medical and other
supplies.
   Kryuchkov shrugged off the State Department's condemnation of
his speech to the Soviet Congress on Saturday in which he accused
the CIA and other ``outside forces'' of trying to pressure the
Soviet Union and ``impose doubtful ideas and plans.''
   The condemnation, the KGB chief said, ``does not produce much
enthusiasm in me.''
   Referring to his speech, he said, ``I think they will go back,
read it again and understand it better.''
   Kryuchkov said between 440,000 and 460,000 Soviet citizens had
emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries in 1990,
and ``it's entirely possible the number will not decline'' in 1991.
   ``I think that's an awful lot for us, and I would say that when
people are leaving their native country, that is not a good sign
for the condition of the society,'' he said.
   Kryuchkov said he was sorry that Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned
last week as foreign minister, adding, ``Personally, I had a good
relationship with him.''
   But Kryuchkov rejected Shevardnadze's contention that the
country was heading toward dictatorship.
   ``I am deeply convinced that in the event our president invokes
emergency measures, it would mean just introducing order, which we
all feel the lack of,'' he said.
   ``It's being demanded, by the way, from the left, the right and
the center.''

   Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland spent their sixth Christmas in captivity Tuesday and
newspapers printed greetings from Anderson's family and a photo of
the daughter he has never held.
   ``Perhaps our miracle will happen and we'll welcome you home in
time to share the beginning of the new year,'' wrote Peggy Say,
Anderson's sister.
   For Anderson, the longest held Western hostage in Lebanon, it
was another macabre milestone in his ordeal. The 43-year-old chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, 59, of Fort Collins, Colo., is the second-longest
held American among the 13 missing Westerners. He was dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
kidnapped on June 9, 1985.
   The other captives are four Americans, four Britons, two Germans
and an Italian.
   Beirut's eight major newspapers carried messages for Anderson
from Mrs. Say, his 5-year-old daughter Sulome - born four months
after he was kidnapped - and Sulome's mother, Madeleine.
   The leftist as-Safir daily also published greetings to British
hostage John McCarthy from his family and friends on his fifth
Christmas as a captive.
   McCarthy, 34, a London-based television journalist, was
kidnapped on April 17, 1986, as he drove to Beirut Airport to catch
a flight for London.
   The message to McCarthy, in a paid advertisement, urged him to
``stay as cheerful as you can and be assured we all miss you and
love you.''
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group believed made up of
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots, claims it holds Anderson and
Sutherland.
   Most of the 11 other Western hostages, including McCarthy,
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite and the other Americans, are
believed held by Shiite fanatics.
   The archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, spoke Tuesday of
his sorrow at the continued detention of his envoy, Waite.
   ``Naturally, I have hoped that Terry would be back with us this
Christmas, and I'm sad that we have still not secured his return,''
the archbishop said in an interview on Sky TV in London.
   Runcie, who retires on Jan. 31, said he hoped to see Waite
released before then but he did not indicate that he had any
information that it would happen.
   Beirut's independent an-Nahar ran the English text of the
letters sent to Anderson with full Arabic translations.
   The French-language L'Orient-Le Jour carried the text of the two
messages from Mrs. Say and Sulome's mother in English and French
along with the latest photograph of his youngest daughter.
   Both newspapers said they hoped the kidnappers would let
Anderson read the letters and see the picture of his daughter.
   ``We are united with you in spirit always. But Christmas and the
holidays make it especially difficult to accept the fact of not
being with you in body,'' Sulome's mother wrote. ``We are so near
you and yet so far. But our hopes are always high for a bright
future and reunion forever. Merry Christmas to all of you.''
   Mrs. Say told Anderson that his elder daughter, Gabrielle, was
``a blossoming young woman. ... She's a big girl now and captain of
her soccer team. She's attending the school you wanted for her and
is doing excellently.''
   Mrs. Say expressed her hope that this would be her brother's
last Christmas in captivity.
   ``Your friends have remained committed to your cause and we are
all working hard for your release,'' she wrote.
   ``Especially at Christmas, I received letters from all over the
United States telling me of the thousands that work and pray for
you every day.
   ``You and and your fellow hostages are not forgotten, Terry, and
you will never be. For every day that you suffer, thousands of
Americans agonize with you,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``There is a God, Terry, and although neither you nor I can
guess why this terrible situation has been allowed to continue, we
must remain secure in the knowledge that some day, some way this
will end.
   ``Until then, please keep well and listen in the quiet for the
love and prayers that are sent to you and the others every hour,
every day. May God hold you close to him.''
   Sutherland's wife, Jean, spent the day in seclusion at her
quarters at the American University. Friends said she wanted to
remain alone to share Christmas with her husband in her thoughts.
   Iranian officials and Lebanese Shiite fundamentalists have been
predicting for months that all the hostages would be freed before
the year was out. But as the last remaining days of 1990 dwindle,
so do hopes.
   Five have been freed this year, a record for a single year since
1983, when Shiites unleashed their anti-Western campaign of
kidnappings, suicide bombings and aircraft hijackings.
   American educators Robert Polhill and Frank Reed were released
in April. Swiss Red Cross workers Emanuel Christen and Elio
Erriquez as well as Irishman Brian Keenan were freed in August.

   Moscow's first consul in Israel since 1967
presented his credentials Tuesday, underscoring growing warmth
between the Jewish state and the Soviet Union at a time when Soviet
Jews are emigrating in record numbers.
   In a similar ceremony in Moscow, Arieh Levine presented his
credentials to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to
become Israel's consul to the Soviet Union.
   At the office of Foreign Minister David Levy in Jerusalem,
Alexei F. Chistyakov said he felt honored to be Moscow's consul to
Israel and would do everything to nurture relations between the
countries.
   The diplomat, who spoke in Russian through a translator,
promised to foster a ``political dialogue'' between Jerusalem and
Moscow. He said the new relations would ``help to reach a stable
peace in the Middle East, which guarantees the rights of all the
peoples and countries in the region, as well as the interests of
the international community.''
   Eventually, he said, ties would be normalized.
   Moscow severed diplomatic relations with Israel 23 years ago
after Israel captured land from the Soviet Union's Arab allies
during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Soviets have hinged a full resumption of ties on Israel
making concessions to the Palestinians through an international
peace conference.
   Israel maintains that the break in relations was unjustified
because it was the Arabs who caused the 1967 war. It rejects the
peace conference formula, fearing it will be forced into making
dangerous territorial concessions.
   Nonetheless, the effects of Soviet political reforms have been
felt here since June 1987, when the Soviets sent a temporary
diplomatic delegation to Tel Aviv. It became permanent, so Israel
insisted on reciprocity and was allowed to dispatch a consular
group to Moscow a year later.
   Cultural, economic and sports exchanges followed. Israel aided
Armenian earthquake victims and last month sent food supplies to
Moscow. Leningrad museum authorities signed an agreement to give
Israel a priceless collection of Jewish historical documents.
   Most dramatic is the influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants. About
172,000 have arrived this year, and at this rate they will
transform the Jewish state socially, economically and
demographically in a few years.
   The Soviet mission, operating out of a Tel Aviv office, now
becomes a consulate under Chistyakov. Its main functions will
include issuing visas to Israelis visiting the Soviet Union,
helping Soviet tourists in Israel who run into problems, mediating
property claims between the two countries and acting as a political
channel between the Kremlin and the Israeli government.
   Chistyakov has held diplomatic postings in Yemen, Egypt and
Lebanon, where he was stationed during Israel's 1982 invasion. He
was posted to Israel in April.
   The opening of consulates in Jerusalem and Moscow stems from an
agreement reached in September between Levy and Shevardnadze.
   There had been uncertainty about whether Levin would be able to
present his credentials in Moscow because of Shevardnadze's
announcement last week that he will resign.
   Speaking in Hebrew, Moroccan-born Levy joined ``the many voices
in the Soviet Union calling on Mr. Shevardnadze to continue with
his job and his mission.''
   ``I wish the Soviet Union a speedy recovery on the way it has
set for itself, the way of democracy, freedom and peace,'' he said.
   Levy said he was proud to be the first Israeli foreign minister
to receive an accredited Soviet diplomat in 23 years.
   ``The relations between our countries are on a good road now,''
he said.

<HEAD>Struggling Auto Industry Prepares to Put on Best Face at Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The auto industry puts its best face forward
during the next two months with elaborate displays at the annual
series of winter auto shows, overshadowed by a cloud of recession.
   The first two shows will begin Jan. 12 in Detroit and Los
Angeles. The Detroit show runs through Jan. 20. By the time spring
rolls around, major shows also will have been held in Chicago and
New York.
   But underneath the glitz and glamour, automakers are facing
their darkest days since the early 1980s, when Chrysler Corp.
brushed with bankruptcy, Ford Motor Co. wondered if it would
survive and General Motors Corp.'s dominance began fading.
   New car and truck sales are in a tailspin, partly because of
sagging consumer confidence, worry about conflict in the Middle
East and a slowing economy. Through November, car and light truck
sales in the United States totaled about 13.2 million, down nearly
5 percent from last year.
   If automaker executives are correct, the industry will take
another 5 percent hit in its sales rate next year.
   Each of the Big Three has predicted dire financial results for
the fourth quarter, and it appears that Chrysler could wind up
losing money in 1990. It would be the first annual loss posted by
an automaker since 1982, when Ford took a $658 million loss.
   None of that will be visible at the shows. In fact, it will be
well hidden behind fake waterfalls, a simulated test track and
dozens of ``concept cars,'' or not-for-production vehicles made to
show off an automaker's technical and design expertise.
   Ford has redesigned its Detroit exhibit, doing away with
turntables and leggy models, opting instead for more
consumer-oriented actors talking about the company's cars and
trucks.
   That's not to say the Ford exhibit will be without glitter.
There will be a 40-foot-wide curtain of cascading water as a
backdrop in the center of the display.
   GM will have a simulation of a test track at its corporate
exhibit, which also will feature displays emphasizing environmental
efforts.
   Among the concept cars will be Ford's ``Zig'' and ``Zag,'' a
pair of tiny runabouts from the Ghia Design Studio in Italy. The
Zig looks like a bar of Dove soap - a two-seat convertible. The Zag
looks like a bar of Dove with a hardtop.

<HEAD>Record Cold Christmas for Some, Warming Trends Elsewhere</HEAD>

   It was the coldest Christmas on record in many cities across the
West, and the week-old cold wave that has caused millions in damage
to California produce also nipped some of the flowers needed for
Rose Bowl parade floats.
   Flood victims in Tennessee began returning home to clean up the
damage but some in Alabama and Mississippi were still kept out of
their homes by high water.
   Weather-related deaths since Dec. 18 had risen to 81.
   The cold also began to take a toll on air quality as people
turned to wood-burning stoves and fire places for heat. Air in
Oregon's Eugene-Springfield area was rated unhealthful Tuesday
morning because of particulates; wood smoke is a major source of
such pollution.
   Albuquerque, N.M., had its coldest Christmas on record at 1
degree. Eugene, Ore., had a record low of 15, the seventh day in a
row the city's morning low matched or set a record. Tuesday's low
of 19 in Portland, Ore., was the fourth record low in five days.
Gallup, N.M., awoke to 25 below zero. Temperatures across North
Dakota were 10 to 20 below, and wind blowing at 10 to 20 mph made
it feel like more than 40 below.
   But Texas warmed to seasonal normals on Christmas Day.
Temperatures in southern Texas reached the 50s for the first time
since the cold wave pummeled the state Friday. Arizona also warmed
up slightly, with lows of 33 in Phoenix and 35 in Yuma.
   A slight warming trend was predicted for the rest of the week in
California, but agricultural officials said it was too late for
crops damaged by the cold.
   In Tulare County, where most of California's navel orange crop
is grown, Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft estimated a $200
million loss to this year's harvest.
   Sunkist Growers Inc. cooperative spokeswoman Claire Peters said
initial estimates show 50 percent of the citrus crop may be
damaged. Some may be salvaged for juice, she said.
   Growers said fruit on trees in the southern San Joaquin Valley
was a total loss, and trees three years or younger are likely
damaged, the National Weather Service reported.
   Arizona's $70 million citrus crop may have escaped the cold wave
with little damage, several citrus experts and growers said.
   The cold also threatened some of the flower-covered floats in
Pasadena's Tournament of Roses New Year's Day parade.
   Rick Chapman, whose firm builds 11 floats, faced two problems:
the cold damaged flower crops in California, and fresh flowers from
Florida and South America were on trucks that were stuck someplace
east of California.
   ``The snow and icy roads are delaying delivery,'' he said.
   Some 12,000 people in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San
Francisco were without water both because frozen pipes burst and
because some people tried to prevent them from bursting.
   District President Fred Nitz, who declared a state of emergency,
said many customers let their taps run to prevent freezeup, costing
the agency 900 gallons of water a minute.
   Plumbers in Albuquerque stopped taking house calls to thaw
frozen pipes by noon Monday. ``It's been awful,'' said Jules
Appelman of Academy Plumbing. At least two fires in Albuquerque
were blamed on homeowners' attempts to thaw frozen pipes.
   ``Everyone who came into the store today either had broken water
pipes or frozen ones,'' said Kathy Cushing, owner of a store in
Cedar Crest, N.M., east of Albuquerque.
   ``We are getting at least 500 calls a day,'' said Barbara
Chriswell of Olson Plumbing and Heating in Colorado Springs, Colo.
``We have waiting lists. We are swamped. We're working around the
clock.''
   In the Southeast, the problem was flooding caused by heavy rain
that developed ahead of the cold air mass.
   Tennesseans returned to their homes to clean up after weekend
flooding that contributed to several deaths and hundreds of
evacuations.
   About 150 families remained out of their homes Tuesday in
Columbus, Miss., where high water from the Tennessee-Tombigbee
River and two creeks flooded roads and houses and businesses.
   Two to three dozen families remained out of their homes in
Alabama's Lawrence County, which has the rain-swollen Tennessee
River as its northern border. Flooding also was reported in several
other counties.

   Flight crew member Stephanie Harr
ran out on the deck of the USNS Mercy hospital ship Tuesday to
bellow ``Merry Christmas'' to her family in San Antonio.
   Specialist John Davidson of the 37th Airborne Engineer Battalion
pulled guard duty in a sandstorm on Christmas day. ``Everybody here
is down and depressed,'' he said.
   Bob Hope, meanwhile, tailored his 50th year of entertaining
troops at Christmas to a devout Moslem land.
   The 300,000 U.S. troops sent to Saudi Arabia under Operation
Desert Shield marked Christmas - Day 140 of the deployment - with a
bittersweet mix of holiday cheer and homesickness.
   Santa made several appearances. He reached the 1,000-bed
hospital ship Mercy after the AWACs surveillance planes spotted a
low-flying object and reported that it was ``a sleigh, pulled by
deer and driven by an old man.''
   He also appeared in a bunker.
   Spec. Chad Dombrosky, 20, of Milton-Freewater, Ore., was on
guard duty when at the stroke of midnight he alerted the sergeant
of the guard of unusual activity: ``There's a fat guy in a red suit
with a bag full of gifts who wants to come into the camp, but he
doesn't know the password,'' Dombrosky said.
   The best present the troops could have received was to be with
loved ones.
   ``I'd like to be home for Christmas, but the military is our
second family,'' said Joseph Leo, 20, of Des Moines, Iowa. Leo was
brought to the hospital ship three days ago with internal bleeding.
   In a nearby bed, Sgt. Danny Barrick, 30, of Carlyle, Pa., stared
ruefully at his broken leg - injured in a desert football game -
that will earn him a spot on a plane home.
   His Christmas wish?
   ``Hopefully I'll get this drip taken out of my arm,'' he said,
pointing to the intravenous tubes next to him. But Christmas in a
hospital bed was much ``better than sitting out there with the sand
blowing over you,'' he said.
   First Sgt. Charles Rio, 39, of Fayetteville, N.C., received a
most unlikely gift from his son: a fishing lure to catch ``land
bass.''
   His unit, the 37th Battalion, received a 90-minute videotape
from a family support group. Troops viewed the tape for the first
time on Christmas.
   Pfc. Raymond Waldorf, 25, of Greenville, Mich. saw his wife,
2-year-old son and 5-month-old daughter on the tape.
   ``It brightened up an otherwise gloomy day,'' Waldorf said.
   The armed forces radio network avoided most songs with a
religious theme to avoid hurting Saudi sensibilities. The kingdom,
which uses the Moslem holy book, the Koran, as the basis for all
laws, bans other religions.
   Bob Hope was back with the troops for Christmas but he had to
leave Marie Osmond, the Pointer Sisters and other ``girls'' in his
tour behind in Bahrain because Saudi Arabia bans female
entertainers.
   Instead, Hope took former Cincinnatti Reds catcher Johnny Bench
and country and western singer Aaron Tippon to visit the troops.
   The U.S. military barred the media from covering Hope's shows,
saying his repertoire ``could be exploited by the Iraqis for
propaganda purposes,'' but Hope delivered some of his patois at a
news conference on Tuesday morning.
   He said he was briefed on Saudi sensitivities three times and
tailored his show to avoid offending Moslems, eliminating jokes
about American men and Saudi women.
   Chief Warrant Officer Wesley Wolf, the military's food czar,
made sure that one part of Christmas tradition was intact in the
desert - the menu.
   Everybody received turkey, ham, roast beef and all the
trimmings. And troops didn't lack for desert - there were stacks of
cookies almost reaching the height of sandbags.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, however, was not entirely forgotten.
The Arab News newspaper has been running a ``K-day'' countdown
showing the number of days Iraq has until the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline
for it to pull out of Kuwait or face the possibility of a military
strike by the U.S.-led forces.
   The paper wrote:
   ``Twas the night before `K-Day'
   and all through Kuwait,
   no Iraqi was leaving;
   they had sealed their fate.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told Jordanian politicians
visiting Baghdad Tuesday that he wouldn't leave Kuwait until Israel
withdrew from the occupied territories.
   ``Let all the fleets and Israel hear, Palestine comes first and
it must be liberated,'' Saddam said.
   In other gulf-related developments Tuesday:
   -The New York Times reported that 20 North Korean military
advisers arrived in Baghdad to help Iraq repair its Soviet-made MiG
warplanes. The report, quoting Asian diplomats, said North Korea
also was to provide spare parts the Soviets have stopped shipping
Iraq in compliance with the U.N.-imposed embargo.
   -Iraqi newspapers said in Christmas editorials that Baghdad
would never surrender and warned President Bush that many American
lives would be lost in any war with Iraq.
   -Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Arens said he had seen no
significant change in the gulf crisis that indicated heightened
danger for Israel. Newspapers had said a day earlier the military
was on higher alert and had reinforced its defenses along the
border with Jordan.
   -The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council wound up a four-day
summit by urging Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from
Kuwait and spare Iraq the horrors of war.
   -The Iraqi army newspaper Al-Qadissiya reported that Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim might travel to Baghdad in early January to
try to defuse the crisis. Waldheim said on Austrian state-run ORF
television Monday night that he was planning a trip to Oman and
possibly other Arab countries and would work for peace using
contacts he made while U.N. secretary-general from 1972 to 1981.

<HEAD>King Michael Arrives on Surprise Visit to Romania</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes, details. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's former monarch, King
Michael, arrived Tuesday on a surprise visit more than 40 years
after being forced into abdication and exile by the now-ousted
Communist leadership.
   Michael, 69, arrived in a private jet from Switzerland, where he
lives.
   The former king, of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house, was
accompanied by his wife, Ana de Bourbon-Parme, and daughter,
Sophie. They arrived in the country without visas or other
authorization and were met by another daughter, Margarita, already
in Romania on a visit.
   The royal family returned exactly one year after former
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena were
summarily tried and executed, formally ending the Communist rule
that had forced Michael into exile in 1948.
   Margarita told reporters his return was ``probably like being
born... Very painful and very happy at the same time.
   ``He has been a person ripped in two all his life and the two
bits have suddenly come together,'' she said.
   It was the former king's first to Romania since going into
exile. He had planned to visit Romania last April but the
government refused to let him return.
   The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying Michael, his
wife and daughter ``crossed the border fraudulently'' and will have
to ``bear the legal consequences.'' The statement did not
elaborate.
   But Michael emerged from immigration about an hour after
landing, beaming as he displayed his Danish diplomatic passport.
   He and his family then sped off in a waiting car to a monastery
at Curtea de Arges, 87 miles west of Bucharest, where the king's
ancestors are buried.
   Danielle Maillefer, a spokeswoman, said the royal family decided
to visit Romania on short notice. Princess Margarita informed
Premier Petre Roman of their plans on Christmas Eve, Maillefer
said.
   Roman ``strongly advised him not to come, but did not give a
firm yes or no,'' Maillefer said. Michael ``felt he has a role to
play in Romania,'' and so he decided to ignore Roman's advice, she
said.
   Government officials were throught to be displeased by the
monarchist nostalgia the visit could stir.
   The former king ruled Romania twice for short periods. He first
succeeded his grandfather Ferdinand in 1927 as Michael I, after his
father, Carol, was excluded from the succession.
   Carol acceded to the throne in 1930 and ruled for 10 years.
Michael was then crowned again and reigned until he was forced to
abdicate when the Communists took power in 1947.

<HEAD>Boat Crews Replay Washington's Historic River Crossing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON'S CROSSING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oarsmen and history buffs
rowed across the Delaware River Tuesday, re-enacting the Christmas
Day maneuver by George Washington and his troops that helped turn
around the Revolutionary War.
   More than 15,000 people cheered the arrival of the four wooden
boats that carried 120 men in colonial costume from Pennsylvania to
New Jersey.
   At the bow of one boat stood James Gallagher, who has portrayed
Washington in the annual crossing since 1985. He wore a
tri-cornered hat, buff trousers, a blue coat with gold buttons and
a navy cape lined with red.
   ``It was great, a fabulous crossing, a memorable occasion,''
Gallagher said afterward.
   ``We were doing it for patriotism and freedom,'' he said. ``I
also paid tribute to our troops in Saudi Arabia and hoped they
would be back soon and safely, and there was a brief silent
prayer.''
   It was the largest gathering since the 1976 bicentennial
celebration attracted a record 26,000 people for the annual event.
This year's crossing was the 38th annual one organized by the
Washington Crossing Park Foundation and the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission.
   Those portraying Washington's soldiers included students, senior
citizens, teachers, businessmen, lawyers and doctors. They came
from elsewhere in Pennsylvania as well as Delaware, Indiana, New
York, California and other states.
   The festive arrival in 30-degree weather and bright afternoon
sun contrasted with the original crossing, conducted in pre-dawn
darkness during wartime.
   That crossing was made after 2,400 troops in Washington's ragged
Continental Army had suffered defeat after defeat. They were
ferried in the darkness with artillery, cannons, horses and
ammunition.
   Once across, Washington and his troops marched nine miles in a
blizzard to Trenton, N.J., where they surprised the celebrating
British and their German mercenaries and captured many prisoners.
The victory turned around a war that had appeared lost.

   A half-dozen cities reported record lows again Tuesday as the
cold wave continued, and heavy snow fell around the Great Lakes.
   Record lows were 1 at Albuquerque, N.M.; 23 at Bakersfield,
Calif.; 20 below zero at Boise, Idaho; 15 at Eugene, Ore.; 22 at
Sacramento, Calif.; and 9 below at Winslow, Ariz.
   It was the sixth straight day of records for Sacramento, and the
seventh day in a row of record lows for Eugene.
   Gallup, N.M., dipped to 25 below zero. West Yellowstone, Mont.,
was the cold spot in the Lower 48 states with a low of 30 below
zero.
   Squalls associated with a weather system crossing the Great
Lakes produced heavy snow in western New York state and Upper
Michigan late Monday and Tuesday morning.
   Overnight snowfall totals in upstate New York ranged up to 10
inches around Boonville and Barns Corners. Up to 7 inches of new
snow blanketed the Keweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan.
   Light snow and freezing rain were reported in parts of the
Pacific Northwest.
   Another batch of cold arctic air was pouring into the central
part of the nation.
   Temperatures plunged below zero during the night from the
northern high Plains to Minnesota and northern Wisconsin, with
readings of 15 to 20 below reported from Montana to northwestern
Minnesota.
   Temperatures rose little during the day and were 10 below zero
or colder from northeastern Montana through North Dakota to
northern Minnesota. international Falls and Bemidji, Minn., were
still 18 degrees below zero at noon.
   Some of the lower wind chill factors reported across the region
at midday included 61 below zero at Minot, N.D.; 62 below zero at
Duluth, Minn., and Jamestown, N.D.; and 68 below zero at Devils
Lake, N.D.
   Snow covered the ground on Christmas Day from the northern
Pacific Coast through the Rockies to the upper Ohio Valley and the
northern Appalachians.
   The deepest snow cover outside of mountainous areas was in the
north central states, with 18 inches of snow reported on the ground
at International Falls.

<HEAD>Five Recordings Inducted Into Recording Academy's Hall of Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences has inducted blues and jazz numbers, big band music
and Broadway musicals into its Hall of Fame for this year.
   The academy, which also bestows the annual Grammy Awards, has
selected pre-1958 musical pieces for its Hall of Fame since 1974.
The Grammys were first awarded in 1958.
   This year's Hall of Fame recordings are ``Call It Stormy
Monday,'' ``Misty,'' ``Moonlight Serenade,'' ``Show Boat,'' and the
original cast album of ``West Side Story.''
   ``Call It Stormy Monday'' is a blues piece recorded in 1947 by
Aaron T-Bone Walker, who died in 1975. He helped develop the modern
blues sound with his electric guitar style.
   ``Misty'' was recorded by pianist Erroll Garner in 1954 and is
his most famous composition. Garner, a self-taught musician, died
in 1977.
   ``Moonlight Serenade'' was the late Glen Miller's theme song,
and is the second of his works to be inducted into the Hall of
Fame. ``In the Mood'' was inducted in 1983. Miller recorded
``Moonlight Serenade,'' which helped his band to a top spot among
American dance bands, in 1939.
   ``Show Boat,'' recorded by Jerome Kern in 1932, was the first
album of show music recorded in the United States. The voices of
Paul Robeson and Helen Morgan are among those on the album.
   The original cast album of Leonard Bernstein's ``West Side
Story'' was produced and released in 1957. It featured Carol
Lawrence and Larry Kert.
   The recordings were chosen by the academy's 100-member Elections
Committee, which considers recommendations from the academy's 8,000
members.

^Glowing with Christmas Spirit, IRS Delays Forms</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something will be missing when Americans open
their mailboxes Wednesday. The annual greeting from the Internal
Revenue Service will not be included in the post-holiday deluge of
late Christmas cards.
   The IRS did not forget. It's simply that the agency no longer
wants to be the Grinch who stole Christmas.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. decreed the mailing of 108
million tax packages should take place on Dec. 28, not on the day
after Christmas as it has for more than a decade.
   ``We wanted to move it away from the Christmas holiday to allow
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can
before we throw a wet blanket on them,'' said Arthur Altman,
director of the IRS tax forms division.
   The reprieve is brief. The IRS still seeks to get the forms
delivered by the first week in January to insure plenty of
preparation time before the April 15 filing deadline.
   The mailing is the biggest and most expensive the government
does each year, costing $29 million for printing and postage.
   For the second year in a row, Americans will find few changes.
   The amounts for the standard deduction and personal exemption
have been adjusted to reflect the effects of inflation; the
self-employed will find a new deduction replacing the
self-employment tax credit.
   Otherwise, the forms look much like last year's.
   A major difference is not in the forms themselves but in the
type of form each taxpayer receives.
   Some 4.5 million elderly taxpayers used to getting Form 1040
will get the shorter Form 1040A. The change was made possible when
the IRS added lines allowing the elderly to report retirement
income that previously could be reported only on the longer 1040.
   Among other changes from last year:
   - The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from
taxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases
from $2,000 to $2,050.
   - The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,
rises to $3,250 for a single person, up from $3,100. The exemption
for a couple increases to $5,450, up from $5,200.
   - Families with income as high as $20,264 may qualify for an
earned-income credit, up from a limit of $19,340. The maximum
credit available is $953.
   - The basic tax rates remain at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33
percent, but the tax brackets have been widened so that more income
will be taxed at a lower rate, thus compensating for the effects of
inflation.
   Once again this year, the IRS is encouraging people to file
their returns electronically - 4 million taxpayers did it last
year. Tax preparers normally charge between $25 and $50 for this
service but the taxpayer gets his refund check sooner - normally
within two to three weeks, versus five to six weeks for paper tax
returns.
   The IRS expects 113 million returns will be filed with refunds
going to 70 percent of all taxpayers. Last year, more than 76
million refunds were issued averaging about $900 each.
   The IRS is making an effort to debunk a myth concerning the
pre-printed mailing labels, which cut down on IRS processing
errors. Some people have refused to use the labels, believing they
contained secret codes that targeted some returns for audits.
   By explaining what each letter and number in the labels means,
the IRS hopes to boost their use.
   ``We are trying to assure taxpayers that none of the numbers in
the label are a secret code that says, `Audit this return,' ''
Altman said.
   Troops stationed in Saudi Arabia will be among those receiving
tax packages but they, like all Americans living overseas, have
until June 15 to file.
   The IRS expects two-thirds of all taxpayers to file Form 1040.
The remaining one-third will use either the shorter Form 1040A, for
people who do not itemize and whose income is below $50,000, or the
nine-line Form 1040EZ, which can be used only by single people who
do not itemize and who earn less than $50,000 with interest income
of less than $400.
   Those who need tax forms other than those included in their
package can call a new IRS toll free number, 1-800-TAX-FORM
(1-800-829-3676). Forms will also be available at many banks, post
offices and libraries.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won sweeping new
powers over a reorganized executive branch Tuesday, despite Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's warning that the country was
heading toward dictatorship.
   Gorbachev turned back attempts by reformist lawmakers to limit
his authority to issue presidential decrees, which he says he needs
along with government reorganization to restore order in the
country. He angrily said such restriction would be the ``funeral of
executive power.''
   Approval by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies was a
clear victory for Gorbachev and for hard-line lawmakers who have
urged emergency rule over secessionist republics. In his stunning
resignation speech Thursday, Shevardnadze said hard-liners were
pushing this country to dictatorship.
   Parliament voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments
that eliminate Gorbachev's moribund Presidential Council, create a
powerful new vice presidency subordinate to Gorbachev, and form a
new Cabinet of Ministers under Gorbachev's direct control.
   It strengthened Gorbachev's existing Federation Council, the
centerpiece of his reorganization, but modified his vision of it as
a small governing body, creating doubt about its effectiveness.
   The council is intended to give republics a greater voice in
national government and help the Kremlin deal with the nation's
more than 100 ethnic groups. It will also try to settle the
multiple regional conflicts, which have led to bloodshed in the
Caucasus, Moldavia and Central Asia.
   The changes will go into effect only after a final vote expected
Wednesday or Thursday. The Congress still must consider proposed
amendments on the restructuring, including one that would create a
national Security Council led by the president.
   The Congress is due to finish work by Friday.
   The flurry of votes came on the session's eighth day, after
Shevardnadze's resignation and Saturday's harsh speech by KGB chief
Vladimir Kryuchkov accusing foreign agents of plotting against the
Kremlin.
   Some reform-minded lawmakers expressed outrage over giving the
president more power.
   ``Haven't we learned anything from the resignation of
Shevardnadze over the coming dictatorship?'' asked Vologda deputy
Vladimir Lopatin.
   Congress chairman Anatoly Lukyanov cut off Lopatin's microphone,
saying he was not speaking about the amendment at hand.
   Before the session began Tuesday, Russian republic leader Boris
N. Yeltsin condemned plans to broaden Gorbachev's power and said he
intended to vote against them in the parliament, the state news
agency Tass said.
   Yeltsin, Gorbachev's leading political rival, said he opposed
``absolute powers for the president of the U.S.S.R,'' according to
the independent news agency Interfax.
   Gorbachev wants to establish a strong presidency, combined with
a new Union Treaty, to hold the country together. The Congress
endorsed the concept of the Union Treaty on Monday and ordered the
15 republics to set dates for referenda on whether to stay in the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev strolled into the lobby during a break in the session
and said his strategy would settle political crises.
   ``I am sure that if we come to understand each other in the next
few months, we shall be able to stabilize within the next year,''
he said.
   The parliament voted 1,514-140, with 140 abstentions, to revamp
and strengthen the Federation Council, created last March.
   Gorbachev and the new vice president would head the council. It
would include high-level officials from the 15 republics and about
20 autonomous republics, plus special representatives from smaller
regions, officials said.
   It would have 35-40 standing members, but up to 150 people could
attend meetings, making it a small ``general assembly,'' said
Alexander Kudryavtsev, chairman of the commission that drafted the
amendments.
   How effective the Federation Council could be as ruling body
with that many people was unclear. Gorbachev initially had not
intended to include so many.
   The parliament voted 1,620-35, with 73 abstentions, to create a
Cabinet of Ministers, which will be an ``executive and
administrative organ of the Soviet Union ... subordinate to the
president.''
   It would oversee the economy, with responsibility for financial
and monetary policy, energy, transportation, communications and
other fields.
   The present Council of Ministers, under Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, answers to the national Supreme Soviet legislature and has
exercised a degree of independence from Gorbachev, particularly
over economic matters.
   The vice president might take over some functions now performed
by the prime minister.
   Gorbachev has said nothing of possible candidates for the new
job except that he had planned to nominate Shevardnadze. The
foreign minister has said he would not accept the post.
   The deputies voted to eliminate the 9-month-old Presidential
Council, which had been envisioned as a new Cabinet but was stifled
by conflicts with Ryzhkov's Council of Ministers.
   To Gorbachev's annoyance, reformers repeatedly proposed
amendments to require legislative approval for his decrees, each
time falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.
   Gorbachev now can issue orders without any oversight, although
many republics have been ignoring the decrees.
   ``If every day the president has to issue orders ... and each of
them has to be ratified by the Supreme Soviet ... then I tell you,
that's the funeral of executive power. It would be better to leave
things as they are,'' Gorbachev said.

   An anti-domestic violence coalition is asking
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner to follow the lead of Ohio's governor
and free women imprisoned for assaulting or killing abusive
husbands or partners.
   The steering committee of the King County Coalition Against
Domestic Violence wants Gardner to review the cases of 65 women
serving time in state prison.
   The committee made the request in a letter to Gardner over the
weekend after Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste on Friday commuted the
sentences of 25 battered women in his state. The women were
convicted of assaulting or killing their husbands to escape
violence.
   Dean Foster, Gardner's deputy chief of staff, said Monday the
coalition's letter had not yet arrived at the governor's office.
   ``The governor takes his responsibilities regarding paroles,
clemency and pardons very seriously,'' Foster said. ``The Clemency
and Pardons Board reviews all requests and he considers the
recommendations. He will look at this request in the same way.''
   Gardner, a Democrat, has used his clemency powers only once
since taking office in 1984, and that was to commute the sentence
of a woman who said she had been battered.

   A military panel on Tuesday rejected appeals by
four Moslem fundamentalists seeking to avoid deportation. In the
occupied territories, troops fired at crowds of stone-throwing
Palestinians, wounding 15, Arab reports said.
   Eleven of those shot were young demonstrators in the Gaza Strip
town of Khan Yunis. Four Palestinians were shot in a clash with
soldiers in the Tulkarm refugee camp in the West Bank, the reports
said.
   The appeals board ruled that the four men from the occupied Gaza
Strip facing expulsion were key activists of Hamas, a Moslem
fundamentalist organization involved in the 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   The board gave them 48 hours to appeal to the Supreme Court, the
military command said. The Supreme Court rarely reverses such
decisions.
   The four were served with deportation orders on Dec. 15, the day
after Hamas, which means ``zeal'' in Arabic, claimed responsibility
for the stabbing deaths of three Israelis in Jaffa, a suburb of Tel
Aviv.
   The four are college instructor Fadel Khadel Zaabut, 34; civil
engineer Emad Khaled el Alami, 34; Mustafa Youssef Abdul el Lidawi,
26; and Mustafa Ahmed el Qnuih, 45.
   Israel has expelled 60 Arabs to neighboring Arab countries since
the uprising in Gaza and the West Bank began, claiming they
fomented violence.
   Western countries say deportations violate the Geneva
Convention.
   Eight of the 11 people shot in Khan Yunis were hit in the legs
and the other three in the chest or abdomen, including a
10-year-old boy who suffered a serious chest injury, Arab reports
said. The army confirmed the boy was wounded and was checking
reports that others were shot.
   In the Tulkarm camp, one of the four Palestinians wounded was a
13-year-old boy shot in the chest.
   The army command confirmed the injuries.
   The command also said Tuesday that under new military
regulations, to take effect Jan. 1, all male officers must carry
arms, even those in non-combat positions serving in pre-1967
Israel.
   The new orders followed a wave of attacks on civilians inside
Israel as the uprising against Israeli occupation spilled into Tel
Aviv this month.
   Officers serving in combat units already carry weapons, but only
non-combat officers living in the occupied territories captured in
the 1967 Middle East War had carried weapons under the old orders,
the army said.
   Israel army radio said the Jewish state's Broadcasting Authority
voted to remove Druse journalist Rafik Halaby from his editorial
post at state-run Israel TV Tuesday as a result of an article he
wrote on the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riot, in which at least 17
Palestinians were killed by police gunfire.
   Halaby will be moved out of the TV newsroom into a different
department, the radio said. It said the article indicated support
for the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation and harshly
criticized the government for the Temple Mount killings.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines charges that its pilots are
staging a sickout over stalled contract talks and have contributed
to flight cancellations, but the pilots' union denies there's any
organized protest.
   American management and the Allied Pilots Association have been
negotiating a revsed contract for 14 months, but have made little
headway.
   The increase in the number of pilots calling in sick, coupled
with bad weather, the holiday traffic crush and the airline's loss
of 230 pilots to Operation Desert Shield led to an unusually high
number of flight cancellations over the weekend, said American
spokesman Marty Heires.
   At its hub at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Sunday,
the carrier canceled 37 arriving and 37 departing flights,
amounting to about 9 percent of its flights.
   The Fort Worth-based carrier said the number of pilots calling
in sick over the weekend soared to record numbers, almost 70
percent higher than normal, airline officials said.
   ``It's all an attempt to compel the company to agree to terms
that the pilots would like us to on the contract,'' said Robert W.
Baker, American executive vice president for operations.
   Baker told The Dallas Morning News in Tuesday's editions that
529 of American's 9,000 pilots were on sick leave Monday and about
500 called in sick over the weekend.
   The typical pilot absentee rate is 250 during normal periods and
300 during Christmas holidays, said Heires.
   ``We have to assume there's some union activity here,'' Heires
said. ``Now, I don't know whether this was an organized effort or
whether some pilots are taking it upon themselves to do this.''
   Union officials denied any concerted effort was behind the
higher absentee rate, though for some time now they have been
urging pilots not to work if they are sick.
   ``I know there's nothing going on in terms of any grass-roots
operation or any other type of operation to call in sick or not
being available,'' said APA executive director Scott Peterson.
   Baker said the absentee rate for flight attendants is average.
   Both management and labor traded contract proposals in the past
month but remain far apart. Negotiations resume Jan. 7 in
Washington, D.C., under the auspices of the National Mediation
Board.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the existing contract will remain
in force until a federal mediator declares an impasse. After a
30-day cooling off period, the carrier may impose new conditions of
employment on the pilots and the union can strike.
   Employee sickouts are illegal under the Railway Labor Act.
   For several months, the union has been urging its members not to
push themselves into going to work if they are ill and not to
answer their phones if they don't want to work on their days off.
The union says that does not amount to a sickout.
   ``Although the company may be disappointed in that, there's
nothing illegal about it,'' said APA spokesman Tom Hunt. ``What's
the reason for that? I think it's low morale. There's no question
the pilots at American Airlines are extremely disgruntled with the
company, with management.''
   The APA is seeking to abolish the two-tier wage scale pilots
accepted in 1983, when the company was struggling financially. The
two-tier scale pays newly hired pilots at a lower scale than
existing crew members.
   In addition, union members want the company to bring newer
pilots up to parity in terms of pension and vacation time. The
pilots are also fighting the company's insistence that they
shoulder a greater share of their health care insurance costs.
   APA members also contend that American, as the largest airline
in the Western world and one of the most profitable, should pay its
pilots the highest wage of any U.S. airline.
   The company contends the APA's contract demands will force it to
scale back its five-year, $20.9 billion expansion plan.

<TEXT>
   The Suriname army chief who led a
bloodless Christmas Eve coup pledged Tuesday to relinquish power to
an elected government within 100 days and denied an ousted dictator
was behind the coup.
   ``The army is not bent on having and keeping power,'' Cmdr. Ivan
Graanoogst said on state-run radio, a day after he and other
officers overthrew the elected, 3-year-old government of President
Ramsewak Shankar.
   The military removed Shankar and his Cabinet while they met at
the presidential palace Monday evening, as many Surinamese were
attending Christmas Mass.
   The coup will ``give the Surinamese society a chance to choose a
better government that can give content to a credible democratic
structure,'' Graanoogst said in an interview with Dutch television.
   No one was injured or arrestd in the coup and the army is
allowing the ousted president and his ministers complete freedom of
movement, Shankar said in an interview from his home.
   ``I'm free to go wherever I want to,'' he said.
   The coup was seen as the culmination of a conflict between
Shankar and Desi Bouterse, dictator of Suriname from 1980 until
1988. Shankar took office that year after defeating a candidate
backed by Bouterse. Despite the defeat of his candidate, Bouterse
stayed on as army chief.
   The Dutch and U.S. governments denounced the coup. The Dutch,
the former colonial rulers of the nation of 400,000 people, said
they were cutting aid to the government.
   Normal holiday activity resumed in the capital, Paramaribo, on
Tuesday. People flocked to churches for Christmas services and
there was no unusual military presence on the streets.
   International telephone service was restored Tuesday afternoon
after being cut Monday night shortly after the coup.
   ``Everything is completely normal, as if nothing has happened,''
said a Surinamese journalist, who asked not to be further
identified for security reasons. ``Life in the country goes on.''
   Graanoogst said Paramaribo's international airport and two
smaller airports remained open and there would be no curfew because
``there is no danger whatsoever.''
   The coup occurred at 11 p.m. Monday, as Shankar and his Cabinet
held an emergency meeting to discuss Bouterse's announcement
earlier in the day that he was resigning because of differences
with Shankar, whom he called a ``joker.''
   A high-ranking government source said the military told Shankar
it was assuming control and asked the president and his Cabinet to
leave the presidential palace. They decided to do so to avoid
bloodshed, the source said.
   Later Monday night, Graanoogst appeared in uniform on state
television to announce the coup.
   The latest conflict between Shankar and Bouterse had been
brewing since Saturday, when Bouterse returned from a trip to Ghana
and Switzerland. On three separate occasions this month, Dutch
officials refused to give Bouterse a visa or allow him to speak to
reporters after he landed at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
   Dutch officials cited security reasons; Bouterse claimed Shankar
collaborated with the Dutch to humiliate him.
   ``If I had been in Shankar's place I would have turned Schiphol
upside down to protect the dignity of the commander of my country's
national army,'' Bouterse said.
   The two men also have been at odds over the government's attempt
to negotiate a settlement of an armed revolt led by Bouterse's
former bodyguard, Ronny Brunswijk, on behalf of the nation's Bush
Negro minority. The jungle war began in July 1986.
   Suriname is a jungle-laden, Georgia-sized country with few roads
and poor communications. Its population is a multiracial mosaic of
Indian and Javanese immigrants, Bush Negroes and indigenous tribes.
   Bouterse opposes a tentative peace agreement reached with
Brunswijk on the grounds that it failed to disarm the insurgents
and left them in control of the interior of Suriname.
   Also, some Surinamese have been urging the government to bring
charges against Bouterse and others for the 1982 massacre of 15
opposition politicians. The government had never said whether it
plans to do anything about the atrocity.
   Because of Bouterse's resignation Monday, Graanoogst, head of
the nation's military police and one of four military commanders,
acted as nominal head of the new military regime.
   Bouterse was believed to be the mastermind of the coup. But
Graanoogst claimed ``the former commander-in-chief, Desi Bouterse,
was not at all involved.''
   ``Bouterse is at home, and like a real Surinamese, he offers his
input when necessary,'' said Graanoogst, who went on to describe
Bouterse as a ``man who has shown in the last ten years that his
heart is in the right place.''
   Graanoogst promised to set up an interim cabinet that would
organize free national elections within 100 days, but refused to
speculate on who would be appointed as the country's leader in the
meantime.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said
it did not appear U.S. citizens in Suriname were in danger. The
department called for the restoration of the civilian government.
   ``We condemn this violation of constitutional order in
Suriname...We call on the Surinamese military to restore power
immediately to the democratically elected authorities of that
country,'' Ms. McCarty said.
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it ``sharply condemns the
undemocratic seizure of power by the Surinamese Army.''
   Bouterse led a military coup in 1980 that toppled an elected
government. He allowed elections in November 1987 in which
Shankar's three-party coalition, the Front for Democracy and
Development, easily defeated the military-backed National Democracy
Party.
   When Shankar began his scheduled five-year term on Jan. 25,
1988, Bouterse continued to wield considerable influence as the
country's military chief.
   Suriname was among the most prosperous countries in South
America before the 1980 coup.
   Since then its economy has declined, due to a cut in Dutch aid,
a drop in the price of bauxite, the main export, and the guerrilla
warfare that curtailed bauxite and aluminum production.
   When Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975,
the Dutch government pledged a developmental aid package amounting
to $100 million annually over 15 years.
   The aid was suspended after the 1982 massacre of the
politicians, whom Bouterse claimed were planning a coup.
   A relatively small amount of humanitarian aid was resumed
recently to Shankar's government.

<HEAD>Albania's Democratic Party Holds Rally Outside Capital</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto XTIR2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania's newly formed opposition
Democratic Party drew more than 5,000 excited supporters to its
first rally outside the capital Tuesday.
   The crowd gathered in the central square of Kavaje, 20 miles
west of Tirana, shouting ``Freedom! Democracy!'' and raising their
hands in victory signs as leaders of the new party addressed them.
   An Associated Press photographer at the rally reported by
telephone that the crowd of mostly young people literally jumped
around in excitement and nearly toppled the rostrum when party
leader Sali Berisha stood to speak.
   Albania officials legalized the party less than two weeks ago,
after student protests led to widespread demands for democracy
throughout Europe's last stronghold of hard-line Communism.
   On Monday, the government refused to postpone Feb. 10
legislative elections. The opposition had asked for the voting to
be held in May to allow it more time to prepare an effective
campaign.
   The Communists, in power since 1944, control every sphere of
public life, including national news media. The Democratic Party
has received permission to publish its own newspaper but lacks
funds and equipment.
   Official media have said little about the new party, meaning it
must spread its program around Albania by word-of-mouth or at
rallies similar to Tuesday's at Kavaje.
   Kavaje, a town of 25,000, was a center of protest against
Communist policies in mid-December along with northern city of
Shkodra, the port of Durres and the central city of Elbasan.
   Sihat Tozaj, secretary of the parliamentary presidium, said the
government refused to delay the voting because a new parliament was
needed urgently to adopt constitutional changes and reform laws,
the state news agency ATA reported.
   The reforms are to include opening up Albania's isolated
economy, now on the brink of collapse; removal of restrictions on
religion, and bringing human rights standards up to ``world
standards,'' ATA quoted Tozaj as saying.
   The governing Albanian Labor (Communist) Party was to discuss
the planned reforms at a national party conference Wednesday in
Tirana.
   Albania's president and Communist party leader, Ramiz Alia,
began implementing some cautious reforms this year in an attempt to
edge the small Balkan nation of 3.2 million out of decades of
self-imposed isolation.

   A small explosion outside a concert hall near St.
Peter's Square shattered the windows of a USO club early Tuesday
but caused no injuries, officials said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said late Tuesday night it received
a telephone call from a man speaking Italian who said, ``We are the
anarchists who exploded the bomb against Vatican Radio.''
   The man claimed Vatican Radio was targeted because ``they
traffic in ideological drugs,'' an ANSA editor said.
   He said the caller described the bomb in such a way that police
were taking the claim seriously.
   ANSA earlier quoted bomb experts as saying the device appeared
to have been made of gunpowder wrapped in firecracker paper.
   An employee of Vatican Radio, whose studios are in a nearby
building, said the explosion occurred near a side entrance of the
Santa Cecilia concert auditorium. He said Vatican Radio suffered no
damage.
   In April 1988, a car bomb exploded outside a crowded United
Service Organizations club in Naples, killing five people,
including an American servicewoman. Two Japanese terrorists were
indicted in that attack, which came on the second anniversary of
the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   Tom Skipper, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Tuesday's blast
apparently occurred between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. The concert hall's
main entrance, as well as the entrance to the USO club, is along
Via della Conciliazione, which leads from near the Tiber River to
St. Peter's Square.
   The USO entertains and otherwise aids U.S. service personnel.

   Volunteers warmed the lives of the sick, poor and homeless
Tuesday as Christmas gave Americans a merry break from
wallet-watching and war wariness.
   ``I cannot change the world, but I know for a fact I can make a
difference,'' said Iqbal Emamudeen of Orange, N.J. A publicist for
a chain of drug stores, he was among about 135 volunteers serving
Christmas lunch for hundreds of homeless and needy people at a
church agency in downtown Newark.
   Volunteers led by civil rights veteran Hosea Williams fed an
estimated 30,000 people in Atlanta. In New York, 1,500 people ate
stuffing, sweet potatoes, succotash and pies at a hotel as
fourth-and fifth-graders sang carols.
   Impoverished thousands were served a traditional holiday feast
at Los Angeles' Skid Row while jail inmates nearby were blessed
during a dawn Mass celebrated by Archbishop Roger Mahony.
   In the Christmas spirit of giving, a Santa in Kansas City, Mo.,
donated blood. Singer James Brown offered soul for soldiers whose
holiday leaves were canceled. Adoptive parents in Texas gave their
hearts to two infants rescued from the squalor of a Romanian
orphanage.
   Americans around the Great Lakes enjoyed a white Christmas, but
retailers were blue and the holiday left some newly jobless
Americans in the red.
   Some merchants reported a last-minute surge of gift-buying by
consumers who had seemed intent on cutting back spending. But
receipts were not expected to make up for disappointing early
sales.
   ``It's not going to be anything that's going to excite
anybody,'' said Kenneth Macke, chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp.
   Some charitable organizations in the Northeast blame the
economic downturn and government cutbacks for a doubling in the
demand for services. But in New Hampshire, food bank organizers
said charity was keeping pace.
   ``The donations have picked up tremendously,'' said Thomas
Murphy, volunteer administrator of the Monadnock Area Food Bank in
Peterborough, N.H.
   Ham radio operators donated their time to connect sailors and
Marines on ships in the Middle East with their families. Guy Titman
of Charlotte, N.C., said he had made about 70 connections by noon.
   ``Most of the conversations are: `Merry Christmas. We miss you.
We love you,''' he said.
   Xavier Fernandes opted for a more humorous greeting to his son
Roman, a Marine corporal in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I know it's rough over there,'' Fernandes said on a TV
satellite hookup from a Boston hotel. ``But look at it this way -
at least you don't have to see the Patriots' games over here.'' The
New England Patriots are 1-14, the National Football League's worst
record.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin and the Rev. Jesse Jackson held
separate Christmas services for prisoners at Chicago's Cook County
Jail.
   The Rev. Tyrone Crider of Operation PUSH, who joined Jackson,
told inmates in the jail's gymnasium about the best gift they could
receive.
   ``It fits all sizes; it doesn't go out of style and best of all,
God's gift comes with all accessories included in his son Jesus
Christ.''
   James Brown, the singer serving a prison term in South Carolina
for assault, was allowed to give his first public performance in
two years, a benefit for 4,000 soldiers at Fort Jackson, S.C.
   Brown sang four songs for the troops, shouting ``Merry
Christmas'' between numbers. He wrapped up the set with ``God Bless
America'' as trainees in crew cuts clapped and cheered.
   The Florida Baptist Ministries sent turkeys to the 28 hungry
crewmen of the Itapage, a Brazilian ship stranded in Jacksonville
since federal marshals seized it for debts on Dec. 3.
   Stacey and Ben Disney of Dublin, Texas, gave their 11-month-old
son and 7-month-old daughter a gift they may not appreciate for
several years - a scrapbook detailing how their adoption rescued
them from the squalor of a Romanian orphanage.
   Ray Shick, dressed as St. Nick, arrived Christmas Eve at the
Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City. Instead of passing
out toys, Santa gave his 50th pint of blood.
   American Ice owner Robert Pierce donated three tons of shaved
ice to make snow on the lawn of Elaine Riddle, of Dallas, who has
lymphatic cancer.
   ``I told my friend Kathy that if I had one last Christmas, I
wanted it to be a white one,'' Ms. Riddle said. ``I'm 41 years old,
and I've never had a white Christmas - until today,'' she said.
   Weather across the nation was more arctic than scenic, but
lights twinkled through freezing rain and sleet.
   Nancy Cole of Lewisburg, Tenn., vowed not to take down her
decorations until her husband, National Guard Sgt. William Ray
Cole, comes home from Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm going to buy him a gift a week till he gets back home,''
Mrs. Cole said. ``I hope he's not gone too long.''

   A Christmas Day fire that may have been
ignited by a smoldering cigarette killed five people, including two
children, police said.
   Arson experts helped investigate, but fire Capt. Bruce Sutton
said firefighters ``have no reason to believe it was anything but
an accident.''
   ``We believe it was caused by a smoldering cigarette, but we
took all kinds of samples from the house and have sent them to the
lab,'' Sutton said. He said it would be at least Thursday before
the lab report was completed.
   The early morning fire apparently started at the end of a couch
on the first floor of the 2{-story brick house, and caused $30,000
damage, he said.
   A visitor to the home, Todd Allen Qualls, 29, of Columbus, said
he awakened to the smell of smoke and escaped through a window,
cutting his bare feet on glass. He said he climbed down a ladder
put up by firefighters.
   ``It all happened so fast, I don't really know what happened,''
Qualls said.
   Family members said the victims were India Hamrick, 25; Ronina
Hamrick, 30; Gerald Givens, 39; Rashawn Hamrick, 4; and Natasha
Hamrick, 10, all of whom lived in the house that burned.
   India and Ronina Hamrick were sisters, Ronina was the mother of
the two children, and Givens was the former husband of India and
Ronina Hamrick's mother, according to India and Ronina's brother,
Greg Hamrick, and their aunt, Jeane Bell.
   One firefighter was injured slightly.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, declaring
America the source of all evil in the Mideast, reiterated his claim
that Kuwait is part of Iraq and said Tuesday that Palestine, not
Kuwait, needed to be ``liberated.''
   Speaking only 21 days before the U.N. deadline for his troops to
leave Kuwait, Saddam suggested to visiting Jordanian politicians he
wouldn't leave Kuwait until Israel withdrew from the occupied
territories.
   ``Let all the fleets and Israel hear, Palestine comes first and
it must be liberated,'' Saddam said in a speech broadcast on Iraqi
state radio.
   The Iraqi president also repeated his claim that Kuwait was
unjustly removed from Baghdad's rule by British colonial rulers.
   He challenged the United States, Britain, and other forces
massing in the Persian Gulf region to put the question of Kuwait's
future to an Arab referendum:
   ``If you brought your fleets because of this issue, how can you
help the people in Kuwait have their say in a democratic manner?
...
   ``Why do they not hold a referendum to see the inclination of
the majority of the Arab people, if they are truly democratic?''
Saddam said.
   He denounced ``the United States and its allies on the
international level; that is, all elements of evil, hatred, and
deviation, as well as its agents in the Arab homeland.''
   That was evidently a reference to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria,
Morocco and other Arab nations among the U.S.-dominated
multinational force of some 400,000 troops preparing for the Jan.
15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal.
   The U.N. Security Council have given Baghdad until that date to
unconditionally pull out of Kuwait, which it conquered on Aug. 2,
and restore the government of the emir of Kuwait.
   After Jan. 15, the Security Council said, the allies of Kuwait's
government-in-exile may use any means necessary, including military
force, to liberate the emirate.

   Homicide didn't take a holiday in the nation's
largest city as eight people were killed in as many hours Christmas
Eve and morning.
   The victims included a mother who died after she allegedly was
punched in the face by her son at a holiday gathering, a man who
was fatally shot as he carried holiday packages to his home, and a
toddler whose mother was charged with homicide, police said
Tuesday.
   Maria Martinez, 67, died at a local hospital after her son,
Heriberto Altreche, 37, allegedly hit her during a family
get-together in the Bronx Monday night, police Sgt. Tina Mohrmann
said. The medical examiner was to determine if the punch caused her
death, Mohrmann said.
   The toddler, 20-month-old Belinda Jackson, died Monday night at
the Bronx hospital where she was brought suffering from apparant
multiple trauma. The mother, Ruby Jackson, was charged with
homicide and her other five children were turned over to child
welfare authorities.
   Andre Rodriguez, 18, was fatally shot Monday night as he fled
two men who began shooting at him while he stood on a street corner
near his home in the Bronx, Mohrmann said.
   Another pair of men, armed with shotguns, confronted Berhane
Waldermarian, 31, in fron of his Queens home and announced a
robbery. Waldermarian, who was carrying holiday gifts, put his
packages down on the sidewalk. The gunmen shot him once in the
stomach and fled empty-handed. Waldermarian's parents, wife and
children were inside the house.
   Waldermarian was taken to a hospital, where he died Tuesday
morning. Anthony Mack, 18, and Vernon Ricks, 24, both of Queens,
were charged with second-degree murder in Waldermarian's death,
said Sgt. Mary Wrensen, a police spokeswoman.
   The body of a man who had been shot in the head was found
slumped over the steering wheel of a car in Brooklyn Monday
evening.
   Elsewhere in Brooklyn, a Christmas Eve shopper shot and killed
one man and critically injured a second who were trying to rob a
furniture store and its patrons. None of the customers or employees
was injured.
   An unidentified 34-year-old was shot and killed early Tuesday
after he got involved in a dispute at a Bronx Christmas party. A
28-year-old man standing nearby was wounded from a shot in the
chest, Mohrmann said.
   Also on Tuesday morning, police found the body of a man,
apparently in his mid-20s, who had been shot in the back and
buttocks and left on a Brooklyn street, Mohrmann said. The man was
shot during an apparent robbery.

<TEXT>
   Two prison parolees charged with fatally
shooting two women and trying to kill a man at a remote mountain
cabin had kidnapped the man's daughters to use as shields if
confronted by police, court records said.
   The killings and kidnappings occurred Saturday when a family
from Humble, Texas, surprised two men apparently burglarzing the
cabin where they were to spend the holidays, authorities said.
   The cabin is in the Summit Count community of Oakley and is only
reachable by snowmobile.
   The men, Von Lester Taylor, 25, and Edward Steven Deli, 21, were
arraigned Monday before 3rd Circuit Judge Floyd Gowans on two
counts each of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
   They also were charged with one count each of attempted
first-degree murder, aggravated arson, theft, aggravated assault,
aggravated robbery and failure to respond to an officer's signal to
stop.
   Both were held without bail in Summit County Jail pending a Jan.
8 preliminary hearing.
   Kaye Tidwell Tiede, 51, and her mother, Beth Harmon Tidwell
Potts, who was in her mid-70s, were shot by two men who confronted
them when they arrived at the cabin Saturday. Mrs. Tiede's
daughter, Linae, 20, was tied up.
   Mrs. Tiede's husband, Rolf, was shot and wounded when he and
their daughter Tricia, 16, arrived at the cabin several hours
later. He was released from University Hospital on Monday.
   The men took Tricia and Linae Tiede to use as shields in case
police confronted them, court documents said. The sisters were
unharmed.
   Before leaving, the men poured snowmobile fuel throughout the
two-story cabin and started a fire that caused substantial damage
to the upper floor.
   The men forced the sisters onto snowmobiles and they traveled
about two miles to the Tiede family car.
   The four got into the car, and were spotted by authorities on a
nearby highway soon afterward. The men surrendered after a police
chase that reached speeds of up to 100 mph.
   Deli and Taylor left a Salt Lake City halfway house on Dec. 14
to look for jobs and never returned.
   Taylor was paroled to the Community Corrections Center on Oct.
23 after serving a sentence for aggravated burglary, a state
corrections spokesman said. Deli was convicted of aggravated arson
and was paroled to the halfway house on Nov. 27.

   Santa Claus got a parking ticket while delivering
toys, jackets and food to needy families, and he says he may go to
court over the $150 he had to pay to retrieve his ``sleigh.''
   Larry Longfelder, a lawyer and president of the Forgotten
Childrens' Fund, said he didn't know he was in an apartment
manager's reserved space when he stopped at an apartment building
dressed as Santa on Christmas Eve.
   Within 10 minutes, he said, the car's wheels had been locked to
a barrel by an employee of the Community Police Traffic and Parking
Enforcement Agency.
   ``Just because it's Santa Claus doesn't mean he can park
anywhere,'' said a supervisor for the private agency, who
instructed an employee to insist on the $150 fee before releasing
the vehicle. The supervisor refused to give his name.
   Longfelder said the agency refused to accept a check or credit
card, so he had to walk to an automatic teller machine and withdraw
$150 before continuing his rounds.
   ``It's crazy to do this to Santa,'' he said.

   A fire that killed a man and six of his
nine children probably started when a light bulb on the Christmas
tree overheated and sparked, a relative said.
   Initial reports from fire investigators said the tree fell over,
broke a bulb and started the blaze. But John Dell'Orco said Monday
the tree had been tied to the ceiling and couldn't have fallen
over.
   Dell'Orco is the brother of Martin Dell'Orco, 38, who died in
the Saturday fire along with his children Bonnie, 11; Sara, 9;
Katie, 8; Megan and Michaelboth 5, and Robert, 4.
   Martin Dell'Orco's wife, Debbie, 36, had bought new Christmas
lights for the tree and had noticed one of the bulbs was hot before
she decorated the tree, John Dell'Orco said. But she and her
husband dismissed it, he said.
   More than $20,000 has been donated to the Dell'Orcos from across
the country, said Canton Township Sgt. Eddie Tanner. Apartments,
clothing, food and funeral services also have been offered to the
survivors.

   Security forces arrested 31 radical
students and charged them with conspiring with North Korea to
overthrow the government, the national intelligence agency said
Wednesday.
   More than 70 other members of an undeground group called
Chamintong are on a wanted list, the National Security Planning
agency said. Chamintong means independence, democracy and
unification.
   The agency said in a news release that Chamintong's goal was to
form a unfified Korea by 1995 under North Korean leader Kim Il
Sung's leadership, if necessary through an armed uprising in the
South.
   The agency said that the 31 students were core members of
Chamintong, which it said was formed in 1988 with guidance from a
clandestine North Korean propaganda agency.
   Chamintong manipulated Chondaehyop, a dissident student
alliance, to stage anti-government and anti-American activities in
the name of seeking democratization, the news release said.
   Chondaehyop has been involved in sometimes violent
demonstrations demanding the pullout of American troops and
overthrow of the Seoul regime in favor of unification with the
North.
   The 31 arrested students included Chondaehyop chairman Song
Kap-suk, 24, a senior at Chonanm Unviersity in Kwangju, who was
arrested in October. The agency did not say when the others were
arrested.
   The agency said Chamintong members were obliged to pledge
allegiance to Kim Il Sung and sing songs praising Kim's exploits
fighting Japanese colonial rule, the agency said. Japan colonized
Korea from 1910 through World War II.
   The peninsula was divided following the war and since the Korean
War has been split into the staunchly Communist North, ruled by
Kim, and the free market-oriented South, dominated by the military
with increasingly democratic rule.
   The prime ministers of the Koreas have held three rounds of
talks since September to ease hostilities and improve communication
between their countries, but they have failed to make any tangible
progress.

   Security forces arrested 31 radical
students and charged them with conspiring with North Korea to
overthrow the government, the national intelligence agency said
Wednesday.
   More than 70 other members of an undeground group called
Chamintong are on a wanted list, the National Security Planning
agency said. Chamintong is a Korean acronym for independence,
democracy and unification.
   The agency said in a news release that Chamintong's goal was to
form a unfified Korea by 1995 under North Korean leader Kim Il
Sung's leadership, if necessary through an armed uprising in the
South.
   The agency said that the 31 students were core members of

War has been split into the staunchly Communist North, ruled by
Kim, and the free market-oriented South, dominated by the military
with increasingly democratic rule.
   North Korea has sharply criticized the South for arresting
dissidents and radical students who have made contact with or
visited the North. South Korean authorities have sought to limit
the dialogue between the countries to official talks among the
countries' leaders.
   The prime ministers of the Koreas have held three rounds of
talks since September to ease hostilities and improve communication
between their countries, but they have failed to make any tangible
progress.

   Soldiers and cautious
visitors wandered through nearly deserted streets as fear of
violence left Bethlehem with one of its smallest Christmas crowds
in recent memory.
   ``For us, Christmas is an event of peace, and here you cannot
feel peace,''said German tourist Gabriele Beitz in Manger Square,
near the grotto where tradition holds that Christ was born.
   The Christmas mood elsewhere in the Middle East was also anxious
as U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf were placed on a heightened
state of alert to guard against terrorist attacks.
   But soldiers still managed to mark the holiday with carols,
decorations and desert religious services.

   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - The worst freeze since 1937 devastated
California's navel orange crop, sending growers into Christmas with
little hope of salvaging the season's harvest.
   ``This is way worse than I've ever seen,'' Bakersfield-area
grower John Slikker Jr. said Monday. ``Yesterday, we cut these
oranges in half. ... It was just like cutting through a Popsicle.''
   The weekend Arctic blast also damaged nursery plants, lemons and
avocados and destroyed most early Southern California strawberries,
agriculture officials said. Crop damage was put in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Cliff Holland of California Citrus Mutual, a growers
organization, admitted the string of freezing nights probably
destroyed the state's 1990-91 navel orange harvest.

   NEW YORK (AP) - When all the receipts are tallied, Christmas
sales are likely to be unchanged or barely above last year, a poor
season for retailers who couldn't overcome consumer worries over
the economy and Middle East.
   Shopping traffic was slow at many stores and malls this season
and consumers who did shop bought selectively. High-profile
retailing companies around the country complained Monday their
sales were a disappointment.
   Sales that are unchanged or barely higher are considered poor,
because after the rate of inflation is subtracted, a store's
business may be down from year-earlier levels. Consumer prices rose
6.4 percent through the first 11 months of this year, meaning many
stores' modest gains were wiped out.
   ``It has not been a disaster, but it has been a pretty flat
season,'' said Suzanne McMillan, senior vice president for
marketing at Saks Fifth Avenue.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rock musicians who once were anti-war
activists are adding a sophisticated twist to their efforts of the
1960s to help defend the environment today.
   ``We have been around long enough to learn how to use the
system,'' said Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. ``We have contacts in
government.''
   Paul McCartney joined forces with the environmental group
Friends of the Earth during his 1990 world tour, collecting
signatures on large petitions at concerts and lining them up for
efforts on Capitol Hill.
   Weir, John Oates of the band Hall &amp; Oates and songwriter-singer
Carole King have taken an active role in the Alliance for the Wild
Rockies, a group opposing deforestation in the Rocky Mountains and
Pacific Northwest.

<HEAD>Bush Lends Presidential Clout To The A-Word</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Note language which quotes Bush warning that Saddam Hussein
will ``get his ass kicked'' in military confrontation, and earlier
Bush and Carter use of similar terms</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the barracks or the locker room, nobody
thinks twice about threatening to whip, kick or otherwise manhandle
the opposition's rear end. It's different when presidents get down
and graphic.
   That may make it an effective way to turn up the volume when the
man in the White House doesn't think somebody is paying attention.
As in President Bush's holiday message to Saddam Hussein:
   ``If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass
kicked.''
   There are certain amenities about the purposeful, presidential
use of such terminology for public consumption.
   It's not done on tape or on camera, except inadvertently. Better
to have it relayed second hand, leaving just a little room for
doubt that a leader so eminent would talk that way.
   And it can't be done often or it would become too ordinary to
attract attention.
   Besides, there's always a risk of a backlash. A former governor
of Massachusetts, Francis W. Sargent, once used the A-word at a
governors conference, and said his mother called to tell him she
was going to wash his mouth out with soap.
   Then again, it's hardly an X-rated term. And it is right there
in the dictionary: ``Ass: (vulgar slang) the buttocks.'' Bush's
latest usage was widely quoted on radio and television, and in
print.
   After Bush met with a group of congressmen on Dec. 20, Rep.
Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., said the president had told them that he
doesn't think Saddam Hussein understands that there really will be
war if he doesn't get out of Kuwait.
   ``The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed
confrontation is to make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really
aware that, to quote him, that `If we get into an armed situation,
he's going to get his ass kicked','' Gallegly said.
   While others confirmed the remark, Bush was circumspect. Asked
later whether it was an accurate quotation, the president arched
his eyebrows and said nothing.
   He'd been more forthcoming after accidentally putting a similar
observation on the record during the 1984 campaign, when he was
vice president. ``We tried to kick a little ass last night,'' he
said after a campaign debate with Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro, his
Democratic opponent. Bush made the comment while shaking hands with
dockworkers at a campaign rally in New Jersey, unaware that there
was a boom microphone close enough to pick up his words.
   Later on, he said he wasn't apologizing. ``I stand behind it. I
use it all the time. My kids use it, everybody who competes in
sports uses it.''
   Ronald Reagan expressed some doubt about the campaign comment,
saying he wasn't inclined to believe his vice president had said
it.
   Reagan himself didn't go beyond ``keister,'' which is slang for
``rump.''
   In 1983, irked that information about his budget and other White
House business was finding its way into print, Reagan ordered a
crackdown. ``I've had it up to my keister with these leaks,'' he
told his staff.
   No such gentler euphemism would do for Jimmy Carter when Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy was preparing to challenge him for the 1980
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass,'' Carter said at a White
House dinner with Democratic congressmen.
   ``I was startled,'' said then-Rep. William M. Brodhead, D-Mich.
``I thought my ears were deceiving me. I said, `Excuse me, Mr.
President, what did you say?' And Carter replied, `If Kennedy runs,
I'll whip his ass.' ''
   He did and Carter did. But strong words aren't enough. Reagan
won the White House.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the yen and stock prices
fell in sluggish trading in Tokyo Tuesday amid concerns about the
Middle East and political problems in the Soviet Union.
   The dollar closed at 135.95 yen, up 0.25 yen from Friday's close
of 135.70 yen. Financial markets were closed on Monday for a
national holiday.
   After oening at 135.95 yen, the dollar ranged from 135.90 yen
to 136.25 yen. Trading was quiet at $2.28 billion in spot
transactions, down from $12.351 billion on Friday. The dollar has
now gained 2.92 yen in four trading days.
   Market players were beginning to pay more attention to
international politics than to interest rate shifts, said Tomoko
Hirai, a dealer at Citibank.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate last week,
a move that is generally associated with the weaker dollar.
   But anxieties about the future of the Soviet Union following
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation announcement
last week and the continuing tensions in the Middle East have been
putting upward pressures on the dollar, dealers noted.
   Investors tend to buy the dollar as a safe haven in times of
international uncertainty.
   ``The dollar is stable now, but there is a technical resistance
point to its rise at 136.30 yen,'' said Hirai.
   On the stock exchange, the stronger dollar, lower bond prices
and worries about the Persian Gulf and the Soviet Union helped push
the Nikkei average lower, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 23,767.88 points,
down 351.72 points or 1.46 percent from Friday's close. Volume on
the first section was estimated at a slim 210 million shares, down
from 350.621 million Friday.
   The Nikkei average has now shed 1,108.90 points in three trading
days.
   The absence of foreign investors slowed down trading, said a
dealer at a Tokyo-based securities firm.
   Financial markets were closed overseas today for Christmas.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.36 points from Friday's
87.78-point close. Their yield rose to 7.210 percent from 7.115
percent.

   If the crisis in the Persian Gulf heats up,
would U.S. securities and futures markets melt down?
   Probably not, say most market professionals, although they
disagree on just how sharp a backlash there would be on exchange
floors and trading pits.
   ``If you had the outbreak of a sudden, major shooting war in the
Middle East, I suspect that short-term, the market would go into a
freefall but I also wouldn't be surprised at all if it closed
higher two or three days later,'' said Robert Kirby, chairman of
Capital Guardian Trust Co. in Los Angeles.
   Yale Hirsch, a market tracker who produces the Stock Trader's
Almanac, predicts ``if there's no shooting war or drawn-out
impasse, we expect the Dow (Jones industrial average) to break
through 3,000 in 1991.''
   But if the crisis ends badly, the average, a key stock market
indicator, could sink to 2,000 next year, he said.
   Federal regulators say they have contingency plans to head off
panic in the markets - but what those plans are, they're not
saying.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the
stock, bond and mutual fund markets, says it has developed plans
for emergencies and has been in contact with the exchanges.
   ``But we don't discuss specific situations or specific
contingency plans,'' said Brandon Becker, associate director of the
SEC's Market Regulation Division.
   Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, who oversees futures markets for key commodities such
as oil, has said the CFTC and other agencies have plans for dealing
with market disruptions. But she also would not elaborate.
   A CFTC insider said officials have plans to get in touch with
the exchanges to coordinate information among the various markets.
   But ``do we have a plan so that if X happens we'll do this? No.
Because I think whatever X we put down, or Y or Z, there'd be Q, R
and S on top of that. We don't have a plan in that sense and we
just don't think we can,'' said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The big question is whether the markets' reaction to bad news
from the Gulf would be severe enough to force the exchanges or
regulators to shut them down.
   CFTC Commissioner William Albrecht has said a market closing
would be ``the last thing you really want to do'' because of the
need to determine prices and keep trading flowing.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has said it would stop trading
stock index futures, futures contracts based on a range of stocks,
if the New York Stock Exchange closed in the event of war.
   However, the NYSE also isn't revealing its hand.
   ``I'm not going to say there's a plan in place or not in place
until you know what's been presented to you,'' said Richard
Torrenzano, an NYSE spokesman.
   Even officials at the Merc decline to discuss the issue on the
record, saying they didn't want to speculate on what they might do.
   NYSE officials point to a series of ``circuit-breakers'' created
since the 1987 stock market crash that would slow down forms of
computerized program trading - often blamed for worsening stock
market volatility or temporarily halt trading if the market plunged
or skyrocketed 250 or more points.
   Should there be a surge in buying, selling or volume ``these
circuit breakers would serve to slow the market down and give
everyone a chance to assess what has taken place and make an
investment decision,'' said Torrenzano.
   Kirby, the Capital Guardian Trust chief and a member of the
commission appointed by President Reagan to investigate the 1987
stock market crash, said a market halt ``is the only fair way to
handle this kind of situation.''
   But market shutdowns, except for the occasional power outage in
New York or Chicago, are rare.
   The NYSE shut down at the beginning of World War I, from July 31
to Nov. 28, 1914. That was largely because of fears that
gold-hungry Europe would sell its securities in New York and take
gold home, sparking a possible economic collapse in this country,
said stock market historian Robert Sobel of Hofstra University.
   The New York markets also shut for V-J Day at the end of World
War II and after President Kennedy was assassinated.
   Sobel doesn't think there would be a panic if war broke out in
the Gulf because ``this is an event that we can look ahead and
think about. When it happens, people have plans all ready.''
   By contrast, he said, the crash of 1987, when the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged more than 500 points, ``caught a lot of
people unaware..''
   ``It's the ones that catch you unaware that cause panics,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Five Years After Big Bang, London Market Short of Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly five years after the ``Big Bang''
deregulation of Britain's financial markets, experts say London's
pioneering electronic stock market isn't living up to its
potential.
   Deregulation was supposed to sweep away London's clubby cartel
of stock dealers and create a fast, accessible and bigger
electronic market of the future. But critics say there aren't
enough stock dealers, trading is too expensive and small
shareholders are losing out.
   ``London's potential is very, very good,'' said Michael Selby,
who teaches finance at the London School of Economics. ``(But) it's
not happening yet.''
   The Stock Exchange concedes that some criticisms against the
system are valid and it is seeking to address them.
   The Big Bang brought in an electronic automated quotations
system that moved trading off the exchange floor and onto
securities firms' trading floors. It also opened the securities
business to commercial banks and foreign firms.
   Deregulation allowed more firms to become market makers, who buy
and sell shares from their own inventory. Market makers are
required to quote prices on the electronic system continuously;
buyers and sellers look for the best prices.
   London's market is based on the United States' NASDAQ electronic
over-the-counter system, which began operating in 1971.
   By comparison, the New York Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and most of the world's other stock markets are
centralized marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet on a trading
floor and agree on a price.
   London's system provides continuous trading and liquidity - or
plenty of stock to buy and sell - while the other markets can break
down under a flood of sell orders, its proponents say. That
contention isn't entirely supported by the facts.
   During the 1987 stock market crash, London's exchange stayed
open, while many other European exchanges buckled under selling
pressure. But in the United States, the New York Stock Exchange
never closed, which its supporters say saved the world financial
system from a meltdown. Meanwhile, many U.S. electronic traders
simply abandoned their posts.
   Since many firms now are owned by publicly-held banks, much more
is disclosed about what goes on in the once-secretive London
securities industry, and regulation has much improved, said Robin
Hutton, director-general of the British Merchant Banking and
Securities Houses Association.
   But there are still problems and complaints.
   Volume on the exchange shrank to 130 billion shares in 1989 from
150 billion in 1987. Part of the decline is due to a slump in
equity trading since the stock market crash that has hindered
profits at many firms.
   One complaint about London is that there aren't enough market
makers in each stock to avoid a cartel. And many small stocks don't
have market makers, makeing it difficult to trade those shares.
   London has 23 equity market makers, down from a post-Bang peak
of 33, but still more than the pre-deregulation 17. More than 200
of the exchange's over 2,000 domestic stocks had just one or no
market makers in September.
   Another criticism is that some market makers allegedly avoid
trading when the market is falling sharply by refusing to answer
their phones or taking them off the hook - precisely what happened
during the 1987 crash in the United States.
   Market makers say that if investors can't get through, it's
because traders are busy. The firms are running leanly and can't
afford to keep extra traders, they say.
   Critics also said London's spreads between the buying and
selling prices are too wide. The average spread for primary stocks
in September was 2.43 percent, compared with a pre-crash average of
1.22 percent.
   The large spread results from London's relatively high trading
costs. Market makers must put up their own capital to build up
stock inventory and securities houses need expensive computer and
telephone systems to trade.
   Small investors have to pay for a commission and the spread,
while institutional investors can find commission-free service.
Some firms refuse to handle individual customers because of the
expense.
   Another complaint is that the British paper settlement system,
which completes share transactions, is too slow and cumbersome. But
the exchange plans to introduce a new electronic settlement system
next fall, which could make trading faster and cheaper.
   Meanwhile, it also has ordered at least two market makers to
make competing price quotes on small shares starting in January.
   The London exchange stands by its system, saying it should be
the basis for a pan-European stock market the 12-member European
Community wants to create.
   ``We believe the competing market-making system is the right
system,'' said Michael Moore, head of service development at
London's exchange. ``And those markets that don't have some
electronic form of trading will find it difficult to survive.''
   But the exchange's chief executive, Peter Rawlins, said recently
the exchange is re-examining its business and infrastructure and
would decide by next spring how to move forward.

   ``Surviving unemployment. How to cope with
emotional pressures, assess your coping resources. Form a support
group.''
   The advertisement was enough to catch the eye of Rita Dalpe, an
unemployed software engineer who is surviving on temporary work,
fewer family vacations and no Christmas gifts this year.
   ``I'm just looking to hear that somebody is having the same
problems I am. I want to hear what other people are doing to keep
themselves on an even keel, how they keep from getting
discouraged,'' said Dalpe, who also fears her husband may be forced
to retire early from cash-strapped Digital Equipment Corp.
   Dalpe was among scores of people who responded to the ad,
reflecting a growing trend nationwide by people out of work who
need to talk about the misery of joblessness.
   ``People are feeling depressed, anxious, angry, irritable,''
said Dr. Eileen Schwartz, the psychologist who initiated the group.
   The demand for support for the unemployed is increasing.
   ``We just don't have enough support groups, here in southern
California or nationwide,'' said Dr. Paul Lees-Haley, a Los Angeles
psychologist who specializes in treating the unemployed.
   And Right Associates, which offers financial and career
counseling and weekly support sessions for laid-off workers, has
seen business at its 72 U.S. and Canadian offices increase 32
percent this year, said senior vice president Virginia Lord.
   ``The reality is: Unemployment is always difficult,'' said
Philip Quinn, director of the Massachusetts Bayview Center, which
runs employee assistance programs and has been increasingly called
on to help firms with layoff procedures.
   ``But when it goes from 4.9 percent to 7 percent, as it is here,
people feel they don't have much of a chance,'' he said.
   Nationwide, unemployment hit a three-year high of 5.9 percent in
November.
   People reporting to career counselors for job advice are
breaking down in tears, said Mary Muir, director of the
Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training's regional
office in Woburn.
   ``We are seeing a doubling over last year; 4,100 people are
collecting unemployment from our office,'' she said. ``And there
are more instances of people who are coming in quite distraught.''
   Even the people most of the world looks to for help - mental
health workers - are seeking support. The Cambridge-based Family
Institute hosts open houses two nights a week for unemployed mental
health workers.
   In California, workers in fields as diverse as the defense
industry to real estate are filing more workers' compensation
claims and personal injury claims, Lees-Haley said.
   ``Instead of going home and being depressed, they go to the
lawyer and be depressed and file a stress claim,'' he said.
   Experts say the unemployed complain of short tempers, trouble
sleeping and depression. Many people drink and use drugs more
heavily, may abuse family or friends or isolate themselves.
   Dalpe's family has been making sacrifices for the six years she
has been without a permanent job, in part so she can receive some
sort of counseling. Now, she and her husband are considering
selling their home in the Boston suburb of North Reading and moving
into a smaller, more affordable condominium.
   Sometimes, the worries can be overwhelming, she said.
   ``People of my generation were taught to believe if you got
training, it was a pretty sure thing you'd have a job. Obviously,
that isn't happening,'' she said. ``White collar unemployment is a
new area. Society doesn't know what to do with us.''

   For many of the nation's retailers, the
Christmas shopping season was a disappointing casualty of the
recession and the Middle East crisis - despite a last-minute burst
of business from procrastinating consumers.
   Some retailers were heartened by a late pickup in their sales.
Others, smarting from the poor season, were looking ahead to gloomy
times early next year.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, was among
those whose sales were hurt this season by consumer worries about
the economy and the Middle East.
   ``We're slightly below expectations,'' Matthew Howard, Sears'
senior vice president for marketing, said Monday evening as the
Christmas season drew to a close.
   However, Sears took comfort from its results the last three days
of the season, when shoppers responded to a new advertising
campaign and a new round of price reductions on a variety of
merchandise.
   ``We're pleased. We felt we got a good balance in all of the
businesses,'' Howard said in a telephone interview. The final
weekend left Sears' inventories ``in good shape,' he said.
   Other high-profile retailers reported a last-minute surge in
sales, but as in Sears' case, the extra business was not enough to
turn the entire season around.
   ``There was a bit of a rush that was encouraging, but as you
know, prior to this weekend it had been pretty sluggish,'' said
Suzanne McMillan, senior vice president for marketing at the
upscale Saks Fifth Avenue.
   At Dayton Hudson Corp., Chairman Kenneth Macke was clearly
disappointed with the season.
   When all the receipts are tallied, Dayton Hudson's sales will be
unchanged to 1 percent higher than the firm's Christmas 1989
results, Macke said Monday afternoon.
   ``I'm not feeling very happy,'' he said.
   Sales that are little changed or up very slightly are considered
poor because when the effects of inflation are subtracted, a
store's business may be down from year-earlier levels. Consumer
prices rose 6.4 percent through the first 11 months of this year,
meaning many stores' modest gains were wiped out.
   Predictions of a poor Christmas season were issued back in
August as sales of clothing, furniture, toys and appliances stalled
in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Sales for most retailers did not recover in September, October
and November, normally a time when their business accelerates.
After the Christmas season kicked off in late November, store
traffic and sales generally remained slow until the final weekend.
   The weather also worked against the retailers this Christmas. In
some parts of the Midwest, snow and ice kept shoppers at home, but
in many other areas, temperatures in the 50s and 60s curbed sales
of winter clothing.
   Like Sears, many retailers increased or moved up price
reductions - especially on coats and other cold-weather wear - in
the last few weeks in an effort to draw more shoppers.
   While the overall industry trend was poor, some retailers ended
the season pleased with their results.
   ``I'm delighted,'' Clark Johnson, chairman of Pier 1 Imports
Inc., said Christmas morning. ``We exceeded our expectations ...
and clearly it was the best Christmas we ever had.'' He said his
stores had a 3 percent increase from 1989's holiday sales.
   Johnson said the weakening economy actually helped his home
furnishings and clothing business as consumers ``traded down'' or
bought less expensive gifts this year. ``People that normally
bought gifts at higher-end shops came to Pier 1,'' he said.
   Other retailers also saw evidence of consumers trading down.
   At Dayton Hudson, business was strongest at the firm's Target
discount stores, where sales rose about 2 percent, Macke said.
Meanwhile, sales fell at the company's Dayton's, Hudson's and
Marshall Field's department stores, which have more expensive
merchandise.
   Jane Arend, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said Monday
her company was pleased with its results, but the retailer found it
hard to draw hesitant consumers into its stores. Ms. Arend said she
could not release any sales figures.
   The discount retailer has consistently outperformed other
storeowners throughout the season.
   What shoppers bought this season reflected the difficult times.
Dayton Hudson had more success with Levi's jeans than designer
jeans, and sweatshirts and sweatpants were among the most popular
items, Macke said.
   At Sears, tool sets and portable electric tools sold well.
   ``When you have a difficult economy, it's a more practical kind
of gift people seem to want to give,'' Howard said.
   Macke said the poor Christmas does not bode well for the first
half of 1991. ``If Santa Claus and Christmas can't bring people
into the stores, why are they going to be in in January and
February?'' he asked.
   But Johnson thought the last-minute surge was a good sign for
his stores. ``We had such tremendous traffic that there'll be nice
carryover momentum,'' he said.
