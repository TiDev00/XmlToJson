<HEAD>State Rejects Reading Textbooks Opposed by Fundamentalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state textbook committee on Wednesday rejected
a reading series opposed by fundamentalists because of references
to ghosts and scary themes like child abandonment. The publisher
called the vote censorship.
   ``It's a blessing,'' proclaimed Eric Coloney, a Peachtree City
parent opposed to the ``Impressions'' reading series.
   The 13-8 vote against the series virtually assures that most
school systems will not use it. The state Board of Education will
make final decisions in November. Schools can use books that aren't
on the approved state list but must use local funds to buy them.
   Several committee members expressed disappointment at the vote
against the series, which publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
designed as an innovative reading program for teachers. It uses the
so-called ``whole language'' approach in which pupils study real
children's literature rather than sample paragraphs and phonics
exercises.
   ``I do feel like the special-interest people influenced the
textbook selection process,'' said committee member Lynne Donehoo,
a Bibb County counselor.
   Mrs. Donehoo said that when parents and teachers in her area
reviewed ``Impressions,'' none objected to the content.
   But with the high-profile complaints against the series,
including 190 opposition phone calls to the state Department of
Education in recent days, committee members took a harder look at
the series, she said.
   Only 22 of 822 stories mention ghosts or goblins, and most of
the troubling issues raised in the stories - from adoption to
sexism to witchcraft - are addressed constructively in the
teacher's manual, said Jan Spalding, director of sales support
services for Harcourt Brace.
   Selections ranging from Laura Ingalls Wilder's ``Little House on
the Prairie'' to speeches from Martin Luther King Jr., both of
which appear in the books, got little attention as the committee
focused on witches, child abandonment, chants and ``scary''
pictures, she said.
   Joyce Washington-Bray, a reading specialist in Marietta and
member of the state committee that voted against the books, said
the content could detract from teaching.
   ``When it's this stuff about outer space, material that is eerie
- that muddies it up for thinking and reading,'' Ms.
Washington-Bray said.
   Said Pat Turner, an assistant principal from Americus city
schools: ``In some ways, I'd say we just went through a witch
hunt.''

<HEAD>Public Relations Nightmare: Mother vs. Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Violent crime, racial tensions, Korean grocery
boycotts - at least Mayor David Dinkins has a fighting chance
against them. But what are the options when you're under attack by
an 85-year-old saint-in-waiting?
   That public relations nightmare is now reality for Dinkins, who
was ripped this week by the heroic Mother Clara Hale over a city
policy that has kept children out of her nationally known group
care nursery for the past year.
   The city now requires placement of infants in foster care,
rather than in group centers such as Hale House. The decision is
costing the Harlem center $30,000 to $36,000 per month in city
subsidies, clouding its financial future.
   Mrs. Hale has charged the mayor is doing what white leaders tell
him. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, asserts he acted
independently, and adds that he can't believe that comment was ever
made.
   ``This is what happens when they give a black man a job. He does
what the white man tells him to do,'' the 85-year-old black woman
told The New York Times. Contacted at a Manhattan hospital where
she checked in last week with chest pains, she did not back off
that statement.
   Dinkins expressed disbelief when asked about the remark.
   ``That's just not true. I don't bow to anybody,'' said Dinkins,
whose wife, Joyce, was the host for Mother Hale's birthday party at
Gracie Mansion earlier this year.
   ``I doubt Mother Hale said that. If I heard Mother Hale say it,
I wouldn't believe Mother Hale said it. That's not our
relationship.''
   Mother Hale's credentials are many. More than 800 drug-addicted
infants have passed through her brownstone since 1969. President
Reagan hailed her as ``an American hero'' on national television
five years ago. Today, she still helps care for the babies she
calls her children.
   Mother Hale's care may be special, but the city position - one
echoed by experts - is that foster homes are better for the
children than group care centers. The city hasn't placed a child at
Hale House since October 1989.
   Hale House's operators believes the success of their program
speaks louder than any expert on what's best for the children. They
attempted to explain their position to Dinkins, but became
infuriated when their first meeting was rescheduled and the second
lasted less than five minutes.
   The meeting failed to change the mayor's mind and put Hale House
on the offensive, although Dinkins has offered to provide city
funds to it for other programs in an effort to keep it open.
   When Reagan praised Mother Hale five years ago, her center on
West 122nd Street was 70 percent government funded; today, it is
two-thirds subsidized by private contributions, said Jesse Devor,
public relations consultant for Hale House.
   Devor said it was only the center's good name that allowed it to
continue operating: ``If it wasn't for our visibility and our track
record, we'd be dead right now. ... It's a crisis, but we're still
viable.''
   There are 10 children staying at Hale House, which has space for
15. The length of the stay varies from child to child; it can be as
short as a few months, as long as two years, depending on the
rehabilitation of the parent or parents.
   With an eye to the future, Hale House is pumping up its fund
raising. Backers plan to distribute 100,000 bumper stickers reading
``The city says no. We say yes. Support Hale House.''
   While the Dinkins administration has sweated out the story,
Republican leaders quickly turned up the heat. A member of national
drug czar William Bennett's staff wasted no time in criticizing the
Democratic mayor's position.
   ``I don't know of many places like Hale House in the nation, and
not to use it is dreadful,'' said Herb Kleber, deputy director of
demand reduction for the Office of National Drug Control.
   Mother Hale's position was echoed by The City Sun, a black-owned
Brooklyn newspaper that questioned the city's motives in this
instance. ``Is it because some people in government don't think
black and Latino children are worth saving?'' asked an editorial.
   Dinkins responded simply that the charges are not so: ``Before,
they needed that kind of (group) care. They have plenty of foster
care today. Foster families ... are deemed to be an eminently
superior method of caring for children.''

<HEAD>NASA Identifies 83 Potential Leaks on Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA team trying to pinpoint
Columbia's dangerous hydrogen leaks has narrowed the list of
possible sources - to 83.
   ``Any combination might actually be the culprit,'' said William
Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   A hydrogen buildup in the shuttle's engine compartment during
fueling last week forced NASA to call off its fourth attempt to
send Columbia on an astronomy mission. Three of the postponements
were caused by hydrogen leaks.
   The shuttle is grounded until all leaks are found and fixed. A
nine-member investigative team assigned to the problem is
scrutinizing every item in Columbia's crowded engine compartment as
a possible source of leaks.
   ``Even if the first thing they do is find a big, roaring leak,
they will worry about how do we fix that leak, but they will
continue everywhere else to look for things that might also be
leaking,'' Lenoir said Wednesday.
   Workers will remove insulation from each suspected part and then
flush the system with non-flammable, room-temperature helium,
Lenoir said.
   If no leaks are found, the process will be repeated with a
different crew and equipment ``to be absolutely sure we haven't
missed anything,'' he said.
   So far, Columbia's leaks have appeared only when the shuttle's
external tank is filled with highly flammable liquid hydrogen at
super-cold temperatures, which might cause shrinkage of a metal
part and form the leak.
   To test for that possibility, the external tank will twice be
filled with cold liquid hydrogen, around mid-October and in
November. About a dozen TV cameras will be placed inside the engine
compartment for both tests.
   NASA, meanwhile, is working to send Discovery aloft Oct. 6 with
a satellite to study the sun's poles. The shuttle must fly within
the following 2{ weeks or else wait more than a year for the
planets to be in the right alignment.
   The space agency plans no tanking test for Discovery, the only
shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not been found. Such a check
would take five days.
   A tanking test will be performedon Atlantis before its early
November flight. Hydrogen leaks were detected on the spacecraft in
June.
   Lenoir said that he is hopeful Columbia can be back on track in
December but that there is no timetable.
   ``They're not driven by schedule. They are to go out and find
the leak, find all of the leaks, and then we can get on with it,''
he said.

   He walked into the bank wearing his
crash helmet and told a teller to put the cash in a plastic bag.
Then he fired one shot from his .38-caliber Smith and Wesson pistol
into the ceiling, strolled out and vanished on his red motorcycle.
   ``Bikerbank'' had struck for the 19th time.
   They seek him here, they seek him there and the public looks on,
enthralled by the cool precision that characterizes his crimes.
   State television has done a prime-time report on his exploits.
The daily Hadashot is running a series of articles, trying to
pierce the mystery of the man hiding behind the nickname and the
dark visor. An ex-commando? A former policeman? Theories abound.
   His adversary is a tough, mustachioed detective known to
colleagues as Shogun. He is Deputy Superintendent Chaim Pinchas,
head of special investigations in the Tel Aviv force.
   Shogun's prestige is at stake. Bikerbank has robbed 19 banks in
12 towns in 21 months, leaving no clue and description - just one
fingerprint that draws a blank in the police computer.
   He strikes between 10 a.m. and noon. He always robs the teller
nearest to the door. He's about 6 feet tall, wears cowboy boots
and, according to some witnesses, has a slight limp. He rides a
high-powered Suzuki motorcycle.
   Bikerbank's loot, so far, totals slightly more than $150,000.
   ``He took out a gun, showed it to everybody ... and shouted:
`This is a robbery.' He went straight for the counter,'' Reuven
Avraham, an official at a Bank Leumi branch in suburban Tel Aviv,
recalled on Israel Television.
   ``He did not care whether we pushed the buttons or used silent
alarm systems. I think he was there no longer than a minute and a
half,'' Avraham said.
   Officers have spent hours on stakeouts and roadblocks. Dozens of
bikers have been questioned. Some adorn their helmets and bikes
with stickers proclaiming ``I'm not the robber.''
   At least four suspects, including a reserve Air Force officer,
have been held. Vehicle registry records have been no help, and it
is believed his bike was bought from a tourist and not registered.
   When Bikerbank first struck in February 1989, the customer
behind him thought it was a joke and interfered, forcing the robber
to flash his pistol and fire in the air.
   ``Today, his actions are completely professional. ... He knows
where to find the weak spots of the police,'' investigator Pinchas
said.
   ``I don't think he has a criminal background. I think he comes
from a good family. Either he saw a lot of movies ... or had
contact with criminals and decided to go along this way,'' Amnon
Halper, a former senior detective, told Israel army radio.
   To compound police embarrassment, Bikerbank twice has struck
while suspects were being held.
   ``At some stage he began to provoke the police. ... It has
become something beyond robbery,'' Pinchas says.
   If the public is not outraged by Bikerbank, it may be because it
hasn't forgiven the banks for the 1983 stock market crash that
wiped out many people's savings. Israelis blame the banks for
manipulating the prices of their own shares to keep them
artificially high.
   The robber's nickname, Ofnobank, is an acronym of the Hebrew
words for biker and bank, a play on the catchy acronyms the banks
use to advertise their services.
   ``Some in the public have some sympathy for the man, but we have
to remember it's a real robbery, a weapon is being used and it's a
serious violation of the law,'' says Police Minister Roni Milo.
   Still, as long as Bikerbank doesn't shoot anyone, his scampish
image is likely to endure.
   ``I think the sympathy would be the same if he robbed government
ministries or post offices, anything linked to the establishment,''
said Noam Pinto, a spokesman for Bank Hapoalim.
   ``It's very frightening,'' Pinto said. ``So far nobody has been
hurt, but we worry for the safety of the workers and the public.
The workers are under orders to hand out the money without
provoking or opposing him.''
   Shogun vows:
   ``I will get him. It does not matter if he continues or stops.
One day we will get him.''

   Sue Ellen Orlando? Lothar Palmieri?
   Yes, children with first names like Toto and Samatha could
outnumber Pieros and Marias by the year 2000 in a country
increasingly influenced by television and soccer.
   An Italian Catholic magazine, in a national survey, found that
names linked to religious tradition are dropping in favor of names
of popular soccer and television stars.
   Francesco Ruppi, the archbishop of Lecce, in southern Italy,
called for a return to tradition.
   ``Baptize your children after the names of their grandfathers
... Give your children the joy of celebrating their name-day,'' the
archbishop said.
   Prospettive nel Mondo, a Rome-based Catholic monthly magazine,
reported that a recent survey showed that out of 100 girls born in
the past year, only two were named Maria. There were three
Elisabeths and one Catherine.
   Out of 100 boys there was only one Piero (Peter) and two
Giovannis (Johns).
   Instead, there were more Totos, Diegos and Lothars - named after
World Cup soccer stars Schillaci, Maradona and Matthaeus.
   Most Diegos - 23 out of 100 children - were in the area of
Naples, the southern Italian city where the Argentine star plays
with local major league team Napoli.
   Salvatore ``Toto'' Schillaci, the popular forward of the Italian
national team and of Juventus of Turin, was the leading scorer in
this summer's World Cup, earning him nationwide celebrity status.
   Schillaci, in keeping with the trend, named his own baby
daughter Jessica.
   Matthaeus, who plays in Italy with Internazionale of Milan, led
West Germany to the World Cup title in July.
   There's also an increasing number of Silvios and Rauls, named
for Italian television tycoon and A.C. Milan president Silvio
Berlusconi and Raul Gardini, head of the Ferruzzi agro-industrial
group and owner of Rome's Il Messaggero basketball team.
   Many children were named after the popular figures of soap
operas, such as Sue Ellen, Pamela and J.R. (called Geiar in Italy)
of ``Dallas.'' Others were given names of movie heroes, such as
Rocky.

   Magellan's latest pictures of Venus show
meteorite craters the size of Los Angeles, a river of solidified
lava 200 miles long and a collapsed volcano twice as deep as the
Grand Canyon.
   ``These are extremely jazzy images,'' said Gordon Pettengill, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist who leads the
spacecraft's radar science team.
   NASA displayed the pictures of the cloud-covered planet at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Tuesday.
   ``Believe me, it's giving us a revolutionary new view of
Venus,'' said Brown University geologist Jim Head, a Magellan
scientist.
   With Magellan only 10 days into its 243-day mission to map the
planet, Head advised: ``Don't touch your dial. We think we have a
blockbuster fall season.''
   Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist, displayed a
computer-generated videotape of three-dimensional images showing
Venus from the perspective of someone swooping down to and around a
crater on its surface.
   Magellan started its $744 million picture- and map-making
mission Sept. 15, two weeks later than planned because engineers
temporarily lost radio contact with the spacecraft twice in August.
   One picture displayed Tuesday shows two volcanoes, each with a
windblown fan of debris extending about six miles from the
mountain's summit crater. NASA said the fans look like ``fallout
from volcanic explosion plumes.''
   While Magellan hasn't seen a volcano actually erupting, it has
made pictures of so many volcanic features that ``there is an
excellent possibility there is active volcanism somewhere on the
planet,'' Head said.
   Magellan also spotted a caldera, or crater caused by the
collapse of a volcano's summit, almost two miles deep - roughly
twice the depth of the Grand Canyon and deeper than any other
caldera seen in the solar system, scientists said.
   A hardened lava river eight-tenths of a mile wide and about 200
miles long was mapped by Magellan as well.
   NASA also showed a picture of a meteorite impact crater about 28
miles wide. ``Greater Los Angeles would fit approximately in the
floor of this crater,'' Head said.
   Another picture showed three big impact craters, one of them
even larger, with a width of about 30 miles.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989 and arrived at Venus after traveling a looping path of 948
million miles.
   Chief engineer John Slonski Jr. said a backup computer that
played a role in the radio blackouts still malfunctions
occasionally, so contact might be lost again.
   The cause of the problems remains unknown. Suspicion focuses on
possible damage to electronic components that happened when
Magellan started orbiting Venus Aug. 10 and on static in the wiring
linking its computers, Slonski said.

   Carnegie Hall tonight begins a seasonlong
celebration of its 100th birthday, secure as a centerpiece of
American culture one generation after it nearly fell victim to the
wrecker's ball.
   The auditorium on West 57th Street, still sparkling from a $50
million facelift four years ago, will be host in the coming months
to the best and brightest of the music world, from pops to Placido
Domingo, from jazz to Jessye Norman.
   Opening night honors go to the Los Angeles Philharmonic,
conductor Andre Previn and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The second
night, also by the orchestra, will present the first of 13 pieces
of music commissioned by Carnegie for its centennial season. That's
the largest number of commissioned works ever in one season by an
American presenting organization.
   The second night premiere will be ``Angelus,'' based on the
chiming of bells and composed by Steven Stucky. Last December, a
month before he was 85, Sir Michael Tippett completed
``Byzantium,'' which will have its premiere in April by the Chicago
Symphony, with conductor Sir Georg Solti making his final visit to
Carnegie as music director of that orchestra.
   ``It's probably the most extraordinary season that any hall has
ever had,'' violinist Isaac Stern said.
   Stern has been president of Carnegie Hall since 1960 when he
saved it from the fate of being torn down so an office building
could rise on the corner of 57th Street and 7th Avenue.
   ``Carnegie Hall, when you're playing in form, makes a
performance larger than life. It's an enormously powerful hall and
it does give even average performers a glamour and power they
wouldn't have in other halls,'' Stern said in an interview shortly
before his 70th birthday in July.
   ``Carnegie was the place where you came to prove whether you
belonged or not. For that reason, it was very necessary to play
there. It still is. ... It has been the crown proving place for
every single orchestra, every one, every conductor, every pianist,
singer, violinist, cellist, jazz player, comedian, pop singer.''
   Andrew Carnegie donated $2 million, approximately nine-tenths of
the cost of construction. But it was Leopold Damrosch, founder of
both the Symphony Society, the city's second orchestra after the
New York Philharmonic, and the Oratorio Society, who felt New York
needed another large hall besides the Metropolitan Opera. His son,
Walter, music director of both organizations in 1887, happened to
sail that year on the same ship as Carnegie and his bride, who were
on their honeymoon. By the time the ship reached Europe, Carnegie
had agreed to build a fine concert hall in New York.
   Ten concerts starting April 26 will lead up to the centennial
date itself, May 5. The day will start with a morning concert by
eight choruses conducted by Robert Shaw. The New York Philharmonic,
conducted by Zubin Mehta and Leonard Bernstein, will perform at 4
p.m., take a dinner break and resume.
   Soloists at that concert will include sopranos Leontyne Price
and Miss Norman, mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, tenor Domingo,
pianist Rudolf Serkin, violinists Stern and Pinchas Zukerman,
cellists Mstislav Rostropovich and Yo-Yo Ma and the Empire Brass
Quintet.
   Carnegie Hall ``is the center from which the entire development
of American music came,'' Stern said. ``Nothing happened in this
country that didn't come through Carnegie.''
   The hall has been acclaimed throughout its history for its
architecture and acoustics.
   During the most recent renovation, workmen closed a hole that
had been cut in the ceiling over the stage for a movie in the
1940s. That and some other changes prompted some critics to
complain that the hall's warm acoustics had been damaged. In
response, a row of free-standing panels was built that can be
placed along the back wall behind orchestras.
   What's important to Stern is that Carnegie Hall - now restored
as much as possible to its 1891 look, with air-conditioning
improved and less street noise coming in - stands for another 100
years.
   ``It's something to hold on to, some connection with man's
involvement with education, with the quality of civilization. Those
are the things which are worthwhile.''

   Guenter Grass and other authors are
among the last holdout opponents to unification, firing salvos of
dissent that have not damaged the unity express but have fractured
the German intelligenstia.
   The debate has triggered a furious philosophical feud over
whether star East German writers like Christa Wolf indirectly
bolstered the hard-line Communist state by not actively opposing
it.
   Some leftist German writers have charged that the real
beneficiaries of unification are not the common people, but
businessmen and politicians who stand to reap financial and
political profits.
   But many critics maintain that Grass and other members of
Germany's mostly leftist literary pantheon are hopelessly out of
touch with the rest of the population.
   ``The foremost feature of these people is an unbelievable
vanity,'' Enno von Loewenstern, editorial writer for the
conservative Die Welt newspaper, said in an interview. ``If the
common folk refuse to follow their line, they have not wakened to
their true consciousness.''
   Conservative writers from both Germanys have expressed similar
views.
   The debate began soon after the first cracks appeared in the
Berlin Wall last fall.
   Wolf, novelist Stefan Heym and other East Germans published a
manifesto warning against ``a sellout of material and moral
values'' to their rich West German neighbors.
   The message was that East Germany - with a new democratic
government and freedom for the people - was something worth
preserving.
   West German critics asked why the same East German intellectuals
hadn't been as loud with critical pronouncements during Stalinist
rule.
   The ultimate question was: Had East German intellectuals
acquiesced to the repressive rule for the special privileges
bestowed upon artists and writers?
   The debate turned angrier when Wolf published an
autobiographical novella called ``What Remains'' in which she
suggested she had been hounded by the Stasi secret police in the
late 1970s.
   A critic for Die Welt questioned whether Wolf has the right to
portray herself as a ``martyr because she had to endure three Stasi
observers sitting in a car across from her apartment.''
   ``Many people ... have lived through this and worse,'' the
critic said.
   Grass and other leftist West German authors have rushed to
Wolf's defense.
   He has compared the campaign against Wolf to an inquisition and
said it could do irreparable damage to the German intellectual
community.
   Grass has accused Wolf's critics of hypocrisy, pointing out that
no one seemed to mind during the Communist years that her status
allowed her to deliver readings and lectures to enrapt listeners
and reviewers in the West.
   The debate goes beyond whether East German intellectuals chose a
cozy life under Communist rule over trying to bring about real
change.
   At the heart of all the arguing is unification itself.
   This spring, millions of East Germans loudly voiced their
support for unification by shouting ``We are one people!'' at
election rallies.
   German intellectuals heard the cry, but many leftist writers say
unity is a mistake.
   Grass, evoking the Third Reich and Auschwitz, at one point said
a united Germany would be a danger to itself and other nations.
   In in interview in early September, Grass said he favored a
confederation between the two Germanys but not unification.
   ``The (previous) united German state lasted briefly, from
Bismarck to 1945. It was only 70 years and was the unhappiest phase
in all of German history and in European history as well,'' he
said.
   East German Heiner Mueller, one of Europe's best-known
playwrights and a die-hard socialist, says the Germans' destiny has
been taken from their hands by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
the architect of unification.
   ``What's happening now is an economic conquest'' of East
Germany, he said.
   Other intellectuals disagree.
   Martin Walser, the West German novelist, said the East Germans
do control their destiny. They could have chosen to create a free
socialist state as, he points out, was favored by many
intellectuals.
   ``I would have said, `OK, if that's what you believe,''' Walser
said in a recent newspaper interview. ``But the people decided on
something else.''
   Reiner Kunze, a leading poet who was thrown out of East Germany
in 1977, has scolded Grass for his views. ``No one needs to fear
Germany,'' Kunze said.
   West German Patrick Sueskind, author of the best-selling novel
``Perfume,'' has written a new book titled ``Fear of Germany,'' in
which he takes aim at the hoopla and hype accompanying unification.
   He said the idea of unity has taken his generation of postwar
baby-boomers by surprise.
   ``We thought we had a grasp on our existence and understood the
world ... and now we're suddenly confronted with this midlife
crisis,'' Sueskind writes.
   ``We were prepared for impotence, for prostate problems, false
teeth, menopause, for cancer .... death and the devil - but
definitely not for Deutsch-land-ei-nig-Va-ter-land!''
   The phrase means ``Germany, united fatherland,'' a favorite
chant at East German election rallies this year.

<HEAD>House Reported Nearing Compromise on Obscene Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   House negotiators are reported near agreement
on legislation to extend the life of the National Endowment for the
Arts and let the courts decide whether its grant recipients have
violated obscenity laws.
   ``I think we're going to get a deal,'' said Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., a central figure in House bargaining over the fate of the
embattled federal arts agency.
   In an interview Tuesday, Williams predicted that lengthy talks
with Rep. E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., will yield a compromise on the
``obscene art'' issue that will attract the support of a solid
majority of House members.
   He said the compromise is likely to be patterned after a formula
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee approved last week
with strong bipartisan backing.
   The Senate bill would require the NEA to recoup grant money from
artists who are convicted of using federal funds to produce works
that violate obscenity laws. The guilty artists would be barred
from receiving further NEA grants for at least three years.
   On Thursday, the House tentatively plans to begin what promises
to be a bruising floor battle over a proposed five-year extension
of the arts endowment, whose statutory authority expires Sunday.
   Lawmakers readied no fewer than two dozen amendments, most of
them seeking to prohibit NEA support for works that might be
considered obscene or sacrilegious. One proposal would abolish the
arts endowment altogether.
   Strict anti-obscenity curbs imposed on the endowment last fall
at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., also will lapse next
week when the current fiscal year ends, unless Congress renews them
in some form.
   In a related development, the House Appropriations Committee on
Tuesday rebuffed an attempt by its chairman, Rep. Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss., to recommend forbidding the NEA to finance ``any indecent,
anti-religious or obscene picture, play or writing.''
   On a voice vote, the committee eliminated Whitten's non-binding
proposal from a stopgap bill intended to keep the federal
government operating at current spending levels for the first three
weeks of the new fiscal year - until Oct. 20 - and to provide $2
billion for U.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf.
   The effect of the bill, later approved and sent to the House
floor, was to continue the NEA temporarily at the level of its
current, $171 million budget, with the Helms anti-obscenity curbs
intact.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., argued that Whitten's anti-obscenity
proposal should be considered later, when the committee acts on the
NEA's proposed $180 million appropriations bill for next year.
   The prospective compromise between Williams and Coleman,
opposing figures in the NEA controversy, would leave to the courts
- not the endowment - the responsibility for deciding whether
federally subsidized works are obscene.
   Coleman previously had proposed forbidding the NEA from
supporting works that meet the Supreme Court's obscenity standards.
The Helms ban went further, prohibiting support for any works that
``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of
homoeroticism, sadomasochism and sexual exploitation of children.
   Williams said another Coleman proposal to shift 60 percent of
NEA grant money to the control of state arts agencies remains in
dispute. He said the compromise bill may include a limited increase
in the 20 percent of grant funds currently allocated to the states.
   Colemot return calls seeking comment.
   Williams, a staunch NEA supporter, is chief sponsor of the Bush
administration's original bill to extend the NEA's life for five
years without any anti-obscenity restrictions.
   Congressional sources said the House probably would vote for a
shorter extension, perhaps three or four years, to allow Congress
more frequent reviews of NEA operations.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, expressed support Tuesday for a
proposed amendment by Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., that would abolish
the NEA. Armey said he found ``abhorrent the very existence of a
politically appointed government panel charged with determining
what art is worthy of funding.''

   How long can a nation embroiled in a costly
military standoff endure harsh economic sanctions? Not Iraq - the
United States.
   Americans may get a chance to find out as early as Monday if
Congress and the White House fail to reach a budget agreement.
   No one calls them sanctions, but the automatic spending cuts
that would be triggered under the Gramm-Rudman law could have some
of the same consequences: possible food shortages, massive
transportation disruptions and a heavy drain on economic growth.
   These are self-inflicted sanctions that are written into the law
intended to lead to a balanced federal budget by 1993.
   The impact of the cuts - from $85 billion to $100 billion -
combined with higher energy prices resulting from the Middle East
crisis could easily topple the U.S. economy into a recession, many
economists suggest.
   And that's even before the $1-billion-a-month cost of the
Persian Gulf military operation is factored in.
   With the budget talks deadlocked, President Bush is giving no
signs of blinking first in what Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., says
``is a game of chicken, that's all it is.''
   Bush was quick on Tuesday to show he won't go along with a
Democratic-led effort to delay the spending targets at least until
Oct. 20 to give budget negotiators more breathing room.
   Shortly after the House Appropriations Committee approved
stopgap legislation calling for such a delay, Bush told reporters,
``I will veto'' any spending measure that ``suspends Gramm-Rudman
and budget discipline.''
   White House officials say they are bracing for the spending cuts
to take effect Monday.
   Although perennial financial crises in Washington have a solid
history of evaporating in 11th-hour compromises, some key
presidential aides have said privately that this time the
resolution may not come until after spending cuts actually take
hold.
   At the same time, officials say Bush has no plans to curtail his
plans to travel extensively around the country in October
campaigning for Republican candidates - even if the spending cuts
take place.
   Bush, who is off today for two days of campaigning in the
Midwest, has scheduled campaign trips for Oct. 4-5, 10, 15-16 and
25-28.
   However, he may have to do it without part of his staff and he
may find it difficult to travel at night.
   Most of the nation's 2.2 million federal employees already have
been warned they may be furloughed to a shorter work week beginning
next week - including most White House employees.
   The National Weather Service has said it will close 250 weather
stations from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. beginning Monday in the absence of a
budget agreement, including those that provide local weather
information to pilots.
   That, combined with plans by the Federal Aviation Administration
to sharply cut back on the number of air traffic controllers, could
keep most flights grounded at night.
   ``And if you think that sounds draconian, you ain't seen nothing
yet,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Noting that the Gramm-Rudman cuts will force a 40 percent
across-the-board cutback in most government programs, Fitzwater
said: ``You're going to see a lot more dramatic and difficult
things to deal with than night flights.''
   Administration budget officials have said that imposition of the
spending cuts also may delay Medicare and Social Security checks
and could result in food shortages because of reductions in
government inspections.
   They also say the cuts will mean fewer guards in prisons, a halt
to toxic waste sites, elimination of Pell Grants to 1.2 million
college students and reductions in programs for vaccinating
children.
   And Fitzwater may not be on hand to brief reporters on these
developments.
   Like the rest of his press office staff, Fitzwater has himself
received a furlough notice. (Secret Service agents are among the
few in the White House exempted.)
   ``Basically, in my office, the way the furlough would work would
be essentially everybody would be off one day a week for the first
couple weeks, and then two days a week for the next several weeks
and so forth,'' the press secretary said.

   CBS finally made it out of the ratings
basement and shot to No. 1 in the opening week of the fall season.
   In a photo finish for first place, CBS nosed ahead of usually
top-rated NBC last week by two-tenths of a ratings point in the
tightest premiere race since 1966.
   It was the first time in six years that CBS won the fall
season's opening week.
   CBS had a 13.6 average rating, NBC a 13.4 and ABC a 13.2, the
A.C. Nielsen Co. said Tuesday. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   NBC responded to the ratings with a news release that began,
``Premiere week almost by definition is an atypical week.''
   In a top 10 list where every show but one was a season premiere,
NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top-rated program. CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
which began its new season the previous week, tied for third with
the network's ``Designing Women.''
   ABC's lone top 10 entry was the fall premiere of ``Roseanne,''
which finished second.
   ``The Cosby Show'' opened its season at No. 5 and again
embarrassed ``The Simpsons,'' which has plummeted in the ratings
since moving to the same time period. It was last in its time slot
and 67th for the week.
   At CBS, executives were ecstatic about finishing first but
cautious about calling it a season-long trend.
   ``We're not saying we're going to be No. 1'' all the time, said
CBS ratings expert David Poltrack. ``But we are going to be
competitive.''
   CBS has the most new shows this fall. Ten of CBS' 13 original
series have aired. The ambitious slate represents the first fall
schedule delivered by entertainment president Jeff Sagansky, who
has held the job less than a year.
   ``His instincts and his collaborative spirit have changed the
whole atmosphere of this place,'' said Poltrack.
   CBS hasn't won a season since 1984, when its lineup included
``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest'' and ``Magnum, P.I.''
   There also was a twist in the network news ratings, with NBC and
Tom Brokaw breaking out of last place for the first time since
July.
   NBC ranked second with an 8.8 average, edging past CBS and Dan
Rather with an 8.5. In first for the 37th consecutive week were ABC
and Peter Jennings with a 10.3.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 22; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 20.1; ``Designing Women'' and ``60
Minutes,'' CBS (tie), 20; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 19.8; ``Murphy
Brown,'' CBS, 19.6; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, 18.8; ``A Different
World,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 18.4; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, ``Major Dad,'' CBS, (tie) 17.7.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, in an astonishing speech
by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, is suddenly in the
forefront of the international drive against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, while pushing relations with the United States to
unprecedented heights.
   The two superpowers are still haggling over arms control
measures. Unless Secretary of State James A. Baker III achieves a
sudden breakthrough today in a private meeting with Shevardnadze,
two summits may have to be set back.
   But with world attention riveted on the United Nations and the
precarious pressure campaign to force Iraq to relinquish its
conquest of Kuwait, Shevardnadze has given President Bush all the
support he could hope to have - and then some.
   The genial Georgian, who sits at Mikhail S. Gorbachev's right
hand in the Soviet power structure, not only blasted Saddam on
Tuesday as a terrorist threatening the new world order but
suggested his seizure of Kuwait might call for a war crimes trial.
   Those who take hostages, employ torture and threaten other
nations with destruction are engaged in ``crimes against humanity''
and should be judged by an international tribunal, Shevardnadze
said.
   Moreover, the Soviet foreign minister raised the prospect of a
U.N. military force against Iraq if the 7-week-old economic
blockade fails to induce Saddam to give up the oil-rich emirate.
   ``The United Nations has the power to suppress acts of
aggression,'' Shevardnadze observed.
   The first proposition conjured up images of the Nuremberg trials
of Nazi leaders after World War II. The second carried echoes of
President Harry S. Truman's U.N.-sanctioned defense of South Korea
against aggression from the north.
   Significantly, both proposals were sterner than any advanced by
the Bush administration. In some ways, Shevardnadze vaulted past
the United States in taking the moral high ground against Baghdad.
   ``It was a very strong speech,'' Canadian Foreign Minister Joe
Clark said afterward. ``It certainly indicates that we are in a new
era of international affairs.''
   Clark also complimented Shevardnadze for the way he chaired
Tuesday's U.N. Security Council session, in which the body voted
14-1 to impose an air embargo against Iraq. ``It is a dramatic
demonstration of how much has changed internationally,'' he said.
   U.S.-Soviet relations have been on the upsurge for years, but
until the Soviets withdrew their troops from Afghanistan in 1988
many in Washington questioned the sincerity of Gorbachev's moves.
   Even in this new era of good feelings, the two sides still are
struggling to resolve their differences over cutting long-range
nuclear weapons and reducing their tanks and other conventional
arms in Europe.
   Failure to agree on nuclear cutbacks could imperil the trip Bush
hoped to take to Moscow in December to sign a treaty slashing
long-range arsenals of bombers, submarines and intercontinental
ballistic missiles. The dispute over conventional forces could
postpone the 35-nation summit France proposed to host in Paris in
mid-November.
   There is time to rescue both pacts. In the meantime, cooperation
on coping with the crisis in the Persian Gulf is at a maximum.
   When Bush set out in early August to impose an economic
stranglehold on Saddam he encountered some hesitation from Moscow.
   Soviet support was considered essential for several reasons.
   First of all, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council
the Soviets could kill any measure against Iraq. Second, the United
States needed the other superpower's support to persuade the world
the campaign against Iraq was not a solo show of force by
Washington.
   Third, the credibility of the campaign would gain immensely if
it had the support of the Soviets since they had been allies of
Iraq.
   The Soviet hesitation on sanctions recurred in late August when
the Bush administration went back to the Security Council to
enforce the sanctions.
   Again, Moscow's anxieties about inflaming a touchy situation
yielded to a judgment that Saddam must be contained despite the
risk.
   Two weeks ago, Bush and Gorbachev agreed in Helsinki, Finland,
that additional measures might be required. The imposition of a
U.N. air blockade was the result.
   Not too many years ago, the Soviets were the targets of the sort
of condemnation Shevardnadze heaped on Saddam. Their actions in
Eastern Europe and treatment of their own people generated the kind
of outrage now being visited on Iraq.
   But now, as Gorbachev struggles to transform the Soviet Union
into a market economy with and to institute political democracy,
Shevardnadze appealed to Iraq's leaders ``to obey the demands of
the law and also of plain common sense, to take a responsible and
human attitude.''
   He said the Soviets are making the appeal as old friends of the
Iraqis.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviets spoke also ``as a country that
found the courage to condemn its own wrongdoings against certain
states in the past.''
   Such admissions are rare on the world diplomatic stage and they
served to intensify the respect Shevardnadze earned with his
speech.

<TEXT>
   The Bridge of Friendship over the Danube
once symbolized comradely communist ties between Bulgaria and
Romania, but it's been a source of tension since authorities began
cracking down on smugglers.
   It can take as long as three days toget across the bridge
between Russe, Bulgaria and this town 60 miles south of Bucharest,
heating up tempers and radiators alike.
   Under the two countries' former Communist governments, lines
were virtually non-existent because travel and the opportunity for
private trading were strictly limited.
   All that changed after last year's democratic upheaval.
   The Romanian and Bulgarian economies are in chaos as new
goverments start steering away from central planning and toward
free-market practices, and Romanians who face shortages of basic
foods such as bread and sugar at home are going on shopping sprees
in Turkey.
   They can even pick up some coffee in Bulgaria, through which
they must travel on their way to Turkey.
   The goods are sold for a profit back home.
   Bulgarians, whose economy has been sliding into deepening
crisis, face strict food rationing themselves.
   In August, Bulgaria said Romanians could travel within Bulgaria
only on organized tours or in transit to another point. Authorities
cited a cholera epidemic in Romania but many Romanians believe the
reason behind the clampdown was to stop illegal cross-border trade.
   The state Bulgarian news agency BTA charged that: ``in Russe,
the Romanians swear they are transit travelers. ... However, having
struck quick bargains on the Bulgarian black market, they go back,
explaining their cars broke down.''
   In a recent televised speech, Romanian President Ion Iliescu
attacked ``speculators ... who think the free market is a way to
get rich quickly.''
   Growing Romanian-Bulgarian antipathy got a further boost when
Romanian television showed footage of Bulgarian militiamen at the
Russe station beating Romanians who didn't have correct papers and
forcing them back across the border.
   Since summer, lines at Romanian customs have been growing and
relations with Sofia have started to strain.
   Seething Soviet truck drivers now jockey daily with Turkish
emigrant workers and Romanian unofficial traders for a place on the
rickety 1{-mile bridge over the Danube River.
   Experienced travelers arrive prepared with food, drink and extra
gasoline for the crossing.
   At the Giurgiu customs post recently, a handful of officials -
no more than in the days of former dictator Nicolae Ceauscescu -
deliberately search every car and often confiscate hidden taxable
goods.
   Smugglers offer cigarettes and whisky as bribes.
   Fights break out occasionally in the midday heat, as drivers
squabble about who should go first. The lines trail back miles over
the bridge and spew into the opposite lanes, blocking the way to
Bulgaria.
   Bucharest officials say there are no plans to widen the
40-year-old bridge or add lanes to the customs crossing.

   Baghdad has boosted its troop strength in
Kuwait and southern Iraq by more than 50 percent over the past two
weeks to a total of about 430,000 men, the Pentagon says.
   In the past week President Saddam Hussein has added 70,000
troops to the area, following an increase of 95,000 the previous
week, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The United States has about 165,000 troops in the Persian Gulf
region.
   Separately, a senior Pentagon official disclosed that Soviet
military advisers in Iraq are performing maintenance on Iraqi
aircraft behind the front lines.
   The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
U.S. intelligence analysts believe that between 500 and 1,000
Soviet advisers remain in Iraq and that an undetermined number are
helping maintain Iraq's warplanes.
   ``We're not very sure about exactly what they're doing'' in Iraq
beyond working on aircraft and performing unspecified training
roles for the Iraqi military, the official said.
   He added that withdrawal of the Soviet advisers would not have
much effect on Iraq's military capabilities.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said Iraq has shifted
mechanized forces back from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia into
``tactical reserve positions.'' They are being replaced on the
front line with infantry units, he said. The result has been a
large increase in the total number of troops in the area.
   ``Our analysts think that what they're gaining is flexibility''
for the mechanized units, Williams said.
   The spokesman said the reported increases in Iraqi troops and
tank deployments are partly due to the Pentagon including a larger
geographic area in its count. Williams said he could not estimate
how much of the increase was due to this factor, which he said
reflected the wider deployment of mechanized forces.
   Williams said the Iraqi deployments still appear to be
``essentially a defensive force,'' but are capable of readily
converting to an offensive strike force.
   The number of Iraqi tanks in the Kuwait theater has jumped by
700 from last week to 3,500 tanks, Williams said, and the number of
armored personnel carriers has risen to 2,500, an increase of 700.
Artillery pieces now total about 1,700, up by 250.
   Williams said the United States had no plan to increase its
deployment of forces to Saudi Arabia as a result of the continuing
Iraqi buildup. U.S. forces are still flowing into the area.

<TEXT>
   A week before key elections, most
Brazilians seem apathetic about choosing a national congress and
state governors.
   The Oct. 3 election is the first since voters in December made
Fernando Collor de Mello Brazil's first freely elected president in
29 years.
   Almost all 570 congressional seats are up for grabs, as well as
all 26 state governorships. Runoffs will be held in mid-November if
no gubernatorial candidate receives an absolute majority in next
Wednesday's vote.
   Polls show the country is sharply divided on the Collor
administration. Still, conservatives sympathetic to his free-market
economic reform are expected to win the majority of governor's
chairs.
   The same outcome is being forecast on the congressional side,
even though polls show voters aren't familiar with the candidates.
A recent survey in Rio revealed 74 percent of the voters were
undecided.
   The lack of enthusiasm is striking compared with the
population's high involvement in last year's vote between Collor
and socialist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.
   Some observers say that after 25 years of military dictatorship,
which ended in 1985, Brazilians have had an ``overdose'' of
democracy. Federal, state or local elections have now been held in
five of the last six years.
   ``This accumulation of elections is going to transform the
electoral process into something so routine and boring hat nobody's
going to want to know anything about it,'' said Mario Amato, a
business leader.
   Others say the apathy stems from a frustration with the last six
years of civilian rule.
   Elected government ``was seen as the country's salvation from
misery and corruption, and it was nothing of the sort,'' said Rep.
Fabio Feldman of the center-left Brazilian Social Democratic Party.
``Grave problems are not resolved with miracles.''
   Also dimming voter interest is widespread dirty campaigning. In
several states, electoral courts temporarily suspended TV ads after
mudslinging reached alarming proportions.
   In Rio, opponents of Leonel Brizola, heavily favored in the
governor's race, bribed poor children with sweets and sandwiches to
alter the words from his campaign song from ``La-la-la-Brizola'' to
``Blah-blah-blah Brizola.''
   A film of the scene ran as TV spots for several nights before a
judge banned the ad.
   The country's leftist parties, once expected to benefit from
voter anger about Collor's tough economic austerity measures, are
suffering most from the voter apathy.
   They depend more on active participation from their supporters
than do the largely money-driven campaigns of most conservatives.
   Analysts say the opposition has also hurt by internal squabbles.
   After uniting behind da Silva's candidacy last year, leftist
alliances disintegrated; new coalitions may emerge only for
second-round governor's races.
   ``The left has been totally incompetent,'' said political
observer David Fleischer. ``It has failed to recover
psychologically from last year's presidential defeat and is blowing
its chance due to petty quarrels.

   South African President F. W. de Klerk says
the new system he envisions for his country will ensure that no
racial group - black or white - will ever be able to achieve
political domination again.
   Speaking to reporters hours before ending his official visit
Tuesday, de Klerk ruled out a ``winner-take-all'' electoral
approach in which broad powers are granted to one person.
   Never again, he said, should there be a situation in which a
powerful executive, regardless of color, is ``in a strong position
to suppress'' South Africans of different races.
   De Klerk said he foresees a new system in which there will be a
sharing of power within the executive branch, thus guarding against
any concentration of authority.
   During his three-day visit, the first by a South African head of
state since 1945, de Klerk relentlessly sought to convince doubters
in the United States that his country is embarking on a new era of
democracy and racial equality.
   ``I want to say here today that the time has come to realize
that apartheid is really something of the past,'' he said at a
National Press Club luncheon.
   As proof, he said more than 100 discriminatory laws and
regulations have been removed from the statute books. He promised
that the remaining impediments will be erased by the time a new
constitution takes effect.
   De Klerk also said he was determined to avoid the chaos that has
prevailed in many other African countries in the post-independence
era.
   ``We intend to ensure that our plan will absolutely and
effectively prevent South Africa from becoming just another typical
African one-party state, sliding down the scale of poverty into
oblivion,'' he said.
   ``We intend to ensure that the new South Africa will be based on
the very values which we share with you.''
   De Klerk said the issue of U.S. sanctions against South Africa
were discussed only indirectly in his talks with President Bush,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and congressional leaders.
   ``I did not put forward any specific requests,'' he said. The
sanctions, among other things, bar new U.S. investment in South
Africa and forbid South African aircraft from landing in the United
States.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip and
top-ranking black in Congress, said he ``came away hopeful'' from
de Klerk's session with congressional leaders.
   Gray said he told de Klerk that Congress will not be ready to
ease sanctions until South Africa writes a new constitution
removing the legal pillars of apartheid.
   ``Apartheid is alive and well and a reality and until there is a
new constitution there will be no significant change in that
society,'' Gray said.
   Asked about the impact of the sanctions, de Klerk said, ``To a
great extent it was counterproductive. People under threat tend to
react negatively. We don't like as a country to be prescribed to by
other countries. And there's an emotional reaction which is brought
about by that.''
   He said South Africa began moving toward abandoning its
apartheid system not because of the sanctions ``but because we
believed it must be done.''
   ``We are going to do it whether the legislation was instituted
or not. We would have done it according to the policies which we
have accepted,'' he said.
   De Klerk has moved partway toward creating conditions that would
permit the lifting of sanctions through a series of measures.
   These include freeing African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela and other political prisoners, ending the state of
emergency in all but one province, lifting bans on democratic
political parties and agreeing to negotiate a new democratic
system.

<HEAD>Canada's Most Hated Tax Takes Center Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented constitutional battle over a
hated tax is shaping up between Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Conservative-controlled House of Commons and the Liberal majority
in the usually somnolent Senate.
   The object of the revilement: the Goods and Services Tax.
   Polls indicate 75 to 85 percent of Canadians oppose the 7
percent tax. It will be imposed on nearly all merchandise and
services beginning Jan. 1 - on top of the existing provincial sales
taxes, which range from 8 to 10 percent.
   That is, if the Senate doesn't kill it off.
   The confrontation pits the elected House of Commons against the
unelected Senate, which Canadians refer to with a snicker as
Parliament's chamber of sober second thought.
   Senate seats long have been used as payoffs for political
service rendered and the chamber rarely has roused itself to do
battle over burning issues of the day.
   The so-called GST tax bill was approved by the House in March.
The government then proceeded with plans for collecting the tax as
if its passage was a foregone conclusion, ignoring claims that it
is bafflingly complex.
   One letter to the editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail said the
government's GST Guide Book for accountants is a nightmare, ``400
pages and growing.''
   But suddenly, last week, Liberal opposition leader Jean Chretien
announced that his party would try to kill the measure in the
Senate. On Monday, Banking Committee Chairman Sidney Buckwold
recommended that the Senate kill the bill.
   ``It's a very bad piece of legislation that Canadians by the
millions asked the Senate to reject and we've acted accordingly,''
said Buckwold.
   ``We want to have a quick vote to kill the GST,'' Chretien said
Tuesday.
   Sensing growing resentment against the tax, Mulroney filled 15
vacant Senate seats with Conservatives over the past month, but
that wasn't enough.
   The Liberals hold 52 seats in the 104-seat chamber and the
Conservatives 46. The remaining seats are held by one Reform Party
member and five independents.
   The prime minister was said to be considering a resort to an
obscure, never used section of the constitution which would allow
him to ask the queen to appoint up to eight extra senators. That
still would not guarantee success, leaving the fate of the tax in
the hands of the independents.
   The 7 percent tax would replace the 13.5 percent Manufacturers
Sales Tax, which raises about $10 billion a year but is considered
inefficient and levied on a very narrow base.
   ``The argument is that it (the Manufacturers Sales Tax)
discriminates heavily against manufacturing industries in Canada
and against Canadian firms vis-a-vis imports,'' said Dr. Robin
Boadway, a professor of economics at Queen's University and an
expert on taxation.
   ``The GST is essentially the same as the value-added tax that
the Europeans use,'' said Boadway.
   But consumers, already paying 8 to 10 percent in provincial
sales taxes, are horrified at the prospect of seeing 15 to 17
percent tacked on their purchases, plumbing bills, haircuts and
music lessons.
   Manufacturers love it.
   ``Dismantling the existing federal sales tax would remove a
longstanding source of competitive disadvantage for Canadian
manufacturers, exporters, and all businesses that compete with
imports in the domestic Canadian market,'' said Thomas d'Aquino,
president of the Canadian Business Council.
   One of the main fears of the tax-paying public, however, is that
once the tax has been implemented, governments will be very tempted
to hike the rate.
   ``It has such a broad base, it can raise a lot of revenue with
small rate increases,'' said Boadway.
   Out in the tiny Saskatchewan village of Elstow, population 140,
Mayor Brad Cabana's town council has voted not to collect or pay
the GST, come what may.
   ``It's another example of government not listening to the
people,'' he said. ``It's not a fair tax and it's quite
inflationary.''

   Israeli analysts say they see little
likelihood of Palestinians launching a terrorist attack in support
of Saddam Hussein unless war breaks out between Iraq and the
U.S.-led forces arrayed against it.
   But they say Palestinian militants are ready to do the Iraqi
president's bidding, and raise the possibility of Palestinians
acting separately to draw attention from the Persian Gulf crisis to
their own plight.
   The assessments come from Anat Kurz and David Tal of the Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, a Tel Aviv University research group.
The two addressed a news conference Tuesday presenting the center's
survey of international terrorism in 1989.
   Tal pointed to statements by extremists on the fringes of the
Palestine Liberation Organization expressing readiness to act on
Iraq's behalf.
   He also spoke of attempts by Saddam to make contact with Abu
Nidal, the PLO renegade behind some of the worst terrorist
incidents of the 1980s.
   However, Tal added, ``So far we can say quite clearly that the
Palestinians and Iraq are not going to initiate a spate of
terrorism.''
   He doubted the mainstream PLO wants to be involved in terrorism,
and said all Palestinian declarations so far ``refer to a case in
which a war or hostile activity erupts.''
   ``So I think the Palestinians will turn to terrorism only if
hostile activity starts,'' he said.
   Tal said he was trying to assess the threat logically, ``but of
course I can never tell whether Abu Nidal will feel that this is
the time to help Saddam Hussein, even if Saddam Hussein doesn't
know it.''
   Ms. Kurz saw a growing danger of PLO elements taking the
initiative even if their attacks ``contradict the timing and
interests of Baghdad.''
   This could happen, she said, not out of solidarity with Iraq but
as ``an expression of frustration and an effort to bring back the
Palestinian issue and the intefadeh (the anti-Israeli uprising in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip) back to the headlines.''
   ``The probability of this kind of threat seems to be increasing
as long the (gulf) crisis becomes a protracted stalemate,'' she
said.
   The center's report counted 406 incidents of international
terrorism in 1989, compared with 433 in 1988 and 377 in 1987.
   Bombing and arson remained the most common tactics, accounting
for 49 percent of incidents. Armed assaults accounted for 35.5
percent, kidnappings for 5.9 percent, and ``specific and concrete
threats'' for 6.7 percent.
   Latin America suffered the most terrorism in 1989 - 39 percent
of all incidents.
   Western Europe accounted for 19.7 percent, down from 24.2
percent in 1988.
   The report said 553 people were killed by international
terrorism, 278 of them by bombs planted on two planes - one that
blew up over the Sahara and another in Colombia.
   Trends changed little from 1988, it said. Political figures were
targeted in 42.1 percent of attacks, economic objectives in 32
percent, and the public in 22.6 percent.

   Conductor Carlos Kleiber brought magic to
Strauss' ``Der Rosenkavalier'' on the second night of the
Metropolitan Opera's season.
   The English soprano Felicity Lott, who has been singing opera
regularly at Covent Garden, made her Met debut as the Marschallin.
Her voice is lovely, though not large.
   In fact, all voices at the Met on Tuesday night seemed either
small or held back. One listened very much to the orchestra, as
Kleiber brought out subthemes and made the music glow.
   Anne Sofie von Otter is the best-looking Octavian we've seen.
She is slim and straight and moves like a true young gentleman.
Instead of the plummy mezzo-soprano one is accustomed to in the
part, her voice is small and has a soprano quality. With the
addition of Barbara Bonney in Act 2 as the young Sophie, the
leading women's voices are all sweet, unstrained, a delight to
listen to - but too much alike.
   The Marschallin, in Act 1, thinks about losing her youth. She
does this in the wondering, almost humorous way of a person
thinking about it for the first time. This is appropriate when the
singer is as young and attractive as Miss Lott. However, it doesn't
add the texture of deep human understanding that some sopranos
who've sung the Marschallin have given.
   This ``Der Rosenkavalier'' was more a musical experience than an
emotional one.
   Aage Haugland, who looked like Charles Laughton, sang Baron
Ochs. He hit the high notes in Act 1 and the low notes in Act 2,
something that not every singer of the part can do. He sounded as
though he wasn't singing full voice.
   The very stylish production, designed by Nathaniel Merrill and
Robert O'Hearn, dates from 1969. Some of the staging has been
changed; Ochs picked up Sophie after he asks her to dance and swung
her off her feet, side to side, several times. There is now more
dancing than before, much of it by Sarah Walker and Anthony
Laciura, the ``Italian intriguers.''
   Juliana Gondek, a native of Pasadena, Calif., made her Met debut
in the small part of Sophie's duenna.
   Kleiber, who lives near Munich and picks and chooses what operas
he will conduct, decided in August that he was willing to conduct
the first seven performances of ``Der Rosenkavalier.'' He also
decreed there be one, not two, dogs in the Marschallin's bedroom in
Act 1.
   Met Artistic Director James Levine, who had intended to conduct,
was able to relinquish that without breaking anybody's contract.
Levine will conduct the performances next February and March.
   In the performances of Oct. 4, 9, 17 and 20, Luciano Pavarotti
will sing the one aria by Act 1's ``Italian singer.''

   President and Barbara Bush have agreed to donate
their organs to science when they die, and the first lady has also
signed a living will.
   ``I had a dog I loved put down, because I didn't want the dog to
suffer,'' Mrs. Bush said in the Oct. 30 issue of Woman's Day. ``I
would certainly hope someone would do the same thing for me.''
   Mrs. Bush also said her husband sheds tears over ``touching,
poignant things'' but holds up in emergencies.
   ``He's not a crybaby like me, and he'd never cry during a
crisis,'' she said.
   What makes the president cry? ``When George first saw our last
child, Doro, he just put his head up against the nursery window and
had tears streaming down his face,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   The president insists on clearing the table after a meal, she
said.
   ``I married a man who is a great help at hustling dishes out
after a meal,'' she said. ``Even when we just have pickup, I grab
his plate to get it first, or he'll rinse it and put it in the
dishwasher.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Rep. Joseph Kennedy said politics mucked up his
personal life, but he never considered bailing out of public
service.
   ``Politics is a great profession - an exciting, demanding,
profession. But it takes a tremendous toll ... on your personal
life,'' Kennedy said in an interview for the syndicated TV program
``Personalities.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat and his wife, Sheila Rauch, filed for
divorce earlier this month.
   Kennedy, 38, is the oldest child of Robert Kennedy, who was
assassinated in 1968 during his bid for president. Kennedy also is
the nephew of Sen. Teddy Kennedy, D-Mass., and President Kennedy.
   Kennedy, who is seeking his third term, said, ``It was just not
something that ever dawned on me, to shun public service because of
these difficulties.''

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - Animator Ollie Johnston said he wasn't
``on'' anything when he worked on the phantasmagoric Walt Disney
classic ``Fantasia.''
   Johnston was one of the legendary ``nine old men'' who animated
Disney features from 1937 into the 1980s. He drew the centaurettes
for the Pastorale sequence of ``Fantasia,'' released in 1940 and
due out again Oct. 5.
   The cartoon interpretation of classical music was a box office
failure in the 1940s and 1950s. The turning point came in the
1960s, when young people embraced it as a psychedelic trip.
   ``People have asked what we were `on' when we made the
picture,'' Johnston laughed during a recent interview. ``We weren't
`on' anything.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ann Archer liked almost everything about
starring in the thriller ``Narrow Margin'' - but not the stunts
atop a fast-moving train.
   ``I thought there would be a stunt person doing most of it and
there would just be a close-up of me when the train was at a dead
standstill,'' she said.
   ``I questioned my whole reason for being an actress. ... I
didn't study this,'' she said in a recent interview. ``I used to
kid them that every day I felt like I was going to the dentist and
it's turning more and more into a root canal as we go along.''
   The movie opened nationwide on Friday. Miss Archer plays a
witness to a murder who is taken to Los Angeles aboard a train by a
prosecutor, portrayed by Gene Hackman.

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - Bob Newhart is so thrilled about being
picked grand marshal of the Tournament of Roses New Year's Day
parade that he doesn't mind working for free.
   ``It's a huge honor,'' Newhart said after he was chosen Tuesday.
``It's not so much me they're honoring as they are comedy and the
role it plays in our lives and how it gets us through the day.''
   The 61-year-old master of deadpan comedy will oversee the 102nd
annual parade. The theme is ``Fun and Games.''
   If he were to design a float on a comic theme, Newhart said, he
would plaster flowers over his longtime friend, Don Rickles, and
have people sit on him as he waddled down the street.
   The parade precedes the annual Rose Bowl college football game.
   The soft-spoken actor recently ended an eight-year run on the
CBS sitcom ``Newhart,'' in which he played an embattled hotelier in
a quaint Vermont town.
   He also played a Chicago psychologist in ``The Bob Newhart
Show,'' which ran on CBS from 1972 to 1978.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Two Cold-War Era Treaties to Limit Nuclear Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a decade after they were signed, two
Cold War-era treaties that limit the size of nuclear tests by the
United States and the Soviet Union have won approval from the
Senate.
   The two agreements now seem less significant than they did when
they were negotiated by Presidents Nixon and Ford, but the means of
verifying them - recently worked out by President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev - have far-reaching implications.
   The Senate voted 98-0 on Tuesday to consent to ratification of
the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty. Lawmakers used the occasion to call for the
eventual elimination of nuclear testing.
   The treaties, which limit underground explosions to 150 kilotons
or less, were delayed for years, first because of efforts to seek a
more comprehensive test ban, then by misgivings over whether they
could be adequately verified.
   The latter doubts were largely erased by a new set of
verification rules agreed to by Bush and Gorbachev on June 1 during
their Washington summit.
   Those rules, a sign of the new trust between the two former
adversaries, provide for intrusive on-site verification. Each side
may establish three seismic monitoring stations in the other's
territory.
   Soviet monitoring sites are in Newport, Wash.; Tulsa, Okla.; and
in the Black Hills of South Dakota. U.S. monitoring sites are in
the Ural Mountains, near Moscow and in Siberia.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the senior GOP member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, cautioned that the Soviets could use their
monitoring teams for spying. He urged that no inspections be
permitted until security procedures are tightened.
   Other than the verification measures, the two modest treaties
lag far beyond current arms control reality, which contemplates
massive reductions in the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals and
sharp cuts in conventional forces.
   Supporters said the new verification measures are likely to
become important precedents for the more ambitious arms control
treaties to come.
   The treaties are a followup to the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty,
which barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in
space.
   They were intended as a first step toward slowing the race to
develop ever-larger nuclear bombs. Several senators said their
approval should be the occasion to launch a new effort toward
elimination of testing.
   ``I urge the administration to take seriously the call for
further steps'' toward a phased elimination of nuclear test blasts,
said Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
noted that President Reagan pledged to begin work on eliminating
testing once the two treaties were ratified. ``That was a very
important pledge, and it now comes into play,'' Nunn said.
   At a hearing last week, Ronald F. Lehman II, director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said that process will begin
in a matter of months with a gradual lowering of the ceiling on
test yields, Nunn said.
   The treaties ran into delays after they were signed, first
because of the Carter administration's desire to seek a
comprehensive test ban rather than a limitation. The Reagan
administration then held them up because it believed the United
States would be unable to make sure the Soviets did not cheat, and
charged that Moscow had violated the ceiling on at least two dozen
occasions.
   The Threshold Test Ban Treaty puts a ceiling of 150 kilotons on
the size of weapons tests and provides detailed procedures to
ensure that the other side can accurately measure yields.
   The Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty places identical limits
on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes, such as seismic
exploration or excavation. The United States has not detonated such
a ``peaceful'' explosion since 1973, and the Soviets ceased such
blasts in 1988.
   The pact is intended primarily to ensure that large nuclear
weapons tests are not carried out under the guise of peaceful
explosions.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Bush sent to Capitol Hill a treaty to end the
45-year-old division of Germany. In it, the United States
relinquishes all rights and responsibilities over Germany it
assumed after World War II with France, Great Britain and the
Soviet Union.
   At a White House ceremony, the president called the agreement
``the culmination of more than four decades of Western resolve and
determination, from the darkest hours of the Cold War to the bright
new horizons that stretch before us.''

<HEAD>Iraq Seen Unable to Become Self-Sufficient in Grain</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will take much more than an order from
Baghdad for Iraq to boost wheat production significantly,
Agriculture Department analysts say.
   The Iraqi government this week ordered farmers to plant 80
percent of their land to wheat in an attempt to offset food
shortages caused by the international trade embargo that followed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   But USDA analysts questioned Tuesday said it will be virtually
impossible for Iraq to become self-sufficient in food grains under
the present circumstances.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, cited
Iraq's sparse rainfall, limited arable land and poor prospects for
irrigation development as limiting factors.
   ``No political structure exists that would encourage
agricultural development at the present time,'' one analyst said.
``The years of war with Iran helped stall what progress they were
making.''
   According to Iraq's agriculture ministry, as reported in the
Baath party newspaper, Al-Thawra, committees have been formed in
all provinces to oversee the country's wheat program.
   Ministry Undersecretary Abdul Sattar Hussein was reported to
have said the extra effort was needed because of the economic
blockade and that farmers should ``plant every inch of our land and
increase the production of grains, especially wheat because this is
the basic foodstuff of our people.''
   Iraq has a total land area of about 43 million hectares, or
about 106 million acres, according to USDA records. A hectare is
2.47 acres.
   More than two-thirds of Iraq is desert, wasteland or urban
areas, and only about 14.3 million acres are arable, or fit to grow
crops, according to one USDA analyst. Pasture land, which depends
greatly on seasonal rains, makes up an additional 9.9 million
acres, and irrigation is available on about 6.2 million acres.
   ``But they've got a terrible salinity problem on a lot of their
irrigated land,'' the analyst said.
   According to USDA accounting, Iraq's biggest wheat crop was 2.6
million metric tons harvested in 1972, a year of good weather and
more favorable policies in Baghdad.
   ``It drifted down from there,'' the analyst said. ``And they
need about 4 million tons of wheat a year for consumption.''
   Iraq's wheat production in 1990-91 is projected by USDA at
800,000 tons, one-fifth of the country's needs.
   About three-fourths of Iraq's food needs have been imported,
with the United States a major provider of wheat and other grain.
In the 1989-90 marketing year, Iraq was the eighth-largest U.S.
overseas market for wheat.
   The Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service said in a
recent outlook report that the Persian Gulf conflict ``could have
an adverse impact on U.S. wheat exports'' and noted that Iraq alone
accounted for more than 1 million tons of wheat last year.
   ``Kuwait itself has been a relatively small wheat market,
importing about 150,000 tons annually - about 50,000 tons from the
United States,'' the report said. ``However, Kuwait recently
exerted its influence in the world wheat market by providing credit
to Egypt.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Census Figures May Have to be Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a congressional panel
overseeing the 1990 census says release of official state
population figures may have to be delayed because too many people
are going uncounted.
   Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Post Office
subcommittee on the census, said the Census Bureau is rechecking
disputed figures and has assured that several million people will
be added to the preliminary U.S. total population count of
245,837,681.
   ``I am increasingly concerned, however, that these programs are
not designed to find the significant numbers of people who may have
been overlooked during the primary counting phases,'' Sawyer said
Tuesday at a hearing by his subcommittee.
   The lawmaker plans to introduce a bill that would delay release
of official state population counts until the commerce secretary
has adjusted the figures based on the rechecks, or determined that
no adjustment is necessary.
   That decision must be made by July 15, 1991. State population
counts were to be released by next April 1 so that state
governments would have plenty of time to redistrict before the 1991
state election season.
   The final count also will lead to congressional redistricting,
although timing is not quite so critical for that since the next
congressional election is not until 1992.
   Testimony before Sawyer's committee emphasized the problems the
Census Bureau is having counting this complex society with its
ethnic diversity, extensive travel habits, diverse living
arrangements and huge geographic areas.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said, for example, that in Monroe,
Mich., census workers apparently listed vacancies for houses whose
inhabitants were simply out of town.
   ``Michigan has a long winter, and many permanent residents are
away from home during the early spring,'' Dingell said.
   According to census reports, 389 Monroe houses and apartments
are vacant, although city officials say there are only 41 units
without residents, Dingell said.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., said census workers missed 7,000
students in dormitories on the Bloomington campus of Indiana
University.
   He said Bloomington Mayor Tomi Allison also told him that about
900 housing units in the city are missing from preliminary census
figures.
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr., R-S.C., who represents Charleston
County, said Hurricane Hugo caused many of his constituents to be
displaced and uncounted.
   ``Prior to the hurricane, the city of Charleston had an
estimated vacancy rate of 7 percent,'' said Ravenel. ``In April of
1990, after the storm, it was reported to be 11.6 percent
(according to the census),'' he said.
   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., whose district is the third poorest in
the country, said the Census Bureau didn't seem to understand the
complications of counting a predominantly poor, minority, rural
district where many citizens lack the basic education needed to
fill out forms.
   Barbara Everitt Bryant, director of the Census Bureau, said the
post-census review was finding clusters of missed housing units and
group quarters, such as dormitories.
   She said 39,000 local governments have had a chance to review
preliminary counts and identify discrepancies that will be
rechecked.
   ``We have heard some people claim the census was a disaster,''
Bryant said. ``Making such statements is at best premature, and at
worst misleading and potentially mischievous.''

<HEAD>Bill to Boost Fuel Economy Dead for Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a bill that would require sharp
increases in automobile fuel economy say they will try again next
year to get the measure passed after hitting a roadblock in the
Senate.
   The Senate refused Tuesday to limit debate on the bill, which
would have required the automakers to attain a fleet fuel economy
average of 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001. The measure then
was withdrawn from consideration.
   The vote was 57-42 in favor of invoking cloture, or limiting
debate, but 60 votes were required.
   ``The minority (of senators) won a small and shortsighted
victory,'' Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said after the vote. ``We
will be back next year.''
   The auto industry had vigorously fought the legislation,
claiming it would force them to build only small cars and lead to
the demise of the six-passenger family sedan.
   Environmentalists and the bill's sponsors disputed the claim and
argued that industry would develop technologies to increase gas
mileage and still provide a broad range of car sizes.
   Bryan said he was heartened by the fact that a majority of the
senators voted to advance the bill, although not enough to cut off
debate.
   The Senate action came as the Environmental Protection Agency
released its fuel economy statistics for 1991 model cars. The list
showed that automakers have made virtually no overall fuel
efficiency gains over the last five years. The average fuel economy
for all cars was 28.1 mpg, the same as in 1987. More than half of
the cars get less than 23 mpg, the EPA said.
   The auto industry had waged a vigorous campaign against Bryan's
legislation, which would require manufacturers to produce cars with
a company-wide average fuel economy of 35 mpg by 1995 and 40 mpg by
the year 2001. The industry argued that such advances would be
impossible to achieve without making cars dramatically smaller.
   Bryan had said earlier he was optimistic about the chances of
the bill's passage in light of the increased awareness about the
need to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. He
contended that his legislation eventually would save 2.8 million
barrels of oil a day.
   Environmentalists also had lauded the bill as the best way to
conserve energy and reduce demands for Mideast oil.
   ``Today the gas guzzlers won and they're popping the champagne
corks in (Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein's palace,'' said Daniel
Becker, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.
   Opponents, led by Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., maintained that
the tougher fuel economy standards could not be achieved unless
manufacturers stopped making a full line of family-size cars.
   Riegle argued during debate that Bryan's legislation would have
imposed an unfair $62.5 billion cost on automakers over five years
as they shiftedto complying with more stringent fuel economy
requirements.

<HEAD>Committee Chairmen Reach Accord on Deposit Insurance Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the House and Senate Banking
committees agree on key elements of a sweeping plan to revamp the
deposit insurance system, improving the chances for passage of
major banking legislation next year.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, on Tuesday introduced legislation that would
force regulators to abandon their ``too-big-to-fail'' policy of
protecting all deposits, regardless of amount, at large banks.
   His bill would impose losses on depositors with more than
$100,000 in a failed bank or savings and loan institution.
   Currently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has an unstated
policy of protecting all depositors in large institutions whose
failure they fear would ripple through the financial system. The
drawback is that this encourages depositors to put their money in
unsound institutions paying high interest rates.
   Under Riegle's bill, depositors would still be allowed to insure
all of their money by splitting it among several institutions. But
currently permitted ways of insuring more than $100,000 at a single
institution - through trust and joint accounts - would be banned.
   Riegle's bill also would force regulators to restrict the
risk-taking of ailing banks and S&amp;Ls before they become insolvent.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, has proposed similar legislation. He called Riegle's
bill ``right on target.''
   At a meeting of his committee Tuesday, Gonzalez released a study
by his staff showing the FDIC protected 99.5 percent of deposits in
all bank failures during the past five years, even though on
average only 75 percent are insured.
   In S&amp;L failures between August 1989 and June 1990, 99.97 percent
of all deposits were protected at an excess cost of $7.8 billion,
the study found.
   The agreement of the two chairmen on the fundamental issue could
pave the way for major banking legislation next year that extends
far beyond deposit insurance.
   Curbing the insurance would give lawmakers the leeway to
restructure the financial system, permitting banks to enter the
riskier but potentially more lucrative businesses of insurance and
securities underwriting.
   However, some members of the House committee and FDIC Chairman
L. William Seidman warned that it will not be a easy to get rid of
the too-big-to-fail policy.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said big depositors would shift
their money to foreign banks whose governments, one way or another,
protect their large banks from failing.
   Seidman said Riegle's bill, as written, would simply push the
job of protecting big banks from collapse from the FDIC to the
Federal Reserve, which supplies temporary advances to institutions
experiencing runs by depositors.
   If it were revised to effectively force all regulators to
abandon too-big-to-fail, it could be dangerous, he warned.
   ``That could be a very destabilizing factor in our financial
system,'' Seidman said.
   To permit modernization of the financial system without added
risk to taxpayers through deposit insurance, Seidman advocated
letting banks expand into new areas through separately capitalized
subsidiaries that would not use deposits.
   He suggested that some riskier activities already permitted to
banks also should be shifted into subsidiaries. Among these are
loans to foreign countries, corporate takeover and leveraged buyout
lending, foreign exchange trading, long-term commercial loans and
loans for land purchases.

<HEAD>Conference Committee Approves Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major civil rights bill designed to spur
minority hiring is out of a House-Senate conference committee but
under threat of a presidential veto on grounds it would lead to
quotas.
   ``We are optimistic that the president will approve the action
of the Congress,'' Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said Tuesday
after lawmakers reached a compromise between slightly differing
House and Senate versions.
   But other lawmakers indicated it was far from certain that
President Bush would sign such a measure. ``The president has a
historic choice to make,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Five Supreme Court decisions last year would be effectively
negated by the bill, which is the top item on the civil rights
movement's legislative agenda this year.
   The bill's features range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to measures aimed at locking in court-approved
fair-hiring plans.
   The main dispute has been over provisions designed to make it
easier for minorities to win job discrimination suits.
   Administration officials contend that these provisions are so
skewed against employers that companies would seek employment
practices that would automatically provide them with an airtight
defense in the event of a suit.
   And that would mean hiring quotas, say the administration and
business groups that oppose the legislation.
   Civil rights forces scoff at that notion, saying the bill would
basically restore the law to what it was before last year's Supreme
Court decision in a case involving an Alaskan salmon cannery.
   The bill passed by the House was for the most part adopted by
the conference committee as well. The only major departure was a
provision placing a cap on punitive damages that could be awarded
in civil rights suits.
   The cap would be either $150,000 or the total of compensatory
damages plus any lost pay, whichever was larger.
   The House had approved a cap of either $500,000 or the total of
compensatory damages, whichever was larger. There was no cap in the
Senate bill.
   Under the House version, the cap would have applied only to
employers with 100 or fewer workers. Larger companies would have
been vulnerable to unlimited punitive damages. The conference
committee placed all companies under the cap.
   The vote on the cap provision was 9-7, with Republicans voting
against the measure.

<HEAD>Millions Suffer From Sleep Disorders That Cause Accidents, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sleep disorders affect millions of Americans,
often causing accidents and ruining careers, but they usually are
ignored by physicians and victims may go years without treatment.
   In a hearing on Capitol Hill of the National Commission on Sleep
Disorders Research, victims and experts said Tuesday that more
attention must be paid to the suite of sleep ailments that can
cripple lives, end marriages, disrupt careers and even cause death.
   ``The need for sleep research is virtually ignored,'' said
William C. Dement, chairman of the commission and a medical
professor at Stanford University. ``The house of research does not
have a bedroom.''
   Sleep disorders range from an irresistible urge to sleep - an
ailment called narcolepsy - to insomnia, which is the inability to
achieve adequate or restful sleep. Other problems include
``restless leg syndrome,'' the jerking and twitching of the lower
limbs during sleep; snoring, which may be habitual for almost half
of all adults, and sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing stops
and restarts through the night, disturbing rest and perhaps causing
death in some victims.
   People also suffer from sleep disorders caused by travel and
work schedules that disturb the natural rest-wake cycle. Sleep
cycle changes may pose a particular hazard in modern society, the
experts said.
   David Dinges, a University of Pennsylvania psychologist, said
that poor sleep and the resulting lack of alertness is becoming a
major element in industrial accidents, particularly for shift
workers, jet travelers who cross many time zones and those working
too many hours.
   ``Inadequate sleep is a major cause of human error, and at least
as important as drugs, alcohol and equipment failure'' in workplace
accidents, he said.
   Dinges said airplanes, ships, factories and power plants all are
becoming increasingly automated, which means humans must sit and
alertly monitor what the machines are doing.
   ``That's a task we do poorly after missing some sleep,
especially if we have to work at night,'' he said.
   Dinges said industry and the military are beginning to recognize
the need to shift work hours to allow for the human need to adjust
sleep cycles to new schedules.
   He said that the use of bright lights to readjust sleep cycles
``shows promise.'' Allowing pilots to nap in the cockpit has been
shown useful in keeping them alert during long transoceanic
flights, he said. But other proposed treatments, such as special
diets, have proven useless in treating the fatigue of jet lag and
night shift work.
   Sufferers of narcolepsy testified that they must constantly
fight the tendency to suddenly drop off to sleep, often at the very
worst of times.
   Lori Highland of Ashford, Wash., said she has spent her life
``in a haze of sleepiness.''
   ``My life is haunted by this,'' she said. ``I can't drive. I
have been hospitalized repeatedly for injuries'' that occur when
she collapses suddenly into sleep.
   Mrs. Highland said that powerful emotions, such as anger,
laughter or fear, will bring on cataplexy, a sudden muscle weakness
that causes a victim to collapse and be unable to move.
   She said that her grandfather had similar symptoms, as did her
mother and now her young daughter.
   ``This has affected four generations,'' said Mrs. Highland. ``My
mother was labeled a `ne'er do well' because she couldn't stay
awake long enough to do her housework.''
   She said doctors could not identify her problem for years and
that she tried many different treatments, all unsuccessful. Mrs.
Highland said she was being prepared for surgery, to search for
what was thought to be a brain tumor, when a doctor who had taken a
recent seminar on sleep disorders diagnosed her disorder.
   Allen Music of Silver Spring, Md., said he suffers from sleep
apnea, which destroys normal sleep and keeps him in a state of
``uncontrolled drowsiness.''
   Before his illness was diagnosed, Music said he routinely drove
a car and often would awaken to find the vehicle wrecked because he
had fallen asleep at the wheel. To make even a short trip, Music
said he learned that he had to take a nap before he left, stop en
route and nap, and then nap when he arrived.
   Gerald Schefey, a former Methodist minister now in his 50s, said
he had to retire on disability because sleep apnea pushed him to
the point that he was falling asleep while counseling parishioners
or while driving.
   ``Apnea is not considered a disabling disorder, but it is,'' he
said.
   Dement and other experts said the causes of narcolepsy are not
known and there is virtually no treatment for the ailment. Few
patients respond to drugs, they said.
   Sleep apnea is now treated with surgery, which works about half
the time, and with a sleep mask that feeds oxygen at a pressure
that keeps airways from sagging closed, said Dr. Philip Smith of
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

   Twelve-year-old Sandy Rodriguez resisted to the end the death
that had stalked her since Christmas.
   When it took her in its clutches early Tuesday at her Elizabeth,
N.J., home, she enlisted her nurse to help her from her deathbed
and drive her to a hospital chapel.
   ``Dear God. This is Sandy,'' she pleaded aloud. ``Please help
me, God. Help me, please. I don't want to hurt anymore. I'm
scared.''
   Almost every part of her body, from her head to her
toothpick-thin legs, had been hurting from AIDS. The virus had
apparently slipped into her body through a transfusion needed when
she was born prematurely, her family says.
   Sandy, who succumbed later on Tuesday, was among the nearly
2,500 children under 13 who have contracted AIDS in the United
States since the epidemic began. More than half those children have
died.
   In the days before her death, those who loved Sandy were unable
to hold her because her 40-pound body and 4-foot-5 frame were so
brittle and so black and blue with bruises caused by the slightest
touch.
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, she prayed in the chapel to realize a child's
dreams: to walk out of her bed without the pain in her belly and
legs, to go back to school and her friends, to have another party
like the big barbecue the aunt who raised her gave for her 12th
birthday on May 1, and to see New Kids on the Block.
   Her No. 1 wish was to fly to Puerto Rico to visit her
grandmother, Minga, and to see the clouds from the plane.
   She had fought to the very end to fulfill that wish, which
seemed to be within reach. Angel Pena, of Allendale, N.J., an
account executive for an electronics company, read of Sandy's
ill-fortune two weeks ago and visited her. He said he was helping
arrange the trip for her and her aunt. Instead, Sandy flies to
Puerto Rico in death for burial there.
   ``I don't want to die,'' her nurse, Holly Popovich, who took her
to the chapel, heard her pray from her wheelchair. ``I want to
live.''
   ``I think she knew all weekend,'' said Ms. Popovich. ``She
didn't want to sleep. She was afraid to fall asleep.''
   Sandy had told Ms. Popovich, ``You take me for a ride in your
car. I want to go to church. I want to talk to God. I want to
pray.''
   On her way out of the chapel, she blessed herself with holy
water and took some for her aunt, Carmen Candelaria, whom she
called her mother. Mrs. Candelaria took Sandy from her own sister
when she was born because the sister was unable to care for her.
   Sandy's mother died two years ago after mixing Valium and
alcohol at a party, Mrs. Candelaria said. She said she knows
nothing about Sandy's father. Her own husband, the man Sandy called
her father, was killed when she was 7 in a holdup in Puerto Rico,
where the family lived for five years.
   Fearing death, Sandy stalled it.
   After leaving the chapel, she insisted on going to an all-night
supermarket, where she bought candy, gum and a Mickey Mouse book.
   Upon returning home shortly after 5 a.m., she blessed her aunt
with the holy water. ``Mommy, I love you,'' she said.
   They kissed. Tears came to Mrs. Candelaria.
   ``Don't cry, Mommy,'' Sandy implored her.
   ``I just want you to lie down and sleep,'' Mrs. Candelaria told
her.
   ``No, Mom. I just want to do some coloring. Put the bed up. Give
me some crayons and a book.''
   Mrs. Candelaria put the crayons and book on the bed next to
Sandy. The girl loved to color and had painted many pictures for
her day nurse, Doreen Small, to make amends for taking out her
anger on her.
   She was too weak to use the crayons. She called out the names of
friends absent, her final roll call of goodbyes: ``Glissette,'' her
sister, ``Lues,'' her cousin, ``Doreen,'' her nurse, ``Wanda,'' her
friend.
   Shortly after 9 a.m., dressed in a New Kids on the Block
T-shirt, she slipped away to a place where, she had told a recent
visitor, everything is beautiful.
   ``You go to God, go to Jesus in a big place where he lives,''
she had said. ``My father is in there. Everyone who dies goes
there. ... I can walk in there. No pain in my stomach, no pain in
my knee and I walk again.''

   Elizabeth Taylor has filed a $20 million
libel suit against the National Enquirer, claiming the supermarket
tabloid falsely labeled her a heavy drinker with a disfiguring
disease.
   The Superior Court lawsuit filed Tuesday said the actress was
hospitalized with near-fatal pneumonia when a front-page headline
June 12 screamed: ``Liz Docs Furious. She's Boozing it Up in the
Hopital.''
   The lawsuit also cited a Jan. 19 article headlined: ``Liz's
Beautiful Face Ravaged by Killer Disease. Doctors Order Suicide
Watch After They Finally Diagnose the Mystery Illness.''
   The lawsuit said that story suggested Miss Taylor had lupus, a
destructive skin condition.
   Miss Taylor claimed the Enquirer was notified about inaccuracies
in its stories and headlines before publication.
   Iain Calder, National Enquirer editor and president, wasn't in
the office late Tuesday at the newspaper's Lantana, Fla.,
headquarters, a receptionist said.
   Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, did not immediately return
calls after business hours Tuesday.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and painkillers. She has been treated for alcohol
and drug abuse.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is trying to
turn Americans against President Bush, saying he is leading the
world to ``the edge of a bottomless abyss.''
   ``Bush wants to bring back the sorrows of America and humanity
by repeating the Vietnam experience, only this time in a more
radical manner and more violent and more casualties,'' Saddam said
in an address to Americans.
   Saddam taped the 75-minute message in Baghdad last week, and it
was delivered in Washington on Tuesday. Excerpts were aired on the
major networks, and CNN decided to show the entire message early
today.
   ``Bush, ladies and gentlemen, pushes your children to a war
which has no human value whatsoever, it has no significance except
fatal arrogance ... which says to those who are weak - obey - and
they obey,'' Saddam said.
   Wearing a dark suit rather than the military uniform he often
favors, Saddam warned that if Bush were to launch war against Iraq,
``it would not be up to him to end it.''
   Saddam taped his address in response to an eight-minute message
by Bush that was broadcast unedited on state-run Iraqi television
10 days ago. Bush too warned Iraqis that their president had
brought them to the brink of war.
   Sitting at his desk with an Iraqi flag at his side, Saddam said
he wanted Americans to know the truth about Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
and occupation of Kuwait.
   His rambling speech was peppered with frequent references to
Allah and his teachings, and accused Bush of lacking faith in God.
Saddam described Bush as ``promoting a form of neo-Nazism'' by
viewing himself as leader of the free world.
   He made frequent reference to Israel's occupation of Arab lands
and its presence in ``al-Quds,'' or Jerusalem, one of Islam's
holiest sites.
   Saddam spoke in Arabic. His remarks were translated with English
subtitles supplied by Iraqi authorities.
   Bush is ``placing you in a critically embarrassing situation ...
on the edge of a bottomless abyss,'' by defending undemocratic
governments like those of Kuwait, Saddam said.
   Although Bush told the Iraqi people his administration had no
quarrel with them, Saddam said, ``We have evidence that President
Bush was himself involved in the Iran-gate or Iran-Contra
conspiracy against Iraq in 1986 when he was Reagan's vice
president.''
   As vice president, Bush was privy to the Reagan administration's
decision to sell weapons to Iran - which was at war with Iraq - in
an effort to win freedom for American hostages held by pro-Iranian
radicals in Lebanon.
   Congress, too, was involved in a conspiracy against Iraq long
before the Aug. 2 invasion, Saddam said. Lawmakers wanted to impose
economic sanctions against his country, under the influence of the
powerful ``Zionist'' lobby of Israel's supporters, he said.
   He challenged Bush, again, to an international television
debate, adding, ``If Bush has truth on his side, why should he
evade debate?''
   Iraq desires peace, but one that is based on a broad resolution
of all the region's problems, Saddam said. He repeated his call for
a peace conference to resolve Israel's 23-year occupation of Arab
lands, Syria's 14-year occupation of Lebanon, and Iraq's claims to
Kuwait.
   Kuwait, he said, was part of Iraq under the Ottoman Empire until
the British took control of the country in 1899. He called for
``the return of Kuwait to the fold of Iraq, its motherland from
which it was long severed, and usurped, like an infant separated
from its mother.''
   He repeatedly attacked the credibility and integrity of the
al-Sabah family which ruled Kuwait for nearly 250 years until the
invasion.
   Kuwait's leaders were ``busy amassing wealth and women,'' he
said. So profligate were the rulers, that a Kuwaiti prince once
wanted to marry a young woman only to find out she was his
daughter, Saddam said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders are trying to revive a
major crime bill that conservatives derailed in a protest over
death penalty provisions they said are too weak.
   ``This is a travesty,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
said Tuesday as he and other conservatives fought the measure on
the House floor. They said it needed stricter provisions to end
excessive delays in carrying out death sentences.
   The conservatives, who usually lack enough support to win such
fights in Democratic-controlled House, managed to defeat, 258-166,
a rule that would have barred the House from considering a tighter
version of the death penalty provision.
   The vote forced Democratic leaders to pull the bill from the
floor after only brief debate and search for a new procedure that
would withstand any such attack.
   It was a bad day on the anti-crime issue for House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash. He also came under fire from police lobbying
groups over a separate provision barring consideration of an
amendment to increase controls on handguns.
   The overall anti-crime package calls for the death penalty for
10 federal crimes, ranging from assassination of the president to
espionage. It would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed search warrants if police had acted ``in good faith.''
   A major controversy is brewing over ``habeas corpus'' provisions
designed to end delays of a decade or more in carrying out
executions while the condemned file repeated appeals claiming they
were treated in an unconstitutional manner.
   The bill is designed to limit death row inmates to one such
petition in many cases to be filed no later than one year after
their other appeals are exhausted. The Bush administration and
conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., say however that
it needs to be far stronger.
   As it stands, the bill would ``reduce the degree of finality of
convictions by weakening procedures relating to habeas corpus,''
the administration said in a statement Tuesday.
   The administration also called for approval of warrantless
searches if police acted in good faith and it attacked a provision
of the House bill that would enable convicts to use racial
statistics as a basis for appealing death sentences.
   Defenders of the bill said it could be improved but that it did
provide not only powerful weapons for police in the war against
crime but ones that could win approval on Capitol Hill.
   ``It puts more arrows in the quiver of law enforcement,'' said
Rep. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky. But there were many Democratic
defectors.
   Meanwhile, police groups said at a news conference that controls
on semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police
are to be effective in fighting crime.
   ``Should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers and
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of Congress before we
pass sensible gun legislation?'' asked Fraternal Order of Police
leader Dewey Stokes.
   The police groups criticized a Rules Committee decision Monday
barring consideration of an amendment that would require a
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   ``Right now, Speaker Foley is not permitting the (amendment) to
come to a vote on the floor of the House, so who else can we
blame?'' Stokes said.
   Foley's spokesman, Jeff Biggs, noted the House Judiciary
Committee had approved the anti-crime package and the handgun bill
as separate measures and said the speaker often goes along with the
wishes of committee chairmen. He also said that Foley had not ruled
out consideration of the gun bill as a separate item.

   An Agriculture Department official rejected a
call by the National Academy of Sciences for an overhaul of the
nation's critically important agricultural seed collection system.
   The academy found that nearly half the seed samples in the
nation's principal collection are in danger and that only a new,
centralized administration can correct the deficiencies that led to
that.
   ``We think the system has worked very, very well,'' countered
Edward Knipling, deputy administrator of the USDA's Agricultural
Research Service.
   He said Tuesday he didn't think stronger, centralized management
of the nation's scattered seed banks and seed laboratories was
possible.
   The genes contained in the 232,210 samples in the National Seed
Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo., the nation's largest
collection, have been used to develop new varieties of corn, wheat
and other important crops.
   Those new varieties have contributed to the tripling of corn
yields and other huge gains in American agricultural productivity
in recent decades, the study said.
   Those gains have in turn boosted the nation's economy. Cash
receipts from U.S. crops were $72.6 billion in 1988, up $10.7
billion from the year before, the study said.
   ``Managing genetic resources, therefore, is a strategic
necessity for the United States,'' the academy study said.
   But the study found that 45 percent of the seed samples in the
National Seed Storage Laboratory contained fewer than 550 seeds.
That means they are in danger of vanishing as the seeds age and
die.
   Such samples may contain irreplaceable genetic traits. But the
laboratory does not have the resources to regenerate those samples
or increase their size by growing them to produce more seeds, the
study said.
   ``Regeneration of these samples is urgently needed,'' the study
said.
   Many of the study's conclusions echo the findings of a series
last year by The Associated Press that concluded that thousands of
irreplaceable crop seeds are dead or dying in an antiquated,
underfunded federal seed bank.
   Peter Day of Rutgers University in New Jersey, chairman of the
academy committee that conducted the study, said that Henry L.
Shands, who heads the National Plant Germplasm System, is
``extremely capable'' but appears to have little or no authority.
   ``He has to depend on the agreement of large numbers of other
committees in order to get anything done,'' Day said. ``It's a very
difficult situation.''
   Shands, of the Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville, Md.,
was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.
   Genetic materials used in breeding are referred to as
``germplasm.''
   The National Seed Storage Laboratory is the cornerstone of a
network of perhaps 20 seed collections and laboratories around the
country, without a central administration, the report said.
   ``The great strategic importance of plant genetic resources
requires that the system be administered centrally, at the national
level,'' the study said.
   The study said it will be ``very difficult, if not impossible,
for the system to function properly without a major overhaul in its
structure and administrative procedures.''
   Other recommendations in the study included the appropriation of
more money to regenerate seeds and the expansion of the National
Seed Storage Laboratory.

   Gay and Arab. They are two words rarely spoken
in the same breath, and almost never in the conservative Middle
East, but Ramzi Zakharia hopes to change that.
   A year ago, Zakharia founded the Gay and Lesbian Arabic Society
and discovered other Arab-Americans in the homosexual community who
wanted to define a distinct gay Arabic identity.
   ``The result was very positive. A lot of people wrote, `Well,
it's about time,''' Zakharia says.
   Zakharia rented a post office box, started a newsletter and
began to hold monthly meetings at people's houses around
Washington. Today, there are chapters in San Francisco, Detroit,
Los Angeles and New York, as well as a scattering of contacts in
Middle Eastern countries, including Lebanon, Morocco, Egypt and
Yemen.
   Zakharia estimates total membership at about 400, and says gay
Arabs in London and Paris are talking about organizing chapters as
well.
   The groups are both social and political in focus, with an eye
toward changing the ingrained Middle Eastern attitude that
homosexuality is ``a Western problem'' as well as Western
prejudices against Arabs, Zakharia said in a recent interview.
   ``There are so many negative stereotypes of Arabs, even in the
gay community,'' he said. ``Ever since we started the association,
we have gotten the most bizarre and sometimes hilarious letters.''
   Some people have written looking for ``young dark men in white
turbans ready to offer 1,001-night orgies,'' he said. Others think
all Arabs are oil-rich sheiks who throw lavish parties.
   Zakharia, dressed in blue jeans and a T-shirt, belies either
stereotype. He is 26, a computer worker at the World Wildlife Fund.
   Recent events in the Middle East have galvanized Arab-Americans,
Zakharia said, and gay Arab-Americans have been no exception. The
Intifada uprising in the occupied West Bank and Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait have overshadowed some of the other interests of the Gay and
Lesbian Arabic Society, he said.
   ``The Palestine issue unites everyone,'' he said. ``About 90
percent of Arab-American activism has centered around the Palestine
question.''
   Zakharia, a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon, came to the
United States in 1982 to attend college. He first tried school in
West Virginia, ``but that was a little too rural for me,'' he said.
   So he transferred to East Tennessee State University, where he
studied broadcasting. After graduating, he moved to Washington and
became active in Arab-American political causes. Only later did he
come out as a gay man, he said.
   ``There isn't really any `coming out' (in the Middle East)
because there isn't a lifestyle per se. Here, there's a lot of
lifestyle, and organizations to handle our needs,'' Zakharia said.
   In Arabic countries, he said, men meet each other at certain
restaurants or cafes, but there is nothing overtly ``gay.''
   Nevertheless, meeting men for sexual encounters ``is very
available,'' he said. ``You can sleep with men, but you can't fall
in love with them. Falling in love with them is the bad part.''
   The GLAS newsletters voice a common theme of creating and
promoting an Arabic gay identity, distinct from the American gay
identity.
   ``That's an issue that comes up a lot, people asking, `Why do
you sound and why do you seem so Americanized?''' Zakharia said.
``Well, that's the only example we have.''
   One gay Arab who has been corresponding with the society from
Beirut complained that the group was too free and open: ``You have
to keep in mind that if you want to have Middle Eastern members,
secrecy must be No. 1 on your agenda.''
   The man, who begged that his identity be shielded, said he would
continue to contribute to the newsletter and declared himself ``a
militant supporter of your movement, and a passionate one.'' But he
added:
   ``As for establishing a chapter here, that is out of the
question. I don't even know gay people here in Beirut. You see, I'm
a student here and I keep a low profile. My gay friends are militia
men who are uneducated and wouldn't care less for a gay movement.''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Amendment Permitting Abortion Counseling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted to nullify administration
rules that prohibit federally supported family-planning clinics
from offering abortion counseling or information.
   By a vote of 63-35 Tuesday night, the Senate approved an
amendment requiring the clinics to provide ``information and
counseling concerning all legal and medical options'' to pregnant
women who ask for it, including ``pregnancy termination.''
   The Department of Health and Human Services issued the
no-counseling rules in 1988 during the Reagan administration and
the Bush administration continued them. They have been debated by
the opposing sides of the abortion issue and legal challenges are
pending before the Supreme Court.
   The clinics, many of which are operated by Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, receive federal money to provide health care
and family planning services for the poor.
   The amendment was added to a Senate bill that extends the life
of the family planning program, established 20 years ago by Title X
of the Public Health Service Act.
   The clinics would still be prohibited from using federal money
to perform abortions.
   The Senate rejected, 58-34, an administration proposal to scrap
the program and replace it with block grants to the states, a move
that would have handed the issue to each of the states.
   Other amendments to the bill were pending.
   Opponents of abortion opposed the amendment reversing the
administration's regulation, arguing that the federal government
should not encourage abortions or make them more available.
   ``Most Americans do not want their tax dollars used in any way
to facilitate abortions,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Advocates of abortion rights argued that the regulatory ban
discriminated against poor women, preventing them from having the
same information that women who could afford their own doctor would
receive. They said the clinics would not encourage abortions.
   ``Whether it's abstinence, adoption or abortion, I believe young
people have a right to know,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
   Since enactment in 1970, Title X has prohibited aid from going
to ``programs where abortion is a method of family planning.''
Until 1988 that was interpreted as barring the use of federal funds
to pay for abortions. That year, HHS adopted a broader
interpretation that federal money couldn't go to family planning
programs that provide abortion counseling and referral.
   The action touched off a series of lawsuits, and federal appeals
courts have delivered conflicting rulings. One of the cases is
scheduled for argument before the Supreme Court in its October
term.
   ``Why not let the court make this decision, because it's
probably going to have to in the end anyway,'' Hatch said.

<TEXT>
   The man who raised nearly $4 million for Francis
Bellotti's Democratic gubernatorial bid is jumping to the campaign
of GOP nominee William Weld.
   Peter Berlandi said he would bring more fund-raising muscle to
Weld, following a primary that was declared by a state agency
Tuesday to be the most expensive in state history. The five
candidates spent $12.4 million starting on Jan. 1, 1989.
   Berlandi, who described himself as a strong believer in the
Democratic Party, said he was taking the move because Weld and
Bellotti possess the same qualities of ``courage, creativity and
integrity.''
   ``I am not here to change my party affiliation,'' he said.
   But the move reflected a further shift in political lines in the
governor's race. On Monday, former Democratic Gov. Edward J. King,
who switched to the Republican Party, said he would support
Democratic nominee John Silber. King now lives in Florida.
   Weld, who has taken progressive stances on several social
issues, said he expected more Democrats would come to his side.
   Berlandi said he does not share Weld's support for the Citizens
for Limited Taxation petition that would roll back taxes and fees.
But he said Weld could do a better job managing the state's
finances than Silber, who is on leave as president of Boston
University.

   Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider is
losing ground to Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell, according to a new
Brown University poll.
   And Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, is 42 points behind
Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, says the poll. DiPrete, who wants a
fifth term, trailed Sundlun 66 percent to 24 percent, with 10
percent undecided.
   Pell, who seeks a sixth term, led Miss Schneider 58 percent to
35 percent, with 7 percent undecided. A Brown survey in July had
Pell leading 51 percent to 36 percent, with 13 percent undecided.
   The Sept. 16-19 telephone survey included 414 likely Rhode
Island voters. There is one chance in 20 the results could be
skewed by more than 5 percentage points either way.
   Schneider's deputy campaign manager, Robert J. Rendine, called
the results ``way out of whack.'' He countered with a Sept. 13-18
telephone poll showing Pell ahead 49 percent to 40 percent, with 11
percent undecided or refusing to answer. With 601 likely voters,
the error margin was 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Black Church Endorses Campbell Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The predominantly black African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church endorsed Gov. Carroll Campbell's re-election
bid.
   The church's announcement meant that for the second time in a
week, a black organization has spurned Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Theo Mitchell, who is black, in favor of Campbell, a
white Republican.
   Last week, the South Carolina Conference of Black Mayors
endorsed Campbell.
   Bishop Richard L. Fisher of the AME-Zion's Palmetto Conference
said Tuesday that Campbell is ``one of the brightest stars in the
political horizon.''
   Fisher said the endorsement should not be interpreted as a
rejection of Mitchell. ``It's a bit of pragmatism on our part, and
a bit of cynicism. I don't believe the Democratic Party in this
state is ready to support a black governor,'' Fisher said.
   The bishop also said that while he and Campbell have had
frequent contact in the past few years, ``We've not heard from
Senator Mitchell ... I don't know anything about the Mitchell
campaign.''
   Asked what party he belonged to, Fisher said, ``I'm a
Republican, I guess.''
   Blacks should not feel that just because Mitchell is black, they
should have to vote for him, Fisher said. ``The black community is
growing up,'' Fisher said.

   For years, the World Bank group has been the
major source of loans and expertise to stimulate economic
development in poor, mostly tropical countries of Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
   Now the bank and the related International Monetary Fund find
themselves at the center of the action in a cooler part of the
world - nations of the former Soviet bloc in central and eastern
Europe.
   ``We are bringing to Europe what we have been doing in Africa,
the Caribbean and so forth,'' said Douglas Gustafson, director of
investments for Europe and the Middle East of the group's private
sector branch, the International Finance Corp.
   Currently, the spotlight is on privatization of large-scale
government enterprise, something Gustavson described as ``totally
uncharted territory.''
   Dramatizing the changes, Czechoslovakia, one of the 22 founding
countries of the World Bank group at Bretton Woods, N.H., at the
end of World War II, rejoined last week - 36 years after its exit
was forced by the communist takeover.
   Prague seeks credits to support drastic price and currency
reforms planned for the end of 1990 and technical assistance for
plans to privatize about 70 percent of its state-controlled
industry. It will use such techniques as distribution of shares to
the public and, perhaps, an IFC-designed mutual fund.
   Depending on the strength and quality of its reforms, newly
democratic Czechoslovakia could draw $300 million to $500 million a
year of the $11 billion the World Bank may lend Central and Eastern
European countries in the coming three years, said bank department
director Eugenio F. Lari.
   The World Bank anticipates lending Poland about $800 million a
year, Hungary about $400 million and Yugoslavia $600 million to
$700 million, Lari told reporters.
   Hungary, in the forefront of economic reform, has been allocated
$2.3 billion and Poland $1 billion worth of World Bank credit since
becoming bank members in 1982 and 1986, respectively. They also
have received assistance in such matters as organizing stock
exchanges and modernizing banking.
   Post-communist Bulgaria becomes the 153rd World Bank member on
Tuesday.
   Soviet finance officials are guests at the annual World Bank-IMF
meeting here as scores of experts study the Soviet economy in
preparation for the Soviet Union's expected accession to the bank
group.
   The Supreme Soviet in Moscow voted Monday to abandon 70 years of
communist economics and move toward a market economy, in what some
delegates at the annual meetings termed ``a second Russian
revolution.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told fellow bank governors
Monday that the international lending agencies must adjust their
operations to emphasize development of the private sector rather
than strengthening of government enterprises.
   But Gustavson said the actual privatization process would
require experimentation. ``We do not have a cookbook solution'' to
reversing the balance from 90 percent state ownership and 10
percent private to 10-90, he said.
   Nations until recently under communist rule want to privatize
but ``there's an underlying sensitivity about ... the disquieting
prospect of selling out cheaply to foreign investors,'' said
Gustavson, an American who has worked in Africa for the governments
of Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
   ``When the Hungarians started spontaneous privatization, there
were indeed some very sweetheart (concessional) deals done,'' he
continued. ``The Hungarians observed it and put the brakes on,
slowing the process.''
   Gustavson said history may show the best solution to be
Czechoslovakia's plan to distribute shares of state-owned property
to its own citizens in the form of free or low-cost vouchers not
transferable to foreigners until a later stage of reform.

   Following is the official English-language
version of the air embargo Resolution 670, adopted 14-1 Tuesday by
the U.N. Security Council:
   The Security Council:
   Reaffirming its resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666 and
667, condemning the continued Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, its
failure to rescind its actions and end its purported annexation and
its holding of third State nationals against their will, in
flagrant violation of resolutions 660, 662, 664 and 667 and of
international humanitarian law;
   Condemning further the treatment by Iraqi forces of Kuwaiti
nationals, including measures to force them to leave their own land
and mistreatment by Iraqi forces of persons and property in Kuwait
in violation of international law;
   Noting with grave concern the persistent attempts to evade the
measures laid down in Resolution 661;
   Further noting that a number of states have limited the number
of Iraqi diplomatic and consular officials in their countries and
that others are proposing to do so;
   Determined to ensure by all necessary means the strict and
complete application of the measures laid down in Resolution 661;
   Determined to ensure respect for its decisions and the
provisions of Articles 25 and 48 of the Charter of the United
Nations;
   Affirming that any acts of the Government of Iraq which are
contrary to the above-mentioned resolutions or to Articles 25 or 48
or the Charter of the United Nations, such as Decree No. 377 of the
Revolution Command Council of Iraq of 16 September 1990, are null
and void;
   Reaffirming its determination to ensure compliance with Security
Council resolutions by maximum use of political and diplomatic
means;
   Welcoming the secretary-general's use of his good offices to
advance a peaceful solution based on the relevant Security Council
resolutions and noting with appreciation his efforts to this end;
   Underlining to the Government of Iraq that its continued failure
to comply with the terms of resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 666 and
667 could lead to further action by the Council under the Charter
of the United Nations, including under Chapter VII, with
potentially severe consequences;
   Recalling the provisions of Article 103 of the Charter of the
United Naitons;
   Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations:
   1. Calls upon all States to carry out their obligations to
ensure strict and complete compliance with Resolution 661 and in
particular paragrpahs 3,4 and 5 thereof;
   2. Confirms that Resolution 661 applies to all means of
transport, including aircraft;
   3. Decides that all States, notwithstanding the existence of any
rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any international
agrement of any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted before the date of the present resolution, shall deny
permission to any aircraft to take off from their territory if the
aircraft would carry any cargo to or from Iraq or Kuwait other than
food in humanitarian circumstances, subject to authorization by the
Council or the Committee established by Resolution 661 and in
accordance with Resolution 666, or supplies intended strictly for
medical purposes or solely for UNIIMOG (the Iran-Iraq peacekeeping
group);
   4. Decides further that all States shall deny permission to any
aircraft destined to land in Iraq or Kuwait, whatever its state of
registration, to overfly its territory unless:
   a. the aircraft lands at an airfield designated by that State
outside Iraq or Kuwait in order to permit its inspection to ensure
that there is no cargo on board in violation of Resolution 661 or
the present resolution, and for this purpose the aircraft may be
detained for as long as necessary; or
   b. the particular flight has been approved by the Committee
established by Resolution 661; or
   c. the flight is certified by the United Nations as solely for
the purposes of UNIIMOG;
   5. Decides that each State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure that any aircraft registered in its territory or operated by
an operator who has his principal place of business or permanent
residence in its territory complies with the provisions of
Resolution 661 and the present resolution;
   6. Decides further that all States shall notify in a timely
fashion the (sanctions) Committee established by Resolution 661 of
any flight between its territory and Iraq or Kuwait to which the
requirement to land in paragraph 4 above does not apply, and the
purpose for such a flight;
   7. Calls upon all States to cooperate in taking such measures as
may be necessary, consistent with international law, including the
Chicago Convention, to ensure the effective implementation of the
provisions of Resolution 661 or the present resolution;
   8. Calls upon all States to detain any ships of Iraqi registry

established under Resolution 661 regarding those assets;
   10. Calls upon all States to provide the Committee established
by Resolution 661 information regarding the action taken by them to
implement the provisions laid down in the present resolution;

   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the
Security Council has passed nine resolutions condemning Baghdad:
   Aug. 3 - The Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion
and demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's
troops. Yemen, the only Arab member of the council, abstained on
Resolution 660.
   Aug. 6 - The Council voted 13-0 to order a trade and financial
embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Cuba and Yemen abstained on
Resolution 661.
   Aug. 9 - The Council voted 15-0 to declare Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait null and void in international law in Resolution 662.
   Aug. 18 - The Council voted 15-0 to demand that Iraq free all
detained foreigners, in Resolution 664.
   Aug. 25 - The Council voted 13-0 to give the United States and
other naval powers the right to enforce the economic embargo
against Iraq and Kuwait by halting their shipping. Cuba and Yemen
abstained on Resolution 665.
   Sept. 13 - The Council voted 13-2 to allow humanitarian food aid
into Iraq or Kuwait ``to relieve human suffering,'' and said only
the council could decide when those circumstances exist. Cuba and
Yemen opposed Resolution 666.
   Sept. 16 - The Council voted 15-0 to condemn Iraq's aggressive
acts against diplomatic missions in Kuwait, including the abduction
of foreigners who were in the buildings, in adopting Resolution
667.
   Sept. 24 - The Council voted 15-0 to stress that only its
Sanctions Committee has the power to permit food, medicine or other
humanitarian aid to be sent into Iraq or occupied Kuwait, in
adopting Resolution 669.
   Sept. 25 - The Council voted 14-1 to expand its economic embargo
to include air traffic in or out of Iraq and Kuwait, except for
cargos of humanitarian aid specifically authorized by its Sanctions
Committee. It also calls on U.N. member nations to detain any Iraqi
ships that may be used to break the naval embargo. Cuba voted
against Resolution 670.

<HEAD>Calif. Contribution Limits Struck Down; Fund-Raising Free-For-All?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge struck down campaign
contribution limits that California voters approved in 1988. A
state election official warned against a ``fund-raising frenzy''
before the Nov. 6 election.
   A spokesman for the Republican gubernatorial candidate, U.S.
Sen. Pete Wilson, challenged Democratic candidate Dianne Feinstein,
the former San Francisco mayor, to join him in voluntarily adhering
to the old limits.
   But the Wilson spokesman, Bill Livingstone, wouldn't commit the
candidate to the voluntary limit. A Feinstein spokeswoman, Dee Dee
Myers, said the ruling may give Feinstein a chance to chip away at
Wilson's fund-raising lead.
   ``If a law is overturned, I don't know that we will feel
compelled to abide by it,'' she said.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled Tuesday that the
limits unfairly help incumbents. The limits affect campaigns for
governor, other statewide offices and some local posts.
   Two state legislators who co-sponsored the limits said they
would appeal the decision. The state Fair Political Practices
Commission, a political watchdog agency, said it would ask Karlton
to stay his ruling.
   Commission Chairman John Larson warned candidates not to start a
``fund-raising frenzy.''
   Karlton's ruling invalidated Proposition 73, which, among other
things, limits individuals to a maximum of $1,000 in contributions
to a particular candidate per fiscal year. The measure also limits
political action committees' donations to $2,500 or $5,000 per
candidate per fiscal year, depending on the size of the committee.
   The limits are based on fiscal years that start on July 1. Since
state campaigns typically span two calendar years, the measure
creates three contribution periods. An individual can give a
candidate $3,000 over two calendar years.
   The judge said that helps incumbents because they usually start
fund-raising earlier than challengers do.
   Two of Proposition 73's three authors, Assembly Republican
Leader Ross Johnson and Independent state Sen. Quentin Kopp, said
they would ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn
Karlton's ruling.
   ``The timing of this decision is most unfortunate,'' Johnson
said.
   Former Gov. Jerry Brown, chairman of the state Democratic Party,
one of the plaintiffs in the case, said the decision ``strikes down
one of the most pernicious campaign laws ever enacted and puts an
end to the pervasive state censorship of grassroots activism
imposed by Proposition 73.''
   Wilson had nearly $4 million at the start of the general
election campaign in July. Feinstein had $645,000. Spokesmen for
both candidates said they didn't know how much had been raised
since July.

<HEAD>Saudi Ambassador Criticizes King Hussein For Supporting Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United
States, in a bluntly worded open letter to King Hussein of Jordan,
takes his fellow Arab to task for siding with Iraq in the current
Mideast standoff.
   The ambassador, Bandar bin Sultan Al-Saud, also chided Hussein
for failing to protect Moslem holy places and doing little to
advance the cause of Palestinian statehood.
   The ambassador's letter was published on the op-ed pages of The
Washington Post and The New York Times in Wednesday editions.
   Relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan have soured because of
Hussein's attempts to keep good relations with Iraq and his
criticisms of the deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia
following Iraq's takeover of Kuwait last month
   Last Saturday Saudi Arabia expelled 20 Jordanian diplomats,
reportedly fo gathering information on strategic Saudi
installations for Iraq.
   Referring to a televised speech of the King to the American
public last week, Prince Bandar asked: ``Wouldn't it be more
honorable and truly moving if you had been moved enough by Kuwaiti
women and children with tears in their eyes because they lost their
country as a result of the aggression of your friend Saddam
Hussein?''
   He asked the Jordanian king, who has criticized the presence of
non-Moslem troops in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest shrines,
``what you have done to safeguard the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre that you lost to the Israelis in 1967?''
   The prince noted that Hussein has defended the Palestinian
people's right to self-determination, but said that Jordan did not
give statehood to Palestinians in the West Bank, now under Israeli
occupation, when Jordan controlled the area from 1948 to 1967.
``And how would the occupation of Kuwait give our brother
Palestinians their homeland?''
   Bandar also attacked Iraq's argument, repeated by Jordan, that
the Kuwait-Iraqi border is disputed because it was drawn up by
colonial Britain: ``Your Majesty, you should be the last one to say
that. Not only all your borders, but your whole country was created
by the same colonial British.''
   The ambassador contradicted Hussein's statements that the
situation resembled Europe of 1914, drifting into a world war:
``Your Majesty, the situation today is like the 1930s, when a
madman decided to annex his neighbor and the world did nothing,
which led to World War II,'' a reference to Hitler's takeovers of
Czechoslovakia and Austria.
   The Saudi leader closed the letter on a strikingly personal
tone:
   ``Your Majesty, I long had great respect and affection for you
to have deep respect and affection for your people. But I no longer
can feel that you are the same man I knew. I hope that I am wrong.
And if I am wrong, please accept my sincere apologies, Your
Majesty. But facts are stubborn things.''

<HEAD>Governor to Auction His Radar Detector</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After being pulled over by legislators,
Gov. George Sinner has donated his radar detector to a charity
auction today.
   ``It grieves me greatly to part with this priceless family
heirloom, but I'm willing to make this sacrifice in the interest of
promoting mental tranquility for Bryce Streibel and Pete Naaden,''
he said.
   The two Republican state senators, frequent critics of the
Democratic governor, noticed the detector on the dashboard of
Sinner's truck when they visited the Capitol two weeks ago.
   Sinner appoints the chief of the Highway Patrol, and during the
Labor Day weekend had called on truckers to alert police to
speeders.
   The governor at first shrugged off the matter, calling the
detector ``sort of a sacred, emotional thing'' that had sentimental
value as a gift from his children. But on Tuesday, he had a change
of heart.
   The North Dakota Mental Health Association was to sell the radar
detector at its annual auction.
   ``When is the governor's residence going on the block?''
Streibel asked. ``I think that's next.''

<HEAD>AMA Complains to Bush About Medicare Investigator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association wants the
federal health department's inspector general fired, claiming the
former FBI agent has been reckless and unfair in pursuing Medicare
and Medicaid fraud.
   The AMA, in a letter to President Bush, argued that Richard
Kusserow has discredited the administration in carrying out his
oversight duties at the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Kusserow was out of town Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. His spokeswoman, Judy Holtz, said the office was surprised
by the AMA's action. She said she could not comment, except to say:
``The inspector general's record speaks for itself.''
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on health, quickly came to Kusserow's
defense, putting out a statement shortly after the AMA released its
letter to reporters.
   ``Criticism from the AMA is a red badge of courage to Mr.
Kusserow,'' said Stark, who often is criticized by the organization
himself. ``Anyone who resists giving the AMA completely free access
to the Treasury and the taxpayer's wallet is immediately branded by
the AMA as anti-doctor. Dick Kusserow should get a medal for saving
the taxpayer fortunes. That he is being criticized today is a sure
sign he is doing his job.''
   Dr. Robert McAfee, vice chairman of the AMA Board of Trustees,
said frustration over Kusserow's actions has built up over the last
five years to the point that ``physicians don't trust him any
more.''

<HEAD>Task Force Studies Immigration Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harsher penalties should be levied against
employers who discriminate against foreign-looking workers to avoid
hiring illegal aliens, according to an administration task force.
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act ``was not intended
to be a barrier for persons who are eligible to work, but the
evidence shows that many employers are discriminating by adopting
exclusionary hiring practices,'' the task force said Tuesday in its
report to Congress.
   Those practices include hiring only applicants who prove they
were born on U.S. soil and rejecting legal immigrants who present
work-authorization documents issued by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the study said.
   The task force said fines for discriminating against
foreign-looking workers should be commensurate with the penalties
for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. That would
increase the maximum fine for repeated discrimination from $2,000
to $10,000, it said.
   The task force also recommended streamlining the procedures for
employers to check documents that applicants present to prove
citizenship or legal status.

<HEAD>Stocks Plummet In Tokyo, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell more than
1,000 points Wednesday to end at a 32-month low. The dollar closed
higher against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 1,108 points, or 4.75
percent, ending the day at 22,250.62, the lowest closing level
since Jan. 5, 1988. On that day, the Nikkei closed at 21,575.28.
   The index, which shed 418.51 points on Tuesday, rose about 150
points in early trading before falling back.
   The dollar closed at 137.40 yen, up 0.70 yen from Tuesday's
close. It opened at 136.57 yen and ranged between 136.45 yen and
137.40.
   Share prices rose early Wednesday morning because stability in
bond markets and the New York Stock Exchange's strength reassured
Japanese investors, traders said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 32.67 points to close at
2,485.64.
   However, the index slowed down its gains and reversed direction
as investors' buying interest did not last, said Haruhito Ichimura,
a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co.
   ``The decline was not because of massive, panic-selling . . .
but the decline below the 23,000-point level must be quite a shock
to the market,'' he said. ``Because many investors believed that
the 23,000-point level would be the bottom.''
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened from the opening
as a result of the yen's weakness against the European currencies
in cross-trading, dealers said.
   They said continuing uncertainties in the Persian Gulf crisis
are supporting the dollar despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
   Some market players see the United Nations' decision to impose
an air embargo on Iraq as the last peaceful move the U.S.-led
allies can take against Saddam Hussein.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey led the nation last year in spending
an average of $8,439 per pupil, while Utah ranked last at less than
one-third that amount.
   New Jersey, now locked in a bitter struggle over school
finances, thus replaced New York as the nation's per-pupil spending
leader, according to the National Education Association ranking.
New York placed second at $8,094.
   Utah spent $2,733 per pupil, according to the annual report.
   ``It's not a pleasant place to be,'' Scott Bean, Utah deputy
schools superintendent, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. He
pointed out, however, that the Legislature enacted some $130
million in education spending increases last year.
   Nationwide, spending per pupil averaged $4,890 in 1989-90, up
from $4,607 the year earlier.
   Average teacher salaries reached $31,166, compared with $29,570
the previous year, according to the teacher union's figures.
   Alaska, with its high cost of living, paid teachers the most on
average: $43,153. South Dakota teachers ranked last: $21,300.
   Connecticut's teachers got the biggest pay boost last year and
now rank second. Average pay was $40,461 in 1989-90, up more than
$3,000 from $37,343.
   Spending per pupil actually declined in two states: North
Dakota, where it fell to $3,581 in 1989-90 from $3,662 the year
before, and in Montana, where it dropped to $4,147 from $4,176.
   In North Dakota a voter referendum in December repealed three
tax increases.
   Officials differ on whether more money necessarily means better
schooling.
   ``A lot of people say, `Throwing more dollars won't help
education.' Well, I'd like to try it just once,'' said Utah's Bean.
   Will Myers, a school finance consultant who helped compile the
NEA statistics, said per-pupil spending bears a strong relationship
to class size.
   Utah had the highest pupil-to-teacher ratio in 1989-90: 23.6.
New Jersey's was 13.4, third-lowest among the states for which such
statistics were available.
   Other factors accounting for state-to-state spending disparities
include how homogeneous the student population is and the cost of
living in a given state.
   ``Most of the research that deals with spending versus school
performance indicates that family background is pretty important,''
Myers said Tuesday. ``When you have a heterogenous population, you
probably have a more difficult job bringing students to the same
educational level than when you have a homogeneous population.''
   ``Utah and New Jersey are in sharp contrast in that respect,''
he said.
   The NEA survey is based on statistics from state departments of
education. The data are regarded as among the most reliable of
their kind by education researchers.
   Other top spenders among the 50 states included: New York,
$8,094 per pupil; Connecticut, $7,934; the District of Columbia,
$7,407; Alaska, $7,252; Rhode Island, $6,523; Massachusetts,
$6,170; Maryland, $5,887; Delaware, $5,848, and Wisconsin, $5,703.

   The latest Lassie showed up Tuesday in a white stretch limousine
for a ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The occasion, to

   The Eric Knight novel produced numerous movies about the brave

series ran from 1954 to 1971.
   Lassie earned her place in the Hollywood concrete in 1960.
   The cast and crew of the current syndicated Lassie series
starring a 7-year-old collie attended Tuesday's ceremony.
   Lassie's trainer, Rob Weatherwax, accepted a 3-foot replica of
the star from Johnny Grant, honorary mayor of Hollywood. Weatherwax
is the son of the original Lassie trainer, Rudd Weatherwax.
   In all, six male descendants of the original Lassie - a male

<HEAD>Houston Jail Inmates Freed, Some Residents Fearful</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of guns and burglary alarms have picked up
in the nation's fourth-largest city since the courts ordered the
release of more than 270 inmates to relieve overcrowding at the
Harris County Jail.
   All the freed inmates had been jailed on misdemeanors. But for
some Houston-area residents, that's no more reassuring than hearing
Houston trails Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and Detroit in
crime.
   At least 31 of the 276 inmates freed on personal recognizance
bond since Sept. 14 are already back behind bars, police said.
Seven have been charged with felonies, including armed robbery in
one case, police said.
   ``We're just arresting the same people. We're letting them out
and arresting them again,'' said Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen. ``The
citizens of Harris County have again been victimized by the
system.''
   The jail, designed for 4,200 inmates, now has about 6,300, down
from a peak of 8,800 a year ago.
   The early releases were set in motion when the county missed an
Aug. 31 deadline set by U.S. District Judge James DeAnda to reduce
the population to 6,100.
   Bill Carter, president of Carter's Country gun shops, reported a
10 percent increase in gun sales.
   ``There's a lot of talk in the community about the jail releases
and we've had a lot of women come in for shooting lessons,'' he
said.
   Harris County blames the state for the overcrowding. Inmates in
county jails are supposed to be sent to state prisons once they are
convicted of state crimes. But the prisons are overcrowded and slow
to take jail inmates.
   The jail's overcrowding has been kicking around the courts for
18 years, with Assistant Attorney General Robert Ozer guiding the
state's case since 1987. Ozer accused county officials of
sensationalizing the releases.
   ``What it creates for the public is a kind of panic,'' he said.
``It appears the system is breaking down, when in reality, some of
these people shouldn't have been placed in these facilities to
begin with.''
   Similar lawsuits over inmate overcrowding also have resulted in
the early release of prisoners in other states.
   James Oitzinger, who represented Harris County inmates in a
lawsuit that resulted in the early releases, said some of those set
free would have been out on the street anyway in a matter of days.
   ``To me, it's a great big yawn,'' he said.
   When the first batch of nearly 80 inmates poured out of the jail
Sept. 14, they were confronted by a group called Mothers of
Murdered Children waving signs and shouting protests.
   ``There's a lot of people scared,'' said Freda Baker, co-owner
of Baker's Indoor Pistol Range.
   ``They're worried about their safety. ... They're arming
themselves to protect themselves,'' said her husband, C.T. Baker,
who reported a jump in the number of people calling for
instructions on how to handle firearms.
   David Wilt, owner of Detection Alarms, said customers who asked
for estimates three months ago are now calling back to buy home
security systems.
   The state is aggressively building more prisons, but they won't
be open soon.
   ``I think we all realize Texas has a serious problem - I don't
think that's any news to anybody,'' said Harris County Judge Jon
Lindsay. ``It's probably a little more acute here in Harris
County.''

<HEAD>Child Cases Likely To Number 10 Million By 2000, WHO Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the year 2000 at least 10 million children will
likely be infected with the AIDS virus, while another 10 million
will be orphaned by the immune-stripping disease, the World Health
Organization says.
   Most victims will be in the Third World, where AIDS will become
a major child killer, Dr. Michael Merson, a WHO official, said
Tuesday.
   That would reverse progress made in improving health through
vaccinations and other child care programs.
   WHO forecast that HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that
causes AIDS, will spread to 25 to 30 million people by the year
2000. Previous projections of 15 to 20 million did not take
children into account, a WHO statement said.
   The U.N. agency estimates that 8 to 10 million people, including
3 million women of childbearing age, may already be infected with
the virus.
   Merson told a news conference that WHO only recently started
compiling statistics on childhood cases because of the upsurge in
infection among women, and hence their offspring, was still
relatively new.
   AIDS destroys the body's immune system. The HIV virus is spread
through sexual contact, shared syringes and contaminated blood. It
often is transmitted from a mother to her unborn child, although
occasionally can be spread through the mother's milk during
breastfeeding.
   Merson, head of WHO's anti-AIDS unit, said 30 percent of infants
born to infected mothers were HIV-positive, and four-fifths of
those young sufferers died before age 5.
   Of the remaining 70 percent, many were likely to become orphans,
placing a huge strain on the scarce resources of poor countries, he
said.
   He added that scientists did not know why so many children
escaped infection from their mothers.
   The WHO statement said that an estimated 400,000 children have
developed severe AIDS symptoms since the epidemic began a decade
ago. Nearly 90 percent of the cases were in sub-Saharan Africa.
   The statement said that during the next 10 years, the disease is
expected to push up infant mortality rates by 50 percent in parts
of Africa.
   In addition to the young victims, 800,000 adults are also

<HEAD>Excerpts From Saddam Hussein Videotape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts from Saddam
Hussein's 75-minute speech to the American people. The English
translation comes from subtitles and voice-overs supplied by Iraqi
authorities.
   
   On President Bush's policies toward the Iraqi people:
   
   Bush has said to the people of Iraq that the American
administration had no quarrel with them. To prove that, he said
that the administration had allowed the Iraqis to purchase some of
the goods they needed, particularly grains, on the U.S. market. He
also said that the U.S. administration had also helped to bring
about the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war.
   The U.S. president was not accurate in saying that the U.S.
administration had no quarrel with the people of Iraq. We have
evidence that President Bush was himself involved in the Iran-gate
or Iran-Contra conspiracy against Iraq in 1986 when he was Reagan's
vice president.
   Voices had already begun to be raised in the U.S. and Britain
for an economic, technological and scientific boycott to be imposed
on Iraq well before the emergence of the current Gulf crisis. Some
of the boycott measures against Iraq including the embargo on the
export of grains and other commodities to Iraq had already been
discussed and adopted by the U.S. and some Western countries before
August 2, 1990, the day on which the Iraqi army extended assistance
in throwing out the former rulers of Kuwait who had been installed
by the former rulers of Kuwait who had been installed by foreign
powers to impose a despotic rule on this severed part of Iraq.
   
   On the trade embargo against Iraq, and the United Nations'
failure to impose embargoes on Israel or Syria after it moved
troops into Lebanon:
   
   Such measures were never taken against Israel when it announced
its annexation of Arab lands and cities in an official and final
manner.
   No U.S. armies have ever been deployed against that regime, nor
have we seen an embargo or boycott being imposed against the Syrian
regime. ... Yet we see how the armies of the U.S. have been
deployed against Iraq and how the valiant Iraqi people have been
denied food, medicine and even their children's milk.
   This has been imposed through a decision taken exclusively by
the U.S., contrary to Bush's claim that those measures were taken
by international organizations. These international organizations
came indeed later only to be used as a cover for measures already
drawn up.
   
   On U.S. and British leadership in opposing Iraq:
   
   These measures taken by the U.S. and Britain, including their
military buildup in the region, along with the imposition of the
economic embargo and boycott, came well in advance of any official
international measure. It was the U.S. and Britain who go to the
international organizations to take those measures. Indeed, they
even forced some countries into participating in those measures
against their will. Pressure was exerted on Japan, Germany, Italy
and other countries. Pressure in its open form could be seen every
day by the U.S. citizen on television or heard or read about in the
other mass media.
   
   On Iraq's annexation of Kuwait:
   
   The return of Kuwait to the fold of Iraq, its motherland from
which it was long severed, and usurped, like an infant separated
from its mother, will further strengthen the Arab nation and Iraq
in their endeavor to reassert their role on the human and pan-Arab
levels.
   
   On Bush's refusal to open a dialogue with Saddam:
   
   How can Bush know Saddam Hussein or the colleagues of Saddam
Hussein in the leadership when he refuses to have a direct dialogue
with Saddam Hussein or enter into a direct debate on TV?
   
   On how war with Iraq would be a disaster:
   
   Bush wants to bring back the sorrows of America and humanity by
repeating the Vietnam experience, only this time in a more radical
manner and more violent and more casualties.
   Bush, ladies and gentlemen, is sending your sons to war for no
purpose save fatal arrogance.
   
   On a solution to the gulf crisis:
   
   The solution is in what we have called. Let us discuss all the
issues of the Middle East (at) once - Palestine, Lebanon and the
Gulf in the Security Council and with one aim is to come up with
universal standards, taking into consideration the specificity of
each case.
   
   On the food embargo and Iraqi children:
   
   You should remember that thousands of children in Iraq will die
because of malnutrition as a consequence of lack of milk and many
of them - and many people will lack - will - their health will
deteriorate because of lack of adequate food and medicine and the
milk of children.
   
   On the taking of Western hostages:
   
   Those who are speaking about foreigners prohibited from
traveling from Iraq, they should remember that the people of Iraq
are prohibited from leaving, and they are hostages because they
have no way of traveling.
   
   On the air blockade and Iraq-Kuwait unity:
   
   Some of you are speaking about blockading air travel. Have you
ever heard - have you heard of such measures? When Bush is told,
why are you against union - unity between Iraq and Kuwait, and you
did not object to the unity between East and West Germany?
   
   On world opinion against Iraq:
   
   What we worry about is the judgment of God on the final day and
the judgment of history and our people. And we respect world public
opinion when this world public opinion is based on objective facts.
Otherwise, world public opinion is nothing but the result of Satan.

<TEXT>
   A high school dropout's dream of putting to use
his new college diploma was shattered by a random gang attack. A
girl's ninth birthday ended with a stray bullet as she lay on her
mother's bed.
   From New York to Chicago to Milwaukee, big cities are seeking
emergency gun control measures as they battle a dramatic rise in
violent crimes, many involving random killings of innocent victims.
   ``It doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing, the
lives of people in the inner city ... are at stake,'' said
anti-crime activist Ruth Varnado, whose Reclaiming the Streets
movement has won praise from President Bush.
   Milwaukee, a city of 600,000, has seen its murder rate jump by
more than half to 18.7 per 100,000 residents between 1988 and 1989.
That translated into a record 116 homicides in 1989. Already this
year, 115 killings have been recorded. A decade ago, there were
fewer than 100 homicides in all of Wisconsin.
   Of even greater concern is the randomness of three killings in
Milwaukee this month.
   Nine-year-old Shereker Wilkins, whose family recently fled a
Chicago housing project, was lying on her mother's bed Saturday
night after celebrating her birthday when a stray bullet pierced
the bedroom wall and struck her in the head. She died 10 hours
later. Her mother couldn't afford the funeral.
   ``I wanted to get away from the drug dealers, gangs, shootings,
the projects and make a new start for my kids,'' said Ruby Wilkins.
``I thought I had moved somewhere where I would be safe.''
   A week earlier, a 17-year-old was accused of randomly selecting
and executing Charles Davis, 19, to prove in a street gang
initiation rite that he knew how to kill. Davis, a high school
dropout, had recently earned a degree from Milwaukee Area Technical
College and got a job at a lawn mower factory.
   In the same neighborhood, Tammy Reilly, 17, was killed Saturday
by an errant blast from a sawed-off shotgun as she listened to
music in a relative's apartment.
   ``It's going to take a long time for this community to ever
heal. They're are just too many scars,'' said Queen Hyler, founder
of Stop the Violence, a citizen group. ``I'm not going to sit here
and watch them bury another 9-year-old without shaking this city
up.''
   Ms. Hyler isn't alone in her efforts. City and county officials
this week began drawing up emergency measures to enforce gun
registration.
   In Chicago, 628 slayings have been recorded so far this year,
111 more than all of last year. The City Council this week began
emergency hearings to seek new ways to control drugs and gangs.
   In New York City, 16 children have been shot since July 22 and
six have died, police said. Mayor David Dinkins has also issued
calls for tighter gun controls.
   In Milwaukee, Police Chief Philip Arreola refused interviews
this week and instructed his officers not to discuss the spate of
killings.
   Community activists blame the rising crime rate on double-digit
unemployment and inadequate funding for schools, drug
rehabilitation and counseling for gang members.
   ``We said in 1989 if you don't help us on the front side, then
you'll have to pay for it on the back side,'' Ms. Varnado said.
``The back side is that our babies are dying.''
   Said Ms. Hyler, ``You have to live around the bullets, you have
to see the mother's crying, you have to be afraid to come out of
your door, you have to see murders. When you're living like that
you know what the problem is.''

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. drug agent patrolling a major
cocaine-producing region with Bolivian anti-narcotics police and
other American agents was wounded by drug traffickers in an ambush,
the U.S. ambassador reported.
   Police returned the fire and killed at least one of the machine
gun-wielding traffickers, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said
Tuesday. The agent was shot in the arm and leg but not seriously
hurt.
   The ambush Monday was the most serious confrontation between
traffickers and Bolivian police and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents in recent years. Poor communications from the
remote region prevented the news from reaching official circles
until Tuesday.
   ``The traffickers reacted in a violent way because they are
beginning to feel the affects of the U.S. and Bolivian anti-drug
operations,'' Gelbard said.
   Police and agents were on a routine patrol in the Chapare
coca-producing region when at least 20 heavily armed traffickers
fired on them, the ambassador told The Associated Press. The
Chapare is in the center of Bolivia, about 250 miles east of La
Paz.
   Traffickers also fired on U.S.-donated helicopters that were
sent in to rescue the wounded agent.
   At least two Bolivian policemen were missing.
   Bolivian police units have been mobilized in the area in the
effort to capture the traffickers.
   Bolivia is the second-largest cocaine producer in the world
after Colombia.
   The Chapare, an area the size of New Jersey, produces an
estimated one-third of the coca leaves that eventually are made
into cocaine paste and further processed into pure cocaine.
   The DEA has been operating in Bolivia since the early 1970s but
its efforts have increased markedly in the region the last five
years. There are an estimated 60 U.S. DEA, border patrol agents and
military advisers in Bolivia.
   The ambush took place near the village of Isinuta, a major
coca-leaf production and cocaine paste distribution center in the
Chapare.

   At least once a week, from his
vantage point atop Clinch Mountain, Francis Collins files an
intelligence report of sorts.
   He calls state officials to tell them just how red, yellow and
gold the forests below his restaurant are becoming.
   Collins is one of a small band of ``color observers'' who will
alert the rest of North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee when fall
color is at its peak.
   Spectacular foliage may be most closely associated with New
England - an estimated 3 million ``leaf peepers'' from across the
country visit that region each fall - but it also brings thousands
to the southern Appalachians.
   The three Southern states have formed a loose network of color
watchers to help tourists plan their trips.
   Many of the observers are forestry or recreation officials.
Some, like Collins, are volunteers - regular folk with time on
their hands and an eye for color: the reddish-orange of the sugar
maple, the solid, fiery red of the sweet gum tree, the yellows of
the elm, hackberry and tulip poplar, and the splash of green of the
fir.
   Some watch from their front porches, others from their cars and
trucks as they drive through the forests on these warm September
days and cool evenings.
   ``As long as I've lived around these hills, you can pretty well
guess at it,'' Collins said. ``We're setting right up on top and we
can pretty much see the world.''
   And the way things are shaping up, now the peak will be the
third week of October, Collins said. He guessed now that maybe 15
percent of the leaves have changed on the mountaintop. In lower
elevations, a few leaves are turning now.
   Admittedly, ``there's not a real scientific sample,'' said Bob
Miller, spokesman for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Park
officials look at the trees each week from late September to early
November to estimate a percentage.
   Collins has read up on his trees and keeps a close eye on the
subtle changes. In a pinch, he can seek some advice from some of
the old-timers who come by.
   Most people helping the state simply know trees.
   ``The only way I've got to go is the degree of color,'' said
James Smith of Rockwood, a grocery-store owner and color observer
last year. ``I was raised in the country so I know most of the
trees.''
   Smith and Collins agreed 1990 has the makings of a good year for
color. The summer was hot, there was rain late in the season and
fall has arrived with warm days and cool nights.
   ``It looks like we're going to have a good change,'' Collins
said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rejects Keating's Bid for Cut in $5 Million Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Charles H. Keating's request to
lower his $5 million bail has been denied by a California appeals
court.
   The court, without comment, turned down the request Tuesday from
the Arizona developer blamed by regulators for the nation's biggest
thrift collapse, the $2 billion failure of his Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan.
   Keating was indicted last week on charges of swindling investors
in now-worthless junk bonds sold through the Irvine-based S&amp;L.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner acknowledged that $5 million is a
high price for freedom, but he added, ``You can't consider Mr.
Keating without thinking of Robert Vesco'' - the financier who fled
the country while under investigation during the Nixon
administration.
   Keating contends he is broke and can't adequately defend himself
from jail. Defense attorney Stephen C. Neal said earlier he would
pursue every avenue to get Keating out. The next appeal would be to
the California Supreme Court.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner had set Keating's bail,
saying he might flee rather than risk 10 years in prison. Keating's
three co-defendants, executives in his empire, got out on bail of
$100,000 to $200,000 last week.
   All four are due in court Oct. 5 to enter a plea.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements says he will appeal a
ruling that the state's method of financing its schools remains
unconsitutional.
   State District Judge Scott McCown ruled Tuesday that the $14
billion overhaul adopted earlier this year in response to a Texas
Supreme Court decision still doesn't give schools ``substantially
equal'' access to funds.
   Instead, ``the rich districts are left rich, the poor districts
poor,'' he said.
   McCown gave legislators until Sept. 1, 1991, to again reform the
3.3-million-student system, which relies on state and federal aid
and local propery taxes.
   If a suitable plan is not devised by then, McCown said he may
stop the spending of tax money on schools or order how the money
can be spent.
   ``I don't agree with his judgment at all,'' the governor said.
``He's a young judge. Perhaps the Supreme Court in its review will
reconsider that opinion.''
   The judge ruled that financial inequities between schools are
caused by the wide range in property values across the state.
   ``What the rich districts spend creates educational
opportunities for their children that are denied the children of
poor districts,'' he said.
   Rick Gray, a lawyer for poor districts that challenged the new
system, was jubilant.
   ``We think it's a great day for all schoolchildren, and we hope
the Legislature will set about the task of fixing the system in the
future,'' he said.
   The overhaul was adopted in June after four special legislative
sessions. Among other things, it raised taxes to add $528 million
for schools during the 1990-91 year.
   Poor districts had argued that the new plan was no different
from the old setup, which was scrapped by the Texas Supreme Court
in a 9-0 ruling last year.
   Texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned
school finance systems in recent years. Others include Kentucky,
New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington,
West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   Clements leaves office in January. The gubernatorial nominees,
Democrat Ann Richards and Republican Clayton Williams, both oppose
new taxes.
   ``I think that the people are going to be very interested in
knowing exactly how they propose to solve the problem without any
new money,'' said Education Commissioner W.N. Kirby.

   New York City is reviving a program to
distribute condoms to students because of the continued rise in
AIDS and unwanted pregnancies.
   ``We see both these things as in crisis proportions in certain
communities,'' Carmen Rivera, director of Mayor David Dinkins'
office of health policy, said Tuesday.
   City Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez is preparing the
proposal with backing from the mayor.
   James Vlasto, a spokesman for Fernandez, said the details were
still being worked out. But Rivera said the condoms would be
distributed through health clinics in 20 junior high and high
schools, which serve tens of thousands of students.
   The school system briefly distributed condoms in 1986 but
stopped because of opposition from several Board of Education
members, including the current president, Gwendolyn Baker. The
Roman Catholic Archdiocese also opposed the program.
   Rivera said most of the seven board members, including Baker,
now support the plan. Five of the current board members were not
there in 1986.

<HEAD>China Applauds Its Own Diplomatic Rebound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China today applauded its diplomatic rebound from
last year's status as an object of world scorn to this year's as
respected participant in U.N. deliberations on the Persian Gulf.
   ``This year our nation's foreign relations have made gratifying
progress,'' declared a front-page People's Daily editorial. The
newspaper's editorials are written by the top Communist Party
leadership and amount to policy statements.
   China ``is winning more and more friends worldwide and a good
international prestige,'' the editorial said. It maintained that
this vindicated China's domestic policies, including its violent
crushing of a massive student-led movement for democracy in June
1989.
   That incident, in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were
killed, caused the industrialized democracies to freeze high-level
exchanges with China and curb soft loans. But the sanctions have
recently shown signs of crumbling, due to China's release of
hundreds of political prisoners and its cooperation in approving
U.N. Security Council resolutions punishing Iraq.
   The People's Daily said China's foreign policy gains were a
``vivid reflection of our country's independent, self-initiated and
peaceful foreign policy.''
   ``Since last year, international forces completely hostile to
China raised an anti-China tide and brazenly interfered in China's
internal affairs, established sanctions against our country and
plotted to isolate China.
   ``China did not knuckle under to foreign pressure and continued
to carry out the basic line set by our party of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.''
   It indirectly defended the army's June 1989 attack on unarmed
protesters, saying, ``Just think, if a nation of 1.1 billion people
has daily turmoil and can't manage its economy, how can it gain the
respect and trust of other peoples?''
   The editorial also pointed up China's renewed interest in its
discarded, 1960s role as a leader of the Third World. It said that
strengthening cooperation with Third World countries was the basic
point of China's foreign policy, and championed the Third World
call for a more equal distribution of wealth and power among
nations.
   China's biggest foreign relations gains over the past year have
been with non-Western countries. Beijing opened or restored
relations with Namibia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, and is expected
to establish ties with Singapore before year's end.
   China also recently has made repeated overtures to Japan and the
West. It sent Education Minister Li Tieying to Japan and a group of
mayors to the United States, while giving warm, high-level
receptions toanese and Western businessmen visiting Beijing.
   Since China cooperated on approving U.N. sanctions on trade with
Iraq, there have been indications that its freeze-out by Japan and
the West is nearing an end.
   The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations at a meeting
this week in Washington expressed openness to restoring loans to
China.
   Last week Japan sent its first Ccbinet-level minister to Beijing
since June 1989 when Education Minister Kosuke Hori arrived for the
opening of the Asian Games. Japan also has indicated willingness to
restore development aid to China.
   A bill was submitted Tuesday to the U.S. House of
Representatives proposing that China's preferential trade status be
canceled. But Congress is not expected to pass the measure, and the
White House has indicated it would veto it.

   Share prices nose-dived in Tokyo today, closing at
their lowest level since early 1988 due to panic-selling and
worries about the Persian Gulf crisis, traders said. The dollar was
up against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average dropped 1,108.70 points, or
4.75 percent, ending the day at 22,250.62, its lowest closing level
since Jan. 5, 1988. On that day, the Nikkei closed at 21,575.28.
   ``As soon as the Nikkei fell below the 23,000-point line,
individual investors started panic selling,'' said Kozo Hasunuma, a
dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Until Wednesday, the 23,000-point line had been seen as the
market's bottom. ``But now there will be no psychological
resistance until the 21,000-point level, which is expected to be
the next turning point according to the market's past patterns,''
Hasunuma said.
   He said the market's recovery will be ``very difficult now
because there is no positive element to encourage buying by
investors.''
   The Nikkei index now has lost 8,587.37 points, or about 28
percent, since Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Since
the beginning of this year, the Nikkei has lost 16,665.25 points,
or nearly 43 percent.
   Analysts say investors are afraid the Japanese economy will be
badly hurt if the nation's oil supply is cut off by a deterioration
of the gulf crisis. Japan depends on imports for 99 percent of its
oil needs, and 70 percent of comes from the Middle East.
   Total trading today was moderate, with many institutional
investors staying on the sidelines as individuals hurriedly tried
to dispose of their shares, traders said. An estimated 350 million
shares changed hands on market's first section, up from 230 million
the previous day.
   Hasunuma said many individuals were forced to sell their stocks
in order to come up with payments for issues they had bought on
margin.
   The Nikkei index, which shed 418.51 points on Tuesday, rose
about 150 points in early trading today before falling back.
   On the foreign exchange market, investors sold the yen in
reaction to the decline in share prices, traders said. The yen's
fall accelerated toward the end of the day, said Minori Takeuchi, a
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar closed at 137.40 yen, up 0.70 yen from Tuesday's
136.70-point finish. The currency began the day at 136.57 yen and
ranged between 136.45 yen and 137.40 yen, as $11.34 billion changed
hands in spot trading. Tuesday's volume was $8.15 billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 80.73 points, down from 80.77
Tuesday and a record closing low. Their yield rose to 8.690 percent
from 8.680 percent Tuesday.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Test Results Fail to Link Suspects to Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police boosted patrols in the area
where five students were slain after crime laboratory results
failed to link any suspects to the killings, a newspaper reported
today.
   It wasn't certain, however, whether the test results last week
cleared Edward Lewis Humphrey or any other suspects in the stabbing
deaths, or if they just failed to support existing suspicions, The
Gainesville Sun reported.
   Nor was it clear whether all tests had been completed, the
newspaper said.
   Police last week announced stepped-up night patrols where the
bodies of the five students were found last month. Four victims
attended the University of Florida; the fifth was a student at the
city's Santa Fe Community College.
   The beefed-up patrols were ordered after the task force received
the results of tests and after the apparent failure of intense
searches of woods frequented by Humphrey, an 18-year-old freshman
at the university, the newspaper said, citing law enforcement
sources it did not identify.
   Among the items that had been taken by investigators for testing
were pubic hair and blood samples from Humphrey and another
suspect, Stephen Michael Bates, 30. They are jailed on unrelated
charges; neither has been charged in the slayings.
   Other items collected for testing included semen, blood and a
single pubic hair found at one or more of the murder scenes and on
a knife found in a milk jug at Humphrey's home in Indialantic,
authorities said.
   Humphrey's lawyer, J.R. Russo, told the Sun he had no knowledge
of any test results.
   Task force members would not comment on lab tests, the newspaper
said.
   A police spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call
late Tuesday from The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Police Blame Vendetta by 14-Year-Old Girl for Picnic Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old girl took revenge on two
playmates by inviting them to a picnic and serving them a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich and grape drink laced with poison, police
say. Neither youngster was seriously hurt.
   The girl told friends she got the idea of putting rat poison in
the sandwich from the movie ``Heathers,'' an R-rated black comedy
featuring teen-age murder and a tight clique of popular girls, King
County police said.
   Other girls invited to the picnic and croquet party were aware
that a sandwich had been laced with rat poison and some grape drink
had been mixed with a household cleanser, police spokesman Tony
Burtt said Tuesday.
   The incident involved girls from at least three families Sept.
16 and was being investigated as a possible criminal assault,
police said.
   Detectives were awaiting results of food tests before deciding
whether to seek criminal charges in juvenile court, Burtt said.
   An 11-year-old girl had a stomach ache after taking several
bites of the sandwich and a 9-year-old vomited after sipping the
drink, police said.
   None of the children was identified.
   The dispute erupted partly because one girl apparently hid a
videotape of ``Heathers'' and then claimed another girl had it, the
mother of the girl who got the grape drink told the Valley Daily
News.
   ``It's scary because the girl that's supposed to have done all
this was a friend of my daughter's,'' the mother said. ``They've
been good friends for a year and they used to spend the night at
each other's houses.''
   The mother of the 14-year-old denied her daughter planned the
poisoning. In an interview in today's Daily News, she blamed two
other 11-year-old playmates at the picnic.
   ``At the very least, they were more than just witnesses,'' said
the mother, whose name the paper withheld to avoid identifying the
children.
   Police were told the dispute also involved some clothing and
jewelry one girl was accused of taking.
   Two girls told police they were at the 14-year-old's home the
day she came up with the plan, officers said.
   Police said the 14-year-old made peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches and put them in plastic bags. Rat poison was hidden in
one sandwich, which was cut and wrapped differently so it could be
picked from the others.
   Neighborhood children came to the picnic at a baseball field,
where the 14-year-old said she was going to ``pretend to make up''
with one girl, then giv her the tainted sandwich, police said. The
teen-ager said it would ``only make her throw up,'' other children
later told police.
   The girls were playing croquet. The movie ``Heathers'' contains
two scenes in which teen-age girls play croquet.

<HEAD>One-Third Fewer American Troops in Europe by 1995, U.S. Official
Says</HEAD>

   The United States expects to reduce its
300,000 troops in Europe by at least a third over the next five
years - but does not plan a total pullout, th American ambassador
to NATO said today.
   ``There are very important opportunities for reducing our forces
and for restructuring them'' in the changing Europe, William H.
Taft IV told journalists at the end of a brief visit to neutral
Sweden.
   ``We expect to see, within the next five years, a reduction of
at least a third (of U.S. troops in Europe), from 300,000 to
200,000,'' Taft said. ``If things go well, we could see further
reductions.''
   He also said that other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization are considering a U.S. request to send ground troops
to join American, British, French and Turkish soldiers facing Iraqi
forces in the Persian Gulf region.
   He did not name the countries considering the request. Other
NATO countries are West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Denmark,
Norway, Canada, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said soldiers and
airplanes from other nations would be welcome, even if the numbers
were only symbolic, in the effort to force Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Taft said all NATO countries have contributed military vessels
to the international armada enforcing an embargo on trade with
Iraq, except Iceland and Luxembourg, ``which don't have any.''
   He said West Germany sent ships to the Mediterranean.
   ``We're happy with the positive responses. ... We would like to
see the European allies do more,'' Taft said.
   ``We would not be happy if there's nothing more,'' he said.
``But we haven't given up.''
   International cooperation on the Persian Gulf crisis is
important because, Taft said, ``We're setting up the new (post-Cold
War) order of things, and the world needs to make it very clear
that invading a country and taking it over won't be accepted.''
   Taft said the ``haphazard'' reaction of European Community
members to the gulf crisis had shown that ``political cooperation
will have to be effected before it (the EC) can expand to military
affairs.''
   Taft said the United States supports the ``development of
European defense capability'' but foresaw no complete withdrawal of
U.S. military forces from Europe despite the fall of Communist
governments in Eastern Europe and improved relations with the
Soviets.
   He said no credible politician in the United States had proposed
a smaller American presence in Europe than 80,000.
   ``The United States is not considering, and no serious
politicians in the United States are suggesting, withdrawal of all
U.S. forces in Europe,'' Taft said. He added that no European
country, ``not even the Soviet Union, wants to see the United
States disengaged from Europe.
   ``It is the link the (NATO) alliance provides from the continent
with one superpower to another superpower. It's a balancing force,
a force of stability,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Bill Boner, whose affair with an
aspiring country singer has been good for a lot of snickering,
reportedly will marry her on Monday, four days after his divorce
from his third wife becomes final.
   Boner, 45, and Traci Peel, 34, will wed in Hawaii, The
Tennessean reported Tuesday, without citing its sources.
   A Boner spokesman said only that the mayor was on vacation and
would return next week.
   The wedding would cap a love affair chronicled by supermarket
tabloids and syndicated television after Peel told the Nashville
Banner the mayor's passion could last seven hours.
   Boner, a Democrat who left Congress in 1986 under the cloud of
an ethics investigation, announced in July that he and Peel were
engaged.
   At the time, Boner was estranged but still married and living
with his third wife, Betty, and their 4-year-old son. He had
already decided not to seek re-election.
   His divorce becomes final Thursday, The Tennessean reported.

   Residents have decided to call a halt on
traffic streaming through this crossroads community in eastern
Oregon.
   They've installed a traffic light - the first in the town's
107-year history.
   ``This is one of the best things that ever happened to the
town,'' Mayor Frank Alvarez said of the three-lens traffic signal
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday attended by about 70 of the
town's 1,615 residents.
   Though other towns in the region have resisted the need for a
red light, Stanfield is happy to have traffic come to a halt, even
if only for a moment.
   ``When you see old people standing on the curb for 45 minutes at
a time, trying to get across, you know it's kind of bad,'' City
Councilman Bob Swales said.
   Five years ago, the town earned headlines and a mention by
Johnny Carson on the ``Tonight Show'' when it passed an ordinance
outlawing public sex by animals.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in nervous and choppy
European trading late this morning. Gold prices were down, but off
their lows reached late in Asian trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was firming as banks
moved in and out of short-term positions.
   ``There's a lot of cross-trading going on, especially in the
yen, and this is moving the dollar against the European currencies
as well,'' said one trader in Milan.
   Cross-trading is trading between currencies other than the
dollar.
   The dollar gained in New York late Tuesday, boosted by a number
of factors including remarks by a West German finance official who
said he didn't see the risk of a free-fall in the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.70 yen to a closing 137.40 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted lower at 137.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   -1.5710 German marks, up from 1.5630
   -1.3060 Swiss francs, up from 1.2990
   -5.2555 French francs, up from 5.2340

   -1,175.65 Italian lire, up from 1,168.25
   -1.1560 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1493
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8680, cheaper for

  London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$401.75 per ounce at midmorning, down from $403.25 bid per ounce
late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $401.25, down from $404.25 late

   Tropical Storm Josephine retained its 40 mph top
winds early today, but could weaken and drop back to tropical
depression strength during the day, forecasters said.
   Josephine, which became the 10th tropical storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season Monday, was moving west at 9 mph this morning,
said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The system was expected to maintain that course and forward
speed for the next 24 hours, the agency said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Josephine was centered near 20.9 north latitude
and 38.1 west longitude, or about 860 miles west northwest of the
Cape Verde islands. The islands are off the coast of west Africa.
   Tropical depressions have maximum sustained winds of less than
39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes once their top winds
reach 74 mph.
   Josephine was born from the 12th depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   A legislator who worked undercover for
the FBI during a 16-month investigation into vote-buying in the
Statehouse has resigned.
   Rep. Robert Kohn, R-Charleston, was one of nine state lawmakers
indicted by a federal grand jury last month on charges of accepting
bribes in exchange for their support of a bill legalizing betting
on horses and greyhounds.
   They were indicted under the Hobbs Act, a federal law banning
acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or favors.
   Kohn, 45, who was first elected to the state Legislature in
1975, delivered his resignation Tuesday to House Speaker Bob
Sheheen, who had suspended him.
   The resignation was to take effect today, a few hours before he
was scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins
for a hearing. Kohn has pleaded innocent.
   On Aug. 16, when Kohn announced he would not seek re-election,
he said he had been working undercover for the FBI for several
months.
   ``While some people might question the wisdom of assisting (the
FBI) in their investigation, I can only say, `When the FBI wants
you to cooperate, you will cooperate,''' he said at the time.
   Tuesday, a judge issued a gag order and ordered court records
sealed in the case of state Rep. Luther Taylor, a Columbia
Democrat. Taylor's lawyers argued at a hearing Monday that pretrial
publicity had been prejudicial to his case.
   Taylor pleaded innocent and was scheduled to go to trial next
month.
   The FBI sting employed a former House member-turned-lobbyist,
Ron Cobb, who purported to represent an Atlanta organization that
supported efforts to legalize parimutuel betting on horses and
greyhounds in South Carolina.
   The indictment alleged Kohn and Taylor met with Cobb and agreed
to accept money for their support of the pari-mutuel bill. It also
alleged they agreed to recruit other lawmakers to support the bill.
   Kohn, if convicted, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison and a fine of $250,000.

<HEAD>Study Links Smoking With Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors may be able to predict a person's
tendency to smoke by knowing whether the individual has ever
suffered depression, a researcher says.
   A report in today's edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association says people who have suffered major depression
are twice as likely to smoke and half as likely to succeed at
quitting.
   ``People talk about some sort of addictive personality . . . but
don't know what makes people more addictive than others,'' said one
of the authors, Dr. Alexander H. Glassman, chief of clinical
pharmacology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at New
York's Columbia University.
   ``This seems to show that we can predict who is going to be more
addictable to a drug.''
   Though people sometimes say they smoke to relieve anxiety and
tension, the study failed to find a link between smokers and people
who had been diagnosed with phobias or panic disorders. It did find
that smoking was four times as common among alcoholics, Glassman
said.
   Researchers analyzed data collected from 3,213 people in the St.
Louis metropolitan area in the early 1980s as part of a national
psychiatric survey.
   They found that, among those who smoked, 6.6 percent had
suffered depression at one time in their lives and that, among
those who didn't smoke, 2.9 percent had suffered depression.
   The study didn't look into whether depression helps prompt
smoking, or vice versa. But Glassman said Tuesday he believes the
finding ``implies that people who get depressed are somehow more
vulnerable to nicotine ... to drugs.''
   A smoker was defined as someone who had smoked daily for at
least a month at some point in his life. Major depression was
defined as a sad or depressed mood persisting for at least two
weeks and including such symptoms as sleep disturbance and eating
disorders.
   The study was done by the New York State Psychiatric Institute,
Columbia University, the University of Vermont in Burlington and
Washington University in St. Louis.
   Previous studies have linked cigarette smoking and depressive
disorders among people who have sought psychiatric care. This study
is the first to analyze the rates from the community at large
regardless of whether the subjects had ever sought treatment for
depression, the study said.
   The study found that people with histories of depression had a
14 percent success rate in trying to quit, and those without such
problems had a 31 percent success rate.
   Commenting on the study, University of Chicago psychiatry
professor David Tobin said the finding was important in identifying
subgroups of smokers who may need a more aggressive treatment to
quit.
   Tobin said many smokers will buy a book or go to a group program
for a few sessions but won't seek a specialist's help for the
emotional upheaval associated with trying to quit.
   ``They are taking a very difficult problem and not devoting very
many resources in terms of time or money,'' he said. ``And if they
are depressed on top of it, they are going to try to give up
smoking with all that stacked against them.
   An unrelated study also published in today's journal said
smokers who try to quit with the aid of nicotine gum may render the
gum useless by drinking colas, coffee and other beverages.
   Researchers collected saliva from eight male smokers, having
half of them rinse their mouths with water and half with coffee and
cola after chewing.
   They found that rinsing with coffee or cola acidified the saliva
and virtually eliminated that amount of nicotine which the body
could absorb.
   The study was done by researchers at the National Institute on
Drug Abuse in Baltimore, the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center in
Lexington, Ky., and the University of Kentucky in Lexington.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Adopts New Law on Religious Freedoms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with later debate, details on provisions for
returning churches, human rights panel, ADDS background. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament today adopted a new freedom
of religion law, easing decades of strict prohibitions on religious
instruction at home and in private schools at a time of widespread
religious revival.
   The new law directs political leaders - who had in the past
actively discouraged religious services, confiscated churches,
repressed religious groups and preached atheism - not to interfere
with religious activities.
   It allows religious groups to set up ``societies, brotherhoods,
associations'' and other fraternal groups and specifies that the
government will finance neither religious activities nor
``propaganda of atheism.''
   But official tolerance for religion has increased dramatically
since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985. His mother is a
practicing Russian Orthodox and last year he acknowledged that he
had been baptized as a child.
   The law, adopted 341-1 with one abstention, says religious
organizations can send people abroad for spiritual study and
receive foreign students in the Soviet Union.
   It calls for the establishment of a panel of religious leaders
to advise the government on human rights issues and permits the
government to continue returning churches for use as religious
buildings.
   Many churches have fallen into disrepair or been used by the
government as storehouses, offices and even factories.
   The law guarantees the right to study and teach religion either
individually or with others.
   But a clause allowing secular facilities to be used for
religious instructions after regular school hours touched off a
fierce debate and was defeated by one chamber of the legislature.
   Lawmaker Genrikh Igityan of Armenia argued that ``every educated
person must study religion'' and that comparative world religions
should be on every curriculum.
   But Sergei Ryabchenko from the Ukraine said teaching
contradictory religious doctrines in schools could turn his
republic into ``another Beirut' because of friction between the
Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches.
   The clause was approved by the Council of the Union but defeated
by the Council of Nationalities and will have to be resolved by a
joint committee.
   The number of Christian baptisms and reopening of churches has
soared since Gorbachev came to power.
   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexi II, has
met with the Soviet leadership for the first time in more than 40
years and important religious centers like the Pechorsky Monastery
of Kiev have been returned to the church.
   On Sunday, a Divine Liturgy was held in the Kremlin's Uspensky
Cathedral, the first full service allowed in Russia's most
important cathedral since 1918.
   Jews are also enjoying greater religious freedom and a revival
of Islam in Central Asia is increasing the number of seminary
students and mosques.
   Scores of religious dissidents of all faiths have been freed
from jails and prison camps.
   Religious leaders, including Alexi II, and representatives of
the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Soviet Jewish community,
attended today's parliamentary debate.
   Alexi, addressing the lawmakers, requested permission to set up
a publishing house and use its income to repair broken down
churches. The legislature had no immediate response.
   Alexi, wearing a black clerical robe and white headpiece topped
with a gold cross, urged the government not to come between the
church and the people.
   ``The Russian church has already experienced attempts on a
political basis to destroy the unity of religious life,'' he said.
   Donations to religious organizations have been and remain
tax-free. The new law, however, cuts the tax rate from 69 percent
to 35 percent on the profits of enterprises affiliated with
religious groups.
   One ambiguous area of the new law concerns the military. The law
says military commanders cannot interfere with the participation of
soldiers in religious services during their free time.
   But Col. Vilyen Martirosyan, a lawmaker from the Ukraine, asked
the legislature whether military commanders now will be able to
organize services for religious soldiers.
   A member of the committee that drafted the law said that issue
would have to be worked out in the future.

   Flat Rock is only 10 miles north of Monroe,
but it's long distance by telephone. And until Michigan Bell
Telephone Co. fixed a computer mixup, the distance stretched all
the way to the Soviet Union.
   Michigan Bell on Monday switched the Monroe area, 35 miles south
of Detroit, to 11-digit long-distance dialing within the 313 area
code.
   But Monroe callers who didn't dial 313 when trying to reach Flat
Rock heard this recording: ``Direct service is available to Moscow
only. Calls to other areas of the Soviet Union must be placed
through your operator.''
   Then there were the Monroe area callers who didn't include 313
when dialing Milan and were told: ``Your international call cannot
be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again.''
   That's Milan, Mich., 15 miles northwest of Monroe, not Milan,
Italy.
   Michigan Bell said the recordings were triggered by computer
switching problems that were repaired later Monday.
   Now, callers who don't dial 313 are told what the phone company
meant for them to hear: ``We're sorry, it is necessary to dial an
area code when making this call. Please hang up and try your call
again.''
   And don't forget: Dial the operator for those calls to
Vladivostok.

<HEAD>Rival Christians Battle in Breach of Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with
mortars, tanks and rocket-propelled grenades today in one of the
most serious breaches of their cease-fire in four months.
   Police said a woman was killed and another wounded in the
flare-up, which occurred at daybreak between rebel Gen. Michel
Aoun's troops and Christian warlord Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militia.
   Thunderous shell blasts jolted thousands of residents from bed
in Beirut's Christian sector. They scurried into basements and
underground bomb bunkers in the embattled districts of Sin El-Fil
and Nabaa, police said.
   The fighting tapered into sporadic sniping at midmorning. Police
said traffic between the Moslem and Christian sectors of the
capital was not affected by the hostilities.
   Each side blamed the other for the violation of the May 17
cease-fire, which halted 15 weeks of savage fighting between Aoun's
15,000 troops and Geagea's 6,000 militiamen for mastery of the
Christian enclave north and northeast of Beirut.
   By police count, at least 1,045 people were killed and 2,798
wounded in the power struggle.
   The fighting caused an estimated $1 billion worth of damage and
forced about one-third of the enclave's 1 million population to
flee to safer areas.
   Aoun lost his sea outlets in the fighting, and Geagea's men now
control 80 percent of the Christian enclave. The area covers 310
square miles of coastal and mountainous territory.
   Today's battle came amid reports that President Elias Hrawi's
government, based in Moslem west Beirut, plans to tighten an
economic blockade of the zone controlled by Aoun.
   Several Beirut newspapers said Hrawi's troops, under Gen. Emile
Lahoud, might close all inlets to Aoun's zone to ban food supplies
for his army.
   Fuel supplies and money transfers to Aoun's enclave have been
banned by Hrawi's government since mid-July in a bid to force the
maverick general into submission.
   Hrawi, Aoun, Geagea and Lahoud are all Maronite Catholics, the
largest Christian sect in Lebanon. It has dominated power in
Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun has refused to recognize Hrawi, who was elected president
by parliament Nov. 24 with a mandate to enforce a peace plan
brokered by the Arab League to end 15 years of Moslem-Christian
civil war.
   Hrawi, who is backed by neighboring Syria, Lebanon's main power
broker, signed into law Friday a package of constitutional reforms
giving the 55 percent Moslem majority of Lebanon's 4 million
population an equal share of power for the first time since
independence.
   Hrawi called on Aoun to join the peace process or face a
military attack.
   The general said he would cooperate with Hrawi's government
``only when all Moslems and Christian militias that fought in the
civil war, including Geagea's Lebanese Forces, were disbanded.''

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Plotting to Kill Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Minnesota lab technician
has been charged with trying to hire an undercover police officer
to murder her parents so she could collect a $2 million
inheritance.
   Heidi Steiro appeared Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Franklin
Noel on a federal charge of trying to hire someone to cross a state
line to commit murder. She was held without bail, pending a
preliminary hearing and detention hearing today before Noel.
   The 21-year-old Steiro was arrested Friday by St. Paul police
and FBI special agents after meeting the undercover officer at a
St. Paul hotel.
   According to an affidavit filed in court by the FBI, an
informant told police Sgt. Thomas Dunaski last week that Steiro had
offered him money to kill her parents.
   The informant said he told Steiro that he would not do it
himself but would introduce her to someone who would, and he
arranged a meeting with Dunaski.
   At the hotel, Steiro told the undercover officer where her
parents lived in Boulder Junction, Wis., and what time they usually
go to bed.
   Steiro told the undercover officer she would pay him $45,000 to
kill Richard and Gloria Steiro. She then paid him $1,000 to cover
expenses, the affidavit said.
   As a final precaution, she telephoned her parents to be sure
they would be home over the weekend, according to the affidavit.
   During the meeting with Dunaski, Steiro referred to her parents
as her stepparents or adoptive parents, the affidavit said. After
her arrest, she acknowledged that they are her natural parents.
   ``Steiro stated she wanted her stepfather killed because she
would inherit about $2 million and because she hates him,'' the
affidavit said.
   Richard Steiro said the charge against his daughter was ``kind
of a sad thing. We'll leave it up to the authorities.'' He declined
to comment further.
   He is a former boat dealer in Boulder Junction, which is near
the border of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. His wife is a waitress at
a local restaurant. They also own a resort in northern Wisconsin.
   Authorities described Steiro as a former pre-dental student at
the university's College of Liberal Arts and a member of the
university marching band.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Down 0.8 Percent in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big-ticket''
durable goods dropped 0.8 percent in August, continuing the flat
performance that has gone on for 18 months, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -
items expected to last more than three years - totaled a seasonally
adjusted $127 billion following a revised 2.7 percent gain in July.
   But excluding defense and transportation, overall orders would
have fallen even steeper. Without either category, orders would
have dropped 1.6 percent, the department said.
   Many analysts had expected the overall decline in orders, which
have zigzagged throughout the year - up during three months and
down for four including a 10.5 percent plunge in January.
   Durable goods orders are a key economic barometer of
manufacturing industry plans for production. A decrease in orders
could result in a slump in that sector and subsequent layoffs.
   In fact, the Labor Department reported earlier that 45,000
factory jobs were lost in August. It was the 16th time out of 17
months that manufacturing jobs declined.
   Since reaching a post-recession peak in January 1989, the
manufacturing sector has lost 455,000 jobs, Labor said.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, often a
barometer of business plans to expand and modernize, plunged 11.2
percent to $35.4 billion after gaining 10.1 percent in July. But
excluding aircraft orders, the drop would have been only 4.4
percent.
   The pattern of orders in August was mixed. Both electrical
machinery and transportation categories posted gains while
non-electrical machinery and primary metals orders fell.
   Orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3 percent to $35.2
billion, mostly for motor vehicles. Aircraft orders fell about $3
billion. Transportation orders jumped 4.5 percent in July.
   Electrical machinery orders advanced 2.6 percent to $20.8
billion following a 1.5 percent gain a month earlier..
   But non-electrical machinery orders fell 6.1 percent to $21.2
billion after gaining 3.5 percent in July. And orders for primary
metals slipped 1.7 percent to $11.6 billion after rising 2.8
percent the previous month.
   The often-volatile defense category jumped 12.4 percent to $8.4
billion, following a 5.6 percent decline in July.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 2.9 percent to $128.7 billion in
August, most of which was motor vehicles. Shipments had fallen 1.8
percent in July.
   Unfilled orders edged down 0.3 percent to $499.3 billon after
gaining 0.6 percent a month earlier.

<HEAD>Riots Against Job Quotas Across Northern India; Singh Offers To
Talk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Student riots against new government job
quotas for lower caste groups today spread across northern India,
leaving at least five people dead.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh offered to meet students, hoping to
end the unrest, but authorities also tightened security in New
Delhi, mobilized troops and imposed curfews in four other cities.
   In a continuing wave of protest suicides, a student doused
himself with gasoline near New Delhi's police headquarters and lit
a match, inflicting burns over half his body before he was taken to
hospital.
   The students, mostly upper caste, believe they will lose coveted
civil service positions to less qualified Indians of lower castes,
for whom the Singh government has established an affirmative action
program reserving nearly half the jobs for them.
   Three people were killed and 25 wounded by police gunfire near
Meerut, 55 miles west of New Delhi, police told United News of
India. Two more people were killed in clashes with police in Jammu,
240 miles north of the capital.
   Residents and housewives in New Delhi joined students in the
streets of middle-class neighborhoods in confronting police and
shouting anti-government slogans.
   ``Go ahead students,'' some middle-aged women chanted. ``We are
with you.''
   One 80-year-old woman was trampled and injured in a stampede
when police fired tear gas and charged into a crowd of 2,000 people
with bamboo riot sticks, witnesses said.
   Major roads in the city of 8 million people were blocked by
police or by makeshift stone barricades erected by the students.
The state-owned Delhi Transport Company ordered its 4,000 buses off
the roads after losing dozens of vehicles to arson and stoning.
   Tourists were told all Delhi tours were canceled, and tours to
the Taj Mahal had to leave the city by 5 a.m. before the troubles
begin.
   The trouble has been simmering since Singh announced the quotas
Aug. 7. But tensions exploded following the death Tuesday of a
youth who set himself ablaze with gasoline in front of thousands of
witnesses the previous day.
   New Delhi witnessed the worst violence since the anti-Sikh riots
of 1984 in the wake of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's
assassination. Two students died from police gunfire on Tuesday.
   Another student consumed a fatal dose of poison Tuesday in the
city of Hissar, 80 miles east of New Delhi. It brought to four the
number of students who have killed themselves by self-immolation or
poison in the last week.

   Iran has called on Moslems around the
world to stage anti-American demonstrations on Friday to protest
the presence of the U.S.-led multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.
   The Islamic Propagation Organization said in a statement that
Moslems worldwide should protest ``the filthy presence of alien
troops in the Persian Gulf'' and Saudi Arabia, Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency reported today.
   Iran has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But it has
deplored the deployment of U.S. forces to prevent a possible Iraqi
attack on Saudi Arabia and to enforce a U.N.-imposed economic
embargo on Baghdad.
   The Iranians have been particularly angered at the presence of
non-Moslem forces in Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina,
Islam's holiest shrines.
   ``Would wolves guard the sheep?'' the statement asked, according
to the IRNA report, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   ``Oh Moslems, is it not the time to awake from slumber?'' it
asked.
   IRNA quoted the radical newspaper Jomhuri Islami as saying
demonstrations will celebrate Iraq's ``capitulation'' in a recent
peace treaty with Iran.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, facing the embargo and the
U.S.-led forces, suddenly made peace with Iran last month, formally
ending the 1980-88 war and two years of deadlocked peace talks.
   There will also be jubilation that ``Iraq, which was armed to
the teeth by Western countries, has now become a threat to the West
and deploys these same armaments against the West and those like
Kuwait which financed Iraq's war against Iran,'' Jomhuri Islami
said.
   ``Next Friday the whole country will be filled with the shouts
of `Death to America,' proving to the world that in the eyes of the
Moslem nation of Iran the United States is the main party
responsible for the imposition of war on Iran,'' the paper said.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist,
is believed to want to end more than a decade of anti-Western
sentiments in Iran to attract investment and technology for the
country's postwar economy. The protest call is seen as a show of
defiance by his vehemently anti-American radicals rivals.

   Somewhere between Florida and
Pennsylvania, the cremated remains of a man entrusted to the U.S.
Postal Service have disappeared.
   Adelaide Findlay says the urn holding the ashes of her uncle,
Earl H. Miller, 94, was mailed to her on July 16 by officials of
the Fairchild Funeral Home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The insured package never showed up in Birdsboro, a town of
3,500 about 10 miles southeast of Reading. Miller died July 10 in
Pompano Beach, Fla.
   ``It's been hectic and has worn on my health,'' Ms. Findlay
said. ``I'm afraid that waiting for the ashes to arrive is a lost
cause. And, I'm not going to sue because that would only upset me
more.''
   Ms. Findley had planned to inter the remains of her uncle in a
plot near his wife, Amelia R. Miller, who died in 1971. But for
now, the grave remains empty.
   ``The last several months of his life were hectic for him. And
even in death, it's hectic for him,'' Ms. Findlay said.
   The funeral home has filed a claim with the Postal Service to
begin tracing the package.
   ``Once they file a claim, the trace would start at the post
office branch it was mailed from, and we would check both states'
dead-letter branches,'' said Tina Carmody of the Fort Lauderdale
post office.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines at ``the tip
of the spear'' defending Saudi oilfields were told by their boss
today to expect a long desert stay.
   ``I don't want to hear about any more questions about how long
you're going to be here,'' Commandant Gen. Alfred Gray told Marines
at a combat support camp in the northern Saudi desert near the main
highways to the country's major oil installations.
   He also said the Marines should be prepared to shift to offense
if the kingdom is attacked.
   Gray, speaking to reporters after his 45-minute pep talk, said
he was confident the multinational force in Saudi Arabia and the
gulf region could stop any Iraqi offensive. But he refused to say
whether the U.S.-led forces were capable of pushing Iraq out of
Kuwait, saying the question was speculative.
   During his speech to the men, Gray said: ``We have a very, very
powerful, flexible and most useful force, afloat and ashore, ready
to do whatever needs to be done. We're going to play for keeps if
that is required.''
   For now, he said, the mission was defensive and 13 ships were
headed to the region with supplies needed to sustain the Marine
force.
   But should hostilities break out, Gray said: ``We all know the
best defense is a good offense.''
   Gray's pep talk, delivered through a bullhorn, was full of
praise for the Marines, but equally rich with reminders that their
stay in the desert is unlikely to end soon.
   ``How long are we going to be here?'' he asked rhetorically.
``Well, we're going to be here until we get done what has to be
done.''
   He then essentially ordered the troops not to complain.
   ``There will be no morale problem ... because I say there will
be morale. There will also be no boredom.''
   Gray said that under normal circumstances Marines are deployed
for six months and then brought home for 15 to 18 months.
   ``It would make sense if we could hold to that as best we can,''
Gray told reporters. ``But we may not b able to because we have,
as I tried to indicate, enormous global commitments. I think they
understand that.''
   Another complication would be the need to coordinate with the
Navy to make sure enough ships were available to make the personnel
changes, he said.
   ``I'm well aware there comes a point when you need a change of
scenery,'' he said, suggesting that change could come within Saudi
Arabia. ``Let your commandant worry about that.''
   Gray reminded the Marines to be on guard against possible
terrorist attacks, saying: ``Marines are always the No. 1 target in
this part of the world for terrorist attack.''
   ``You're the tip of the spear,'' he said.
   Gray said he believed the American deployment had persuaded
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to continue into Saudi Arabia
after taking Kuwait Aug.2.
   ``I believe that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi military fully
intended to invade this region of Saudi Arabia,'' he declared.
   ``They didn't. They've been stopped. ... You've won a big one
already and you haven't had to fire a shot.''

   Former U.S. Sen. John A. Danaher,
who died Saturday, was remembered by his family and friends as a
fair-minded federal judge, an outspoken senator and a beloved
family man.
   ``His mind was so wide and awesome that I could never reach deep
enough to grasp it,'' granddaughter Ann Danaher Connelly told more
than 150 family members and friends gathered for funeral services
Tuesday at the Church of St. Peter Claver.
   The former senator and federal appeals court judge died Saturday
at age 91 at a convalescent home in West Hartford. A spokesman for
the family said he died of complications stemming from a broken
hip.
   During the Catholic service, Monsignor John S. Kennedy said
Danaher's career was ``distinguishing and garlanded with the
tributes of his peers.''
   Born to a prominent political family in Meriden in 1899, Danaher
graduated from Yale University and Yale School of Law. From 1921 to
1933, he was an assistant U.S. attorney. In 1935, he was elected
Connecticut's secretary of state.
   He was a Republican U.S. senator for Connecticut from 1939 to
1945. After leaving office, he practiced law with his own firm in
Washington, Danaher, Fahey and Poole, before being appointed to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in 1954. He retired in 1983.
   Danaher was prominently mentioned as a potential nominee to the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1956 and 1957 when President Eisenhower
nominated William J. Brennan Jr. and Charles E. Whittaker to the
court.
   Survivors include Danaher's wife of 69 years, Dorothy King
Danaher; two sons, John A. Danaher Jr. of Groton, and Robert C.
Danaher of West Hartford; his daughter, Jeanne D. Lennhoff of West
Hartford; 13 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.

   Hispanic leaders are planning ways to present
a united political voice in the 1992 presidential election.
   About 100 Hispanic leaders met Tuesday and resolved not to let
divisions within the community sap their political strength, as
some say occurred during the presidential campaign two years ago.
   Led by former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros; Bronx, N.Y.,
Borough President Fernando Ferrer; and Denver Mayor Federico Pena,
the leaders adopted a blueprint for 1992 and took stands on five
pressing Hispanic issues.
   The leaders plan to establish the National Hispanic Agenda as an
organization that can speak on political issues all Hispanics
share.
   ``It represents an attempt to speak with one voice across the
differences that divide the Hispanic community - Cubans, Puerto
Ricans, Mexicans, Republicans, Democrats, New Yorkers, Floridians,
Texans, Californians,'' Cisneros said.
   As a first step, the leaders urged an adjustment of the 1990
census that appears to have undercounted minorities. They also
pressed for passage of the civil rights bill and repeal of the
employer sanctions provision in the 1986 immigration law.
   ``The Hispanic subgroups are now agreeing and supporting issues
in a real call for unity,'' said Robert Calderin, director of a
conference of New York legislators called Somos Uno, Spanish for
``We Are One.''
   ``It's the first time we have had a cohesive group of people
working together,'' said David Pena, a Miami attorney who attended
the meeting on behalf of the Hispanic National Bar Association.
   ``Our hope is to develop a shared agenda and be united,'' said
Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza, a
Washington-based research and advocacy group.
   Hispanic leaders want to make sure their political potential is
not squandered in 1992, Cisneros said.
   ``This is the starting of a process that leads to a 1992 policy
statement that is useful in the presidential election ... and that
has come from a deliberate and systematic dialogue with community
organizations all around the country,'' he said.
   At 21 million, Hispanics comprise the fastest-growing minority
group in the country. Demographers estimate Hispanics ill become
the largest minority population sometime this decade.
   The 100 Hispanic leaders at the National Hispanic Agenda meeting
represented Republicans and Democrats and groups as varied as the
U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   The leaders praised President Bush's executive order, signed
Monday, setting up an advisory committee to develop ways to improve
education of Hispanics. But they said Bush should make sure young
Spanish-speaking children are able to learn in their native
language.
   The leaders also urged Congress to pass legislation giving a
statehood plebiscite, or vote, to Puerto Rico and allow Puerto
Ricans in the continental United States to participate. Polls
indicate a slight majority of Puerto Ricans favor statehood.
   Bush, who backs statehood for Puerto Rico, has urged Congress to
pass legislation mandating that whatever Puerto Ricans decide be
implemented by 1993. A bill allowing the plebiscite is pending on
the House floor, but a similar Senate measure is mired in
committee.

   Iraq bitterly attacked its former ally
the Soviet Union today and said Arabs would not be friendly toward
a country in ``the alliance of American hostility.''
   The tirade by the official Iraqi News Agency was in response to
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardadze's speech Tuesday to the
United Nations. The news agency claimed the Soviets were bribed to
make the comments.
   In another development, Baghdad radio broadcast President Saddam
Hussein's message to the American people, parts of which were aired
on U.S. television on Tuesday night.
   Also, officials announced there will be more food rationing
starting this weekend because of the U.N. trade embargo imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Trade and Finance Minister Mohammed
Mahdi Saleh said the rationing will include rice, flour, cooking
oil, sugar and tea.
   ``In a tone that clearly shows the bribe given by American and
its allies the oil sheiks, USSR Foreign Minister Shevardnadze spoke
from the United Nations forum in a threatening voice,'' the Iraqi
News Agency said.
   ``We tell Shevardnadze, if you are not concerned about the
relations of friendship with the Arabs and want to be dragged into
the alliance of American hostility, then the Arabs will not be
concerned about the likes of you.''
   Shevardnadze, who sits at President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's right
hand in the Soviet power structure, criticized Saddam as a
terrorist threatening the world order and suggested his seizure of
Kuwait might call for a war crimes trial. The Soviet minister also
raised the prospect of U.N. military force against Iraq if economic
sanctions fail to force Saddam to give up Kuwait.
   ``The United Nations has the power to suppress acts of
aggression,'' Shevardnadze said in his speech at the United
Nations.
   During the Cold War standoff between the United States and the
Soviet Union, Iraq was a chief Middle East ally of Moscow, which
was the main arms supplier to Saddam Hussein's military.
   The Soviet Union announced it would stop supplying arms to
Baghdad after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, but at first was
hesitant to back economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Gorbachev and President Bush agreed two weeks ago in Helsinki,
Finland, that additional measures might be required. One result was
the U.N. air embargo approved by the Security Council on Tuesday.
   Baghdad radio denounced the air embargo today and said it was
imposed ``on the directives of the hostile policy'' of Bush.
   Saddam's message to the American people defended the invasion of
Kuwait and said it was not without warning.
   The 75-minute message was featured on newscasts from Baghdad and
was to be broadcast on Iraqi television tonight, the Iraqi News
Agency said.
   ``Kuwait constitutes the southern part of Iraq, which was
severed by the British in 1913, in preparation for the first world
war,'' he said.
   ``The rulers of Kuwait exploited our preoccupation with the war
between us and Iran to expand further at our expense, by using our
southern oilfields to acquire new oil wells from which to funnel
additional oil for their benefit.
   ``No warning, however repeatedly stated, could deter them from
that course of action,'' Saddam said.
   Saddam's message was delivered in Washington on Tuesday.
Excerpts were aired on the major American networks, and the Cable
News Network decided to show the entire message early today.

<HEAD>Three Senators Say They'll Vote Against Souter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Eastern liberal senators today announced
they will vote against confirming the nomination of Judge David
Souter to the Supreme Court, based on his failure to endorse the
right to abortion.
   ``The right of privacy is a basic promise of American life,''
said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. ``We should not entrust it to a
jurist who cannot agree whether it exists or to whom it applies.''
   Bradley was joined by New Jersey Democratic colleague Frank
Lautenberg and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of two women in the
Senate. Mikulski said that because Souter refused to state his
position on abortion, ``we must fear the worst.''
   The announcements brought to only four the number of senators to
publicly oppose President Bush's nominee. Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., on Monday became the first senator to say he would vote
against Souter.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Thursday. No
members of that panel have said they will oppose Souter and seven
of its 14 members have said they will vote in favor.
   The nominee, a 51-year-old New Hampshire jurist, also picked up
more support today from senators not on the committee. Sens. Alan
Dixon, D-Ill., and Terry Sanford, D-N.C., said they favored Souter.

   An assistant restaurant manager fed up with
hordes of teen-agers at her Pizza Hut locked the doors and
collected $1 each from youths unaccompanied by adults, but the
national chain ended the policy.
   Susan Gamlin, manager of the Pizza Hut in Baden, about 15 miles
northwest of Pittsburgh, said her assistant instituted the cover
charge because unruly teens were disrupting the eatery after
football games and high school dances.
   ``We didn't think a dollar was too much to ask from kids who
destroy our dining room every Friday night,'' Ms. Gamlin said.
   ``The kids dump the salt and pepper shakers, only order bread
sticks and water, try to bring in food from McDonald's, don't wait
to be seated and then complain about not having a waitress.''
   She declined to name the assistant, who no longer works at the
restaurant. She would not say whether his departure was related to
the incident.
   Roger Rydell, a spokesman at the chain's Wichita, Kan.,
headquarters, said it was wrong to collect the fee.
   ``There are no cover charges at Pizza Hut,'' he said. ``And
there won't be any locked doors until we close for business for
good.''
   Judy Campbell, whose son, Brian, was one of the youths who paid
the fee Friday night, said she was ``very upset.''
   ``The kids in this area have no place else to go,'' she said.
   Baden Borough Secretary Sue Blum said she contacted Fire Chief
Gene Miketa about parents' complaints. Police Chief Frank Tavern
also was investigating.

   The last three female crew members of a
British Airways flight stranded in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion
left for home today along with eight other British women and
children evacuated from Iraq.
   They were among 185 people who arrived in Amman aboard a regular
Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad. The 11 Britons left about two
hours later on a commercial flight to London.
   One young woman sobbed uncontrollably when she got off the
flight from Iraq and had to be supported by two unidentified
British officials as she walked to the airport VIP lounge to await
the flight to London.
   ``You can tell the world we are very worried,'' one of the women
told reporters as she wheeled a stroller toward the gate for the
flight to Britain.
   None of the women would talk with reporters about their ordeal
in Kuwait or Iraq.
   However, a British Airways official, who declined to be
identified, said the three flight attendants had been held at a
camp in Iraq. He said they were driven to the airport in Kuwait by
Iraqi authorities for a flight to Baghdad.
   The British Airways crew members were on a stopover in Kuwait
when Iraq invaded Aug. 2. It was not immediately clear why the
three flight attendants had not been evacuated earlier.
   Some of their fellow flight attendants were aboard a special
evacuation flight that left Baghdad for Paris, London and
Washington on Aug. 31.
   Two of them told reporters at Baghdad that they had been held
along with about 20 other people at a potential military target in
Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that foreign women and
children are free to leave Iraq. Western men, however, are being
held captive in the country as hostages against a possible American
attack.
   Iraqi officials say some of the Western men have been moved to
potential military targets around the country. Western diplomats in
Baghdad say they do not know how many people are being held
hostage.

<HEAD>Cambodian Prime Minister Says His Forces Should Keep Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen today
rejected a compromise peace proposal from the guerrilla coalition
battling his government and said his forces should keep fighting,
state radio reported.
   The proposal Hun Sen rejected concerns the formation of the
Supreme National Council that will help guide Cambodia through new
elections under a plan approved by the United Nations.
   Hun Sen turned down a proposal that guerrilla leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk join the council as chairman in exchange for
another seat for Hun Sen's government, saying his side also should
be given the council vice chairmanship. That ruined hopes that the
council would resume meetings soon. The council now has 12
representatives from the warring factions.
   ``We should continue the fight,'' Hun Sen said, according to a
Cambodian radio broadcast monitored in Bangkok. ``The enemies do
not yet have the good will to end the war and to support a
cease-fire.''
   The report said Hun Sen made the comments in a speech to a
``mass meeting'' in front of Phnom Penh's former royal palace.
   His Vietnamese-installed government is fighting an 11-year-old
war against the coalition of three guerrilla groups - the forces of
Sihanouk, the Khmer People's National Lieration Front of former
Premier Son Sann, and the Khmer Rouge, led by Khieu Samphan.
   Both sides say they accept the U.N. peace plan, under which the
United Nations would administer the country until elecions are
held.
   On Sept. 10, six government members and six guerrilla members
formed the Supreme National Council. But its first meeting, held
last week in Bangkok, collapsed in bickering over the role of
Sihanouk.
   The guerrillas said the former head of state must chair the
council because he is widely considered the central figure in any
settlement.
   On Friday, Sihanouk urged his guerrilla allies to offer Phnom
Penh another council seat if Sihanouk joined as chairman.
   The guerrilla groups formally agreed to that in a meeting Sunday
and said they wanted a second meeting of the council as soon as
possible.
   Hun Sen said today he could agree to the proposal only if his
government received the seat of vice chairman.
   Both sides have said the next meeting should decide the
chairmanship, appoint a delegation to take Cambodia's seat at the
United Nations and then work on other issues including stopping
fighting.
   The United Nations seat is held by the guerrillas, but they are
ready to transfer it to the council. The deadline for the
presentation of the new credentials is Oct. 18.
   Sihanouk, who has stayed at his Beijing home during recent
negotiations, says he will attend the council meeting after he is
elected chairman, spokesmen in his office said.
   Thailand was annoyed by the failure of the first council
meeting, and said it will host another meeting only if it is clear
beforehand there will be agreement.

   One worker told jokes; another spied on
a gunman from behind an ice machine. After seven hours, they were
among 20 people to emerge unhurt from a McDonald's restaurant that
had been under seige.
   The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Monday as assistant manager
Ramiro Gironas served up two Big Macs, some french fries and a soft
drink to a man with tattooed arms.
   ``Just like a regular customer,'' Gironas said Tuesday. ``He
stood in line and waited to be helped, just like everyone else.''
   Police allege the man, Douglas Eric Girard, 32, held 20 people
hostage inside the restaurant before he was subdued by sheriff's
deputies shortly after midnight Monday.
   Girard and Frank M. Teresi, 38, allegedly had robbed a nearby
Kids' Mart clothing store of $200, police said. Both were booked
for investigation of armed robbery and false imprisonment,
authorities said.
   Bail for Girard was set at $500,000. Teresi, already on parole
for robbery and being under the influence of a narcotic, was placed
on a no-bail parole hold, said police Sgt. John Ortega.
   As the man gave Gironas change for his food, other McDonald's
cashiers spotted a .38-caliber revolver tucked in his back pocket,
Gironas recalled. Someone noticed wads of bills in his socks, he
said.
   ``He's got a gun!'' a cashier yelled. Customers dove under
tables or fled the restaurant, authorities said.
   Eleven employees and one customer hid in the basement, and
authorities said Girard forced the remaining eight people to lie on
the floor.
   Gironas, 21, herded employees to the back of the restaurant,
then sought refuge beside a half-ton ice machine and dialed police.
The native of Cochabamba, Bolivia, only recently learned English
but reported the gunman's every move to officers.
   ``All I knew was to take care of my people, my crew,'' Gironas
said. ``I'm glad I'm safe and that all my people are safe. . . . I
just did what I had to.''
   The gunman paced the restaurant, smoking a cigarette and peering
out windows, said police Lt. Ron Ingels. He apparently kept the
pistol inside a waistband and made no threats, Ingels said.
   Downstairs, assistant manager Anis Hussain, 25, tried some
comedy on his fellow hostages. Hussain, who occasionally crept
upstairs to check on the situation, said he hoped his jokes would
relieve the stress.
   ``I was just trying to comfort them and to convince them that
everything was going to be fine,'' he said. He added that he drew
some chuckles.
   Both employees said they were spotted by the gunman, but that he
never bothered them.
   ``Clearly, he could see us,'' Hussain said.
   At 11:30 p.m., special weapons officers urged Gironas by
telephone to have the group in the basement leave through an
emergency door.
   Once they were out, SWAT officers, each having studied
restaurant floor plans, crept into the restaurant unseen by the
gunman, authorities said.
   Deputies lobbed ``flash-bang'' grenades to disorient the man,
and Deputy Jim Harrell leaped over a counter and wrestled the
gunman to the ground. Not a shot was fired.
   ``This is what we train for,'' said Harrell. ``Scared isn't the
right word for it. You're just really hyped up. Your senses are
really keen.''
   Police said they found a .38-caliber revolver stashed in a
bathroom.
   McDonald's officials said the restaurant opened for business as
usual at 6 a.m. Tuesday.

   The book whose distribution Israel's government
tried to stop will be listed as the No. 1 non-fiction best seller
in The New York Times' Book Review list of Oct. 7.
   The list reflects sales for the week ending Sept. 22, the Times
said today. The previous week a judge had temporarily barred the
book's distribution, but an appeals court struck down his order two
days later.
   The book, ``By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer,'' written a one-time Mossad employee, Victor
Ostrovsky, purports to reveal secrets of the Israeli intelligence
agency.
   Israel had maintained the book's publication would endanger the
lives of some of its agents.
   Bookstores were swamped with requests for the book when it went
on sale Sept. 13. It has become the fastest-selling title of its
U.S. publisher, St. Martin's Press, which so far has printed
325,000 copies.
   A ban against distribution of the book in Canada, where
Ostrovsky lives, was dropped in Toronto a few days after the New
York court action.

<HEAD>Jordan: Will Abide by Air Embargo Against Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jordan said today it would abide by a U.N.
Security Council order to cut off air traffic in and out of Iraq
and occupied Kuwait. But it permitted an Iraqi Airways flight to
land.
   The regularly scheduled flight from Baghdad carried 185 people,
and it was not immediately clear what its cargo hold contained.
   But Jordanian officials said an initial check of the U.N.
resolution indicated the arrival was not a violation of the air
embargo.
   ``The embargo is on cargo shipments only and not passengers,''
said one Jordanian Cabinet minister, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``According to our initial studying of the resolution,
we understand that it does not bar human traffic.''
   The Security Council voted 14-1 Tuesday to prohibit air traffic
with Iraq and Kuwait. Cuba cast the only vote against the
resolution.
   The resolution does not mention passenger planes but says that
all planes traveling to and from Iraq should be checked to make
sure they are not carrying cargo prohibited by the U.N. trade
sanctions. The resolution prohibits the use of force to stop
planes, but allows for the detention of aircraft.
   Under certain conditions, the council permitted humanitarian
cargo, including food and medical supplies.
   An unidentified Jordanian Transport Ministry official was quoted
by the state news agency Petra as saying: ``The civil aviation
authority and concerned government departments will implement this
resolution.''
   The resolution also called on all member states to bar flights
from their territory to those nations, and deny landing rights to
planes coming from Iraq or Kuwait.

   The Daily Record, Morristown, N.J., on political trust:
   The Times Mirror survey, ``The People, the Press and Politics
1990,'' ... provides some sobering news - and perhaps an ominous
portent - for politicians of every political stripe.
   The survey charts a continuing erosion of trust and confidence
in our two major political parties, a deepening cynicism and
economic polarization that ``threatens to subvert traditional
partisan politics or block the effective resolution of social and
economic issues.''
   Respondents to the survey characterized Democrats as incapable
of governing effectively, and the Republicans as a political
instrument of the rich and powerful. A pox on both houses.
   What is the impact of all this? Well, one effect has been
obvious for years. People have stopped voting. Eligible voters show
their cynicism by staying away from the polls. More and more people
are being elected by fewer and fewer Americans.
   Those who do vote re-elect incumbents virtually across the
board.
   People who have really had enough may be more inclined to vote
against any and all incumbents regardless of their political
stripe.
   That's what the Times Mirror survey is saying they might do - if
they vote at all.

   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on the budget:
   The droning noise coming out of Washington, D.C.'s budget
negotiations may put the public to sleep, but we'll wake up with a
jolt when we see what Congress' inaction has done to us.
   Unless Congress and the president act before Oct. 1 on a new
budget that meets Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting goals, automatic
cuts of about $100 billion will cause layoffs and massive cuts in
programs that no one wants to cut. That's when we'll wake up and
ask our senators and representatives why we must endure inaction at
a time of fiscal crisis in our country.
   They will reply that no one wants to approve tax increases and
cut budgets so close to an election. We reply that if you don't do
something, we'll vote you out of office, not for what you did but
for what you didn't do.

   Sept. 23
   The Sun Herald, Gulfport, Miss., on the budget:
   The indecisiveness of congressional leaders fumbling around with
the federal budget may be the highest form of power politics in
Washington, but outside the beltway, it is inflicting cruel
economic pain and mental anguish on the federal workers who keep
the government running.
   The victims of this shabby treatment include thousands of
government employees.
   If they were working for a private employer who treated them
that way even one time, let alone year after year for a decade or
more, those same congressional leaders would be calling televised
hearings and passing laws to punish the offending companies.
   But because it is Congress itself that is causing the misery,
there'll be no hearings, no laws, no alphabet agency given the task
of assuring no repetitions of the employee mistreatment. ...
   But Congress has been working on the task since last January,
when President Bush released his budget proposal. After eight
months, Congress doesn't seem much closer to agreement than when it
started.
   Little time remains before the Oct. 1 deadline for tee
Gramm-Rudman automatic cuts to kick in. Negotiators must reach a
deal and Congress must ratify it or Gramm-Rudman will mandate cuts
of up to 40 percent in domestic and military programs.
   To prepare for that contingency, the government is planning to
furlough employees, that is, put them on unpaid leave.
   The silver lining in this dark fiscal cloud is the high
probability that Congress will not allow the Gramm-Rudman cuts to
happen. The members can't stand the political heat. At the last
minute, they will find some way ... to keep government operating
and avoid the wrath of mistreated employees. ...
   The saddest part is that voters will undoubtedly re-elect most
of those so-called leaders who will, in all likelihood, repeat the
sordid performance next year.

   Shawano (Wis.) Evening Leader on females in the military:
   If Iraqi troops attack U.S. forces situated in the Saudi Arabian
desert, women may be among the first casualties.
   Although regulations prohibit females from combat, the U.S.
forces sent to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield
include many women. ...
   In the Saudi desert, U.S. women are repairing communications,
arming attack planes and operating supply lines. Those areas are
deemed safe by the military brass.
   But if the Iraqis would strike against the U.S. troops, those
areas probably would be the first to be hit.
   The uncertain future of the Gulf Crisis has not frazzled the
females who are temporarily stationed in the Middle East. Both
women and men serve together in the different branches of the U.S.
Armed Forces, and the females have noted they want to be treated as
equals. ...
   Policies for military women must be adjusted to meet those
changes in the U.S. Armed Forces. If a woman wants to serve and is
trained to do so, her superiors should be allowed to use her
without a second thought.
   If females are going to be recruited, trained and sent to a
crisis situation, it seems foolish to protect them from injury
while male troops are allowed to fight.
   ``We get paid the same,'' noted a female Army lieutenant who was
deployed as part ofestment firm Capital Insight, said trading was volatile,
with
bonds buffetted by rumors on subjects ranging from the Middle East
crisis to the budget deficit stalemate.
   He said bonds picked up support from Tuesday's rebound in the
dollar. The overnight selloff on the Tokyo stock market steered
investors into U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, including
government bonds, he said.
   ``The market is just jittery about the Middle East and the
budget,'' he said. ``There are a lot of rumors, no facts this
morning except the durable goods number which I'm not sure anyone
cared about.''
   Two Commerce Department reports released today confirmed that
the economy lacks vigor.
   The report on durable goods showed orders to U.S. factories for
long-lasting, generally expensive items dropped 0.8 percent in
August. Separately, the department reported U.S. personal incomes
rose just 0.3 percent in August, the slowest pace in four months,
while consumer spending rose 0.5 percent, the lowest in three
months.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term
issues and intermediate maturities ranged from 1-32 point lower to
1-32 point higher. Long-term issues were unchanged to up 1-16
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 0.39 to 1,136.45 by late
morning.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.58 percent as the
discount edged 1 basis point lower to 7.35 percent. Yields
six-month bills edged down to 7.77 percent as the discount dipped 1
basis point to 7.39 percent. Yields on one-year bills were
unchanged at 7.85 percent as the discount remained steady at 7.32
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another
for overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from late
Tuesday.

   A defense attorney described Robert
Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photos in detail to gauge the
reactions of prospective jurors at the nation's first obscenity
trial of an art gallery and its director.
   The Contemporary Ars Center and director Dennis Barrie are
charged with obscenity and displaying nude photos of children at a
Mapplethorpe exhibit.
   Defense lawyers today rejected a prospective juror as jury
selection moved into the third day. Marc Mezibov, the gallery's
lawyer, used a peremptory challenge to remove a retiree, who he
said was not adequately familiar with the community's contemporary
social standards.
   Eight jurors and two alternates are being sought.
   On Tuesday, prosecutors used one of their peremptory challenges
to dismiss a prospective juror who viewed the Mapplethorpe photo
exhibit.
   Prosecutor Frank Prouty sought to have the prospective juror
removed ``for cause.'' Each side is allowed six peremptory removals
for which they need to give no reason, and an unlimited number of
challenges for cause, in which they must convince a judge that the
juror is unbiased.
   Seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit are the basis for the
criminal charges. One photo shows a man urinating into another
man's mouth. Others show anal penetration with objects and other
homosexual or sadomasochistic images.
   After describing the seven photographs in detail, lawyer H.
Louis Sirkin asked several prospective jurors, ``Are you willing to
see those photographs before making a decision as to whether any of
them is obscene?''
   All answered that they were.
   Sirkin said later that he didn't describe the photographs for
shock value, although he was interested in seeing the potential
jurors' reaction.
   He did not say what he believed the reactions were.
   ``The jury is entitled to know what the photographs show,''
Sirkin said. ``If they're going to see them, they have a right to
know what's in them.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union and the Association of Art
Museum Directors have said this is the nation's first obscenity
prosecution they know of involving an art gallery.
   If convicted, Barrie, 43, could get a year in jail and a fine of
$2,000. The gallery could be fined $10,000.
   The Mapplethope exhibit, now concluding a national tour in
Boston, drew more than 80,000 viewers during its seven-week
Cincinnati exhibition ending in May. The artist died of AIDS last

   Mezibov tried to determine whether potential jurors had opinions
about the role of an art museum and the types of photographs that
should be allowed to be exhibited.
   He asked if they would be willing to listen to opinions from art
experts from outside Cincinnati, particularly regarding sexually
graphic photographs.
   ``Yes, but I have the right to accept or reject those
opinions,'' one man said.
   Mezibov asked another prospective juror if there should be laws
governing what adults are allowed to say.
   ``I've never seen anything I thought there should be a law
against,'' the woman said.

<HEAD>Canadian Auto Workers Set Strike Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Auto Workers union today set an Oct.
10 strike deadline for reaching a new labor agreement with General
Motors Corp.'s Cnadian subsidiary.
   The Canadian Auto Workers members last weekend ratified a new
contract with Ford of Canada after a six-day strike by about 12,800
workers.
   It's expected the union will use that contract as a pattern for
negotiations with General Motors of Canada Ltd., which has about
36,000 workers covered by the Canadian Auto Workers national
contract.
   Union President Bob White said today that a strike next month at
GM's 12 facilities in Canada is possibile.
   ``We should not fall into a false sense of security,'' White
said.
   GM has said it wants to shut its Scarborough, Ontario, van
assembly plant next year and cut 700 jobs from its Windsor,
Ontario, trim plant. White said negotiations with GM would focus on
saving jobs from those two factories.
   ``The agreement reached at Ford is an expensive proposition,''
said Rick Curd, vice president of personnel for GM of Canada. The
company, he added today, wants improvements in
cost-competitiveness, workplace flexibility and worker attendance.
   In the United States, meanwhile, United Auto Workers union
members at GM plants today continued voting on a proposed
three-year agreement reached Sept. 17. That pact appeared headed to
an overwhelming ratification margin. Voting should be completed by
Sunday.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on U.S. military cutbacks:
   While the dwindling imperatives of the Soviet threat and the
escalating imperatives of a financial crunch do make a reduction of
Washington's foreign military commitments inevitable, many Asian
countries are worried over how America retreats.
   They hope that U.S. policy-makers, keeping these fears in mind,
will find mechanisms to ensure that their country's shrinking
global reach does not trigger off instability in Pacific Asia.
   Given the fact that an eventual U.S. withdrawal from Clark and
Subic Bay appears, in the absence of dramatic geopolitical changes,
to be a fait accompli, the question must be whether alternative
forms of presence are possible that preserve America's stake in the
region. A more limited, perhaps rotational, presence in the
Philippines could be one answer; a shift to other permanent bases
in Pacific Asia that facilitate the rapid deployment of U.S. forces
could be another.
   Guam and, conceivably, New Zealand are candidates for such a
role. Singapore's and Brunei's offer of facilities to the U.S.
military, while a contribution to retaining American interest in
regional stability, cannot make up for the loss of the
strategically far superior sites in the Philippines.
   A permanent U.S. presence in Asia is thus a necessity, and the
shape of that presence must keep in mind the unclear contours of
the new world that is arriving.

   Tass, the Soviet news agency, on a nuclear weapons test ban:
   The complete ban on nuclear testing would be the simplest and
most effective measure for arms control. ... Their termination
would stop the creation of new systems of weapons of mass
destruction and would prevent upgrading old systems.
   The Soviet Union more than once stated its readiness for any
negotiations that would promote a universal and complete ban on
nuclear explosions. ... Moscow, for instance, proposed lowering the
yields of test explosions and the maximum number of tests per year.
...
   The Soviet Union is prepared to resume a moratorium on nuclear
explosions on a reciprocal basis with the United States. The Soviet
Union has already substantially cut its program of nuclear testing.
There have been no nuclear explosions at Soviet test ranges for
about a year.
   There are now particularly favorable conditions for settling the
question of nuclear tests. The Cold War is fading into the past.
The main obstacles with which the U.S. justified its refusal to
agree to complete a ban on nuclear explosions have been eliminated.
   Washington should no longer be concerned about problems involved
in verifying the observance of a ban on explosions. The Soviet
Union is prepared to accept any verification procedure. ...
   The talks in Geneva have approached a stage where their further
progress is complicated by differences in the final goals pursued
by the sides. The Soviet Union sees the main task to be banning
tests, while the U.S. side only seeks to work out measures to
monitor their continuation. ...
   An end to nuclear explosions remains elusive. Is not it time for
the U.S. administration to relate its stance on nuclear testing to
present-day realities?

   The Guardian, London, on the Soviet Union:
   The great debate in Moscow would make a thrilling tale of
dialectical passion, if it were not such a desperate affair. The
stakes are enormous: the economic well-being and political
integrity of the world's second superpower.
   The arguments on both sides are compelling but not decisive.
Either alternative - the slow road of reform advocated by Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, or the fast track pressed by economist
Stanislav Shatalin - could come fatally unstuck.
   The central figure, still attractive to us but no longer
unchallenged, remains President Mikhail Gorbachev, grappling with a
problem which may this time prove too massive for even his skills
in political manipulation.
   If we can forget about the Gulf crisis for a moment, we have to
recognize that the crisis facing the Soviet people could explode
just as catastrophically if ... Gorbachev takes the wrong path. ...
   Almost any economic program might improve life for the Soviet
people if there were the political will to implement it. ...
   Gorbachev's adoption ... of special powers both to tackle the
economic crisis and maintain public order is a last throw. We wish
him luck, but he now needs five aces in one hand to succeed.

   Daily Nation, Nairobi, Kenya, on South African President F.W. de
Klerk's visit to the United States:
   South Africa is looking to the United States to help end its
isolation by the rest of the world.
   The question, however, is whether time is ripe for the United
States and the rest of the world to consider lifting the sanctions
against Pretoria.
   We say it is not.
   President George Bush, who appeared warmer toward de Klerk than
he did toward the deputy president of the African National
Congress, Nelson Mandela, when he visited Washington in June, must
be reminded that apartheid is still very much in place.
   Bush must be be reminded that Pretoria is no less humane, no
less violent, or less racist than it has been in the past.

<TEXT>
   A traditional healer drowned because his
followers thought his magical powers enabled him to breath under
water for 48 hours, police said Wednesday.
   Lovemore Mpofu, 40, drowned during a tribal cleansing ceremonyaat a
dam in southwest Zimbabwe, said a police spokesman who was not
identified.
   When Mpofu plunged into the water but did not resurface, his
followers believed it to be part of the ceremony, the spokesman
said.
   The followers, who were ``trainees'' of the traditional healer,
danced and sang on the banks of the dam for two days as they
awaited his return.
   Relatives of the traditional healer evidently told police they
believed he was killed by a mermaid living in the dam.
   Traditional healers, or n'angas in the local Shona language, are
better known in the West as witchdoctors.

<HEAD>It's Time for the Annual Last-Minute Federal Budget Hysteria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's that time of fiscal year again, the
government poised for paralysis and the autumnal sky ready to crash
down on the nation's unsuspecting citizens.
   The stage is set, as usual, for 11th-hour budget chaos. But this
round is a little different: many federal programs may actually be
cut - by nearly one-third.
   ``The public doesn't have the slightest idea of what's coming.
We're talking about a serious disruption in government service,''
said Stan Collender, director of federal budget policy for the
Price Waterhouse accounting firm.
   Forget eye-glazing phrases like deficit reduction, budget
negotiations and Gramm-Rudman sequesters. If Congress and President
Bush don't agree on tax hikes and spending cuts by Monday, the
government shrinks - drastically and instantly.
   For anyone who thinks that's a great idea, here are a few things
to consider:
   -The Federal Aviation Administration would have to reduce from
40,000 to 34,000 the flights handled by 41 major airports and close
down 250 weather stations at night, forcing cancellation of night
flights.
   -The Agriculture Department would have to lower subsidies for
major commodities, lay off chicken inspectors and close for two
days a week the local offices where needy farmers get housing and
operating loans.
   -The Department of Health and Human Services would have to cut
Medicare payments by 2 percent. Medicare and Social Security checks
would be delayed due to personnel cuts.
   -The Bureau of Prisons would have difficulty running federal
prisons on a reduced staff. The Marshals Service wouldn't be able
to chase as many fugitives or seize as many criminal assets.
   Few budget-watchers expect Draconian cuts to last long, if they
materialize at all. The White House is hoping the mere threat of
such a cataclysm - technically known as a sequester - will force an
agreement sooner rather than later.
   But the choices are not pretty, particularly for those lawmakers
facing the voters in five weeks. They can support a budget
agreement that doubtless will raise taxes and reduce services. They
can resist compromise, triggering the drastic spending cuts. Or
they can extend the deadline for the automatic cuts, admitting
failure and postponing the inevitable moment of truth.
   ``Any decision is politically painful - even doing nothing,''
said Collender.
   This would not be the first time a budget impasse dragged beyond
the start of a fiscal year, triggering automatic cuts under the
1985 Gramm-Rudman law. But the scale this year is something
entirely new.
   In 1986, there was an $11.7 billion cut when negotiators could
not agree on a budget by the start of the fiscal year. In 1987, the
slashes otaled $23 billion, but they were repealed after a couple
of months. Last year, after a partial repeal, the cuts amounted to
$16.2 billion. Now we're up to $85 billion to start, with more to
come in mid-October.
   ``We're not talking about a flesh wound as we have in the past.
We're talking about traumatic injury to vital organs here,'' said
Norman Ornstein, a congressional analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute.
   He and others say the budget paralysis is reinforced by an
almost total lack of public pressure to get the job done.
   ``One of the problems is that we've seen sequesters before and
they weren't all that bad,'' said Cox. ``Something really awful may
have to happen before people realize ... how screwed up we are.''
   The budget deadline is only one of three Congress faces next
week, the first of the fiscal year. Missing any one of them is an
invitation to upheaval.
   Besides trying to avert the automatic cuts, Congress must also
raise the debt ceiling - or the country will run out of borrowing
capacity - and pass a temporary spending bill to keep the
government going while budget decisions are made.
   ``You're going to see a spectacle of disruption and acrimony,''
Cox predicted unhappily.
   But Ornstein said the ritualized last-minute hysteria, messy as
it may be, generally produces compromises that have kept the
deficit in check. The solution may be to ignore the process, he
said, because it stands up to close scrutiny about as well as
sausage-making.
   ``The agreement we get is no less substantial,'' he said, ``but
by the time it comes about we're all nauseous.''

   Pope John Paul II suggested Wednesday that
the Nazis killed millions of Jews in Poland during World War II
because they wanted to disgrace his native country.
   ``The assassins did all this on our land, perhaps to cover it in
infamy,'' the pope said in remarks to Polish pilgrims during his
weekly general audience. ``But one can't cover a country in infamy
with the death of innocent victims.''
   John Paul said Jews ``lived with us through generations, side by
side, on the same land.''
   ``This people was struck by the terrible death of millions of
sons and daughters,'' he said. ``First they were branded with a
special mark, then pushed into ghettos, into isolated
neighborhoods, then taken to gas chambers to die, only because they
were the sons of this people.
   ``The people which lived with us during many generations,
remained with us after this terrible death of its sons and
daughters. Together we await the day of judgment and
resurrection.''
   Three million Polish Jews perished in the Holocaust. At the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland, 2.5 million Jews from Poland and
other European countries were killed by the Nazis.

   A Norwegian multimillionaire made front page
news Wednesday by paying income tax.
   Complaining about high taxes and hunting for deductions are
national pastimes in this welfare state and newspapers frequently
expose tax avoidance schemes used by the rich.
   So when Knut Utstein Kloster, one of the country's richest men,
paid more taxes than he owed, it was a news sensation.
   The shipowner and investor sent a voluntary payment of $130,000
to the Oslo tax office, explaining that ``I want to do my part for
the common good.''
   Actually, he would not have had to pay any taxes, Kloster told
the Dagbladet newspaper. Complicated tax rules had left him no
income tax obligation for 1989 since he had invested in new
projects.
   ``It happened against my will,'' said Kloster, who has an
estimated personal fortune of $44 million. ``Everyone should pay
tax.''
   Tax officials told Dagbladet that the voluntary payment was
probably the largest ever made in Norway.

   The rain-swollen Jamuna River
overflowed its banks and stranded 300,000 people, trapping many on
levees or on the roofs of their mud and straw huts, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   It was the monsoon season's third flood in the Sirajganj
district, 65 miles northwest of Dhaka. Previous floods killed 70
people and displaced about 500,000.
   The Bengali-language daily Sangbad said flooding disrupted road
links and washed away paddy crops over a wide area. One village
elder was quoted as saying thousands of people needed immediate
evacuation.
   Low-lying Bangladesh suffers floods that kill hundreds of people
each year. With 110 million people, it is one of the world's
poorest countries, with an annual per capita income of $170.

   Sweden helped the United States spy on
the Soviet Union in the 1950s in violation of this country's policy
of neutrality, a former defense agency specialist said Wednesday.
   John Edin said a Swedish DC-3 plane that disappeared over Soviet
territory in 1952 was equipped with sophisticated U.S.
reconnaissance equipment the Americans had supplied in exchange for
intellegence information.
   Edin, who is retired, worked as a monitor at the Radio Institute
of the Swedish Armed Forces, FRA, from 1948 to 1956.
   ``Parts of the Swedish defense, especially the FRA ... have had
far-reaching cooperation with NATO since the alliance was formed at
the end of the 1940s,'' Edin said in an article signed by him and
published by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper. He provided no further
examples.
   Evert Dahlen, a spokesman for the armed forces chief of staff,
said such cooperation would have required government approval and
that he was unaware of any such agreement.
   ``We never comment on how our intelligence works,'' he added.
   The DC-3 and its crew were never recovered. The incident became
known as the Catalina affair after the Soviets shot down a Swedish
air force Catalina aircraft searching for the missing plane.
   The DC-3 was believed to have been shot down by the Soviets over
the Baltic Sea. But Edin said he thought the plane was forced to
land in the Soviet Union and the equipment seized.

   U.S. Marine Commandant
Gen. Alfred Gray told his men Wednesday to dig in for a long stay
in the Saudi desert and to stop asking when they would be going
home.
   He also reminded them that if they are attacked ``the best
defense is a good offense.''
   Gray delivered a 45-minute pep talk to Marines at a combat
support detachment not far from the Persian Gulf and the
north-south highways the corps is straddling to protect vital Saudi
oil installations.
   He told the men he hoped to be able to stick to the policy of
limiting major deployments to six months. But Gray, known for his
bluntness, said the tense standoff and logistical problems might
prevent normal rotations and he didn't expect any whining.
   ``I don't want to hear about any more questions about how long
you're going to be here,'' he told about 200 Marines gathered
around him at the camp, named in honor of Joe Foss, a World War II
Marine flying ace who later was governor of South Dakota and
chairman of the National Rifle Association.
   ``How long are we going to be here?'' he asked rhetorically
through a bullhorn. ``Well, we're going to be here as long as it
takes to get done what has to be done.
   ``There will be no morale problems ... because I say there will
be morale. There will also be no boredom.''
   He described the Marines' mission as defensive, but said the
U.S.-led multinational forces deployed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
were gaining more power every day and ``have everything we need to
do whatever needs to be done.''
   Gray solemnly reminded his troops that ``Marines are always in
this part of the world the No. 1 target of terrorist attacks.''
   More than 240 Marines were killed by a suicide truck bomber who
blew up their barracks in Beirut in October 1983. The Marines were
in Lebanon as part of a multinational peacekeeping force.
   Gray told the troops there were 13 ships headed to the gulf
region with supplies to sustain their deployment in the northern
Saudi desert.
   ``You and the rest of your warrior friends, you're really on the
point. You're the tip of the spear,'' he said.
   For now, Gray said the mission was defense, but he suggested the
Marines would quickly go on offense if Iraqi forces attacked.
   ``We all know the best defense is a good offense,'' he said.
``We have a very, very powerful, flexible and most useful force,
afloat and ashore, ready to do whatever needs to be done. We're
going to play for keeps if that is required.''
   He told the men not to underestimate Iraq's large army, which
fought an all-out war with the Iranians from 1980 to 1988.
   ``We face the potential of a pretty good firefight,'' Gray said.
   Gray also said he believed the swift American response to
Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait had prevented the Iraqis from
moving into Saudi Arabia.
   ``You've won a big one already and you haven't had to fire a
shot,'' he said. ``And nobody's had to get patched up.''

   A woman has pleaded no contest to
a contempt citation for dumping thousands of cockroaches in a
courtroom to protest conditions at her rented house.
   Maria Terwen, 67, entered the plea Tuesday. Morgan County
Magistrate Donald Sharp did not fine Terwen, but his assistant,
Cindy Stotler, said the county could bill Terwen for the cost of
spraying the courthouse with insecticide.
   Terwen dumped thousands of roaches on Magistrate Margaret
Gordon's desk during a hearing on a complaint filed against Terwen
by her landlord. The landlord had complained that Terwen was $5,400
behind in rent. Terwen said she had no money.
   Terwen, who has 17 dogs and cats, said there are so many roaches
in the house she must shake off her clothes before putting them on
and must skim roaches from her cats' milk bowl when she feeds them.
   Magistrate court officials halted the rent case after the
hearing, Stotler said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Mark Hatfield's Democratic opponent is
trying to revive his struggling campaign by attacking the Oregon
senator's top aide for potential conflicts of interest.
   Democrat Harry Lonsdale is making an issue of the aide's
activities as he attempts to paint Hatfield as a friend of special
interests and big business, especially the Northwest's timber
industry.
   Hatfield's integrity may have been compromised because his
administrative assistant, Gerald Frank, sat on the board of a
failed savings and loan and made more than 50 trips to New York
over four years at the Senate's expense, the Lonsdale campaign
suggested. Frank also holds stock in at least three timber
companies, Lonsdale aides said.
   Frank and Hatfield deny there has been any conflict of interest
or improper use of Senate finances.
   ``What people are forgetting is that it is not Gerry Frank on
the ballot, I'm on the ballot. Let's talk about me,'' said
Hatfield, the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations
Committee. He was first elected in 1966.
   ``At the very least it gives the appearance of a conflict of
interest,'' said Dan Walter, Lonsdale's campaign manager.
   ``It illustrates how pervasive special interest and big business
is. I don't think it is healthy for the public interest when those
interests are so intertwined. It looks like the good-old-boy
network is very much alive and well,'' Walter said.
   Frank, whose prominence in Oregon has led some to call him
``Oregon's third senator,'' has worked for Hatfield for 23 years.
   Lonsdale's agenda is to ``somehow discredit Senator Hatfield by
somehow discrediting me,'' said Frank.
   ``This was planted (with media outlets) by the Lonsdale people
and they have admitted it,'' Frank said. ``Everything has been a
matter of public record filed with the Senate in disclosure
forms.''
   Bill Calder, Hatfield's press secretary, said Lonsdale's effort
will backfire because he is ``diverting attention from the
issues.''
   Frank, 67, a millionaire whose family founded the Northwest's
largest department store chain, said he never tried to influence
Hatfield regarding any savings and loan institutions.
   Frank said he served on the board of Salem's American Federal
Savings and Loan from 1962 to 1987 because he wanted to make
inexpensive housing available in the region.
   ``It was a family operation,'' Frank said. ``When we got into
things other than providing home mortgages, investing in Arizona
and Texs, I raised questions of unhappiness with the management of
the outfit. I had my fill and quit in 1987.''
   Lonsdale said earlier this month that he was not sure that
Hatfield had been influenced in regard to S&amp;Ls, ``but his chief of
staff has been very deeply involved himself in S&amp;Ls. So I think
that it might have been very easy for Mark Hatfield to become
complacent about how the S&amp;L bailout was handled.'' He trailed
Hatfield by a 63 percent to 27 percent margin in an August poll.
   ``The man was on the board of a savings and loan while his boss
was voting on banking and S&amp;L regulation,'' said Walter.
   Frank, who lives in Oregon and makes frequent trips to
Washington, said he has never traveled for personal purposes at
Senate expense. He said he frequently flew out of Los Angeles and
New York because the cross-country flights were cheaper than
similar flights between Portland and Washington D.C.
   Frank, who publishes an annual travel guide to New York City
that has earned him more than $1 million, said he used personal
finances to cover ``every penny'' of travel related to work on the
travel guide.
   Calder said all of the Senate-paid expenses were approved by the
Senate Dispersing Office and Senate Rules Committee.
   Frank said hired investors buy and sell his stocks and he was
not aware that he had any holdings in timber companies. He said he
has never used his position to try to influence Hatfield regarding
any private interests.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of a self-help book about bladder control
had been slow. Then Ann Landers mentioned it in her column and the
book's publisher was flooded with more orders in one day than it
got the previous 10 months.
   The Hopkins Press said Monday's mail brought 18,000 orders for
``Staying Dry, A Practical Guide to Bladder Control.'' It was the
largest single-day order ever for a Hopkins book, the publisher
said.
   Landers mentioned the book last week in her daily syndicated
column. About 22,000 readers of the column have written for copies
of the book so far, the publisher said.
   ``The thing that kills me about this is that it is literally the
book that nobody wanted to hear about,'' said Bob Oeste, promotions
manager for Hopkins Press.
   The book has ``sold more copies in one day than most of our
books sell in a lifetime,'' Oeste said.
   The book, first printed in November 1989, had sold 12,000 copies
up until last week, he said. Last week, 3,000 copies of the book
sat in storage.
   On Monday, Hopkins asked a Virginia printer to rush an
additional 30,000 copies into print, he said.
   The book details treatment procedures that are effective for 90
percent of those suffering from incontinence, said Kathryn Burgio,
assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh,
one of the book's authors. Common remedies include exercise of
pelvic muscles, medication and surgery.
   An estimated 10 million people have some form of treatable
urinary incontinence, the inability to control the bladder muscles,
including one third of people over age 60, she said.

   It's three stories of concrete and junk. It
weighs 60 tons and pigeons call it home. But is it art?
   The owner of the mall in suburban Berwyn where ``Big Bil-Bored''
has stood for a decade still gets angry letters demanding that he
tear down the $25,000 sculpture.
   ``They get real mad at me. I get letters saying, `If you like it
so much, why isn't it in your yard?' '' owner David Bermant said
Tuesday.
   The project symbolizes America's throw-away society, said the
sculptor, Nancy Rubins. Small appliances and other scrap are
embedded in the concrete structure.
   Even Big Bil-Bored's defenders don't like it, but they say
Bermant has the right to display his art on his property.
   ``It's tacky. But if you consider the tastelessness of Berwyn,
(it) fits with Joe Six-pack grunting from bar to bar,'' said
resident John Moisant.
   Bermant hired the Gallup Organization earlier this month to find
out if a majority of shoppers at suburban Berwyn's Cermak Plaza
Shopping Center think ``Big Bil-Bored'' should stay or go.
   If ``Big Bil-Bored'' comes down, something even wilder will
replace it, Bermant promises.
   Few malls look anything like Cermak Plaza, located at one of the
city's busiest intersections. Bermant has installed 30 pieces
around the outdoor center, including ``Spindle,'' a stack of cars
impaled on a huge spike in the parking lot, and ``Pinto Pelt'' - in
which an artist removed the bodywork from an old Ford Pinto and
bolted it to the outside of a building.
   Bermant wants to put sculptures where they will be seen and give
his shopping centers some individuality. He has installed
sculptures at five of the 20 centers he has owned across the
country.
   ``What makes it any different from any other shopping center?
I've got the same crappy merchants selling the same crappy stuff,''
Bermant said.

   Germany will continue to do its fair share in
helping Third World countries despite the burden of unification, a
top official said Wednesday.
   Karl Otto Poehl, head of the West German Federal Bank, told
reporters covering the annual meeting of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund that ``in the years ahead we will
contribute our fair share towards assisting the developing
countries, the burden of unification notwithstanding.''
   The bank, which works independently of but in close cooperation
with the West German government, will become the top financial
authority for all Germany when east and west unite Wednesday.
   Poehl said West German aid to the Third World again increased
markedly last year.

   Gov. Norm Bangerter returned from a
three-week trade mission overseas to an office filled with $95,000
worth of new furnishings, including a custom-made rug with the
state seal and a hydraulic table.
   The Republican governor wasn't sure if he liked the new look,
the first remodeling since he took office in 1986.
   ``I can't decide yet,'' Bangerter said Monday.
   Gone are a boxy wooden desk and oversize simulated wood-grain
conference table, worn vinyl-covered chairs and sofa, soiled
textured wallpaper and wall-to-wall carpeting.
   In their places are items selected by an interior designer hired
by the state as part of a $3.5 million Capitol remodeling project.
   The state official overseeing the project acknowledges the
remodeling may not be to Bangerter's taste.
   ``This isn't a Gov. Bangerter design. This is something
befitting the State Capitol,'' said Neal Stowe, director of
facilities construction management for the state.
   ``This has got to be more of a statesman's office. It's not just
a simple office where you conduct some business,'' Stowe said.
   About that hydraulic table: It has a concealed mechanism that
allows the governor to raise it to desk height for work sessions or
lower it to coffee-table level for informal meetings.

   Authorities plan to offer a reward for
information about vandalism to the grave of teen-age AIDS victim
Ryan White.
   Hamilton County sheriff's Deputy Gene Stilts said today the
6-foot-8 monument at the Cicero Cemetery had not been damaged, but
greenery around the headstone was destroyed, and statues and a
candleholder were disassembled.
   The vandalism is believed to have occurred Sept. 14.
   Stits said he had been able to reconstruct the metal and glass
candleholder, which is at the base of the monument that bears the
words ``Kid of Courage.''
   White died April 8 at age 18 following a lengthy battle against
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   After winning a legal fight to remain in public schools near
Kokomo, his family moved to Cicero, about 20 miles north of
Indianapolis. He became an international spokesman for AIDS
victims.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The all-white Pretoria City
Council ended a 12-hour cut in electricity to two black townships
today.
   Power had been cut to the townships of Mamelodi and
Atteridgeville at 4 a.m. because residents have refused to pay
their bills for three months, the council said. Electrical service
resumed at about 4:20 p.m.
   Township leaders met with Pretoria officials today to try to
work out a solution. A joint statement issued after the meeting
said the city council was convinced an agreement could be reached
and agreed to temporarily restore power. It said the outstanding
bills must be paid.
   Residents owe about $2 million in overdue electricity bills,
according to the council, which s controlled by President F.W. de
Klerk's National Party.
   Blacks living in the Mamelodi and Atteridgeville townships have
withheld payments to protest what they say are high fees and poor
services. Some 600,000 blacks live in the townships on the edge of
Pretoria, the capital.
   The electricity cut shuts down light towers in the townships and
household appliances such as lamps, refrigerators and stoves. The
resulting darkness at night could increase street crime, although
police have bolstered patrols to try to maintain order. No
incidents were reported today.
   Brian Currin, director of the Lawyers for Human Rights, said
township residents planned legal action against the city council
for its ``provocative and politically irresponsible'' decision to
cut power.
   A civic leader later said lawyers were asked to delay any
action.
   Several whites-only city councils have cut electricity recently
to neighboring black townships after residents refused to pay their
bills to protest services. However, the electricity has been
restored within a day or two following negotiations between the two
sides.
   In other developments, police launched a homicide investigation
into the deaths of seven people whose bodies were found Monday
along railroad tracks between Johannesburg and the Soweto black
township.
   Police Col. Frans Malherbe said the deaths occurred during a
panic created by a false alarm that the train was under attack. He
said ``criminal elements'' spread the attack rumor to steal
passengers' belongings in the confusion.
   ``People who go about raising these false alarms will almost
certainly be charged with culpable homicide,'' he said.
   Attacks on trains in the Johannesburg area have killed more than
two dozen people in recent weeks.
   Police said today there were no reports of trouble during the
first night of a 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew imposed to stop violence in
black townships around Johannesburg.
   About 800 blacks have died since fighting began outside
Johannesburg in early August between the African National Congress
and Inkatha. Both organizations oppose apartheid, but differ on
tactics and plans for a future South Africa.

   Three-year-old Eric Mansfield will never
have to ask his mother how babies are born.
   He got an early lesson when he helped deliver his sister Tuesday
on the kitchen floor of his home after his mother went into sudden
labor.
   The family doesn't have a telephone, so Linda Mansfield couldn't
call for help, and no one else was home. But she and her son had
little trouble, said her husband, Jack.
   ``He was tickled pink,'' Mansfield said of Eric. ``He was a
super trouper.''
   Mrs. Mansfield, 31, and Jennifer, who weighed 8 pounds, 8
ounces, were later checked by a doctor. Mother and baby went back
home and were doing well, Dr. Gordon Maxwell said.
   The birth began shortly after Jack Mansfield had left to go
grocery shopping. Their other children, aged 9 and 13, were at
school.
   Mrs. Mansfield, who was due Oct. 2, wa drying dishes when her
water broke.
   ``This was our fourth child, and everything just dropped,'' her
husband said. ``She told Eric, `We're having a baby.' ''
   She instructed Eric to get a baby blanket and sterile scissors
and pads, which the couple had arranged as a precaution.
   Eric remembered hearing his parents discuss the Lamaze
childbirth method and offered to bring his mother a toy whistle so
she could blow on it.
   Although he found the sight of the placenta a little unnerving,
Eric watched the 30-minute event from beginning to end, his father
said.
   ``She was afraid he would cry and go hide, like little kids do,
but he brought the things she needed and stayed right there,'' he
said.
   Mansfield said his wife told Eric what was happening as he
watched the birth.
   He returned home minutes after his new daughter was born.
   ``I walked through the door and Eric hollered `Daddy, we're
having a baby,' '' Jack said.
   He found his wife lying on the kitchen floor, the baby in her
arms.
   When the two older children came home from school, ``It was
better than Christmas to them,'' Jack said.

<HEAD>Quake Felt in Six States Along New Madrid Fault; No Major Damage</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 12th graf, `There have ...' to CORRECT that scientist

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An earthquake shook parts of Illinois,
Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Indiana this morning,
but no major damage was reported.
   The quake was felt at at 8:19 a.m. CDT. It registered 4.6 on the
Richter scale and was centered along the New Madrid fault 40 miles
north of New Madrid, Mo., according to Don Kelly, a spokesman for
the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va.
   New Madrid has been the site of some of the greatest earthquakes
in U.S. history. The New Madrid fault line runs from Marked Tree,
Ark., to southern Illinois and has hundreds of small quakes every
year.
   Although there were no accounts of damage, the temblor rattled
nerves throughout the region, which has been on edge about
predictions of a major quake.
   Kenneth Rutledge, who lives 16 miles east of Hopkinsville, Ky.,
said he was sitting in his living room when the quake hit.
   ``I'm telling you it moved me,'' he said.
   Leonard Nash, who was visiting a farm in Piggott in northeastern
Arkansas, said: ``You could feel it and hear things moving in the
house. It lasted just a few seconds.
   ``It didn't excite us too much. It wasn't anything that was that
frightening. We just looked at each other, said `Hey, that was an
earthquake' and continued our talking.''
   Scott Chambers, the director of Emergency Medical Services in
Corning, Ark., said he felt the temblor at the local hospital.
   ``It was about like standing real close to a train track when a
train comes by, a little harder than that,'' he said.
   Three or four cataclysmic earthquakes struck the New Madrid
fault in the winter of 1811-12 and were felt as far away as Boston.
They have been estimated at about 8 on the Richter scale, which
didn't exist at the time.
   There have been predictions that an earthquake is likely along
the New Madrid fault before the end of the century. Recently, a
scientist in New Mexico predicted that a major quake could occur in
early December, prompting increases in insurance sales and other
preparatory measures.
   Other experts dispute his theory of a tidal trigger to
earthquakes but say a major quake in the region is bound to happen
eventually.
   ``I don't think this is a precursor to a larger event,'' Elaine
Foust of the U.S. Geological Survey in Nashville said today. ``But
we could flip a coin and decide. I'm not God, I can't predict.''
   Cecil Whaley, operations officer for the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency in Nashville, also pooh-poohed the five-second
shake.
   ``People who live on solid rock probably did not feel it,''
Whaley said. ``This appears to be normal . . . We have small ones
two or three times a week, usually imperceptible.''
   In Indiana, a dispatcher said the Evansville Police Department
had received about 60 calls from concerned citizens shortly after
the quake, but had received no reports of damage.
   Dan Moran felt the quake at the Evansville Museum of Arts and
Sciences, which is featuring an earthquake exhibit this fall.
   ``Maybe this will help grab people's attention again about the
inevitability of earthquakes,'' Moran said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as mesured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to
magnitude 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
Some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30
times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. A
quake of magnitude 5 is capable of considerable damage.
   Last October's earthquake in San Francisco registered 7.1.

   Saddam Hussein is the leading scoundrel among
the American video game set.
   The Iraqi president finished ahead of drugs and drug dealers as
nominees for dumb or outrageous behavior in a survey of 3,000
readers of VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment magazine.
   More than 1,500 kids nominated Saddam as the leading personality
for the 1990 Bonk Award. Drugs and drug dealers were cited by 1,000
respondents and alcohol and smoking each got 500 votes as things
that deserved to be ``bonked.''
   ``The process of `bonking' Saddam Hussein is therapeutic for
children. It changes fear into anger, which gives them much more
control,'' said Dr. Robert Butterworth, a child psychologist with
Contemporary Psychology Associates in Los Angeles.
   The award is named after the hero in ``Bonk's Adventure,'' a
video game on NEC's TurboGrafx-16 system. Bonk is a caveman who
literally uses his head to defeat his enemies and smash through
obstacles.
   NEC sponsored a write-in survey in the September issue of
VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment, which has a mostly teenage
readership. The contest was conceived and booked in June, long
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Kids were allowed to list one person and one thing on their
responses. Other personalities cited were Libynn leader Moammar
Qadhafi, Donald Trump, Pete Rose, Roseanne Barr, Andrew Dice Clay
and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
   Other things that kids thought should be ``bonked'' included
Exxon Corp., gangs and acne.

   President Bush, stumping today for
Republicans in the Midwest, blasted Democrats in one breath and
profusely thanked them in the next.
   The president said bipartisanship is of the utmost importance as
he seeks support for his Persian Gulf policies and the massive U.S.
military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I'm grateful to the Democratic leadership for the support they
have given,'' he told a fund-raising luncheon for gubernatorial
candidate George Voinovich. ``We need to ... continue to maintain a
bipartisan spirit in support of America's response to Iraqi
aggression,'' he said.
   He reiterated his feeling that politics should ``stop at the
water's edge'' when it comes to an international crisis.
   The words were similar to what Bush has said many times since
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But they contrasted sharply with
the blistering attack he had leveled against Democrats a moment
before when he talked about the budget negotiations.
   Acknowledging that ``emotions in this budget debate ... are
running high,'' Bush launched into a tirade against Democrats in
Congress who he accused of blocking an agreement to reduce the
deficit.
   With Monday looming as the deadline to reach a deficit reduction
agreement, Bush said that if failure to meet the deadline results
in automatic spending cuts, the Democrats will be to blame for the
havoc that ensues, including massive government furloughs and
disruptions of services.
   He insisted that it is not his demand for a capital gains
reduction tax that is holding up the process. Before leaving
Washington, Bush met with Republican congressional leaders who said
the president may be willing to compromise on his call for a cut in
the capital gains tax.
   ``Contrary to what you may have heard, the hangup is not capital
gains,'' Bush said. ``The hangup is with the Democrats on Capitol
Hill.
   ``It goes well beyond political rhetoric,'' he said. ``It is
important to get a solution,'' he said.
   On the political front, Bush gave Voinovich a resounding
endorsement as the candidate who would promote education and law
and order and environmental protection.
   As mayor of Cleveland, Voinovich had taken the city from ``the
gloomy dark days of despair'' and brought it into brighter times,
Bush said.
   Recent polls have shown Voinovich with a slight lead over the
Democratic nominee, state Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze
Jr., in the race to succeed Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste.
   The gubernatorial battle is one of several that is being hotly
contested by both parties as the reapportionment of congressional
districts looms.
   From Akron today, Bush was heading to Illinois for a dinner
honoring GOP Senate candidate Rep. Lynn Martin, who is in an uphill
battle against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   The president was spending tonight in Minneapolis, where he will
attend a breakfast Thursday to benefit the gubernatorial bid of
political newcomer Jon Grunseth. Grunseth, a St. Paul businessman,
won a six-way Independent-Republican primary this month to face
incumbent Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   Bush will return to Ohio on Thursday for a reception and lunch
to benefit Voinovich in Cleveland. Then he will head to Detroit to
stump for GOP Senate hopeful Rep. Bill Schuette, who is trying to
oust Democratic Sen. Carl Levin.
   As the November election nears, the president is committing one
to three days each week, with larger blocks of time expected at the
end, to help GOP candidates.
   He has used the trips as well to rally support for his huge
military deployment in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Orders for `Big-Ticket' Items Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Durable goods orders to U.S. manufacturers
slid 0.8 percent in August, according to a government report
Wednesday that analysts said indicated cutbacks in business
investment plans because of Middle East uncertainties.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -
``big-ticket'' items expected to last more than three years -
totaled a seasonally adjusted $127 billion after a revised 2.7
percent gain in July.
   Analysts pointed to a 11.2 percent drop, to $35.4 billion, in
non-defense capital goods orders, which often are a barometer of
business plans to expand and modernize.
   ``On the surface it seems to suggest that producers are wary
about the economic outlook,'' said Gilbert Benz, an economist with
the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. ``There's no way that ...
producer investment won't be affected by oil prices, particularly
if they stay above $35 a barrel''
   Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, oil prices have
soared from less than $15 a barrel to nearly $40 a barrel. The
price shock has further weakened an already sluggish economy that
some economists say is slipping into recession.
   In fact, economist Gordon Richards of the National Association
of Manufacturers said the durable goods report ``provides further
confirmation that the recession began in August. The start of the
recession was already in evidence due to falling retail sales and
industrial production.''
   William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in both new and unfilled
orders means the economy ``will fall into a recession in the fourth
quarter.''
   Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington was not
as pessimistic, pointing to another Commerce Department report
Wednesday that showed August consumer spending up 0.5 percent from
July, while June and July figures were even stronger than first
reported.
   ``It appeared that spending appeared to be recovering in June
and the oil shock didn't make that much of a dent in it,'' Evans
said.
   Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity. The report also said personal incomes grew 0.3
percent in August.
   Evans also noted the decline in some durable goods order
categories ``was partially offset by a big surge in defense orders,
and that was no surprise given what's going on in the Middle
East.''
   Defense orders, which often are volatile, jumped 12.4 percent to
$8.4 billion after a 5.6 percent decline in July.
   ``My guess is that almost all of that was due to the Persian
Gulf,'' Evans said. Excluding the defense category, orders fell 1.6
percent.
   Both electrical machinery and transportation categories posted
gains while non-electrical machinery and primary metals orders
fell.
   Orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3 percent, to $35.2
billion, mostly for motor vehicles. Aircraft orders fell about $3
billion. Excluding the transportation category, durable goods
orders fell 1.6 percent. Transportation orders jumped 4.5 percent
in July.
   Electrical machinery orders advanced 2.6 percent, to $20.8
billion, after a 1.5 percent gain a month earlier.
   But non-electrical machinery orders fell 6.1 percent, to $21.2
billion, after gaining 3.5 percent in July. And orders for primary
metals slipped 1.7 percent, to $11.6 billion, after rising 2.8
percent the previous month.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 2.9 percent, to $128.7 billion,
in August, most of which was motor vehicles. Shipments had fallen
1.8 percent in July.
   Unfilled orders edged down 0.3 percent, to $499.3 billion, after
gaining 0.6 percent a month earlier.

   ``The Sting of Death,'' a movie from Japan
featured in the New York Film Festival, is a spare tale of betrayal
- how a husband's infidelity permanently stains his wife's soul
with grief and jealousy.
   Director Kohei Oguri's opens his film with Miho, a homemaker and
mother of two, and her husband, Toshio, once a kamakazi pilot and
now a writer, calmly discussing the consequences of his affair.
   ``Hey! Do you really want to die?'' he asks.
   ``Keep your `heys' for someone else. Who do you think I am?''
   ``How do you want me to call you?''
   ``Have you no shame at all? Call me `dear.' ''
   This verbal chest thwacking goes back and forth until Toshio
defines what Miho is to him. ``You are my wife.''
   But Miho is so deeply disturbed by her husband's former mistress
that her rage begins to feed upon itself and begets more hatred,
until she is consumed by this obsessive self-destruction.
   The fire soon engulfs Toshio, too, and together they complete a
destructive circle. ``An iron pot is pressing my head hard. Hit
me,'' Miho pleads.
   Toshio obediently complies.
   In an attempt to redeem himself, he offers her complete
servitude and fidelity. He tells her that since he tormented her
for 10 years with his affair, he will be her slave for the next 10.
   She accepts this pact, for a while, but soon is undone by the
recurring jealousy of the other woman. She sells her kimonos, hires
a private detective and discovers the sordid secrets of her
husband's philanderings - he bought the other woman underwear, gave
her candy, paid for an abortion.
   Back and forth the couple struggles between saving their
marriage and resigning themselves to the pain and emptiness before
them.
   He becomes the picture of contrition, offering her effusive
apologies and begging for forgiveness. ``I've thought only of
myself after the war,'' he confesses.
   At times Miho seems to have exorcised the ghost of the other
woman and a semblance of domestic normalcy prevails.
   Then, seemingly from nowhere, she blurts out over dinner that
she wants her husband to forever call her by the name of his
mistress.
   One of their two children, who somehow seem oblivious to the
suffering of their parents, tells Dad he might as well do as Mom
says.
   This pyschological unraveling forms the bulk of this bleak
story, and director Oguri said at a news conference after a press
screening Tuesday that he hopes it offers a parable of finding
faith in the face of adversity.
   ``On the surface it is a crisis of a marriage,'' he said through
a translator. ``Underneath, it is a crisis of returning to
humanity, which leads you to the idea of prayer and the
accomplishment of faith.''
   ``The Sting of Death'' is marked by its austerity. The camera
rarely leaves the four walls of the home and most sets are drenched
in soft shades of gray. It's also a quiet film, ambient noise seems
to have been edited out so the only sounds we hear is the exchange
of dialogue.
   Oguri leaves his tale of the broken hearts and souls open,
without resolving if Miho and Toshio remain together or if they
part, either by death or divorce.
   Asked to speculate on their future, Oguri says he would like to
think ``they would have become happy.''
   The 28th New York Film Festival opened Sept. 21 with Joel and
Ethan Coen's quirky gangster movie, ``Miller's Crossing.'' The
17-day event features 29 films from 14 countries.

   A Trident II ballistic missile was
launched Wednesday from the submarine USS Pennsylvania as it
cruised underwater off Florida, the Air Force said.
   The successful test was the third of its kind. The exact
location of the launch was not released.
   The USS Pennsylvania is the second Trident class nuclear-powered
fleet ballistic missile submarine to carry the Trident II.
   The test is intended to demonstrate the crew's ability to safely
handle the weapons system. The submarine is certified for
deployment after each launch.
   Wednesday's launch was the 31st flight of the Trident II since
January 1987. Twenty-eight involved missiles under development, 19
of which were launched from a land pad at Cape Canaveral and nine
from the submarine USS Tennessee.

<HEAD>Sessions Defends FBI Stings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William S. Sessions on Wednesday
reaffirmed his support of the bureau's undercover tactics,
including the sting operation which videotaped Washington Mayor
Marion Barry smoking crack cocaine.
   But Sessions acknowledged that a jury's refusal to convict Barry
of the charge arising from that sting may have underscored the
``need to be very careful and look very carefully before you elect
to use a particular technique.''
   The FBI did exercise such caution before it used a former
girlfriend of Barry's to lure the mayor to a downtown hotel, where
he smoked crack in front of a hidden video camera, the director
insisted.
   Sessions also backed the FBI's use of undercover operations to
catch people in the act of other misdeeds, as in the Abscam
corruption investigation of a decade ago. That case netted
convictions of seven members of Congress.
   ``When we gather evidence, it is not always simply a matter of
walking up and asking the farmer if his eggs are fresh,'' Sessions
said. ``There are things you do that will be available to use for
evidence in the course of a trial.''
   ``For the techniques in Abscam, I would not apologize, nor do I
feel they were inappropriate,'' Sessions said. ``Nor do I feel the
techniques that were utilized in the case at hand were
inappropriate.''
   The videotapes of Barry smoking crack ``were not suppressed
under the law, they were allowed by the court, they were available
to the jury and it did what it wanted to do with it, which is the
genius of our system,'' Sessions said.
   ``If they rejected that on account of that technique, then, of
course, that is a price the government ultimately paid,'' Sessions
said of the jury's verdict.
   Jurors deadlocked on 12 counts against Barry, including a
cocaine possession charge arising from his Jan. 18 arrest at the
Vista Hotel. Barry was convicted of one misdemeanor cocaine
possession count and is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 26. He was
acquitted of another misdemeanor possession charge.
   Prosecutors decided not to retry Barry on the remaining counts,
including three perjury charges that the mayor lied to a grand jury
by denying that he had used cocaine.
   Sessions said the verdict's message about FBI undercover
investigations of elected public officials ``could take many
forms.''
   ``It could be everything from a strong affirmation to a caution
that ... you need to be careful and look carefully before you elect
to use as particular technique.''
   ``And that was done in that case,'' Sessions said.
   On other subjects, the director said:
   -His health is excellent in the wake of surgery last June for a
medical condition he refused to disclose. Sessions acknowledged
that he is periodically tested for skin cancer that was removed
from his back in 1985.
   ``I am in good health, I continue to be in good health. I am not
worried about my health and I would hope that will actually turn
out and continue to be true,'' Sessions said.
   -The FBI had no indication of Iraqi-sponsored terrorism since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last month. Sessions said the bureau is
on high alert against any possible terrorist acts and ``we are, of
course, hopeful we would be able to avert and avoid any terrorist
act itself.''

<HEAD>U.S. Marines Fly Food to City Where Doe's Lions Prey on Hungry
People</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines on Wednesday flew
emergency food and medical supplies into the capital, where pet
lions of slain President Samuel Doe reportedly were preying on
starving people inside his mansion.
   A cease-fire between four armies in Monrovia held for the fifth
day, although gunshots crackled occasionally.
   The Daily Mail newspaper of neighboring Freetown, Sierra Leone,
quoted one of Doe's generals as saying two hungry pet lions of the
ousted leader were prowling around the presidential residence in
Monrovia, eating people weakened by hunger. Many people sought
refuge in the mansion during the height of the fighting among rebel
factions and Doe's soldiers.
   The state-owned newspaper quoted Gen. Henry Chibli said the
lions normally ate 275 pounds of meat a day but that Doe had been
unable to provide them with food in his last days.
   Maj. Chris Otulana, a spokesman for a five-nation West African
army sent to enforce a truce in Liberia's 9-month-old civilwwar,
appealed for more international aid to stop people from dying of
hunger and disease.
   The Marine helicopters carried 1.3 tons of emergency food and
medical equipment from Freetown to Monrovia. The supplies belong to
the Belgian chapter of Doctors without Borders, which plans to
reopen a field hospital in the city.
   The Belgian doctors were forced to close their operations last
month when rebel leader Charles Taylor advanced into the capital
and the hospital was hit by rockets and shells.
   Otulana urged Taylor to open talks with the West African task
force ``so we can jaw jaw rather than war war.'' He spoke in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Taylor has demanded the withdrawal of the West Africans, whom he
accuses of wanting to install a puppet government in Liberia.
   He has declared himself president and is trying to install his
own government. He said he will hold elections on Oct. 10 to choose
a representative from each of Liberia's 13 counties to join the
government, which he has described as a temporary administration
that would organize general elections.
   The West African plan also proposes elections, but says they
should be organized by an interim government already chosen by
Liberian opposition parties, businessmen and clergymen.
   Taylor's aides had reported he was to meet Tuesday with Brig.
Gen. David Nimley, commander of the remnants of Doe's army, but no
meeting took place, according to the French news agency Agence
France-Presse.
   Taylor has made no contact with the West African force or those
of rival rebel leader Prince Johnson.
   Johnson and Nimley have agreed to the West African peace plan.
Johnson has said Taylor has no right to call his own elections and
that his proposal is unrealistic given the war-ravaged state of the
nation.
   Taylor started the civil war on Dec. 24 when he invadd from
neighboring Ivory Coast. Johnson fought alongside him but formed
his own rebel faction after the two quarreled. Johnson's forces
captured Doe earlier this month and tortured him to death.
   More than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the fighting. More
than half a million Liberians have fled to neighboring states and
at least another million of the 2.3 million population is displaced
within the country.
   Monrovia has been without electricity, running water and
telephone communications for three months. Few food supplies have
reached the capital.

<HEAD>Evening Express to Close, Merge With Press Herald</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 108-year-old Evening Express will
close in February, the publisher said.
   The merger with the morning Portland Press Herald will take
effect Feb. 4, said the Guy Gannett Publishing Co.
   ``While we're very proud of the Evening Express, changing
lifestyles have, for the past decade, caused an increased
readership of morning newspapers and a corresponding decrease of
evening circulation,'' said Jean Gannett Hawley, publisher of the
Portland Press Herald and the Evening Express.
   ``The merger of our two daily newspapers will result in the
creation of a single paper with more resources and standards of
quality journalism for Mainers,'' Hawley said in a statement
Tuesday.
   The Express had been losing circulation steadily since the early
1980s. Its daily circulation now stands at between 22,000 and
23,000.
   The closing will leave Maine with only two afternoon dailies -
the Journal Tribune in Biddeford and the Times Record in Brunswick,
both of which compete with the Press Herald for readers.
   The new Press Herald will continue to publish Monday through
Saturday mornings and include many of the features now contained in
the Evening Express, along with additional local news. The company
also publishes the Maine Sunday Telegram.
   The merger will leave the company with 30 fewer positions. But
the company said it might not have to lay off any employees because
it had held open vacancies this year and is providing an early
retirement incentive package.
   ``By taking this action, we believe we will be a better
newspaper for our readers who will get more features and local news
and our advertisers for whom our circulation will be
unduplicated,'' Steve Braver, the company's general manager, said
in a statement to employees.
   When founded in 1882 by Pembroke native Arthur Wood Laughlin,
the Express was one of four Portland dailies and billed itself as
``the only one-cent paper in the state.''
   Five years later, the Express was taken over by a company headed
by Col. Frederick Neal Dow, son of staunch prohibitionist Neal Dow,
whose views were reflected in the newspaper.
   Dow acquired a competing afternoon paper, the Daily Advertiser,
in 1910 and merged it with the Express, which by then had the
largest circulation in the city.
   In the 1920s, Guy P. Gannett acquired and consolidated the
city's major daily and Sunday papers, turning them into the crown
jewel of a media empire that now includes dailies in Waterville and
Augusta, a chain of weeklies in Minnesota and television and radio
stations.
   After forming the Press Herald out of the Daily Press and the
successor to the old Eastern Argus, Gannett bought the Express from
the Dow family in 1925.
   The Express' circulation peaked at about 31,000 in the late
1970s.
   The closing of the Express reflects an industry trend toward
declining circulation among many afternoon dailies across the
country that have been struggling in a time of changing lifestyles
and growing competition from television news.

<HEAD>5,000 Women Complete Course, Could Lead To More Active Role in
Society</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Question No. 5 on one exam Wednesday
for women civil defense volunteers was: ``If you inhale gas from a
chemical weapon will it cause burns in the throat?''
   More than 5,000 women completed their first two weeks of
training on a first aid and civil defense course many view as the
first step in changing the role of Saudi women forever in the
strict Moslem society.
   But training women in a profession that requires not just seeing
but touching strangers is a highly sensitive issue in a country
where women are not allowed to drive and always wear black
headscarves and long black cloaks in public.
   The changes are being made in response to Iraq's invasion Aug. 2
of neighboring Kuwait and the Saudi monarchy's call for Western
forces to help defend the kingdom.
   ``I feel now I have more of a role in society,'' said Mirvat
Mohammed, 25, a computer programmer who took the course. ``If it
(war) happens, I'm ready.''
   After the government announced in early September that women
volunteers would be accepted for civil defense training, the Health
Ministry revamped its basic 10-hour first aid course with a war
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein in mind.
   His arsenal of chemical weapons meant adding four hours of
lectures on the issue - ranging from how to seal your windows to
how to diagnose and treat chemical wounds.
   The 20-hour course also concentrated on wounds caused by guns,
said Dr. Ronda Flemban, a surgeon who taught seven groups of women
at the ministry's Health Institute in Jiddah, a Western port.
   Those trained can use the basic first aid at home but will be
called upon in time of war to act as nursing assistants.
   ``Most people don't know how to act during an emergency,'' Dr.
Flemban said. ``As we are expecting anything could happen, most
people need to know first aid.''
   Women taking the course included housewives, teachers, students
and government employees.
   Amal Fatani, 35, who graduated from George Washington University
in economics in 1985, signed up because she could not answer her
children's questions about chemical weapons.
   Daughter Tughreed, 9, and son Faris, 4, were ``very, very
afraid,'' she said.
   ``They asked me what it looked like. What would happen if we
closed the doors and windows? This course will give me the chance
to give the right answers.''
   Those that did well on the 26 questions Wednesday, such as
answering yes that inhaling chemical weapons can burn your throat,
will get the chance to sign up for a three-month, three-hour a day
intensive course.
   The government expects the response to be huge, especially
because more than 13,300 are signed up for the next two-week class
that starts Saturday. Hundreds are taking similar course at private
institutions.
   Many women said Saudi Arabia was ill-prepared for an emergency
but the threat from Iraq would change that.
   In a society where men and women are educated separately and
rarely mingle in public, the call for women volunteers was viewed
as a major social change.
   ``There will be more exposure of women within the tenets of
Islam,'' one newspaper editor said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The government would like to tap that vast resource.''
   Leila Barzangi, director of the health institute, said: ``Our
religion has always allowed and encouraged women to work as nurses
and doctors. But our traditions prevented it.''
   Tradition dictated the institute's hallways be virtually cleared
of women before the front door was opened for a visiting male
reporter.
   Greeted by a woman with only her eyes showing, he was told to
stay away from a window that looked onto the interior of the
building.
   ``It's a sensitive subject because of the religious people,''
Zahrani said.
   Women, pointing out that men and women work side-by-side in
hospitals, said this segregation would disappear instantly in event
of a crisis.
   ``During a disaster no one will even think about it,'' Dr.
Flemban said.
   Women would probably not alter their Islamic dress, but a crisis
might put a Saudi woman behind the wheel of an ambulance.

   The decision by the United Nations to
extend its trade embargo against Iraq to air traffic amounts to
``an act of war,'' the Baghdad government says.
   Thirteen of the Security Council's 15 members were represented
by foreign ministers during Tuesday's nearly unanimous vote, giving
the resolution added symbolic weight.
   The council warned the Baghdad government of further punitive
action and hinted at sanctions against nations that fail to honor
the U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq. Cuba cast the only no vote.
   Jordan, criticized for assisting Iraq by allowing some food and
supplies to cross into that country, announced today that it would
comply with the U.N. air embargo against Iraq and halt all mercy
flights of foreign nationals from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Foreign Minister Marwan Kasim said in a statement that Jordan
would comply with the air embargo, Security Council Resolution 670.
   Kasim, who also is the deputy prime minister, said, ``Jordan has
continued to allow a minimum number of flights by the Iraqi
Airways, due to humanitarian considerations, facilitating the
movement of foreign nationals from Iraq and Kuwait,'' he said.
   ``However, those flights will now be terminated in accordance
with Security Council Resolution 670,'' he said.
   In addition to sanctioning the air embargo, the resolution calls
for halting Iraqi shipping and freezing Iraqi assets overseas.
   Both Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze suggested the United Nations could
take military action if all other efforts to force Iraq into
relinquishing Kuwait fail.
   War ``is not a desirable option, but it is one of the options
contained in the U.N. Charter,'' said Shevardnadze. ``Anyway, I
hope that peaceful ways will be found to find a way out.''
   In a speech to the General Assembly earlier, he called Iraq's
seizure of Kuwait ``a major affront to mankind. . . . The United
Nations has the power to suppress acts of aggression. There is
ample evidence that this right can be exercised. It will be, if the
illegal occupation of Kuwait continues.''
   Baker struck a similar note:
   ``The Charter envisages the possibility of further individual
and collective measures to defend against aggression and flagrant
violations of international humanitarian law,'' he said.
   The number of foreign ministers attending the Security Council
vote underscored the determination of the international community
to compel Iraq to quit Kuwait, which Iraq's Saddam Hussein had his
army seize on Aug. 2.
   Shevardnadze told the General Assembly that people like Saddam -
who take hostages on a mass scale, threaten other nations with
destruction and are ``guilty of particular ruthlessness in the use
of force'' - should be tried by an international tribunal for their
``crime against humanity.''
   Since it invaded Kuwait, Iraq has refused to release several
thousand Western men and moved some of them to potential military
targets for use as human shields against possible attack.
   Shevardnadze was just one among a string of presidents, foreign
ministers and prime ministers who have demanded an immediate Iraqi
pullout in speeches to the 45th General Assembly, which began its
general debate on Monday.
   The foreign ministers of Britain, West Germany, Portugal,
Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain were due to
give speeches today.
   The new Security Council resolution calls on all states to bar
from their airspace all passenger and cargo flights to or from Iraq
and occupied Kuwait.
   Only U.N.-approved shipments of humanitarian food aid or
medicine are permitted.
   Iraq's ambassador, Abdul Al-Anbari, stalked out of the Security
Council session after vote, saying ``You know, boycotting a country
by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is an act of
aggression, an act of war.
   ``But up to now we have been practicing self-restraint because
we know that if war were to break out, it would destroy everything
in the region,'' he said.
   The resolution - the ninth passed by the Security Council in an
effort to force Iraq to quit Kuwait - prohibits use of force in the
air embargo but calls for searches and detention of aircraft.
   The council warned that it would consider ``serious action'' if
Iraq continued to flout the will of the international community,
hinting at a U.N. military operation. It said countries that try to
evade the embargo may themselves face secondary sanctions.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said it was the first time in
the 45-year history of the United Nations that so many foreign
ministers had attended a meeting to vote on a substantive issue.
   On only three previous occasions have the foreign ministers of
all five permanent members - the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France - attended a Security Council meeting.
   ``Rarely has the international community been so united and
determined that aggression should not succeed,'' Baker told the
council.
   ``Iraq has been quarantined because its brutal actions have
separated it from the community of nations. There can be no
business as usual. In fact, there can be no economic exchanges with
Iraq at all,'' he said.
   Cuba, which was on the receiving end of a U.S. blockade during
the 1962 missile crisis, has said it is against any sanctions on
Iraq.
   Earlier resolutions aimed at Iraq authorized ships to implement
a maritime embargo and to stop and search vessels that may be
violating trade sanctions. They also repudiated the annexation of
Kuwait, demanded the release of hostages and condemned Iraqi raids
on foreign missions in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Yeutter Sets Honor Program for Farm Conservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide program to recognize outstanding
farm conservationists was announced Wednesday by Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   The new ``Take Pride in America'' farm conservation program will
honor an outstanding farmer in each of nearly 3,000 soil and water
conservation districts during a three-year period.
   Yeutter made the announcement in Amana, Iowa, where he appeared
with officials of Goodyear Tire and Rubber, the National
Association of Conservation Districts, and the National Association
of State Conservation Agencies, cosponsors of the awards program.
   The Agriculture Department also will step up efforts to improve
the nation's water quality, he said.
   An objective will be to reduce the risk of agricultural chemical
pollution of ground and surface water, Yeutter said in prepared
remarks released here.
   The program was described by Yeutter as ``designed to improve
coordination among USDA's broad array of water quality programs,
and encourage voluntary adoption of agricultural practices'' to
improve and protect water supplies.
   As part of the plan, Yeutter said the department will put Soil
Conservation Service and Extension employees from all county
offices through ``an intensive training course in methods of
preserving water quality.''
   Also, he said, many USDA field guides are being ``rewritten to
help farmers keep agricultural chemicals out of the water.''
   Yeutter, as he has been doing recently, criticized Congress for
including higher price supports in farm bills passed by the House
and Senate. Conferees are trying to work out differences.
   But Yeutter has been complaining that some of the
market-oriented policies and flexibility of the 1985 law have been
abandoned or altered in ways that could hurt farmers in the long
run.
   ``Though Congress is trying to label this new legislation as
being farmer-friendly, it looks to us, and to America's farmers,
more like Nightmare on Elm Street, Part II, where the heart of
America's farm economy could once again be handed to our
competitors on a silver platter,'' he said.

   Three Iraqi passenger planes landed today in the Jordanian
capital, raising questions about Jordan's support for a new U.N.
air embargo against Iraq. Baghdad criticized Washington and Moscow
for their role in the U.N. crackdown.
   The Iraqi planes landing in Amman carried passengers, and it was
not known what their cargo holds contained. The planes all returned
to Baghdad.
   But Jordan later today announced it would abide by the U.N.
embargo and halt all mercy flights of foreign nationals from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Foreign Minister Marwan Kasim said in a statement at the United
Nations, ``Jordan has continued to allow a minimum number of
flights by the Iraqi Airways, due to humanitarian considerations,
facilitating the movement of foreign nationals from Iraq and
Kuwait.''
   ``However, those flights will now be terminated in accordance
with Security Council Resolution 670,'' said Kasim, who also is
deputy prime minister.
   In another development, a U.S. carrier-based helicopter carrying
17 sailors was forced to make an emergency landing this morning in
the Red Sea, the Navy said. The sailors were all rescued unharmed.
   The SH-3H Sea King helicopter landed about 5,000 yards from the
USS John F. Kennedy, the Navy said in a statement.
   The anti-submarine chopper was on a routine training mission,
the Navy said. Such copters are sometimes used for minesweeping
runs but the statement did not identify the training mission and
Navy officials were not immediately available for comment.
   Earlier today, Jordan said Iraqi passenger aircraft were not
included in the resolution approved Tuesday by the U.N. Security
Council. A Jordanian Cabinet minister said inspections of the Iraqi
aircraft began with the third flight today, and a senior aviation
official said the U.N. or other officials were free to check the
Iraqi cargo holds.
   The U.N. resolution does not mention passenger planes but says
that all planes traveling to and from Iraq should be checked to
make sure they are not carrying cargo prohibited by the U.N. trade
sanctions. The resolution prohibits the use of force to stop
planes, but allows for the detention of aircraft.
   The world body, in its ninth resolution against Iraq since the
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, also reaffirmed its embargo against
Iraqi shipping and the freezing of Iraqi assets overseas to try to
force Iraq to withdraw.
   The United States and Soviet Union both indicated U.N. military
action could be in store unless Iraq pulls out. War ``is not a
desirable option, but it is one of the options contained in the
U.N. Charter,'' Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told
the world body on Tuesday.
   Iraq's ambassador, Abdul Al-Anbari, called the U.N. actions ``an
act of war.'' The official Iraq News Agency today accused the
Soviet Union - a former ally - of being bribed by the United States
and gulf sheiks.
   ``We tell Shevardnadze, if you are not concerned about the
relations of friendship with the Arabs and want to be dragged into
the alliance of American hostility, then the Arabs will not be
concerned about the likes of you,'' the news agency said.
   Baghdad radio denounced the air embargo today and said it was
imposed ``on the directives of the hostile policy'' of President
Bush.
   Iraqi officials today announced more food rationing starting
this weekend because of the U.N. embargo. Trade and Finance
Minister Mohammed Mahdi Saleh said the rationing will include rice,
flour, cooking oil, sugar and tea.
   The lack of prospects for resolution of the nearly 8-week-old
crisis led to a 4.75 percent fall this morning on the Tokyo stock
exchange, which has dropped 28 percent since Iraq's invasion.
   Oil prices, which have nearly doubled following the invasion,
were trading lower on the New York futures market this morning,
with light sweet crude down 28 cents to $37.25 per barrel on
contracts for November delivery.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today there is an increasing
likelihood that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will lash out with
military force to try to break the U.N. embargo.
   ``We may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are
beginning to bite,'' Cheney told a conference of economists in
Washington.
   His comments followed Saddam's videotaped message to Americans,
broadcast Tuesday and today, that said U.S. gulf forces faced the
prospect of bigger losses than those suffered in the Vietnam War.
   The Defense Department reported Tuesday that about 430,000 Iraqi
soldiers are now in southern Iraq and Kuwait, up from 360,000 last
week.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Independence and its 70 attack jets
will soon join other warships in the gulf in a show of force, a
U.S. military source in the gulf said today. It would be the first
U.S. carrier in the gulf since 1974.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to say
when the 1,000-foot Independence would sail in from the Arabian
Sea.
   The Pentagon declined to comment.
   Officials concerned about vulnerability had been reluctant to
send a carrier into the gulf, whose entrance is the narrow Strait
of Hormuz.
   About 165,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in the Saudi desert
and aboard ships in the region. Thousands of Arab and European
troops have also been deployed as part of the U.S.-led,
multinational force.
   U.S. Marines defending Saudi oilfields were told by their
commander today to expect a long desert stay. Gen. Alfred Gray also
said the Marines should be prepared to shift to offense if Saudi
Arabia is attacked.
   Jordan joined Egypt today in saying it will abide by the
Security Council resolution calling for an embargo on the aircraft
of Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   However, three regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways flights arrived
in Amman from Baghdad today. The first carried 185 people aboard -
including 11 British women and children. The two flights that
landed later this morning and this afternoon also carried
Westerners.
   Jordanian officials said they were checking on details of the
U.N. resolution. ``According to our initial studying of the
resolution, we understand that it does not bar human traffic,''
said a Cabinet minister on condition of anonymity.
   Jordan has been criticized by Saudi Arabia and other gulf
nations for being reluctant to support international efforts
against Iraq.
   The Security Council resolution passed 14-1 on Tuesday, with
Cuba the only country voting no. In an unusual move intended to
give symbolic weight to the resolution, 13 of the 15 countries
represented on the Security Council sent their foreign ministers to
cast their countries' vote. Ordinarily, countries allow their
ambassadors at the United Nations to cast their votes.
   Only a few supplies have been flown in to Baghdad since the
invasion, according to Western officials.
   The Security Council already has authorized military enforcement
of a sea embargo. The air embargo is largely symbolic, since most
trade with Iraq is by land and has already been halted. Iraq's only
major export is oil.
   Iraq has sought a way around the embargo by seeking better
relations with Iran - its bitter foe in the 1980-88 war - and
reportedly attempted to exchange oil for food. Syrian President
Hafez Assad reportedly failed during his visit to Tehran this week
to persuade the Iranians not to ship supplies to Iraq.

   A new ``NC-17'' movie rating, barring
children under 17, will be announced soon by the Motion Picture
Association of America in response to the controversy over the X
rating, sources said Wednesday.
   The new rating will prevent children from attending films judged
by the MPAA ratings board to be harsher than an R rating, but will
carry none of the advertising and exhibition restraints that an X
rating guarantees.
   A spokeswoman for the association was not immediately available
for comment. The association said a news conference was scheduled
for Wednesday afternoon in New York City.
   Movies that have been given an X rating can be resubmitted for
the NC-17 rating, said one source familiar with the MPAA's
decision.
   The new NC rating will be copyrighted, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The X rating is not copyrighted
and is used widely by the adult movie industry. Critics charge the
X rating is synonymous with pornography.
   In recent months, the X rating has been given to a variety of
critically acclaimed films, including ``Henry &amp; June'' from
Universal Pictures and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' a Miramax
release from Oscar-nominated director Pedro Almodovar.
   Film companies say X ratings bar them from placing
advertisements in newspapers and on radio and television stations.
Many theater chains also refuse to show pictures bearing that
rating.
   The last time the ratings were changed was in 1984, when the
PG-13 rating was added between the PG and R ratings.
   One source said the MPAA hopes to call the rating simply NC, but
is unsure if that can be copyrighted.

   A federal grand jury investigating a failed
credit union returned two indictments today and concluded that
stories of sexual abuse and drug trafficking that arose after the
credit union closed were unfounded.
   Alisha Owen, who testified before a legislative committee that
she was a victim of sexual abuse, was indicted on eight counts of
perjury. A one-count indictment alleging bank fraud was returned
against Sandra Prucha, an assistant to the manager and treasurer of
Franklin Community Federal Credit Union.
   The grand jury issued a three-page report that said it found no
credible evidence that any prominent individuals in Omaha were
involved in ``any ring of organized activity to sexually exploit
minors, transport minors in interstate commerce for sexual
purposes, or to traffic in controlled substances.''
   Shortly after the Franklin failed in November 1988, allegations
of sexualabuse of children and drug abuse among widely known Omaha
residents circulated in the community.
   The grand jury is the same one that issued indictments last year
against Lawrence E. King Jr., former manager of Franklin.
   King, a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem at
the 1984 Republican National Convention, is awaiting trial in U.S.
District Court on 40 counts charging conspiracy, fraud and filing
false tax returns in connection with the November 1988 failure of
Franklin.
   King's wife, Alice, is charged with 12 counts of conspiracy and
fraud.
   The National Credit Union Administration also has filed lawsuits
against the Kings seeking to recover some of the $39 million it
says was missing from the credit union.
   The federal grand jury spent 24 months investigating the credit
union's failure.
   U.S. Attorney Ron Lahners declined to comment on the grand
jury's report.
   The federal grand jury today indicted Ms. Owen, 21, for
statements she made to the federal grand jury in June.
   In July, a Douglas County grand jury indicted Ms. Owen on eight
counts of perjury for testimony she gave to the grand jury in the
state court system.
   The Douglas County grand jury had said a story of sexual abuse
and prostitution told to a legislative committee was ``a carefully
crafted hoax.''
   The bank fraud charge against Ms. Prucha, 47, alleges that she
used expense vouchers to obtain cash and credit, then used the cash
and credit for her personal use, Lahners said. The indictment
alleges that about $29,000 was involved, he said.

<HEAD>Students Ignore Singh's Plea for Talks, Violence Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students ignored Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's offer for talks, and riots spread across northern India on
Wednesday in protest of a policy that reserves nearly half of the
government's jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   Police shot and killed seven people in three northern Indian
cities, including New Delhi, and imposed a curfew on 10 towns.
   The army was ordered into several neighborhoods in the capital
after protesters clashed with police for the second day.
   In a continuing wave of protest suicides, a student doused
himself with gasoline near New Delhi's police headquarters and
lighted a match, inflicting burns over half his body before he was
taken to hospital.
   Singh said he would rather resign than retract his new job
policy.
   ``I cannot barter away the aspirations of the deprived simply to
retain my chair,'' he said in a statement.
   Later, in a speech read on state-run television and radio, he
said: ``Nothing has caused me more profound anguish than the
decision of some young students to immolate themselves.''
   ``I am prepared to take any step consistent with the basic need
for social justice to dispel the fears and mollify the feelings of
those sections of youth who are apprehensive about their future,''
he said.
   Singh appealed to students for talks on Tuesday. But a students
group leading the protests said Wednesday it would not talk until
Singh abandoned the job quotas. They say the policy amounts to
reverse discrimination.
   Wednesday's deaths brought to 34 the number of people killed in
suicides and clashes with police since Singh announced the
affirmative action program on Aug. 7.
   The violence escalated on Tuesday after a student died of
self-immolation. About 20 more have tried to burn themselves to
death.
   The violence spread to middle-class neighborhoods of New Delhi
where residents, including women and children, joined the students
in shouting anti-government slogans.
   Police opened fire in an eastern suburb to quell a mob that
surrounded a police station and burned at least four vehicles, news
reports said. Press Trust of India said a 22-year-old youth was
killed and five other people were injured in the gunfire.
   Police shot and killed four demonstrators and wounded 25 others
in Modinagar, 55 miles west of New Delhi, United News of India
reported.
   Two people were killed in police gunfire in Jammu, 240 miles
north of the capital after mobs of upper-caste Hindus took to
streets, local government officials said.
   The protesters damaged at least 100 government vehicles, set
fire to 18 other vehicles and set ablaze a government revenue
office, a state-run department store and a bank, they said.
   Upper-caste Hindus say the job policy will ignore educational
merit and deprive qualified students of their share of the
government's 18 million jobs.
   The government says the policy will balance the centuries-old
inequities the rigid Hindu caste system has imposed on the
generally poorer and less educated low castes.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people and are
divided into four major heriditary castes that assign a person's
social standing and often the economic position. But upper-caste
students maintain that many low-caste Hindu have risen above
economic deprivation and do not need affirmative action programs.
   The opponents also call the policy a move to garner votes from
the low-castes, who form a majority of Indian voters.

   Kevin Locke said Wednesday that he's trying to
preserve an ancient Sioux tradition - the courting flute.
   The 36-year-old musician, storyteller and Plains hoop dancer, is
one of 13 folk artists receiving $5,000 awards this year from the
National Endowment for the Arts for their success in preserving the
nation's heritage.
   The artists - including a mariachi band, a Michigan
accordionist, a cowboy poet from Montana and a Hawaiian lei maker -
gathered for a congressional reception at a Senate office building.
   They were selected from 197 people nominated for the national
grant by their peers. The NEA has been making the awards since
1982.
   ``America's deep and varied traditional heritage is one of this
nation's greatest treasures,'' said NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer.
   Locke carried the flute, a long wooden recorder fashioned from
cedar with the mouthpiece made into the head of a bird, wrapped in
cloth in a long leather tube slung across his shoulder.
   Locke was raised on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in
South Dakota by an elderly uncle who spoke only Lakota and learned
the traditional courting songs from elders.
   By the 1960s, the tradition of the Plains and Woodlands Indian
courting flute had been all but lost as the last musicians with the
skill died off without passing it to a new generation.
   ``It is an important role,'' said Locke, who's working on a
doctoral degree in education at the University of South Dakota. ``I
see that they are a bridge between our ancestors and the people of
today.''
   The other artists honored were: Howard Armstrong, an
Afro-American string band musician in Detroit; Natividad Cano, a
mariachi musician from Monterey Park, Calif.; Giuseppe and Raffaela
DeFranco, southern Italian musicians and dancers from Belleville,
N.J.;
   Bun Em, a Cambodian silk weaver from Harrisburg, Pa.; Maude
Kegg, an Indian beadworker from Onamia, Minn.; Marie McDonald, the
lei maker from Waimea, Hawaii; cowboy poet Wallace McRae from
Forsyth, Mont.;
   Art Moilanen, a Finnish accordionist from Mass City, Mich.;
woodcarver Emilio Rosado from Utuado, Puerto Rico; Robert Spicer, a
Dickson, Tenn., square dancer; and Doug Wallin, a Marshall, N.C.,
ballad singer.

<HEAD>Bush, 70 Other World Leaders Attending Children's Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children are dying from abuse, neglect and
disease at a rate of 40,000 a day worldwide, the head of the U.N.
Children's Fund said Wednesday in a bid to raise awareness of the
plight of the young.
   This weekend, President Bush and about 70 other heads of state
or government will gather for a summit at U.N. Headquarters to
adopt a declaration placing children foremost among their national
priorities.
   James Grant, head of the U.N. Children's Fund, said the
declaration ``will be seen as marking a historic transformation in
the way the world deals with the children.''
   ``We have always, in all our religions and cultures, given
children a first call on the resources of the family,'' Grant said.
``But what is happening now is an extension of this concept to the
responsibilities of the nation-state to support the family.''
   The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights
of the Child last November.
   Grant said that as of Wednesday, 43 nations had signed and then
ratified the convention. Ratifying nations must guarantee the
survival of children, their protection and development.
   More than 100 countries have signed on, indicating their
intention to have their legislatures ratify the convention, Grant
said.
   The United States has done neither. Conservatives in Congress
have criticized the convention because it forbids the death penalty
for people younger than 18, and because it does not define a fetus
as a child and thus give it special protections.
   World leaders will meet Sunday to debate the needs of children,
then adopt the declaration and an accompanying action plan.
   The plan calls for a one-third reduction in infant mortality by
the end of the decade; access for all couples to family planning
information and services; prenatal care for all pregnant women;
reduction in the rate of low birth weight to below 10 percent; a 95
percent reduction in measles deaths; and immunization of 90 percent
of young children against childhood diseases.
   Grant said ``40,000 children die every day, two-thirds of them
from largely preventable causes, such as from not being vaccinated
against six killer diseases or the dehydration from diarrhea, for
which we now have a low-cost remedy.''
   The six deadly childhood diseases are diarrheal disease,
malaria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, and respiratory
infections.
   The other third of the deaths are caused by neglect, abuse, war,
poverty, starvation, and diseases for which there is no known cure,
such as AIDS.
   ``In 1988, 250,000 civilians died in southern Sudan because of
civil war, with the great majority of those being children,'' Grant
said. ``Civil conflict, the problems in the front-line states, like
Mozambique and Angola, all of these contribute.
   ``But what's clear is that two-thirds of the child deaths we
have today are from readily preventable causes.''
   Leaders expected to attend the weekend U.N. summit include Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, President Carlos Saul Menem
of Argentina, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
   The meeting will cost $3 million, all or most of which is being
paid by donations from governments, private organizations and
individuals, Grant said.

   A man who matches singles for a
living isn't amused by a bank's light-hearted ad slogan, ``We
handle more zeros than a dating service.''
   Jeffrey Ullman, president of the Encino-based Great Expectations
dating service, led a protest Tuesday outside Santa Monica Bank,
urging customers to close their accounts.
   ``Since Santa Monica Bank believes that single people are zeros,
we're asking all people, single and married, to reduce their bank
accounts to zero,'' said Ullman. He was joined by about three dozen
protesters, including executives of two other dating services.
   Officials of the eight-branch bank wouldn't comment, referring
questions to their ad agency, Team One Advertising.
   ``It's a little bit of humor that's meant to bring a smile, not
an attack by dating services,'' said Pat Robertson, vice president
of account services. ``We're just playing on zeros in terms of
monetary sums.
   ``It's just a comment on contemporary society that we've all had
a zero date.''
   Robertson added that the slogan will be replaced at the end of
the month, but not because of pressure from the dating services.
   ``We change them every month. We take a generic term on society
and have a little tongue in cheek with no attempt to be
mean-spirited,'' she said.
   Last month's ad, for instance, poked fun at the materialistic
side of society. It stated: ``Money isn't everything (Yeah
right).''

<HEAD>US, Peru Fail To Agree On Military Aid To Fight Drug Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts by the United States and Peru to agree
on terms for a military aid program to fight drug smuggling have
broken down, the State Department said Wednesday.
   As a result, Peru must forego $35.9 million in aid, which will
be earmarked instead for Bolivia and Colombia, said deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher.
   The two countries were unable to overcome their differences in
advance of the weekend deadline imposed by the United States. The
deadline coincides with the end of the U.S. fiscal year.
   Boucher said the U.S. and Peruvian governments have stated that
the drug problem is of ``vital importance to both our countries,
and we will continue to work together to solve it.''
   But the Washington Post, quoting unnamed officials, said
Peruvian negotiators had acted in bad faith. One official said the
Bush administration was going to ``seriously reexamine'' its
relations with Peru with respect to drugs,'' according to the Post.
   Boucher said the opinion expressed in the Post was not an
official view.
   The aid package was to have been used as part of overall plan to
encourage Peru to step up its efforts to curb drug smuggling. Peru
is a major source of coca leaf, from which cocaine is made.

<TEXT>
   A six-judge panel restored one of
Pakistan's four provincial assemblies Wednesday, reversing an order
by the army-backed caretaker government that ousted prime minister
Benazir Bhutto.
   The decision to reopen the Northwest Frontier Province assembly,
reported by Pakistan's official news agency, bolstered Ms. Bhutto's
attempt to win back her post.
   Hundreds of police surrounded the provincial assembly building
in Peshawar, a dusty city on the border with Afghanistan.
   The caretaker government immediately appealed the Peshawar High
Court decision, and a Bhutto supporter said the Supreme Court
justice barred the restoration until the appeal is decided.
   Bhutto supporters were angered by the quick Supreme Court move
barring the legislature from reopening.
   ``I didn't think they could do this, it would look so bad,''
said Amna Piracha, a lawyer and a former member in Ms. Bhutto's
government.
   ``The message I got today ... was that the constitution and law
are not respected by this caretaker government,'' said Iftikar
Gailani, Ms. Bhutto's former law minister and lawyer for the ousted
provincial assembly
   Gailani demanded the resignation of the caretaker government in
Northwest Frontier Province.
   ``Morally and constitutionally they do not exist. The government
should resign,'' he told a news conference in the capital of
Islamabad.
   Bhutto supporters also expected the lower court decision would
strengthen Ms. Bhutto's case against President Ishaq Khan, who used
his constitutional powers Aug. 6 to dismiss Pakistan's National
Assembly, or powerful lawmaking lower house of Parliament.
Parliament's dismissal ousted Ms. Bhutto from her job as prime
minister.
   ``The Peshawar decision is a real psychological boos,'' Piracha
said. ``It clouds all the dissolution orders.''
   A spokesman for the army-backed caretaker government, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said each dismissal order will have to
be decided individually.
   The provincial assembly, governed by Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center
Pakistan People's Party, was dismissed within hours of the National
Assembly. Governors of the Northwest Frontier Province and Ms.
Bhutto's home province of Sindh ordered the dismissial of the
provincial legislatures.
   Ishaq Khan sacked Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government on
charges of rampaging corruption, political ineptitude and nepotism.
   No reasons were reportedly given for the sacking of the
provincial governments.
   Ms. Bhutto, who was campaigning in the southern Sindh for
general elections later this year, was not immediately available
for comment.

<HEAD>Student Performance Low and Stagnant Last 20 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 20-year summary of the nation's educational
achievements released Wednesday by the Education Department shows
student performance is low and not improving.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos described the report by the
National Assessment of Educational Progress - popularly called the
Nation's Report Card - as ``a compendium of disappointment'' and as
``a guide for corrective action.''
   Cavazos stressed that the study revealed significant
discrepancies between what researchers indicate is most effective
in improving educational performance and what students report about
activities in the classroom and at home.
   The report includes data from reading, writing, mathematics,
science, U.S. history, civics and geography assessments conducted
in 1986 and 1988 and trend results by the congressionally mandated
project over the last two decades.
   Most of the data show that ``our present education performance
is low and not improving.''
   Top educators called for radical changes in the way education
takes place in America, and less talk and fewer studies from
policymakers.
   ``The report clearly shows the recent rhetoric from the bully
pulpit has had a zero effort on student achievement,'' said Gordon
Cawletti, executive director of the Association for Supervision and
Curriculum.
   Key findings of the report were:
   -Students can read at a surface level, getting the gist of
material, but do not read analytically or perform well on
challenging reading assignments.
   -Few students write well enough to accomplish the purposes of
different writing tasks, and most do not communicate effectively.
   -Students' grasp of the four basic arithmetic operations and
beginning problem solving is far from universal in elementary and
junior high school; by the time students near high-school
graduation, half cannot handle moderately challenging material.
   -Only small proportions of students appear to develop
specialized knowledge needed to address science-based problems, and
the pattern for falling behind begins in elementary school.
   -Students demonstrate an uneven understanding of the
Constitution and American government and politics; their knowledge
of the Bill of Rights is limited.
   The study, released one day before the first anniversary of the
Education Summit that resulted in the six national education goals,
also showed that the performance gap between white and minority
students has remained large, even though there is some improvement
by black and Hispanic students.

   The $20,000-plus pricetag at top-flight colleges may be daunting
to some, but consider the parents trying to scrape together tuition
for some of the nation's pricier private kindergartens.
   The Dalton School in New York City charges each of its 80
kindergartners $10,380 this fall, compared with $9,600 last year.
   At Beverly Hills Montessori School, in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
there are 10 children in kindergarten, each paying $405 a month.
Last year's rate was about $380.
   Tuition at the Latin School of Chicago for the 63 youngsters
attending half-day kindergarten is $5,750. Tuition last year was
$4,615.
   In Dallas, White Rock North School costs $265 a month this year,
up from $250 last year. Enrollment is at 80, same as a year ago.
   Hillcrest Private School, also in Dallas, charges $365 a month
this year, up from $350. It enrolls eight youngsters.
   The Brearley School in New York costs each of its 45
kindergarten girls $8,300, up from $7,900 last year.
   Cape Cod Academy in Osterville, Mass., charges
kindergarten-through-6th-graders $7,050, up from $6,750 a year
earlier.
   Of course, some 3.1 million other children around the country
attend public kindergarten for free - not counting taxes.

   At least two Bahraini families have won
court approval to change the names of sons named after Iraq's
Saddam Hussein, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The daily Akhbar Al-Khaleej said one child was renamed Ibrahim
and another Khalaf at the request of the parents.
   Some children were named Saddam when he was widely regarded as
an Arab hero in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. However, after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, many Persian Gulf Arabs felt the name
Saddam ``has become a synonym of disgust and anger,'' the paper
said.
   ``So a number of citizens have sought legal measures to change
names of children named after the despot,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   For one week the plight of Earl Hutchins, an
inner city family's partiarch who disappeared while suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, unified residents of a crime-torn
neighborhood.
   And though the community's search ended tragically - Hutchins'
body was found Tuesday in a harbor - neighbors hope their effort
may have a lasting effect by forging a new unity in Milwaukee's
inner city.
   ``It was a very large search,'' Moses Jordan said. ``It got
together very quickly. That was the first time something happened -
that I remember - like this.''
   The 79-year-old Hutchins, robbed of his memory by the disease,
disappeared from his north side home Sept. 19. His family
immediately began distributing fliers and organizing search
parties.
   By Friday, more than 100 volunteers had been enlisted in the
search, which spread to suburban areas. Several members of Alderman
Michael McGee's Black Panther Militia, a group formed this year to
force change through the threat of violence, led the effort.
   ``The Hutchins are an old family in Milwaukee,'' said Jerrel
Jones, a black community leader and spokesman for McGee. ``They
have millions of relatives. It was like a family member of the
community being lost.''
   McGee has promised to use his group beginning in 1995 to stage
violent, terrorist attacks if conditions for blacks - most of whom
live in impoverished neighborhoods on Milwaukee's north side -
don't improve.
   While much of the attention on the inner city this year has
focused on a drastic increase in violent crime - Milwaukee set a
new homicide record Tuesday with 116 killings - the search for
Hutchins demonstrated a more important trend, Jones said.
   ``There's a growing unity in the community,'' Jones said. ``That
(search) enhanced it because it was an issue everybody could agree
on.''
   Police were also impressed by the community effort.
   ``We were really pushing to find this man because of his illness
and his age,'' Inspector Ronald Mehl said. ``We didn't want him
wandering the streets because, as you know, we do have some
problems on our streets.
   ``We definitely appreciate all the help. ... It's the first time
I can remember when that many people were involved.''
   The search ended Tuesday when Hutchins' body was found in the
Milwaukee harbor, miles away from his home. An autopsy was being
conducted Wednesday and police refused to speculate whether foul
play was involved.
   ``I wanted a different ending,'' said one of Hutchins' five
daughters, 49-year-old Maxine Jeter. ``We were planning a big
reception - planning to invite all these people who helped - when
daddy came home.''
   Posters had been distributed throughout the city, radio and
television statons broadcast information about the search and a
Milwaukee office supply store had donated 20,000 fliers.
   Hundreds of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods looking for any
trace of the man.
   And although the search ended, mystery remains as to why
Hutchins left home. Was he a victim of crime or confused?
   ``That's what got me,'' said Jordan, 70, a longtime friend of
Hutchins. ``He had a lovely family. Two boys and five girls. He was
well thought of. He will be missed, too.''
   While police unravel the mystery, Hutchins' family can at least
relish the outpouring of friendship from their community.
   ``We're so proud of the media and all the cooperation we've
received,'' said Shirley Warren, 51, another daughter. ``We're
proud to be Milwaukeeans.''

<HEAD>De Klerk Returns Home to Criticism on Both Sides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk flew
home Wednesday with support from President Bush for his efforts to
end apartheid, but South African politicians criticized his U.S.
trip.
   De Klerk was to arrive Wednesday night to a festive welcome at
Jan Smuts International Airport.
   During de Klerk's three-day trip to Washington, President Bush
praised him for what he called South Africa's ``irreversible''
progress toward creating a non-racial democracy.
   Bush, however, said South Africa still must free all political
prisoners and eliminate the apartheid system of racial segregation
and white dominance before economic sanctions could be lifted.
   South African political leaders from opposing sides criticized
aspects of de Klerk's trip.
   African National Congress spokesman Thebo Mbeki said U.S.
officials were wrong in calling progress toward ending apartheid
irreversible. He said sanctions should be continued.
   ``Sanctions have been an important element in bringing us to
where we are now,'' Mbeki said in a speech at the University of
Pretoria. ``I won't contest that de Klerk is irreversibly committed
to change. This does not mean the process itself is irreversible.''
   Andries Treurnicht, head of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party, said de Klerk humiliated South African whites by bowing to
U.S. pressure to change. He said Bush's conditions for ending
sanctions were uncalled for.
   ``In other words, further humiliation and concessions are
demanded before the great America would be satisfied,'' Treurnicht
said. ``This is not the way to treat a sovereign state such as
South Africa.''
   The Conservative Party advocates continued white dominance and
rejects de Klerk's moves toward negotiating power sharing with the
black majority.
   The white-led government and the ANC began peace talks in May
aimed at full-blown negotiations on a new constitution.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, told a
business group Wednesday night that South Africa needed a growing
economy to smooth the transition of political change.
   Her comments were conciliatory compared with recent statements
to black groups in which she said armed struggle remained a
possibility if negotiations failed.
   Vicious street fighting between black factions in townships
around Johannesburg has strained relations between the government
and the ANC, the nations' largest black opposition movement.
   About 800 blacks have been killed since Aug. 12 in warfare
pitting Xhosas and other ANC supporters against Zulus linked to the
conservative Inkatha movement.
   The violence has eased recently following periods in which
dozens of blacks died daily.
   Police imposed a 9 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew Tuesday night in some
of the most turbulent townships. Black leaders criticized the
curfew as a violation of rights, and some groups called for
supporters to defy it. No incidents were reported.
   Residents who provide written proof of nighttime employment or
ticket stubs to concerts, movies and soccer games are exempt.
Police said journalists covering the curfew also must provide
written proof of employment.
   In other developments, police began an investigation into the
deaths of seven people whose bodies were found Monday along
railroad tracks between Johannesburg and Soweto township.
   Police Col. Frans Malherbe said the deaths occurred during a
panic created by a false alarm that the train was under attack. He
said ``criminal elements'' spread the attack rumor in order to
steal passengers' belongings in the confusion.
   Attacks on trains in the Johannesburg area have killed more than
two dozen people in recent weeks.

   Sandinista workers on Wednesday
refused to surrender four of the 16 businesses the conservative
government had returned to pre-revolutionary owners.
   Workers at the El Caracol food processing plant said they
refused to let Magelda Campos inside when she showed up with a
government order granting her ownership.
   ``She left this enterprise in shreds, never giving a thought to
the workers, and we have struggled to make it productive again,''
said Ronaldo Rodriguez, local secretary general of the Sandinista
National Workers Front.
   He said workers want the government to give El Caracol to them.
The plant has 130 employees.
   The Sandinistas confiscated hundreds of private businesses
including restaurants, car dealerships and factories during more
than a decade of revolutionary rule that ended with their defeat in
the Feb. 25 elections.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's government inherited
about 400 state enterprises when it took office on April 25, and
she promised to privatize the economy.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who flew to New York on Wednesday to address the
United Nations during the General Assembly's annual session, said
Sandinista unrest would not stop her from returning Nicaragua to a
free enterprise economy.
   In a televised speech Tuesday night, she accused the Sandinistas
of staging ``a new sabotage attempt'' against her government.
   ``I will not allow it,'' she said.
   After their electoral defeat, the Sandinistas vowed to ``govern
from below'' and block any attempts by the Chamorro government to
dismantle their leftist state. Sandinista workers paralyzed Managua
in May and again in July with strikes.
   Spokesmen for workers at the Camas Lunas bed factory and the
Sovipe small appliance plant in Managua and the Prego soap plant in
Grenada, 30 miles away, also said they would not hand over their
factories.
   ``The return of this enterprise was done only on paper; we are
not going to return anything,'' said Brenda Escoto, the local union
leader at Camas Lunas, which has 80 workers.
   A Sovipe worker told the conservative Radio Corp. station that
not all her co-workers were opposed to privatization.
   ``But Sandinistas wielding sticks chased out other workers who
opposed the takeover of the enterprise,'' said the woman, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, about 1,000 people marched to the government complex
to protest rumored layoffs of 9,000 educators nationwide. The
government has denied the rumors.
   The demonstration was peaceful apart from a few attempts to
break through the police cordon at the government complex, where
more than 2,000 officers were on hand.
   Education Minister Sofonias Cisneros had denied the layoff
rumors Monday and blamed ``extremists'' - a reference to the
Sandinistas - for circulating them. He said more than 600 new
teachers had been hired since Mrs. Chamorro took office.

<HEAD>Quest to Solve Mystery of Missing Fliers Plagued by Doubters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former air traffic controller is positive he has
unraveled the secret of Flight 19, five Navy torpedo bombers that
vanished in 1945 and fed the Bermuda Triangle legend, but getting
proof is going to be expensive.
   Jon Myhre's solution was videotaped for a segment on NBC-TV's
``Unsolved Mysteries'' on Wednesday.
   But doubters include the Navy, Smithsonian Institution, six
publishers who rejected his book manuscript and People magazine,
which held Myhre's story after buying exclusive rights to his
account.
   ``I've given it my best shot. I've done everything I can do,''
said Myhre, of Lantana, who has spent his life savings of more than
$100,000 to plot and pursue Flight 19's five Grumman TBM Avenger
torpedo bombers. ``I know I'm right. I'm just not in a position to
prove it.''
   Myhre has videotape, shot from a mini-submarine in July, of an
upside-down Avenger sitting in 390 feet of water about 35 miles off
Cape Canaveral, but he doesn't have its serial number.
   The plane, just 2{ miles from where Myhre predicted Flight 19
went down, was originally spotted during the search for debris from
the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, but it was ignored
then.
   Flight 19's disappearance became part of the legend of the
Bermuda Triangle, an area where ships and planes supposedly
disappear under mysterious circumstances involving UFOs, magnetic
fields and other such phenomena. Flight 19 even figured in ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,'' in which first the planes and then
the men were returned by aliens.
   Myhre's answer to the puzzle came with a flash eight years ago
when he read the final radio transmissions from the warplanes,
which took off from Fort Lauderdale for a training flight over
parts of the Bahamas on Dec. 5, 1945.
   The squadron leader's reported that both of his compasses were
out of order.
   At one point, the squadron leader plotted a northeasterly course
based on the assumption he had somehow reached the Florida Keys, on
the opposite side of Florida. Myhre thinks that was part of the
Bahamas' Abacos chain.
   At another point he reported he was over an island and no other
land was visible.
   Myhre, who has flown the region for years, believes that was
isolated Walker's Cay.
   By re-plotting the flight from Walker's Cay, using the Navy
transcriptions of the flight's radio reports, Myhre came up ith a
location where he thought Flight 19, its planes out of fuel, may
have ended.
   The spot was east of Cape Canaveral. The Avenger he filmed was
found 2{ miles away.
   Myhre learned of the plane spotted during the Challenger search
from news reports. This summer, with $25,000 raised by two
partners, he hired a small research submarine and located the
wreckage.
   He was unable to locate a complete aircraft serial number on the
upside down wreck.
   Footage of the Avenger shows the last three digits - 209 - of a
five-digit Navy service number on the left wingtip. Flight 19's
lead airplane number was 73209, and Navy records show only two
other Grumman TBM Avengers with service numbers ending in 209, and
neither was lost at sea.
   ``The only thing we didn't get was a positive ID on the plane's
serial number,'' Myhre said, but raising the Avenger could cost
$250,000.
   The plane's landing gear is extended, leading some to suggest
that plane was lost while trying to land on an aircraft carrier
instead of the squadron's suspected ditch.
   But Myhre insists he has the right plane and knows where the
others are.
   ``The other planes are further north in much deeper water, I'm
certain,'' he said. ``This was just the first to ditch. And the
tragic thing about it is he was only about seven minutes from land.
If they'd just kept going west ...''

<HEAD>NASA Identifies 83 Potential Leaks on Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA investigative team has
identified 83 potential sources of Columbia's dangerous hydrogen
leaks, and exhaustive testing is expected to pinpoint the problem,
the space agency said Wednesday.
   The list of suspect parts was narrowed to 83 during an analysis
of Columbia's engine compartment, said William Lenoir, head of
NASA's space flight program.
   Hydrogen flooded the section during fueling last week, thwarting
NASA's fourth attempt to send the shuttle on an astronomy mission.
   ``Any combination might actually be the culprit,'' Lenoir said.
   Workers will remove insulation from each suspected part and then
flush helium through the system, Lenoir said. If no leaks are
found, the process will be repeated with a different crew and
equipment ``to try to be absolutely sure we haven't missed
anything,'' he said.
   If helium does escape, the test will be repeated in an attempt
to ``really understand what that's telling me at that joint so I
can maybe make some correlations for the future,'' Lenoir said.
   So far, Columbia's leaks have appeared only when the shuttle's
external tank is filled with highly flammable liquid hydrogen at
super-cold temperatures, which might cause shrinkage of a metal
part and form the leak. The non-flammable helium normally used in
testing is room temperature.
   ``We know from our previous experience that our helium test has
not found some of these leaks we thought it should have, and we
want to know why,'' Lenoir said.
   The external tank will be filled with liquid hydrogen for a
special fueling test around mid-October, after Discovery's upcoming
flight. Discovery is scheduled to lift off Oct. 6 with a satellite
that will study the sun's polar regions.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
perform a second tanking test on Columbia in November to see if all
of the leaks have been plugged. About a dozen TV cameras will be
placed inside the engine compartment for both tests.
   ``I'm hopeful we will have gone through this entire sequence and
have Columbia back in a flying sequence'' in December, Lenoir said.
``We have specifically not laid that onto our engineering team.
They're not driven by schedule. They are to go out and find the
leak, find all of the leaks, and then we can get on with it.''
   NASA plans no tanking test for Discovery, the only shuttle in
which hydrogen leaks have not been found. Such a check would take
five days.
   A tanking test will be performed on Atlantis before its early
November flight. Hydrogen leaks were detected in fuel lines between
the orbiter and its external tank during a similar test in late
June.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half the Soviet troops
stationed in Czechoslovakia since the Red Army crushed the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reform movement have returned home, a military
official said Wednesday.
   Gen. Svetozar Nadovic, a Czechoslovak coordinator of the troop
withdrawal, said at least 40,500 soldiers and officers from an
estimated force of 73,500 have left, taking with them 800 tanks, 62
aircraft and 57,882 tons of ammunition.
   By the end of the year, only one Soviet motorized regiment
should be left in the nation, he said.
   ``That means that Czechoslovakia will have full sovereignty by
the end of the year - that's encouraging,'' said Svetozar.
   He said the pullout is ahead of the schedule outlined in a
February agreement between Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. That pact foresees a complete
Soviet pullout by July 1991.
   After the Soviets put down Alexander Dubcek's attempts to create
``Socialism with a human face'' in 1968, Moscow kept about 1,220
tanks, 2,505 armored vehicles, 77 combat planes and 146 helicopters
in Czechoslovakia.
   Since revolutions ousted Communist governments across Eastern
Europe last year, Soviet troops began leaving other Warsaw Pact
nations such as Hungary and East Germany, which Monday formally
announced its withdrawal from the alliance.

<TEXT>
   A thousand people turned out for a benefit by
rap music stars for soul singer Curtis Mayfield, who was seriously
injured in a stage accident last month.
   Rappers such as Tone Loc and Ice-T joined in the benefit at the
Palace nightclub in Hollywood on Tuesday night. The event raised
$25,000 for Mayfield, who is paralyzed from the neck down, Capitol
Records said Wednesday.
   Mayfield was about to appear in concert on Aug. 13 in New York
City when a gust blew a light scaffold down on him.
   Tone Loc and Ice-T said they were greatly influenced by
Mayfield's 1972 ``Superfly'' soundtrack and expressed hope that he
would ``stay strong.''
   The concert also starred rappers Eazy E, Mellow Man Ace, the
Uzi$Bros, C.P.O., and King Tee. Most of the artists had joined
Mayfield on a new soundtrack album, ``The Return of Superfly,''
released Aug. 21.
   Tone Loc said every rapper can identify a little with what
happened to Mayfield because ``all of us have been on many stages,
and this could happen to us.''

   The Census Bureau says 31.5 million Americans,
or 12.8 percent of the population, lived in poverty last year. That
was virtually no improvement over 1988, even as median household
income was up slightly because of an unexplained bulge in the
income of black households.
   The poverty rate had previously declined since 1983, when it
reached a high of 15.2 percent. In 1988 it was 13 percent, and the
bureau said the slight dip to 12.8 percent in 1989 was not
statistically significant.
   Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of the Housing and Household Economic
Statistics Division of the bureau, declined to speculate on what
the figures for 1990 will show when they become available next
year.
   The report, he said, ``does not tell us anything about the
current situation.''
   However, Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center of
Budget and Policy Priorities, a private research group, predicted
the poverty rate will go up with the apparent end of the economic
recovery of the 1980's.
   ``Our guess is that 1989 is the end of the trend,'' Greenstein
said. ``The likelihood is overwhelming that when the 1990 figures
come out, poverty will have started back up.''
   ``What struck us were two principal things: no significant
progress in reducing poverty and that the gaps between both rich
and poor and the wealthy and the middle class hit the widest plane
in more than 40 years,'' Greenstein said.
   ``The share of the national income going to the three-fifths of
the families in the middle of the income spectrum was lower in '89
than in any year since Census began collecting those data in '47,''
he said. ``The share going to the poorest fifth was tied for the
lowest of any year since '54, while the shares going to the
wealthiest fifth and the richest 5 per cent were higher than at any
point since 1947.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, commented,``At 12.8 percent, the poverty rate is still
very high, especially this far high, especially this far into an
economic expansion. And the gap between the rich and the poor is
widening, when it should be shrinking.''
   Census Bureau standards provide that a family of four making
less than $12,675 a year is classified as poor.
   The standards have come under criticism from both liberals and
conservatives.
   A study released last year by the Joint Economic Committee
indicated the poverty threshold might be raised as much as 50
percent if it were adjusted for changes in family needs and
spending patterns such as the increase in the share of income taken
up by housing costs.
   Robert Rector, welfare and poverty policy analyst at the
conservative Heritage Foundation, said the report ``dramatically
overstates the extent of true poverty'' because it does not count
non-cash government benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid as
income.
   In an article published Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal,
Rector said, ``Evidence is mounting ... that the Census Bureau's
poverty report dramatically understates the living standards of
low-income Americans.''
   In addition to the official poverty rae figure, the bureau
released calculations based on other experimental methods that
showed different results, some higher and some lower.
   The official definition of poverty was developed by the Social
Security Administration in 1964 based on Department of Agriculture
research on what people spend on food.
   It counts income in money only. By using an experimental formula
that counts Medicare, Medicaid, school lunches, food stamps and
other benefits, the Census Bureau arrived at a rate of 10.4
percent.
   Weinberg said substitution of the experimental standards would
not change the trend in poverty rates.
   Greenstein also said, ``Our sense is that the trend is pretty
clear, no matter how you measure it.''
   The report said Americans' median household income rose 1.3 per
cent in 1989, to $28,910, after adjusting for the rise in consumer
prices. The increase followed two years in which median income had
been unchanged.
   Black household income was up 5 percent to $18,080, but median
incomes in white and Hispanic households did not significantly
change. Nor did the median income of black families or that of
black men.
   Weinberg said the bulge for black households, which resulted in
the overall increase in median household income, appeared to be the
result of gains in income for black professional women living alone
or with a roommate. He had no explanation for this, and said it
could be the result of an anomaly in the sampling.
   The report was based on a survey of 58,000 U.S. households in
March.
   It showed that per capita income in 1989 was $14,060, an
all-time high. The figure was up 1 percent from 1988, which was
also a record.
   Median household incomes increased in the Northeast and West,
but remained unchanged in the South and Midwest. The report did not
include state-by-state figures.
   The median earnings of all women working year around, full-time,
increased 1.8 percent to $18,780, while the earnings of men
decreased by the same percentage to $27,430. Weinberg said he did
not know the reason for this. It brought the ratio of
female-to-male median earnings to 68 percent, a record, and up from
66 percent a year earlier.

<HEAD>Nurse Tells How She Contracted HIV Virus From Patient</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the first nurses in the nation to
contract the AIDS virus from a patient revealed her identity
Wednesday, saying she wants to remind all health care workers how
important it is to take precautions.
   ``If this can happen to me, in a small rural hospital in the
Midwest in the middle of the night in 1986, it can certainly happen
to anybody in 1990,'' Barb Fassbinder told reporters.
   Also Wednesday, a weekly newspaper in Monona, a small town in
northeastern Iowa, published a letter from the former nurse
explaining how she contracted the human immunodeficiency virus.
   ``We want to emphasize that I do not have the full-blown disease
of AIDS but do have a few relatively minor health problems as a
result of the infection of the HIV virus,'' she said in her letter
to the Monona Billboard.
   Ms. Fassbinder, 36, stopped working at the hospital in February
1989 because of health problems and now gets worker's compensation
benefits to pay for medical care. The hospital also made a
settlement agreement that remains confidential, the family's lawyer
said.
   The mother of three told reporters she believes she contracted
the virus in August 1986 during an unsuccessful attempt to
resuscitate a patient at Memorial Hospital in Prairie du Chien,
Wis.
   She said a doctor told her to remove an intravenous tube from
the patient's arm that wasn't functioning properly. She said she
applied pressure for 10 minutes with her left index finger shielded
only by a small piece of gauze - all that was in reach.
   She said the patient's blood apparently mingled with her own
through some small cuts she got while gardening.
   It wasn't until December 1986, when she made a routine blood
donation, that the virus was detected. Ms. Fassbinder wasn't
notified of the results until January 1987.
   The case was one of the first three documented instances in the
United States of such infection of a health care worker. The
national Centers for Disease Control cited it as an example of why
health workers must take precautions against being infected.
   Ms. Fassbinder said the burden of living with the secret had
become too much and that she hoped some good could be accomplished
by talking openly about AIDS and HIV infection.
   ``We also need to emphasize that the HIV virus is very fragile
outside the human body and can only be transmitted in a few very
specific ways, none of which includes social or casual contact or
even living in the same household,'' she said.
   She added that her husband, Dave, 43, and her children, Eva, 13;
Joel, 10; and Emily, 7, are infection-free.
   She said she was gratified by the support of friends and
neighbors who allow their children to continue to play at her
house.
   But things aren't entirely the same, said her husband, who is a
commercial honey producer.
   ``I really long for normalcy again,'' he said. ``I wish we were
back when Barb was working nights, and I'm complaining that she's
working too much.''
   Ms. Fassbinder, who tires easily and suffers from chronic throat
infections, declined to discuss her future.
   ``I don't like to talk prognosis,'' she said. ``It serves no
purpose. I feel good today and I'm happy.''

<HEAD>Panel Says Restaurants As Well As Supermarkets Should Disclose
Nutrition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposals to require food manufacturers to
disclose the nutrition content of their products should be extended
to restaurants, a committee of experts recommended Wednesday.
   The Institute of Medicine panel also said nutrition labeling
also should be required for fresh and frozen meat and poultry.
   Food-labeling proposals on Capitol Hill and by the Food and Drug
Administration already include many of the provisions the panel
recommended for packaged food, seafood and produce.
   But neither the pending legislation nor the draft regulations
addresses meat, poultry or restaurants.
   The institute is an affiliate of the National Academy of
Sciences, the congressionally chartered private body established to
provide scientific advice to government agencies.
   The National Restaurant Association quickly registered its
opposition to the committee's recommendations, saying most
fast-food and full-service restaurants already provide nutrition
information voluntarily.
   ``As restaurant operators we firmly believe our customers have a
right to know what nutrients are in the foods they eat,'' said
association President Mike Hurst. ``Our concern is not with
providing such information. Rather, it is with how the information
is conveyed.''
   Officials at the Department of Agriculture, which regulates meat
and poultry, had said they were waiting for the report before
making any labeling proposals.
   Jim Greene, a spokesman for the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said officials had not yet read the report but
``we plan to evaluate the specifics and plan what course to take in
the near future.''
   At the Food and Drug Administration, spokesman Jeff Nesbit said
the agency planned to consider nutrition-content disclosure for
restaurants some time in the future, but ``grocery stores are our
higher priority.''
   The FDA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services,
last July proposed regulations that would require nutrition
labeling for nearly all packaged foods and fresh produce and
seafood.
   Under its proposal, labels would have to show the number of
calories from fat, the amount of saturated fatty acids, cholesterol
and total dietary fiber. Listing of some vitamins would become
optional and serving sizes would be standardized.
   Currently, about 60 percent of supermarket foods have nutrition
information of the label, much of that done voluntarily. Labeling
is not required except when a manufacturer makes a nutrition claim
or adds nutrients.
   The institute's committee noted that Americans spend about 43
percent of their food money on meals eaten outside the home. This
is expected to amount to about $156 billion this year.
   The experts applauded the efforts of some restaurants and
fast-food chains that have begun providing nutrition information
voluntarily, but they said these efforts should be required by law.
   ``All restaurants serving standardized menu items should be
required to provide easy consumer access to nutrition profiles of
standard menu items, either by posting the information or printing
it on containers,'' said Richard A. Merrill, committee chairman and
a law professor at the University of Virginia.
   Other restaurants should have nutrition information for items on
their menus available for consumers on request, he said.
   Hurst said a National Restaurant Association survey last year
showed that three-quarters of the 39,000 restaurants polled offer
nutritional information to patrons who request it.
   The institute's recommendation would be impractical and
ineffective, Hurst said.
   Printing nutritional information on containers would be
expensive and burdensome for fast-food restaurants because many of
their containers are multi-purpose, he said.
   Requiring full-service restaurants to have nutritional
information on hand would also be costly and time-consuming,
especially for establishments that change menus daily, he said.

   ``Never say never,'' President Bush tells
thousands of public and private school teachers joining by
satellite Wednesday night in a special project to spur creative
thinking among educators and students.
   Bush's message was videotaped to launch what was described as
the nation's first live, simultaneous broadcast to a giant
satellite link of educators in more than 2,200 locations.
   The two-hour ``Great Invent America! Think Link,'' was produced
through an alliance between business and education. Workshops and a
businessman roundtable discussion were used to inspire teachers -
mostly of kindergarten through eighth grade - to teach inventive
thinking in their classrooms.
   ``It takes a special kind of independence to invent something
new, a Yankee spirit that made this nation great,'' said Bush in
the one-minute message. ``That same never-say-never spirit brings
us together tonight.
   ```As Abraham Lincoln once said, `A child is a person who is
going to carry on what you have started. He will assume control of
your cities, states and nations.' The fate of humanity is in a
child's hands. Through your efforts, our nation's children will be
given the opportunity, the inspiration, and the challenge to create
a better future for all Americans,'' the president said.
   The satellite feed was from K-Mart Corp.'s headquarters in Troy,
Mich.
   Invent America! is a national education program and student
invention competition designed to stimulate creativity and develop
problem-solving skills in the nation's 31 million school children.
   Bush launched the program in 1987, and now serves as honorary
chairman.
   ``Young people today need to understand the importance of
innovation in all aspects of life,'' said Polaroid Corp. President
I. MacAllister Booth. ``Encouraging student inquisitiveness in the
classroom is the key. Society cannot do enough to help our teachers
meet that challenge.''
   Karen Willoughby with the Fairfax County, Va., schools said she
has found that Invent America! teaches students to be critical and
innovative thinkers. The program also raises students' self-esteem,
encourages library and research skills, motivates children to learn
and experiment with scientific methods and helps teachers to
integrate curriculum, she said.
   ``It's encouraged that teaching thinking skills should happen
across the curriculum and throughout the year and not at just one
time,'' said Willoughby. ``Invent America! is just a wonderful
program to get kids to think. That's the basic thing.''
   Program Chairman J. Morgan Greene said Invent America!
orchestrated the national training session in response to the fears
of many educators and business leaders that students will not be
equipped to compete in the future because they are not being taught
creative, problem-solving skills.
   ``This one single event (places) in the hands of educators the
training and materials they need to make an immediate and positive
impact on millions of Americans students,'' said Greene.
   For the seminar, Polaroid Corp. provided $2 million in cameras,
film and curriculum materials to the participating teachers. LEGO
Dacta also provided free classroom resource materials.

   The executive producer of the television
show ``Coach'' apologized for insulting Buffalo during a promo that
ran on national television at halftime of Monday night's football
game.
   In the promo, actor Jerry Van Dyke, who plays an assistant coach
in the ABC-TV series, said the Buffalo Bills would lose no matter
what the final score of their game against the New York Jets was.
   ``Even if you (Buffalo) win, you lose,'' Van Dyke said. ``You
still have to go home to Buffalo.''
   The line prompted dozens of outraged telephone calls to WKBW-TV,
ABC's Buffalo affliate, and the station's newscasters denounced
the remark on the air the next day.
   Barry Kemp, the series' chief writer and executive producer,
said the line was ``a thoughtless slip.''
   ``I apologize to the people of Buffalo. It was uncalled for,''
Kemp told The Buffalo News. ``I will figure out some way of making
it up to Buffalo. We'll put something positive on the show to make
it up.''

   Mung beans, yogurt and prayer have
become an unlikely factor in Colorado's governor's race.
   Republican gubernatorial candidate John Andrews has acknowledged
that he spent two years working for an organization that performed
experiments designed to scientifically prove the power of prayer.
   The experiments included prayer sessions with mung beans and
yogurt, among other things.
   Andrews, who faces Gov. Roy Romer in the Nov. 6 general
election, sought to play down his involvement during 1987 and 1988
with Spindrift Inc., saying it ``didn't command a high priority
with me.'' He said Tuesday he later decided to spend his time on
higher priorities ``like public policy in Colorado.''
   Spindrift is an organization that studies parapsychology, a
discipline Andrews described as ``a recognized field on the edge of
exploring new knowledge.''
   Spindrift's goal is to ``explain the relationship between prayer
and healing through the experimental test,'' said Bill Sweet, of
Mount Prospect, Ill., the group's president. ``People for thousands
of years have believed in the power of prayer, but they've had no
proof.''
   In one experiment, 14,000 mung beans were divided into two
groups. One was prayed over and the other was not.
   According to a Spindrift brochure, nearly twice as many sprouts
were counted in the group that was prayed over than in the group
that was not the target of prayers.
   In another experiment, trays of rye grass were correlated with
jars of yogurt and potted plants.
   ``The plants were promised ... more light and the yogurt was
promised milk if more of `their' seeds germinated than control
seeds did,'' according to a book about the experiments, ``Cathedral
of the Mind.''
   ``And,'' it added, ``their seeds did do better than control
seeds.''
   Andrews, who was the group's general secretary during his two
years there, said he became involved with the group in an effort
``to help some friends do some networking.'' He said he thought he
could help them find grants and ways to evaluate their experiments.
   ``All I was doing was using my experience in marketing and
research,'' said Andrews, who is on leave as executive director of
the conservative think tank Independence Institute.

   President Bush may rely on an untested legal
theory to decide which federal programs should be cut sharply next
week in case no deficit-reduction agreement is reached,
administration aides said Wednesday.
   One official acknowledged that the administration is concerned
about invoking such authority because Congress is jealous of its
constitutionally protected role as guardian of the federal purse
strings.
   This official reasoned that any short-term political gain from
bypassing Congress on the spending cuts might be outweighed by a
resulting deterioration of relations between the two branches.
   However, some legal scholars say that if the president is
looking for a way to force spending reductions, he might find
authority in two 1980 advisory opinions by Benjamin Civiletti,
attorney general near the end of the Carter administration.
   The essence of Civiletti's opinions was that ``a president has
inherent authority to protect human life and property'' even when
Congress has not appropriated money for such purposes.
   John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told
Senate Republicans on Tuesday that the Civiletti option is under
active consideration.
   The maneuver could be used as early as Monday. That is Oct. 1,
the first day of the 1991 budget year, and Congress has yet to
enact any of the required 13 annual appropriation bills.
   A ``continuing resolution,'' which would keep federal spending
flowing until Oct. 20, is making its way through Congress. Bush,
however, has promised a veto because one section of the resolution
would delay $85 billion of mandatory spending reductions - called a
sequester - also until Oct. 20.
   Bush says that delaying those cuts would reduce pressure to
write a package of spending reductions and tax increases that would
slash the deficit by $500 billion over five years. He indicated he
will accept no delays in the arbitrary cuts until a deficit
agreement is imminent.
   If by Monday morning Bush has refused to sign the continuing
resolution, there will be no money to run most federal programs.
Nor will there be any money to ``sequester.''
   That is when the Civiletti option might be used.
   The president, invoking his authority to ``protect human life
and property,'' could decide that Defense Department workers should
come to work and that the Justice Department should stay home.
Foreign-aid spending could be frozen, national parks could be shut
down and egg inspectors could be furloughed but the Internal
Revenue Service could be ordered to keep collecting taxes.
   Thus, the president would have spent federal funds despite the
constitutional requirement that any spending be approved by
Congress.
   ``This is an area in which there are no cases,'' Alan Feld, a
Boston University School of Law professor who has written on the
Civiletti opinion and the federal anti-deficiency law in which it
is rooted, said in an interview.
   ``All we've got is the bare statute,'' Feld said. ``The attorney
general's opinion is the most authoritative construction of that at
this moment. But it could be wrong. It is just the advice the
president is getting.''
   Aides to some Republican senators said there was considerable
concern among Republicans about the president's acting in such a
fashion, even though they were reluctant to criticize the proposal
while a deficit agreement was being negotiated.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee and ardent defender of congressional
authority, was more blunt.
   ``On the face of it,'' he said, ``this appears to be nothing
more than a thinly veiled attempt to selectively apply the
sequester.''

   The Ryan White emergency AIDS bill is just
``the symbol of an empty promise'' from Congress, the boy's mother
said Wednesday.
   The disaster-aid measure, named for the Indiana teen who died in
April after becoming a national AIDS spokesman, authorized $600
million in emergency AIDS spending for the nation's hardest-hit
cities.
   However, the bill was severely undercut when a Senate
subcommittee proposed actual spending of only the first $110
million in the coming year, deferring the rest until after Oct. 1,
1991.
   ``My family and I were honored when Congress chose to place my
son's name on the bill,'' Jeanne White said at a news conference at
the capitol. ``But now the act, with no funding, is at best the
symbol of an empty promise.''
   Mrs. White urged members of the Senate to endorse an alternative
introduced by Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash., Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N regulated by the agencies,
said Jim Greene, a spokesman for the inspection service in
Washington.
   ``Obviously, if you don't have federal inspectors, you can't
operate your plant,'' said Gene Meakins, vice president of public
relations for Monfort.
   That could cause ripples throughout the industry, such as a
backlog of cattle at feed yards and higher consumer prices, company
officials say.
   Harry Siegelman, group vice president of cattle procurement for
Monfort, said Wednesday the company won't buy cattle for the week
of Oct. 8.
   ``We are planning on not killing that week, the way it stands
right now with inspection,'' he said.
   Monfort, based in Greeley, Colo., has a Garden City plant that
employs 1,270 people.
   Dave Bartel, a spokesman for Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said
earlier this week that if a budget agreement isn't reached,
Kassebaum has promised a continuing resolution to keep the present
arrangement with meat inspectors until there is an agreement.
   Officials at IBP, which owns a 2,700-employee plant near Garden
City, said they were working through the American Meat Institute in
Arlington, Va., to ensure a furlough doesn't happen.
   ``We're not aware of any slowdowns at this point,'' said Gary
Mickelson, manager of communications.
   He said it wasn't the first time the industry has faced the
possibility of a budget-related furlough of inspectors, but they
were always averted before.
   ``We're hopeful this will be the case this time,'' Mickelson
said.
   Rich Parker, director of information for the American Meat
Institute in Arlington, Va., said members of Congress have been
told that furloughs could hurt the industry.
   ``There's a possibility you could see a shutdown but we don't
think it will happen,'' he said.
   Five giant packing plants in southwest Kansas, including Monfort
and IBP, employ more than 8,200 people. The state ranked first in
the nation in 1989 for the number of cattle slaughtered, at 6.2
million head killed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Wednesday
the odds are mounting that Iraq will launch a military strike in
response to U.N. economic sanctions.
   Cheney told a conference of business economists that the Bush
administration had foreseen that a key danger point in the standoff
with Saddam Hussein would arise once the international sanctions
began crippling the Iraqi economy.
   ``We may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are
beginning to bite,'' Cheney said.
   The U.N. Security Council voted to mpose an economic embargo
against export-dependent Iraq on Aug. 6, four days after the Iraqi
army invaded Kuwait. On Tuesday the Security Council extended the
embargo to include air shipments.
   In a televised address to Americans broadcast Tuesday, Saddam
criticized the United States and the United Nations for punishing
his economy in response to the occupation of Kuwait. Saddam said
U.S. forces deployed in the Persian Gulf area faced the prospect of
bigger losses than were suffered in the Vietnam War.
   Saddam also said this week that he would destroy the Middle
East's oil fields if war broke out.
   ``We have always operated on the assumption since we started
this exercise in early August that there result of the U.N. embargo, which
is being enforced by a multinational naval fleet in the Persian
Gulf, the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea.
   The Pentagon also reported that Iraq has increased its troop
strength in Kuwait and southern Iraq to 430,000 soldiers. The
United States has about 165,000 forces in the gulf area.

<TEXT>
   City University of New York, faced with $42
million in budget cuts, has canceled 2,000 classes, dropped 670
teachers, slashed library hours and limited enrollment, officials
said Wednesday.
   Vice Chancellor Jay Hershenson said cuts were being handled ``in
a way so that the core academic programs are protected and
guarded.'' He said class sizes had increased, however, but he
didn't know by how much.
   Officials said the budget woes were exacerbated by a 2.6 percent
increase in the number of students, bringing total enrollment at
CUNY's 11 four-year colleges and seven two-year community colleges
to 200,121, the highest in 14 years.
   The overall increase in students came as the state reduced its
contribution to CUNY's four-year colleges by $29 million, to more
than $800 million, and the city cut its contribution to community
colleges by $13 million, to $160 million.
   As a result, officials said they had to limit freshman
enrollment to those who applied by the Aug. 6 deadline, rather than
extending it as they have in past years. That resulted in 3,000 to
5,000 freshman applicants being denied admission, Hershenson said.
   To make ends meet, officials canceled 2,000 classes taught by
adjunct teachers and dropped 670 adjunct teachers, 270 at the
senior colleges and 400 at the community colleges. Adjunct teachers
are hired on a semester-to-semester basis rather than under a
continuing contract.
   CUNY also cut library, financial aid counseling and other
services by 93,387 hours, Hershenson said.
   The university's budget this year is $1.1 billion. Tuition is
$1,250 a year for a full-time student.

<HEAD>House Overturns Supreme Court Ruling on Offshore Oil Leasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday to strengthen
coastal states' power over offshore oil drilling.
   The bill, approved 391-32, would overturn a 1984 Supreme Court
decision that allowed the federal government to sell offshore oil
leases without checking to see if drilling complied with state's
plans for its coast.
   ``Back in 1972, we made a bargain with the states,'' said Rep.
Walter Jones, D-N.C., chairman of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, who sponsored the bill, a revision of the Coastal Zone
Management Act.
   ``If they developed coastal zone management programs which met
federal standards and received federal approval, we promised that
federal agencies would adhere to these programs.
   ``The problem is that federal agencies have not lived up to this
bargain.''
   The Supreme Court decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the
Interior Department under President Reagan against California for
trying to stop oil drilling.
   The justices ruled that lease sales for drilling on the outer
continental shelf did not directly affect the coastal zone and
therefore was exempt from California's management program.
   The decision has led to other uses of coastal areas by federal
agencies that sometimes oppose states' management programs, said
Jones' office.
   Jones' bill establishes a new rule that says any federal
activity, including off-shore oil and gas leasing, which affects
any natural resources, land uses or water uses in a coastal zone,
would be subject to state review.
   The bill says that if the state finds the federal activity to be
inconsistent with its plan, it may ask a federal court to halt the
activity.
   A similar bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate. However,
the Bush administration opposes overturning the 1984 Supreme Court
decision and has threatened to veto the legislation.
   The coastal management program includes the U.S. territories and
states on the oceans and the Great Lakes. It is voluntary, however,
and five states - Indiana, Georgia, Minnesota, Illinois and Texas -
do not participate.
   Non-participation means the states do not get federal grants
associated with the program or protection from offshore oil
drilling if this version of the bill becomes law.
   Jones' bill also requires states participating in the management
program to develop a water quality strategy to clean up and prevent
further pollution of coastal waters.
   ``Increasingly, our nation's population is concentrated along
the coast,'' said Jones during debate on the bill. ``I don't need
to remind my colleagues of the environmental problems which we are
facing because of this growth.''

<HEAD>Jackson Will File DC Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Wednesday that he is ``an
honorable taxpayer'' and that he will file a District of Columbia
tax return for 1989, even though it may not be legally required.
   Jackson, who is running for the symbolic job of ``shadow''
senator from the district, a post for lobbying Congress for D.C.
statehood, said he has instructed his accountant to file with the
city a part-year tax form for last year.
   Jackson's decision came after The Washington Times reported
Wednesday that the two-time Democratic presidential hopeful did not
file a local tax return last year, even though he moved his family
to the nation's capital and registered to vote here in August,
1989.
   City tax officials said that even if Jackson had filed the form,
he likely would be entitled to a tax credit and would not owe the
city any money. Both Jackson and a city official agreed that the
law governing his filing requirement is murky.
   ``We discussed the matter further with local tax experts. They
suggested that the law is vague,'' Jackson's office said in a
statement. ``If, through a difference in interpretation, he has
failed to meet a technical requirement in the district, that
requirement will be met immediately by filing a 1989 part-year D.C.
tax form.''
   Jackson's accountant, Lester McKeever of Chicago, originally
determined that Jackson was not obligated to file a district
return.
   Edward Many, acting associate director for audit, compliance and
investigation for the city's finance and revenue department, said
that residents who move to the district are required to file a tax
form for that year only if they live in Washington for at least 183
days of the year.
   Jackson's office said his move to Washington was made official
on Aug. 3, when he switched his voting registration from Chicago.
On that date, there were 151 days left in the year.
   But another part of the city tax code stipulates that if the
person is permanently moving to the district, he must file the
part-year form for that year regardless of when the move takes
place.
   In the statement, Jackson identified himself as a permanent
resident.

<HEAD>Italian Novelist Albert Moravia Dead at 82</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alberto Moravia, one of Italy's most widely read
authors who was censored by both Fascist and Vatican authorities,
died of a heart attack at his home Wednesday. He was 82.
   Moravia's books, many exploring alienation and disillusionment
with modern society, had been translated into all major languages
and inspired at least eight movies.
   In recent years he cut back on his prolific writing schedule,
but made frequent appearances on televison talk shows and
contributed travel pieces to newspapers. An autobiography, in the
form of an interview, was due out within weeks.
   ``Moravia was ageless, with his mental lucidity and constant
presence in the literary and cultural life of our time,'' said
Valentino Bompiani, who published Moravia's works for more than 50
years.
   Moravia had been pronounced in good health by a doctor two days
ago. He died seconds after being striken by the heart attack, said
his doctor, Antonio Severini.
   Moravia and his Spanish wife, Carmen, were married in 1986 when
she was 32. Moravia's body was taken to the Campidoglio, or capitol
hill, where Senate President Giovanni Spadolini and Rome Mayor
Franco Carraro were among the mourners. Funeral services were set
for Friday, and burial will be at the Moravia family tomb in Rome.
   Another major postwar Italian author, Italo Calvino, died in
1985. Italy's Umberto Eco has gained attention in the United States
for several novels, including the bestselling ``The Name of the
Rose.''
   Moravia's novels, often with sexual themes, upset Fascist
authorities in the 1930s and Roman Catholic censors in the 1950s.
   ``La Romana,''' about a prostitute's vain search for love in
postwar Rome, won Moravia world fame. It was first published in
Italian in 1947, and its English edition, ``The Woman of Rome,''
sold 1 million copies in the United States and made him the
best-known Italian writer to many Americans.
   Another major work, ``La Ciociara,'' was set in World War II
when the Allies fought their way from the beaches south of Rome on
the way to liberating the Italian capital. Film director Vittorio
De Sica turned the 1957 book into the movie ``Two Women,'' with
Sophia Loren in an Oscar-winning role.
   In 1952, the Vatican declared all Moravia's novels and stories
immoral and placed them on its Index of Forbidden Books. The list
was abolished following the 1963-65 Second Vatican Council.
   Born Alberto Pincherle in Rome on Nov. 28, 1907, Moravia spent
much of his childhood suffering from a crippling bone disease. He
often said his approach to life and his writing was largely molded
by the boredom of his youth.
   In 1925, while still on crutches, he began his first novel,
``The Indifferent Ones,'' which portrayed the decline of Italy's
middle-class in the first years of Fascism. He paid to have the
book printed in four languages.
   While critics assailed the work, it sold quickly.
   From October 1934 to May 1935, Moravia was in New York lecturing
at Columbia University. His encounter with American culture and
values struck him deeply, and Fascist authorities began to regard
Moravia with suspicion.
   In 1941, the censor seized ``Fancy Dress Party,'' about a
grotesque dictator in an imaginary South American country. Later,
Moravia was forbidden to write at all.
   In 1941, he married writer Elsa Morante. Their marriage ended in
1962. The next year Moravia began living with Dacia Maraini, a
young author and prominent feminist.
   When the Germans occupied Rome in September 1943, Moravia, of
Jewish ancestry and listed as subversive by Fascist police, tried
to cross the Allied lines to Naples. Instead, he spent nine months
hiding with peasants in the mountains.
   His wartime experiences were the basis for ``Two Women'' and
other works.
   Moravia's most prolific years were from 1941 to 1960, during
which he wrote eight novels and several collections of stories,
including ``Roman Tales'' and ``New Roman Tales.''
   After ``Empty anvas'' in 1960, Moravia concentrated on short
stories, essays, film reviews and accounts of his travels,
especially in Africa.
   In 1970, he shocked the literary world with the novel, ``The Two
of Us,'' a dialogue between a sexually hyperactive scriptwriter and
his genitals. Some critics described it as Moravia's surrender to
alienation.
   ``A Ford worker is as alienated as Stalin's subjects; the
employee as the employer,'' Moravia once said. ``Vulgarity and
irreality affect contemporary man.''
   Moravia's concern over nuclear arms led him to visit Hiroshima,
Japan, and thrust him into politics. In 1984, he was elected to the
European Parliament as a representative of Italy's Independent Left
party.

   Americans are eating a record amount of
seafood, including farm-raised catfish and other products, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Per capita consumption was estimated at 15.9 pounds in 1989, a 5
percent increase from the revised average of 15.2 pounds in 1988
and slightly more than the previous high of 15.7 pounds in 1987.
   ``Seafood consumption has risen in eight of the last 10 years
and is up 24 percent since 1980,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said in its report.
   Catfish continues to lead in U.S. aquaculture production, rising
16 percent last year and an additional 11 percent in the first
seven months of 1990, the report said.
   The volume of catfish processed in 1990 is expected to total
between 370 million and 385 million pounds.

<HEAD>Taxing Texas or Rich Americans Would Be Unfair, Critic Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slapping taxes on wealthy Americans and
Sunbelt states to cover the savings and loan bailout would be
unfair, a financial industry consultant said Wednesday.
   But consumer advocates and members of Congress disagreed, saying
people who had profited from government policies that caused the
crisis bear a disproportionate responsibility for fixing the
problem.
   Bert Ely, a conservative advocate of federal deposit insurance
reform, told a task force established by the House Banking
Committee that all taxpayers should shoulder the cleanup burden.
   The thrift crisis resulted from defects in the insurance
program, which benefits the entire nation by keeping the banking
system afloat, he said.
   ``Attempting to impose this loss, particularly in a punitive
manner, on select groups of taxpayers would be unfair and
counterproductive for the economy,'' Ely said.
   ``Our fellow citizens can smell that something is rotten in the
state of America,'' said Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, D-Mass. ``They
demand that they not be stuck paying for fiascos they neither
caused nor profited from.''
   The task force is studying who should pay the hundreds of
millions of dollars needed to rescue the ailing thrift industry.
   Kennedy testified in favor of legislation he introduced that
would levy a 7.5 percent surtax on unearned income, such as
interest and dividends, of people earning over $100,000 a year.
   Corporations earning over $75,000 a year would pay a 5 percent
surtax. And a provision that forgives taxes on appreciated capital
gains at death would be abolished.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., asked for support of a bill he
introduced as chairman of a caucus representing 18 Northeastern and
Midwestern states. Noting that many of the failed thrifts are
state-chartered, he said carelessness and lax regulation by state
governments were a little-noticed cause of the S&amp;L crisis.
   His bill would establish a formula for determining which states
caused an ``excessive'' share of the problem. The governments of
those states would be required to pay into a special fund for the
thrifts they charter to remain eligible for federal deposit
insurance.
   Texas would pay the biggest bill: $2.8 billion. Thrifts in that
state account for 72 percent of the S&amp;L losses, but Texas currently
stands to pay only 6 percent of the cleanup costs, a study by the
Northeast-Midwest Coalition says.
   ``Texas encouraged a massive construction boom and, by abusing
the federal deposit insurance system, has levied a tax on our
citizens to pay for it,'' Wolpe said. ``If that isn't a transfer of
wealth, I don't know what is.''
   Ely, however, said the regional disparity had been ``vastly
overstated.'' For example, although Texas benefited from local
construction projects financed by S&amp;Ls, many of the materials came
from outside the region, he said.
   Task force chairman Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., also voiced
uneasiness about punishing Texas.
   ``Before we get into a new civil war, I want to make sure we do
something that's workable,'' Vento said.
   Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office released a study of
deposit insurance reform options that appeared to support the idea
of broad-based taxpayer responsibility for the bailout.
   Deposit insurance funds ``were never expected to cover
catastrophes and the (thrift) collapse represents an extraordinary
or catastrophic situation,'' said Banking Committee Chairman Henry
Gonzalez, D-Texas, who requested the study.

   President Bush offered faint praise for
Democrats on Wednesday for standing by him on the Persian Gulf
crisis, after blasting them for foot-dragging on a budget accord.
   Speaking at a luncheon for Republican gubernatorial candidate
George Voinovich, Bush said he was ``grateful to the Democratic
leadership for the support they have given'' to his response to the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   ``We need to ... continue to maintain a bipartisan spirit in
support of America's response to Iraqi aggression,'' the president
told his audience.
   Bush praised Democrats for agreeing that politics should ``stop
at the water's edge.''
   Later, in Chicago, Bush met at the airport with a group of
Chicago-based Air Force reservists who had just returned from Saudi
Arabia. He was attending fund-raisers for Rep. Lynn Martin, who is
challenging Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   The president, on a two-day swing through Midwestern states to
speak on behalf of Republican candidates, said the United States
``will not give in to intimidation'' and that U.S. forces will be
brought home ``as soon as possible, when the job is done.''
   Bush also complained to his partisan audience that he was tired
of ``one Democrat after another knocking my socks off on Capitol
Hill'' on capital gains and other tax issues.
   On the budget, Bush said Democrats, not Republicans, are to
blame for the current impasse. ``The hangup is not on capital
gains. The hangup is with tee Democrats on Capitol Hill,'' Bush
declared.
   Bush gave Voinovich a resounding endorsement as the candidate
who would promote education, law and order and environmental
protection.
   He said that as mayor of Cleveland, Voinovich had taken the city
from ``the gloomy dark days of despair'' and brought it into
brighter times.
   Bush also planned stops in Minneapolis, Cleveland and Detroit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, concerned
about signs of poor performance in recent air disasters, is
encouraging changes in flight training to prompt flight crew
members to work as a team, the agency said Wednesday.
   When it first proposed the change early last year, the FAA cited
studies showing that more than 60 percent of fatal airline
accidents were caused by breakdowns of communication in the cockpit
rather than mechanical failures or lack of pilot skills.
   The FAA said then it was clear that in many cases flight crews
did not work well together and therefore did not make use of all
the resources at hand during a crisis.
   The new FAA rule allows airlines the option that airlines use
Cockpit Resource Management training to emphasize crew
coordination.
   According to the FAA such advanced training focuses on
communications skills, coordination and decision-making.
   ``This is a bold new approach to the training of flight crew
members that is sorely needed and one which I believe will enhance
safety and improve cockpit efficiency,'' said FAA Administrator
James B. Busey.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate
Pierre Rinfret on Wednesday refused to attend a GOP unity session
and accused party leaders of trying to pay him to ``shut up, go
away and run a dismal campaign.''
   The civil war within the state's Republican Party continued
after Rinfret refused to show up for a meeting that Republican Sen.
Roy Goodman said was called to ``talk about the unity of this
party.''
   Instead, a Rinfret aide distributed copies of a letter Rinfret
sent to J. Patrick Barrett, chairman of the Republican Committee,
and GOP county chairmen.
   In the letter, Rinfret said he originally planned to attend the
political powwow but that events in the last 24 hours ``have made
my attendance a political impossibility.''
   ``The legislative leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate
have tried to buy me off with a handful of money,'' Rinfret wrote.
``Yesterday, I was offered a grand total of $40,000 to shut up, go
away, and run a dismal campaign for governor.''
   Rinfret was at his Manhattan headquarters and an aide said he
was not available for comment.
   Rinfret had threatened to quit the race against incumbent Gov.
Mario Cuomo in a flap over financing. He accused the state GOP
leadership of hoarding a $3.25 million campaign warchest for their
own benefit.
   On Wednesday, Rinfret continued his attack on Goodman and other
state GOP leaders, saying in the letter they should be forced to
``totally endorse and politically and financially support my
candidacy for governor.''

   The Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq reported
Wednesday that 10 star players from Kuwait's national soccer team
were killed fighting Iraqi occupation troops in the Kuwaiti
resistance.
   It did not say when the athletes died, and said the names of the
players and the clubs to which they belonged were witheld for
security considerations.
   Al-Sharq, quoting an unidentified Kuwaiti refugee, also said
Iraqi occupiers retaliated for Kuwait's successful ouster of the
Iraqi team from Asian games by plundering the premises of the
Kuwait Football (soccer) Federation.
   It said all contents were destroyed and all trophies were taken
away, including the gold cup of the Persian Gulf champion that
Kuwait won in February.
   The Asiad, now being played in Beijing, is the Asian equivalent
of the Olympic games. The Olympic Council of Asia expelled Iraq
before the games started at Kuwait's request.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed it days later.

   Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August,
the government said Wednesday in a report indicating personal
consumption remained reasonably strong despite the Persian Gulf
oil-price shock.
   ``I thought consumption would take more of a hit from the energy
shock, but it didn't,'' said Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics
Inc. in Washington.
   The Commerce Department said spending totaled $3.69 trillion at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up $16.7 billion from a month
earlier. It was the smallest advance since last May, when spending
was unchanged from April.
   The department also said personal incomes rose 0.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.68 trillion, a $13 billion
increase over July. It was the smallest increase since a 0.2
percent gain in April.
   But the department revised the spending increases upward from
0.5 percent to 0.6 percent in July and from 1 percent to 1.2
percent in June.
   ``The upward revisions in June and July showed that consumer
spending ... appeared to be recovering in June and the oil shock
didn't make that much of a dent in it,'' Evans said.
   ``It indicates that consumers are taking a relatively healthy
attitude despite recent evidence in consumer surveys suggesting
otherwise,'' added Gilbert Benz, an economist with Swiss Bank Corp.
in New York.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity. Many analysts have expressed concern since it advanced
just 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, as
measured by the gross national product.
   Benz noted that when consumer spending is adjusted for
inflation, it posted a 0.1 percent decline.
   ``It's the result of the oil shocks we've seen in August and
that continue in September,'' he said.
   Inflation, as measured by the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, rose 0.8 percent in August.
   The department said the savings rate last month - savings as a
percentage of disposable income - was 4.3 percent, the lowest since
a 4.0 percent rate in September 1989. The rate was 4.5 percent in
July and 4.6 percent in June.
   Americans' disposable income - income after taxes - increased
0.2 percent, down from a 0.5 percent gain in July. When adjusted
for inflation, it fell 0.3 percent.
   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -
rose $700 million, a small fraction of the $16.2 billion increase
the previous month.
   On the spending side, the $16.7 billion increase in personal
consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on
debt, was down from a $20.6 billion gain in July.
   Spending on durable goods - ``big-ticket'' items expected to
last more than three years - totaled $480 billion, down $5.9
billion from July. It was the first decline in durable-goods
spending since a $7.7 billion drop in May.
   Non-durable-goods spending, however, rose $11.7 billion to $1.2
trillion following a $1.6 billion gain in July. Spending on
services was up $11 billion to $2 trillion after an $11 billion
gain the previous month.

   W. Robert Trounson, deputy business editor of the
Los Angeles Times, has been named the first civilian chief editor
of Pacific Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military newspaper said
Wednesday.
   Trounson, a 1954 journalism graduate of the University of
California at Berkeley, has worked for the Los Angeles Times for 23
years. In 1974-75, he studied Japanese history, politics, language
and art at Stanford University under a journalism fellowship.
   He was a copy editor and news editor at the Stars and Stripes
from 1963-67.
   The newspaper said Stripes ombudsman Philip M. Foisie
recommended naming of a civilian chief editor last January after
studying allegations of censorship at the paper, including charges
by staff members that senior editors had killed stories critical of
the military or of host countries.
   It said the editor in chief's position was previously held by
the paper's senior military officer, who now holds the title of
commander-publisher, with editorial control delegated to the
civilian chief editor.
   The newspaper is edited in Tokyo and in Europe.
   ``The naming of Bob Trounson as the first civilian editor of
Stripes shows our commitment to provide top-quality news service
for our American readers overseas,'' the newspaper quoted Marine
Col. Walter S. de Forest, Pacific Stars and Stripes
commander-publisher, as saying.

   While New York's famous Carnegie Hall
celebrates its 100th birthday, its little-known counterpart in
southern West Virginia is patching a leaky roof and trying to start
its own musical renaissance.
   ``I think that Carnegie Hall has great potential as not only a
cultural but also as an economic factor,'' said its executive
director, Vivian Conly.
   The Greenbrier County building bearing steel baron and
philanthropist Andrew Carnegie's name was built in 1902 as part of
a women's college, the Lewisburg Female Institute, Conly said.
   Carnegie donated $33,000 to James Lang, an institute trustee,
when several buildings on the campus were destroyed by fire. Lang
and Carnegie were from the same area of Scotland, according to hall
records.
   The donation was used to build a 500-seat theater and performing
arts center. The Greek Revival-style building is across the street
from a colonial church in this town of 3,600, site of a major Civil
War battle.
   The hall lay dormant for many years after the women's college
closed in 1972 and was sold to a state mental hospital. The
building was condemned in 1983, but a citizens' group raised the
money to turn it into a performing arts center.
   The center, with 450 member families, is operated by a staff of
four with a budget of $214,000, said Conly, who became executive
director last year.
   She said she quit her job as advertising director of The
Greenbrier Resort to take on ``a new challenge'' - the hall's
attempted comeback.
   The venue has won praise from performers and patrons for its
intimate setting.
   ``It's a wonderful place to see people because you can see the
expressions on their faces,'' Conly said.
   The hall's performances once were primarily classical but now
include gospel, jazz, bluegrass and folk music, artistic programs
director Mary Leb said Wednesday.
   The Vienna Boys' Choir, the West Virginia Sympony and Taj Mahal
have all performed there.
   A local theater group performed ``Steel Magnolias'' a few months
ago and another play is tentatively lined up for next year.
   But the four-story brick building is in need of extensive
refurbishing, including a new roof, new lighting, electrical wiring
and plumbing, Conly said.
   Some $125,000 has been raised toward a $150,000 roof-repair
project.
   Fund-raisers also hope to bring in revenue from fall classes
taught in the building's art studios and classrooms. Subjects
include painting, sculpture, gardening, calligraphy and French.
   ``For many reasons, it wasn't closely maintained over the
years,'' Conly said. ``It needs a tremendous amount of
restoration.''

   Political offspring are meeting mixed success
as they try to follow in their parents' footsteps in this year's
elections.
   In New Mexico, Tom Udall, son of former Arizona congressman and
secretary of the interior Stewart Udall, is running for attorney
general against a freshman legislator who says he doesn't think the
Udall name is helping his opponent.
   In California, Kathleen Brown, daughter of one former governor
and sister of another, tells voters, ``I'm a different shade of
Brown.''
   In Minnesota, Ted Mondale, son of former Vice President Walter
Mondale, is challenging a state senator who says the younger
Mondale has ``no background of any kind other than that he's worked
in his father's campaigns.''
   Mondale and his opponent, two-term state Sen. Phyllis McQuaid,
both describe their race as a close one.
   ``You take a name as well-known in Minnesota as Mondale, it's
clearly very much of a threat,'' Ms. McQuaid said in a telephone
interview..
   But, she added, ``If his name was Ted Brown, no one would take
the race seriously based on his lack of experience.''
   Her remark recalled another candidate's jab at a political
neophyte nearly three decades ago.
   When Edward M. Kennedy ran for senator from Massachusetts in
1962, state Attorney General Edward J. McCormack Jr., his rival for
the Democratic nomination, jeered ``If your name was simply Edward
Moore instead of Edward Moore Kennedy, your candidacy would be a
joke.''
   Kennedy was 30 at the time, two years younger than Mondale is
now. He beat McCormack, went on to be elected and is still in the
Senate. His son, Patrick, is running for a second term in the Rhode
Island legislature.
   Mondale, whose father was Minnesota attorney general and a U.S.
senator before becoming vice president and running for president,
said the family name can be a handicap as well as an asset.
   ``There are those I think that probably want to punish you
because they feel that everything you have gotten in life has been
handed to you,'' he said. ``I guess you have to go the extra mile
to show who you are and what your background is and what you want
to do.''
   Ms. Brown's father, Edmund G. Brown, and her brother, Edmund
Jr., both served as governor of California.
   ``Having grown up in a political family, I pledged I would never
get into politics,'' she said.
   Now, at 44, with two terms on the Los Angeles Board of Education
behind her, she is the Democratic nominee for state treasurer,
challenging Republican incumbent Thomas Hayes.
   When it comes to fundraising, she said, ``I think there is a
credibility that I have as a candidate walking in the door because
of my family name, but I think once I am in that door, nobody is
going to give money to me if they don't think that I am a credible
and viable candidate in my own right. It doesn't matter what your
name is, people are not in the business of throwing money away on
bad horses.''
   Udall, the nephew of Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., won a lively
contest for the Democratic nomination for attorney general of New
Mexico and is leading his opponent, state Sen. William Davis, in
the polls. An Albuquerque Journal poll found that 87 percent of the
people knew who he was, compared with 18 percent for Davis.
   Davis, a first-term state senator, attributed Udall's big edge
in name familiarity to his previous races for Congress and a lively
primary for the attorney general nomination.
   ``That's the real issue, not his dad's or his uncle's name,'' he
said. ``Those connections help him get money, but I don't think
they help him much in name identification. I don't think we pay
that much attention to Arizona politics in New Mexico.''
   Udall said, ``I ran in a very high profile hotly contested race
in 1988 and we came within 5,000 votes of taking an open
congressional seat. That race, I think had an awful lot to do with
my standing today. I remember when I got in that primary in 1988,
my name identification and my standing in the polls was about 3
percent.''
   ``There is no doubt that people know the Udalls and know my
father's service to the country, and they also ask about it many
times on the campaign trail,'' he said. ``It's usually out of
admiration for what they have done.''
   Honolulu attorney Matthew Matsunaga, son of the late Sen. Spark
Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, did not fare so well in his political outing.
   Matsunaga, 31, campaigned for Congress partly on the basis of
his long residence in Washington and said the network of contacts
made by his father would help him. He finished third in a
three-candidate field in Saturday's primary.
   ``Having a name like Matsunaga created a lot of publicity and
that's what helped with name recognition,'' he said.
   ``The advantage of having a father who was a very popular
politician is that many people are inclined to vote for me simply
because of my father,'' Matsunaga added. ``The disadvantage, of
course, is people who claim that I am simply capitalizing on my
father's name. Some people expect a lot more of me.''

   A federal jury on Wednesday found an
apartment management company guilty of housing discrimination
because it refused to rent units for use by recovering drug
addicts.
   The jury found that Southern Management Corp., had violated the
Fair Housing Act by refusing to lease the apartments to a drug
treatment program operated by Fairfax County., Va., and awarded
$36,280 in damages.
   The civil case is one of the first brought by the Justice
Department to enforce a 1988 amendments to the fair housing law
that bar discrimination against recovering alcoholics or drug
addicts.
   The department's civil rights division has also filed
discrimination suits against communities for blocking group homes
for mentally retarded persons.
   In the Virginia case, the government presented evidence that
Southern Management refused to rent three apartments to the
county-run Crossroads drug rehabilitation program because it did
not want recovering addicts living in the units.
   Recovering addicts who successfully complete a one-year
treatment program move to a group home or apartment for four to six
months, said Justice Department attorney Paul Hancock.
   The jury awarded $10,000 in compensatory damages and $26,280 in
punitive damages. As a result of the judgment, the Justice
Department could seek a court order barring further discrimination
by the company.
   Two other suits were filed in Virginia apartment management
companies on the same day. One has resulted in a consent decree and
the other is awaiting trial, Hancock said.

   House Democrats turned back a GOP effort
Wednesday to rein in lawmakers' use of free mailing privileges in
election years and weaken the role of union political action
committees in financing their campaigns.
   On a 225-194 largely party-line vote, the House rejected a
Republican motion telling negotiators on campaign finance reform to
accept Senate proposals to reduce gifts to a candidate from a
single PAC from $10,000 to $2,000 and disclose how much each
congressmen spends on franked mail.
   ``This is the last chance to get on a stage leaving Dodge that
might actually reach some destination instead of heading for a veto
and politics as usual,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.
   The vote was on a motion to the appointment of 28
representatives to a conference committee that will attempt to iron
out differences between House and Senate versions of campaign
finance reform legislation. The Senate appointed its negotiators
last week.
   Both the House and Senate passed largely Democratic bills just
before the August recess that would establish ceilings on how much
candidates would spend and lawmakers concede their is little chance
that any measure will become law this year.
   President Bush has said he would veto any bill with taxpayer
financing of congressional campaigns even though money raised
though presidential races are already funded through voluntary
checkoffs on tax returns.
   Bush and most other Republicans also adamantly oppose spending
ceilings on grounds that GOP challengers need all the money they
can raise to offset the name recognition of incumbent Democrats,
who hold majorities in both the House and Senate.
   The Senate in July conceded to Bush's demand that PACs be
outlawed, even though lawmakes in both parties acknowledge that
the Supreme Court will likely rule such a ban an unconstitutional
infringement of free speech.
   Included as a fallback position in its bill was a provision
reducing from $10,000 to $2,000 how much a PAC could contribute to
a single candidate for both the primary and general elections.
   The bill approved by the House last month would allow candidates
to get only half of their campaign funds from PACs. PACs of unions
and other organizations that get their money in donations of $240
or less could continue giving up to $10,000 per election.
   But PACs raising their money though individual donations greater
than $240 - chiefly corporations - could spent only $2,000 per
candidate.
   The Senate also would forbid lawmakers from using free mailing
privileges in years they are up for re-election. For senators,
that's just one year out of every six, but for representatives it's
every other year.
   In their effort to change the House's position Wednesday,
Republicans ignored the Senate language on no free mail in election
years. But they called for adoption of other measures in the Senate
bill that would require the reporting every three months of how
much each congressman spends on franking.
   ``Every even-numbered year, we have to approve hiring a virtual
army of part-time employees at an extra cost of hundreds of
thousands of dollars just to move out newsletters,'' said Roberts.
   Postal Service records show that House members' use of the
franking privilege to mail out newsletters free rises substantially
in election years, a practice that Republicans contend is unfair to
challengers.
   For example, the Postal Service estimates its cost of delivering
franked mail from House members was $44.3 million in 1987, rising
to $77.9 million in 1988 and falling back to $57.2 million in 1989.
   This election year, the Postal Service estimates it will have to
spend $78.9 million delivering mail for incumbent representatives,
even though the House appropriated $40.7 million for it.

   During the afternoon, showers and thunderstorms extended from
western and southern New York state across eastern and southern
Pennsylvania and over New Jersey, Maryland and northern Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread from northwestern Kansas

   The United States will begin withdrawing
40,000 troops from Europe next month and start closing down their
units in January, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Wednesday.
   Cheney said his decision was made in consultation with the NATO
allies and was in anticipation of a 23-nation Conventional Forces
in Europe agreement being reached by year's end to substantially
reduce troops and military equipment across Europe.
   ``We have to begin the drawdown now to respond in an orderly way
to changing security requirements and declining defense budgets,''
Cheney said in a statement.
   The unilateral pullout of troops from Europe is the largest by
the United States since the mid-1960s, when the administration of
President Lyndon Johnson restructured the U.S. commitment to
Europe.
   The decision, while not directly related to the buildup of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf area, would give the Pentagon extra
flexibility in fielding troops to spell some of the more than
165,000 American troops now in the gulf region.
   The defense secretary said he ordered Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to remove 30,000 Army and
10,000 Air Force members from Europe, starting in October.
   The United States has about 300,000 Army and Air Force personnel
in Europe.
   Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the affected
units in Europe would be deactivated and the soldiers and airmen
would be transferred to other areas.
   Cheney said that to allow planning time and to ease the
logistics strain, no units will be deactivated before Jan. 1. He
said it normally takes three to four months to close down a
military unit once the deactivation order is issued.
   Under the current U.S. proposal at the conventional forces
negotiations in Vienna, U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe would be
reduced to 195,000 for each side. The Soviet Union says it plans to
remove all its troops from Europe by the mid-1990s.
   In a speech to a conference of business economists Friday,
Cheney, while not mentioning the withdrawal of troops from Europe,
said the Pentagon was ``beginning to adapt to the new world that we
are now fortunate enough to live in in terms of reduced U.S.-Soviet
hostilities.''
   He said the United States would have ``years of warning time''
of an impending Soviet attack in Europe, giving plenty of time to
return U.S. forces to the area.
   Cheney said details on which units will be closed down and a
timetable for the withdrawals will be announced later by the
headquarters of the U.S. Army Europe and U.S. Air Force Europe.
   In its version of the fiscal 1991 defense authorization bill,
the Senate called for a cut of 100,000 in worldwide U.S. forces,
including 50,000 in Europe. The House version of the bill calls for
a total cut of 129,500, including 50,000 in Europe.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, the ranking
Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said Cheney's
action is ``prudent damage limitation'' in light of the deeper cuts
adopted by the House and Senate.
   ``There's a freight train called personnel cuts barreling down
on the department of Defense, so Dick Cheney has done the right
thing by taking steps now to try to soften the blow on people in
the year ahead,'' Dickinson said in a statement.

   Beginning Oct. 3, American military personnel

long-distance operators to make calls home, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. said Wednesday.
   AT&amp;T said its USADirect service enables callers to deal

1-800-100 and an AT&amp;T operator will complete the call to anywhere

   During an introductory period, AT&amp;T will allow U.S. military
personnel in Saudi Arabia to make free three-minute calls to the
United States. The service will be available at most phones from
virtually all U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We want to give all those who are serving in Saudi Arabia a

<HEAD>Iraq Says Food Rations to Foreigners Will Stop on Monday</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq told diplomatic missions in Baghdad
that starting Monday, it will no longer provide them with food
rations for distribution to their communities, diplomats said
Wednesday.
   Tens of thousands of non-Arab foreigners are still in Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. About 6,000 of them are Westerners. They are
banned from traveling, and some are held at key installations and
potential targets in the event of an attack to retake Kuwait by
multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.
   The diplomats quoted a Foreign Ministry memorandum as saying
rations will be suspended as of Monday, Oct. 1, because the latest
U.N. Security Council resolution imposing an air embargo on Iraq
was expected to create major food shortages.
   The memorandum was delivered to all non-Arab missions.
   The Trade Ministry announced another stage of food rationing due
to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
It said Iraq's 17 million people had already received food rations
for September and that October's ration distribution would begin on
Saturday.
   The trade and finance minister, Mohammed Mahdi Saleh, said
rationing will include basic food supplies including rice, flour,
cooking oil, sugar, and tea.
   ``We received a memorandum explaining that the government's
priority is to feed the Iraqi population,'' a Western diplomat
said.
   He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as
did other diplomats who confirmed receiving the memorandum.
   They said they contacted Arab diplomats who told them they had
not received any such notice.
   Officially, Arabs residing in Iraq have rights equal to Iraqi
nationals in accordance with the pan-Arab ideology of the ruling
Baath Party.
   The diplomats said that in September, they received rations for
distribution to their communities. These included rice, flour,
sugar, tea and cooking oil - items that had become sparse because
of U.N. sanctions.
   The diplomats said they did not know how much foreigners would
suffer after the latest decision, because most people had
stockpiled basics.

   Thousands of Vietnamese boat people will be
encouraged to fly home voluntarily or face deportation under a
major United Nations' policy switch, diplomatic sources said
Wednesday.
   ``They will offer the boat people dignity now or deportation
later,'' said a Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The diplomat said it would be the first time U.N. officials
threatened deportation to boat people, who often travel in
overcrowded and unsafe vessels to reach the British colony.
   Previously, U.N. officials did not try to influence boat people
and only accepted volunteers to return home.
   About 54,000 boat people remain in Hong Kong camps, with 9,000
   classified as refugees for resettlement in the West. The other
45,000 are either waiting to be screened for determination of their
status, or have been classified as non-refugees and set for
repatriation.
   Jamshid Anvar, chief of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
for Asia and Oceania, informed diplomats of the new policy, sources
said.
   Britain, Vietnam and the United Nations signed an agreement last
week that says that in addition to volunteers, boat people who
``did not oppose'' being sent back to Vietnam would also be flown
home.
   An official at the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong confirmed
the meeting took place, but declined further comment and said Anvar
was not available.
   Under the agreement with Britain and Vietnam, the United Nations
agreed to monitor returning boat people to ensure they do not face
political persecution or unnecessary economic hardship.
   Anvar told the diplomats Britain has given the new agreement
about three months to succeed.
   If it fails, Britain could begin forcible repatriation of boat
people in 1991, Anvar was quoted as saying.
   The colonial government forced 51 boat people home in December
but suspended the program after international condemnation.
   In late July, Secretary of States James A. Baker III told
Southeast Asin nations the United States still opposed forced
repatriation but could accept the new category of ``those who do
not object.''
   So far, 4,349 Vietnamese boat people have returned from Hong
Kong under a voluntary repatriation program that began in March
1989 with U.N. support.
   Hong Kong stopped automatically allowing boat people to stay in
June 1988. Since then, more than 49,400 have arrived, including
nearly 5,000 this year.

   The White House, claiming there was `no
justification'' for the recent run-up in oil and gasoline prices,
announced Wednesday that president Bush had decided to sell 5
million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The decision to tap the nation's oil reserve as a cannon shot
against soaring prices was announced by White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the decision to put 5 million barrels on the
market was a ``test'' and the president would take ``additional
steps to stabilize energy prices.''
   The reserve contains 590 million barrels of crude oil. It has
never been used apart from a 1-million barrel test sale in 1985
that was not aimed at influencing prices.
   Fitzwater said he expected prices to decline under the
government's sale, but he did not say by how much. Prices have
jumped to about $39 a barrel from $21 before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   Fitzwater said Bush was taking the action to head off ``those
who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions'' against Iraq.
   ``There is sufficient oilto meet current needs,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Oil markets have simply not taken into account additional
production coming on stream.''
   Industry experts have estimated that production in other
countries has restored about two-thirds of the 4.8 million daily
barrels of oil production removed from world markets by Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the world embargo against
Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.
   The United States uses more than 17 million barrels a day, about
half of it imported.
   Fitzwater quoted Bush as saying there was ``no justification for
the intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures'' that has
driven the price about $39 a barrel in the United States.
   Fitzwater said this was the first time that the oil reserves,
which have been held in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana
coasts, have been tapped for usage since they were established in
1975.
   He offered no estimate of how much prices would decline as a
result of the sales, but he did say, ``I would expect it would have
a downward impact.''
   ``Should the oil situation deteriorate,'' Fitzwater said, the
president was ``prepared to bring additional oil on the market''
from the reserve.
   While insisting there is no oil shortage in the United States
``at this time,'' Fitzwater said, ``this test is to make sure the
system works.''
   The spokesman said, ``Frankly, there is no way to justify''
price increases that sent oil soaring from $24 a barrel to $39 a
barrel over the past week.
   ``We need to make it clear that we do have oil available to put
on the market,'' Fitzwater said.
   In remarks prepared for a political fund-raising dinner, Bush
said his action was needed ``because it is especially important
that America is economically healthy and militarily strong.''
   Fitzwater said the president felt the move was especially
important as the nation neared the heating oil season.
   Bush said bids would be taken by the Energy Department for oil
and should be awarding contracts within 15 days and delivering oil
in 15 to 30 days.

   More money is needed to educate
small-town doctors and their patients about AIDS, a national panel
on rural health said Wednesday.
   AIDS caught rural towns unprepared, said Robert A. DeVries,
acting chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health.
   ``There has been a sense that AIDS would not strike rural
America,'' he said. ``We've now seen a 37 percent increase in the
number of rural AIDS cases in one year compared to a 5 percent
increase among urban populations,'' he said, citing U.S. Centers
for Disease Control statistics for 1988-89.
   ``I think we see a surprised, relatively unprepared community of
people,'' said DeVries, a program director for the W.K. Kellogg
Foundation of Battle Creek, Mich.
   The committee, which advises Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis W. Sullivan, ended a three-day meeting Wednesday.
   Among the AIDS-related recommendations adopted by the panel were
suggestions that the federal goverment fund studies to collect and
distribute data on the incidence of acquired immune deficiency
syndrom in rural areas.
   Other recommendations included a toll-free hot line to provide
information on AIDS to the rural health care community.
   ``People living in cities have had 10 years to learn about AIDS,
how to treat it and how to protect yourself from getting it,'' said
Pat Taylor, a program analyst for Office for Rural Health Policy.
``People in rural areas are just starting to learn.
   ``Some of the attitudes remind you of 50, 60 or 70 years ago
when people used to keep members of their family who were mentally
ill in the attic,'' Taylor said.
   The group also said an existing CDC program that provides
information on social services and federal benefits for AIDS
patients should be expanded.
   ``It's such an urban-orientated issue now,'' said Jerry Coopey,
a senior analyst for the rural health policy office. ``There's a
great deal of money going for AIDS in places like Chicago,
Washington or New York. But rural areas are being affected too. We
just want to get our fair share.
   The recommendations will be reviewed before being submitted to
Sullivan at year's end in the advisory committee's annual report,
DeVries said.
   The advisory group interviewed three AIDS patients, including
Michael Goff, a 33-year-old former social worker. Goff, who was
diagnosed with AIDS two years ago, told the group that rural AIDS
patients face challenges never considered by their city
counterparts.
   ``In this state, I do see people who are so afraid of what the
public is going to find out, they don't get treatment or they do
not seek benefits or they do not complain when they are
discriminated against,'' he said.
   He said he formed a support group out of loneliness after his
diagnosis.

<HEAD>GOP Group Files Complaint Against Annunzio Campaign</HEAD>

   A Republican political organization charged in
a formal complaint Wednesday that the campaign of Rep. Frank
Annunzio failed to identify 20 contributors as officials and
spouses of a Gaithersburg, Md., bank.
   Annunzio, an Illinois Democrat, called the accusations ``the
product of my desperate opponent.'' Annunzio, who has served 26
years in the House, is chairman of the House Banking subcommittee
on financial institutions, and No. 2 Democrat on the full
committee.
   The Chicago lawmaker faces Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz
in November.
   The complaint by the National Republican Congressional
Committee, the political organization of House Republicans, was
filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   U.S. election law says a campaign treasurer must make a ``best
effort'' to obtain the name, address, occupation and the employer
of a contributor.
   The complaint cited a Sept. 22 story by the National Journal,
which said 20 of Annunzio's contributors were officials and spouses
of Standard Federal Savings Bank, of Gaithersburg, Md.
   The Annunzio campaign, the complaint said, was ``able to obtain
the name of the employer of every other individual who contributed
during this period.''
   Each of the 20 persons made two $200 contributions during 1990,
for a total of $8,000.
   ``Mere probability makes it extremely unlikely that fully
one-fifth of those contributors ... could, by coincidence, both
work for or be directly associated with a single institution - and
be the only 20 of one hundred for whom employers name was
unavailable,'' said the complaint.
   Annunzio said he has ``done nothing wrong.
   ``I am prepared to go before any government body ... to answer
any questions,'' said Annunzio. ``I have nothing to hide.''
   The FEC is obligated to launch a preliminary inquiry into any
complaint not initiated by its own staff. The election law sets
maximum penalties of $10,000 for willful election law violations
and $5,000 for less serious violations.
   Earlier this month, after news stories appeared about the
contributions, Annunzio said there was nothing wrong with the
donations - even though he was opposing a proposal that could have
hurt the institution.
   On March 28, Annunzio's subcommittee held a hearing on the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposal, which involved mortgage
servicing agreements. The proposal would have adversely affected
Standard's business. The FDIC dropped it after Annunzio's hearing -
which included testimony against the plan.

<HEAD>Tutu Says Media Misrepresent South African Tribal Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bishop Desmond Tutu said Wednesday that
news reports misrepresent tribal violence in South Africa's black
townships when they focus on the ``black on black'' angle.
   ``The violence is mainly for political reasons over ideological
political turf,'' the anti-apartheid activist said at Brown
University, which presented him with an honorary degree.
   ``We're no more divided than any other normal community,'' he
said.
   Tutu wondered aloud why the strife in Northern Ireland wasn't
characterized as ``white on white,'' as the ``black on black''
violence is in South Africa.
   About 800 blacks have died since fighting began outside
Johannesburg in early August between the African National Congress
and Inkatha. Both organizations oppose apartheid, South Africa's
policy of racial separation, but differ on plans for the country's
future.
   ``This is the frustration of people who have been deprived for
so many years,'' said Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize for peace in
1984 for his work against apartheid. ``The cost may be slightly
higher than we thought.''
   Tutu also questioned President F.W. de Klerk's commitment to his
stated goal of ``one man, one vote'' for South Africa. But he said
de Klerk, who met with President Bush on Monday, ``must be given
considerable credit for his courage'' in trying to move the country
away from apartheid.
   But Tutu said the world looks more to African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela as South Africa's spiritual leader.
   He contrasted the adulation given Mandela when he visited the
United States earlier this year with de Klerk's lower-profile visit
with Bush on Monday.
   ``It's as different as chalk and cheese,'' he said.
   Tutu also reiterated his call to Bush to retain economic
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``It indicates whether you are on the side of the oppressed or
the oppressor,'' he said.
   The president has indicated he might lift the sanctions if the
government releases political prisoners and lifts the state of
emergency in black townships.
   The bishop also said he had no qualms about accepting honors
from Brown University, which has $635,000 invested in South Africa.
Tutu has turned down similar honors from schools that had South
African investments.
   But Robert Reichley, Brown's vice president of university
relations, said Brown has reduced its investments from $33 million
in 1984, and half of the remaining $635,000 is held by the school
on behalf of others, including alumni.
   Asked if that amount was significant, Tutu replied: ``I would
think that would be debating how many angels dance on the point of
a needle.''

   A U.S.-led task force met Wednesday to discuss
providing billions of dollars in economic assistance in the Persian
Gulf crisis but failed to resolve several disputes that are
plaguing the fund-raising plan, officials said.
   The talks, which involved more than 65 officials representing
over 20 nations, were held to launch the Gulf Crisis Financial
Coordination Group. President Bush announced formation of the group
in a speech Tuesday.
   A senior U.S. Treasury official, who briefed reporters after the
meeting ended, said the countries were in strong agreement that
economic assistance to seriously affected countries was a critical
element in the campaign to isolate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   However, he conceded that the organizational session adjourned
without resolving such key issues as how much money would be needed
or even which countries would qualify for the funds.
   The issue of how much each donor country would be asked to
contribute was also left undecided, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It was not our purpose at this first meeting to settle
numbers,'' he said. ``The purpose of this meeting was to try to
reach agreement on certain issues dealing with process and
procedure.''
   The official said a working group of lower-level officials
headed by Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara would meet
again within a few days to lay the groundwork for resolving some of
the outstanding issues at a second meeting of the coordinating
group, scheduled for Oct. 12.
   The October meeting will be chaired by Treasury Undersecretary
David C. Mulford.
   Bush unveiled the coordinating group in a speech at the opening
session of the IMF-World Bank meetings, saying the informal panel
was needed to organize the fund-raising effort.
   Cees Maas, deputy finance minister of the Netherlands who
participated in the discussions, said the group agreed on the goals
but that there were no specific commitments made on amounts to be
donated.
   ``We agreed that this has to be done quickly and that
coordination is necessary,'' he said.
   Before the meeting began, British Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major said he had heard figures ranging from $8 billion to $18
billion for the amount of money being sought.
   U.S. officials, however, put the American request in a more
narrow range of $13 billion to $15 billion. Some European countries
contend that this amount is too high and should be scaled back to
about $9 billion.
   The U.S. plan would target the assistance to Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey. The administration fears that without substantial aid the
resolve of those key ``frontline'' states to support the campaign
against Iraq might crumble.
   However, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reportedly objected to the
inclusion of Jordan in the aid package. Both countries have
criticized Jordan for being reluctant to support the U.N. trade
embargo against Iraq.
   The U.S. official who briefed reporters said the issue of aid to
Jordan was not resolved at the meeting.
   He said some countries are pushing on the other side to expand
the definition of frontline states to include countries other than
Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. That issue was also left unresolved, he
said.
   For his part, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
stressed that the proposed assistance package drawn up by the
United States should be viewed only as a starting point for
discussions and the final details would come only after donor
nations had time to review the proposal.
   Japan has already pledged $2 billion for the economic assistance
package and another $2 billion to support the U.S. military buildup
in the Mideast.
   Publicly, no finance minister was willing to criticize the
makeup of the U.S.-proposed steering committee, which will have
both its chairman and vice chairman come from the administration.
Brady will serve as chairman and his deputy will named by the State
Department.
   The World Bank and the IMF were to supply technical support.
   Both agencies have pledged to supply billions of dollars from
their own resources to help cushion the shock to poor nations from
the doubling in world oil prices and other economic fallouts such
as a flood of refugees from Kuwait and Iraq.
   In a speech to the IMF-World Bank annual meeting Wednesday,
Brady appealed for a ``united economic front'' against Saddam.
   ``The economic strength represented by all of you in this room
must be mobilized to demonstrate collective resolve and make clear
our intention not to yield to aggression,'' he said.
   The nations participating with the United States in the crisis
coordinating group included Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and South Korea.
   The group also was to include representatives from the 12-nation
European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council of Persian Gulf
countries.

<TEXT>
   Police patrols have been increased
where five slayings occurred in this college - town reportedly
after laboratory tests failed to link evidence with anyone on the
list of suspects.
   The Gainesville Sun said it's uncertain whether the test results
actually cleared any suspects in the stabbing deaths, or if they
just failed to support existing suspicions.
   Sgt. Dick Gerard, a spokesman for the 150-member joint task
force investigating the slayings, refused to say whether any of the
lab results pointed to a specific suspect or cleared any suspect.
   ``We will not discuss any piece of evidence,'' Gerard said
Wednesday.
   He said analysis of evidence is continuing and it may be four to
six months before all the lab work is completed.
   Police are still interested in two identified suspects, Edward
Lewis Humphrey and Stephen Michael Bates, Gerard said. Both are
jailed on unrelated charges and neither has been charged in the
Gainesville deaths.
   ``Mr. Humphrey is one of the individuals we are looking at,''
said Gerard, who repeated the same sentence, inserting Bates' name.
The spokesman said he doesn't use the word suspect when discussing
the case.
   Earlier, police said they had a pool of eight suspects. Gerard
said the pool fluctates daily and could be as high as 30 or 40.
   Since the slayings in late August, police have frequently
cautioned that the killer may still be roaming the streets of
Gainesville. Four of the victims attended the University of
Florida; one was a student at the city's Santa Fe Community
College.
   Police declined to comment on the newspaper's report Wednesday
that patrols in southwest Gainesville were increased in part
because crime lab results did not implicate a suspect.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified law enforcement sources and
also cited the apparent failure of intense searches of woods
frequented by Humphrey, an 18-year-old freshman at the university,
for the increased patrols.
   ``We are continuing to urge students and others to be extemely
careful. Since arrests have not been made and no charges have been
filed, we should assume that this is not solved in any way,'' said
Art Sandeen, vice president for student affairs at the University
of Florida.

<TEXT>
   - A cult leader's son who aided his
father in the ritualistic murder of four family members should be
sentenced to life in prison, a jury recommended Wednesday.
   Prosecutors had asked the jury to recommend the death sentence
for 19-year-old Damon Lundgren, who wept when he told jurors
Tuesday he didn't want to die.
   After four hours of deliberation, the jury recommended that
Judge Paul M. Mitrovich sentence Lundgren to life without a chance
of parole for at least 20 years on each of four aggravated murder
counts. Jurors didn't specify if the sentences should run
concurrently or consecutively.
   Mitrovich set sentencing for Oct. 5.
   The same jury convicted Lundgren on Sept. 18 of four counts each
of aggravated murder and kidnapping in the April 17, 1989, shooting
deaths of Dennis Avery and his three daughters. He was acquitted in
the slaying of Avery's wife, Cheryl.
   The Averys were bound, gagged and shot to death, then buried in
a barn in Kirtland, about 30 miles east of Cleveland.
   Lundgren's father, Jeffrey Lundgren, admitted to the killings.
He said he was a prophet who was directed by God to kill the Averys
because of their altering beliefs in the cult he founded. He has
been sentenced to death.
   His wife, Alice, was sentenced to five life terms for
conspiracy, complicity and kidnapping in the Avery deaths.
   According to trial testimony, Damon Lundgren helped wrestle to
the ground and bind Dennis Avery before he was shot and served as a
lookout while the other four were shot.

   The Senate voted Wednesday to require
federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents of
teen-age girls who seek abortions.
   The action came on an amendment to a bill renewing federal
family-planning assistance, which emerged as the latest
battleground in the political war over abortion.
   The bill was already under a veto threat, however, and the vote
was one in a series of conflicting and confusing Senate actions
that left the bill facing an uncertain future.
   A vote to limit debate fell 10 short of the necessary 60 votes,
diminishing prospects of any further action on the bill itself.
   The Senate approved by a large margin another amendment Tuesday
evening that would nullify Bush administration regulations
prohibiting the family planning clinics from offering any
information or counseling involving abortion.
   The result was a Senate bill that contained provisions pushed by
both anti-abortion and abortion-rights forces.
   In the House, meanwhile, a similar version, extending the life
of family planning services provided through Title X of the Public
Health Service Act of 1970, was approved by the Energy and Commerce
Committee without any of the controversial Senate provisions on
abortion. The clinics offer family planning and health services to
the poor.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman and an
abortion-rights advocate, said he would push for enactment of a
bill without the Senate's abortion provisions as a way to avoid a
presidential veto.
   ``I think our best chance to reauthorize Title X is to send a
simple continuation of the program,'' Waxman said.
   The family planning act's authorization expired in 1985, but
services have been funded by Congress each year since then through
so-called continuing resolutions, or catchall spending measures.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill's sponsor, said the
action on parental notification means the Senate turns ``our back
on millions of teen-agers.'' But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
suggested Democrats had only pushed the bill to force President
Bush's veto and said the services would again be funded regardless
of the bill's outcome.
   ``Nobody is going to be denied those funds,'' Hatch said.
   The Senate accepted the parental notification amendment, offered
by Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., on a unanimous voice vote after
narrowly defeating a motion to table, or kill, the amendment. That
key vote against tabling was 54-43.
   The requirement for parental notification applies only to
organizations that receive federal money to provide family planning
services to the poor, in cases where girls under age 18 seek
abortions.
   Those organizations are prohibited from using federal money for
abortions, but Armstrong said more than 30 perform abortions at the
same clinic that provides federally supported family planning
services.
   ``In almost every jurisdiction you have to have the permission
of your parent .... to give blood,'' Armstrong said. ``But there is
a surgical procedure for which that is not required, and it is
abortion.''
   Armstrong was thwarted in his first attempt to offer the
amendment Tuesday evening. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., used
parliamentary means to block a direct vote on Armstrong's
amendment, but on Wednesday Armstrong succeeded in attaching his
language to an unrelated amendment.
   ``There are no funds, no funds whatsoever, that are involved in
abortion,'' Kennedy said, referring to federal money.
   The Senate's vote Tuesday night to nullify the administration's
prohibition on abortion counseling provided abortion-rights
advocates with a surprisingly large 62-vote majority.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., an abortion opponent,
voted with abortion-rights advocates in support of the amendment,
producing an initial 63-35 vote. But more than an hour after the
vote was taken, Dole asked that his recorded vote be changed to
``no.''
   Dole, who arrived late for the vote, simply made a mistake, said
his press secretary, Walt Riker.
   ``He just made a mistake when he voted,'' Riker said.
   Doug Johnson, lobbyist for the anti-abortion National Right To
Life Committee, said he had expected to lose by about a 60-40 vote.
   ``There were a couple of guys who screwed up and were
confused,'' Johnson said. ``... That didn't help having the
Republican leader confused.''

   Students upset over the acquisition of a
controversial sculpture and other matters took over two buildings
at the University of the District of Columbia on Wednesday and
demanded a meeting with the board of trustees and the mayor.
   The students also are demanding removal by Mayor Marion Barry of
11 of the 15 trustees, according to Mark Thompson, spokesman for
the student group.
   Thompson said some issues have been neglected by the board. ``We
need to get rid of the board of trustees,'' he said.
   Barry was ``very sympathetic and in fact emphatic with our
demands,'' Thompson said.
   A Barry spokeswoman said the mayor was waiting to see whether
the students and university officials can work out an agreement.
   ``The mayor is not going to get involved at this time,'' Barry
spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said. ``He wants to see if they can reach
some kind of accommodation. He is watching the situation closely,
however.''
   The 200 demonstrators took over the main administration building
and a nearby building housing the university radio station,
bookstore and several offices and classrooms.
   They met briefly with interim President Miles Fisher IV in his
office and agreed to leave the third floor of the building after
officials said they could remain on the first two floors.
   University spokesman John Britton said the takeover was
peaceful. Thompson said students had no desire to ``brutalize our
beautiful institution.''
   Thompson said the demonstration had the support of a majority of
students on the campus. `We are a strong unified group. If they
(other students) are not inside with us, they are outside
supporting us.''
   Evening classes were cancelled on the main campus, but classes
were scheduled for the Mount Vernon Square campus several miles
away downtown, and officials were trying to get in touch with the
15 trustees, Britton said. The students turned down a chance to
meet with the chairwoman of the trustees, Nina Hardon Long.
   ``It was too late. It's tragic she had to wait until something
like this happened to call a meeting,'' he said.
   The students had sent a list of 20 demands to the board on
Monday, including one calling for the resignation of Ms. Long and
two board colleagues.
   Ms. Long was instrumental in acquiring ``The Dinner Party'' by
feminist artist Judy Chicago, a ceramic sculpture depicting the
history of women in 39 dinner table settings, many containing a
representation of female genitalia.
   The students protested that the acquisition threatened student
and other university programs since the House of Representatives
voted to reduce the university's operating budget by the $1.6
million the board voted to spend in renovating a library to house
the work.
   The Senate did not make a similar reduction, and a conference
committee will have to produce a reconciliation of the two
versions.
   No university money was spent on the sculpture itself, which was
a donation.
   Students had also said earlier they were upset with high
turnover in the faculty and top administration, and that they had
no voice in the decisions made by the trustees.

   President Bush has decided to sell $7.5
billion in new weaponry to Saudi Arabia in immediate response to
the Persian Gulf crisis, and to ask Congress' consent for another
$14 billion next year, sources said.
   The package, which was to be submitted formally to Congress late
Wednesday or Thursday, includes M-1A tanks, TOW anti-tank missiles,
Bradley fighting vehicles, trucks and armored personnel carriers,
said congressional and administration sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Also included are Patriot anti-missile batteries, although far
fewer than the 20 or so originally proposed, and some Apache
ground-attack helicopters, the sources said.
   Items in the package are those which are either in current U.S.
stocks, can be delivered quickly, or must be ordered soon to meet
Saudi defensive requirements in the standoff with Iraq, the sources
said.
   Weapons which will take longer to deliver or which meet future
Saudi force needs, such as F-15F fighter planes, will be in the
package Bush will send to Congress in January, they said.
   The administration split the arms sale into two parts after
supporters of Israel on Capitol Hill complained that the original
request for some $21 billion in weaponry was too large and was
being pushed through too quickly.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., a staunch supporter of Israel, said
informal assurances he had received led him to believe the new
package would pass congressional muster.
   ``This is a significant improvement'' over the original $21
billion package proposed by the administration, Levine said. ``This
is what should have been proposed in the first place.''
   Levine said lawmakers concerned about Israel's security support
Bush's military moves to counter Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
But the earlier, larger arms sale proposal appeared to be an
attempt ``to use the crisis as justification for sending items not
needed for the crisis,'' Levine said.
   At the same time, the administration has been discussing a new
package of military aid to Israel and senior officials have
promised to maintain Israel's qualitative military advantage over
neighboring states.
   Israel's backers said that they expect little objection in
Congress to the administration's new proposal because of strong
bipartisan support for President Bush's policy in the Middle East
and Saudi Arabia's clear defensive needs.

   A small group Wednesday marked one month of a
round-the-clock peace vigil, and pledged to stay at the city park
until the Persian Gulf crisis is peacefully resolved.
   The ``PeaceWorks Park Vigil'' began spontaneously Aug. 26 when
activists attending a peace-oriented concert at Gas Works Park
decided they had to do something about the heightening tensions in
the Middle East.
   The group of 20 agreed to keep up the 24-hour vigil, even if it
meant sacrificing work and family life and giving up the amenities
of indoor living.
   ``The reason we're still here is that the situation in the gulf
today is just as bad as what motivated us to start the vigil in the
first place,'' said Joseph Mabel, one of the spokesmen for the
group.
   The ``vigilists,'' as they call themselves, say the group has
numbered as high as 240 and as low as two or three at any one time.
Participants trade shifts, and they say there has always been
someone present.
   The group discussed how to prevent hangers-on from diverting the
purpose of the vigil and how to keep members participating when
winter weather comes.
   Visitors to the popular park on Seattle's Lake Union pass by a
makeshift camp with rugs, recycling bins, bicycles, canned foods
and a small library of peace-oriented books.
   The group is united in a call for an end to U.S. military
involvement in the Persian Gulf, but beyond that statement each
participant speaks individually.
   However, most share the belief that the Bush administration has
sent U.S. troops to the region for cheap oil, rather than for any
lofty ideal such as creating a stable world order.
   Vivian McPeak compares the U.S. policy to that of ``a junkie
ready to fight anyone for his next fix.''
   Added Karen Hill, ``This is a war of businessmen and bankers,
but businessmen and bankers are never the casualties.''
   Some in the group call themselves pacifists. But not John Hatch,
who recently left the military after seven years of service.
   ``I personally wouldn't mind if the U.S. cleaned Saddam
Hussein's clock and got out of there,'' Hatch said.
   But he said he doesn't believe that's possible, and fears the
United States will become bogged down in a long, bloody war.
   Hatch, who decided to quit his job as a janitor to participate,
said the group's number is increasing as passers-by learn of the
vigil and join up.
   One of the visitors Wednesday was former Rep. Mike Lowry,
D-Wash., who lost a Senate race after 10 years in Congress before
becoming a Seattle University professor of political science.
   ``We need to be asking ourselves, `Is it worth it to send our
young people off to die for cheap oil?''' Lowry said. ``There are
things worth going to war over. To go to war over oil is wrong.''

<TEXT>
   The diplomatic war in the Persian Gulf
escalated on another front Wednesday - between Jordan and Saudi
Arabia. Jordanian newspapers called Saudi officials ``warmongers''
who outdid Israel and the West in acting against Arab interests.
   The newspapers were reacting to Saudi Arabia's cutting off oil
supplies to Jordan and expelling more than 30 Jordanian Embassy
employees on charges of spying for Iraq.
   Officials in Amman sought to play down the division, hoping it
will heal. But many Jordanians expressed bitterness and defiance.
   ``Let them drink their oil. We do not need them,'' said Ali
Tobassi, a Jordanian waiting at a bus stand Tuesday. ``We will
sweat to earn our daily bread and we prefer to starve rather than
take their money.''
   Jordan's Arabic-language daily Al-Rai said the Saudis seem to
consider opposition to foreign troops in the gulf to be directed at
them and sought ``to punish us in terms of halting oil supplies and
accusing our embassy staff of espionage.''
   ``This means the sister state of Saudi Arabia has virtually
decided to declare a real war against the Jordanian and Palestinian
people,'' it said.
   A multinational military force, including tens of thousands of
U.S. troops, has assembled in the Saudi desert following Iraq's
blitz takeover on Aug. 2 of the small oil sultanate of Kuwait
adjoining Saudi Arabia. Jordan has supported Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in the confrontation, but said Wednesday it will halt all
flights to and from Iraq to comply with a U.N. air embargo.
   Jordan's conservative Arabic-language Ad-Dustour was
particularly incensed by remarks Tuesday by Saudi Foreign Minister
Prince Saud al-Faisal that force was the sole option for getting
Iraq out of Kuwait.
   It said in a front-page editorial, ``Saud al-Faisal has outdone
the warmongers of Israel, Britain and even the United States in
their campaign against Iraq.''
   Saudi Arabia ordered 20 Jordanian diplomatic personnel out of
the country on Saturday and 12 more on Tuesday. Jordan indignantly
reported the move on national radio, and recalled its ambassador in
protest.
   Saudi Arabia took the measures to express outrage over Jordan's
pro-Iraqi stance and at what it saw as Jordanian attempts to
undermine its government.
   Prince Bandar bin Sultan al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador in
Washington, wrote an open letter to Jordan's King Hussein deploring
what he called a defense of Iraq's ``horrifying acts of rape and
destruction'' in Kuwait.
   Jordanian officials chose their words carefully in response.
   ``We do not understand why our brethren in Saudi Arabia are
lashing out at us,'' said one senior official. ``I am sure that
this is a misunderstanding which will be sorted out and I hope that
will be soon.''
   ``I am sure all these differences will be solved,'' said a
senior Foreign Ministry official, who, like the other official,
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He denied that Jordanian officials in Saudi Arabia had spied on
military installations.
   Western diplomatic sources, speaking privately, said evidence
existed that some Jordanian Embassy employees acted individually on
behalf of Iraq without the knowledge or permission of their
government.
   Some officials in Amman first refused to acknowledge that Saudi
Arabia, long a source of huge monetary grants to Jordan, had
actually expelled Jordanians.
   But the reduction of Jordan's diplomatic staff to eight drove
Amman authorities to going public.
   Jordan recalled Ambassador Naser Batayneh ``to protest such a
Saudi action which is seen as inexcusable,'' said a Foreign
Ministry statement read on the official Jordan Radio.
   The Saudis appeared especially angered over a pro-Iraqi
conference in Amman last week that urged the overthrow of oil-rich
Arab rulers and attacked Riyadh for allowing deployment of Western
forces to protect it against possible Iraqi aggression.
   Last week, Saudi Arabia cut off oil supplies to Jordan, claiming
Jordan owed $46 million in oil payments. Jordan denied it.
   The conservative, English-language daily Jordan times declared:
``Jordanians cannot be perplexed by these Saudi actions. . . . Be
that as it may, Jordan will not give in and will continue to
advocate its beliefs that what is going on in the Arabian peninsula
and around it is extremely dangerous, particularly to Saudi
interests and the Arab people at large.''

   The Soviet legislature formally ended decades of
religious repression on Wednesday, giving overwhelming initial
approval to a law on freedom of conscience at a time when Soviets
are flocking to churches in record numbers.
   ``Our people suffered to get this law,'' said Mikhail Kulakov, a
leader of the Soviet Union's Seventh Day Adventists, who have been
persecuted for evangelical activities.
   The law forbids the government from interfering with religious
activities, improves the legal status of religious organizations
and gives Soviet citizens the right to study religion in homes and
in private schools.
   The Soviet constitution has long guaranteed freedom of worship,
but in the past the Communist Party's ideological opposition to
religion as the ``opiate of the masses'' made that guarantee
hollow.
   In practice, the government discouraged religious services,
closed churches and synagogues, imprisoned religious leaders and
preached atheism.
   ``The most important thing for us is not only that the law is
passed, but that it begins to work,'' said Adolph Shayevich,
Moscow's chief rabbi.
   Peter Reddaway, an expert on Soviet religion at George
Washington University in Washington, said in a telephone interview
``there is reason for optimism the law will be respected.''
   He noted that official tolerance for religion has increased
since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
Gorbachev's mother is a practicing member of the Russian Orthodox
Church, and last year he acknowledged he was baptized as a child.
   ``The authorities have been loosening restrictions for a couple
of years, and now they're putting it in writing,'' Reddaway said.
   He said Western experts estimate that a quarter of the 285
million Soviet people practice religion, and the number is rising
fast.
   Among signs of religious revival are increasing numbers of
seminarians and the reopening of churches that were used as
storehouses, garages and even factories.
   Three years ago, Gorbachev held talks with the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, the first such meeting in more than 40
years. In December, he met Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.
   Bibles are no longer confiscated at Soviet borders, holiday
church services are shown on television and religious publications
are flourishing.
   On Sunday, a Divine Liturgy was held in the Kremlin's Uspensky
Cathedral, the first full service allowed in Russia's most
important cathedral since 1918.
   Jews are also enjoying greater religious autonomy, including
freedom to study Hebrew, which previously had been suppressed.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church, outlawed by Josef Stalin in 1947,
has come out from underground and reclaimed some of its property.
Under the new law, it can apply to local authorities to regain
lawful status.
   In Soviet Central Asia, where Moslems predominate, attendance at
mosques has risen and copies of the Koran are in heavy demand.
   The new law, which passed 341-1 with one abstention, says the
government will not ``restrict the study, financing or
propagandizing'' of religion. It was not a roll call vote and the
identity of the person who abstained was not known.
   Atheism remains the doctrine of the Communist Party, but the law
prohibits the government from funding either religious activities
or atheist propaganda.
   It allows religious groups to set up societies and send people
abroad for spiritual study.
   In the past, religious organizations had no clear legal standing
and were unable to makecontracts or represent themselves in court.
Under the new law, they have the same status as individual
citizens.
   But a clause allowing public schools to be used for religious
classes after regular hours set off a fierce debate and was
defeated by one chamber of the legislature.
   While the bill was easily passed into law, a legislative
committee is scheduled to go into session on Monday to settle
provisions still in dispute - principally the public school issue
and taxation of donations to religious organizations.
   Patriarch Alexi II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, urged
the legislature to ensure that government officials do not come
between the church and the people.
   ``The Russian church has already experienced attempts on a
political basis to destroy the unity of religious life,'' said the
patriarch, who wore a black robe and majestic white headdress
topped with a gold cross.
   Shortly after the 1917 Revolution, many priests were shot and
the Bolsheviks began an anti-religious propaganda campaign.
   During World War II, Stalin revived the church to help lift
morale and patriotism.
   But in the 1950s, Premier Nikita Khrushchev undertook a major
anti-religion campaign, closing approximately two-thirds of the
Orthodox churches, seven out of 10 seminaries and the majority of
monasteries.
   Khrushchev's ouster in 1964 ended the campaign, but there was no
significant restoration of church property or religious rights
under his successor, Leonid Brezhnev.
   Reddaway said the Soviet Union has about 50 million Moslems, 30
million Russian Orthodox believers, 6 million Catholics, 2 million
Jews and 1 million Baptists. But he said the percentage of Moslems
who practice their faith is uncertain.

   Supporters of voter initiatives Wednesday
blamed calculating opponents and bungling bureaucrats for a court
ruling that threw five of the measures off the ballot.
   A judge Monday tossed five of the 11 statewide initiative
measures off the Nov. 6 ballot because of a technicality. The state
is appealing the decision. One of the measures would have allowed
tax credits for parents who send their children to parochial
schools.
   Jim Andersen, canvassing director of Oregon State Public
Interest Research Group, said Oregonians overwhelmingly favor his
group's initiative to ban some non-recyclable packaging.
   ``Now, because of bureaucratic inefficiency and a well-organized
and powerful opposition, hundreds of thousands of people's votes
across the state will have no value and that's not right,'' he said
at a rally.
   He noted that Oregon was the first state to implement the
initiative process 88 years ago whereby voters can get issues on
the ballot by petition.
   Marion County Circuit Judge Richard Barber ruled the measures
invalid Monday because they don't contain statements on their
estimated financial effects. The statements weren't included
because of an earlier court ruling saying state officials missed a
deadline for formally approving them.
   Opponents of the measures argued it was illegal to allow them to
appear on the ballot without the financial statements.
   Another ballot measure invalidated by the ruling would shut down
Oregon's only nuclear power plant, about 40 miles northwest of
Portland, until waste disposal requirements are met.
   Anti-nuclear activist Lloyd Marbet told the rally that Trojan
nuclear plant operator Portland General Electric Co. perpetrated a
``clear manipulation of the political rights of this state,'' when
it participated in the attempt to have the measures invalidated.
   A spokesman for the utility, Steve Sautter, has said the company
feels it is important for voters to know the economic impact of
shutting down the plant.
   Other measures affected by the ruling would limit property taxes
to 1.5 percent of value and establish a jobs program for welfare
recipients.
   The education measure would have allowed tax credits of up to
$2,500 a year each for pupils at private schools, including
church-supported schools, and for children taught at home.
   Backers of that measure didn't attend the rally, which drew just
a few dozen people.
   In Salem, a spokesman for House Speaker Vera Katz said Wednesday
a special legislative session is among options being considered to
get the measures back on the ballot if the ruling stands.
   ``We're absolutely not, at this point, pushing for a special
session,'' said the spokesman, Dan Field. ``We certainly hope this
thing will be resolved in the courts. If it's not, the Legislature
should be prepared to consider all options. That may or may not
include a special session.''
   The Legislature would have authority to refer the measures to
the ballot or could pass a law saying the measures will be on th
ballot despite the foulup.

   The German people will never forget the
suffering their country brought on Europe, and particularly the
Jews, during World War II, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Wednesday.
   Addressing the 45th General Assembly one week before East and
West Germany will be reunited, Genscher said, ``In this historic
phase the Germans are filled with a sense of history and
responsibility.
   ``They are not being carried away with nationalistic exuberance.
   ``We will not forget the endless suffering that was brought upon
the nations of Europe and the world in the name of Germany.''
   ``We commemorate all the victims of war and tyranny,'' the West
German minister added, ``and we recall especially the untold
suffering inflicted upon the Jewish people. We are aware of and
accept our responsibility.
   ``We Germans are uniting in the determination that none of this
must ever be allowed to happen again.
   He thanked the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet
Union for their swift cooperation in completing the reunification
treaty with Germany, a nation divided into capitalist West and
communist East after World War II.
   The treaty was signed on Sept. 12.
   Genscher then declared, ``We Germans want nothing other than to
live in freedom and democracy, in unity and peace with our
neighbors.
   ``We reaffirm our renunciation of the manufacture, possession
and control over nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
   ``The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever
against other states and will not assert any in the future. The
inviolability of national borders is a cornerstone of Europe's
peaceful order.
   ``The united Germany will confirm the existing German-Polish
border in a treaty that is binding under international law.''

   A carrier-based helicopter carrying
17 American sailors had to ditch in the Red Sea during a training
mission Wednesday, but all aboard were rescued unhurt, the Navy
said in a statement.
   It said the SH-3H Sea King anti-submarine helicopter, carrying
four crew and 13 passengers, splashed down about 5,000 yards from
the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy.
   Such copters are sometimes used on minesweeping runs, but the
statement did not identify the training mission and Navy officials
were not immediately available for comment on the 8:30 a.m. crash.
   The statement said the sailors were given medical examinations
after being rescued and all found to be in good health.
   It said the helicopter stayed afloat for about two hours after
the crash, but sank before it could be hauled from the water.
   Cause of the accident was being investigated.
   The Kennedy is among the warships enforcing economic sanctions
on Iraq and assisting in the defense of Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>Actor Marlon Brando Courting Multimillion-Dollar Bids for His
Memoirs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publishers are lining up to offer millions of
dollars for the rights to an autobiography by Marlon Brando,
according to the reclusive actor's adviser.
   ``He is writing and many publishers are making bids for the
rights,'' attorney Belinda Frixou was quoted in Wedneday's Los
Angeles Times.
   She refused to say how much he'd been offered.
   Warner Books' Ellen Herrick said her firm's $2 million offer
already has been rebuffed. Officials at Viking Penguin and Pocket
Books, Simon &amp; Schuster's mass-market publications division, said
they are in the competition.
   In a recent interview with Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd,
Brando said he wouldn't hold back in writing about his tumultous
career and private life.
   ``I have no inhibitions,'' the 66-year-old actor said. ``There
isn't anything I won't go into. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.''
   Frixou said Brando isn't writing his memoirs to raise money to
pay legal fees for his son, Christian Brando, who goes on trial on
murder charges next month.
   The actor put up his Los Angeles estate last month to secure his
son's bail.
   The younger Brando is charged with the shooting death last May
of his half sister, Cheyenne's, lover, Dag Drollet. He told police
the shooting was an accident.
   The elder Brando is writing his memoirs without the help of a
ghostwriter, Frixou said.
   ``He's doing it totally himself, he's a very good writer and has
done scripts before.
   ``There've been so many different books about him, unauthorized
biographies, that it is about time to set the record right and give
everybody the correct version,'' she said.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Says Independence Lacks Attention of Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

   The spiritual leader of Tibet said Wednesday the
international outrage following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is absent
with the Chinese occupation of his mountainous homeland because it
lacks oil.
   ``There are also some big differences between 40 years ago and
today,'' he said, referring to the Chinese takeover. ``Even if the
gulf crisis had happened a few years ago, the situation would be
different.''
   The Dalai Lama and many of the 6 million Tibetans believe the
area should be an independent nation. China claims Tibet is a part
of its territory.
   The Dalai Lama, 55, was invited to Canada by the country's small
Tibetan community. He has lived in exile in Dharmsala, India, since
he fled Tibet with some of his followers after a failed uprising in
1959.
   The 14th Dalai Lama in a line that dates to the 14th century, he
is considered a god-king to his people. In 1989, he was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize for his work.
   An acknowledged ``half-Marxist,'' he said the doctrine has
failed because it is too rigid.
   ``It can work against human nature and that is why it declined
and collapsed'' in Eastern Europe, he said.
   ``I think a new age is beginning,'' he said, noting the changes
in Europe the past year came from ``an essentially non-violent
peoples' movements,'' he said. ``I think it is quite safe to say
the next century will be more harmonious.''
   In 1987, he proposed a five-point peace plan to the Chinese as a
first step toward resolving the status of Tibet. In 1988, he
proposed a self-governing Tibet working ``in association'' with
China.
   But the Beijing government has not taken the plan seriously,
particularly since the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters last
year, he said.
   ``They are only interested in my return. I told the Chinese
government that my return is not the main issue. The main issue is
the 6 million people of Tibet,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union and the European
Community on Wednesday jointly denounced Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait and said they are ready to consider applying
more pressure on the Baghdad government.
   Their joint statement was released after Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis of
Italy, current chief of the EC.
   It read, ``The European Community and its member states and the
Soviet Union urge the Iraqi authorities to allow immediately all
foreign citizens who so desire to leave Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Time does not work for the aggressor. It will only strengthen
the determination of the international community to repeal the
aggression and to fully restore Kuwait's sovereignty.''
   The Soviets and 12-nation EC vowed to cooperate fully to see
that the trade embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait is enforced, and
said they are ``also prepared to consider additional steps
consistent with the U.N. Charter.''
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III noted
Tuesday that such steps could mean letting a U.N. military
operation resolve the situation.
   The Soviet Union and European states also expressed their
resolve to work together to help settle other Middle East
conflicts, such as the Israeli-Arab confrontation, the Palestinian
problem, and the Lebanese civil war.
   Their statement said efforts should be made to ``curb the arms
race and to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction'' in the Middle East.
   The Kremlin and EC stand ready to help nations in the region
``in establishing a comprehensive structure in the region and in
drawing up to that end a set of rules capable of fostering peace,
tolerance, stability, economic cooperation and development,'' it
added.

<HEAD>Pirates Hijack Cypriot Ship, Steal Cargo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. organization expressed concern Wednesday at
the skill of sea pirates who last month stole a cargo of 2,000 tons
of sheet steel worth about $1.8 million from a vessel off Thailand.
   Abhy Ankar, information officer of the International Maritime
Bureau, said pirates in Southeast Asia ``are definitely becoming
more professional. In this case they were very well-prepared.''
   The bureau is based in London and investigates maritime crime.
   Ankar said pirates in the region usually targeted Vietnamese
boat people - refugees fleeing communist-ruled Vietnam - but the
bureau was also looking into attacks on commercial vessels.
   Ankar said the Cypriot-registered ship Marta was raided on Aug.
8, 24 hours after it left Bangkok for Busan, South Korea, with a
cargo of steel.
   He gave this account:
   Four attackers with pistols and metal bars began firing on the
ship at around midnight. They seized control and handcuffed the
crew, then repainted the ship's funnel and changed the vessel's
name to V-Tai. They replaced the Cypriot flag with one of a
different nationality.
   The pirates told the crew - Dutch captain, two European officers
and four Filipino ratings - their lives would be spared. The ship,
then off the Thai-Cambodian coast, kept south for two days until it
reached a pre-arranged position.
   The crew then was locked in a cabin and the cargo was unloaded
into what the crew believed was a motorized barge or small vessel.
   The pirates stayed aboard, forcing the crew to sail toward
Bangkok. After two days the pirates took a lifeboat and supplies,
drugged the captain and took him hostage, and destroyed the Marta's
communication equipment.
   The rest of the crew were told to sail to Bangkok.
   The Marta went aground near Bangkok harbor and a Thai naval
patrol vessel picked up the crew. The pirates later handed the
captain over to a fishing vessel.

   Marlon Brando burst into tears
outside a courthouse Wednesday after accusing prosecutors of
hounding his ailing daughter to testify at her brother's murder
trial.
   The actor's display of emotion came at a brief news conference
following a hearing at which a judge refused to reduce the
first-degree murder charge against his son, Christian. The younger
Brando is accused of fatally shooting his half-sister's Tahitian
lover, Dag Drollet.
   The portly actor said he was offended by the prosecution's
unrelenting efforts to force his daughter, Cheyenne, to return from
Tahiti as a witness.
   He noted she recently gave birth to a son and said she has
suffered severe injuries and a nervous breakdown.
   ``Cheyenne has suffered enormously,'' Brando said. ``She's been
beaten physically. ... She's suffered a head injury where her face
was smashed and she had to have her face remade.
   ``She's suffered a nervous breakdown,'' he continued. ``She's
had to be in a sanitarium under a doctor's care and for that man
(the prosecutor) to keep chasing my daughter is unspeakable. As a
father, I am deeply offended.''
   Brando's comments concerning Cheyenne's facial injuries refer to
a car accident in which she was severely injured last year. But the
reference to beatings was unclear and when he was asked whether he
meant to suggest that her dead lover had beaten her, Brando refused
comment.
   Christian Brando's lawyers have suggested that Cheyenne, 20,
complained of such beatings to Christian on the night that Drollet,
26, was shot to death at Marlon Brando's estate in the hills above
Los Angeles.
   Marlon Brando, 66, appeared composed until he was asked about
Cheyenne's baby boy, born shortly after the May 16 killing.
   ``Tooke is doing fine,'' he said of the baby. ``He's healthy and
strong. Cheyenne is doing her best. ...'' At that point Brando's
eyes filled with tears, he lowered his head and began crying. He
then rushed away.
   Superior Court Judge Robert W. Thomas upheld a Municipal Court
judge's ruling that there was sufficient evidence to support
Christian Brando's prosecution on a charge of first-degree murder.
   He scheduled a hearing for Monday to consider a prosecution
request to delay the scheduled Oct. 9 trial date while authorities
continue their legal efforts to bring Cheyenne Brando back to the
United States to testify.
   Christian Brando, 32, who is free on $2 million bail,
accompanied his father and a brother, Miko, to the courthouse. At
the news conference outside, he was reticent, but was urged forward
by his father.
   ``I'm just glad to be here,'' he said. ``I just want to go
through with this and prove my innocence.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union were
unable Wednesday to iron out their differences on unfinished
treaties to reduce conventional and long-range nuclear weapons.
   But the Soviets hinted at progress and another round of
high-level talks was set tentatively for Thursday afternoon.
   ``We're at a point where the issues are rather technical,'' a
senior U.S. official said.
   Failure to reach agreement on the accords could force
postponement of a 34-nation summit meeting in Paris in
mid-November, interrupt the easing of East-West tensions in Europe
and delay a trip to Moscow in December by President Bush.
   The pivotal talks were held by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in a
mid-town hotel about a mile from the United Nations where they
voted on Tuesday to impose an embargo on cargo shipments by air to
Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   The aim is to force Iraq to withdraw from the oil-rich emirate
in the Persian Gulf, which it seized Aug. 2, sending tremors
through world oil markets and touching off hoarding and price
rises.
   ``On quite a few questions there is progress,'' Shevardnadze
said at the conclusion of the meeting, which took nearly four
hours. He did not specify which questions he had in mind.
   ``But in order to carry these thru to the end we'll have to meet
again,'' he said.
   The senior U.S. official who briefed reporters later under rules
that shielded his identity said Baker and Shevardnadze had
recommitted themselves to completing the two treaties by the end of
the year.
   He said they ``laid out some ideas,'' which he declined to
describe, and would take them up again at their second meeting.
   Asked if any of the remaining issues had been resolved, the
official replied: ``They are still unsettled.''
   In a drive to complete the treaties, U.S. and Soviet negotiators
met separately from Baker and Shevardnadze, continuing discussions
they began last week in Washington.
   The Soviet group is headed by Viktor P. Karpov, a deputy prime
minister and veteran arms specialist, and the U.S. delegation by
Under Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew.
   Shevardnadze suggested a lot of work remains to be done. ``There
are so many problems,'' he told reporters through a Russian
translator.
   Baker said they also dealt ``a good bit with cooperation'' at
the United Nations and added: ``We ran out of time, quite
frankly.''
   At the United Nations the two superpowers are working in tandem
to tighten the economic screws on Iraq by denying the President
Saddam Hussein's government all trade except for humanitarian food
supplies.
   A senior U.S. official briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity said the Soviets had backed away from any attempt to link
the Persian Gulf crisis to other area problems such as the
Arab-Israeli dispute and the future of the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Also, he said the Soviets ``want to give a new impetus to the
proliferation issue'' and agreed to work more closely with the
United States, once the Gulf crisis is over, to halt the
proliferation of nuclear and chemical warfare technologies in the
region.
   Baker began the meeting thanking Shevardnadze for a strong
speech at the United Nations on Tuesday condemning Saddam and for
the way the Soviet foreign minister chaired the Security Council
session.
   Shevardnadze said he was operating under a ``directive'' from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to break the deadlock in the
negotiations over reducing non-nuclear arsenals in Europe.
   He said the two sides had ``to find a solution.''
   Two weeks ago, when Baker was in Moscow, they decided to
jettison any attempt to limit the size of U.S. and Soviet troop
concentrations in Europe under the treaty.
   They also considered abandoning limits on non-nuclear aircraft,
as well, but deferred a decision.
   The question is whether all land-based aircraft should be
included, as the United States proposed, or whether planes the
Soviets say have defensive missions should be exempted from
restrictions.
   Another unresolved issue is whether any single member of NATO or
the Warsaw Pact should hold no more than 30 percent of permitted
weapons, as the Bush administration proposes, or be allowed up to
40 percent, as Moscow favors.
   Also, the two sides have not agreed on verification procedures.
   Last week, R. James Woolsey, the chief American negotiator, said
the United States would seek postponement of the Nov. 19 Paris
meeting if agreement was not reached on a draft treaty in time.
   ``It's hanging in the balance,'' Woolsey said in Brussels.
   He said once a draft was ready the negotiators would need four
to six weeks to translate about 200 pages of text and another 200
pages of data into six languages.
   ``We can't wait until midnight on Nov. 18 to decide things,'' he
said.
   The treaty would impose ceilings on tanks, anti-aircraft
artillery, helicopters and armored personnel carriers.
   Negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 16
members and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact began in February 1989
after more than 15 years of negotiations on a similar accord ended
in failure.
   East Germany, where some 350,000 Soviet troops are stationed,
dropped out of the Warsaw Pact on Monday and will merge with West
Germany, a NATO member, on Oct. 3. The oviets have agreed to
withdraw the troops in phases.
   Bush predicted in May 1989 that the new treaty would be
concluded within six months to a year.
   Also lagging is a treaty to reduce by about 30 percent U.S. and
Soviet stockpiles of long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines.
   Bush hopes to sign the treaty at a Moscow summit with Gorbachev
in December.
   But three key issues are unsettled. They are:
   -The kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy,
ground-based SS-18 intercontinental missiles the Soviets will
retain under the treaty.
   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon and counted against the bombers the Soviets can
retain under the treaty.
   -The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies - from the United States
to Britain, for instance.

<HEAD>Two Women Charged in Child-Selling Scheme</HEAD>

   Two women were arrested on felony
child-selling charges Wednesday after one allegedly paid $3,000 for
the other's newborn, officials said.
   Authorities were investigating whether one of the women, Nellie
Cutright of nearby Mayport may have been involved in other
child-selling cases over the past nine years.
   Ms. Cutright, 45, was held in the Duval County Jail on $50,000
bond on one count of child-selling and one count of insurance
fraud, Assistant State Attorney E. McRae Mathis said at a news
conference.
   Virginia Underwood, 25, of Pensacola, was charged with
child-selling for turning over her newborn daughter, Kayla, to Ms.
Cutright for $3,000 when the baby was born about a month ago,
Mathis said.
   Ms. Underwood, who surrendered to authorities and is cooperating
with investigators, has been released on her own recognizance, he
said. Her whereabouts could not be determined Wednesday by The
Associated Press. Pensacola is 360 miles west of Jacksonville.
   Prosecutors charge Ms. Cutright, wife of a Navy sailor, checked
Ms. Underwood into Memorial Medical Center in Jacksonville under
her name.
   When Ms. Underwood had her baby, she was paid $3,000 for giving
the child to Ms. Cutright. Hospital bills and expenses were paid by
the military's insurance under the false impression that it was Ms.
Cutright who had the baby, Mathis said.
   The baby, which was with Ms. Cutright at the time of her arrest,
has been placed in state custody, Mathis said.
   Mathis said investigators found blank and altered birth
certificates, photographs and altered military dependent
identification cards in Ms. Cutright's home in government housing
near Mayport Naval Station.
   The documents ``lead us to believe that there was some sort of
ring going on in which a number of children have been sold or
otherwise transferred from their natural mothers to other people.''
   Mathis said investigators are looking into alleged child-selling
activity in Florida, Missouri, Virginia and Texas extending back as
far as nine years at prices as high as $25,000.
   The child-selling and insurance-fraud charges are third-degree
felonies punishable by up to five years in prison, Mathis said.

   Several soldiers were being held in
connection with the decapitation of an Illinois man who ran a
tourist lodge in Guatemala, an army spokesman said Wednesday.
   Col. Carlos Fernando Duran said the soldiers were at the Santa
Elena military base in the northern province of Peten.
   He refused to say how soliders were being held, but several
local newspapers and a television station reported there were four.
   Michael Devine, 49, was found slain on June 9 two miles from
Poptun, a town about 240 miles northeast of Guatemala City near the
border with Belize.
   The Belleville, Ill., man owned the Xobel de Poptun Inn. He also
worked as a tourist guide and transported goods for ranches in the
area.
   Duran said the soldiers were being held on the order of a judge
in Flores, the provincial capital. He did not say if other suspects
also were being sought.
   Earlier this month, President Vinicio Cerezo said in a letter to
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Strock that ``people linked to the security
forces could be responsible'' for Devine's death.
   The president said he had changed the posts of military
authorities ``so that for no reason can obstacles to development of
the investigations or judicial process crop up.''
   Also this month, the U.S. State Department issued a travel
advisory for Guatemala, citing ``indiscriminate terrorist
attacks,'' crime and fighting between the armed forces and rebels.

   Three Iraqi passenger planes landed in Jordan on Wednesday, but
Jordan said later it will halt all flights to and from Iraq to
comply with a U.N. air embargo. Iraq accused Washington of bribing
Moscow to back the U.N. sanctions.
   New threats meanwhile emerged against foreigners in Iraq and
Kuwait. Diplomats in Baghdad said the government told their
missions it will no longer provide food rations for distribution to
their communities as of Monday.
   They said an Iraqi memorandum sent to all non-Arab missions
blamed the air embargo imposed Tuesday, saying it was expected to
create major food shortages. Iraq imports about three-quarters of
its food.
   About 1,000 Americans and 5,000 other Westerners are among tens
of thousands of non-Arab foreigners stranded by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of the oil-rich sultanate.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in New York on
Wednesday that Iraq has threatened the death penalty for anyone
hiding foreigners in diplomatic embassies. He said he rejected the
threat as ``repugnant'' and also rejected an Iraqi demand for names
of people given sanctuary in the embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait.
   Baker said the Iraqi note was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad.
   In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat denied
Wednesday night that Iraqi officials made any such threats.
   In a sign that U.N. sanctions are hurting Iraqis, Baghdad
announced Wednesday it would extend rationing to rice, flour and
cooking oil.
   The West was also feeling the economic impact of the crisis. Oil
prices have jumped to about $39 a barrel from $21 before the
invasion.
   Saying ``no justification'' existed for the run-up in oil and
gasoline prices, the White House announced President Bush had
decided to sell 5 million of the 590 million barrels of crude oil
in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   Earlier Wednesday in Washington, Iran's minister of economic
affairs and finance, Mohsen Nourbakhsh, asked nations with huge oil
stockpiles to help restore stability to oil markets by tapping
their strategic reserves. But Bush was not acting in response to
that request.
   The United States reportedly planned ``a show of force'' by
sending its first aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf in 16
years, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warned that an Iraqi
military strike was increasingly likely.
   Cheney told a conference of business economists in Washington
the Bush administration had foreseen a key danger point in the
standoff with President Saddam Hussein would arise once sanctions
began crippling Iraq's economy.
   ``We may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are
beginning to bite,'' he said.
   Congressional and administration sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Bush has decided to sell $7.5 billion in new
weaponry to Saudi Arabia in immediate response to the crisis, and
to ask Congress' consent for another $14 billion next year.
   About 165,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in the Saudi desert
and aboard ships in the region. Thousands of Arab and European
troops have also been deployed as part of the U.S.-led
multinational force, assembled to deter any Iraqi thrust against
Saudi Arabia and its vast oil holdings.
   U.S. officials encountered reservations Wednesday by allies on a
fund-raising campaign to collect the billions of dollars needed in
the gulf crisis. Representatives of some of the 20 American allies
met in Washington.
   A West German official said some European countries questioned
whether a new U.S. goal of $14.5 billion in aid for nations facing
Iraq overstated the need. Saudi officials questioned whether
Jordan, criticized for being reluctant to oppose Saddam, should get
aid.
   The new air embargo was tested Wednesday by the Iraqi landings
in Amman, Jordan.
   Passengers aboard the regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways flights
landing there included nine expelled French diplomats and 11
Britons stranded by the invasion. It was not known what the cargo
holds contained. The planes all returned to Baghdad.
   Jordanian officials first said the passenger aircraft were not
included in embago resolution passed Tuesday by the U.N. Security
Council.
   But Foreign Minister Marwan Kasim later said in New York in a
statement at U.N. headquarters that Jordan would comply fully with
the embargo and halt passenger flights to and from Iraq, including
freedom flights for Westerners.
   Baghdad's official news agency accused Moscow - a former ally -
of being bribed by the United States and gulf sheiks to oppose
Iraq. It said the tone of a tough U.N. speech Tuesday by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ``clearly shows the bribe
given by American and its allies the oil sheiks.''
   Iraqi officials announced new food rationing will begin this
weekend. Trade and Finance Minister Mohammed Mahdi Saleh said sugar
and tea also will be affected by the new restrictions. The
government already closed fast food restaurants and many pastry
shops because they use large amounts of sugar.
   Bakeries still open make only bread, which has been rationed
since Sept. 1.
   The Security Council already has authorized military enforcement
of a sea embargo. The air embargo is largely symbolic, since most
trade with Iraq is by land and has already been halted. Iraq's only
major export is oil.
   Also on Wednesday:
   -Cheney ordered 40,000 troops removed from Europe within a year
to respond to declining defense budgets. The decision has no direct
connection to the U.S. deployments in the gulf area.
   -U.S. military sources in the gulf said the carrier Independence
was expected to sail into the gulf within the next few days,
bringing it within 500 miles of Iraq. The carrier, with 70 attack
jets, would be the first such U.S. warship in the gulf in 16 years.
   -A carrier-based SH-3H Sea King helicopter carrying 17 sailors
ditched in the Red Sea during a training exercise but all were
rescued unhurt, the Navy said. The copter sank after landing about
5,000 yards from the carrier John F. Kennedy, it said.
   -U.S. Marines defending Saudi oilfields were told by their
commander to expect a long desert stay. Gen. Alfred Gray also said
the Marines should be prepared to shift to offense if Saudi Arabia
is attacked.
   -In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Iraq had rounded up at least seven more Americans, bringing to
about 100 the number being detained. Many have been taken to
military and industrial complexes to deter a potential U.S.
military attack.
   About 1,000 Americans remain in Kuwait and Iraq, denied
permission by Iraq to return to the United States.

Motion Picture Association of America in favor of a new NC-17
rating that bars children but does not carry the commercial stigma
of the X.
   Filmmakers hope the new rating, effective immediately, will
carry none of the advertising and exhibition restraints that an X
rating guaranteed. They maintain that the X rating had become
synonymous with hard-core pornography, and served no purpose in
evaluating artistic films best suited for adults.
   The R rating, which bars unaccompanied minors from certain
films, remains intact, as does the PG-13, PG and G ratings.
   ``It's a great step,'' said Philip Kaufman, director of the
X-rated Universal Pictures film ``Henry &amp; June.'' The historical
drama, which features some explicit sex, was set for a ratings
appeal next week and will be the first recipient of the new NC
rating, which would bar children under age 17.
   ``I'm just really delighted that we can show this film uncut in
America and show the film the way I made it,'' Kaufman said. ``It
is not intended as a prurient film.''
   The old X rating meant no children under 17 allowed, but states
had the option to set a higher age cut-off. Under NC-17, states
also will have that option, says William Kartozian, president of
the National Association of Theater Owners, who predicted that a
few will raise the rating to NC-18.
   It was unclear whether newspapers and television and radio
stations, which tend to reject advertisements for X-rated films,
would be more inclined to carry ads for movies bearing the NC-17
mark.
   The new rating will be copyrighted, the MPAA said at a New York
news conference. The X rating was not and is used widely by the
adult movie industry.
   Films that got an X rating from the MPAA will be switched to
NC-17 at the request of the film's owner.
   The new NC-17 rating cannot be used by porno producers unless
they submit their films to the MPAA for review, which they never do
because it costs money.
   Most theater chains refuse to show X-rated films, regardless of
artistic merits.
   Kartozian predicted most of those theaters will show NC-17
movies.
   For months, a variety of directors and film producers have
sought a change in the ratings system.
   Other X-rated films aimed at mainstream moviegoers included
``Hardware,'' ``Frankenhooker,'' ``Henry: Portrait of a Serial
Killer,'' and ``Life is Cheap ... But Toilet Paper is Expensive.''
   The announcement marks a significant about-face by the MPAA. Its
president, Jack Valenti, had maintained during months of complaints
that the procedure worked.
   ``It's fair to say we've received justifiable criticism,''
Valenti said Wednesday in New York. ``It's no one's fault, but the
X rating has a patina, a complexion which frankly we never intended
it to have. By renaming it NC-17, we hope we will convey to the
movie world there are any number of reasons for a film to get this
rating.
   ``We hope this will clarify that we are not making judgments on
X-rated films,'' Valenti said. ``I wanted to make sure if a change
was made, it was reasonable, sane, wise and beneficial to the
parents.''
   Coupled with the new rating, the association also will provide
theater owners and critics with more detail on films with an R
rating and why exactly they received it: sex, violence, language.
   Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, was
especially relieved by the decision. Several of Miramax's recent
releases have been rated X. They include ``The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife &amp; Her Lover'' and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' from
Oscar-nominated director Pedro Almodovar.
   ``I think this is a great step forward,'' Weinstein said.
``Miramax is delighted to have played a significant part in the
battle against censorship in America. This just goes to show that
being tenacious without waving the flag can get the job done.''
   Before the announcement, Valenti had been adamant in his defense
of the previous system. He said the ratings continued to provide
useful guidelines to parents.
   ``If you add another category, you're asking the rating board to
make judgments about artistic integrity,'' Valenti said in July. He
maintained Wednesday that he had not compromised.
   The last time the ratings were changed was in 1984, when the
PG-13 rating was added between the PG and R ratings. That change
was prompted by ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''
   A number of films during recent years have been rated X, but the
frequency of the rating became newsworthy as critics and theater
chains pressed for a new rating category.
   Other X-rated films have included 1969's ``Midnight Cowboy,''
1973's ``Last Tango in Paris,'' 1969's ``if...'' and 1971's ``A
Clockwork Orange.''

   A former state lawmaker admitted
Wednesday that he sold his vote and tried to persuade other
lawmakers to take bribes.
   Robert Kohn was one of 10 lawmakers caught in the web of an FBI
investigation of the South Carolina Statehouse. The Republican from
Charleston pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count, the fourth
lawmaker to plead guilty.
   Kohn is cooperating with investigators and resigned his seat as
part of a plea bargain. The conspiracy count carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
   During a hearing before U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins,
prosecutors showed a videotape of Kohn pocketing $2,500 on a yacht
off Hilton Head Island last April 14.
   Kohn admitted the money came from lobbyist Ron Cobb, although
Cobb is not seen in the picture. Cobb was working undercover for
the FBI, agent Mike Clemens testified, and met with Kohn last fall.
   They discussed Kohn's support of a bill allowing voters to
decide whether they wanted to allow pari-mutuel betting.
   Kohn promised to support the bill for $10,000. He also said he
would try to get other lawmakers to sell their votes, Clemens said.
He said Kohn accepted $2,500 from Cobb on Jan. 16 and another
$2,500 on the yacht.
   A legislative effort to move the bill to a vote failed earlier
this year. Kohn, 45, had been a state representative since 1975. He
declined comment because of a gag order imposed by the judge.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Calls For Better Assessment of Priorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   EPA Administrator William Reilly called
Wednesday for a re-examination of the nation's environmental
priorities to focus more attention on the areas of greatest risk.
   Reilly, in an address to the National Press Club, said limited
resources to deal with the vast number of environmental issues
facing the country must not be wasted on low-priority items.
   He released a report by the agency's Science Advisory Board
which concluded that too many agency decisions are made because of
publicily perceived health risks, and not risks based on scientific
research.
   The report said, among other things, that EPA should ``attach as
much importance to reducing ecological risk as it does to reducing
human health risk.''
   The advisers grouped problems into high, medium and low risk
areas.
   Oill spills, groundwater pollution and radioactive isotopes pose
relatively low risks, they said.
   Pesticides, acid rain and surface water pollution were examples
of what they said were medium-risk areas.
   The high-risk group consisted of four problems: global warming
from the ``greenhouse effect,'' depletion of the ozone layer, loss
of biological diversity and extinction of species and destruction
of natural environments such as rain forests.
   Reilly and his predecessors have expressed chagrin that the
agency, at congressional direction, spends billions of dollars
every year on cleaning up toxic waste dumps - which among other
things pollute groundwater - and much less on more serious
environmental and health risks.
   ``We must do a better job in setting environmental priorities,''
said Reilly. He urged a ``broad, robust national dialogue''
involving the EPA, Congress, industry and the public on what areas
pose the greatest risks and where government resources should be
directed.
   ``Are we spending all our money on the right things?'' Reilly
asked. Too often in the area of environmental protection, the
government has not, he suggested.
   ``As we gear up to deal with the environmental problems of the
1990s and beyond, I think the time has come to start taking aim
before we open fire,'' he said.

   The two major domestic airlines
canceled more than 200 flights Thursday as a nationwide strike by
airport refuelers moved into its second day.
   Ansett Airlines spokesman Peter Young said fewer than 70 flights
were scheduled, about 30 percent of normal.
   The percentage for the busiest route, Melbourne-Sydney, was
slightly higher.
   Australian Airlines said its flights were similarly affected.
   The refuelers gave airlines dispensation to fly to and from
Tasmania because of economic problems in the island state.
   Flight cancellations left plans of an estimated 20,000 travelers
in doubt. Bus and train bookings were heavy.
   The refuelers struck at midnight Tuesday in a manning dispute.

<TEXT>
   A special agriculture assistance program was
unveiled Wednesday following the latest demonstration by farmers
protesting low-priced meat imports and other issues.
   The centerpiece of the package is a $270 million fund to assist
farmers in debt because of foreign competition or the prolonged
drought in France.
   Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet also said special protection
would granted to farmers above age 55 to ensure they are not put
out of business for non-payment of debts.
   Earlier Wednesday, riot police used tear gas to drive back about
500 sheep farmers throwing eggs, tomatoes and bottles outside a
fairgrounds where Premier Michel Rocard was to address a
communications forum.
   About 1,000 police officers blocked protesters from entering the
grounds in the south-central town of Valence. Some farmers tried to
drive tractors through the barriers. Others set fire to tires to
block the entrance to a local government building.
   Rocard, who flew into the fairgrounds by helicopter, said in his
speech that protesters give themselves a bad image and complicate
efforts to aid their industry.
   In recent weeks, angry French farmers have staged dozens of
demonstrations nationwide and hijacked livestock trucks carrying
imported animals. Hundreds of cows and sheep have been killed and,
in some cases, burned alive.

   ``Highway department employees were picking up newspapers that
had been dropped by a truck. In the process, one of the workers was
resting, sitting on the guardrail in the median,'' said Peck.
   Purcell heard a crack and a whiz, and was knocked off the guard

belt, Peck said.
   Purcell didn't require medical treatment, police said.
   No arrests have been made.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury investigating a failed
credit union concluded Wednesday that stories of sexual abuse and
drug trafficking that arose after the credit union closed were
unfounded.
   The grand jury returned two indictments and said in its report
that it found evidence of obstruction of justice in its
investigation of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union.
   Shortly after Franklin failed in November 1988, allegations were
circulated about sexual abuse of children and drug abuse among
prominent Omaha residents.
   The grand jury report said it didn't find any credible evidence
that any prominent individuals in Omaha were involved in ``any ring
of organized activity to sexually exploit minors, transport minors
in interstate commerce for sexual purposes, or to traffic in
controlled substances.''
   ``Hopefully, this will place to rest the concerns and the rumors
that have been circulating in our community this past year,'' said
U.S. District Judge Lyle Strom, who dismissed the grand jury.
   Indicted were Alisha Owen, 22, who testified that she was
sexually abused as a minor, and Sandra Rhode Prucha of Omaha,
former assistant to the manager and treasurer of the Franklin
Community Federal Credit Union.
   Ms. Owen, who was indicted ealier on perjury charges by a
county grand jury, was charged with eight counts of lying to the
federal grand jury. Ms. Prucha was accused of one count of bank
fraud.
   The grand jury is the same one that issued indictments last year
against Lawrence E. King Jr., former manager of Franklin. King is
awaiting trial in U.S. District Court on 40 counts charging
conspiracy, fraud and filing false tax returns in connection with
the November 1988 failure of Franklin.
   King's wife, Alice, is charged with 12 counts of conspiracy and
fraud.
   The National Credit Union Administration also has filed lawsuits
against the Kings seeking to recover some of the $39 million it
says was missing from the credit union.
   The federal grand jury spent 24 months investigating the credit
union's failure.
   Its report said it found evidence to believe there had been an
obstruction of justice but not enough to charge anyone but Ms.
Owen. The federal grand jury indicted Ms. Owen for statements she
made to the federal grand jury in June.
   In July, a Douglas County grand jury indicted Ms. Owen on eight
counts of perjury for testimony she gave to the grand jury in the
state court system.
   The Douglas County grand jury had said a story of sexual abuse
and prostitution told to a legislative committee was ``a carefully
crafted hoax.''
   The bank fraud charge against Ms. Prucha, 47, alleges that she
used expense vouchers to obtain cash and credit, then used the cash
and credit for her personal use, Lahners said. The indictment
alleges that about $29,000 was involved, he said.

   A man armed with a high-powered rifle
stalked his wife inside a fast-food restaurant Wednesday, trapping
the woman and 12 workers for more than three hours before killing
himself, police said.
   The hostages, including a pregnant employee, left the restaurant
basement unharmed after police fired tear gas.
   ``It is our belief at that time that the gunman took his own
life,'' said Ken Robertson of the Hamilton-Wentworth police.
   The gunman's name was not immediately released by authorities.
   The incident began about 12:20 p.m. EDT when the man fired
several shots at his wife outside a McDonald's restaurant in a
southern section of Hamilton, about 30 miles southwest of Toronto.
   The woman ran into the restaurant, followed by her husband.
   ``Needless to say, pandemonium broke loose,'' Robertson said.
   Patrons and about 30 employees ran from the restaurant after the
gunman entered.
   Police said the wife and employees hid in sections of the
restaurant's basement, which houses regional offices of McDonald's.
The gunman tried unsuccessfully to find his wife among the locked
offices.
   ``He kept saying `Where is she? Where is she?''' said Trish
Obermeyer, one of those in the basement. ``And then he left us
because she wasn't there. He really didn't want anything to do with
us.''
   Police reached some of those trapped inside by telephone,
telling them to leave through a side door after tear gas canisters
were fired. Police cordoned off a half-mile area around the
restaurant.
   It was the second hostage incident at a McDonald's this week.
   On Monday, a gunman believed to have robbed a clothing store
held 19 hostages for seven hours in La Verne, Calif. The alleged
gunman was arrested and no one was injured.

   A devilish real estate market has homeowners
trying an age-old religious custom - they're burying statues of St.
Joseph.
   That's what purveyors of religious goods believe, and they say
sales prove it.
   ``I can't keep them in stock and the importers can't get them
fast enough,'' said James Borger, owner of J&amp;H Church and Religious
Goods of Bellmore on New York's Long Island.
   ``People are a little bit embarrassed to admit that's what
they're doing, but that is what they're doing,'' said Borger, who
queries his customers.
   St. Joseph, husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus, has long been
looked upon as the patron saint of families, said Rev. James Coen,
of the Catholic Information Center in Washington.
   Joseph's presence in the real estate market dates back centuries
when a group of European nuns looking for property to build
convents would place a medal of St. Joseph on prime land and ask
the saint to intercede.
   Legend says it worked.
   ``I don't know who's pushing the story these days, but I know
there's been an increase'' in sales, said Will Comellas, manager of
the Alba-Cornerstone religious gift shop in Manhattan.
   Practioners aren't not all Catholic, either.
   ``A couple of months back I had a man from the Jewish faith come
in, he said it was worth a try,'' Borger said.

<HEAD>Police Officers Reportedly Targeted in Investigation of 43
Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force investigating the slayings of 43
women in San Diego County is targeting six current and former
police officers, two newspapers reported Wednesday.
   The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force is investigating officers
who may have associated with slain prostitute Donna Gentile or her
missing friend Cynthia Maine, the Los Angeles Times and The San
Diego Union said.
   Gentile and Maine both were prostitutes and police informants,
had served time in jail and were romantically involved with at
least one member of the San Diego police force, the newspapers
reported.
   Gentile was found slain in 1985, shortly after she testified
against two police officers. Maine disappeared in early 1986, three
months after gaining early release from jail by agreeing to provide
information on several officers, the newspapers reported.
   ``The task force is trying to find out where (Maine) is, but
they believe she's dead,'' a source told the Times. ``They are
thinking it's more than a coincidence that these six officers had
some involvement with one prostitute who is dead and one who is
missing.''
   Surveillance has been conducted on several officers and
authorities eventually expect to talk to them to determine if they
are linked to some of the killings of 43 women, mostly prostitutes,
whose bodies have been found in remote parts of San Diego County
since 1985, the Union said.
   Investigators have said they believe some, but not all, of the
slayings may have been committed by the same person.
   The only person arrested so far in any of the cases is Alan
Michael Stevens, 48, a Southern California drifter charged in the
1988 death of Cynthia McVey. His trial is set to begin Monday.
   Task force spokeswoman Bonnie Dumanis confirmed the Maine
investigation but wouldn't elaborate.
   ``We are talking to anyone who has known or been associated with
Cynthia Maine, but I wouldn't say we're investigating anyone in
particular,'' Dumanis said Wednesday.
   Gentile was killed shortly after she testified before a city
Civil Service Commission about police misconduct. She was found
with rocks packed in her mouth, suggesting to detectives that she
was killed because of her testimony.
   Maine, the daughter of a former San Diego police officer, was
sent to jail in September 1985 for writing bad checks. While there,
she agreed to provide information against several police officers
in exchange for early release, said Maine's sister, Lori Helle.
   She was released from jail in November 1985 and disappeared
three months later.
   Maine's mother, Lynda Coleman, said her daughter worked
undercover for police at Solar Turbines Inc. in drug
investigations.

   President Bush asked Congress on Wednesday for
a streamlined process to negotiate a free-trade agreement with
Mexico, the nation's third-largest trading partner.
   The agreement would be aimed at removing tariffs, quotas and
other trade barriers between Mexico and the United States. A
free-trade treaty already is in force between the United States and
Canada.
   Canada also has asked to participate in the U.S. negotiations
with Mexico to achieve a trade treaty applying to all three
countries. Bush said the administration would explore the
possibility of a three-nation accord and inform Congress of his
recommendations.
   In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and
Means Committee, Bush formally notified lawmakers of his intention
to open trade talks with Mexico.
   He said that Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has
undertaken ``dynamic, market-oriented reforms.''
   ``We see substantial opportunities for mutual benefit in further
lowering impediments to bilateral trade in goods and services and
to investment,'' the president said.
   The notification gives Congress 60 legislative days to decide
whether or not to deny Bush's request for so-called ``fast-track'
negotiating authority. Because of the congressional calendar, the
60-day period should run out sometime next spring.
   If the fast-track process is authorized, the United States would
begin negotiations under rules that would prevent the Senate from
being able to amend any treaty that results.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who chairs the Finance Committee,
signalled a certain reluctance to embrace the fast-track,
no-amendment process.
   ``Never before have we negotiated a free-trade agreement with a
country so different from us economically,'' he said.
   Bush said that if the United States decides to expand the talks
with Mexico into a three-nation negotiating process, it would not
affect the validity of the trade agreement with Canada.
   Last year, the United States exported $24.97 billion in goods to
Mexico and received $27.19 in imports, for a deficit of $2.2
billion. Mexico has the world's eighth largest oil reserves, and a
free-trade pact with the United States could spur oil production.

   Carnegie Hall opened its centennial season
Wednesday with the same piece of music that opened the very first
concert in the hall on May 5, 1891.
   Beethoven's ``Leonore Overture No. 3'' was performed expertly
and with restraint by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by
its former music director, Andre Previn. The off-stage horn was
crisp and the flute soloist was excellent.
   Carnegie Hall is celebrating its 100th anniversary for the next
seven months, ending with a May 5 concert by various soloists and
the New York Philharmonic. That will fulfilling the wish of
Carnegie's executive director Judith Arron that American orchestras
open and close the season.
   Before Wednesday night's program began, a fanfare brought the
audience into the hall and the Los Angeles Philharmonic played a
pre-concert ``Star-Spangled Banner'' in Arturo Toscanini's
orchestration.
   After the ``Leonore,'' the orchestra played two pieces by
Americans, written some half century after Carnegie Hall opened but
not avant-garde.
   Itzhak Perlman was soloist in Barber's 1939 ``Concerto for
Violin and Orchestra.'' Hearing this piece, melodic and attactive
to the ear, makes one wonder why it isn't programmed more often.
Lush violins are saved from sounding like movie music by the good
taste of the melodies. Perlman's tone went from silver, shimmering
like leaves in an aspen grove, to warmly mellow.
   The second movement had an elegant pastoral melody played by
solo oboe. In the pizzicato of the third, Perlman swung his
shoulders in time to what he was playing. Some parts of the third
movement had fast Russian rhythms.
   After intermission, Schuman's ``Symphony No. 3'' from 1941 was
played. When it finished, William Schuman, who was 80 in August and
has been composing for 50 years, took a bow from a box.
   Coming right after the Barber piece, which seems to flow
naturally, the symphony's changes of mood seem to lack coherence.
But it gave the brass and percussion their chance during the
evening to be loud and even for the violins to be robust.
   It was a big-finish, half-hour fanfare to Carnegie Hall's
centennial season.
   The audience, many of whom had bought $1,000 tickets and were
continuing on to a dinner dance at the Metropolitan Club, gave the
opening night concert a standing ovation.

   Gov. George Sinner's radar detector, which
he jokingly called a ``family heirloom'' after it brought him
public derision, was sold for $200 Wednesday night at an auction.
   Kevin Cramer, executive director of the state Republican Party,
bought the Democratic governor's fuzzbuster at the North Dakota
Mental Health Association's annual fund-raising auction at a
Bismarck hotel.
   Last week, Republican state Sens. Bryce Streibel and L.L.
``Pete'' Naaden, who often criticize Sinner, complained about the
radar detector, although they are legal in North Dakota. They hired
a photographer to take a picture of it in Sinner's pickup truck.
   They pointed out that the governor had called on truckers to
alert police to speeders.
   At first Sinner shrugged off the flap, calling the detector
``sort of a sacred, emotional thing'' that had sentimental value as
a gift from his children.
   But he changed his mind Tuesday amid a welter of publicity. Time
magazine listed Sinner's statement as its ``excuse of the week.''
   ``It grieves me greatly to part with this priceless family
heirloom,'' Sinner said, ``but I'm willing to make this sacrifice
in the interest of promoting mental tranquility for Bryce Streibel
and Pete Naaden.''
   Sinner is gaining experience with auctions, Streibel said,
recalling the governor's March sale of his official Lincoln Town
Car as a symbol of his willingness to cut state spending.
   ``When is the governor's residence going on the block?''
Streibel asked. ``I think that's next.''
   Cramer said he said he isn't sure what to do with the device,
but he promised he won't use it to evade police radar.

<HEAD>Owner Sentenced to 37 Months in Offshore Sinking of Lobster Boat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fishing company owner was sentenced
Wednesday to 37 months in prison and ordered to repay $295,000 to
an insurance company for masterminding the sinking of one of his
lobster boats 80 miles out at sea.
   James P. Garbo and his company, Garbo Enterprises, also were
fined $10,000 each for the 1988 sinking of the Sophie G, a 72-foot
steel-hulled boat Garbo had tried unsuccessfully to sell. All four
men aboard the boat were rescued.
   ``This was a foul crime,'' said U.S. District Judge Jose A.
Cabranes. ``No one should doubt the seriousness of this offense,
nor the bad character that was at the root of it.''
   Garbo, 35, of North Stonington, was convicted June 15 of
conspiracy, mail fraud and destruction of a vessel.
   He sniffled and wiped away tears as his mother - for whom the
sunken boat was named - tearfully asked Cabranes for leniency.
   ``He's been a devoted son all his life,'' Sophie Garbo told the
judge. ``He has a young family. Please, I beg you for leniency.''
   Garbo declined to speak on his own behalf in court and later
refused to comment as he left the courtroom.
   Garbo's lawyer, Jeremiah Donovan, asked Cabranes for leniency.
He portrayed Garbo as a hard-working, compassionate man dedicated
to his job and his family. He said that Garbo, a fisherman for 20
of his 35 years, is ``absolutely financially ruined.''
   ``We're not talking about somebody who had every advantage in
life,'' Donovan said. ``This is not a case of white-collar crime.
Rather, it's a case of yellow-slicker crime.
   ``What happened here was terrifically out of character,''
Donovan said, adding that Garbo used ``absolutely awful bad
judgment.''
   Garbo faced a maximum of 35 years in prison and fines of up to
$2.7 million. Using federal guidelines, Cabranes sentenced Garbo to
37 months.
   He also ordered Garbo or his company to repay the $270,000
insurance policy he collected from United States Fire Insurance
Co., as well as $25,000 in other costs the insurance company
incurred.
   Garbo was ordered to surrender Dec. 3 and begin serving his
sentence at a minimum-security federal prison camp.
   The Sophie G sank in calm seas Dec. 30, 1988, in the Atlantic
Ocean 80 miles south of Shinnecock, N.Y. The captain of the ship,
Ronald Pont, of Stonington, testified that he sank the boat at
Garbo's request. Pont has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
destruction of a vessel and is to be sentenced Oct. 11.
   Garbo claimed during the trial that Pont had sunk the boat on
his own and then tried to blackmail him. But a former captain of
another Garbo boat testified that Garbo had offered him $10,000 to
sink that vessel. Garbo insisted the offer was made only in jest.
   Another Garbo boat, the Heidi Marie, was lost in the Atlantic in
November during stormy weather. All five crewmen were lost. The
government has said it does not suspect foul play, but relatives of
the dead fishermen have filed negligence lawsuits against Garbo.

   Iraq's ambassador has called ``an act of
war'' the U.N. vot  extending to the air the embargo on trade with
his country, a slap whose sting was backed by damning speeches in
the General Assembly.
   Thirteen of the Security Council's 15 members were represented
by foreign ministers during a near unanimous vote Tuesday to give
the resolution added symbolic weight.
   The council warned the Baghdad government of further punitive
action and hinted at sanctions against nations that fail to honor
the U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq. Cuba cast the only no vote.
   In addition to sanctioning the air embargo, the resolution
called for halting Iraqi shipping and freezing Iraqi assets
overseas.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gay and Arab. They are two words rarely spoken
in the same breath, and almost never in the conservative Middle
East, but Ramzi Zakharia hopes to change that.
   A year ago, Zakharia founded the Gay and Lesbian Arabic Society
and discovered other Arab-Americans in the homosexual community who
wanted to define a distinct gay Arabic identity.
   ``The result was very positive. A lot of people wrote, `Well,
it's about time,''' Zakharia says.
   Zakharia rented a post office box, started a newsletter and
began to hold monthly meetings at people's houses around
Washington. Today, there are chapters in San Francisco, Detroit,
Los Angeles and New York, as well as a scattering of contacts in
Middle Eastern countries, including Lebanon, Morocco, Egypt and
Yemen.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) - A high school dropout's dream of putting to use
his new college diploma was shattered by a random gang attack. A
girl's ninth birthday ended with a stray bullet as she lay on her
mother's bed.
   From New York to Chicago to Milwaukee, big cities are seeking
emergency gun control measures as they battle a dramatic rise in
violent crimes, many involving random killings of innocent victims.
   ``It doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing, the
lives of people in the inner city ... are at stake,'' said
anti-crime activist Ruth Varnado, whose Reclaiming the Streets
movement has won praise from President Bush.
   Milwaukee, a city of 600,000, has seen its murder rate jump by
more than half to 18.7 per 100,000 residents between 1988 and 1989.
That translated into a record 116 homicides in 1989. Already this
year, 115 killings have been recorded. A decade ago, there were
fewer than 100 homicides in all of Wisconsin.

   HOUSTON (AP) - Sales of guns and burglary alarms have picked up
in the nation's fourth-largest city since the courts ordered the
release of more than 270 inmates to relieve overcrowding at the
Harris County Jail.
   All the freed inmates had been jailed on misdemeanors. But for
some Houston-area residents, that's no more reassuring than hearing
Houston trails Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and Detroit in
crime.
   At least 31 of the 276 inmates freed on personal recognizance
bond since Sept. 14 are already back behind bars, police said.
Seven have been charged with felonies, including armed robbery in
one case, police said.
   ``We're just arresting the same people. We're letting them out
and arresting them again,'' said Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen. ``The
citizens of Harris County have again been victimized by the
system.''

<HEAD>Serbians Strive to Hold onto Kosovo Heartland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The playground at Vladimir Ilyich
Lenin elementary school was quiet as classes began this year. A few
Serbian boys kicked a scuffed soccer ball while ethnic Albanians
huddled around schedules posted on the wall.
   The mood was ominous. The kids didn't mix.
   The school, in Pristina's high-rise Dardania suburb, is split by
the bitterest of Yugoslavia's many ethnic disputes. The division
between Serb and Albanian touches everything in Pristina and the
surrounding Kosovo province, and appears irreparable.
   ``Tensions are rising very fast and our Serb colleagues and
ourselves, well, we don't even say `hi' anymore,'' said Sefia
Hassani, a young ethnic Albanian who teaches English.
   Serbia's Communist leadership appears ready at all costs to hold
onto the southern province that it administers and Serbs revere as
the sacred heartland of their medieval empire.
   The Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
people, are demanding political autonomy.
   ``In all of Eastern Europe, Stalinism is dead or dying - here
it's having a renaissance,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, an Albanian who
heads the Kosovo Democratic Union, a political party recently
legalized by Yugoslavia's federal government.
   ``We are trying to find a peaceful solution but the Serb
government isn't ready to negotiate, it just uses repression,'' he
charged.
   Relations between the two ethnic groups in Yugoslavia's poorest
province have been deteriorating for more than a decade.
   Serbs brand Albanians murderers and rapists. They say more than
220,000 Serbs have been chased off their land since 1966.
   More than 60 ethnic Albanians have died in Kosovo in occasional
clashes with police the last 18 months. Albanian leaders say more
than 600,000 have been investigated for ``politicial crimes'' since
1981.
   When Kosovo's parliament unilaterally declared the province
sovereign on July 2, Serbian authorities in Belgrade promptly
dissolved the assembly, closed Albanian-language media, fired about
15,000 ethnic Albanian workers and took control of police and local
administration.
   Albanian leaders called a one-day general strike Sept. 3, the
day before school started, paralyzing shops and factories.
Authorities threatened to fire strikers, and locked managers and
workers out of their stores when they returned.
   Belgrade television also announced a group of outlawed Kosovo
deputies from the dissolved parliament was detained Sept. 7 for
meeting secretly and declaring the province Yugoslavia's seventh
republic.
   ``Serbia cannot stand by and watch someone declare the secession
of (Serbia's) territory. To protect it, we are prepared to use all
legal means,'' said Momcilo Trajkovic, Serbia's deputy premier and
Kosovo governor.
   He said dissolution of parliament and the takeover of Pristina's
media prevented open war in Kosovo, because ``no leadership in
Serbia could have convinced the Serb nation not to fight for their
territory.''
   But in nearly a month since then, four more ethnic Albanians
have been killed in two incidents, two in a shootout with Serb
police that raided the village of Palatna north of Pristina in
search of arms, and two others after allegedly firing at police at
a roadblock.
   This emotional conflict is rooted deep in history. Kosovo Polje,
or the field of blackbirds, was the site of a bloody battle in 1389
that pitted the Orthodox Serb Empire and its Christian allies
against Ottoman Turks.
   Nowadays Serbs accuse Moslem Albanians of nationalism tinged
with Islamic fundamentalism, separatism, and plotting to merge
Kosovo with neighboring Albania.
   ``Serbia is currently an irrational regime, it is reacting like
a wounded beast - it knows it's dying but it won't die without a
fight,'' said Veton Surroi, a prominent Albanian leader.
   Nationalism is running high in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic with more than 9 million people. Radio, television and
Politika, the once-respected Belgrade daily, now toe the hard-line
of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
   General elections in Serbia are expected by early next year. But
Western observers say Milosevic's Communists, now renamed the
Socialists, likely will win and continue to avoid democratic reform
if they can play on Serbs' nationalist fears.
   Croatia and Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most Western-oriented
republics where center-right governments have already replaced
Communists, are worried that the Kosovo crackdown will drag
Yugoslavia into international isolation as the West makes economic
aid increasingly dependent on democracy and human rights.
   ``Unless they get rid of the Kosovo problem, Yugoslavia can't
hope for any major international aid coming in,'' said one Western
diplomat in Belgrade.
   According to Rugova, ``Only economic sanctions and diplomatic
pressure from abroad can change Serbian policy on Kosovo.''
   That pressure is mounting. A delegation of U.S. congressmen
headed by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., visited Pristina in August and
said it was disturbed by ``fresh evidence that the Serbian
authorities are engaged in a systematic pattern of violating the
human rights of Albanians.''
   But the Serbian government, though strapped for capital as
Yugoslavia tackles the painful transition to free-market economics,
is defiant in the face of growing Western criticism.
   ``Even if we are subjected to economic sanctions, we will not
give up striving for our territorial integrity,'' said Trajkovic.
   In addition to firing Albanians from state-controlled jobs, Serb
authorities are also trying to resettle Kosovo with Serbs from
other parts of Yugoslavia.
   They plan to introduce a Serbian school curriculum in the
province that will replace teaching of Albanian history and
literature with Serbian classes.

<HEAD>Long-Insular Mormons Edge Into Interfaith Cooperation</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mormons, who generally have kept aloof from other Christian
communities, are gradually - and in expanding ways - moving into
working association with them.
   To some extent, the past shunning has been mutual. Steps toward
alleviating it represent a quiet mending of a rupture in America's
social-religious fabric.
   For most of its 160 years, the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (Mormon) has avoided links with the other
religious groups, which, in turn, have kept a cold shoulder toward
Mormons.
   But on both sides, leaders are showing a growing impulse for
contacts and efforts toward better understanding and are increasing
moves for cooperation, although some distrust lingers and some
people oppose the trend alltogether.
   ``Some Mormons don't want it,'' said Mormon theologian Roger R.
Keller of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. ``Some of the
others are suspicious of Mormons. But we've begun to break through
the shell of isolation.''
   As misconceptions and scurrilous notions about each other are
diminished, ``more interchange becomes possible,'' he said. ``I
hope we are standing at the crossroads of genuine dialogue.''
   Such dialogue has flourished for years among Protestant, Roman
Catholic, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish groups, reducing
old prejudices and distortions about one another.
   But Mormons, who were denounced, persecuted and driven westward
in their early years, generally had stayed apart from that
inter-religious companionship and teamwork until recently.
   Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the church's ruling Council of 12,
said the change is toward working together ``on matters of common
interest'' and the church now is involved in several such projects.
   ``I think the outlook for our being involved with others is
good,'' he said. ``And I think other groups need us, and we need
other groups.''
   Oaks, a former law professor, president of Brigham Young
University and Utah Supreme Court justice, said that
``traditionally our church has been very distant from other
churches.''
   Considering the past persecutions of Mormons, he added, ``It is
is easy to understand why the Latter-day Saints' relationship with
other faiths has been a strained and suspicious one.''
   But as the American-born denomination has grown - now totaling 4
million U.S. members and 7 million worldwide - it has entered into
several interfaith ventures in the last decade.
   ``We are more mature as a church,'' Oaks said. ``We feel less
threatened by others. We're willing to forget some old persecutions
and some old history and meet people on the basis of mutual respect
and mature self-interest.''
   Among such recent moves by Mormons was their joining in 1988
with 22 faith groups - Protestant, Catholic and Jewish - in the
National Interfaith Cable Coalition, producing religious and
values-oriented programs on the VISN television network.
   In 1986, Mormons became part of the Religious Alliance Against
Pornography, a wide ecumenical cross-section. In 1984, they
affiliated with Religion in American Life, involving most major
U.S. denominations in seeking to stimulate weekly worship.
   Also in the mid-'80s, Mormons entered into inter-religious
relief work, including aid to the homeless. They contributed about
$5 million to relief efforts in famine-ravaged central Africa, much
of it through Catholic Relief Services and the American Red Cross.
   Oaks, as a former educator, had experienced ecumenical
cooperation in the Association of Presidents of Independent
Colleges and Universities in the 1970s, and has since encouraged
that trend in the church.
   So far, such connections have been on non-doctrinal matters, and
Oaks emphasized that the church disapproves any discussions aimed
at changing doctrines.
   That, however, isn't the aim of inter-church doctrinal talks. It
is, rather, to explain their concepts to each other, to overcome
misperceptions of one another and to achieve fuller mutual
understanding.
   ``It is not only enriching, but develops one's own Christian
understanding,'' said Keller, a former Presbyterian minister turned
Mormon, with advanced degrees from Princeton Theological Seminary
and Duke University.
   ``There needs to be more forums for conversations,'' he said.
While differing on some points and without seeking to change or
convert one another, benefits come in ``just getting to know and
appreciate one another,'' he said.
   Mormons hold some distinctive beliefs, but like other
Christians, they regard the Bible as holy scripture, honor Christ
as God's divine son, uphold his teachings and believe in salvation
through his atoning death and resurrection.
   Through candid dialogue, participants learn from each other,
Keller said. ``Out of the depth of spirituality, I can learn so
much from my Protestant and Catholic brothers and sisters. We need
to sit down in front of the fireplace with a hot cup of cider and
talk,'' he said.
   ``I really believe God guides his children to truth, as the
spirit works in them, and hearts are opened up. The only way to
know it happens is people of faith sharing with each other from the
deepest recesses of their souls.''

   Ron Kottemann's days are measured in
hoofbeats and 12-inch lengths of taffy. His wages are quarters,
paid out mainly from small, sweaty palms. His shop is a four-foot
by six-foot swaying box perched on high wooden wheels.
   ``There's no better way to make a living in the world. They can
keep all their desk jobs,'' said the Roman Candy man.
   In the narrow wooden wagon drawn by Rosie the mule, Kottemann
makes and sells the hand-pulled Italian taffy just as he
grandfather did. While Rosie tows him through the streets of New
Orleans, he boils up the sweet, yellow globs, adds vanilla,
strawberry or chocolate, then kneads and pulls it into glistening,
sticky rope.
   ``My grandfather started this. In those days, everybody had a
wagon. It wasn't a big deal. You'd see all sorts of wagons going
around town with people selling stuff. The world changed, but we
didn't,'' said Kottemann, 41.
   Well, some changes, but only small ones. The price has gone up.
Roman Candy sticks that sold for a nickel when Sam Cortese started
making them in 1915 now go for a quarter.
   Kottemann has also added a second wagon that is permanently
stationed at the Audubon Zoo and he sells to about 20 stores
wholesale.
   ``People tell me I should modernize,'' Kottemann said. ``They
say I should get rid of Rosie and the wagon and get a truck. But if
I did that it would become a two-man operation. I'd need someone to
drive and someone to make the candy. This way, Rosie drives and I
make the candy. She responds to voice commands, so I hardly ever
have to even touch the reins. We're the perfect team.''
   Kottemann takes Rosie from her stable behind his uptown New
Orleans home around 9 a.m. and goes to work.
   ``Usually five days. Sometimes six, once in a while seven if I
need the money. I try not to work on Sundays and almost never on
Monday. That's a real dead day for business,'' he said.
   He stops for business in various parts of town each morning -
downtown some days, outside the parks on others, occasionally in
the French Quarter.
   ``I like to go into the Quarter, but only if there are a lot of
local folks there. The tourists think the wagon is cute and they
take a lot of pictures, but they don't know what Roman Candy is and
they don't usually buy. Lots of smiling, not many sales, that's the
tourist trade for me,'' he said.
   He changes locations in the afternoon. Every day, during the
school year, he sets up outside a school before the closing bell.
   ``Things started changing about 10 years ago,'' Kottemann said.
``I used to spend most of the days just driving through different
neighborhoods. It used to be that Mama was home with the kids. Now
Mama and Dad are both at work and the kids are in day care. I can
drive through a neighborhood now and not see a soul before 4 or 5
o'clock.''
   Kottemann started working on the Roman Candy wagon with his
grandfather when he was in the eighth grade. By the time he went to
college and then to the Army, he knew he wanted to carry on the
business.
   Cortese died in 1969, as Kottemann entered the service. The
candy wagon was off the street for three years, the only shutdown
in 75 years. When Kottemann was discharged, the wagon began to make
its rounds again.
   He sells an average of 600 sticks of candy a day, and with his
zoo wagon and his store accounts, Kottemann said he makes a good
living for his family: ``It probably wouldn't support a big group,
but it's plenty for us.''
   The future? At this point, Kottemann's not sure.
   Crime is his biggest concern. Kottemann said he's not worried
about his candy wagon being robbed; he's afraid it will get so
dangerous to live in town that he may have to move.
   ``That would really hurt. As it is now Rosie's stable is right
in the back yard. It's been there for 100 years. I just unhitch
her, feed her and go in the house. If we move and she's stabled
somewhere else, that means I'd have to go there on my days off to
take care of her. It would mean commuting back and forth. It would
really change things,'' he said.
   It's a faroff worry, however. For now, and for the foreseeable
future, it'll be business as usual at the Roman Candy wagon.
   ``I make a good living, and if I want to take off and go to my
son's little league game or anything else, I just do it. How many
executives do you know who can say that?''

   A decade of noisy construction in
downtown Hartford has given way to eerie silence.
   In one five-day period, Hartford ranked near the bottom of a
national survey of economic growth in urban areas, a once-popular
restaurant across the street from City Hall unexpectedly shut down
permanently, and, in an emotional blow to the entire downtown,
Sage-Allen &amp; Co. announced plans to close its 101-year-old
department store on Main Street.
   ``I was devastated,'' Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry said of the
Sage-Allen closing. ``I said `Wow!' ... It's the end of an era.''
   And there have been other setbacks. Two of Hartford's largest
downtown hotels shut down completely, taking 40 percent of the
city's hotel rooms with them. And West Hartford-based Colonial
Realty Co., which owns several of the city's biggest office towers,
was forced into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   At one point, things got so bad that a group of merchants held a
press conference downtown to announce that, contrary to rumors,
they were staying open.
   Business owners and city officials can take some comfort in
knowing that other large cities in Connecticut - and across New
England - are experiencing similar downturns in construction and
retail activity.
   But in Hartford, where civic groups have struggled for years to
coax people into a central business district dominated by insurance
giants like Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and The Travelers, the economic
slump has brought on a bout of civic soul-searching.
   ``Right now, we have lost the soul of the city,'' said Brad
Davis, a radio talk show host who has worked in the city for three
decades.
   ``The only thing that's going to save the city is to bring back
its soul,'' he said. ``People have got to be shown that we have an
identity. We're not Boston, and we're not New York. But we've got
our own identity.''
   Hartford, a city of 130,000 and the hub of a metropolitan area
of 750,000 people, faces the same problems as many other U.S.
cities - the flight of whites and the middle class to the suburbs,
the perception of high crime, parking and transportation.
   Efforts to revive downtown have met with some success. Union
Place, a glitzy corridor of nightclubs and restaurants near the
city's renovated railroad station, is packed with young people
several nights a week.
   A new retail row has sprouted on Pratt Street, an intimate side
street in the center of the city.
   And several civic groups are dedicated to breathing new life
into downtown. ``When things get a little tougher, you have to pull
together,'' said Tana Parseliti, whose family has run Frank's
restaurant in the heart of downtown for 46 years.
   Still, on many nights, downtown restaurants scramble for
business after office workers desert the area. Few people live in
the city's center. The district's only hardware store closed
recently, and there hasn't been a movie theater downtown in years.
   The corporations that dominate Hartford's downtown exist almost
as self-contained communities, complete with their own cafeterias,
health clubs and coffee shops, and connected by skywalks.
   ``A person can come in off the highway, go into one of these
corporations, and never come out until they leave town,'' said
Perry.
   ``We need a mixed city. We don't just need businesses and the
poor. And that's a national struggle for cities. It's not just a
Hartford struggle.''
   Buoyed by the growth of its large corporations, Hartford, the
state's capital, boomed in the 1980s. High-rises sprouted - and
sprouted; a developer announced plans to build the tallest building
in New England, a skyscraper stretching 888 feet, 8 inches.
   But when the region's economy slumped, downtown office vacancy
rates soared and the building stopped, leaving the city pockmarked
by vacant lots.
   After a protracted struggle against conservationists, developers
destroyed the city's first skyscraper, the 77-year-old Hartford
Aetna building, this spring to make room for a 45-story bank tower.
   But construction of the new tower has been delayed, and the site
now is marked by a giant crater, idle construction equipment and
several boarded-up storefronts.
   At the other end of Asylum Street, the glass-and-steel Parkview
Hilton that symbolized the new look of Hartford in the 1950s has
been shut down since New Year's Eve. Unable to find a buyer, the
hotel's owners scheduled an auction in early June, but then decided
to raze the building to make room for what they hope will be an
office tower.
   Hanging over the city's economic uncertainty are fears that
United Technologies Corp. may take its corporate headquarters out
of Hartford. The defense giant has announced plans to move its
headqarters, probably within the city, but has not disclosed a
final decision.
   Shortly after Sage-Allen announced it would close its downtown
store, 70-year-old Minnie Wright made a decision of her own. The
store's closing would change her shopping habits, she said. After
shopping at the downtown store for five decades, she now would take
the bus to a West Hartford mall to shop at the Sage-Allen there.
   ``All the stores are going out there,'' she said. ``Who's coming
in here?''
   She shook her head as she reminisced about downtown when it
bustled with department stores, cafeterias and five-and-dimes.
   ``It looks like it's on the way out,'' she said. ``Completely
out.''

   In the greatest assemblage of world leaders
ever gathered, the World Summit for Children meets on Sunday,
shadowed by crisis that threatens the peace and peace dividend that
seemed at hand when it was conceived.
   The leaders of more than 70 governments are to sit at one
gigantic, United Nations conference table - there are places for 74
- to talk about the world's children, their needs and what can be
done to meet them.
   Only the heads of governments can participate; no stand-ins or
deputies at the table. The summit census nearly doubles what was
the record 38 world leaders who met at the United Nations on its
40th anniversary in 1985.
   President Bush will be in New York for the Sunday summit, and is
to speak briefly. Since there are to be about 30 speeches, they are
limited to a maximum of 5 minutes each. Every orator has been
forewarned.
   ``These most powerful people in the world are getting together
to deal with the problems of the most vulnerable people in the
world,'' said Jay Ross, a spokesman for the United Nations
Children's Fund. ``That carries a message.''
   The statistic cited over and over in preparation for the summit:
every day, about 40,000 children under age 5 die of starvation or
diseases that could be prevented.
   ``It is the greatest condemnation of our times that more than a
quarter of a million small children should still be dying every
week of easily preventable illness and malnutrition,'' said James
P. Grant, the UNICEF executive director, in the 1989 annual report
that gave rise to the summit plan.
   Indeed, until Aug. 2, it seemed that the 45th General Assembly
of the United Nations, the first of the post-Cold War era, could
concentrate on that and other chronic world problems.
   Then Iraq invaded Kuwait, igniting the first major crisis of the
new era, and the U.N. became the crucial forum in the world
response to Baghdad, voting to impose a trade embargo and
authorizing the use of force if necessary to make it stick.
   Iraqi diplomats tried, futilely, to link the embargo with the
summit on children, asserting at one planning session that it would
lead to starvation of their young, and that the summit should say
so. It won't. Nor will Iraq be participating on Sunday. Saddam
Hussein had said he would send his government's health minister,
but aides were not invited to participate, only to watch.
   There were echoes of other, more familiar complaints, dating
from Cold War times as summit planners put together a ``World
Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of
Children.''
   The statement, due for ceremonial signing by the summit
participants on Sunday, lists war, aggression, and foreign
occupation among the causes of the suffering of children. A Cuban
diplomat proposed amending the statement to include colonialism as
another cause. A British aide said that it should list totalitarian
dictatorships instead. Both amendments were scrapped.
   With the ebbing of Cold War, the statement says, ``significant
resources could be released for purposes other than military
ones,'' and the needs of children should be a priority claim on
those resources.
   That's the peace dividend argument. It runs head-on into the
deficits plaguing the United States and the economic crisis
wrenching the Soviet Union.
   The summit statement also promises ``a global attack on
poverty,'' seeking more aid, trade, debt relief and economic growth
for the developing world. At this point, the industrial nations are
struggling against an economic slump of their own, worsened by the
sharp increase in oil prices because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   It urges every nation ``to reexamine its current national
budget'' and its foreign aid commitment to give priority to
programs to cut child mortality and hunger, and to make primary
education available to at least 80 percent of the world's children
by the year 2000.
   The summit declaration seeks those goals and more, acknowledging
that they are ambitious and will take extraordinary, worldwide
effort.
   In that quest, the fact that Sunday's meeting is being held may
be more important than anything said there. It puts the problems of
children on a world stage, at least for a day.
   The challenge now will be to translate one day at the summit
ino a drive that will last the decade.

<HEAD>C-Span To Celebrate 10th Year of Call-Ins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 10 years ago, C-SPAN began its first
call-in show. Alas, there was a power failure, despite the fact
that C-SPAN is in Washington, D.C., where even reporters think they
have power.
   Something went poof ``and the lights all blew, the power blew,''
C-SPAN chairman Brian Lamb recalls. Repairs were made in five
minutes, but for a while, ``it was bizarre, guerilla television.''
   On Oct. 7, C-SPAN will celebrate its 10th year of call-ins with
the same four guests - journalists on the communications beat -
discussing how today's issues in the communications industry
compared to those of 1980.
   Back then, a viewer from Yankton, S.D., was the first caller to
C-SPAN, a non-profit company originally created by the cable
television industry to provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of House
proceedings.
   Lamb doesn't recall the first caller's name. But that's
understandable. He estimates that about 100,000 viewers have dialed
in since then to grill guests or have their say on the hot issues
of the day.
   The callers he does remember range from an 11-year-old
Mississippi schoolgirl to Gary Owens, the free-spirit announcer
from the old ``Laugh-In'' series to former President Reagan, who
has called twice.
   The audience and callers - C-SPAN currently serves nearly 51
million homes in the U.S. - no longer are only Americans. That
changed in 1988.
   Now, its two 90-minute weekday call-in shows in the morning and
early evening, plus additional ones held after such events as a
presidential speech, are carried via satellite in 26 other
countries, mainly in Europe.
   Viewers there also can phone in, although only two lines are set
up for their calls, compared to eight for domestic dialers. In all
cases, each dialer foots the cost of the toll call.
   The topics discussed usually are national and international
matters, such as the federal budget, Social Security, highway
safety, legal issues and, in recent weeks, the Persian Gulf crisis
and the savings and loan mess.
   The majority of guests tend to be federal officials and House
and Senate members. When he was vice president, President Bush was
a guest. His vice president, Dan Quayle, also has been on, fielding
questions.
   It may be heresy, but Lamb says print journalists, not the
electronic kind, are the show's second-largest group of guests. His
reasoning:
   ``Television fills in a blank or two, but if you go to the
backbone of where people get their information, it's in the
newspaper.''
   Like their radio cousins, television call-in shows have become
so rampant they give common a bad name. But C-SPAN's are unique in
two regards.
   One is that they have no ``star'' hosts. The shows never say in
advance who the hosts will be. There are 10, three of them
journalists. The rest, including Lamb, are C-SPAN staffers for whom
hosting is a secondary job.
   On any given day, for example, the host could be Bruce Collins,
C-SPAN's chief attorney, or Susan Swain, its senior vice president
for programming, Lamb says.
   ``We want people to tune in for the issues and the guests
instead of the hosts,'' he says.
   As in 1980, all the calls are live. There is no seven-second
delay - a common device of call-in shows now - to let the host dump
a dialer who might fancy himself the next Andrew Dice Clay.
   ``We've always tried to make this as real as possible so that
the audience won't feel any kind of technical interference between
them and the guests,'' Lamb says.
   The show does periodically hear from those who are none too
tightly wrapped, he says, ``but that is not the norm by any stretch
of the imagination.'' But, he concedes, ``If the moon is full - and
this is not an exaggeration - you can have a very unusual
program.''
   It is the nature of life that hosts of television talk shows
often are guests on other television talk shows. Phil Donahue does
it all the time.
   Although Lamb is a no-name, relatively speaking, as a call-in
show host, he, too, has been a guest, twice, on a national
television call-in show - Larry King's show on the Cable News
Network.
   Each visit induced high anxiety, he says: ``It's much easier
being a host than a guest. You're in control when you're the host.
When you're the guest, you're totally at the mercy of the host.
   ``So I have a great appreciation for how we can screw things
up.''

   CABLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Robert Wussler, who once headed CBS-TV,
then was a top executive for cable maestro Ted Turner, thinks there
could be megabucks when and if Hollywood decides to air hit movies
on pay-per-view cable while the films still are in theaters.
   Wussler, president of Comsat Video Enterprises, told a cable
industry lunch here this week that he thinks this may happen in
1995 or 1996. One hot picture, he predicted, ``in one night will
gross $100 million'' from a pay-per-view showing.

<HEAD>`America's First Superhighway' Turns 50</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania Turnpike's goal when it
opened 50 years ago was to provide a fast way over and through the
Appalachian Mountains. What it gave America was a faster way to the
future.
   The 160-mile, four-lane ribbon of concrete became the precursor
of the United States' interstate highway system, conquering
2,800-foot hills with slopes, wide lanes, rest areas and exit ramps
that became the standard for today's superhighways. It opened Oct.
1, 1940.
   ``When the federal government was developing the interstate
system, they had us as an example,'' said Neal Wood, chief bridge
engineer on the highway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's
unofficial historian.
   ``When we had a good design, they used it. When one was bad,
they changed it,'' Wood said.
   The turnpike was, and still is, an engineering marvel. The
original section snaked its way from Irwin, near Pittsburgh, to
Middlesex, near Harrisburg, through seven tunnels and across scores
of bridges.
   The road's groundwork, both literally and figuratively, had been
laid a half-century earlier by the New York Central Railroad.
William Vanderbilt started tunnel work and grading on a ``South
Penn'' route to compete with the Pennsylvania Railroad, which ran
through Altoona.
   Both railroads were convinced to ease their competition for fear
both would go out of business. ``On one telegram's notice, work was
stopped, everyone was paid off, accounts were settled and the line
was abandoned,'' Wood said.
   In the 1930s state lawmakers and lobbyists joked about erecting
a truckers' highway on old bridge pilings across the Susquehanna
River. That ``joke'' has since been recognized by the American
Society of Civil Engineers as a National Civil Engineering
Landmark.
   Highway systems to that time weren't systems at all, but roads
that meandered from town square to town square. When the original
section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was opened, it bypassed 939
cross streets, 12 railroad crossings and 25 traffic signals along
U.S. 11 and U.S. 30, the old Lincoln Highway.
   ``This became more than a way of getting across Pennsylvania. It
was a tourist attraction,'' Wood said.
   The U.S. Bureau of Public Roads had predicted only 715 cars
would travel the turnpike each day in 1940. Other government
studies predicted toll roads would never work.
   But in the highway's first four days, 6,000 cars traveled the
turnpike each day. On Oct. 6, 1940, the turnpike got its first dose
of Sunday drivers, when 27,000 clogged the artery.
   ``Attendants at three of the interchanges ran out of
passenger-car tickets and resorted to handing out light-truck
tickets or handwritten notes,'' according to a history of the
turnpike.
   Many communities had shunned turnpike workers during
construction, fearing towns would die once the highway opened. But
many prospered.
   ``When they build a bypass around a community, the economic
impact is not that great,'' said Robert Barnoff, visiting professor
of civil engineering at Bucknell University. ``What they lose in
gasoline or hamburger sales, they usually get back by attracting
industry with their better transportation system.''
   Even before the original section opened, the turnpike planned
expansion to Philadelphia and the Ohio state line. Three more
extensions opened by 1957. Currently, the turnpike commission is
building two more offshoots: to the Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport and around Greensburg. Another new section is
planned from Pittsburgh south to Morgantown, W.Va.
   With no recent toll-road precedents, early turnpike employees
had to improvise. Lee Rishel was asked to train the toll
collectors, but didn't know how much they were supposed to collect.
   ``What they did at toll bridges and tunnels was collect at the
point of entry and let people cross. There were no toll roads like
this, with eight intermediate exits, so we had to come up with a
fare schedule,'' said Rishel, 78.
   Rishel's committee determined that automobile drivers should pay
a penny per mile and that truckers should pay a little more.
   How much more was difficult to determine.
   ``At first we had a mess with the classification,'' he said.
``We classified by vehicle size, but it was a cause of complaint
among truckers because a truck hauling feathers was paying the same
as a truck hauling steel.'' In 1955, the turnpike began assessing
trucks by weight.
   In 1956, with the start of the interstate system, the turnpike's
image began to change. The highway went from being an industry
standard for excellence to a standard of how highways shouldn't be
built.
   ``There are four lanes of traffic, two in both directions, and a
narrow divider,'' Barnoff said. ``They had a lot of head-on
collisions, and at the speeds they were traveling you had some big
ones. Lots of fatalities.''
   The first speed limit, 70 mph, wasn't posted until the highway
was open 6{ months. Concrete barriers along the medial strip were
completed in 1969.
   The fatality rate on the highway now is among the lowest in the
nation among turnpikes, 0.8 per 100 million miles driven. The rate
for all rural interstates is 1.6 per 100 million miles, according
to turnpike figures.
   But cars still shine headlights across the lanes at a distance
of 10 feet. And there isn't much room for improvement.
   ``The growth that's occurred across the roadway fence makes it
difficult to convert our highway to what people are accustomed
to,'' Martin said. ``Our success has been our limitation. We've
pinned ourselves in by development.''

<HEAD>Banks Tremble Ahead of `Lost Friday' Onslaught</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tellers are gathering, clerks are stocking
deposit and withdrawal slips and security people are lengthening
the line dividers as banks brace themselves for another ``Lost
Friday.''
   More than 80 million workers who are paid weekly, biweekly and
bimonthly will get their checks on the same day - Sept. 28 - and
most will make a stampede for the bank.
   ``It's a massive problem,'' Brace Pattou, a spokesman for Harris
Bank in Chicago, said of the event, which will occur just four
times this year.
   To cope with the convergence of customers, Harris takes former
tellers who do other jobs in the bank and puts them behind the
counter. The bank also issues white carnations to lobby managers to
make them ``visible and accessible when people have problems'' or,
more likely, become impatient over the long lines, Pattou said.
   Other banks forbid tellers from taking lunch breaks during peak
noontime hours as transactions at the windows and automatic teller
machines jump as much as 50 percent.
   One way to avoid the mayhem is for employees to have their
companies deposit their paychecks directly into their bank
accounts.
   The practice is embraced by nearly all Japanese businesses and
most Europeans. But in the United States only 17 million checks are
deposited directly, according to figures from the National
Automated Clearing House Association, a Herndon, Va.-based trade
group.
   Direct deposit is safe and efficient and relieves busy workers
of a trip to the bank simply to dump money into an account. ``Why
take the risk or lose time dealing with a paycheck,'' said Elliott
McEntee, clearing house association president and chief executive.
   But corporations and banks stand to reap big benefits
themselves. The clearing house association estimates employers
could save anywhere from 10 cents to 23 cents on every paycheck
that is deposited directly.
   Furthermore, the association estimates that conservatively,
companies would increase productivity by up to $5 billion a year
because employees would no longer need to take time out to visit
their financial institutions. A recent study by the automated
clearing house trade group found the average employee spends eight
to 24 hours each year going to the bank during working hours.
   For banks, which have long been criticized for trying to keep
average customers at arms length, direct deposit would mean fewer
in-person visits to the teller window - or 60 cents saved per
deposit transaction. That could translate to tens of millions of
dollars in weekly savings for the financial institutions, according
to the association.
   Then there is the issue of float, the time between the deposit
of a check in the bank and payment. Businesses, which earn interest
until checks are cashed, will lose some of their float advantage
with direct deposit. But McEntee stresses that advantage will be
more than made up in productivity savings.
   The association has spent over $2 million in the past two years
on a marketing campaign designed to encourage direct deposit among
bank customers. McEntee plans to make a personal pitch to American
Airlines' executives this week.
   So far, the campaign has been met with reasonable success.
McEntee figures that 100,000 companies are offering direct deposit
to some or all employees, double the number three years ago.
   Still, many people are reluctant to rely on an all-electronic
pay system. ``It is clear from market research that some consumers
want a paper check,'' McEntee said.
   It provides ``a sensation of security - people think the paper
check is good, but electronic payment is more secure,'' he said.

   After more than three years of study and debate,
the way has been opened for admission of women to the Cantors
Assembly, an organization of about 400 cantors of Conservative
Jewish congregations.
   Women ``will add new voices and new strength to our
organization,'' said Cantor Samuel Rosenbaum of Rochester, N.Y.,
executive vice president of the assembly.
   Judaism's Conservative wing began ordaining women as rabbis in
1985, and its Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan began
investing women cantors in 1987. But not until this month were
assembly snags cleared to admit them.
   The Reform wing of Judaism has accepted women as cantors and
rabbis for about 15 years.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Women's Ordination Conference, which seeks
admission of women to the Roman Catholic priesthood, congratulated
American bishops on their decision to postpone indefinitely action
on a proposed pastoral letter on women.
   Alluding to criticism of the proposed letter by various women's
groups, WOC board member Andrea Johnson said she hoped its
sidelining was a sign the bishops were ``reclaiming their American
democratic roots.''

   LAKE JUNALUSKA, N.C. (AP) - On a recent visit in South Africa,
delegates of the World Methodist Council found a ``new climate of
hopefulness'' for an end to apartheid, the council's general
secretary says.
   The Rev. Joe Hale said an ``atmosphere of good will'' prevailed
in the group's discussions with President F.W. de Klerk, in
contrast to a stormy meeting in 1987 with then President P.W.
Botha.
   At the end of the 75-minute meeting, he said, de Klerk
commented: ``We are looking for a solution to South Africa's future
that will stand the Bible's test for honesty and justice.''

   GENEVA (AP) - Jane Dempsey Douglass, a theology historian at
Princeton University in the United States, has been elected
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches by the group's
executive committee.
   The first woman to head the worldwide organizaion, she replaces
the Rev. Allen Boesak of South Africa. He resigned after disclosure
of an extra-marital affair with a woman television producer.
   The alliance includes 157 Reformed, Presbyterian and

   NEW YORK (AP) - Church leaders of various denominations marked
the official publication date Sept. 27 of the New Revised Standard
Version of the Bible with a celebration of hymns, preaching and
prayer.
   The translation, a product of 15 years work by an
interdenominational committee headed by noted Bible scholar Bruce
Metzger, has been available in bookstores since May. Some
publishers have begun third printings.

   WAHINGTON (AP) - Noting the role of the United Nations in
opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, U.S. Roman Catholic bishops say
the United States should promptly pay its current and back U.N.
dues totaling $661 million.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, head of the bishops'
international policy committee, asked the Senate appropriations
subcommittee to appropriate funds to meet ``all U.S. obligations''
to the United Nations.
   Citing the United Nations' performance in the current Mideast
crisis, in recent monitoring of elections in Nicaragua and Namibia,
in mediating peace talks in El Salvador and in facilitating
withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Angola, Mahony
said:
   ``It is time for the United States to resume the cooperative
role in the U.N. it once played.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide on Medicating Prisoner To Allow Execution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Owen Perry's medicine could restore his
sanity, but it has one enormous side effect: It could speed his
death.
   Perry is a prisoner on Death Row, and his fate will be argued
Tuesday before the U.S. Supreme Court. The state of Louisiana wants
to force him to take psychiatric medication; if he is legally sane,
he can be executed.
   Perry's lawyers argue that forcible medicating would be a cruel
and unusual punishment that ignores Perry's rights to avoid
unwanted medication.
   The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric
Association say treating Perry to aid in his execution would turn
the healing art on its head. Perry's sentence should be commuted to
life in prison, they suggest.
   ``We're saying the cost here, which is really a fundamental
realignment of the role of medicine, is a very high cost, and the
state's interest in the difference between capital punishment and
life imprisonment without parole doesn't justify that cost,'' said
attorney Joel Klein.
   The state says giving him the drug is simply a necessary step
for carrying out a death sentence, a justifiable limitation on a
condemned man's liberties much like strapping him into the electric
chair. Besides, the state is required to provide medical care, and
the medicine is good for him, Louisiana says.
   Perry, 35, suffers from schizoaffective disorder, causing him
delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking.
   He was sentenced in 1985 for shooting his parents and three
other family members to death. Louisiana's supreme court affirmed
the conviction and the sentence but suggested a review of Perry's
mental competence to be executed.
   There is a tradition in Anglo-American law that people should
not be executed while insane. This doctrine, which dates back to
medieval times, was adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1986
decision.
   ``Insanity'' is a legal term, not a medical one. In this case it
refers to mental illness so severe that the prisoner is not aware
of the impending punishment and why he is to suffer it.
   The Louisiana court ruled Perry was sane, but only while on
medication. It also ordered that Perry be medicated even over his
objection.
   After the state supreme court refused to hear a challenge to
that decision, Perry's lawyers appealed to the federal high court.
   Lawyers for both sides declined to be interviewed on the record,
but their Supreme Court briefs lay out their arguments in detail.
   Lawyers for Louisiana say the death sentence wiped out any legal
power Perry would have to refuse the medication.
   Forced medication would not be a ``cruel and unusual''
punishment because Perry would benefit medically from it, the state
says. ``Common sense dictates that the State does not violate the
Eighth Amendment by doing something good for a prisoner.''
   In fact, Louisiana is required to medicate Perry because the
Supreme Court has declared that deliberately ignoring a prisoner's
serious medical need itself constitues cruel and unusual
punishment, the brief says.
   Perry's attorneys say the forced medication would be
unconstitutional punishment rather than treatment. The court order
gives no consideration to Perry's medical needs nor physician
judgment, they say.
   The order also ignores the ``very real'' prospect of serious
side effects, raising the prospect of taking a ``drooling,
incontinent and tremulus'' man to the execution chamber, they
wrote.
   In any case, Perry's lawyers say, Perry's response to medication
is sporadic and unpredictable, making it impossible to say whether
he would be competent on the day of his execution.
   ``With this instability and unpredictability, how is Michael's
execution to be carried out?'' the lawyers asked. ``Can the state
wait until a `good day' and execute Michael? Can Michael be
executed if his `good days' outnumber his `bad days' by some
amount? What amount? And what happens if the date set in the death
warrant is a `bad day?' ''
   The AMA and psychiatric association, meanwhile, say the death
sentence does not outweigh Perry's interest in avoiding unwanted
medication, an interest especially great ``when the injection sets
the prisoner directly on the road to execution.''
   Involuntary medication was not part of Perry's sentence, nor is
it generally authorized by confinement, the associations argue.
   Prior court decision support the idea that involuntary medical
treatment is not permitted if it runs against a person's medical
interests and is not necessary to treat a condition that may harm
other people, they say.
   As for the argument that the medication would help Perry, any
benefit ``would be both fleeting and purchased at the cost of his
life,'' the associations said in a brief.
   Outside observers are split on their reaction to the case.
   Dr. Gary Glass, an associate psychiatry professor at Temple
University and lecturer in law at Villanova University, said he
personally hopes that the court would not allow execution of a
person who is incompetent when not treated.
   But his ``utilitarian, practical'' answer is that nobody should
be allowed to make a competent decision to avoid execution by
becoming legally incompetent, he said.
   If a death sentence is imposed Tuesday.
   Brightman, Lloyd Webber's second wife, originated the role of
Christine in both the London and New York productions of ``The
Phantom of the Opera.'' Before joining the New York cast of
``Aspects,'' she will perform in a concert tour of ``The Music of
Andrew Lloyd Webber'' from Oct. 8 through Nov. 4.
   Lloyd Webber announced in July that he was ending his six-year
marriage to Brightman and that he had become close friends with a
27-year-old businesswoman, Madeleine Gurdon.

   TORONTO (AP) - Nichelle Nichols says she wasn't particularly
interested when her friend Gene Roddenberry insisted that she
audition for a part in his new science fiction television series.
   That was in 1966. Even now, Nichols considers ``Star Trek'' to
be ``just an interruption in my singing career, a nice interlude.''
   Still, while Nichols is best known for her role as Lt. Uhura,
she has never abandoned her musical career. Her one-woman show,
``Reflections,'' opens Thursday in Toronto.
   Nichols, born in Chicago in 1936, was discovered by Duke
Ellington, toured with Lionel Hampton and danced with Sammy Davis
Jr. Eventually, she was playing successful engagements in European
nightclubs.
   Next thing she knew, she was decoding subspace communiques from
Starfleet Command.
   In ``Reflections,'' Nichols pays tribute to a legion of legends,
some of them old friends, including Eartha Kitt, Lena Horne,
Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson, Pearl Bailey and Sarah Vaughan.
   But Trekkies need not fear. She and the old Enterprise crew
``are still family,'' she says, and she's looking forward to ``Star
Trek VI.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Frederica von Stade's celebrity and career as an
opera singer are not marital assets that can be measured and shared
with her estranged husband, a judge has ruled.
   Manhattan Judge Walter Schackman rejected the claim of von
Stade's husband of 18 years, Peter Elkus, who said he sacrificed
his career to nurture hers as her voice coach, manager and adviser.
   Schackman said Elkus' contribution's to his wife's career will
be an issue to be decided with others at the couple's divorce
trial.
   Von Stade, 45, a mezzo-soprano with the Metropolitan Opera,
married Elkus in 1972 and the couple separated in 1988, court
papers show. They have two teen-aged daughters.

   Mabel Yee was just another frustrated
commuter stuck in the middle of her stop-and-go crawl to wrk, when
an idea hit her like an antsy driver following too close.
   ``I thought, `Gosh - there must be some option to just sitting
here . . . This is stupid. There must be something to do,' '' she
said.
   Eighteen months later, Yee has found lots for commuters to do.
Her company, Commuter Products Corp., sells dozens of products to
keep drivers busy, safe, relaxed, fed or just plain entertained.
   Driven mad by traffic? Yee offers relief with a massaging car
seat, stress-reduction tapes, stereo headrests and an electronic
message board that tells tailgaters to back off.
   No time for breakfast? Keep a croissant fresh in a compact
refrigerator and pop it into an envelope-style, foil-lined oven
that plugs into the cigarette lighter. The Road Hog apron and lap
tray will keep the gray suit and red tie clean.
   Every minute counts? There are portable fax machines, travel
desks and note boards that clip onto the steering wheel.
   Comuter Products also offers gadgets for before or after a
commute. Among them: an under-the-pillow alarm that literally
shakes up a sleeper without disturbing anyone else, a multi-pocket
folder to organize glove box rubble, and a Car Finder that turns on
the lights and honks the horn of your car from 200 feet way.
   Prices range from $4.95 for a tiny clipboard that attaches to a
window with suction cups to $1,595 for the PortaFax.
   Yee declined to reveal sales figures or say if her company was
making money, but she said response so far has been enthusiastic.
   ``I didn't have any of this! I had to go looking for a piece of
paper . . . jot it down and still had to drive,'' said Yee, 38, who
quit her job in marketing and sales for Xerox Corp. to start her
company.
   Yee said commuters are a huge group of consumers that have been
virtually ignored.
   ``There are business markets, sports markets, but no one seems
to think of commuters,'' she said.
   The average Californian, for instance, now spends 45 minutes
commuting each way to work, and the average ``speed'' is 35 miles
per hour - expected to coast down to 17 miles per hour by the end
of the century, according to Yee.
   ``Auto manufacturers just look at the car - how fast does it go,
what about the tires, how to make it pretty,'' she said. ``We look
at the person inside the car saying, `Get me out of here!' ''
   Yee sells to that trapped soul through her ``Love to Commute''
catalogue, drawing customers worldwide.
   ``We actually had a guy call us on a cellular from New Jersey''
and place an order from his car, she said.

<HEAD>`The Race to Save the Planet' - Local Heroes Make for Global
Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the best things about PBS' thoughtful new
series, ``The Race to Save the Planet,'' is that it doesn't try to
sugarcoat the bad news. And just describing the global environment
means plenty of bad news.
   The 10-hour series is running weekly, starting last Thursday; it
also is running marathon style, two hours a night for five nights
beginning Sunday.
   ``The Race to Save the Planet'' shows the state of the world's
environment and the interconnectedness of its problems that
threaten it. The series is an antidote to despair. It's sad and
scary, but it's neither shrill nor naive.
   ``We thought it was time for a series to attempt to show that
there is a way forward,'' said executive producer John Angier, a
co-founding producer of PBS' distinguished science series,
``Nova,'' in 1975.
   ``Really, the television audience and the magazine-reading
public have probably had quite enough of doom and gloom and there
were other stories to tell,'' he said. ``The structure of the
series is such that it kind of goes from the bad news to the good
news.''
   What a lot of bad news there is. Humanity, the series notes, has
been adversly affecting its environment since the Neolithic
Revolution, when we changed as a species from hunter-gatherers to
farmer-herders.
   Our first experiments with agriculture were dismal flops,
exhausting the land with overcultivation, overgrazing and
deforestation. The Neolithic Revolution's basic lesson was that
desert can always return. And may yet.
   A few thousand years later, efficient agriculture created the
next great human leap forward. The Industrial Revolution's basic
lesson: Surplus food from fewer farmers means more people can go to
work in factory towns.
   That revolution's crowning achievment (once you got past the
smog) was to fling our species into space. And once we got out
there, we looked back at our cradle and saw a big, blue jewel,
spinning in space, alone and unique.
   That powerful image of the planet - along with smog, dead lakes
and tainted springs - helped create the Environmental Revolution.
The first Earth Day was in 1970; the first global conference on the
environment in 1972.
   That revolution's basic lesson: You're running out of time and
space. You can breed yourself to starvation, you can asphyxiate or
poison yourself, you can drown in your own dung heap. It's later
than you think.
   ``In a way, human history with respect to the environment is a
series of experiments, and on many occasions the experiments have
not worked,'' Angier said. ``The big difference between now and
10,000 years ago is the scale.
   ``Now the scale is global. It comes down to a question of room.
Once there was room to make mistakes; now we've come to the end of
the planet.''
   Our destruction of the rain forest - which ecologists call ``the
lungs of the planet'' - is just such an experiment.
   It was chillingly reported on PBS' excellent ``Frontline''
series by Adrian Cowell, ``The Decade of Destruction,'' and Bill
Kurtis' ``The Rain Forest Imperative'' on cable's A&amp;E (repeating in
December).
   We lose about 1{ acres of rain forest each second. We still
don't know how many species of plants and insects exist, and yet
we're discarding entire species each day. We literally do not know
what we're losing.
   ``We human beings are part of this terrifically complicated
biological scheme that we're only just beginning to glimpse the
workings of,'' Angier said.
   ``What we don't know is the extent to which you can chip away at
that biological scheme before it collapses and can't support us,
human life,'' he said. ``All the biologists can tell you is that
this is a really dangerous game, and we don't know what we're
dealing with.''
   ``The Race to Save the Planet'' moves from from the
macroclimate's global warming and thinning of the ozone, to the
microclimate, analyzing the sources of air pollution in Los Angeles
and water pollution in Europe's Rhine River.
   Each of the environmental issues the series tackles becomes a
story with a human face. Economic development in the Third World
creates environmental disasters; preserving its wildlife takes
second place to human hunger.
   The ``Remnants of Eden'' segment shows a bloody-muzzled leopard
in a Kenyan game park gazing at gridlocked busloads of tourists.
   Angier says he gets irritated by TV wildlife shows with
beautiful animals at work and prey. ``What the camera didn't show
you,'' he said, ``is it's almost always in a nation that's
struggling with great poverty and hunger.''
   The western world's economic development decimated its wildlife
and deforested Europe, The same thing is happening in the Third
World, he said, and the pace is accelerating.
   The series is honest. It came up against the economic realities
of alternatives to fossil fuels, and concluded that biomass,
cogeneration, 100-mpg cars and other alternatives become practical
only when oil is too expensive.
   That frank assessment was balanced, however, by a visit to the
remarkable, energy-conserving residents of Osage, Iowa. They're
ordinary people who have learned how economical and comfortable it
is to use energy efficiently.
   The series also looks at the Green Revolution, how it almost
went belly-up in Indonesia thanks to a new, high-yield rice that
was plagued by insect infestation.
   And, with world population expected to double in 60 years, the
series looks at how different governments are dealing with
burgeoning populations.
   ``Population is kind of the silent guest at the table for every
one of these issues,'' said Linda Harrar, a ``Nova'' producer who
conceived the series when it became obvious there was too much
material for the science show.
   ``The Race to Save the Planet'' was filmed in 30 nations on all
seven continents. It reiterates the hard choices we face as a
species, and that environmental solutions ultimately derive from
individual behavior.
   It demands leadership from our politicians and shows us local
heroes whose work may help bring about global change. That's the
secret of ``The Race to Save the Planet:'' It's not so much about
nature as it is about people.
   ``The planet itself is going to do just fine without us,''
Angier said. ``It's the people that are the problem, and their
place on the planet.
   ``Nature's going to go on no matter what we do - in some form or
other.''
   It just won't be that big, blue jewel, spinning alone in space.
And we won't be there to wave goodbye.

   National Writer Fred Bayles spent nearly three
weeks with the 14 men of the National Guard's 265th Quartermaster
Detachment as they mobilized, trained and deployed to Saudi Arabia.
In a diary of those days, Bayles traces the men's activities from a
rousing sendoff from their small hometown in South Carolina to
their arrival in the Middle East.

   The 14 members of the 265th Quartermaster Detachment aren't
professional soldiers. Henry Harris, a retired schoolteacher, is
the oldest at 51; Mark Rooker, a college sophomore, is 20. The rest
work in construction or at the local correctional facility, or
drive trucks.
   Eight are married, and nearly all have children. But the 265th
is a second family. A majority have been in the unit 16 years or
more. Like any family, there are rivalries and grudges and
arguments. There also is camaraderie.
   Sgt. Earnest Deloach, an 18-year veteran, had his gripes about
being mobilized. His income plunged, he missed his son's 16th
birthday, he limped along through training on a pulled hamstring.
So it was a surprise to hear him say he didn't have to go.
   ``I could have gotten out of it,'' he says, covered with sweat
on a beach by the Persian Gulf, ``but my guys were going.''
   ---
   THURSDAY, AUG. 30:
   The 265th arrives for training at Fort Stewart, Ga., with little
fanfare. The night before, a huge crowd showed up in the heat of
Allendale, S.C., to send them off. The turnout beat attendance at
the last county fair.
   Fort Stewart is empty. Much of the 24th Infantry already is
gone. All that's left are yellow ribbons and signs along the road
bestowing God's blessings on the departed soldiers.
   The 265th, a water purification unit, spent the past week
packing pickup trucks and completing inventories and assorted
paperwork, including wills.
   Quarters are in the post's National Guard section: old
cinderblock barracks with wooden roofs and not much else. Bare bulb
lighting, no plumbing, no fans to stir the heavy damp air. ``These
accommodations will seem luxurious once you get to Saudi Arabia,''
says a lieutenant colonel as a way of welcome.
   ---
   FRIDAY, AUG. 31:
   Paperwork day. The men get new dogtags and identification cards
as temporary members of the regular Army. Pay vouchers have to be
filed, medical records checked. The men are inoculated for
meningitis and typhoid. Each step is long and boring. Sitting,
waiting, in the rows of folding chairs at the processing center,
Sgt. Herman Roberts complains of stomach pains. Sgt. Ronnie
Jackson, commander of the 265th, starts to hector him like one half
of an old married couple. ``How come every time we go on a trip you
get gas?'' he asks loudly.
   ---
   SATURDAY, SEPT. 1:
   NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) training. Films of bunnies,
goats and pigeons thrashing around and dying from nerve agents.
Sgt. Ernie Deloach shakes his head as each victim succumbs. After
awhile, the films become predictable and the men begin to nod off
in the darkened room as animals die on screen.
   Excerpts of classnotes: ``Don't lay down if exposed to choking
agents: your lungs will fill with fluid. ... Nerve agent warning
signs: runny nose, headache, drooling, twitching ... ''
   Someone asks if there's going to be a test on the information.
``The test is going to be when you hit land over there,'' says the
sergeant-instructor.
   --
   TUESDAY, SEPT. 4:
   PT (physical training) every morning now at 6 a.m., led by Capt.
Robert Appiah. ``Side straddle hop,'' he says and the men answer in
a shout, ``SIDE STRADDLE HOP!'' Most keep up, with the requisite
amount of cheating on pushups and situps. Running is the killer.
The group does three miles, then groans as Appiah turns them around
to pick up stragglers. ``Make them run,'' they shout.
   Ulysses Calhoun is gung-ho for the first two miles, taunting the
others. After that he is gasping with the rest. ``My overdrive
kicked in, and then it kicked out again,'' he explains.
   One running cadence:
   ``They say in the Army, the women are mighty fine;
   I went out with one late last night, she looked like
Frankenstein;
   Oh Lord I want to go, Oh how I want to go;
   Oh Lord I want to go (four-beat pause) HOME!''
   ---
   WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 5:
   Lectures from a chaplain on Islam and Arab culture. Chaplain
pronounces it AYE-RAB. What not to do: Don't point or make the
A-okay sign, it's considered giving somebody the evil eye. Don't
show the bottom of your foot, it's considered an insult. Don't do
anything with your left hand, it's the ``sanitation hand'' in the
AYE-RAB world. And of course, don't drink, eat pork or look at the
women.
   ``I believe we're going to the wrong place,'' says Sgt. Hullie
Cohen. ``You can't do nothing.''
   The men get a special delivery envelope of drawings from the
Hampton, S.C., Elementary School. Included is this note:
   ``To the soilders, from Summer Pope, God Bless. The sun is hot,
but just remember we love you.''
   ---
   FRIDAY, SEPT. 7:
   Range day. The novelty of firing new M-16s wears off quickly in
the heat and humidity. Each man must zero in his weapon, a process
of shooting, trudging to view the result, trudging back to the
firing pit, adjusting the sights and then doing it all over again.
   Everybody feels better at the night range. It's cooler, and
tracer fire laces satisfyingly through lit targets. Night fire
invigorates the men. Don Graham kids about fathering another child
(he has seven). Willie Badger sings in a clear tenor to the tune
``When Johnny Comes Marching Home'':
   ``They handed me an M-16, hurrah, hurrah.
   They handed me an M-16, hurrah, hurrah.
   They handed me an M-16 and made me into a killing machine.
   And we'll all be dead by the summer of `92.''
   ---
   WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 12:
   Training over, the men pack and repack the trucks waiting for
the word they are going. Old trucks with outdated purification
units are to be put in storage. The men will get new units in Saudi
Arabia. ``Goodbye ladies,'' Sgt. Bill Bostick says to the trucks as
we drive past the motor pool.
   The men poise for group pictures. ``Say Saddam Hussein,''
Deloach says, mugging for the camera.
   The men go over for a last set of shots. Badger backs into the
room, eyes averted. ``I can't take needles,'' he says.

   FRIDAY, SEPT. 14:
   The unit ships out today. Families gather at the barracks in the
morning to say goodbye as 2{-ton trucks drive by honking their
horns. Drivers shout ``Good luck.'' The scene is oddly festive,
sort of like family day at a summer camp.
   Overheard conversations:
   Cohen's wife: ``I'm used to it with Hullie, he's been gone
before. But this is different. There wasn't a chance for war.''
   Curtis Young's mom: ``I told him when he signed up that sooner
or later this day would come.''
   Harris, who avoids MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat rations) whenever
possible, gets six cans of cocktail weiners from his wife. ``I
don't even like weiners,'' he grumbles. ``I guess I'll learn to
love `em.''
   ---
   SATURDAY, SEPT. 15:
   The C-141 appears as a bright light in the eastern sky and taxis
up to the hanger to load the trucks and take on fuel. The men file
aboard, cram into uncomfortable web seats and try to sleep for the
next nine hours to Spain. It is cold and cramped, but most are able
to fall asleep.
   Three hours layover at Torrejon. The men crowd around two sinks
in the bathroom to shave and brush their teeth. Definitely
different graffiti on the walls. One example: ``Marine TOW - Death
on a leash.''
   ---
   SUNDAY, SEPT. 16:
   We land in Saudi Arabia at 3 a.m. local time. Jet lag only
complicates reactions as F-15s take off overhead on a sheet of
flame and a roar.
   We get on a Saudi bus for the ride to Cement City, a marshalling
area for new troops. We wonder about a separate enclosed section at
the rear of the bus and realize it is for women. When we stop on
the side of highway at dawn to fix a flat, other traffic pulls to
the side and the drivers get out to kneel and pray.
   ``This is for real,'' says Bobby Youmanns.
   ---
   MONDAY, SEPT. 17:
   The dress code is simple here in Cement City. Everywhere you go,
you are to take your M-16 and carry your gas mask and canteen. To
the makeshift showers. To the latrines.
   Badger, Calhoun and Cohen draw guard detail at the front gate.
Two are up front to stop any cars, another backs them up from
concrete barriers a few dozen yards away. M-16s aren't loaded,
clips in pockets. Sitting between the barriers is a LAW, a small
rocket that can stop a truck.
   Calhoun puts some grape-flavored beverage additive to his
bottled water to cut the flat, mineral taste. I suggest it would
taste better if we could add some rum.
   ``Yeah,'' he brightens. ``We could call it Grum.''
   ---
   WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19:
   Racing from camp to a mess hall and a hot meal at the air base,
the canvas top rips off the back of the pickup and pummels the men.
It's dangerous; the whole top of the truck could come away. They
pound on the rear window with rifle butts. ``We're going to be
killed,'' shouts Harris, but he's laughing. The truck finally pulls
off for a quick repair.
   We get to the mess hall at sunset, as calls to prayer echo
through the sultry night air. There is a huge crowd of GIs lining
up for dinner. Youmanns, Cohen, Young and the others pile out. I
follow to say goodbye; I have to go back home.
   Each one of the men files past and shake hands as if we're part
of some martial reception line.
   ---
   The men of the 265th still are in Saudi Arabia. They could be
there for the next five months, doing their job of purifying water,
worrying about their families, thinking about home.
   At home, their families wonder and worry.
   Lillie Deloach misses her husband. ``I've had a headache since
he left,'' she says.
   Adele Harris is happy to hear news about hers. ``I went down to
the the post office and got a card from Henry. It just made my
whole week.''
   But mail is slow, and telephone calls are impossible. To
overcome the loneliness, the families plan to meet and share what
news they have.
   ``Hullie said you've got to be strong,'' says Estella Cohen.
``It's hard because I'm used to him here taking care of things. But
if they can take it being over there, I guess we'll have to take it
waiting for them at home.''

   The nation's economy nearly came to a
standstill in the second quarter, edging up a feeble annual rate of
0.4 percent, the government said.
   Many of the nation's top economists believe a recession is
imminent - if not under way already.
   While White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we don't
believe we are in a recession right now,'' he acknowledged
Tuesday's Commerce Department report on the gross national product
``is certainly cause for concern. It's not good news.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Michael Milken's lawyers have revealed their
strategy to keep him out of prison, portraying the convicted
financier as a repentant, misunderstood genius who has benefited
society and should be allowed to work with ghetto youth in a
``purposeful punishment.''
   In a sentencing proposal released Tuesday, less than a week
before a federal judge is scheduled to announce Milken's punishment
in the biggest securities fraud case in history, the defense
offered new insights into Milken's character.
   The 44-year-old former junk-bond wiz for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. pleaded guilty to six felonies in April, capitulating to
government pressure after insisting he was innocent for nearly four
years.

   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) - A huge Japanese electronics
concern said it is negotiating to buy entertainment giant MCA Inc.
in a deal valued at $7 billion, the latest move in Hollywood
globalization.
   The proposal announced Tuesday by Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. also demonstrates anew the foreign craving for American trophy
holdings.
   The merger, if completed, would mirror the 1989 acquisition of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment by Japan's Sony Corp. for $5
billion, which includes the assumption of debt. Matsushita makes
video equipment and audio and visual components under the brand
names Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Oil prices dipped as traders took profits from
their dramatic surge and awaited developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude fell 72 cents to $37.53 per barrel Tuesday for
November contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The drop pulled oil a little farther from the $40 mark that many
traders view as the next target. It represented just a partial
retreat from Monday's rise, which had pushed prices up almost $3
per barrel.

   DENVER (AP) - One major witness was allowed to testify in secret
and one refused to appear voluntarily as a hearing began on
conflict-of-interest allegations against Neil Bush, the president's
son.
   Outside, the federal courthouse was surrounded by news media,
security officers and protesters on Tuesday.
   The only thing missing was the center of all the attention. Neil
Bush, 35, did not show up for the first day of what is anticipated
to be a four-day proceeding before administrative law Judge Daniel
J. Davidson. Officials said Bush had to be present only when he was
to testify.

   MIAMI (AP) - Eastern Airlines trustee Martin Shugrue urged
President Bush to help minimize the damage Iraq crisis-triggered
fuel hikes are doing to the airline industry and to his carrier's
hopes for survival.
   ``The airlines cannot support the increased cost. Eastern cannot
support the increased cost,'' Shugrue said at Florida International
University on Tuesday. ``And the public cannot tolerate the
increased burden in air fares.''
   Shugrue called on the Bush administration to form a task force
of officials of the airlines, oil companies, his administration and
Congress to study and recommend actions on oil prices.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Moody's Investors Service downgraded the credit
rating of Chase Manhattan Corp., citing concern about the
deterioration of the bank's real estate loan portfolio.
   Moody's, one of the two major credit rating agencies, said
Tuesday that Chase's announcement Friday that it would halve its
dividend this quarter and boost its bad-loan reserves were positive
steps for the nation's second-largest bank.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Nearly half the samples in the nation's
principal agricultural seed collection are in danger, and the
collection's administration must be overhauled, says a National
Academy of Sciences study.
   The genes contained in the 232,210 samples in the National Seed
Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo., have been used to
develop new varieties of corn, wheat and other important crops.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly all U.S.-produced foods and 96 percent
of imported foods tested last year met government standards for
pesticide residues, the Food and Drug Administration said.
   In its annual study of pesticide residues, the FDA said Tuesday
that most of the violations found during the regular testing
involved pesticides being used on types of produce for which use of
the chemicals is not allowed.
   The violation rate in regular testing was about the same as for
the three previous years for both domestic and imported foods, the
FDA said.

   The stock market rallied Tuesday as institutional investors
snapped up blue-chip issues, but analysts dismissed the advance as
insignificant.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 32.67 to close at
2,485.64. previous session, when it settled at a 14-month low.
   The dollar advanced against all major currencies except the
Japanese yen. Gold prices pulled back slightly.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower, and grains and
soybeans were mixed.
   Long-term bonds were higher.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: ... future lawsuits.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The (government's) factual presentations are grossly distorted;
its discussion of legal principles and applicable law virtually
non-existent. . . . Indeed, in its zeal to enhance Mr. Milken's
punishment, the government's sentencing memorandum is inconsistent
with portions of its own plea agreement and with the
representations the government made to the court at the time of Mr.
Milken's plea.
   . . . First, the government's memorandum confirms that there is
no evidence linking Mr. Milken in any way to a significant number
of the alleged acts which the government asks this court to
consider.
   . . . Second, the government has provided a highly selective
version of its own evidence on a host of other transactions which
it urges this court to consider.
   . . . The government's sentencing memorandum also seeks to
punish Mr. Milken for acts which do not constitute crimes. . . . it
even blames Mr. Milken for the fact that in December 1989 - one
year after the government banished Mr. Milken from Drexel and
barred any Drexel employee from even talking to him about anything
directly or indirectly relating to business - Drexel, which was
then led by John Shad, the former chairman of the SEC, paid large
bonuses to its employees.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BURDEN OF PROOF</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   To accept the government's position would subject Mr. Milken to
punishment on charges that the government had agreed previously to
dismiss with prejudice, and would impose on this court the
obligation to issue extensive findings of fact and conlusions of
law on all matters that would have arisen had Mr. Milken actually
proceeded to trial. To attempt to resolve these matters without
full evidentiary hearings would violate due process. But to hold
such hearings, which could last as long as a trial, would be
contrary to sound principles of judicial administration and would
be inconsistent with the essence of the plea agreement.
   . . . The sentencing stage is not the time to conduct new trials
on new offenses.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON COMPARABLE CASES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Unlike its typical sentencingmemorandum, the government here
does not analyze the relevant sentencing precedents in this
district. The reason is obvious: The government's recommendation
that Mr. Milken receive ``a substantial period of incarceration''
cannot be reconciled with these precedents.
   . . . only three of the nearly 100 securities law violators
sentenced in this district who pleaded guilty received prison
sentences greater than one year and one day.
   . . . By every relevant indicator, Mr. Milken has fully and
unconditionally accepted complete responsibility for the crimes he
committed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON INSIDER TRADING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We would have expected the government to acknowledge that he was
no Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel, Dennis Levine or even Robert
Freeman.
   . . . No matter how unjust, it must brand Mr. Milken an insider
trader to justify its own investigation. Yet its four isolated
allegations of insider trading are easily refuted by documents and
testimony currently in the possession of the government.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HIS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government charges that Drexel provided unlawful gratuities
to money managers and other institutional fiduciaries, principally
in the form of lucrative investment opportunities. . . . Michael
Milken's business was not based on improper inducements to anyone.
   . . . The government's theory of wrongdoing presumes a world in
which no one ever recommends a security to a client or tries to
make money for a client, if the client works for an institutional
customer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON SAVINGS AND LOANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In a balanced sentencing memorandum, given the public clamor
over the savings and loan crisis, we would have expected the
government to disclose forthrightly that it does not contend that
Mr. Milken was responsible for the financial collapse of any
savings and loan. Obviously, although the government does not
publicly exonerate Mr. Milken in its 215-page memorandum, it makes
no claim, and presents no evidence, linking Mr. Milken to today's
savings and loan crisis.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON BOESKY DEALINGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   To understand the true nature of the transactions between Boesky
and Mr. Milken . . . it is necessary to understand the complex
relationship between a securities salesman and his or her customer.
. . . Scorekeeping by brokers of profits, lossses and favors for
accounts is common in the industry. So are efforts to make up
losses.
   . . . The government's principal evidence in support of its
position are the handwritten ledgers it has attached to its
sentencing memorandum, and Boesky's payment of a $5.3 million fee
to Drexel . . . But a careful review of the ledgers and of their
origins reveals that far from being the memorialization of a
Boesky-Milken illegal arrangement, the ledgers were nothing more
than an artifice used by both sides to gain an advantage through
scorekeeping.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government's allegation that Michael Milken obstructed
justice is as unfounded as its other allegations. To begin with,
much of what the government characterizes as ``obstruction'' is not
obstruction at all. During the immediate aftermath of the service
of grand jury and SEC subpoenas at Drexel, there was unquestionably
confusion, fear and paranoia. But confusion, fear and paranoia are
hardly illegal and were surely justifiable under the circumstances.
   . . . Under these circumstances, behavior that might otherwise
seem silly or even paranoid - furtive conversations or warnings
about who might be an informant - are perfectly understandable. And
they are not illegal.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON DREXEL, MILKEN'S WEALTH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Beyond urging this court to sentence Mr. Milken for additional
crimes in the absence of factual or legal support, the government
asks the court to punish Mr. Milken for the demise of Drexel and
for his wealth and his status in the community. These charges have
no place at sentencing, and do not befit the government.
   . . . As a result of Drexel's collapse (in bankruptcy court),
Mr. Milken has personally lost more than any other individual
investor.
   . . . The government's sentencing memorandum includes no fewer
than 25 references . . . to Mr. Milken's wealth and power in the
first 25 pages alone. . . . Just as such appeals to passion or
prejudice are forbidden at trial, they are equally offensive at
sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Here is a snapshot of Michael Milken, the
deposed junk-bond king who faces sentencing in the largest ever
securities fraud case against an individual:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Born on the Fourth of July in 1946, Milken grew up in Encino,
Calif. As a boy, he helped his father, an accountant, prepare tax
returns for clients. Milken graduated from the University of
California at Berkeley, majoring in business administration, and
married high-school sweetheart Lori Anne Hackel. He went on to
receive a master in business administration degree from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAREER:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken was hired full-time by Drexel's bond-trading department
in 1970 after working in its Philadelphia office during business
school. A rapid success, Milken was generating a substantial amount
of the firm's profits through his high-yield bond trading. In 1978,
the firm allowed Milken to move the high-yield bond department to
Beverly Hills, Calif. Drexel used junk bonds to finance hundreds of
small companies in the 1980s, reaping hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees. Junk bonds later were used to finance a wave of
corporate takeovers.
   Milken used some of his earnings to start charitable foundations
that he and his brother, Lowell, also a Drexel employee, endowed
with hundreds of millions of dollars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHARGES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After being linked in the press in late 1986 to an illegal stock
trading network led by admitted felon Ivan Boesky, Milken and
Drexel became the main targets of the government's insider trading
probe. They were charged with civil fraud and other allegations by
the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1988, and Drexel that
winter agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million
in penalties.
   Milken, his brother and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg were
indicted in March 1989 on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering
related to insider trading and other alleged securities violations
in a series of takeover deals from 1985 to 1987. Milken vowed to
fight the charges.
   Milken resigned from Drexel in June 1989, and set up a
consulting and investing firm.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PLEA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In a reversal, Milken agreed in April to a plea bargain with
prosecutors rather than go to trial. Friends said he saw no end to
the ordeal otherwise. Plus, the government agreed to drop all
charges against Lowell Milken.
   On April 24, 1990, Milken entered guilty pleas to six felonies
and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. Prosecutors said his
agreement to cooperate with investigators could help in other
prosecutions.
   Specifically, Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy, aiding and
abetting the filing of a false statement with the SEC, securities
fraud, aiding and abetting net-capital requirements, mail fraud and
assisting the filing of a false tax return.
   ``I realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to
me. I am truly sorry,'' he said tearfully in court.
   Sentencing by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood was set for Oct. 1.
Milken faces a maximum of up to 28 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of important developments
in the prosecution of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond
chief Michael Milken:
   May 12, 1986 - The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980. Levine is arrested.
   Nov. 14, 1986 - Stock speculator Ivan Boesky pays $100 million
to settle charges of insider trading on information supplied by
Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate with
investigators and to plead guilty to a single criminal charge.
Boesky later is sentenced to three years in prison.
   Late 1986 - Published reports link Michael Milken to an illegal
insider trading network led by Boesky.
   Sept. 7, 1988 - The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three others
of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in connection
with Boesky.
   Dec. 21 - Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud case in history. Drexel also must settle
related SEC charges and cooperate with the government
investigation.
   March 29, 1989 - A federal grand jury indicts Milken, brother
Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg on 98 counts of
racketeering and fraud largely based on information supplied by
Boesky. Potential penalties and fines total about $12 billion plus
possible prison terms.
   April 7 - The Milkens plead innocent. Newberg enters an innocent
plea later.
   April 13 - Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
   June 15 - Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his
own consulting firm. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing
law.
   Sept. 11 - Drexel pleads guilty to six felonies and begins
paying more than $650 million in fines, penalties and interest.
   Feb. 13, 1990 - Drexel's parent company files for federal
bankruptcy court protection after failing to meet short-term debt
payments. The securities firm, once the nation's fifth-largest,
starts laying off its 5,400 employees.
   March 19 - Prosecutors promise to bring a new indictment with
broader charges against Milken by the week of April 16.
   April 4 - Boesky is released from federal custody after
completing two years of a three-year term.
   April 19 - Four months of negotiations intensify between the
government and Milken for a possible plea bargain to settle the
case as a deadline looms for the new indictment.
   April 20 - Milken capitulates, agreeing to plead guilty to six
felony counts and pay fines and restitution totaling $600 million
under a plea agreement with prosecutors. He faces a maximum 28
years in prison.
   April 24 - Milken formally enters his plea before U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1.
   Sept. 24 - Prosecutors and defense lawyers agree to release
edited versions of pre-sentencing memos to Judge Wood. The
government says it wants Wood to consider other alleged wrongdoing
by Milken before deciding his punishment.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Compromise on Program Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate passage of a stock market reform bill
that expands the Securities and Exchange Commission's powers was
reached after congressional staffers hammered out a compromise on
program trading.
   The compromise bill, passed on a voice vote Tuesday, will allow
the SEC to regulate the controversial computer-driven trading
strategy during times of extreme market turbulence, known as
volatility.
   ``Volatility frightens away the investors American firms need to
compete and grow,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee which oversees the SEC. ``The reforms the
Senate enacted today take aim at excess volatility, letting the SEC
stop such practices before they do their damage,'' he added.
   The legislation is expected to move to the full House within a
few days. If passed by the House, the bill would then go to
President Bush for his signature.
   ``This legislation strengthens the SEC's oversight of our
securities markets and the participants in those markets,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., one of the bill's original
sponsors.
   The bill was worked out between the staffs of the Senate banking
Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee over the last
month.
   ``The talks were very cordial,'' said a House committee aide.
   In addition to the program trading curb, the compromise market
reform bill contains provisions passed separately by both the House
and Senate.
   One expands the authority of the SEC chairman to shut down the
securities markets, with presidential permission, in times of
market emergency. Previously only the president could order a
trading halt.
   Other provisions:
   - Require large securities traders to report their market
positions to the SEC.
   - Mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks,
options and futures contracts between the SEC and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   - Require the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, the
CFTC and SEC to report annually to Congress on their efforts to
protect the integrity of the markets.
   - Give the SEC authority to assess the financial health of the
parent holding companies of broker-dealers.
   The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the one-time junk
bond giant of Wall Street, was precipitated in February by the
failure of its parent holding company, which SEC officials have
complained they had no authority to monitor.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said he was ``very pleased with
the Senate passage of the market reform bill'' and looked forward
to ``the continuing congressional process.''
   The original House version, the Securities Markets Reform Act
passed in June, contained a provision giving the SEC authority to
limit program trading ``during periods of extraordinary market
volatility'' - the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices.
   The original Senate version, the Market Reform Act passed last
month, did not have a program trading provision.
   Critics of program trading, the rapid-fire transactions through
computerized buy and sell programs of enormous blocks of stocks,
blame it for worsening the 1987 stock market crash and the
190-point market drop last Oct. 13.
   They are especially critical of one form of program trading,
index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of
small, brief price differences between the stock and futures
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while
selling in the other.
   Critics say that strategy andthe volatility that often seems to
accompany it have driven small investors out of the stock market.
   But industry groups including the New York Stock Exchange and
the Securities Industry Association have said their studies have
not shown program trading to be the cause of the 1987 crash and
suggested other ways to control market volatility.

   U.S. car and truck makers turned in surprisingly
strong mid-September sales figures, down 5.6 percent from last
year, leading to speculation among analysts that the Mideast crisis
has yet to affect showroom traffic.
   The 10 major U.S. automakers reported Tuesday their car and
truck sales for the Sept. 11-20 period fell to an average daily
rate of 35,810 vehicles compared with a rate of 37,948 during the
same time last year.
   A 42.3 percent increase in the sales of cars by Japanese
companies was offset by a 7.5 percent decline in cars made by
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. The Big
Three held 85.7 percent of the car market in mid-September.
   ``On the whole, it was a pretty good number,'' said auto analyst
David Healy of Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment bankers in New
York. ``I didn't expect them to come anywhere close to last year.''
   Car sales were down 2.6 percent and truck sales were off 10.5
percent.
   The decline in truck sales led Healy to wonder if the effects of
rising gasoline prices stemming from the Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
may begin showing up in dealerships soon.
   ``If cars are down 2 percent and trucks are down 10 (percent),
maybe there is a little shying away from gas-guzzling trucks,'' he
said.
   Analysts speculated the sales rate may have received a jolt from
wheeling and dealing that goes on in showrooms this time of year as
dealers switch over from 1990 models to 1991 versions.
   Last year at this time automakers offered big incentives to
shrink bloated new-vehicle inventories. This year, inventories are
lower, lessening the need for incentives.
   ``An amazing performance,'' economist Tom Webb of the National
Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va., said of the
mid-September sales rate. ``Even skittish consumers are finding the
model year closeout bargains too good to pass up.''
   Chrysler's truck sales fell 18.5 percent, partly because of a
lack of incentives on the vehicles and patience by consumers
waiting to see the redesigned 1991 models, company officials and
analysts said.
   ``A lot of people probably know that there is a new minivan
coming so they're not flooding the showrooms,'' said auto analyst
Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc.
   So far this year, car and truck sales by the 10 companies were
down 4.6 percent, with car sales off 5.4 percent and truck sales
down 3.1 percent.
   Ford said a 7.9 percent decline in its truck sales and a 7.3
percent drop in its car sales during mid-September combined for a
7.6 percent decline in vehicle sales. For the year, Ford's cars and
trucks were selling at a pace 9 percent slower than last year.
   GM said its truck sales declined 16.3 percent from last year and
car sales dropped 6.4 percent, combining for a 10 percent fall in
vehicle sales. The automaker's sales so far this year were running
4.8 percent behind last year.
   Chrysler, which has been struggling with weakening sales nearly
all year, said its mid-September car sales were down 18.5 percent
from last year and truck sales were off 12.1 percent, combining for
a 15.1 percent decline in vehicle sales. Through Sept. 20 of this
year, Chrysler's car and trucks sales declined 15 percent compared
with last year.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co.'s proposed $7 billion acquisition of entertainment conglomerate
MCA Inc. would yield a fully-integrated company combining two top
players in entertainment hardware and software.
   The new multinational enterprise, if formed, would marry the
maker of Technics, Panasonic and Quasar audio and video equipment
with MCA's broad strength in movie, record and television
production.
   By purchasing MCA, Matsushita would control not only premium
film producer Universal Studios, but also a valuable film library,
MCA Records, Universal Television, powerful MCA-Universal Home
Video, MCA's growing theme park franchise, a cable television unit,
a publishing group, a concert and sports merchandising arm, movie
theaters and a 49 percent share in movie theater chain Cineplex
Odeon.
   ``The long-term advantages are that when you make hardware you
can benefit from the software producer's success,'' said Jeffrey
Logsdon, an entertainment analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities.
``There's an insatiable consumer demand for entertainment
software.''
   Matsushita says MCA is one of the companies with which
Matsushita is involved in talks; and MCA, in a statement, confirmed
it is ``in discussions with a major international company regarding
a possible negotiated acquisition of MCA.''
   Two MCA board members said in interviews that they could neither
confirm nor deny that a deal with Matsushita was being discussed.
MCA President Sidney Sheinberg did not return telephone messages.
   In Tuesday's edition, The Wall Street Journal said Matsushita
was offering between $70 and $80 a share for MCA stock, or a range
of about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion for the conglomerate.
   Stock in MCA Inc., which struck a 52-week low of $34.12{ in
trading Monday, surged $19.25 Tuesday, or more than 57 percent, to
$53.75. Other entertainment stocks also advanced in trading, with
Paramount Communications up $3.12{ to $34.75 a share.
   The Journal said Matsushita wants to keep MCA management in
place.
   More than a quarter of Matsushita's revenues are generated by
sales of video equipment. Audio and electronic components combine
for another 22 percent of revenues.
   The surprise is not that Matsushita finally decided to make such
a move - other foreign investors have been moving through Hollywood
as though it were a swap meet - but that it is considering a
company as massive as MCA.
   Matsushita had sales of about $44.4 billion last year, and is
the world's 25th largest publicly held company in the world,
according to a Morgan Stanley survey in June.
   In 1989, MCA's revenues were $3.4 billion with an income of $191
million. While it looks small in comparison, MCA is in fact a
sprawling, strapping enterprise.
   The Matsushita purchase exceeds Sony's acquisition of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment for $5 billion last year. Columbia was - and
still is - a struggling studio with limited assets, and has yet to
become a significant motion picture force since the buyout. MCA, on
the other hand, is a vital concern.
   Foreign purchase of U.S. entertainment enterprises makes sound
financial sense. Entertainment is the United States' second leading
export, accounting for a net positive trade balance of
approximately $5 billion.
   The continuing deregulation of the European television and the
boom in overseas VCR sales (almost 60 percent of Japanese homes
have VCRs) have created a nearly insatiable need for U.S.
programming.
   If completed, the MCA buyout would surely renew criticism of
Japanese control of American assets that surfaced last year in the
deals for New York's Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures
Entertainment.
   The Japanese had been keeping a low profile in such transactions
until a Tokyo golf tycoon purchased the Pebble Beach golf resorts
in California for about $950 million.
   The merger also might face regulatory barriers. MCA owns
independent television station WWOR in Secaucus, N.J., which a
foreign company would be prevented from owning.
   Michael Ovitz, the head of the talent agency Creative Artists
Agency Inc., has represented Matsushita in its attempts to find a
software counterpart. A CAA spokesman said Tuesday it was premature
to speculate if Ovitz would have any role in the new enterprise.
   Although MCA's Universal Pictures is not Hollywood's top film
studio - that honor is shared currently by Disney and Paramount -
many of its recent releases have been huge box-office hits.
   In 1982, Universal released the highest-grossing movie ever,
``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' and the film went on to set records
at the nation's video stores in 1988. The company has also reaped
large profits from 1973's ``The Sting,'' 1975's ``Jaws,'' 1985's
``Back to the Future'' and 1988's ``Twins.''
   Current and upcoming Universal releases include ``White
Palace,'' the X-rated ``Henry &amp; June,'' ``Darkman,'' ``Child's Play
II'' and ``Kindergarten Cop.''
   MCA Records carries the popular teen vocalist Tiffany, as well
as the sultry star Sheena Easton and young soul singer Bobby Brown.
   Universal Television produces the shows ``Murder, She Wrote,''
``Quantum Leap,'' several ``Columbo'' movies, the comedies
``Coach,'' ``Major Dad'' and ``Uncle Buck'' and the dramas ``Over
My Dead Body'' and ``Law &amp; Order.''
   Universal Studios Hollywood was the nation's third most-popular
theme park in 1989, drawing 5.1 million visitors.
   MCA has an agreement with Nippon Steel to explore Japanese
theme-park ventures, and a co-venture with Britain's Rank
Organisation to develop theme park ideas for France or England.
   Rank bought half of Universal Studios Florida in early 1989 in a
deal valued at $150 million. The theme park is partially owned by
Cineplex Odeon Corp. of Toronto, of which MCA owns 49 percent.

   The proposed takeover of MCA marks the latest
chapter in one of Hollywood's great success stories - the rise of
MCA from jazz band booker to colossus of the entertainment
industry.
   On Tuesday, Matsushita and MCA Inc. said they were in talks for
a possible merger valued at about $7 billion.
   MCA's transformation was stage-managed over the company's
65-year history by a Chicago eye doctor, the late Jules Stein, and
a one-time movie usher from Cleveland, Lew Wasserman.
   Stein laid the groundwork for MCA's dominance of the band
business and emergence as the top agency for movie talent.
Wasserman pushed the corporation into television and movie
production, tourist attractions and a myriad of enterprises.
   Though he deals in billions and is the confidant of presidents,
particularly former client Ronald Reagan, Wasserman has run the MCA
empire with a silken glove. He eschews interviews and
self-promotion; his biography in the Motion Picture Almanac lists
only his title as MCA chairman.
   Until 1959, MCA was known principally as The Octopus because of
its far-reaching influence as a talent agency. Then the company
took a giant step, buying the venerable, faltering Universal
Pictures (the Justice Department forced MCA to exit the agency
business or face anti-trust charges).
   Universal Pictures had been created by Carl Laemmle, known as
Uncle Carl because of his penchant for hiring relatives. He was a
pint-sized scrapper who left the clothing business in Oshkosh,
Neb., to open a nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906. He soon built a
theater chain, then launched his own production company,
challenging the motion picture trust, which demanded royalties for
use of Thomas Edison's inventions.
  The star system was started in 1910 when Laemmle lured Florence
Lawrence away from Biograph with a salary of $200 a week. He also
hired little Mary Pickford. In 1912 Laemmle gathered in other
independent companies to form Universal Pictures.
   ``I hope I'm not making a mistake going out there,'' said
Laemmle in a rare moment of self-doubt as he moved his film-making
to California. He paid $165,000 for a ranch on the north side of
the Hollywood Hills and opened Universal Studios in 1915.
   Irving Thalberg became studio manager in 1919; at 20 he was too
young to sign the paychecks. Universal flourished in the 1920s with
such stars as Lon Chaney and Mae Murray and directors such as John
Ford and Erich Von Stroheim.
   The studio specialized in westerns and horror. Classics included
Chaney's silent ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' and the talkies ``Dracula'' and ``Frankenstein.''
   The Depression staggered Universal, and in 1936 Laemmle was
eased out of command. In troubled times, stars seemed to emerge to
save Universal from ruin. In the 1930s it was soprano Deanna
Durbin. In the 1940s, funnymen Abbott and Costello.
   In 1946, the studio merged with the Independent International
Pictures to become Universal-International. The new management
tried to upgrade the studio's reputation with dramas like ``A
Double Life'' and ``All My Sons.'' But the staples remained the Ma
and Pa Kettle and Francis the Talking Mule series and sex-and-sand
epics with Maria Montez and Yvonne DeCarlo.
   Again the company faltered, and in 1952 Decca Records gained
control, restoring the original name. But Universal couldn't
weather a failing box office, and in 1959 it acquired a new owner,
the Music Corporation of America.
   Stein, besides practicing medicine, played in local jazz bands.
He decided musicians needed an agency to strike them better deals
with hotels, ballrooms and speakeasies.
   By the 1930s, MCA represented most of the name bands in the
swing era. And Stein set his sights on bigger game: Hollywood.
   Stein's chief aide, Lew Wasserman, proved a dynamo as head of
MCA's Hollywood office, and soon the agency represented a long list
of stars, including Joan Crawford, Errol Flynn and Alfred
Hitchcock.
   As the major studios shunned television as an upstart
competitor, MCA rushed in with its Revue Productions, grinding out
series like ``M Squad'' and ``Wagon Train.'' When Ronald Reagan's
film career faded, Wasserman found him work as host of ``General
Electric Theater.''
   Under Wasserman's guidance, MCA-Universal flourished in the
1970s and 1980s. The company became the biggest supplier of
television entertainment. Universal Studios Tours grew to a major
tourist attraction. The feature film division sometimes faltered,
but Steven Spielberg emerged from television to direct the
mega-hits ``Jaws'' and ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.'' MCA Records
also created huge profits.
   MCA-Universal has produced Academy Award winners (``The Sting,''
``The Deer Hunter,'' ``Out of Africa''), controversy (``The Last
Temptation of Christ'') and especially profits. The latter made it
highly attractive for a takeover or buyout, as confirmed on
Tuesday.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which got its
start with a break-through automatic rice cooker, is looking to
bolster its consumer electronics business while moving into
higher-profit industrial areas, analysts say.
   The company's products could stock an entire appliance store and
then some: radios, tape recorders, refrigerators, air conditioners,
video-cassette recorders and more.
   Some of its most widely recognized brands are Panasonic,
Technics and Quasar.
   Matsushita Electric confirmed it is negotiating to buy
entertainment giant MCA, which has a vast library of movies and
television programs, in a deal valued at around $7 billion.
   With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric
forms Japan's third largest corporation and commands the largest
share of Japan's home electronics market. A Morgan Stanley survey
in June ranked Matsushita the 25th-largest publicly-held
corporation in the world.
   It is also known to insiders as the ``Matsushita bank,''
reporting holdings of over $10 billion in cash assets alone last
year. Total sales topped $41.6 billion.
   The influence of legendary founder Konosuke Matsushita is felt
in virtually every Japanese home where an automatic rice cooker
takes the drudgery out of preparing the nation's staple food.
   Matsushita, a man who never went to high school yet became
Japan's most famous entrepreneur, popularized the electric rice
cooker in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy: ``To
manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant supply,
thereby enriching and improving life for everyone.''
   That comment in 1932 came a little less than 15 years after the
23-year-old Matsushita left his employer to capitalize on his own
electrical switch invention. Today, the Matsushita empire has
spawned nearly 500 related firms operating in 36 countries.
   During the 37 years it has operated in the United States,
Matsushita has built 12 factories, established seven sales
companies and a research facility and employs some 10,000 people.
   But the company is now facing a crossroads. Over 60 percent of
its sales have been concentrated in low-growth consumer products
such as refrigerators and video-cassette recorders. Compared to
other Japanese electronics makers, it is having difficulty making
the jump to more profitable industrial sectors, analysts say.
   It has also been unable to come up with a new hit product to
take the place of the wildly successful VCR, reflecting the
company's strength in manufacturing capability over inventive
prowess.
   Boris Petersik, an analyst for Barclay de Zoete Wedd Securities
Ltd., notes that Matsushita's mere size - including its 25,000
affiliated retailers in Japan - has proved a burden to shifting its
resources.
   The group plans to change, however. It developed a long-term
plan six years ago to focus on seven areas of high technology
including computers, semiconducters and communication technology.
   By 1992, the company hopes those areas will account for 40
percent of total sales.
   This year, the company has been investing huge amounts - some
400 billion Japanese yen ($3.2 billion) - in crystal displays,
computers and semiconductors. It is also trying to develop
profitable movie and television cameras for professional use,
Petersik said.
   But Matsushita has had a hard time cracking Sony's dominance on
the professional market as well as its lead in the consumer market
for VCRs. Sony now has the rich video software resources it
purchased last year in its $5 billion acquisition of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, he said.
   ``They don't want to lose completely on consumer products,'' he
said. The MCA acquisition, if it goes through, would both give the
company access to software to keep its consumer-products sales
healthy and to studios where it could introduce its professional
products.
   ``Software is going to be the critical factor'' in the video
market, Martin Beresford, senior analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., said of the Japanese company's possible MCA
purchase.
   A company spokesman in Tokyo said MCA is only one of the
companies with which Matsushita is involved in talks, but said
nothing had been decided. He said he could not comment further.
   The acquisition also would indicate that the company is
recovering from the death last year of the 94-year-old company
founder, according to Petersik.
   Revered as a visionary of Japanese business, Matsushita was also
one of Japan's richest men, leaving an estate valued $1.7 billion.
   And he was among Japan's most generous individuals. In a country
where charitable contributions do not qualify for tax breaks, he
established his own non-profit foundation, opened his factories to
the handicapped and endowed cultural institutions and a private
school for training future leaders.

<HEAD>Bond Resigns From Company He Founded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Financier Alan Bond resigned Wednesday
as chairman and director of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the company
he founded that has fallen victim to financial problems stemming
from a heavy debt load.
   Bond Corp. said in a statement that two other directors, Tony
Oates and Peter Mitchell, also resigned as senior executives. It
said Peter Lucas had accepted an appointment as the new chairman of
the board of directors.
   The company said Bond ``has been considering this course of
action for some time.''
   Bond, Oates and Mitchell will act as consultants to the company
until its proposed brewery sale and capital restructuring is
completed, Bond Corp. said.
   A spokesman said that after the restructuring and brewery sale
were completed, Bond, Oates and Mitchell would play no further role
in the company ``in the direct management sense.''
   Bond still retains a controlling interest in Bond Corp. through
his private company, Dallhold Investments.
   The resignation came earlier than expected. Bond said on July 20
he would resign once European and British bond holders had accepted
a Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. buyback offer. The offer is yet to be
accepted.
   Bond Corp., which reported an annual loss of 979 million
Australian dollars, worth $815 million (U.S.) at current exchange
rates, for the 1988-89 financial year, has had to sell assets to
reduce its crippling debt levels.
   The brash, flamboyant Bond rose rapidly from humble roots - his
first job was as a sign painter at 14 - by investing in land around
Perth and taking advantage of rapidly rising property values.
   With a flair for picking the best development sites and
promoting them well, he was made his first million dollars by 1969
at age 29.
   He rode out the 1987 stock market crash on strong cash flow from
his beer assets. But the man who built a fortune by making the most
of borrowed funds has been plagued by heavy debts, rising interest
rates and bad business decisions.
   The combination alienated his bankers and creditors, put his
Australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to
sell assets ranging from a Hong Kong development office to a coal
mine.
   Unlike business rival Robert Holmes a Court, who died recently
from a heart attack, Bond maintained a high public profile. He
probably is best known for financing the Australian sailing team's
stunning triumph over the United States in the 1983 America's Cup
race.

   Eastern Airlines may become a casualty of the
Persian Gulf crisis, says the carrier's trustee, who called for
presidential action to help alleviate the impact of fuel price
increases.
   ``The airlines cannot support the increased cost. Eastern cannot
support the increased cost,'' Martin Shugrue said Tuesday in a
speech at Florida International University. ``And the public cannot
tolerate the increased burden in air fares.''
   Shugrue was appointed to run Eastern last April, 13 months after
the Miami-based carrier filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
amid a crippling strike. He soon launched a much-publicized
marketing campaign to revitalize Eastern and it was making
progress, he said.
   ``We looked like we were about ready to take off. At the very
least, we were moving ahead. We were cooking. The trouble is, to
put it cutely, we're cooking with gas,'' Shugrue said.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the international
sanctions against Iraq, Shugrue said, Eastern's fuel prices have
jumped from 56 cents to 96 cents a gallon. At that rate, he said,
Eastern, which reached a 72 percent passenger load capacity for
August, would have to fly at 102 percent of capacity to break even.
   Shugrue said oil companies rushed to jack up prices, at the
airlines' expense.
   ``We are calling for the administration, President Bush, to do
two things that we need done immediately,'' Shugrue said.
   The first, he said, is to form a task force of officials of the
airlines, oil companies, administration and Congress to study and
recommend actions on oil prices.
   The second is a pledge by the president or secretary of
transportation to draw from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should
a domestic shortage develop.
   Shugrue said those actions could reduce oil prices by $5 to $10
per barrel right away. Crude oil futures prices have approached $40
a barerel in recent days, up from about $17 a barrel in July.
   He said afterward that he plans to write letters to the White
House and Transportation Department.

<HEAD>Airline Confirms Pan Am Shuttle Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines has confiemd it is in talks
about the possible purchase of the Pan Am Shuttle, and for the
backing of major aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies to
finance the deal.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Guiness Peat Aviation,
the world's largest aircraft-leasing company, and International
Aero Engines, a consortium of engine manufacturers, would finance
America West's purchase of the shuttle in exchange for the
airline's agreement to buy or lease more than 100 Airbus Industrie
A320 jets.
   America West issued a statement Tuesday confirming that it is
holding talks with ``manufacturers and certain potential lessors''
for the acquisition of Airbus A320 aircraft ``together with related
financial support and aircraft purchase options.''
   However, officials of the Phoenix-based airline declined to
discuss specifics.
   ``The possible transaction has not been finalized and an
appropriate announcement will be made if the transaction is
consummated,'' said Michael J. Conway, America West president.
   He also confirmed that the airline has held talks with Pan Am,
but said the discussions ``are ongoing and have not resulted in any
agreements.''
   The Times put the purchase price at $200 million, but Conway
said such speculation is ``premature and not well founded.''
   The Pan Am Shuttle flies between New York and Washington, D.C.,
and New York and Boston. Thomas Plaskett, chairman of Pan Am, said
last week that he expected to sell the shuttle by the end of the
year, although he declined to identify potential buyers.
   America West tried last year to buy the Trump Shuttle, which
also serves the New York-Boston-Washington corridor, but was unable
to come up with the necessary financing.
   Airbus Industrie, a European aerospace consortium, said last
week that it and General Electric Co., which makes engines for its
jets, had arranged for a $500 million loan for Northwest Airlines
as part of a deal in which Northwest would by 75 Airbus jets.
   Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus North America, said Airbus would
not loan any money to America West.
   But The Times quoted sources familiar with the talks as saying
Airbus ``was instrumental in arranging the financing'' for the
shuttle purchase, and said the deal could be closed as early as
Friday.
   Officials of Guiness Peat Aviation and International Aero
Engines delined comment.
   America West Chairman Ed Beauvais said last month that the
airline was discussing the possible acquisition of an undisclosed
number of A320 jets, but refused to discuss details, saying it
would ``create needless speculation.''
   He also said the airline was trying to acquire more Boeing
737-300s, which make up the bulk of the carrier's fleet of 92
aircraft.

   Thomas J. Usher was promoted from executive

   He succeeds Thomas C. Graham. The company's board voted Tuesday

   Usher, a native of Reading, was named to the heavy products post

<HEAD>American National Can Announces New Recycling Efforts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American National Can Co. has forged an agreement
with Du Pont Co. to recycle rigid plastic bottles that recyclers
often reject.
   The pact should go a long way toward resolving one of the
recycling industry's major problems: finding someone to use the
reconstituted product by guaranteeing a continuing supply.
   One of the big remaining obsticles to increasing the re-use of
plastics above the current rate of 1 percent to 2 percent is to
improve the sorting process to segregate the various kinds of
plastics, said Clifford Klotz, American National Can's vice
president and general manager for recycling.
   Now, plastic is hand-sorted at a Chicago area plant operated by
the Plastic Recycling Alliance, a joint venture between Du Pont and
Waste Management Inc.
   Researchers are trying to find a way to speed up this process,
Klotz said Tuesday.
   ``The economics (of plastic recycling) is not as good today as
it will be a year from now,'' he said.
   In addition to the plastics agreement, American National Can
also announced a pact with Waste Management of North America Inc.,
which will supply all types of presorted metal and glass
containers.
   American National Can will melt them down to form new containers
or sell the material to other manufacturers.
   Under both agreements, trash will go through a preliminary
presorting at the curbside when Waste Management picks it up.
   The metal and glass recycling alliance will begin next year when
when a final sorting and processing facility is completed in the
Chicago area.
   At first, Waste Management will provide trash from 140,000
homes.
   The company serves 2 million households in more than 250
communities nationwide, although recycling in many of these towns
is voluntary.
   Nonetheless, American National Can and Waste Management foresee
eventually extending the program beyond the Chicago area.
   ``These recycling efforts will be extended throughout the United
States and eventually throughout the world,'' said Jean-Pierre
Ergas, chief executive officer of American National Can.
   Klotz said that, except for plastic, much of the recycling pays
for itself through the value of the trash.
   Aluminum cans have been money-makers for years, he said.
   Steel-can recycling should pay for itself, Klotz said, and so
should glass if it's handled efficiently.
   He said it's too early to project the quantity of recyclable
materials the new pacts can be expected to generate.
   David Goeller, a spokesman for Environmental Action, said his
group ``is always in favor of re-use.''
   ``We applaud more recycling, but we also wold like to see less
use of some of these items to start with, particularly on the
plastic end,'' he said.
   Goeller said it's difficult to make a specific assessment of the
American National Can projects without knowing more about them.
   Environmental Action, headquartered in Washington, is a national
research and lobbying group.

   Without a short-term loan, the city of
Philadelphia will be forced to live day to day on cash receipts
until major property tax payments arrive in late February,
according to a city report.
   In an analysis of the city's cash condition, the Finance
Director's Office urged state and local political leaders Tuesday
to back its search for such a loan.
   ``The city would in this event be insolvent,'' the analysis
said. ``Such a condition of insolvency has never happened to a
major American city.''
   Two of the city's three major taxes - property and business
privilege - are due annually in the spring, and the city has
borrowed annually since 1972 to meet payroll and other obligations
until those funds arrived.
   A $375 million note offering was postponed Sept. 12 because it
failed to attract investors.
   The analysis said the offering was undercut by ``adverse
publicity, the lack of definitive public commitments at the state
and local levels to find a permanent correction, and the
corresponding high degree of uncertainty about Philadelphia's
fiscal future.''
   According to the analysis, five steps are needed to regain
access to the markets.
   -Pledges from key state and local leaders to ensure that
noteholders would be repaid.
   -Clarification from city Controller Jonathan A. Saidel of his
position on the need for seasonal cash-flow borrowing.
   -Demonstrated willingness by state and local leaders to find a
long-term solution to the city's underlying fiscal problems.
   -At least a minimal commitment from state and local banks to
back the notes.
   -Action by the state on one of six proposals that would enhance
the city's financial standing.
   The proposals that would need state approval include
longstanding requests for full state funding of state-mandated
human services programs, a significant advance on state funds the
city already is expected to get this fiscal year or state
guarantees on the notes.
   The other possibilities are passage of mandatory withholding of
the city's wage tax from the paychecks of an estimated 25,000 city
residents who work in the suburbs, passage of a local sales tax and
approval of deficit financing.
   The analysis also outlines various cash-saving steps it can take
itself without a short-term note, including freezes in hiring,
payments to the city pension fund and repayment of an illegal
real-estate transfer tax.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode said last week the city could save $122
million through such steps, delaying until Dec. 1 the date when it
would run out of cash.
   For a long-term solution to the city's financial ills, the
analysis restated proposals Goode's administration has pushed for
two years.
   The main elements still lacking, the analysis said, are a
permanent funding source for the regional mass-transit system; tax
reform and increased local taxes; and additional state aid, mostly
for mandated human services programs.

   The stock market opened slightly lower today,
unable to build upon the gains of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 3.71 points at
2,481.93 in the first half hour of trading. Losing issues narrowly
outnumbered gainers, with 478 declining, 420 advancing and 535
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.33 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Though oil prices continued to retreat today, the move had
little affect on the stock market. Analysts stressed that there are
few compelling reasons to buy equities and stressed that no clear
trend has emerged in stock trading.
   ``The market is basically lobbing around at the bottom,'' said
Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Wall Street was largely unaffected by a sharp drop overnight in
Tokyo, where the key Nikkei stock index plunged nearly 5 percent to
its lowest level in three years.
   MCA continued to trade actively, a day after it was disclosed
that the company is discussing a buyout with Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. MCA was up } at 54} on the Big Board and
helped generate some enthusiasm for other potential ``deal''
stocks.
   Among other actively traded issues, Pepsi was unchanged at 22;
Philip Morris was down \ at 44|, and Boeing was unchnaged at 40}.
Citicorp, which confirmed it was laying off 100 employees in its
leveraged buyout department, was down &rsqb; at 15&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
at 168.71, off 0.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index slipped 0.50 to 312.67.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.76 to
2,485.64
   Advancing issues only slightly outpaced decliners in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 770 up, 745

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders foresaw continued sluggish export demand for both corn
and soybeans. An expected bumper harvest also helped push soybean
prices lower.
   Wheat followed the lead of corn and soybean prices as traders
cautiously waited for the release of the Agriculture Department's
quarterly grain stocks report after Thursday's close.
   Analysts expect the USDA to report higher soybean and wheat
stocks and lower corn stocks than a year ago.
   The lower prices also reflected follow-through selling after
Tuesday's weak close in the corn and wheat markets.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to } cent lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.74\ a bushel; corn was
} cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $2.26} a bushel; oats
were 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with December at $1.12} a bushel;
soybeans were 2\ cents to 4{ cents lower with November at $6.14 a

   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures
were mostly lower in early trading.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October
at 78.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .10

cent to .53 cent lower with October at 54.27 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .27 cent to .50 cent lower with February at 56.20
cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower Tuesday and pork bellies were
mixed.

<TEXT>
   Foreign banks have been setting up shop on U.S.
soil in increasing numbers over the years, lending money to
corporations, investing in government securities, even accepting
deposits.
   In many cases, they've been competing head-on with
American-owned banks.
   Now, as many U.S. banks retrench abroad and struggle with a
slumping real estate market at home, some critics charge foreign
institutions are bullying their U.S. counterparts in a financial
free-for-all.
   They suggest foreign banks be bound by new controls. But others
say the current open-door policy best serves the American
consumers.
   Buoyed by the equal-treatment policies of the International
Banking Act of 1978, overseas bankers have expanded their American
operations by a startling 2,800 percent since the early 1970s. They
rushed in to help finance the federal deficit and make commercial
loans in a vast, diversified market that offered new horizons for
expansion.
   Meanwhile, American banks reined in their international lending
as some of their loans soured and capital considerations grew more
urgent.
   The 670 foreign-owned bank branches, agencies and subsidiaries
account for nearly 30 percent of all outstanding commercial or
business lending.
   At the end of last year, U.S. assets of foreign banks totaled
$735.7 billion, compared with $26.1 billion in 1972, according to
figures provided by the Federal Reserve. About 55 percent of those
assets are from Japanese institutions, the Fed said.
   Real estate developer Donald Trump knows first hand the global
power and importance of Japanese banks. He has been forced to knock
on the doors of several Japanese banks during his cash crunches
this year.
   In a recent report, the Nippon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's premier
financial newspaper, claimed Trump owes a third of his debts to
Japanese banks.
   Faramarz Damanpour, author of the recently published book ``The
Evolution of Foreign Banking Institutions in the United States,''
called the growing dependence on foreign banks alarming. He
suggests requiring a certain level of U.S. participation in foreign
banking operations.
   ``If we do not please the Japanese, then we are at their
mercy,'' said Damanpour, a James Madison University professor.
``The similarity can be to the OPEC oil.''
   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the Washington-based American
Bankers Association, says foreign banks often act in concert with
the fiscal policies of their home countries, not those of the
United States.
   As a result, they sometimes can draw on extra funds because of
lower reserve requirements, regulatory costs, and deposit insurance
premiums in many foreign lands, he said. ``The playing field is
tipped significantly in their favor.''
   But Lawrence R. Uhlick, executive director of the New York-based
Institute of International Bankers, says foreign banks also have
guidelines to follow.
   He noted that the Bank for International Settlements, which acts
as a bank for central banks of major industrialized countries,
adopted risk-based capital standards two years ago. The Swiss-based
bank also set a March 1993 deadline for banks to hold capital equal
to at least 8 percent of their loans and other assets, he said.
   Uhlick said foreign bnnks provide healthy competition in lending
and other banking services and additional financing to the U.S.
market. They also boost international trade, in part by financing
U.S. operations of businesses from their home countries, he said.
   ``A lot of people look at the size of the U.S. business that has
been done by banks around the world, and they draw from that the
conclusion that foreign banks are stealing U.S. business somehow,''
said James M. Stewart, general manager of Den Danske Bank, a Danish
company with offices in New York and Los Angeles.
   ``Really, that's not the case. What's happening is that banks
are bringing capital and a capacity to participate in transactions
that would not otherwise be completed.''
   Any effort to pass protectionist legislation will only backfire,
some say.
   ``Other markets may not remain open to American banks if the
U.S. restricts access of other countries' banks to its market,''
said Uhlick. ``I'd let the consumer decide how best their financial
services are going to be met.''
   Some bankers and lawmakers have called for deregulating the
entire U.S. banking system to unshackle both foreign and American
institutions. To develop a foundation to compete worldwide, they
say, U.S. banks must be given freedom to expand easily from state
to state and to do insurance and securities business that is now
off-limits to them.
   ``If you can't go where other individuals can go, if you can't
do what other individuals can do, that impedes your ability to
compete,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-Buffalo, N.Y., a member of the
House Task Force on International Competitiveness.
   One effort to rework the banking system is embodied in House
Bill 1992. It would allow creation of ``depository institution
holding companies'' that could provide banking, securities, or
insurance services though subsidiaries.
   While that may help, some banking experts say the problems
facing U.S. banks run much deeper.
   ``We are losing our respect in financial and capital markets,''
said Damanpour.
   He says that in the long term, Americans must improve their
educational system, rebuild the infrastructure, and abandon what he
views as an outmoded ethos of greed and easy living.

   Stock prices sank today, erasing the gains of
the previous session as the pace of trading quickened.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 35.14 points at
2,450.50 at midday. Losing issues outpaced gainers by about 13 to
4, with 1,009 declining, 311 advancing and 485 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 85.35 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street, against 73.45 million shares at the same time
Tuesday.
   Stock prices opened mixed before the drift lower gathered
momentum. A turnaround in the energy market, where oil price
resumed their move upward and the near-term crude contract again
traded above $38 a barrel, put pressure on stocks.
   Further, traders continued to be concerned about the economy and
the budget deficit. The lack of agreement on a budget-reduction
plan coupled with a 0.8 percent decline in durable goods orders in
August ``brings everything back into light that things are not that
good,'' said James Schroederade the effort to open channels of communication
between the military and civilians.
   Any armchair general is entitled to speculate about what
military actions the United States might take if the attempt to
starve Iraq out of Kuwait fails. Dugan, however, was no armchair
general. He was the real thing.
   Anything he said as Air Force chief of staff carried the weight
of an inside opinion, the musings of someone with access to
high-level planning. Even if Dugan's assessment that U.S. planes
would bomb Baghdad and specifically target Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein wasn't official, the damage had been done.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who fired Dugan, said that
discussion of likely military targets inside Iraq violates Pentagon
policy. Furthermore, Dugan may have disclosed classified
information about the size of U.S. forces in the gulf area.
   Despite the charges, however, it seems unlikely that Dugan
disclosed anything that Iraq had not considered already. Even a
layman would guess that the United States would rely heavily on air
strikes in a region where its ground troops are outnumbered.
   If the United States does resort to force, it also seems likely
that one of its primary objectives will be to cripple Iraq's war
machine and cut supply lines to Kuwait - all from the air if
possible.
   And finally, it should be no surprise that sending planes to gun
for Hussein is a possibility. After all, one of the objectives of
the bombing raid on Libya allegedly was to kill Moammar Gadhafi.
   Pentagon officials, chiefs of staff and high-ranking military
officers can't say that, however. For one thing, the president is
forbidden from sanctioning official assassinations. For another, it
is foolish for members of the U.S. military to discuss their
options in public. ...
   It's a bad ending for a fine career, but with that much
experience in how the military works, Dugan should have known
better.

   Sept. 21
   Bakersfield (Calif.) Californian on the firing of Gen. Michael
Dugan:
   In one respect, it is sad to see the distinguished military
career of former Air Force Chief of Staff Michael J. Dugan go down
in inglorious flames as a result of a single lapse of judgment. But
of all people, a four-star general should know better than to
discuss with the press specific targets in the event of war in the
Persian Gulf.
   All considered, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was justified in
firing General Dugan for thoughtless remarks that subsequently were
printed in the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post.
   Dugan told three reporters during a trip to Saudi Arabia that
the Joint Chiefs of Staff had concluded that the only effective
military option for driving Iraqi forces out of Kuwait was heavy
bombing of Baghdad to ``decapitate'' the senior Iraqi leadership,
making Saddam Hussein, his family and palace guards primary
targets.
   Any buck private has the common sense not to publicize battle
plans. By discussing possible targets, the general has warned
Saddam Hussein to fortify the sites. He'll likely place American
hostages in targeted areas. ...
   It's hard to believe that a ranking officer, molded by 32 years
of military discipline, would succumb to loose talk as the nation
prepares for possible war. ... The general had to be silenced.

   The Mesa (Ariz.) Tribune on David Souter:
   A reporter asked former Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger
if it is proper for the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask Supreme
Court nominee David Souter about abortion. Burger was emphatic: not
only would it be improper to ask, it would be improper for Souter
to answer.
   Such a remark is not surprising coming from a Nixon-appointed
conservative. But Burger is correct. The committee's duty is to
oversee the selection of a judge, not a politician. If the senators
insist on unveiling Souter's feelings on abortion, they not only
will flout the intent of the court, they will lay a distressing
groundwork for selecting future jurists.
   The contrast between Souter and those measuring his character
are stark indicators that we don't want a politician on the bench.
Compare the quiet dignity of Souter to his inquisitors. (He) has
lived a life of scholarly seclusion, driven by a passion for
history and the law.
   The pro-choice members of the judiciary committee have an
opportunity to teach the American people the distinction between
the court and the Congress. The two have different jobs.
Politicians create laws. Judges interpret them. The callings are
different, and so too must be their approach to the law.
   (Committee chairman Joseph) Biden wasted little time getting to
abortion. He danced on the periphery with questions on civil rights
and the implied rights of privacy - the foundation on which Roe vs.
Wade is built.
   But Souter wouldn't budge. He told the senator repeatedly it
would be improper for him to reveal his inner feelings about a case
that might soon be before him.
   If we choose judges based on how they'll vote on the hot issues
of the day, we compromise the independence of the judiciary.

   Valley News, Lebanon, N.H., on politicians:
   Polling around the country earlier this summer showed rising
disaffection with the parties themselves and incumbents generally.
...
   And there are other indications of disenchantment with the
status quo. In Oklahoma, voters agreed to limit the terms of state
legislators.
   Polling by The Washington Post and ABC News suggests that the
electorate may be remarkably willing to shop around this fall for
congressional candidates, undermining the theory tha the enhanced
powers of modern incumbency are creating the so-called ``Permanent
Congress.''...
   First and most obviously it's axiomatic that people vote their
pocketbook. As the economy slumps and state budget woes rise,
members of the political establishment may begin to pay for the
prosperity of the '80s that rendered their incumbency almost
unassailable.

   Oil prices rallied late this morning on fears of
war in the Persian Gulf, wiping out an early decline that was
attributed to a report of higher supplies of gasoline and heating
oil.
   ``We're hearing rumors that Saddam wants the U.S. out of Saudi
Arabia within 48 hours,'' said trader Brian Tagler of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. ``That's what's causing the rally.''
   Light sweet crude was trading up 27 cents at $37.80 per barrel
for November delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange
shortly before noon. Other crude contract months were mixed.
   Earlier today, oil had fallen more than $1 per barrel as traders
responded to the release on Tuesday evening of American Petroleum
Institute statistics that showed supplies of the refined petroleum
products had risen.
   At the opening, the market was paying less attention to a U.N.
action on Tuesday night authorizing an extension of the embargo of
Iraq and Kuwait to cover airways as well as the sea. Some traders
had thought that move would push prices up this morning, but oil
opened lower in apparent response to the weekly API report.
   Gasoline and heating oil also fell in early trading today, but
heating oil rallied along with crude oil around midday.
   Heating oil moved up .30 cent to $1.015 per gallon on October
contracts shortly before noon. But the October contract for
unleaded gasoline was down 2.45 cents at 99.60 cents per gallon.
   Later months were mixed for both refined products.
   Natural gas prices were also mixed late this morning, with
November contracts trading just before noon at $1.93 per 1,000
cubic feet, the same as Tuesday's close.
   Traders viewed the markets' decline early in the morning as a
continuation of Tuesday's dip, which followed a dramatic surge in
prices on Monday.
   When crude oil soared briefly above $39 per barrel Monday,
people on the floor of the exchange were saying $40 was their next
target.
   ``We haven't heard talk of that lately, but all you need is some
war rhetoric and that talk will come right back,'' said Sal
Gilbertie, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The API report that was moving the market on its open showed
that crude imports and stocks fell last week, as did imports and
production of gasoline and distillates, which include home heating
oil.
   Refinery capacity was also down last week, although the nation's
stockpiles of gasoline and distillates were higher, API said in its
weekly statistics.
   Crude imports were at 5.7 million barrels per day, down from 6.0
million barrels daily a week earlier but up from 5.6 million
barrels a day a year ago. Crude oil stocks stood at 364.0 million
barrels, down from 369.8 million barrels a week earlier but up from
330.9 million barrels a year earlier.
   Gasoline imports were down to 215,000 barrels per day, from
282,000 barrels per day a week earlier and 313,000 barrels per day
a year earlier. Gasoline stocks were higher, at 222.3 million
barrels, compared with 217.0 million barrels a week earlier and
219.2 million barrels a year earlier.
   Distillate imports were down to 220,000 barrels per day, from
394,000 barrels per day a week earlier and 278,000 barrels per day
a year earlier. Distillate stockpiles were up to 136.5 million
barrels, compared with 133.3 million barrels a week earlier and
122.8 million barrels a year earlier.
   Gasoline production was down to 7.2 million barrels per day,
from 7.4 million barrels a week earlier and 7.3 million barrels per
day a year earlier. Distillate production was down to 2.9 million
barrels per day, from 3.0 million barrels, the figure both a week
earlier and a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   The Canadian Auto Workers union today set an Oct.
10 strike deadline for reaching a new labor agreement with General
Motors Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary.
   CAW members last weekend ratified a new contract with Ford of
Canada after a six-day strike by about 12,800 workers. It's
expected the union will use that contract as a pattern for
negotiations with General Motors of Canada Ltd., which has about
36,000 workers covered by the CAW national contract.
   CAW President Bob White said today a strike next month at GM's
12 facilities in Canada is possibile.
   ``We should not fall into a false sense of security,'' White
said.
   GM has said it wants to shut its Scarborough, Ontario, van
assembly plant in 1992 and cut 700 jobs from its Windsor, Ontario,
trim plant. White said negotiations with GM would focus on saving
jobs from those two factories.
   ``The agreement reached at Ford is an expensive proposition,''
said Rick Curd, vice president of personnel for GM of Canada. The
company, he added today, wants improvements in
cost-competitiveness, workplace flexibility and worker attendance.
   In the United States, meantime, United Auto Workers union
members at GM plants today continued voting on a proposed
three-year agreement reached Sept. 17. That pact appeared headed to
an overwhelming ratification margin. Voting should be completed by
Sunday.

   American allies raised new questions today
concerning a fund-raising campaign launched by President Bush to
collect the billions of dollars needed in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   As officials representing more than 20 nations prepared to hold
an organizational meeting of the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination
Group, it was clear that the allies who were expected to put up the
cash had a number of objections to the outline of the effort
unveiled by Bush on Tuesday.
   The disputes ranged from such basic issues as how much money
should be contributed to which countries should receive the
assistance. There were also debates over what mechanisms to use to
disburse the funds.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady expressed the hope today that
the various questions could be resolved, telling global finance
ministers in a speech that they needed to forge ``a united economic
front'' against Saddam Hussein.
   ``The economic strength represented by all of you in this room
must be mobilized to demonstrate collective resolve and make clear
our intention not to yield to aggression,'' Brady said.
   Officials said that while the United States was pushing for more
than $14 billion in assistance for the frontline states of Turkey,
Egypt and Jordan and other hard-hit countries, some European
countries were insisting that a much smaller amount of around $9
billion was all that was needed.
   Saudi Arabia reportedly was objecting to including Jordan as a
beneficiary country until Jordan moved more forcefully to close its
borders to trade with Iraq.
   President Bush put forward his proposal for the crisis
coordination group during an address Tuesday to the opening
sessions of the 154-nation International Monetary Fund and its
sister organization, the World Bank.
   While officials of the large donor countries indicated general
support for a coordinating group, they let it be known that many of
the details remained to be worked out.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major told reporters
that it was possible that a working group session today would be
unable to resolve all the outstanding issues and would end up
bucking the dispute to a later meeting of finance ministers.
   ``It is clearly sensible for the world to get together and
determine what should be the elements of assistance, how much it
should be and how that should be divided among the donor nations,''
Major said.
   Officials of Japan, which already has pledged $4 billion, more
than any other country outside of oil-rich Persian Gulf nations,
indicated they had questions as well on how the informal
coordinating council would work.
   ``President Bush gave one idea. Whether it will go ahead will
depend on the response of the countries involved,'' Japanese
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters late Tuesday.
   In his speech, Bush noted the refugee crisis as well as
unemployment problems and serious economic disruptions resulting
from rising oil prices.
   ``This staggering burden, which is pressing upon those most
seriously affected countries, calls for a generous response from
the world community,'' the president told the finance officials.
   ``The political leadership of the U.N. must be matched by the
economic leadership of the IMF and World Bank,'' he said.
   The United States has been trying for a month to mobilize
financial support to pay the cost of the U.S. military buildup in
the Persian Gulf and to compensate countries harmed by the U.N.
trade embargo against Iraq.
   The administration fears that the sanctions against Iraq could
begin to unravel without substantial economic assistance.
   The United States has obtained pledges of $20 billion from the
allies, divided equally between support for the military effort and
assistance for the three countries hardest hit by the turmoil -
Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, the so-called frontline states.
   However, a West German official, who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity, said the United States now was seeking
$14.5 billion in aid for the frontline states, up from an initial
estimate of $10.5 billion earlier this month.
   The German official said some European countries questioned
whether this amount overstated the need. He said his country also
would like to see the donor pool widened to include such nations as
Switzerland and Sweden.
   In a fact sheet released by the White House, the countries
expected to participate with the United States in the crisis
coordination group included Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and South Korea.
   In addition, representatives of the 12-nation European Community
were being included in the discussions along with the Gulf
Cooperation Council of Persian Gulf countries.
   The administration received assurances Monday from
policy-setting panels of the IMF and the World Bank that both
agencies stood ready to accelerate their lending activities in
order to cushion the economic fallout from the doubling of world
oil prices.
   While the administration has focused its fundraising efforts
primarily on Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, officials of the IMF and the
World Bank say they expect to provide aid to many other Third World
nations that have been hurt by rising oil prices, the loss of
export markets and a flood of refugees from Iraq and Kuwait.

   Prosecutors seeking a stiff prison term for
Michael Milken released their long-awaited arguments to the
sentencing judge today, urging her to concentrate on the convicted
financier's ``sweeping and serious crimes.''
   The 200-page memorandum to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood
exhorted her to pay scant attention to Milken's good deeds and
instead consider evidence that he was a systematic crook.
   ``The court's sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess
great wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or
their money will insulate them from certain and serious
punishment,'' said the document signed by Acting U.S. Attorney
Roger Hayes.
   It was released a day after Milken's high-powered legal team
released their own recommendations to the judge, who is scheduled
to pronounce sentence Monday on the most celebrated defendant in
the securities fraud scandals that rocked Wall Street in the 1980s.
   The defense lawyers have urged the judge to weigh Milken's
generosity and philanthropy and spare him from prison. They suggest
alternatively that Milken be ordered to work full-time with youths
in the drug-plagued ghettos of Los Angeles.
   He faces a maximum 28 years in prison on six felony counts, to
which he earlier pleaded guilty, including conspiracy, securities
fraud and tax violations.
   ``His good works, however commendable, should not shield him
from incarceration,'' the prosecution memorandum said. ``Milken is
guilty of sweeping and serious crimes. He should be sentenced to a
substantial term of imprisonment.''
   The prosecution cannot recommend a specific prison term, and
Wood has wide discretion in passing sentence. But many legal
experts expect the 44-year-old ex-trader of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. junk bonds to do time.
   Wood ordered the release of sentencing memorandums earlier this
week because of the enormous public interest in the Milken case.
But she instructed the two sides to edit the documents to delete
incriminating references to Milken associates.
   Milken abandoned claims of innocence in April and agreed to a
plea bargain that spared him from a much wider indictment and
assumes his cooperation with prosecutors in other probes.
   But in sentencing, the defense has opposed the prosecution's
effort to portray Milken as a conniving criminal mastermind who
committed more crimes than he had admitted. In their recommendation
to Wood, they asked her to view Milken's transgressions as an
aberration in an otherwise exemplary life.
   ``Michael should be sentenced based on the offenses to which he
pleaded guilty,'' the defense papers said. ``He should not be
sentenced for crimes that he did not commit. He should not be
sentenced on charges for which the government expressly has
foregone prosecution in return for his guilty plea.''
   Lead defense attorney Arthur Liman wrote that hundreds of
letters from Milken relatives, friends and clients portrayed him as
a benevolent capitalist, hardworking family man, and a ``person of
great conscience, compassion and charity who has always been
generous with his time, money and spirit.''
   The lawyer also asserted Milken already has been punished
severely by relentless public scrutiny, payment of a record $600
million in fines and penalties and a bleak future fighting civil
lawsuits.
   ``Michael Milken is a changed person. He will be tormented for
the remainder of his life by the realization that his family was
devastated, his reputation destroyed and his life's work tainted by
virtue of his having committed these acts,'' Liman wrote.
   The defense also denied suggestions that Milken played any role
in the decline of the nation's savings and loans, which were among
some of his most prominent clients. On the contrary, S&amp;L holdings
of junk bonds below investment grade were among their most
profitable investments, the defense contended.
   It also rejected allegations of insider trading against Milken,
including trades of securities in Caesar's World, Viacom, Republic
Airlines and Lorimar, noting that those charges had been refuted
earlier.
   Milken's guilty plea did not include any counts related to
trading on the basis of nonpublic information. The defense also
minimized the extent of his association with Ivan Boesky, the
convicted inside trader who was Milken's chief accuser.
   ``Indeed, the government even secured an indictment of Mr.
Milken on some of the transactions for which it now acknowledges
that it does not have - and never did have - any evidence of Mr.
Milken's involvement,'' the defense documents said.

   A former board member of the failed Silverado
savings and loan association who refused to testify at Neil Bush's
conflict-of-interest hearing has changed his mind and will testify
Thursday, officials said today.
   Florian Barth was to have been the third witness at the Office
of Thrift Supervision hearing that opened Tuesday, but he refused
to appear.
   Today, government counsel Stephen Hershkowitz told
Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson that Barth had decided
to testify and would appear before the hearing Thursday morning.
Davidson on Tuesday had said he would sign a subpoena to force
Barth's appearance if he did not appear voluntarily.
   Tuesday's hearing was highlighted by former Silverado Chairman
Michael Wise invoking the Fifth Amendment 14 times.
   Another Silverado executive, meanwhile, testified the thrift's
board of directors knew of Bush's business relationship with
Kenneth Good when it granted Good a no-collateral, $900,000 line of
credit.
   The testimony came Tuesday during the hearing on whether to bar
Bush from the financial industry for his actions as a Silverado
director.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision has alleged that Bush,
as a Silverado director, improperly voted on loans and credit for
Good and Bill Walters, both of whom contributed to Bush's oil and
gas exploration company.
   The two businessmen defaulted on more than $132 million in loans
from the thrift. Silverado collapsed in late 1988 at a cost to
taxpayers of $1 billion.
   Today, attorneys were to re-examine defense witness Geoffrey C.
Hazard Jr., a Yale law professor who says Bush acted legally when
dealing with Good and Walters.
   President Bush's 35-year-old son did not attend the opening
session. He is scheduled as the final witness at the hearing,
expected to end Thursday.
   Bush could have avoided a hearing by agreeing not to dispute the
charges, as other S&amp;L officials have done. By fighting the
government, he has taken the case into a rare public forum.
   As the hearing opened, Silverado's former chief executive
officer, Wise, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Davidson let Wise testify in the judge's chambers to be ``spared
the ordeal of going through a futile gesture of taking the Fifth.''
But in the chambers, Wise still took the Fifth 14 times.
   He gave only his name and Wichita, Kan., address, according to a
transcript later released. He wouldn't comment as he left the
courthouse.
   Another witness, Russell Murray, a former Silverado executive
vice president who reviewed the 1986 proposal for a $900,000 line
of credit for Good International Inc., testified he did not recall
anyone questioning it even though Good and Bush had a business
relationship.
   He said he discussed the request with Bush, Good and Wise, and
then wrote a memo to the thrift's directors about the relationship
before they approved the line of credit.
   But he said he did not have all the details of the relationship
and that he would have asked for a legal opinion if he had had all
the facts.
   Last week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued Bush and
other former Silverado directors for $200 million. The lawsuit,
which also named Wise and Barth, alleged gross negligence on the
part of Silverado directors contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.

   President Bush may be willing to compromise on
his call for a capital gains tax cut, the main sticking point in
talks to slash the federal deficit, Republican members of Congress
who met with the president said today.
   Instead of reducing the rate on capital gains taxes, Bush might
accept other incentives to economic growth, the lawmakers said.
   ``He might be willing to look at alternatives in the growth
area,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., as he and
other GOP lawmakers left the White House.
   But Bush and GOP lawmakers warned that without Democratic
concessions at ongoing budget talks, no deal would be reached in
time to avoid $85 billion in federal spending cuts that the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will impose on Monday.
   Bush, at a political fund-raiser today in Akron, Ohio,
criticized congressional Democrats, saying ``it's their fault for
holding up getting a budget agreement.''
   ``We will continue to press hard for incentives for capital
investment,'' Bush said. However, he did not further discuss his
longstanding insistence on a capital gains tax reduction as part of
any budget agreement.
   Without an agreement by Monday, the start of the new budget
year, the government faces the possibility of mass disruptions of
services and furloughs of many of the two million federal civilian
employees.
   ``It can be avoided if they do what they should,'' Bush told
reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Ohio. ``It's the
Congress. I would now say the Democrats in Congress have not come
forward with a package.''
   ``There are a couple of points now where the Democrats need to
move,'' said Dole. He said he was referring to economic incentives.
   Dole and House Republican Leader Robert Michel already have said
they would be willing to put aside Bush's proposal to cut the
capital gains tax rate in order to get a budget agreement.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2 House Republican, said the
incentives Bush might be willing to accept include tax breaks for
businesses to encourage research and investment, and a proposal to
establish so-called enterprise zones. The zones would provide tax
breaks for businesses in poor urban and rural areas.
   ``While he's going to be very flexible and he's willing to look
at a Democratic offer, he wants part of this final agreement to be
a growth package,'' Gingrich said.
   ``He's willing to negotiate every item that's been advanced,''
said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., when asked if Bush was now ready
to bargain on the question of capital gains.
   Both Michel and Dole said they would be willing to put the
capital gains cut in order to get an agreement to slash the budget
deficit over five years by $500 billion. Asked by reporters about
the GOP defections, Bush refused to answer.
   Earlier, negotiators for Congress and the White House claimed
some progress early today in their talks.
   ``I think we made some headway,'' Dole told reporters after the
eight-hour, closed-door session. Asked for details, he refused,
saying, ``I don't want to blow the whole thing up.''
   ``It's still going to be tough'' to get an agreement enacted
into law before the Oct. 1 start of the new budget year, said
Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management
and Budget.
   Asked whether the Bush administration was ready to drop its
demand for a cut in taxes on capital gains, Darman scoffed, ``Don't
be ridiculous.''
   Just before the bargaining resumed Tuesday evening, Michel
signaled a willingness to drop the capital-gains cut, which has
been a top priority of President Bush since his 1988 campaign.
   For his money, Michel said, ``the doggone price (of a
capital-gains cut) is too steep.''
   Democratic leaders, who have been resisting a capital-gains cut
because 80 percent of the direct benefit would go to those with
incomes over $100,000 a year, have insisted they will go along only
if taxes on the wealthy are raised in some other fashion to pay for
the cut.
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments,
now are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income. Bush says they
should be given a lower rate to encourage investment.
   Michel's Senate counterpart, Dole, earlier had expressed his own
misgivings about sticking to the capital-gains demand so long that
it threatened a deficit agreement. The reduction is still a sound
idea, he said, ``but you just can't keep everything on hold'' in an
attempt to win it.
   The government's financial woes are complicated by the fact only
five days before the new year, none of the 13 annual appropriations
bills has been enacted.
   The Democratic-controlled House Appropriations approved a bill
Tuesday aimed at giving negotiators 20 days past the Oct. 1
deadline to write a deficit-cutting plan.
   The ``continuing resolution'' approved by the panel, with all
but one Republican dissenting, would continue spending, generally
at current levels, until Oct. 20 and block any of the scheduled
across-the-board spending cuts until after that date.
   Bush repeated his vow to veto any legislation that delayed the
spending cuts without a long-term deficit-cutting agreement.

<HEAD>Flamboyant Australian Financier Resigns from Company He Founded</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Alan Bond resigned Wednesday
as chairman and director of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the brewing
company he founded that's fallen victim to financial problems.
   The resignation was expected. Bond had said in July he would
step down to appease the company's creditors, who are owed an
estimated $6 billion.
   Bond Corp. said in a statement that two other directors, Tony
Oates and Peter Mitchell, had also resigned, while director Peter
Lucas will become the new chairman.
   Bond, Oates and Mitchell will act as consultants until the
company's proposed brewery sale and capital restructuring is
completed. A spokesman said the three would play no further role in
the company ``in the direct management sense'' after the
restructuring and sale are finished.
   Bond still retains a controlling interest in Bond Corp. through
his private company, Dallhold Investments.
   Bond Corp., which reported a loss of 979 million Australian
dollars, or $815 million, for the 1988-89 financial year, has had
to sell assets to reduce its crippling debt levels.
   The resignation ends a long fall for the brash, flamboyant Bond,
who rose rapidly from humble roots by investing in land around
Perth and taking advantage of rapidly rising property values.
   He emigrated to Perth from Britain with his father, quit school
at age 14 and took a job with a sign-painting company. When things
didn't work out, he and his father started a competitor, Nu-Signs,
that provided the cash for some of his later deals.
   With a flair for picking the best real estate development sites
and promoting them, he was successful enough to make his first
million by 1969 at age 29. He took advantage of eager bankers
peddling expensive credit, particularly after Australia's financial
deregulation in 1983, and a stock market full of hungry investors.
   At its peak, Bond Corp. Holdings had interests in brewing,
media, natural resources and property. Its best known U.S. business
is G. Heileman Brewing Co., a La Crosse, Wis.-based company he
bought in 1987 for $1.3 billion.
   Bond rode out the 1987 stock market crash on the cash-generating
strength of his beer businesses.
   But the man who built a fortune by making the most of borrowed
funds has been plagued by heavy debts, rising interest rates and
bad business decisions.
   The combination alienated his bankers and creditors, put his
Australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to
sell assets ranging from a Hong Kong development office to a coal
mine.
   Unlike business rival Robert Holmes a Court, who died recently
from a heart attack, Bond maintained a high public profile. He
probably is best known for financing the Australian sailing team's
stunning triumph over the United States in the 1983 America's Cup
race.
   Only three years ago, he bought Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
from Sotheby's for a record $53.9 million, a sale that the auction
house helped him finance. In March, he sold the painting for an
undisclosed amount amid reports he had taken a loss.
   Bond's resignation does come a bit earlier than expected. He had
said he would resign once European and Britis bond holders had
accepted a Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. buyback offer. The offer has
yet to be accepted.

<HEAD>Symbolic Strikes Warn Government As Privatization Starts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vendors across the country went on
brief symbolic strikes Wednesday to protest government plans to
sell their shops in auctions.
   The expected sale will be the beginning of a comprehensive
privatization process, the cornerstone of the ongoing economic
reform aimed at transforming the state-owned system of command
economy into a Western-style market mechanism.
   The heads of the federal government and the Czech and Slovak
republics plan to meet Thursday with President Vaclav Havel in the
Moravian city of Kromeriz, 180 miles east of Prague, to complete
work on the wording of the privatization law.
   The law must then go to parliament for approval.
   In the first round of what the government dubbed ``small
privatization,'' original owners may reclaim shops confiscated
after the Communists seized power in 1948 and nationalized private
property.
   Shops and small enterprises not claimed by former owners will
then be offered either to their employees or auctioned off to the
highest bidder.
   While an outsider will have to pay for the shop within seven
days of the purchase, a current employee will be given five years
to pay up to 50 percent of the price.
   This measure is designed to give vendors incentive to take over
their shops and to compensate for the lack of cash available to buy
enterprises outright.
   Vendors have protested the provision, demanding a clear first
priority on shops to be sold off.
   ``If a guy comes to the auction and puts half a million crowns
on the table, there is no way I can compete with him even if I have
state credit. I can never handle a transaction worth that much
money,'' said Vitezslav Klement, a vegetable vendor in Prague's
working class district of Smichov.
   ``Shops to the vendors, not money-changers and Communist
Mafia,'' read a sign across an antiques shop window Wednesday.
   Shops shut down for anything between five minutes to an hour in
Wednesday's protest strike against the privatization laws.
   Large savings were exceptional in Czechoslovakia's centrally
planned economy, where monthly wages averaged 3,200 crowns, or
about $200.
   Those who thrived on the black market and other components of
the ``shadow economy'' tolerated by Communists have saved millions,
often in convertible currencies stashed in Western banks.
   Shop vendors claim the auctions would put an abrupt end to the
already poor network of food and services, with the new owners
likely to switch to the sale of electronics and other consumer
goods that turn a fast profit.
   The government says the most important thing is to privatize the
economy as quickly as possible. The government of the Czech
republic wants ``small privatization'' completed by Dec. 31.
   ``It's not so important who gets the actual shop. What matters
is the earliest possible occurrence of private ownership, without
which a free society cannot exist,'' the Mlada Fronta daily, which
is known for its support of the reforms of Finance Minister Vaclav
Klaus, said Wednesday.
   Privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural
sector is expected to start in early 1991 when the legislative
framework giving access to foreign capital is ready and prices are
decontrolled.

   A rich vault of movies and television tapes, and
studios with which to make more, apparently lured Japanese
electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Cois talking with, but
would not comment further.
   If it purchases MCA, Matsushita also would acquire studios where
it could introduce its professional products, Petersik said.
   If the company makes the match, it will add to already enormous
holdings.
   Since 1918, when 23-year-old Konosuke Matsushita left his
employer to push the electrical switch he had invented, the
Matsushita empire has mushroomed to include nearly 500 related
firms operating in 36 countries.
   With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric is

<TEXT>
   
   NEW YORK - The way skeptics tell it, the modern day R. H. Macy &amp;
Co. story wouldn't be fit for a feel-good Hollywood film. The
retailer, they say, may need something like divine intervention, if
not another miracle on 34th Street, to shoulder a heavy debt burden
while losing support from retail revenue. Not so, say executives of
the department store chain. They acknowledge that Christmas 1990
won't go down as one of the merrier holidays in history for the
industry. But Macy's can survive a consumer spending slump and will
prosper again, they say.

<DATELINE>READING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meridian Bancorp Inc. plans to boost its
loan-loss reserves by $75 million and shed its credit card and
title insurance businesses amid signs of a weakening economy.
   The bank holding company said the moves would allow it to focus
on and expand its core banking businesses.
   Meridian said it expects to announce next month a net loss of
$35 million to $39 million for the quarter ending Sunday, or about
86 cents to 96 cents per share. During last year's third quarter,
Meridian made $22.5 million, or 56 cents a share.
   Most of the loss would stem from the addition to loan-loss
reserves and a charge of $15 million to $17.5 million related to
the sale of the title operations, Meridian said.
   ``We expect to return to normal levels of profitability in the
fourth quarter, to be profitable for all of 1990 and to continue
the payment of dividends at current levels,'' said Samuel A.
McCullough, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Meridian said it had re-evaluated its loan portfolios in
response to the weakening economy in general and the real estate
sector in particular.
   The reserve for possible loan losses will be increased to about
$165 million, or about 2 percent of loans outstanding.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. will arrange the sale of the title
operations, which had losses of $7.3 million for the six months
ending June 30.
   The company decided to sell its $300 million portfolio of credit
card receivables because of high overhead, potential legislative
restraints and the need for costly technology, McCullough said.
   Meridian also said it would convert $300 million of indirect
automobile loan receivables to marketable securities to improve its
capital ratios and reduce reliance on external funding.

   Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet on Wednesday
announced an emergency aid program intended to curtail the wave of
demonstrations and truck hijackings by farmers protesting
low-priced meat imports.
   The centerpiece of the program will be a $270 million (1.4
billion franc) fund to assist farmers in debt because of foreign
competition or a prolonged drought in France.
   Special protection would be given farmers over the age of 55.
Nallet said the government would seek to ensure they are not put
out of business for non-payment of debts.
   Earlier in the day, riot police protecting Premier Michel Rocard
hurled tear gas grenades at protesting farmers who pelted the
officers with eggs, tomatoes and bottles.
   In the town of Valence, 500 sheep farmers protested outside a
fairgrounds where Rocard was to address a communications forum.
   About 1,000 police officers blocked the protesters from
entering. Officers used tear gas grenades after being pelted.
   Some farmers tried to drive tractors through the barriers, while
others set fire to tires to block the entrance to a local
government building.
   Rocard, who flew to the fairgrounds by helicopter, said in his
speech that the protesters hurt their own cause by giving
themselves a bad image and complicating efforts to aid their
industry.
   In recent weeks, angry French farmers have staged dozens of
demonstrations nationwide and hijacked numerous livestock trucks
carrying imported animals. Hundreds of cows and sheep have been
killed, in some cases burned alive, during the hijackings.

   The stock market staged a broad decline today,
erasing the gains of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 32.17 points at
2,453.47 an hour before the closing bell. Losers outnumbered
gainers by nearly 4 to 1 with 1,110 issues declining, 357 advancing
and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 134.36 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices opened mixed before the drift lower gathered
momentum. The market was pressured by higher prices in the energy
pits, where the near-term crude contract climbed back above $38 per
barrel.
   But Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Gruntal Financial
Inc., cautioned that what's burdening the stock market is more
complex than just rising oil prices. ``We've had some relief in the
upward pressure on energy prices, but we've had no relief in the .
. . war talk.''
   Further, traders continued to be concerned about the economy and
the budget deficit. The lack of agreement on a budget-reduction
plan coupled with a 0.8 percent decline in durable goods orders in
August ``brings everything back into light that things are not that
good,'' said James Schroeder, an analyst at MMS International in
Chicago.
   Money-center bank stocks were hard hit, and one trader noted
that the market would be hard pressed to extend Tuesday's rally
without an upturn in the banking sector.
   Among bank issues traded on the Big Board, Citicorp, which
confirmed it was laying off 100 employees in its leveraged buyout

<HEAD>Can Legendary Retailer Withstand Slump?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To those who think debt is a dirty word, the
modern day R. H. Macy &amp; Co. story wouldn't be fit for a feel-good
Hollywood film.
   A number of outsiders believe the 132-year-old retailer's future
is more precarious now - on the eve of an expectedly bleak
Christmas shopping season - than at any time since it went private
in 1986.
   Macy's, some skeptics say, might need something like divine
intervention to shoulder its heavy debt burden while losing support
from retail revenue.
   Not so, say Macy's executives. They acknowledge Christmas 1990
won't go down as one of the merrier holidays in history. But a
consumer spending slump won't put Macy's on the ropes because the
retailer is ready for it, they say.
   ``We would feel very positive other than the fact that it is a
very soft economy out there,'' Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in an interview at the retailer's
headquarters atop the Manhattan flagship immortalized in the movie
``Miracle on 34th Street.''
   ``It's hard to be euphoric when the economy is this lousy so I
wouldn't describe my attitude as euphoric. But I have never felt
better about our organization . . .,'' Finkelstein said.
   He was joined in the interview by the two other members of his
management troika: Mark S. Handler, president and chief operating
officer, and Myron E. Ullman, executive vice president and chief
financial officer.
   Inventories are $400 million below last year's bloated level and
the year-to-year expense increase has been shaved to 1 percent,
Finkelstein said, noting the retailer has planned for sales to be
flat or even a bit lower than last year's. Expenses rose 7{ percent
in 1989 from 1988.
   Outsiders aren't as confident. Macy's has been begging for
business by hyping merchandise at reduced prices. This suggests the
company is desperate for sales to generate cash needed to cover
payments on debts incurred in its $3.74 billion leveraged buyout
and afterward, say analysts - who aren't privy to Macy's inside
information.
   Just as the back-to-school season was starting, Macy's
advertisements for special price breaks on children's clothing
blared over the airwaves and leaped from newspapers.
   In September - typically a transitional time in retailing when
stores gear up for the climax of their selling years - Macy's
advertised a series of sales on bedding, women's clothing,
accessories, fine jewelry, oriental rugs, etc.
   Merchandise also is marked down without fanfare. Macy's makes a
habit of hosting unannounced sale events, possibly to encourage
shoppers to stop by regularly to see what's on sale, according to
Kurt Barnard, publisher of a New York-based retailing newsletter.
   Consultants contend Macy's obsession with sales has caused the
retailer to crowd its promotional calendar.
   This compounds the problem of ``sale syndrome,'' an irksome
phenomenon for retailers caused by customers who have grown so
accustomed to markdowns that they almost never expect to pay full
price anymore.
   Finkelstein disagreed and said the retailer has curbed its
promotional activity - especially compared to last year when stores
fell over each other marking down merchandise. The price war was
started last year by Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied U.S.
department store chains, which succumbed to bankruptcy court in
January.
   Macy's has 10 percent fewer promotions this year than last and
conducts fewer one-day sales, Finkelstein said. He blasted
predictions that this Christmas Macy's must slash prices and push
merchandise as aggressively as it did a year ago.
   ``There is absolutely no reason we have to trash ourselves in
spite of what know-nothing, uninformed observers say,'' he fumed.
   Fiesty Finkelstein clearly has no patience with speculation that
he thinks lacks facts. He said reports criticizing Macy's for
everything from sloppy shopkeeping to tardy bill-paying practices
are unfair.
   ``I'm convinced that most of the people who trash our stores
either haven't been in them, don't shop them or don't know what the
hell is going on,''he said.
   He is annoyed that more mention isn't made of positive
developments.
   Business is going better in Texas and Florida than elsewhere in
the country, for instance, while Macy's Bullock's Inc. chain has
had strong business without the need for power-packed promoting, he
said.
   Macy's gets high marks for keeping interested parties up to
date. A few months ago, senior Macy's executives huddled with
vendors and other creditors to provide evidence of its bill-paying
ability.
   An executive with a women's apparel manufacturer, which supplies
large volumes to Macy-owned department stores, confirmed the
retailer pays promptly. The executive, speaking on condition of
anomymity, said the trade lately has more faith in Macy's.
   ``All of us are feeling more comfortable than we were three or
four months ago,'' he said. ``Everyone has always felt that the
people who run Macy's were among the most outstanding retail
executives in the country. The question was had they bitten off
more than they could chew?''
   Some of the concern in the trade and financial community
subsided after Macy's made it clear it was trimming its annual
interest bill of $595 million. At about 10 percent of sales, Macy's
interest tab is one of the highest in the industry.
   Macy's long-term debt amounts to $4.8 billion. At peak times
during the year, Macy's total debt load is about $5.6 billion,
Ullman said.
   Macy's used some of the $15 million it obtained by selling a 1
percent equity stake in August to buy back a portion of the $1.6
billion of its outstanding junk bonds. Further bond buybacks are
planned, taking the opportunity to cheaply retire debt that
currently is selling at substantial discounts of around 50 cents on
the dollar and lower.
   Finkelstein said Macy's will consider selling up to 20 percent
of the company and use the proceeds to cut interest expenses. The
odds are good that a stake of some size will be sold in the next
three to six months, he said.
   But Macy's has no intention of parting with retail assets. It is
exploring more possible sales of non-retail holdings, such as real
estate, Finkelstein said.
   Doubting Thomases don't believe Macy's merchandising clout,
strong market position and consumer identification will
automatically spare it from misery if Christmas is as bad as
doomsters foresee.
   Forecasts of operating profit, or income before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, have been scaled back for the six
months ending Jan. 31. But estimates still are well above the
dismal $416 million Macy's had in operating profit in the same
period a year earlier and profit margins are expected to improve.
   Finkelstein doesn't delude himself about how tough his job will
be in a prolonged economic slump.
   ``We may have to be running this business with tight economies,
with tight expense control for as much as two years,'' he said.

   The retailer that evolved from a dry goods shop

   In addition to the Manhattan flagship, the chain famous for
Thanksgiving Day parades operates a branch at the Garden State

   R. H. Macy &amp; Co. employs 78,000 people at its 149 department

   It runs 97 stores under the Macy's name, 22 Bullock's stores, 30
I. Magnin stores, plus about 90 smaller specialty Aeropostale,

unsuccessful as a merchant in three earlier ventures, opened a
small dry goods store on Sixth Avenue in Manhatan. His first day's
sales were recorded as $11.06. His store sold ribbons, laces, fake
flowers, handkerchiefs, gloves and other miscellaneous items.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Ranks as Biggest U.S. Ad Spender in 1989, Magazine
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food and tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos. was
the heaviest U.S. advertiser in 1989 for the third consecutive
year, the trade publication Advertising Age reported Wednesday.
   Philip Morris, the New York-based manufacturer of Marlboro
cigarettes, Miller beer, Maxwell House coffee and Kraft foods,
spent $2.07 billion on advertising last year, up from $2.06 billion
in 1988, the magazine reported.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the Cincinnati-based consumer products
maker that was displaced in 1987 after a longstanding run atop the
ad spending list, came in second once again at $1.79 billion, Ad
Age said.
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the retailer based in Chicago, moved up
one spot on the list to third place at $1.43 billion while the auto
giant General Motors Corp. of Detroit slipped one spot to fourth
place at $1.35 billion.
   Fifth was Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British owner of Pillsbury
Co. and Burger King Corp., at $823.3 million.
   Rounding out the Ad Age list of the top 10 U.S. advertisers and
their spending totals were: Pepsico Inc., $786.1 million;
McDonald's Corp., $774.4 million; Eastman Kodak Co., $718.8
million; RJR Nabisco, $703.5 million, and Kellogg Co., $611.6
million.
   Overall, the top 100 U.S. advertisers spent $33.9 billion in
1989, up 6.4 percent from $32.2 billion in 1988, Ad Age said.

   Wheat closed higher, corn was mixed and soybeans
were lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors and
rising fears of war in the Middle East.
   Wheat futures rose amid unconfirmed rumors that an Iraqi jet had
been shot down in the Persian Gulf and rumors that the government
might be interested in offering subsidized flour to the Soviet
Union.
   Choppy trading throughout the day reflected a growing
nervousness that the Middle East crisis could not be solved
diplomatically, said John Frazier, director of the agricultural
division for Gerald Inc.
   ``I think everybody's very nervous,'' Frazier said. ``They're
afraid something's going to happen and it'll run the markets up.'' mixed

dealer prompted speculation of impending export sales of the grain.

busn Northern California,
she said, she was primarily interested in nutrition. ``But you
quickly find out that what you're really doing is supporting the
small farmer, and in the long run helping maintain a regional food
belt.''
   In a study, Robert Sommer, director of the Center for Consumer
Research at the University of California-Davis, found that people
shop at farmers' markets for high-quality food, lower prices and
atmosphere, in that order.
   ``In the old days people went to the dump; now they go to the
farmers market. It's become a big social event,'' said August
Schumacher, outgoing commissioner of Food and Agriculture in
Massachusetts.
   ``Market shopping is really a form of entertainment. ... You
don't go to an open-air farmers market because it's convenient,''
said Hilary Baum of Public Markets Collaborative.
   All year, every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, dozens of
growers do business in Manhattan at Union Square Park - once a
haven for drug dealers - and provide more than ample atmosphere
amid fragrant waist-high stalks of basil, chef demonstrations,
tours and tastings.
   One recent day shoppers could choose white eggplant, cider,
peaches, apples, okra, sour cherries, squash blossoms, raspberries,
eggs, chickens, bursting sunflowers, and apple and blueberry pies.
   A woman at a fish stand hands out cards with a number to call a
day ahead to find out what kinds of fish will be spread out on ice
the next morning. The Blews, who farm in Pittstown, N.J., offered
13 kinds of peppers.
   New York City's markets range from the sprawling Union Square
market - where, Benepe said, growers can make up to $10,000 a day -
to one on the Lower East Side, six farmers once a week. Farmers pay
less than 5 percent of gross for their stalls, he said.
   Growers first came to Greenmarket ``with great skepticism,''
Benepe said. ``They feared they'd come with full loads and go home
with empty pockets. Rip-off city.''
   They found otherwise.
   Merrie Kernan gets up at 2:30 a.m. three days a week to drive a
truckload of produce 125 miles from Bridgton, N.J. She likes
talking with New Yorkers, even those who ask when banana season
starts, or will she have oranges or artichokes soon.
   Then there are the kids she brings lightning bugs for. And the
customer who just bought a small farm and told Kernan she was going
to pay someone to cut the hay. ``I told her - you don't pay
somebody. They pay you.''
   ``Running a farm is very grueling and very demanding. There are
times you feel discouraged,'' Ryan said. ``And the thing that
really makes it worth it, honestly, it's such a shot in the arm to
get in that truck and go to market on Saturday and know that it's
all worthwhile.''
   And for consumers, studies show prices are 5 percent to 30
percent lower at farmers markets, where there are no ``middlemen''
and low transportation costs. There is more than good shopping at
work, however.
   Without the markets, many family farms - too small to comply
with demands for volume and uniformity of whole distributors -
would be forced to sell out. A Greenmarket survey found that 70
percent of its farmers said the market was either essential or
important to their economic well-being, Benepe said.
   In Connecticut, the non-profit Hartford Food System found that
farmers could not afford to run full-scale markets in the poorest
neighborhoods. So it linked up with neighborhood organizations,
bought food from farmers and opened farmstands, said Mark Winne,
the organization's executive director.
   Connecticut also is one of 10 states in the federal Farmers
Market Coupon program. Last year an estimated 275,000 poor women
and children were issued coupons worth $2.5 million. Many farmers
also accept food stamps.
   In Massachusetts, government made a difference, Schumacher said.
``The mayors of many cities wanted to link consumers to local
growers. They gave us wonderful spots, many in front of city halls
- Boston, Brockton, Springfield.''
   The markets, in turn, can help a city.
   A twice-weekly market saved downtown Pasco, Wash., said Linda
Sue Williams of the Pasco Downtown Development Association. Seventy
farmers drive to a lot where the city has in the last five years
built 48 shelters for growers and their food. Three thousand to
5,000 people shop there a week, she said.
   ``It's been credited by many many people with saving the
downtown,'' Williams said. ``It's the best thing that's happened to
Pasco in a long, long time.''
   But a Saturday market in Columbus, Ohio, across from a
convention center under construction, may be threatened by related
commercial development.
   ``There is support, but our future is still a little unknown,''
said Nancy Duncan Porter, executive director of the North Market
Development Authority, which formed to save the market from
becoming a parking lot just three years ago.
   ``Some people just like to tear down and build more than they
like to preserve,'' she said. ``The market is a very `people'
activity and social in nature, and we think a great drawing card
for downtown.''

Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State casino regulators on Wednesday
refused to let bondholders in the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort
participate in a hearing to determine the developer's financial
stability.
   The Casino Control Commission voted 3-2 against allowing
bondholders from arguing orally at the Oct. 30 hearing. However,
commissioners said the bondholders could petition to participate
later when the agenda for the hearing becomes more certain.
   The hearing will examine the financial stability of Trump's
three casinos and his ability to make a $47.3 million payment due
Nov. 15 to Taj Mahal bondholders. Negotiations on the payments are
continuing, so the scope of the hearing could change.
   The bondholders control $244 million, or 36.3 percent of the
$675 million in notes used to finance the casino.
   The commission ordered the hearing in August when it approved a
$65 million bank bailout to help Trump make an overdue June 15 bond
payment on the Trump Castle Casino Resort By The Bay.
   A state Division of Gaming Enforcement report cast doubt on
Trump's ability to make the Taj Mahal payment in November and on
his overall finances, which are weighed down with $3.2 billion in
debt.
   Martin Greenberg, the attorney for the petitioning bondholders,
told the commission the bondholders should be allowed to argue
orally and in writing during the hearing.
   ``It is safe to say there is concern with the apparent inability
to make that payment,'' Greenberg told the commission. ``We do not
seek to delay. We do not seek to make more difficult your function.
... We do not seek to use this forum as a means of negotiating with
the Taj Mahal.''
   But acting commission Chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said the
request was premature because the scope of the hearing has yet to
be determined.
   She also said she wanted to avoid setting a precedent that would
allow groups to use the commission as a forum, although she
stressed the bondholders are not in that category.
   Letting anybody participate in hearings would be tantamount to
``birds flocking to an open landfill,'' Ms. Armstrong said.

   Venezuela projected its oil sales at
$19 per barrel for 1991, and expects to export an average of 1.9
million barrels per day, newspaper reports said Wednesday.
   Quoting Marcos Morales, the planning ministry's director of
short-term planning, the daily Economia Hoy said average crude
sales for 1990 were now projected at 1.85 million barrels per day,
up from the originally forcast 1.75 barrels.
   Venezuela also hiked its expectations for 1990 economic growth,
from 2 percent to 2.5 percent, the report said.
   Venezuela's GNP shrank by more than 8 percent in 1989 following
the government's start of a drastic economic austerity program.

   The stock market declined today, nearly erasing
the gains of the previous session as anxiety over the Middle East
prevailed.
   Prices opened mixed before the drift lower gathered momentum.
Analysts said the market appeared to stabilize only because sellers
moved to the sidelines, not because buyers had surfaced to put a
floor under prices.
   Stocks managed to inch up from their worst levels only in the
last hour of trading.
   In the energy pits, the near-term crude contract climbed back
above $38 per barrel. But Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Gruntal Financial Inc., cautioned that what's burdening the stock
market is more complex than just rising oil prices. ``We've had
some relief in the upward pressure on energy prices, but we've had
no relief in the . . . war talk.''
   Indeed, many analysts said the possibility of a military
conflict with Iraq has paralyzed the market, inhibiting traders
from holding stocks even overnight for fear war might break out and
they would be left vulnerable.
   Further, concerned about the economy and the budget deficit add
an element of confusion to the market. The lack of agreement on a
budget-reduction plan, coupled with today's announcement that
durable goods orders fell 0.8 percent in August, ``brings
everything back into light that things are not that good,'' said
James Schroeder, an analyst at MMS International in Chicago.

<HEAD>Italian Authorities Seize Facilities Of Cetus Supplier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMERYVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cetus Corp. said it will seek other
sources of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin after Italian
authorities seized the production facilities and inventory of a
supplier.
   But the biotechnology company, already smarting from federal
refusal to approve one of its own cancer-fighting drugs, said
Tuesday's seizure of SICOR could be harmful.
   ``Unless SICOR is able to overturn this decision ... it could
have a significant effect on our generics business,'' said Cetus
spokeswoman Katharine Russell.
   Doxorubicin is considered the most important product that Cetus
has sold through a joint venture with Ben Venue Laboratories of
Bedford, Ohio. The venture generated $33 million in sales for the
fiscal year that ended June 30.
   The seizure followed an investigation by the public prosecutor
in Milan into allegations of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets
by SICOR.
   SICOR also has been accused of stealing the strain that produces
doxorubicin from Farmitalia Carlo Erba, S.R.L., an affiliate of
Erbamont NV of Stamford, Conn. Erbamont sells doxorubicin in the
United States under the trademark Adriamycin.
   The Cetus-Ben Venue joint venture began selling doxorubicin last
year after the original patent for Adriamcin expired. Farmitalia
had developed the drug in the early 1970s.
   In July, the Food and Drug Administration refused to approve
Interleukin-2, Cetus' anti-cancer drug. The company also has been
troubled by layoffs and a loss of $61.5 million for the past fiscal
year.

<SECOND>Federal Budget Impasse Has Meat Packers Fretting</SECOND>
<DATELINE>GARDEN CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monfort Inc., one of the nation's
largest meat packers, has stopped buying cattle for slaughter
because of a possible furlough of federal meat inspectors.
   Other southwest Kansas packers say they are concerned that
failure by Congress to approve a budget by Sunday - the deadline
under the severe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction measure -
might force furloughs of federal government employees, including
meat inspectors.
   The Food Safety and Inspection Service and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture would have to lay off 7,500 meat inspectors from
Oct. 9 through 13. In effect, that would shut down all meat and
poultry slaughter and processing plants regulated by the agencies,
said Jim Greene, a spokesman for the inspection service in
Washington.
   ``Obviously, if you don't have federal inspectors, you can't
operate your plant,'' said Gene Meakins, vice president of public
relations for Monfort.
   That could cause ripples throughout the industry, such as a
backlog of cattle at feed yards and higher consumer prices, company
officials say.
   Harry Siegelman, group vice president of cattle procurement for
Monfort, said Wednesday the company won't buy cattle for the week
of Oct. 8.
   ``We are planning on not killing that week, the way it stands
right now with inspection,'' he said.
   Monfort, based in Greeley, Colo., has a Garden City plant that
employs 1,270 people.
   Dave Bartel, a spokesman for Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said
earlier this week that if a budget agreement isn't reached,
Kassebaum has promised a continuing resolution to keep the present
arrangement with meat inspectors until there is an agreement.
   Officials at IBP, which owns a 2,700-employee plant near Garden
City, said they were working through the American Meat Institute in
Arlington, Va., to ensure a furlough doesn't happen.
   ``We're not aware of any slowdowns at this point,'' said Gary
Mickelson, manager of communications.
   He said it wasn't the first time the industry has faced the
possibility of a budget-related furlough of inspectors, but they
were always averted before.
   ``We're hopeful this will be the case this time,'' Mickelson
said.
   Rich Parker, director of information for the American Meat
Institute in Arlington, Va., said members of Congress have been
told that furloughs could hurt the industry.
   ``There's a possibility you could see a shutdown but we don't
think it will happen,'' he said.
   Five giant packing plants in southwest Kansas, including Monfort
and IBP, employ more than 8,200 people. The state ranked first in
the nation in 1989 for the number of cattle slaughtered, at 6.2
million head killed.

<HEAD>Commodity Fraud Lawyer Seeks Merc Leader's Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal subpoena seeking the trading records of
Chicago Mercantile Exchange leader Leo Melamed and other officials
is ``a publicity stunt,'' the exchange said Wednesday.
   The records were requested by Thomas A. Durkin, a defense lawyer
in a commodities fraud trial who contends that everyone at the Merc
``from the top on down'' routinely ignored trading rules.
   Melamed is chairman of the exchange's executive committee and
its best-known official. He has not been charged in the case.
   Durkin sent a subpoena last week to Melamed's trading firm,
Dellsher Investment Co. He sent another to the Merc seeking more
general trading records of exchange officials, including the board
of governors.
   ``The defense attorney's subpoenas served on officers of the
exchange can be characterized in the nature of a publicity stunt,''
Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma said.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office has repeatedly stated that neither
the exchange nor its officers nor its member firms are in any way
targets of the investigation.''
   Yemma said Melamed was unavailable for comment.
   Durkin is defending Sam Cali, one of 14 Japanese yen futures
traders currently standing trial on federal charges including mail
fraud and racketeering.
   The charges stem from a federal probe of corruption at the Merc
and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two largest commodities
exchanges.
   Cali and the other defendants are accused of systematically
cheating customers, partly to avoid responsibility for mismatched
buy and sell orders known as out-trades.
   The subpoena served on Dellsher requests documents relating to
``all out-trades, price adjustments, errors or customer
complaints'' on yen futures contracts traded directly or indirectly
by Melamed.
   It also asks for copies of any checks, journals or ledgers
``reflecting the receipt of checks from floor brokers'' to settle
trading discrencies.
   Durkin said in his opening statement that all traders routinely
violated exchange rules to settle out-trades, but that such
violations did not constitute fraud or racketeering.
   He said exchange officials were aware of such violations,
although the exchange has denied it.

<HEAD>Two Michigan Newspapers Bans Tobacco Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of two Michigan
newspapers has joined the ranks of those banning national tobacco
advertisements, a move a tobacco industry official predicted ``may
come back to haunt them.''
   Greenville News Inc., which owns The Daily News and The Carson
City Gazette, a weekly, as well as shopping guides, announced its
decision in an editorial last week in The Daily News.
   ``Turning away easy dollars provided by agency-generated tobacco
advertising will be tough,'' wrote John Stafford, publisher of the
six-day-a-week, 8,500-circulation newspaper. ``But it's necessary
and responsible.''
   Thirteen other newspapers nationwide do not accept tobacco
advertising, but these are the first in Michigan, according to the
Newspaper Advertising Bureau.
   A spokesman for The Tobacco Institute, which is funded by the
tobacco industry, said the publisher had made itself vulnerable to
special interest groups offended by particular ads.
   ``It is hard for a newspaper to talk about free speech and to
rattle off bad restrictions for a common consumer product,'' said
Thomas Lauria, assistant to the president of the Washington,
D.C.-based group.
   ``They are starting down a road that can lead to serious
financial consequences and their self-imposed censorship of giving
information to smokers may come back to haunt them,'' he added.
   Larry Carbonelli, the newspaper's general manager, said the
decision was made after an anti-drug coloring book was inserted in
the Sept. 13 edition.
   ``It finally settled with us that it's kind of hypocritical on
our part telling kids not to use drugs and at the same time
carrying tobacco ads,'' he said.
   He said the ban is aimed at ads placed by industry agencies and
would not affect coupons advertising discounts on cigarettes by
local stores.
   Tobacco ads account for about half of newspapers' national
advertising, or roughly 3 percent of total advertising revenues,
according to advertising director John Dallos. He said the paper
would find some way to make up the lost revenue without increasing
its rates.

   A California real estate marketing company has
been retained to sell the bankrupt Aladdin Hotel and Casino after
months of behind-the-scenes efforts failed to find a buyer.
   Representatives of Santa Monica-based Kennedy-Wilson Inc. said
they would advertise the property in the United States and abroad,
and would accept sealed bids until Nov. 15.
   Officials hope the responses will produce someone who can
qualify financially and be able to obtain a gaming license. The
responses will be evaluated by the bankruptcy trustee in hopes of
locating a buyer, although bids could be rejected, officials said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Linda Riegle will have the final say on
who buys the Strip property.
   The troubled resort has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since last October. It was placed in bankruptcy by the
late Ginji Yasuda, who bought the property out of bankruptcy in
1986 for $54 million, then spent another $35 million refurbishing
it. Yasuda died of cancer in December.
   An attorney representing the bankruptcy trustee said efforts had
been made to assist parties showing an interest in the hotel, but
it was finally decided to hire a professional firm to market the
resort.

   The dollar ended mixed against major currencies
in a thin and choppy U.S. session Wednesday during which traders
refrained from staking out new positions ahead of the month's end.
   The approaching close to the first half of Japan's fiscal year,
coinciding with the end of the calendar year quarter on Sept. 30,
kept Japanese and U.S. banks from participating heavily in foreign
exchange markets.
   Dealers said institutional currency investors were busy catching
up on seasonal paperwork.
   ``It was a rather lackluster day in terms of liquidity,'' said
Scott Horwitz, a trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
   The dollar closed in New York near its lowest levels of the
session against the German mark, at 1.5660, down from 1.5735 late
Tuesday. Renewed speculation about a possible interest rate hike in
Germany after the east and west unite on Oct. 3 boosted the mark.
   High oil prices continued to weigh down the Japanese yen.
Worries about how Japan's oil-dependent economy will cope with the
price spiral caused a major selloff on the Tokyo stock exchange
overnight and eroded confidence in the yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 137.40 Japanese yen from
136.70 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 137.20
yen. The dollar traded at 136.855 late in New York, higher than
late Tuesday's 136.70 yen.
   Fresh U.S. economic news went virtually ignored. The two
Commerce Department reports confirmed the economy lacks vigor.
   The report on durable goods showed orders to U.S. factories for
long-lasting, generally expensive items dropped 0.8 percent in
August.
   Separately, the department reported U.S. personal incomes rose
0.3 percent in August, the slowest pace in four months, while
consumer spending rose 0.5 percent, the lowest in three months.
   European currency dealers, meanwhile, said the dollar gained
there on news that the U.N. Security Council had adopted a
resolution to tighten its economic embargo against Iraq by halting
air traffic into that country.
   An international force has been massing in the Persian Gulf area
since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, and the U.N. Security Council
has adopted a series of resolutions imposing economic sanctions on
Iraq.
   The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment haven in times
of international tension.
   The British pound fell to $1.8635 in London from $1.8765 there
late Tuesday. A pound fetched $1.8718 late in New York, compared to
$1.8785 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Tuesday, included: 1.3025 Swiss francs, down from 1.3080; 5.2410
French francs, down from 5.2665; 1.15635 Canadian dollars, up from
1.15055; and 1,172.00 Italian lire, down from 1,177.00.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's levels, were: 1.5715 German marks, up from 1.5630; 1.3110
Swiss francs, up from 1.2990; 5.2615 French francs, up from 5.2340;
1.7725 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7618; 1,176.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,168.25; and 1.1535 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1493.
   Bullion dealers said continued uncertainty in the Mideast meant
gold would continue its general upward trend, despite declines on
some markets Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled at $406.60 a
troy ounce for the September contract, up $4.20 from Tuesday.
Later, Republic National Bank quoted an ounce of gold bullion at
$406.70, $5.45 higher than Tuesday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $404.85 a troy ounce from
$403.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $402.50 from $404.25 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.28 to close at a bid of
$400.17.
   Silver prices moved lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $4.798 a troy ounce from Tuesday's
settlement of $4.834. In London, silver dropped to a late bid of
$4.81 a troy ounce from $4.87 Tuesday.

   Norden Systems Inc. announced plans
Wednesday to close one of its two New York plants and consolidate
its radar manufacturing at its Norwalk facility.
   The defense contractor said the move would result in an
undetermined number of layoffs.
   Norden's Farmingdale, N.Y., plant will close, while radar
operations at its other Long Island plant in Melville will be
shifted to Norwalk, the company said. The manufacturing of
non-radar systems will be consolidated at Melville.
   ``Long Island operations will be consolidated into a single
facility in Melville,'' Daniel R. Nuzzo, Norden's president, wrote
Tuesday in a letter to employees.
   Norden, a subsidiary of Hartford-based United Technologies
Corp., has already laid off 275 employees this year and cut 62 jobs
through attrition and retirement.
   The company's two New York plants employ about 770 people.
   Norden was dropped last year as a subcontractor to develop the
radar system for the U.S. Navy's A-12 fighter jet, resulting in 600
layoffs.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices declined in light dealings
Wednesday as investors gave up hope that the market could stage
back-to-back rallies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 32 points
on Tuesday, fell 25.99 to close at 2,459.65.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of about 3 to 1
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,119 down, 421 up and 454 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.57 million
shares, against 155.94 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.44 million shares.
   Stock prices opened mixed but quickly turned lower. ``The market
is without perspective . . . there's no focal point,'' said Eugene
Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
   ``Earnings estimates are in flux, analysts are scrambling to
downwardly revise their outlooks, current dividends are in question
and there's not a lot of confidence they will be maintained,''
Peroni said of the factors that have eroded confidence in equities.
   Indeed, portfolio managers, who are ``frustrated and tired of
waiting for a technical rally that hasn't arrived,'' are selling
blue-chip stocks, which puts pressure on the rest of the market,
said Ralph Acampora, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Higher oil prices also worked to depress the stock market. The
near-term crude contract rose above $39 a barrel before backing off
at the close.
   Continued uncertainty in the Middle East is inhibiting traders
from taking even short-term positions for fear war could break out
overnight. One analyst called Iraq a ``wild card'' that is
preventing the market from responding to fundamental factors, like
interest rates and general economic data.
   One of the session's few bright spots was MCA, which is rumored
to be near a buyout agreement with Japan's Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. at a price that could go as high as $7.5 billion.
   A burst of trading in MCA helped lift the Dow from its worst
levels in the final hour of trading. MCA jumped 7\ to close at 61\
and was the second most active issue on the Big Board. Some
analysts are hoping MCA will rekindle interest in potential
takeover targets.
   Elsewhere, however, the banking sector was hard hit. Citicorp,
which confirmed it was laying off 100 employees in its leveraged
buyout department, fell 1 to 14{; Chase Manhattan was off ~ at 11&lsqb;;
Manufacturers Hanover was off 1&lsqb; at 21\, and Chemical Bank was down
} at 15.
   Among other actively traded issues on the Big Board, AT&amp;T fell &rsqb;
to 31{; IBM was down 1 at 105&rsqb;; General Electric slipped | to 55;
Waste Management fell 1&lsqb; to 32&rsqb;, and Eastman Kodak lost 1 to 39&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $28.95 billion, or 0.99
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.68 to 167.52.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.74 to 359.99, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 3.20 to 305.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
4.75 to 350.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 310.06, down 3.11.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The level of consumer confidence in the United
States was unchanged in August, but that left public sentiment on
the economy at its lowest point since the 1982 recession, the
Conference Board said Wednesday.
   The business research organization said its Consumer Confidence
Index remained at 84.7 in September. The index plunged 17 points to
that level in August following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Fabian Linden, a Conference Board economist, said consumers
remained uncertain as there was little progress in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``People are increasingly concerned that inflation and interest
rates will be rising,'' Linden added.
   Oil prices have surged since the Middle East tensions erupted.
This has heightened consumer concerns about inflation and the
economy, and many have curtailed their plans to buy houses or cars
in the last two months, the Conference Board said.
   A drop in consumer spending is itself a threat to the economy
because consumer pending accounts for about two-thirds of the
gross national product.
   The Conference Board is a business-funded organization. Its
monthly survey on consumer confidence is conducted by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, and questions 5,000 households
throughout the country.

<HEAD>Newsweek, Times Mirror Magazines Team Up to Offer Joint Ad Deals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsweek and Times Mirror Magazines are teaming
up to offer advertisers package deals involving combinations of
their magazines and affiliated newspapers, television stations and
cable TV systems.
   The sponsors said the program was a first for separately owned
consumer magazine publishers.
   Companies that publish several magazine titles, such as Time
Warner Inc. and Hearst Corp., have frequently sold packages
involving space in combinations of their own magazines, newspapers
or radio and TV stations.
   But Newsweek, which is owned by Washington Post Co., and the
Times Mirror Inc. subsidiary said their program is the first
marketing package involving consumer magazines to be offered by
companies independent of each other.
   It is being called the Newsweek-Time Mirror Ad-Vantage program.
   Media analysts and the program's supporters say it should help
Newsweek compete more effectively against the newsweeklies Time and
U.S. News &amp; World Report in the scramble for advertising revenue.
   Many advertising experts felt Newsweek was placed at a
disadvantage when Time Magazine Co. launched an incentive plan more
than a year ago involving its magazines, which includes Time,
People, Sports Illustrated, Life and Fortune.
   The Ad-Vantage plan gives discounts to advertisers who meet
certain minimum spending criteria in Newsweek and at least four of
the 10 Times Mirror titles and agree to boost their spending in
those magazines by 20 percent.
   The companies said the 11 magazines in the program have a
combined circulation of 12.5 million, led by 3.1 million for
Newsweek, and can reach some key audiences.
   For example, they said the magazines reach 28 million men, or 33
percent of the adult men in the United States.
   The Times Mirror titles in the program are Field &amp; Stream, Golf
Magazine, Home Mechanix, Outdoor Life, Popular Science, Salt Water
Sportsman, Ski Magazine, Skiing, The Sporting News and Yachting.
   In addition to the discount plan, the companies plan to publish
special supplements that will appear in combinations of the
magazines.
   A supplement called ``Travels,'' for instance, will be published
next spring in Golf, Ski, Yachting and the portion of Newsweek that
goes to business executives. Another supplement called ``Your
Home'' will be published in the fall of 1991 with the full run of
Newsweek, Home Mechanix and Popular Science.
   The program will also enable advertisers to buy multimedia
packages that could include combinations of magazines and
newspapers owned by the parents of the magazines, such as The
Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and
The Hartford (Conn.) Courant.
   The multimedia packages could also include commercial time on
the parent companies' eight TV stations and their cable TV systems.
   The companies will also offer to create programs for magazine
advertisers that can include event sponsorship, outdoor advertising
and store displays.
   Peter Eldredge, publisher of Newsweek, said Newsweek hopes to
attrac more advertising from companies that deal in sporting
goods, insurance and home improvement that are heavy spenders in
Times Mirror magazines.
   At the same time, he said Times Mirror may get more revenue from
advertising categories represented heavily in Newsweek such as
automotive, business equipment, airline and liquor.
   James Kopper, executive vice president at Times Mirror
Magazines, said his company teamed up with Newsweek because of the
quality of the magazine and the long corporate relationship between
their parent companies. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times,
for instance, have operated a news service since 1963.
   He said in a telephone interview that he expects ``a
considerable incremental benefit'' to result for both magazine
operations as a result of the program.
   ``The entire marketing community has been screaming for
multimedia buys. This is a strategic alliance that enables us to
accomplish what the marketplace has been asking for,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. on Wednesday downgraded
its credit rating of Chase Manhattan Corp., becoming the second
major credit-rating agency to take the step in as many days.
   Chase, the nation's second largest bank, said Friday it would
cut its dividend in half this quarter, reduce its payroll and
increase its reserves for potentially troubled loans. Chase said
the steps would result in a third-quarter loss.
   S&amp;P said its action was prompted by Chase's expectation of a
loss as well as the rating agency's belief that as the economy
slows, the quality of real estate and other loans will deteriorate
more quickly than originally anticipated.
   ``Operating earnings (at Chase) should continue to be restricted
by poor loan quality,'' S&amp;P said.
   S&amp;P said it lowered by one notch its ratings of long-term debt,
preferred stock and certificates of deposit issued by Chase and
some of its subsidiaries. It affirmed its ratings of Chase
commercial paper.
   The ratings agency said about $5.2 billion worth of debt and
preferred stock is affected.
   In a statement, Chase said it disagreed with S&amp;P's action,
``particularly in light of S&amp;P's own comments citing Chase's strong
base of retail banking profits, the enhanced profits expected from
our aggressive restructuring efforts, as well as our liquidity and
financial flexibility.''
   On Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service, the other major
credit-rating agency, lowered its evaluation of Chase debt by one
notch on its scale.

<HEAD>Gold Continues Rise Following Mideast Rumors, Inflation Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices overcame early choppy trading Wednesday and
settled sharply higher amid unconfirmed rumors of fighting in the
Middle East and worries that an already sluggish economy is giving
way to inflation.
   On other commodity markets, silver and platinum fell sharply;
energy futures were mostly higher; wheat was higher; meat futures
were lower; and corn was mixed.
   Gold settled $4.20 to $5.80 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at $406.60 a
troy ounce. The December contract jumped as high as $10.80 before
settling lower.
   Demand for gold was triggered by an uncomfirmed rumor around
midday that an Iraqi jet had been shot down in the Persian Gulf.
Higher crude oil prices and investor worries of inflation also
helped the market along, analysts said.
   ``With oil prices approaching $40 (a barrel) and inflation, that
changes the picture for gold,'' said Peter Cardillo, director of
commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal and Co. Inc. in New York.
``It puts gold at a higher level. We may see it trading at $435 to
$440 (an ounce) in the coming days.''
   On the New York Mercantile exchange, light sweet crude oil
settled 3 cents lower to $1.14 higher with November at $38.67 a
barrel; heating oil was .74 cent to 2.48 cents higher with October
at $1.0257 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.95 cents lower to 1.45
cents higher with October at $1.001 a gallon.
   Analysts said platinum and silver extended losses from Tuesday
on signs of weakening economic activity in the United States and a
further decline in the Tokyo stock market.
   Platinum futures settled $4.10 to $3.80 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with October at $448 a troy ounce.
   Silver fell 4.2 cents to 3.6 cents on the Commodity Exchange
with September at $4.798 a troy ounce.
   Agricultural commodities also were affected by the Middle East
rumors. Wheat rose, corn settled mixed and soybeans were lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Choppy trading throughout the day reflected a growing
nervousness that the Middle East crisis could not be solved
diplomatically, said John Frazier, director of the agricultural
division for Gerald Inc.
   ``I think everybody's very nervous,'' Frazier said. ``They're
afraid something's going to happen and it'll run the markets up.''
   Rumors that the government might be interested in offering
subsidized flour to the Soviet Union also contributed to wheat's
gain.
   Corn was mixed after large purchases of futures contracts by a
major grain dealer prompted speculation of impending export sales
of corn, Frazier said.
   Soybeans extended Tuesday's losses as traders expected a bumper
harvest and waited for the release of the Agriculture Department's
quarterly grain stocks report after Thursday's trading closes.
   Wheat settled were { cent to 1} cents higher with December at
$2.76{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.28\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower
with December at $1.14\ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 2 cents
lower with November at 6.15{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures fell for a third straight day amid speculation
that demand for beef will slow if the economy weakens further and
the possibility that U.S. packing plants will close in mid-October
if there is failure to reach a federal budget agreement by Monday.
   Hog futures also fell as profit-takers continued to cash in on
last week's gains.
   Live cattle were .45 cent to .08 cent lower with October at
78.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .62 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with September at 89.17 cents a pound; hogs were .73 cent to
.03 cent lower with October at 54.07 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent to .25 cent lower with February at 56.20
cents a pound.

   Debt-stricken developer Donald J. Trump and
bankers who loaned him $245 million to buy the Trump Shuttle met
again ednesday to discuss Trump's problems making payments.
   Trump has already missed a $1.1 million interest payment on the
shuttle. A top aide said last week following a meeting with
Citibank officials that Trump wants to delay further interest
payments.
   A Trump spokeswoman, Norma Foerderer, confirmed that a meeting
between bankers and members of the Trump Organization took place
Wednesday. She would not say who attended or what occurred.
   ``As I understand, it was a very good meeting and everyone
understands what Saddam Hussein has done to the airline industry,''
she said. Trump has said his shuttle, like other airlines, is being
hit hard by rising jet fuel prices due to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that bankers would
demand that Trump cut salaries and lay off workers in exchange for
his continued control of the shuttle. Officials at the shuttle's
headquarters did not return a message left by The Associated Press.
   A spokesman for Citibank, the lead lender, did not return a
phone call Wednesday afternoon.

<HEAD>Chrysler Stock Slumping As Analysts Ponder Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. stock fell Wednesday to a level
unseen for years, amid growing concern about losses the automaker
will report for the third quarter.
   ``It's getting back to a price that it hasn't been at since
1982,'' said auto analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. in New York.
   Chrysler stock closed at $10 a share Wednesday, down 12{ cents
from Tuesday. It dipped below $10 briefly before struggling back on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The last time Chrysler stock closed at $10 a share was Nov. 12,
1982. Its highest price, after 3-for-2 splits in 1986 and 1987, was
$45.25 in September 1987.
   Chrysler's stock has been moving steadily down throughout the
year, but Phillippi and other analysts said Wednesday the company
isn't facing nearly the same problems that it did in the late 1970s
and early 1980s when it brushed with bankruptcy.
   Chrysler's stock hit its low point at $3.125 per share on Dec.
23, 1981, as it battled back toward profitability.
   ``We would make a huge distinction between '79 and wherever this
bottoms out,'' said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
of New York. ``The balance sheet liquidity, the product position
and the competitiveness of the (auto) group is better overall.''
   The current decline apparently is being driven by increasing
estimates of Chrysler's third-quarter losses, which could exceed
$200 million, analysts said. Through the first half of the year,
Chrysler earned $251 million, down 64 percent from the same period
last year.
   ``The whole market is off and when the market gets sick, people
think Chrysler's sicker,'' said company spokesman Tom Houston. ``We
haven't made any bones about we're not going to make any money in
the third quarter.''
   The analysts said the decline has nothing to do with concern
directly related to current national contract negotiations with the
United Auto Workers union or rising oil and gasoline prices
stemming from the Mideast crisis.
   Chrysler has about $4 billion in cash and marketable securities
on hand, a good amount for the company, they said.
   Chrysler's car and truck sales have been on the skids. The
company reported Tuesday that sales of its North American-made cars
and trucks, which make up nearly all of Chrysler's sales, were down
15 percent from last year.
   ``I think what you're looking at is a temporary gap in product
that's affecting their selling raee,'' Laughlin said.
   Chrysler executives and analysts are awaiting the 1992
introduction of a new mid-size sedan code-named the ``LH.'' It will
be the first all-new high-volume car designed by Chrysler in years.
   ``We've got enough (money) to get us to the time that we are
going to have the `LH' on the street, at least then and beyond,''
Houston said.

   During the period form 1984 through 1986, Drexel was at the
center of Wall Street's takeover boom. Clients came to Drexel, for
the most part, because of Drexel's unmatched ability to raise
capital through the sale of high-yield securities.
   . . . there is substantial evidence that Milken caused Drexel to
buy and sell securities based upon material, non-public information
misappropriated from certain Drexel clients. In one of these
instances, Milken traded on insider information for his own
account.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON THE DEFENSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken's submission dramatically exposes the gulf between his
crimes and his conviction, on the one hand, and his continuing
agitprop on the other. Milken has been convicted of serious and
sweeping crimes. His good works, however commendable, should not
shield him from incarceration. He should be sentenced to a
substantial term of imprisonment.
   . . . Milken is selling an old and threadbare story. By focusing
the court's attention on the five specific crimes he had admitted -
and by wholly ignoring his conviction on a broad conspiracy charge
- Milken is attempting to minimize his criminal conduct. Were
Milken to address the true range of his crimes, however, even he
would have to acknowledge a different conclusion. Milken's crimes
were serious and extensive.

<HEAD>LIKE HELL'S ANGEL CASE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken has been convicted of enormously serious crimes:
conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States, securities
fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, tax fraud, and recordkeeping and
reporting violations.
   . . . Although he has limited his allocution to five separate
acts in furtherance of that conspiracy, this court can and should
sentence Milken for all of his crimes.
   . . . In United States v. Kittel . . . Kittel, a member of the
New York Chapter of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club, was charged
with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute large quantities of
methamphetamine and with 11 substantive counts relating to the
unlawful distribution of methamphetamine. He was convicted on his
plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge and to one of the
distribution charges. In . . . Kittel's sentencing, however, the
government alleged that Kittel had participated in the murder and
dismemberment of another Hells Angels club member and the unlawful
manufacture of an explosive device among other acts of violence.
Judge (Pierre) Leval sentenced Kittel to a 14-year term of
imprisonment stating that the sentence was based not only the
particular offenses to which Kittel had pleaded guilty but on the
government's evidence of Kittel's unadmitted crimes - persistent
drug dealing and acts of violence.

   Moreover, although the government is asking the court to
sentence Milken on crimes more numerous than he has specifically
admitted, these additional charges are similar to the crimes that
Milken has admitted: manipulating stocks, unlawfully influencing
corporate events through the concealed ownership of securities,
unlawfully providing benefits to clients and client representatives
in order to cultivate their business, and fraudulently
misappropriating funds from clients.
   . . . Indeed, Milken's agreement to pay $200 million in criminal
penalities and $400 million in restitution dramatically belies both
his contention that he committed only the five enumerated crimes
and his argument that even these crimes were aberrational and
technical violations. These fines, penalties, and restitution fix
the scope of Milken's criminal conduct. Milken's agreement to pay
these monies stands out as the most reliable measure of his
criminal conduct.
   For all these reasons, this case is sharply different from
United States v. Freeman . . . In Freeman (where the judge refused
to admit a sentencing report on additional crimes), the defendant
pleaded guilty to one narrow insider trading charge, not to
multiple offenses and a broad conspiracy charge. Unlike Milken,
Robert Freeman did not acknowledge the government's right to put
before the court his ``unadmitted'' offenses. Unlike Milken,
Freeman, in his allocution, did not admit that he committed crimes
additional to the crimes to which he specifically pleaded guilty.
Finally, Freeman did not agree to pay criminal fines and
restitution penalties of $600 million.

<HEAD>PUSH FOR PRISON TIME</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken should be sentenced to a substantial period of
incarceration commensurate with his crimes. Those crimes were
pervasive and systemic. They were committed for venal reasons - to
enhance Milken's personal power and increase his wealth. No good
works undertaken by Milken mitigate the imperative of a substantial
prison term. Milken's proposal that he be sentenced to a
probationary term and community service is absurd. Such a sentence
would eviscerate law enforcement's efforts to police and deter
financial crime.
   . . . Milken's crimes have had nationwide impact and his
sentence will become the touchstone for every sentence for
financial crime in the country.
   . . . other sentences demonstrate a consensus among judges that
absent significant actual cooperation, a major securities law
violator such as Milken will receive a substantial term of
incarceration.
   Boesky's three-year term of incarceration provides a useful
point of departure. As an initial, symbolic matter, Milken stands
convicted of six times as many felony charges as Boesky and has
agreed to pay six times Boesky's criminal fine and civil penalty.
While the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic should
determine Milken's sentence, Milken's suggestion that - facing
almost six times Boesky's penalty - he merits a fraction of his
punishment is preposterous.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILKEN'S COOPERATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like Boesky and Levine, Milken committed very serious crimes.
Unike Boesky and Levine, however, Milken has not cooperated. On the
urging of the government, Boesky and Levine each received reduced
sentences because of their extraordinary assistance in the
successful prosecutions of others.
   . . . Boesky's cooperation resulted, directly and indirectly, in
the successful prosecution of numerous prominent securities
industry professionals in addition to Milken. In sharp contrast,
during the four years of Boesky's cooperation, Milken has
vigorously contested the government's charges and allowed the
statute of limitations to preclude prosecution of others based on
any information he could provide.
   . . . (The) sentence of Paul Bilzerian (to four years in prison)
for repeated securities fraud crimes should also inform this
court's exercise of its sentencing discretion. Bilzerian's sentence
was based on multiple criminal acts over an extended period of
time. His violations were similar in type to Milken's admitted
crimes though fewer in number . . . Milken's conduct is, of course,
far more widespread and systemic than Bilzerian's.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RECOMMENDATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken stands before this court having been convicted of
six felonies carrying a maximum sentence of 28 years. He has
committed a range of serious white-collar crimes unmatched in the
1980s. The government respectfully submits that this court should
impose a sentence that reflects the full magnitude of Milken's
unlawful conduct and that unmistakably deters others . . . The
court's sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess great
wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or their
money will insulate them from certain and serious punishment.
   For these reasons, the government respectfully urges that . . .
Michael Milken be sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   Iran's top financial official on Wednesday
asked nations with huge oil stockpiles to help restore stability to
oil markets by tapping their strategic reserves.
   The White House announced later that President Bush would do
just that, offering 5 million barrels from the 590-million barrel
reserve stored in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
But Bush was not acting in response to the Iranian request.
   Industrial countries should ``use their current reserves to
relieve the current pressure on the international oil market and to
restore stability,'' said Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Iranian minister of
economic affairs and finance.
   The United States, Japan and European countries have reserves of
crude oil set up after the oil crisis of the 1970s to provide a
cushion against shortages.
   Some members of Congress have called for a release of some U.S.
reserves to help bring down the price of crude oil, which has been
moving up toward $40 a barrel.
   ``As far as we're concerned, a stable international oil market
will be beneficial for both the oil producers and the consumers,''
Nourbakhsh told the annual meeting of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
   He said the crisis is bringing many oil-producing countries,
including Iran, additional expenses for defense and for resettling
refugees from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Nourbakhsh said the cost of imports from industrial countries
has risen, ``resulting in erosion of any increase in the oil export
earnings of oil producers and fueling global inflation.''

   J2 Communications said Wednesday it had
changed its offer for National Lampoon Inc. to keep the deal's
value at $4.7 million in stock and warrants.
   The adjustment was made to reflect changes in the companies'
stock price since the deal was announced in March, said James P.
Jimirro, J2's chairman and chief executive.
   J2, a Los Angeles-based home video producer and distributor,
said it was mailing proxy material to shareholders of both
companies this week. The shareholders will vote on the offer at
special meetings scheduled for Oct. 24.
   Under a previous agreement, National Lampoon shareholders were
to receive two thirds of a share of J2 common stock for every share
of National Lampoon, plus a warrant to purchase an additional share
at $3.75. Under the new agreement, the warrant price will be $3.25.
   Jimirro, a former Walt Disney Co. executive, said J2 hopes to
breathe new life into the New York-based National Lampoon magazine,
which has lost money for a decade. J2 also hopes to cross-market
the National Lampoon name, made familiar through National Lampoon's
movie and TV operations in Los Angeles.
   ``Look at Disney,'' Jimirro said. ``What Disney does is fully
exploit franchises, and the Lampoon is a franchise in the same
sense Disney is, except on a smaller scale.''
   He said he hopes to create ``synergies'' through mutually
promoting projects in radio, television, film, merchandise, comedy
clubs and even satirical reviews on Broadway.

   President Bush's decision to tap into the
nation's strategic crude oil reserve will probably put the brakes
on the rapid rise in oil prices, at least in the short run, experts
said Wednesday night.
   ``We should be considerably lower,'' said Ed Kevelson, a Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. trader who deals in oil futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. ``You've certainly got that possibility
for a big move to the downside.''
   The president's announcement on Wednesday night was made after
the market closed to finish off a day in which wild rumors pushed
crude oil futures to a record-high settlement price of $38.67 per
barrel.
   Kevelson said that when the exchange opens on Thursday morning,
speculators will probably take a cue from the way overseas oil
markets respond.
   ``I'd be interested to see how London reacts off this,''
Kevelson said.
   The White House said the government would take 5 million barrels
of crude out of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which
contains nearly 600 million barrels of oil stored in salt caverns
in Texas and Louisiana. In announcing the decision, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said there has been no justification for the
recent run-up in oil and gasoline prices.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, crude oil prices have
almost doubled, from around $20 per barrel to nearly $40.
   Oil has shot up amid war jitters on the trading floor, even
though supplies have remained at adequate levels. The cash price
that is paid by oil companies is closely related to the futures
price that is paid by speculators who gamble on future supply and
demand but rarely take possession of any oil.
   Bush's move drew criticism from those who point out that the
strategic reserve was put in place following the oil shocks of the
early 1970s as a mechanism to fight oil shortages, but not high
prices.
   ``I think the administration may be trying to curb the
speculation of people in the Mercantile Exchange who keep bidding
up the price, which is having an effect on inflation,'' said
Professor James M. Patterson of the Indiana University School of
Business. ``This is really an economic move rather than an
energy-policy move.''
   Patterson said, ``I think this is strictly a political response.
I think it's inappropriate, but it may also serve as a test for the
workability of the reserve.''
   The reserve has never been used apart from a 1-million barrel
test sale in 1985 that was not aimed at influencing prices. Oil
from the reserve is auctioned by the Energy Department and picked
up by the bidders who are selected.
   A potential problem of the reserve is its quantities of ``sour''
crude, which contains high sulfur content that makes the oil
unusable in many U.S. refineries.

<TEXT>
   A law professor testified Wednesday that Neil Bush
adequately informed fellow Silverado savings and loan directors of
his dealings with a developer who got a $900,000 line of credit
from the thrift.
   A federal Office of Thrift Supervision official, however,
implied in testimony at an administrative hearing that President
Bush's son could have been more forthright with the Silverado board
about his relationship with Denver developer Kenneth Good.
   And another law professor said Bush's actions as a Silverado
board member were ``unsafe, unethical and unreasonable.''
   Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a Yale law professor summoned as an
expert witness by Bush's lawyer, said Bush, a Silverado director
from 1985 to 1988, gave the board enough information.
   He said Bush told the board he had business dealings with Good
before the board approved the line of credit for Good International
Inc., a partnership formed by Bush and Good. Bush abstained from
voting on the line of credit, which he and Good never used.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has alleged that Bush, as a
Silverado director, improperly voted on loans and credit for Good
and Bill Walters, another Denver developer who invested in Bush's
oil and gas exploration company.
   Good and Walters eventually defaulted on more than $132 million
in loans from the thrift. Silverado collapsed in late 1988 at a
cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The hearing, which could lead to Bush being banned from the
banking and savings industry, began Tuesday.
   Bush, 35, has not yet attended the hearing. He is scheduled to
be the last witness to testify, probably Thursday. His lawyer,
James Nesland, said Bush wouldn't invoke his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
   ``He will testify, and he will answer all the questions he is
asked,'' Nesland said.
   On Tuesday, former Silverado chairman Michael Wise, the
hearing's leadoff witness, invoked the Fifth Amendment 14 times
when questioned in the judge's chambers about his knowledge of
Bush's business dealings.
   Appearing with Bush will be another former Silverado director,
Denver car dealer Florian Barth, who refused to testify Tuesday,
but changed his mind, attorneys said Wednesday.
   Government counsel Stephen Hershkowitz told Administrative Law
Judge Daniel J. Davidson that Barth had decided to appear before
the hearing Thursday morning. Davidson had threatened to subpoena
Barth.
   Hazard testified he was unsure how much Bush actually told the
board about the relationship, but ``it was sufficient that he told
them he was in business with Mr. Good.''
   Hazard said he believed directors need to consider state laws
and legal opinions to gain insight into what their responsibilities
are.
   But Terry Sandefur, the OTS' assistant deputy district director
of supervision in Topeka, Kan., said Tuesday he was not as certain
as Hazard that the disclosure was adequate. He implied that Bush
may not have told the board all that he could have.
   Nesland pressed Sandefur on the issue. He said Silverado's
investment committee and the board itself - with Bush abstaining -
approved the line of credit unanimously.
   ``No doubt, at the board meeting, the transaction was found to
be in the best interests of Silverado,'' Bush's lawyer said.
   ``Maybe they perceived it to be in the best interests of
Silverado,'' Sandefur said, emphasizing ``perceived.''
   Edward G. Conry, a law professor at the University of Colorado
and a witness for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said Bush's
actions were ``unsafe, unethical and unreasonable.''
   ``His capacity to exercise impartial judgment was diminished
because of his relationship with Mr. Walters,'' Conry said. He said
Bush put his self-interest above Silverado's.
   Nesland, irritated, asked Conry: ``Are you a mind-reader?''
   ``I can see a vivid conflict of interest as well as anyone else
can,'' Conry said.
   On Tuesday, Russell Murray, a former Silverado executive vice
president, discussed his review of the $900,000 line of credit for
Good International. He testified he did not recall anyone
questioning it even though Good and Bush had a business
relationship.
   He said he discussed the request with Bush, Good and Silverado
chairman Michael Wise, and then wrote a memo to the thrift's
directors about the relationship before they approved the line of
credit.
   But he said that he did not have all the details of the
relationship and that he would have asked for a legal opinion if he
had had all the facts.
   After the hearing, Davidson and OTS officials will examine the
testimony and then recommend whether any action should be taken
against Bush.
   Last week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued Bush and
other former Silverado directors for $200 million. The lawsuit,
which also named Wise and Barth, alleged gross negligence on the
part of Silverado directors contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.

<HEAD>C-5B Safety Charges Surface in Lockheed Wrongful Dismissal Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. fired three auditors because
they blew the whistle on dangerously flawed metal used in the C-5B
cargo plane, their lawyer said Wednesday as trial of their wrongful
dismissal suit began.
   The lawsuit, being heard in state court here, contends they were
fired in 1985 for questioning the structural integrity of the
bodies of the C-5B, the biggest plane in the Western world.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages.
   Lockheed says the men were let go for unprofessional conduct and
violating company policies. But in his opening statement Wednesday,
attorney Herbert Hafif accused the big military contractor of
lying.
   The men were fired after they wrote letters to Lockheed's second
highest-ranking official demanding grounding of C-5Bs while
additional tests were conducted, Hafif told jurors.
   The first letter was ``the hottest potato ever handed down in
this industry,'' Hafif said. ``After a letter like that you've
kissed (a promotion) goodbye.''
   Hafif contends that even though no provable accidents have
occurred because of the deficiencies, the C-5B is very dangerous.
The plane, which can carry 145 tons of cargo, is being used heavily
in the Persian Gulf.
   Lockheed acknowledges that problems emerged in 1983, early on in
the C-5B program, with forged metal mainframe parts that were
heat-treated.
   The company maintains that it and the Air Force fixed the
problems and have studied the possibility of mainframe deficiencies
over the years. They have determined that parts were properly
prepared and are safe, Lockheed said in a statement.
   The auditors say they took their concerns all the way up the
chain of command to Lockheed's president at the time, Lawrence O.
Kitchen.
   Lockheed says one employee, Clyde Jones Jr., had already retired
before Kitchen learned of the matter. It maintains the others,
Thomas Benecke and Terrence Schielke, were dismissed for
circumventing company policies and audit procedures.
   ``Simply put, they totally failed to perform their jobs in a
professional manner,'' Lockheed said in a written statement of its
side of the case.
   In an August 1985 letter to Kitchen, the auditors said: ``Our
patience is exhausted.''
   ``We will not be delayed or stonewalled for any reason. This
issue deals with life and death, and this letter represents our
last resort in dealing with this problem internally.''
   Lockheed says the employees waited 22 months before suddenly
demanding that the C-5Bs be grounded. In a deposition, Kitchen said
he told the employees he didn't like their approach.
   ``I asked why they had not followed the procedure of an audit
report and taken it through the proper process; why they hadn't
carried out their responsibilities that they had as auditors; and
that I didn't appreciate them coming in at the last hour,'' he
said.
   Lockheed also said that it has proved sample materials taken by
the workers ``were not from production mainframe parts, and
additional tests of the materials themselves proved that they were
not defective as claimed.''

   A federal judge granted Greyhound Lines a
48-day extension to file its financial reorganization plan, the
Dallas-based bus company announced Wednesday.
   The ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard S. Schmidt extends
the deadline from Oct. 2 to Nov. 19.
   On June 4, Greyhound Lines filed for protection under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws. Under federal law, it has the exclusive
right to present a plan of financial reorganization for 120 days.
That period ends Oct. 2.
   ``We appreciate the court's vote of confidence in giving us this
brief extension,'' said J. Michael Doyle, senior vice president and
chief financial officer of Greyhound.
   In June, July and August the company's cash flow - earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation - was $3.72 million, $10.16
million and $11.80 million, respectively, the company reported.
   For the week ended Sept. 23, the company had ticket sales equal
to 94.2 percent of the comparable week last year.
   ``In many large, complicated cases such as ours, companies often
stay in Chapter 11 for two or three years, or even longer,'' said
George W. Hanthorn, senior vice president and general counsel of
Greyhound.
   The company has indicated it expects to complete its
reorganization plan before Thanksgiving.
   ``We have no plans to ask for additional time,'' Hanthorn said.
``Barring an unforeseen emergency, our plan will be submitted to
the court no later than November 19.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, arguing there is ``no
justification'' for speculation that has driven up the price of oil
and gasoline, said Wednesday he would sell 5 million barrels of
crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The White House said the Bush decision would send a ``signal''
to those who would take advantage of the Persian Gulf crisis to
profit from skyrocketing oil prices.
   Tapping the reserve, a move urged by industry analysts and some
members of Congress since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, was
aimed at driving down the price of crude on world markets.
   The president is turning to the 590-million barrel reserve to
stabilize the oil market for the first time since it was created in
1975. Oil was briefly pumped from the reserve in 1985 to test the
physical and bureaucratic systems for moving it.
   The price of crude oil has edged toward $40 a barrel this week,
nearly twice the level when Iraq's occupation of Kuwait touched off
the current oil crisis.
   Ed Kevelson, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. trader who deals in oil
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, said the sellng of
reserve oil could have a quick effect. ``We should be considerably
lower,'' he said. ``You've certainly got that possibility for a big
move to the downside.''
   Announcing his action at a Republican fundraiser, Bush said,
``It's especially important that America is economically healthy
and militarily strong.
   ``At home and abroad, let me caution those who might take
advantage of the current crisis in the Persian Gulf, those who
might seek profit by subverting the sanctions or, here at home,
those speculators who might try to drive up the price of oil.''
   The President said that even though ``the oil market is very
tight, with little spare capacity, there is sufficient oil to meet
current needs.''
   Bush said that oil markets had not taken into account additional
production from Saudi Arabia and other sources nor the availability
of existing stocks.
   Congress authorized the 5-million-barrel test sale two weeks
ago, over the administration's opposition, in a bill extending
Bush's authority to tap the reserve. That authority would have
expired Sept. 15 had he not signed the bill that day.
   ``We've been suggesting this to him,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who
called Bush's action a good first step.
   But Dingell said the administration needs to follow it up by
calling on West Germany and Japan - possibly at a meeting Friday of
the 21-nation International Energy Agency in Paris - to also tap
stockpiles.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, who more than a month ago
called on Bush to tap the reserve, also welcomed Bush's decision.
   ``The taxpayers have been paying for the oil reserve for years,
and they have every right to expect that it be put to good use in
the face of an energy crunch.''
   The 14-year buildup of the reserve has cost an estimated $20
billion.
   Industry experts have estimated that production in other
countries has restored about two-thirds of the 4.8 million daily
barrels of oil production removed from world markets by Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait and the world embargo against Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.
   ``There is no justification for the intensive and unwarranted
speculation in oil futures,'' Bush said.
   As recently as a week ago Bush, who spent nearly 20 years
exploring for and producing oil in Texas before entering politics,
voiced hesitation about resorting to the reserves, saying such an
action could stabilize the market but would not be justified in
terms of an oil shortage.
   ``This is a decision that the president came to reluctantly,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He said Bush reached
the decision only hours earlier in Chicago, after consulting with
Energy Secretary James Watkins.
   Another official said opinion in the administration had been
divided over whether to tap the reserve but in recent days ``people
were coming around'' to the view that it should be done.
   Fitzwater said there was no evidence that the oil industry was
involved in price gouging, but ``it's our judgment that price rises
of this nature could not be entirely based on legitimate market
forces.''.
   Fitzwater said the decision to put 5 million barrels on the
market was a test and the president would take ``additional steps
to stabilize energy prices'' if he believed they were needed.
   The oil is stored in a system of salt-dome caverns in Louisiana
and Texas and represents a 73-day supply of imports.
   The United States uses more than 17 million barrels a day.
   It should take about 15 or 16 days for the Energy Department to
award contracts after asking for bids and 30 to 60 days to deliver
the oil, the White House said.
   The reserves are accessible through the vast oil pipeline
network in Texas and Louisiana.
   Professor James M. Patterson of the Indiana University School of
Business said: ``This is really an economic move rather than an
energy-policy move.
   ``I think this is strictly a political response. I think it's
inappropriate, but it may also serve as a test for the workability
of the reserve,'' he said.

   MCA Inc. stockholders filed a class-action
lawsuit Wednesday in an attempt to open the bidding on a possible
buyout of the entertainment conglomerate by Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
   The Superior Court lawsuit seeks a court order to prevent MCA
and its board of directors from limiting talks to the Japanese
firm, a leader in the production of stereos, televisions and tape
players.
   An attorney for the shareholders said his clients aren't sure if
any other firms are interested in MCA. But Allan Schulman said the
plaintiffs felt an open bidding process might attract a more
lucrative offer.
   The Wall Street Journal has reported that Matsushita is offering
$70 to $80 a share for MCA stock, or $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion
for the firm.
   Roger Armstrong, MCA's vice president for publicity, said he had
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment. Other MCA officials
could not be reached Wednesday night.
   If completed, the acquisition would combine Matsushita's
dominance in electronics hardware with MCA's broad strength in
movie, record and television production. Matsushita's product lines
include Technics, Panasonic and Quasar.
   MCA's holdings include Universal Studios, MCA Records, Universal
Television - the producer of the ``Murder, She Wrote,'' series - as
well as MCA-Universal Home Video, a theme park franchise, a cable
TV unit, a publishing group, a concert and sports merchandising
arm, movie theaters and a 49 percent share in movie theater chain
Cineplex Odeon.
   Schulman said more than 73 million shares of MCA stock have been
issued, and public stockholders number in the thousands, although
he could not provide an exact figure.
   Both Matsushita and MCA have remained tightlipped about the
talks. Matsushita has said only that MCA is one of several
companies with which it is talking. MCA confirmed in a prepared
statement that it is in discussions with a major international
company regarding a possible acquisition, but would say no more.
   Word of the talks Tuesday sent stock soaring $19.50 to $54.00
per share. On Wednesday, stock rose another $7.25 to $61.25.
   MCA's 1989 revenues were $3.4 billion, with income of $191
million. Matsushita reported 1989 sales of $44.4 billion.
