   Florida congressmen said after meeting with
President Bush Thursday that they were optimistic Bush would bar
new oil drilling off the South Florida coast.
   But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the president made no
commitments on the matter.
   ``His previous statements as well as statements he made today
were indicative of a disinclination to proceed with further
drilling,'' in the tract 116 off South Florida, Graham said after
the 13 congressmen met with Bush at the White House.
   The lawmakers unanimously recommended against new drilling,
Republican Sen. Connie Mack said.
   ``With respect to his attitude I don't think that anyone in this
meeting came away with a feeling of disappointment. There was a
feeling that the president is going to be ruling in a way that
we're gong to be very happy,'' he said.
   Democratic Rep. Dante Fascell was less willing to assume the
president would decide to block exploration and drilling, but said
he, too, was ``optimistic the president will make the right
decision.''
   Bush is to announce, perhaps as early as next week, what his
plans are for the oil lease area off southern Florida and two areas
off Northern and Southern California.
   He held up any oil-exploration activity in the three regions
last year and named a task force to study the prospects and impacts
of drilling.
   The task force submitted its report in January, but Bush, a
former Texas oil company executive, has yet to act. He met this
week with task force members to discuss options and also has
consulted with the California delegation.
   Bush indicated to the Florida lawmakers he felt there was not
enough oil in the Florida waters to warrant the risk to the
environment that oil exploration would cause, said Republican Rep.
Porter Goss.
   ``He did not seem to feel that we had a whole lot of oil out
there ... to really justify all this havoc,'' Goss said.
   But Joe Lastelic, spokesman for the American Petroleum
Institute, said the government's 1989 estimates were that the South
Florida basin could contain as much as 1.06 billion barrels of oil.
Unocal Corp. has said it could be more than 2.5 billion barrels.
   That compares with an estimated 10 billion barrels of
undiscovered oil off the coast of California, said Lastelic.
   There are 42 gallons in each barrel.
   Bush asked the congressmen what should be done about 73 existing
leases, where activity has been held up, Fascell said.
   The congressman said he told Bush the government should
reimburse the lease holders.

   The handful of nations possessing nuclear
weapons should halt all testing and deployments as a step toward
slowing the spread of nuclear weapons technology, a former chief
U.S. arms negotiator told Congress on Thursday.
   ``If the majority of nations are to be expected indefinitely to
forgo (nuclear) arms ... should not nations already deploying them
also accept some constraints, especially now that the Cold War is
over?'' Gerard C. Smith told a House subcommittee.

   A jury Thursday found a 19-year-old white man
guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of a black teen-ager
in Bensonhurst, the most serious racial incident to polarize the
city since the 1986 Howard Beach case.
   Joseph Fama of Brooklyn, accused of being the triggerman in the
killing of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, faces a maximum sentence of
25 years to life in prison.
   Jury forewoman Tonya Bailey delivered the verdict shortly after
7 p.m. The decision followed 10 tension-wrought days of
deliberations during which police lined the steps of Brooklyn state
Supreme Court to quell occasional scuffles.
   Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of whites last
Aug. 23 after they ventured into the mostly white Bensonhurst
section of Brooklyn to look at a used car.
   The verdict, the first conviction in the case, was greeted with
shouts of glee outside the courtroom by Hawkins' family and
supporters, and chants of ``Yusuf! Yusuf!''
   Mayor David N. Dinkins, in a statement, said the guilty verdict
allows ``us to turn our attention to the process of healing.''
   ``Yusuf Hawkins died of racism in the first degree. That is a
crime far more common than most of us are willing to admit,'' the
mayor said.
   Fama was found guilty on 13 of 15 counts, including
second-degree murder by depraved indifference to human life, riot,
unlawful imprisonment, menacing, discrimination, and criminal
possession of a weapon in the third degree.
   The defendant was acquitted of second-degree intentional murder
_ the equivalent in seriousness of the depraved indifference charge
_ as well as criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.
   The shooting of Hawkins shocked the city and is the most serious
racial incident since the December 1986 attack in which a gang of
whites in Howard Beach, Queens, chased a black man to his
hit-and-run death on a highway.
   In the days after Hawkins' death, racial tensions in the city
flared as chanting protesters marched through Bensonhurst, clashing
with white residents who screamed obscenities and racial slurs.
   Fama sat impassively beside his lawyer as the verdict was read.
Several jurors wiped tears from their eyes.
   Moses Stewart, the victim's father, let out a quick, ``Yeah,''
but then said nothing else as the other charges were read.
   Hawkins' family and friends, holding hands with their advisor,
the Rev. Al Sharpton, walked silently out of the courtroom, saying
nothing. Then they let out a shout.
   Quickly they were surrounded by about 150 supporters who shouted
``Yusuf! Yusuf!'' At one point, Stewart raised a clenched fist in
the air and smiled. When someone handed him a bullhorn, he joined
in the chant for his slain son.
   ``This is a victory for the people,'' said Dave Walker, an
investigator for a Brooklyn civil rights group. ``The tension's
high throughout the city, throughout the whole country. ... All
communities needed the verdict.''
   Meanwhile, Fama's family was in a third-floor corridor and not
speaking to reporters.
   In Bensonhurst, the mood was defensive.
   ``I feel bad for Joey,'' said John Deliso, 21. ``It wasn't a
fair trial. The judge and the media sort of practically forced the
jury to come up with a guilty verdict.''
   ``He was a good boy. I've known him 20 years,'' said his next
door neighbor, a woman who refused to be identified. ``They didn't
have enough evidence. Nobody saw him with a gun. Nobody picked him
out of a lineup.''
   Bailey, the jury forewoman, said she did not feel the evidence
supported the prosecution's claim that Fama was the shooter. ``I
personally had decided that he was the shooter but there was not
enough evidence according to the law for me to convict him of
that.''
   Bailey, a college professor at Brooklyn Technical College, said
the deliberations took so long because ``It was that we examined
every single aspect of the law. ... We had differences of opinion
in how we interpreted the law.''
   The case had worried city and community leaders who feared
increased racial strie because of the murder.
   ``We hope that this is the last time we ever have to try one of
these cases,'' said prosecutor James Kohler. ``But something tells
me that we'll be back here again trying another one of these cases,
until people learn how to get along with one another. And stop all
of this racial hatred.''
   A second jury considering charges against co-defendant Keith
Mondello ended its deliberations Thursday without reaching a
verdict.
   David DePetris, Fama's lawyer, blamed the verdict on Judge
Thaddeus Owens' instructions to the jury, which he called
``substantially one-sided.''
   He said the prosecution theory focused on Fama as the shooter,
and his defense focused on rebutting that charge, but the judge's
instructions enabled the jury to convict Fama for participating,
even if it found he did not fire the shot.
   ``I think the verdict pretty clearly demonstrates that this jury
was following the judge's instructions as best as they could,''
DePetris said. ``But I think it also points up that the basis for
their conviction was that Joe Fama was on 69th Street and nothing
more.''
   The Fama jury had begun deliberations at 5 p.m. last Monday.
Co-defendant Mondello was tried in the same courtroom.
   The victim was slain on a warm evening when he and three
friends, all black, went to the mostly white Bensonhurst
neighborhood of Brooklyn to look at a used car.
   Fama fled after the shooting but surrendered a few days later
and has been held without bail since. Six other young whites have
been charged in the attack and still face trial.
   A mile-long demonstration march through downtown Brooklyn a week
after the shooting ended in a violent confrontation as
bottle-throwing protesters clashed with riot-equipped police
officers on the approach to the Brooklyn Bridge.
   Prosecutors allege Mondello, also 19, assembled a gang of 30 or
more of his friends from the neighborhood in south Brooklyn because
he feared 25 black and Hispanic friends of a neighborhood girl,
Gina Feliciano, were coming to beat him up.
   When Hawkins and his pals appeared on the street at about 9:20
p.m., the whites apparently mistook them for outside troublemakers.
Several of the bat-wielding whites surrounded Hawkins and pinned
the teen in a doorway, prosecutors said.
   Fama then pulled a .32-caliber automatic pistol and squeezed off
four shots.
   Two of the bullets went through Hawkins' chest, ripping apart
his heart. Another bullet hit his hand. The teen-ager tried to
flee, but collapsed bleeding on the sidewalk and died.
   In his closing remarks to the jury, Assistant District Attorney
Edward Boyar stared Fama straight in the face and shouted, ``Mr.
Fama, you are responsible for the death of Yusuf Hawkins. You had
the gun. You pulled the trigger. You are responsible.''
   But defense lawyer David DePetris methodically went through what
he called uncertainties and contradictions in the prosecution's
case against his client.
   ``Yes, the death of Yusuf Hawkins was a tragedy,'' DePetris
said. ``Yes, whoever shot, and whoever the prosecution proves shot
Yusuf Hawkins should be punished.''
   He argued prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that Fama was the gunman.

   Jurors who convicted a young white man Thursday
in the Bensonhurst racial slaying said prosecutors failed to prove
their charge that the defendant was the one who shot a black
16-year-old.
   But jurors said they believed Joseph Fama's role as part of the
white mob that attacked Yusuf Hawkins was enough to convict him of
second-degree murder by depraved indifference to human life and of
12 of 14 other charges.
   ``I feel that he had the choice, if he knew what was going on,
to leave the area,'' said jury forewoman Tonya Bailey.
   ``To act with a mob is depraved indifference to me. I've seen
mobs, and it becomes one entity, as opposed to individuals.'' said
Bailey, a professor at Brooklyn Technical College.
   ``I was personally convinced that he was the shooter, but there
was not enough evidence for me to convict him of that,'' she added.
   Hawkins and three other friends were attacked Aug. 23 as they
walked through the mostly white section of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.
   Jurors convicted Fama, 19, after state Justice Thaddeus Owens
told them the defendant could be found guilty of second-degree
murder even if he only participated in the attack.
   ``He is just as liable if he contributed to the realization of
the plan _ if he helped or made it possible,'' Owens told jurors
late Wednesday.
   The last holdout on the jury, telephone company worker Steven
Berquist, told reporters he agreed to vote guilty on the murder
count Thursday morning as the panel began its 11th day of
deliberations.
   ``If I had any reasonable doubt, I wouldn't have convicted,'' he
said.
   Although the case was one of the most racially charged in New
York, race played no role in the difficult deliberations, said
Debbie Cose and Michele Gardner, two of the three black jurors on
the 12-member panel.
   ``We put that aside in the jury room,'' said Cose, a secretary
in an accounting firm.
   ``We were family for 11 days,'' said Gardner.
   As Bailey delivered her verdict just minutes after 7 p.m.,
several jurors wiped tears from their eyes.
   ``The sympathy that we feel for both families made it very
difficult,'' said Kelley Freer, a young bank employee, her eyes
still red from weeping.

<TEXT>
   Alberto Fujimori, the Roman Catholic son of
Buddhist immigrants, counts on Protestant evangelicals to help him
defeat novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, an agnostic, for the presidency
of Peru.
   Fujimori's parents immigrated to this predominantly Catholic
country from Japan in 1934. He finished a close second to Vargas
Llosa in a field of nine candidates April 8 and a runoff between
them is scheduled for June 3.
   Vargas Llosa, an advocate of free markets, was the favorite, but
Fujimori surged late in the first campaign despite a shortage of
advertising funds. Polls show the once-obscure agronomist leading
his famous opponent less than three weeks before the runoff.
   Evangelical Christians, responding to Fujimori's message of
work, thrift and honesty, carried his campaign to areas the
poll-takers never penetrated.
   They spread the word in revival meetings, knocked on doors in
Lima slums and the violent Peruvian countryside.
   Raul Gonzalez, a sociologist, attributed Fujimori's strong
support in regions where leftist guerrillas are dominant to the
grassroots work of evangelicals and the diminishing presence of the
Catholic Church.
   ``The evangelicals have been working door to door, almost person
to person,'' he said. ``That has been very important.''
   Evangelical denominations have grown rapidly in Peru.
Sociologists say they offer moral and social discipline in a nation
being driven to anarchy by economic crisis and the leftist
insurgency.
   About 1 million of Peru's 22 million people attend storefront
Protestant churches and the number has doubled in five years,
according to the churches. The largest denomination is the Assembly
of God, which has 1,152 churches in Peru.
   The evangelical movement also has grown elsewhere in Latin
America. Efrain Rios Montt, a retired army general and evangelist
who led a Guatemalan military government in the early 1980s, is a
leading candidate for president this year.
   Jaime Althaus, a Peruvian anthropologist and newspaper
columnist, said the evangelicals reflect the conservatism of Change
90, embodying the ``values of work, effort, savings that are at the
base of grassroots capitalism.''
   Fujimori recruited Carlos Garcia, a Baptist preacher, in
November as a candidate for one of the two vice presidencies.
Garcia later was elected president of the National Evangelical
Council, an organization of Protestant churches ranging from
Methodists to Pentacostals.
   Evangelicals made up about one-fourth of the 200 congressional
candidates for Change 90, Fujimori's party. Many young party
workers belong to the movement.
   Change 90 won about 50 of the 240 congressional seats April 8,
but the official results have not been announced. Fujimori got 30
percent of the vote for president, two points less than Vargas
Llosa.
   ``The evangelicals like Fujimori because he is honest and he is
the only truly independent candidate,'' said campaign worker
Ricardo Massa, a born-again Christian.
   Massa's uncle, Alejandro Rojas, is an evangelical minister and
general secretary of Change 90.
   Guillermo Yoshikawa, a Methodist minister and Change 90
congressional candidate, addressed a letter to the ``evangelical
public'' urging churchgoers to support the party's candidates.
   ``No longer will we have to ask `favors','' it said. ``Our
brothers in parliament will make sure that the rights granted us in
the constitution become a reality for all evangelicals.''
   Catholic church officials claim Change 90 supporters sent flyers
to convents, monasteries and groups of Catholic mothers urging
people to vote against Vargas Llosa because he is an agnostic.
   Cardinal Augusto Vargas Alzamora has said the church would not
endorse a presidential candidate, but the Apostolic League of St.
Pius X, a conservative Roman Catholic group, declared in its
monthly newsletter:
   ``If the evangelicals come to power, sooner or later Peru will
become Protestant. No more masses. No more processions. No more
saints.''
   Fujimori says attempts to portray Change 90 as a disguised
religious crusade are unfounded.
   ``I'm not preoccupied by religion and I don't discriminate on
grounds of religion,'' he said, but added, in an obvious reference
to his opponent: ``I believe Catholic people would prefer a
Catholic president.''

<TEXT>
   Americans in the Philippines, long
accustomed to deferential treatment in the country the United
States once ruled, still live the good life here, but safety is a
growing concern.
   Ordinary Americans often live in opulence undreamed of by poorer
Filipinos. Many have homes in in plush residential districts
guarded by private security firms, away from the noise, pollution
and rundown conditions of even middle-class Manila neighborhoods.
   But in the past two weeks, three U.S. enlisted men have been
slain by suspected Communist rebels, bringing to eight the number
of Americans slain in politically motivated attacks since April
1989.
   There is no widespread panic in the 140,000-member American
community, but there is a sense of unease.
   ``Everyone is aware of the threat,'' said Mark Blacker,
president of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines.
``We all live with a little bit of apprehension.''
   Concern is greatest among American diplomats and military
personnel, believed to be the rebels' primary targets. Senior
diplomats now drive in cars without diplomatic license plates and
vary their routes to work. Armed guards screen visitors at their
homes.
   ``We used to drive up to Clark (Air Base) every week to shop in
the commissary,'' said the wife of one American diplomat, who spoke
on condition her name not be published. ``But no more. People think
the area around the bases is just too risky.''
   It was near Clark that two young airmen were slain Sunday.
   The U.S. military's Far East Network airs frequent security
warnings, including advice against wearing uniforms off base.
   Children of officers assigned to the Joint U.S. Military
Assistance Group are forbidden from giving their home addresses and
telephone numbers, even to the staff of schools they attend.
   Security concerns of Americans were heightened by December's
bloody attempt to topple the government of President Corazon
Aquino. The coup bid was crushed with the help of U.S. jets.
   But fears were fueled by persistent rumors of a fresh coup
attempt and continued threats from Communist rebels.
   ``We will not stop until all U.S. bases and all American
occupational soldiers are kicked out of our country,'' said
Communist rebels who claimed responsibility for Sunday's killings.
   The slayings came on the eve of U.S.-Philippine talks on the
future of the six American military bases in the Philippines.
   Those talks have pumped up nationalist sentiment among the 60
million Filipinos, many of whom view the bases as a vestige of U.S.
colonial rule.
   Many Filipinos believe the United States, which ruled the
Philippines from 1898 until independence in 1946, still dominates
their nation economically, culturally and politically.
   Some examples of that can be seen in everyday life. Americans
are addressed as ``Sir'' or ``Ma'am'' while other foreigners
generally are not. Police often ignore Americans' minor traffic
violations.
   But such treatment does little to calm anxiety.
   After Sunday's killings, the off-base movements of 40,000
military personnel, civilian Defense Department employees and
dependents were restricted. Such warnings are becoming common.
   Several American families said they had curtailed the nightlife
of their teen-age children. They said they planned summer vacations
in the United States after foreign schools close in June.
   The American Womens' Club has noted a sharp decline in
attendance at social functions because British, Australian and New
Zealand nationals have been advised by their embassies to stay away
from places where Americans gather.
   ``We used to go somewhere every weekend,'' said the wife of one
American businessman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now, I
just travel between my home and the supermarket.''
   Last March, the commander of the rebel army, Romulo Kintanar,
said the guerrillas would not target American civilians who had no
links to the counterinsurgency.
   Officials acknowledge that if the rebels expanded their targets
to civilians, guaranteeing their safety would be impossible.
   Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, pointed to the huge number of potential American
targets.
   ``How can we protect them all?'' he said.

   Southfork Ranch was spared the recent
flooding in north Texas, but J.R. Ewing's home on ``Dallas'' hasn't
exactly been left high and dry.
   In fact, recent events sound more like a soap opera than many of
those shown this season on the TV series.
   The international symbol of Texas glitz and glamour as portrayed
on the series filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
temporarily blocking the 41-acre tourist operation from being sold
at auction.
   Employees also say:
   _ There have been two rounds of staff layoffs.
   _ Ranch house carpeting required replacement because pipes burst
during a winter freeze.
   _ Two Texas Longhorns broke down part of a fence trying to get
at a tourist who was irritating them by snapping photographs.
   _ And Buffie, the ranch buffalo, is pregnant.
   ``It's discouraging, but I think we'll remain open,'' said ranch
tour guide Paul Smith, 23, of Garland.
   It's no secret any longer that times are tough on the ranch,
filmed as the home of the fictional J.R., his mother Miss Ellie and
the rest of his extended family.
   The ranch, 25 miles north of downtown Dallas, is the state's
ninth most-visited tourist attraction. Its fortunes seem to have
fallen, just as in real life the Texas oil industry's aura of
invincibility evaporated. And its ties to the television series are
all but cut.
   Even the neighbors have noticed.
   ``J.R. Ewing would be welcome out here, if he needs to move,''
joked Nelda Burge, manager of the Southfork Mobile Home Park just
down the road. ``We have a J.R. Avenue and a Miss Ellie Lane.''
   Owner Terry V. Trippet did not return several phone calls made
over two weeks by The Associated Press.
   In August, Lorimar Distribution, producer of ``Dallas,'' filed a
lawsuit to cut off sales at the ranch of any souvenirs or other
items related to the series. Lorimar contends Trippet didn't renew
a licensing agreement and even wants him to remove the encircled SF
from the front gate.
   ``It is Lorimar Television's policy never to discuss pending
litigation,'' said Lorimar spokesman David Stapf in Culver City,
Calif., when asked the status of the lawsuit.
   Trippet, who like J.R. was once an oilman, bought the ranch in
1984 for $7 million in a heavily financed transaction. The ranch
generates income from groups who rent it for private parties.
   ``We've had a couple proms already this year,'' Smith said.
``There are dinners maybe four nights a week.''
   Although some first-time visitors are shocked at how small the
ranchhouse really is _ ``It's amazing what a wide-angle lens can
do,'' says Smith _ Southfork holds a special place in the hearts of
``Dallas'' fans worldwide.
   The show is broadcast in more than 100 countries and has been
translated into more than 30 languages.
   On a recent afternoon, a family from Malaysia, a foursome from
Great Britain and a Swedish man toured the ranch and snapped
pictures.
   ``I'm interested to see the entire world, but especially this,''
said Hans Helgemar, 40, of Uppsala, Sweden.
   His only disappointment was the absence of the man he knows as
``Yay-Are.''
   That is a constant disappointment for many other visitors.
   Stapf, the Lorimar spokesman, said the season that ended Friday
was the first in 13 years in which no episodes were filmed in the
Dallas area.
   Smith promised a group of tourists that the cast members would
be back this summer for more filming. But Stapf said he does not
know if that is so.
   Ms. Burge said many foreign tourists knock on her door, asking
for directions.
   But Ms. Burge has wearied of the series herself. ``To be honest,
I've quit watching it,'' she said.
   The series' contract with CBS has one more year. The network
hasn't said if it would renew the contract. Last week's episode
ranked 30th in the A.C. Nielsens Co. ratings.

<TEXT>
   With the death of puppeteer Jim Henson, creator
and alter ego of Kermit the Frog and scores of other Muppet
characters, it is like a room crowded with old friends has fallen
suddenly silent.
   Kermit cut a heroic figure for this age, a bemused voice of
reason in an absurd world. ``It's not easy being green,'' Kermit
sang on the preschoolers' ``Sesame Street,'' but concluded that
many nice things are green.
   Henson was tall, lean, bearded, with an unruly mane of graying
brown hair and a scholar's slouch. The loudest thing about him were
his sports coats.
   He always seemed a bit uncomfortable in front of the cameras.
Exposed to this world, he would patiently explain the logic of his,
where fluffy, furry, feathered critters had quirks and qualms like
our own.
   On ``Sesame Street,'' Kermit would interview three little pigs
about construction techniques; he'd cover the cow that jumped over
the moon as if it were a NASA space shot.
   As emcee of the syndicated ``Muppet Show,'' Kermit brought
dignity (and intense frustration) to the impossible task of
mounting a variety show with dozens of Muppets and one live human,
like Liza Minnelli or Paul Simon.
   There was no joke too ancient, no sight gag too skewed, no pun
too awful that Henson and his collaborators could not dust it off
and trot it out, usually with an elegant variation, for ``The
Muppet Show.''
   In one inspired bit, singer Della Reese sits in her dressing
room surrounded by clattering shellfish. Don't ask why. ``Oh, clam
up!'' she snaps. In another scene, Muppets horrifically collide on
a ski slope to the ambling strains of ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds.''
   Through it all, Kermit would cope, or try to, where others would
give up. And Henson, even while presiding over a multimillion
dollar Muppet empire, stayed with the frog.
   Like others of his generation, Henson's first exposure to
puppets was Burr Tillstrom's TV show ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie,''
featuring hand puppets Kukla the clown and Oliver J. Dragon with
their human friend Fran Allison.
   Henson saw that television and Muppets were made for each other.
The little screen might turn humans into one-dimensional talking
heads, but Muppets literally could fill the screen with action _
top, bottom and sides.
   Henson also took his puppets out of the traditional Punch and
Judy proscenium, using sophisticated materials and technology to
create them and put them through their paces. And what wonderful
characters:
   _ Big Bird, a whopping, yellow bird on ``Sesame Street'' with
the same cares and questions about the world as any 5-year-old. If
a bird that big can have questions about things, maybe it's OK for
a small person to wonder as well.
   _ Cookie Monster, blue and shaggy with quivering, crazy eyes,
could devour non-food substances with impunity, but would lapse
into hoarsely bellowing ``Cookie? Cookie? Cookie!'' at the prospect
of eating one.
   _ Miss Piggy, a prima donna whose blond tresses, blue eyes and
snout have graced pinup calendars, famed for her shrill battle cry
and karate blows and her not-so-secret passion for Kermit _ who, of
course, wanted nothing to do with her. Frog meets pig, frog loses
pig ...
   _ Fozzie Bear, a perennially flop-sweated comedian who can't get
a chuckle from a crowd with a tankful of laughing gas.
   _ Gonzo, a beakey creature whose passion is ... chickens.
   _ Rowlf, the gravel-voiced dog whose barrelhouse piano stylings
showed off a strong left paw.
   And so on.
   Henson went into a class by himself when he moved his creations
beyond television, putting the Muppets into three feature films,
beginning with ``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979.
   In 1982, Henson directed ``The Dark Crystal,'' a fantasy
adventure set in a never-world with no human characters. He
followed its success with ``Labyrinth,'' another fantasy feature,
in 1985.
   Henson's Creature Workshop also designed the figures of the
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' movie. Ultimately, Henson used
computers, hydraulics, radio controls and other electronic hardware
to make his puppets more lifelike.
   Henson lived his adult life doing exactly what he loved, and his
work showed it. As the theme song of ``The Muppet Movie'' concluded
about pursuing one's dreams, ``everyone needs a rainbow connection,
the lover, the dreamer and me.''

   Poor Emily. She was taken before her time. May her
sweet pig's soul rest in peace.
   The 680-pound swine was led down the garden path and out to
slaughter, the victim of man's brutish ways.
   ``They just sent her off to market without a fare-thee-well,''
said Karin Stoll, who raised the 4-week-old piglet to full-grown in
the Martha's Vineyard town of West Tisbury only to see her end up
in the hands of Jimmy Dean sausage makers.
   ``She had no business dying that way,'' the bereaved pet-owner
said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Stoll, a longtime resident of Martha's Vineyard, shared her sad
story with friends and neighbors on the summer resort island in an
obituary for Emily published in The Vineyard Gazette.
   Two weeks ago, about 15 mourners held a vegetarian ``pignic'' in
memory of Emily, who met her maker after a change of hands at the
farm where she was boarded until last month.
   ``Everywhere I go, people give condolences,'' Stoll said.
   Emily was a well-loved fixture known to many as Stoll's pride
and joy, but ``for 10 cents a pound the man who took her to auction
chose to overlook who she was.''
   She was a good pig, a gentle pig. Emily liked strawberries,
leftovers from Fat Tony's restaurant, rolling around on her tummy
and grunting along to favorite songs.
   But for all her talents, in the end Emily was just a pig like
any other in the eyes of her new caretaker. ``He telephoned out of
state to ask the old (farm) owner, who said, `The pig belongs to
the farm. Do what you want.' And he did,'' wrote Stoll.
   The farm manager hired a man to haul Emily to auction in
Seekonk, where she was eventually sold to Jimmy Dean, the sausage
company owned by the country and western singer.
   ``It stinks,'' said Stoll, who has taken some solace from her
two cats and two dogs. She never thought things would end this way
when Emily grew to 400 pounds _ too big for Stoll's back yard.
   Her first adoptive home was with Steve Morgan, who boarded Emily
with his pig, Helen. ``I arranged to pay for the corn and Steve
took on the ``slop'' detail,'' wrote Stoll. ``Emily became a social
sow as people went out of their way to visit `the girls' and of
course, to feed them.''
   But those golden days came all too quickly to an end. Steve
Morgan moved away and Stoll found the pig a new farm, the last home
she would know.
   ``Life seemed sweet for Em,'' Stoll remembered. ``Until ... I
found her gate open and her pen empty.''
   Stoll said she didn't believe the farm manager and others
implicated in Emily's death acted out of malice. It was something
worse, she said.
   ``After much investigation, the culprits seem to be apathy,
greed and ultimately, cruelty,'' wrote Stoll, who did not identify
the owners.
   ``How could such a thing happen, especially in this wonderful,
safe place we call Martha's Vineyard?''

   The police force is not called the
Sandinista Police anymore, but who really controls them is far from
certain _ something made glaringly clear Tuesday and Wednesday in
the strike of government workers.
   In other countries, strikers and police often fight with tear
gas, rocks, firebombs and nightsticks. But practically nowhere is
the police force still so closely identified with a political party
that became the opposition only three weeks ago.
   ``It's the same ... people,'' said Joaquin Morales, a
40-year-old construction worker at Managua City Hall. ``Different
name, but still the same.''
   Supporters of the new government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro see the police as a Sandinista force; Sandinistas can't
understand why the police obey a government they consider a class
enemy.
   At the height of a standoff between the government and striking
workers, Sandinista labor leader Lucio Jimenez said he didn't worry
about police force breaking up the walkouts.
   ``We are going to give a fraternal embrace to police,'' he told
reporters.
   Police are stationed in front of government buildings and
facilities taken over by pro-Sandinista workers.
   At the telephone company, striking workers took food and ice
water to police officers outside the main building.
   Officers took naps under trees, sitting next to strikers who
left the main building for a cooler spot.
   At the Foreign Ministry, the only site of violence, police made
what looked like a half-hearted attempt on Tuesday at pushing
through a human barricade blocking the main gate.
   When a mob rushed the foreign minister and a dozen diplomats
standing across the ministry parking lot, only three police
officers stood guard outside the gates of a restaurant. The
officials ducked inside in a hurry.
   People in the mob yelled at the officers: ``What are you doing
guarding them? You should be protecting us, you should be on our
side!''
   The Chamorro government wants to appear in control of the police.
   La Prensa, Mrs. Chamorro's family newspaper, on Tuesday night
published glowing accounts of the police action at the Foreign
Ministry, calling its behavior ``diplomatic'' and running a
headline saying: ``Police Obey Order from Minister Hurtado.''
   Carlos Hurtado took over from Commander of the Revolution Tomas
Borge, whose Interior Ministry was renamed Government Ministry when
Mrs. Chamorro assumed power. The ministry includes the police,
immigration and other public order departments.
   It was Borge's pride, a force commanded by Sandinista militants,
where paramilitary discipline was as important as party discipline.
   But the police situation remains such that when negotiations to
end the strike began Tuesday night between Mrs. Chamorro and
Sandinista labor leaders, Police Chief Rene Vivas, a committed
Sandinista, sat in as an ``impartial witness.''

   Latvians, who poured into the streets to
sing their traditional anthem when their leaders declared
independence, are doing more listening these days.
   Strollers in Riga, the capital, clutch small transistor radios
pressed closely to one ear. People at bus stops hold out radios so
others can hear.
   The attraction is not a sporting event or a concert of Latvia's
beloved folk songs.
   Latvians now have their ears pricked to the internal politics of
independence. They are riveted to the live debate in the republic's
parliament as it forms a new government.
   Wednesday's session was not highly dramatic. It included, for
instance, the confirmation hearing for the next state arbitrator.
   Latvians listened nevertheless.
   ``Everyone is interested of late, when such crucial questions
are being considered,'' said Indra Grube, a teacher who is also a
member of a private dance group.
   ``People are devoting some of their free time to politics,
especially nowadays,'' she said.
   Miss Grube, dressed in a traditional white folk-dancing costume
and gold headband, spoke in a small central park where Riga
Television was taping performers in preparation for the annual
summer song-and-dance festival.
   Next to the park, about three dozen people were mixing the twin
passions of song and politics, joining in an impromptu chorus of a
patriotic melody beneath a white stone obelisk topped by the statue
of Mother Latvia.
   Someone in the crowd waved a flag of the neighboring Baltic
republic of Lithuania as the group sang ``On the Shores of the
Daugava,'' a traditional song of Latvian unity.
   Latvia declared the beginning of a transition to independence on
May 4, and Lithuania proclaimed outright independence on March 11.
   Someone in the crowd Wednesday shouted, ``Why are you waving a
Lithuanian flag?''
   Another person replied, ``Because we need solidarity.''
   (Late Wednesday, Lithuania's Parliament offered to suspend laws
it enacted since declaring that republic's independence if Moscow
agrees to negotiate an end to their tense impasse.)
   The site, known as the Freedom Monument, often has been compared
to London's Speaker's Corner, where all manner of people voice
their opinions to anyone who'll listen.
   On Wednesday, Max Sikka, 60, proudly displayed his Estonian
passport that predated the Soviet annexation of the Baltic
republics in 1940.
   Others standing near the monument, which was decorated with
hundreds of lilacs, carnations, and tulips, spoke of a hopeful mood
in Latvia.
   ``We are not afraid of economic difficulties _ our shops are
empty anyway, because Moscow has spoiled our economy,'' said Raitis
Jansons, a member of the pro-independence People's Front.
   ``We are afraid of arms, tanks, and such military shows of force
as in Lithuania now,'' he said.
   Asked if Latvian independence would come at the cost of peace
with the Russians who live in the republic, Jansons said, ``I know
very many Russians who support independence. It is possible that
there will be a good economic situation after independence, and
that will bring peace.''
   At the other end of Riga's central Lenin Street stood a massive
statue of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin. The statue, standing
deserted, was caked with grime from the passing traffic.

<HEAD>Love-Triangle Murder, Grant's Menagerie: Lafayette Square Saw it

<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists admiring the grassy serenity of
Lafayette Square little suspect that it once was the site of a
love-triangle murder, Helen Hayes' stage debut and a makeshift zoo
where Ulysses S. Grant kept a menagerie of deer and prairie dogs.
   Some of the ``secrets of Lafayette Square,'' both amusing and
tragic, were disclosed Wednesday during a historical tour of the
seven-acre park opposite the White House. The tour was sponsored by
the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
   According to tour guide Sarah Shaffer, the square that is
inhabited today by homeless vagrants and anti-nuclear demonstrators
once was surrounded by elegant hotels and clubs and the homes of
prominent Washington figures.
   The square is no stranger to scandal. More than a century before
the Watergate scandal engulfed the Nixon White House, a lurid sex
scandal resulted in the death of the son of Francis Scott Key, who
wrote ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   Phillip Barton Key was fond of crossing the square from his
boarding house to visit the wife of Daniel Sickles, a New York
congressman, when she waved an all-clear signal from her bedroom
window. Sickles, enraged at the discovery of his wife's infidelity,
killed Key with a shotgun blast in 1859.
   On the east side of the square lived Dolley Madison, the
destitute widow of James Madison, who had to mortgage her house
before Henry Clay persuaded Congress to give her $20,000 to pay off
her debt to John Jacob Astor.
   Nearby is the site of the old Belasco Theater, a vaudeville
palace where actress Helen Hayes made her first stage appearance as
a 5-year-old singer.
   On the northeastern edge of the square, where the Department of
Veterans Affairs has its headquarters, stood the posh Arlington
Hotel, where industrialist Andrew Carnegie once spent $10,000 on a
dinner party for his friends.
   The park originally contained a private farmhouse, apple orchard
and graveyard before it was bought in 1791 to help create the
capital city envisioned by George Washington.
   It served as the unkempt front lawn of the executive mansion for
a while, until Thomas Jefferson ordered Pennsylvania Avenue built
right through the middle. It was a military campground in the War
of 1812 and again during the Civil War, when President Lincoln
crossed the street to visit troops guarding the White House.
   The President's Park was renamed Lafayette Square during the
French military hero's visit to the United States in 1824. But it
is Andrew Jackson _ not Lafayette _ who is honored with an
equestrian statue in the center of the park.
   The statue was cast at a local foundry from melted-down British
cannons seized in the War of 1812. It was unveiled in 1853 and
celebrated by spectators who toasted ``Old Hickory'' from open kegs
of rum and whiskey.
   The square was haunted by tragedy, too.
   Conspirators in Lincoln's assassination in 1865 bungled an
attempt to kill Secretary of State William Seward in his home on
Lafayette Square. Although Seward survived, his wife and daughter
died of ``nervous prostration'' shortly after the attack.
   In a home on the present site of the Hay-Adams Hotel on the
northern edge of the square, Clover Adams, daughter-in-law of John
Quincy Adams, committed suicide by drinking chemicals from her
rooftop photography lab.
   Long before the square was beautified with fountains and floral
gardens, President Grant had the park drained and landscaped,
removed a Civil War cemetery and installed his pet deer and prairie
dogs.
   Grant's zoo was closed when the neighbors complained of the
noise and stench.
   The tour was part of local observances of National Historic
Preservation Week, an annual event sponsored by the non-profit
National Trust to encourage public support of efforts to preserve
buildings, objects and sites of historic significance.

   One of France's high-speed trains broke its own
world speed record, traveling at 317.4 mph.
   The new record set Wednesday was one-tenth of a mile an hour
better than the previous record of 317.3 mph, set last week by the
same train.
   The records were set during a series of trial runs by the
government-owned railroad to test new equipment, materials and
track.
   Last week's record marked the first time any train has traveled
faster than 300 mph. The tests are taking place on a stretch of
track near Tours in central France.
   On regular passenger runs, the high-speed trains normally travel
at a maximum of 180 mph.

   Drug czar William J. Bennett, who is on a
crusade against crack dealers, took a swipe at a celluloid bad boy
_ Bart Simpson.
   During a tour Wednesday of the Foundation for Abraxas
drug-treatment center, Bennett spied a poster of the cartoon
miscreant and told recovering addicts they shouldn't follow Bart's
lead as an underachiever.
   ``You guys aren't watching `The Simpsons,' are you? That's not
going to help you any,'' said Bennett, director of the national
drug policy office.
   Bart is the spike-haired son on ``The Simpsons,'' the Fox
network's highly rated cartoon sitcom featuring the adventures of a
bug-eyed family of five.
   ``We have great respect for Mr. Bennett's task and
responsibility,'' said Brad Turell, a spokesman for the show. ``But
I am not aware of any one TV program that will help teen-agers kick
the drug habit.''

   Kelsey Grammer, who plays the uptight Dr.
Frasier Crane on ``Cheers,'' was given 30 days in jail for
violating his probation from a 1988 drunken driving arrest.
   Municipal Court Commissioner Patricia Schwartz on Wednesday told
the 35-year-old actor to report to jail May 24 and enroll in a
90-day alcohol rehabilitation program.
   The actor had violated terms of his probation by missing a court
appearance to report on his progress.
   Grammer's co-star Kirstie Alley pleaded unsuccessfully with Ms.
Schwartz to spare the actor jail and instead enroll him in a strict
alcohol and drug abuse program.

   Anita Bryant, the former Florida orange
juice woman and campaigner against gay rights, calls herself a
``walking miracle'' for having survived a nervous breakdown, pill
addiction and divorce.
   Bryant, a pop singer in the 1960s, moved to Nashville from
Selma, Ala., in August to get back into the business. She just
finished an album called ``With Love'' and is working on her 11th
inspirational book.
   ``I know that I am a walking miracle,'' she said in an interview
published Wednesday in The Tennessean. ``You know how you read
about the `points' you get if you have trauma in your life? I've
got enough trauma points to have died and resurrected about three
times. So I know I'm here by God's grace.''
   Bryan said she had suffered a breakdown, financial woes woes and
addiction to pills.
   In 1977, she took part in a campaign to block a Miami ordinance
that would have prevented job discrimination against homosexuals.
   When her marriage ended in divorce 10 years ago, the same people

   Geraldine Ferarro told a gathering of
Korean women to fight to enter politics, saying women's voices are
essential to good government.
   ``That's not necessarily because we are more caring or more
effective, but because we bring another dimension to the political
process,'' the former vice presidential candidate said at the
meeting Wednesday at the National Assembly. ``Instead of engaging
in confrontation, women are more apt to negotiate.''
   Mrs. Park Young-sook, a vice president of the opposition party,
said Ferraro was invited to speak as a role model.
   There are six women in South Korea's 299-member parliament, but
all are appointed by their parties, not elected.
   The former congresswoman ran with Democrat Walter Mondale in
1984. She said she would decide next year whether to run for the
Senate.

   City Council gave landmark status to the studios
where two Polish immigrants launched urban rock 'n' roll by
recording the likes of Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley.
   The council voted unanimously Wednesday to honor Chess Studios,
the two-story, brick and terra cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan
Ave. where Berry recorded ``Johnny B. Goode,'' Howlin' Wolf cut
``Spoonful'' and Waters laid down ``I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man.''
   ``I think it's one of the greatest honors bestowed upon us,''
Phil Chess said in a telephone interview from his Tucson, Ariz.,
home. ``I just wish my brother was around to accept the honor,
really, but that's life.''
   Phil and Leonard Chess created the label in 1950, and in 1957
moved the studios to Michigan Avenue, across the street from the
old Lexington Hotel, gangster Al Capone's one-time headquarters.
   Chess' urban blues and rock 'n' roll made its way across the
Atlantic and came back transformed by British rock groups.
   The Rolling Stones took their name from Waters' 1950 Chess
record ``Rolling Stone.'' In 1964, they recorded cuts for their
``12 x 5'' album at Chess, including the song ``2120 South Michigan
Avenue.''
   Chess flourished until 1969, when the family sold the operation.
Leonard Chess died that year. The Chess catalog is now owned by MCA
Records.

<HEAD>Hatch Says Wide Approval Vote Will Affect Bush Budget Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overwhelming Senate vote for a nearly $3
billion bill to help states and cities cope with AIDS expenses will
encourage President Bush to find room for the spending in the
federal budget, a key Republican backer says.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he believe White House officials
will drop any reservations about the bill's cost when they hold
budget deliberations with congressional leaders, in part because of
the breadth of the Senate's 95-4 vote Wednesday.
   ``I think basically they wanted to see how the bill would
ultimately sift out. They now know, at least from the Senate
standpoint,'' Hatch said.
   ``We're very hopeful ... that the White House will see the
merits of it and will help to include it in the summit agreement.
And I have no doubt that they will,'' he said.
   Hatch, a leading conservative, joined with liberal Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., in sponsoring the AIDS bill.
   The measure now goes to the House, where a similar but bigger
version awaits floor action. Lobbyists for AIDS groups were
optimistic about its chances there.
   The Senate's bill would provide $600 million a year in the 1991
and 1992 fiscal years to cities and states to deal with AIDS
patients overburdening many public hospitals.
   Half the money would go to 13 big cities that have reported
2,000 or more cases of AIDS.
   It would authorize spending ``such sums as may be necessary''
for three more years, through fiscal 1995. The Congressional Budget
Office estimated the bill would increase federal outlays by $2.9
billion over five years.
   The bill was approved after three days of debate and a long
series of amendments. It was vigorously opposed by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who charged money was being diverted from other
diseases and that the bill would encourage homosexual practices,
which he termed immoral.
   Joining Helms to vote against the bill were Sens. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; William Roth, R-Del., and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
Not voting was Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   The Senate accepted an amendment establishing 150 new Food and
Drug Administration inspectors as a step to ensure the blood supply
used by hospitals is free of the AIDS virus.
   It also approved another amendment barring local governments
from using any federal money provided by the bill for needle
distribution to users of illegal drugs. A stronger Helms amendment,
to bar cities or states from distributing either needles or
syringe-cleaning bleach, was defeated.
   The Senate rejected, 52-47, another Helms amendment that would
have made it a federal crime to knowingly donate blood tainted by
the AIDS virus, or for intravenous drug users or prostitutes to
give blood.
   It accepted a milder version, requiring that states have laws
``adequate to prosecute'' anyone who knowingly and intentionally
tries to donate tainted blood.
   The AIDS virus is transmitted through blood and other body
fluids, and homosexual contact and illegal intravenous drug use are
primary transmitters.
   The National Commission on AIDS, whose members are appointed by
Congress and the president, said in a statement that it ``endorses
the principles and objectives'' of the Senate's bill. A spokesman,
Thomas Brandt, said the commission similarly supported the House
bill.
   The 13 big cities are to receive half the money in the first
year, and $150 million of that in the first 60 days after
enactment. Those cities, and congressional estimates of their
first-round allocation, are:
   Atlanta, $4.7 million; Boston, $3.5 million; Chicago $5 million;
Dallas, $3.8 million; Houston, $6.6 million; Los Angeles, $15.8
million; Miami, $6.8 million; New York, $56.3 million; Newark,
N.J., $7.7 million; Philadelphia, $4.4 million; San Francisco,
$23.5 million; San Juan, Puerto Rico, $5.8 million; and Washington
D.C., $6.4 million.
   Those cities will be eligible to apply for a second round of
$150 million later in the first year of the bill.
   The other half of the bill's money would go to states. The money
would be used to care for AIDS patients and to provide
community-based services and support programs.

   The annual assembly of the World Health
Organization warned there could be up to 3 million tobacco-related
deaths per year during the 1990s and called for a stepped-up
anti-smoking campaign.
   The resolution, adopted on Wednesday without a vote, suggested
raising taxes on tobacco among proposals to discourage smoking.
   It also urged ``concerted action to eliminate eventually all
direct and indirect advertising, promotion and sponsorship
concerning tobacco.''
   Member nations, including the United States, also were urged to
consider measures to protect non-smokers exposed to smoke in public.
   The resolution said unless current smoking rates decrease, there
will be 3 million tobacco-related deaths per year during the
1990's. It did not give the current rate.
   An increasing number of Americans have kicked the habit, but
smoking is still on the rise especially in many developing
countries.
   The resolution was initiated by New Zealand and had 23
co-sponsors.

<NOTE>EDS: House-Senate negotiations resume 10 a.m. EDT; lead prospects

   The Bush administration, worried that 14,000
Nicaraguan Contras may run out of food, has come up with a
contingency plan to feed the rebels for a month, U.S. officials say.
   The administration had hoped that Congress would have approved
by now a $300 million Nicaragua aid proposal that includes food
supplies for the Contras, and President Bush complained on
Wednesday about ``procedural gridlock'' on Capitol Hill.
   As a stopgap measure, the administration is expected to take
between $1 million and $1.5 million from aid programs to other
countries in order to help feed the Contras, said the U.S.
officials, who asked not to be identified.
   Democrats indicated Wednesday that it was unlikely the aid
requested by the administration would be passed before the end of
next week when Congress is scheduled to begin its Memorial Day
recess. But at a news conference, Bush urged lawmakers to stay
through the holiday weekend to complete the bill.
   The package also includes $420 million for Panama's
five-month-old government. Bush blasted Congress for piling on
scores of domestic spending proposals ``that have nothing to do
with Panama and Nicaragua.''
   One of the most controversial amendments would approve use of
local tax dollars for abortions in the District of Columbia. The
president said he would veto any bill including such a provision.
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to resolve differing
versions of the bill passed by their chambers.
   Democrats said Bush was using the aid package as a foil to
divert attention from problems facing his administration, such as
looming budget deficits.
   ``He should be concerned with his deficits'' as he is with aid
for Central America, said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich. Health care,
education, taxes and budget were the pressing issues in his
district _ not foreign aid, Bonior said.
   As part of an elaborate peace plan, the Contras have assembled
in five security zones that are off-limits to soldiers of the
Sandinista army of Nicaragua. About $30 million of the $300 million
would be used for humanitarian aid for the Contras and resettling
them back to their home towns.
   But officials of the Organization of American States who are
assisting in the resettlement process report that only a few days'
supply of food remain.
   The officials declined to say which countries would be affected
by the proposed transfer, known as ``reprogramming'' in diplomatic
jargon.
   State Department lawyers were attempting to determine whether it
would be legal for the administration to give back the funds to the
countries originally earmarked for the aid once Congress approves
the aid package.
   What worries the administration is that the food problem facing
the Contras could unravel the Nicaraguan peace process.
   The administration has said that the Contras, if they are
deprived of food, might leave the security zones in search of fresh
supplies, raising the possibility that they could come in contact
with the Sandinista Army.
   Even though political power in Nicaragua has passed from the
leftist Sandinista government to U.S.-backed President Violeta
Chamorro, the loyalties of the Sandinista army remain uncertain.
   The hostility between the Sandinistas and the Contras remains
strong after 10 years of warfare, and officials are worried about
renewed armed conflict if the rebels leave the safety of the
security zones.
   Bush said he has exhausted all administrative avenues for
providing aid to Nicaragua and cannot legally grant Mrs. Chamorro's
request for an emergency $40 million loan. The Treasury Department
cannot make such loans without assurance Nicaragua would get U.S.
aid or other revenues to pay it back.
   Democrats said conservative Republicans were the villains in the
tangled legislative web because they had rejected a compromise on
strings attached to military aid to El Salvador measure, even
though the State Department was willing to negotiate.
   As a result, the Democrats have attached the El Salvador measure
to an aid authorization bill, setting the stage for a floor fight
when the measure comes before the full House next Monday.
   Democrats are insisting that the authorization bill be passed
before any money flows to Nicaragua and Panama. Along with that
measure, lawmakers would have to pass an appropriations bill
providing the actual dollars.
   The El Salvador proposal would condition aid to the U.S.-backed
government of President Alfredo Cristiani in an attempt to
encourage his government and leftist rebels to negotiate peace in
the Central American country.
   The measure would hold back 50 percent of the 1990 military aid,
which totals $85 million. It would do the same for military aid in
1991.

<HEAD>N.J. Chief Justice Sued Over His Ban on `Bonfire of Vanities'
Filming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Wolfe's novel ``The Bonfire of the
Vanities'' includes headline-grabbing politicians, zealous
journalists and an unyielding judge.
   Life imitated art on Wednesday, when Essex County Executive
Nicholas Amato announced at a packed news conference that the
county is suing New Jersey Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz.
   Wilentz barred film crews from the county courthouse because he
said the script for the movie version of ``Bonfire'' called for a
scene that showed blacks acting in ``a riotous, lawless and
life-threatening manner.''
   Angry over the loss of $250,000 in filming fees, Amato sued.
   The American Civil Liberties Union joined the lawsuit,
contending that the chief justice is interfering in the
moviemakers' First Amendment right of free expression.
   ``He's violating the First Amendment,'' Amato said. ``He's also
costing the taxpayers in Essex County a lot of money, and for
what?''
   Carl Golden, a spokesman for the state courts, said Wilentz has
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
   ``His position hasn't changed, though,'' Golden said. ``It's
important to remember that the chief justice is not saying you
can't make a move. He's saying is he won't allow a courtroom for
this particular scene.''
   Warner Bros. has no part in the lawsuit. The movie studio said
it doesn't have the time to wait for the matter to be settled to
complete the scene.
   ``The suit's not something that's going to make the filming of
the movie any easier, and that's what we want to do, make a
movie,'' said Warner spokesman Rob Harris.
   The movie is based on the Wolfe novel about a white Wall Street
bond salesman, Sherman McCoy, who is thrust into the New York
City's Bronx court system after he accidentally kills a black youth
in an auto accident.
   Wilentz objects to a scene that shows a metal gate being slammed
in the faces of a black mob after the charges against McCoy are
dismissed.
   ``What the scene depicts is rage over the outcome,'' said
Harris. ``The judge seemed to think that that rage could be
conveyed through two people engaged in dialogue.
   ``If he really thinks that, I wouldn't want to see any movie he
would direct.''
   The lawsuit says Wilentz is ``unlawfully seeking to censor,
restrict and regulate the content of the movie.'' It asks that
Wilentz be barred from prohibiting use of the courthouse and seeks
unspecified damages.
   Earlier this month, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer
objected to the New York courthouse being used for filming,
complaining that the movie painted the area as dangerous.
   In response, Warner Bros. offered to run a statement at the end
of the movie saying it was based on fiction.
   Back in New Jersey, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People defended Wilentz's actions, saying it's
``reprehensible'' for public property to be ``party to perpetuating
racist stereotypes.''

<BYLINE>Exposure to Light May Ease Depression and Other Disorders, Studies
Suggest
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A treatment with bright lights that can ease
wintertime depression is showing promise for nonseasonal depression
too, although why it works is a mystery, a scientist says.
   It may work by adjusting the timing of internal body activities
or by replacing the sunlight missed by people who spend most of the
day indoors, said Dr. Daniel Kripke.
   He discussed the topic Wednesday in a news conference at the
annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Other
speakers reported preliminary success in using light therapy for
premenstrual syndrome and for chronic inability to fall asleep at a
reasonable hour.
   Kripke, of the University of California, San Diego, and other
researchers tested light therapy on 51 veterans who were
hospitalized for depression.
   Twenty-five patients were exposed to bright white light, usually
from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., every night for a week. The 26 others
received a placebo treatment of dim red light for those hours.
   At the end of the week, patients who received the experimental
treatment showed significant lessening of depression, while those
on the placebo did not improve, Kripke said.
   The benefit was probably better than a medication could do in a
week, he said. Drugs require several weeks to reach full
effectiveness, and it is not yet clear how light therapy would
compare in a longer-term study, he said.
   Still, ``I think there's a real effect here,'' said Norman
Rosenthal of the National Institute of Mental Health. It will take
more work to tell how useful light therapy could be, he said, but
in treating depression, ``you take anything you can get.''
   Light treatment was in the news earlier this month when
researchers announced it could help night-shift workers avoid
daytime insomnia and on-the-job sleepiness.
   One study presented Wednesday suggests light treatment may also
help people whose sleep troubles are caused not by their jobs, but
by an internal abnormality.
   People with ``delayed sleep phase syndrome'' are chronically
unable to fall asleep when they want to at night, which makes them
groggy the next morning at work or school, said Dr. Jean
Joseph-Vanderpool of the mental health institute. Some may stay
awake until 5 a.m. or so, he said.
   They may drink four or five cups of coffee a day to stay awake
in the morning, and may abuse medications or alcohol in their
attempts to fall asleep sooner at night, he said. Children with the
disorder may be considered lazy or irresponsible by their parents,
he said.
   Nobody knows how common the disorder is, although one study
found it in 7 percent of a group of New York high school students,
he said.
   Joseph-Vanderpool and colleagues tried light treatment in 20
patients. Each was exposed daily for two weeks to bright light from
7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and wore dark goggles from 4 p.m. to dusk.
   The experimental treatment helped the subjects fall asleep about
two hours earlier and feel more alert between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.,
Joseph-Vanderpool said.
   The approach is ``a very reasonable thing to try to do,'' said
sleep expert Merrill Mitler of the Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation in La Jolla, Calif.
   The basic cause of the sleep abnormality is not known for sure,
he said in a telephone interview.
   In another study, Dr. Barbara Perry of the University of
California, San Diego, said light therapy showed promise in
relieving depressive symptoms of pre-menstrual disorder.
   The condition can also include such symptoms as sudden mood
shifts, irritability, difficulty concentrating and decreased
interest in one's usual activities. Symptoms appear in the week
before menstruation.
   Perhaps 5 percent of women with menstrual cycles have symptoms
severe enough to interfere with their daily lives, Parry said.
   In her study, six patients were treated with bright light in the
morning for two hours daily for a week during their premenstrual
phase.
   They showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, she
said.
   She cautioned that the work must be repeated to better assess
its promise. But the approach may someday replace or add to
medications for some people with the disorder, she said.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Backs Compensation for Vets With Agent Orange-Related
Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam veterans who suffered cancer and other
diseases after exposure to Agent Orange should receive disability
payments, says a government adviser who had ordered spraying of the
herbicide.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. told a Department of Veterans
Affairs advisory panel that he believed 27 cases of illness, mostly
cancers, could be sufficiently linked to Agent Orange exposure to
justify compensation.
   Zumwalt spoke to the Environmental Hazards Advisory Committee as
its newest member and as a personal adviser to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski Jr.
   The committee on Wednesday began reviewing scientific evidence
on the health effects of Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt speaks from a unique perspective: as commander of naval
forces in Vietnam, he ordered the spraying of the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide, which was used to deny jungle cover
to the enemy.
   In addition, Zumwalt's son, who served in Vietnam, died of a
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure, and a grandson has birth
defects linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt urged the panel to take a fresh look at the scientific
evidence on Agent Orange. He also said a study he conducted for
Derwinski parallels the work of an independent group of scientists
hired by three veterans' groups.
   That group, the Agent Orange Task Force, said this month there
was enough evidence to justify compensation for eight diseases or
ailments that have been linked to exposure. The panel said there
were 13 other health problems, mostly cancers, for which there is
sound evidence of connection but not yet enough evidence to justify
compensation.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' Zumwalt said. He contended the VA panel lcked a
systematic approach or epidemiological perspective.
   Zumwalt went further, saying he believes 27 ailments, mostly
cancers, could be compensated using VA criteria that were adopted
as the result of a court order last year.
   The main diseases cited by the task force, Zumwalt and others
are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, soft tissue sarcoma,
chloracne and other skin disorders, liver disorders, a metabolic
disorder known as porphyria cutanea tarda and birth defects.
   Zumwalt's list includes 13 kinds of cancer in addition to those
already cited.
   The VA has said it will come up with final rules this year on
compensation. Derwinski must make the decision based on the
recommendations of the 15-member advisory committee, a panel of
scientists and lay people.
   The VA decided in March to award compensation for 1,800 Vietnam
veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on a
Centers for Disease Control study that found an increased risk of
the disease among Vietnam veterans as a whole. The study was
inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   About 36,000 claimants have been denied compensation despite
their contention that Agent Orange exposure caused their health
problems. About 240,000 say they have been exposed to the herbicide.
   The Zumwalt statement heartened congressional Vietnam-era
veterans who have pushed for legislation to award compensation.
   ``The evidence is there,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``The
only question left is whether or not the federal government is
willing to accept its responsibility.''

   Sweden's leading brewers say they will
lower the alcohol level in their beer, after the government said it
may increase taxes on alcohol and link them to the potency of the
brew.
   But the brewers insist their decision is because of taste, not
taxes.
   The five main brewers said they will reduce the alcohol content
in their strongest beer from 4.5 to 4 percent.
   ``The taste is better at a lower level,'' said Katrin Andersson
at the Swedish Brewers' Association.
   Authorities said the proposed tax increase would cut alcohol
consumption by 10 percent. The government backs World Health
Organization's goal to cut consumption by 25 percent before the
year 2000.
   Swedes can buy beer in three strengths. The two weaker beers are
available in supermarkets. The strongest beer is sold in state
stores at government-set prices.

   A paralyzing strike by public
employees ened Wednesday night when the new government agreed to
double workers' salaries and promised not to fire those who walked
off the job.
   The agreement included a 100 percent pay raise beginning next
month to workers belonging to Sandinista unions.
   The workers went on strike Friday, demanding a 200 percent pay
raise and restoration of a law under the former leftist Sandinista
government that protected public employees from being fired.
   The walkout virtually shut down Managua and much of this Central
American nation of 3.5 million residents, three weeks after the
Sandinistas turned over power to conservative President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro on April 25.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales read the agreement to reporters
Wednesday night. Other details of the accord were not immediately
available.
   Earlier Wednesday, the beleaguered Chamorro government reached
tentative accord with Sandinista labor leaders to end some of the
crippling strikes by government employees.
   But most of her 3-week-old administration remained frozen by the
walkouts, and suffered a further blow when President Bush said
Wednesday that legally his administration cannot provide $40
million she sought in emergency loans.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo had described the situation as
``very difficult.'' He met Wednesday with former President Daniel
Ortega.
   Ortega later told reporters Obando agreed to his request to
intercede with the government so negotiations do not break down,
and would also ask that talks be held between the government and
Sandinistas to discuss other issues, such as demobilization of the
rebels, known as Contras, and agrarian reform.
   Obando said he agreed because, ``We must seek a climate of
reconciliation.''
   ``The national panorama is very tense because of the strike, and
the pot could explode if more wood is fed into the fire,'' Obando
told reporters.
   Most government workers are Sandinista holdovers of the Ortega
government.
   Bush told a news conference in Washington that Nicaragua is
``absolutely bankrupt'' and asked Congress to act quickly on
pending legislation providing $300 million in aid to the
U.S.-backed government.
   But he said of Mrs. Chamorro's request for a loan to get her
through the immediate financial crisis: ``I can't provide that,
because the Nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment.''
   In earlier talks, strike leaders reduced their demand for salary
increases from 200 to 180 percent and the government responded by
doubling its offer to 120 percent. Union leaders said they accepted
the lower 100 percent figure to do their part to fight raging
inflation.
   Both sides agreed to review labor contracts and other pending
issues and work together to reform a job-protection civil service
law the Sandinistas enacted shortly before leaving office last
month after nearly 11 years in power.
   Mrs. Chamorro then proposed to rehire labor leaders fired last
week and rescind an order declaring the strike illegal.
   Mrs. Chamorro, Labor Minister Francisco Rosales and their
advisers worked out the tentative accord with leaders Lucio Jimenez
and Jose Angel Bermudez of the Sandinista-dominated General
Federation of State Employees, federation spokesman Douglas Diaz
told The Associated Press.
   Nicaraguan and U.S. government officials have accused the
Sandinistas, who were defeated in Feb. 25 elections, of trying to
undermine the conservative Chamorro administration.
   Until Wednesday, Ortega and other Sandinista Front leaders were
conspicuously quiet about the strike.
   Railroad workers on Wednesday resumed supplying crude oil to
refineries to prevent a fuel shortage, but the rest of the
administration continued to be at a virtual standstill.
   Managua's international airport, schools and banks remained
closed. Public transportation was next to nothing and thousands of
people were stranded. About 20 buses were running in the capital.
   Public hospitals were open but at least one limited treatment to
the very old or young, pregnant women and emergency cases.
   In messaging Bush on May 11 to ask for emergency aid, Mrs.
Chamorro said, ``My country is bankrupt,'' and that inflation was
running at 70 percent monthly.
   Administration officials said they inherited an economy ravaged
by years of Sandinista rule and U.S. economic sanctions, with only
$3 million left in the treasury, and an $11 billion foreign debt.
   A municipal construction worker makes about $10 a month at the
parallel market exchange rate, a secretary $70, a technician $140
and the deputy manager of a state-owned bank $350 a month. The
parallel rate is the one most people use to buy and sell dollars.
The official rate is a preferential rate used for key imports and
exports.

<HEAD>Yun's Town: Movie Shows Koreans as Second-Class People in Japan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A movie shows a spirited 16-year-old high school
student being raped and beaten by teenage thugs hired by the
younger sister of her boyfriend.
   Why? She's a Korean in Japan.
   The victim is the heroine of ``Yun's Town,'' directed by Kim
U-son, a lifelong Korean resident of Japan. Although the attack is
fictional, Kim says it symbolizes the discrimination against the
nearly 700,000 Koreans who live in Japan.
   Acrimony between Japan and its neighbors on the Korean peninsula
dates back centuries, and scars are still visible from the 1910-45
era when Japan ruled Korea as a colony. Many of the Koreans who
live in Japan today are either those brought over as forced
laborers or their descendants.
   The bitterness has emerged in a series of events preceding the
May 23 state visit of Roh Tas-woo _ only the second such trip to
Japan by a South Korean president.
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he will apologize
for Japan's colonial rule, but some Koreans want the apology to
come from Emperor Akihito _ a demand resisted by Japan's governing
party.
   Under Japanese rule, Koreans were told to worship the emperor's
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and they were forced to learn
Japanese in school. Some were drafted into the Japanese army, and
many died during the war.
   In South Korea, opposition parties and others have urged Roh to
stay at home.
   Last month, under pressure from Roh, Japan agreed to throw out a
fingerprinting requirement for the most recent generation of
Koreans in Japan. But the decision affects only four infants _ the
grandchildren of those who registered as residents as of 1971.
   Fingerprinting is just one of many measures that put ethnic
Koreans at a disadvantage in Japan's homogenous society.
   Many ethnic Koreans are lifelong Japanese residents, but they
cannot vote or apply for civil service jobs. They face deportation
if they commit serious crimes, and find it almost impossible to
obtain jobs as public school teachers. Like other foreigners in
Japan, they are forced to register as aliens and cannot become
citizens without adopting Japanese names.
   Outside the South Korean Embassy in Tokyo, radical rightist
groups regularly jeer ``Koreans Go Home!'' through loudspeakers.
   As in the movie ``Yun's Town'' there are many cases of Korean
junior high and high school students being bullied.
   Ironically for those who see the movie as an indictment of a
racist culture, Kim says he made ``Yun's Town'' to show a brighter
side of the Korean people.
   ``The stereotypes about Koreans in Japan are that they feel
nothing but bitterness and hatred toward Japanese because they are
objects of discrimination,'' said the 37-year-old director.
   ``I wanted to make a movie that showed flesh-and-blood people,
Koreans who can delight in life and communicate on an equal footing
with Japanese,'' said Kim, who shot the movie in a Korean ghetto in
Osaka, where he was born.
   While planning the $760,000 movie, Kim went to major Japanese
studios, but all refused financing.
   This says as much about self-censorship within the movie
industry as it does about discrimination against Koreans, Kim
maintains.
   Koreans are not the only film taboos, Kim says. Films on atom
bomb victims are also off limits. ``To make such movies is to point
a finger at Emperor Hirohito, and film makers and studios fear
this,'' Kim says.
   What they fear is attacks on their theaters by radical rightists
who revere the imperial family.
   Kim finally got the funds he needed from Korean investors in
Japan and from a group of Japanese artists and actors.
   Despite applause from the critics, Kim encountered difficulties
in getting the movie distributed. It was shown in only a dozen
theaters.
   Nonetheless, Kim won the new director's award last year from the
Japan Film Directors Association _ the first time it had ever gone
to a non-Japanese.
   The government Culture Agency also gave the director a $63,000
grant.
   ``Yun's Town'' was shown at the Cannes film festival in France
last year and at several other major festivals, including the
Hawaii International Film Festival, where it was one of five
nominees for the top award.
   ``Japanese nowadays say it's an international era in Japan, but
I don't think there's internationalization here at all. There are
Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos living here, but Japanese treat us as
if we don't exist,'' Kim says.

   A children's advocacy organization says it
will help low-income households install safety devices on their
sinks, bathtubs and showers that will shut off the water when it
gets hot enough to burn a small child.
   The change in plumbing fixtures is urged in a program begun
Wednesday by the National Safe Kids Campaign to help prevent
instances that daily send 100 children to hospital emergency rooms
nationwide for treatment of scald burns.
   The coalition also said it would work to amend local plumbing
and construction codes to include stricter regulations for fixtures
that control water temperatures and regulate water pressure.
   ``In less than the time it takes you to answer the telephone in
an adjoining room,'' a child can be suffer a serious disfiguring
burn from tap water, hot beverages or food when left unattended,
Dr. C. Everett Koop, Safe Kids chairman and former U.S. surgeon
general, said in announcing the program.
   ``It happens all the time. Every day 100 children are taken to
emergency rooms with scald burns in this country,'' Koop said. This
year ``37,000 children, under the age of 14, will be injured by a
scald burn severely enough to receive emergency medical treatment.''
   ``What gives us a little red mark can give a small child a
first- or second-degree burn,'' said Ann Parsons, a nurse in the
burn unit at Children's National Medical Center here.
   Safe Kids will help provide anti-scald spring-activated safety
valves for plumbing fixtures in low-income homes with children
under five at a cost of $5 each. The program will include
installations in 200 units at Washington's Highland Terrace public
housing development in Washington, D.C. Low-income residents can
contact Safe Kids at 202-939-4993.
   Children from low-income homes, especially those living on the
lower floors of public housing or multiple-family dwellings, are
often scald burn victims because the water temperature is raised to
extremely high levels to provide adequate hot water to upper floors.
   The safety devices, produced solely by Connecticut-based Memry
Corp., operate on a spring device that automatically shuts off the
flow of water to individual fixtures when the temperature reaches
120 degrees Fahrenheit. Other consumers can order the devices by
telephone from Memry at 1-800-782-7840.
   The average cost for retrofitting fixtures in older homes is $13
per sink, $17 per shower and $40 per bathtub.

<HEAD>New Book Alleges Unreported Deaths Linked to Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radiation releases from nuclear plants and
bomb tests may have contributed to the deaths of millions more
Americans than acknowledged by the government, say the authors of a
new book.
   A spokeswoman for the commercial nuclear industry called the
assertion ``hysterical fear-mongering.'' Some independent
scientists dismissed the book as invalid.
   ``It just doesn't make any sense scientifically,'' said Bernard
L. Cohen, a professor of physics and radiation health at the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Benjamin A. Goldman and Jay M. Gould, authors of ``Deadly
Deceit,'' said Wednesday that government mortality and radiation
statistics showed that death rates for infants and the elderly rose
significantly after accidental radiation releases at nuclear plants
in South Carolina, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in the 1970s.
   Goldman, a researcher and author, and Gould, a statistician,
also claim that radioactive fallout from the explosion of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union in April 1986
accelerated the deaths of about 40,000 Americans during the summer
of 1986.
   As the basis for this claim, the authors cited government
statistics that showed a 5.3 percent increase in reported U.S.
deaths in May 1986 compared with May 1985. They said this was the
biggest May increase in 50 years and that the odds of this being a
chance event unrelated to Chernobyl were less than one in 1,000.
   The book also contends that deaths related to fallout from
above-ground nuclear tests, which were banned in 1963, may be far
in excess of any previous estimates.
   The authors reached this conclusion on the basis of national
mortality tables that showed a steady decline in death rates in the
United States until the 1950s, when the rate flattened out. The
rate resumed falling after the early 1960s.
   This 10-year period of little or no improvement in the death
rate coincided with the height of the U.S. and Soviet atmospheric
nuclear testing programs.
   ``We have estimated that this mid-century mortality failure
could have been measured as equivalent to 9 million `excess'
deaths, as the difference between the observed number and what
would be expected on the basis of pre-1950s trends,'' Gould said at
a news conference.
   The authors said they could not be entirely sure of the accuracy
of their conclusions since they were formed on the basis of
``statistical anomalies'' and not scientific investigation of links
between radiation doses and human health.
   ``If it is not low-level radiation that caused this, then it is
up to the scientific community to explain what in God's name
accounted for this,'' Gould said.
   Cathy Roche, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, a nuclear industry trade group, said the assertions by
Gould and Goldman had been made previously and debunked by state
and federal health authorities. She said the authors have an
anti-nuclear bias that skewed their analysis.
   Dr. Henry Wagner of the Division of Nuclear Medicine and
Radiation Health Sciences at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution in
Baltimore said the analysis by Gould and Goldman was incorrect
because it did not account for other factors that affect mortality
rates, such as poverty.
   ``I think the book is totally invalid,'' Wagner said.

<HEAD>House Takes Up Rights Bill for Disabled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation guaranteeing the civil rights of
at least 43 million disabled Americans was up for House action
today.
   Hailed widely as the most significant civil rights legislation
since the 1960s, the Americans With Disabilities Act was considered
certain to pass.
   The bill handily cleared all four House committees that have
jurisdiction over it. The Senate passed the measure last September
by a 76-8 vote.
   More recently, President Bush urged its quick passage, although
the administration objects to a key proposal _ how to punish
employers violate the law. One section of the bill could make it
possible for employers to be sued for damages.
   ``Disabled citizens have waited long enough for equality,'' Bush
said earlier this month.
   The bill that emerged from negotiations last year with the White
House prohibits discrimination in employment and guarantees access
to business and professional services. It requires that buses,
trains and other mass transit be made accessible to disabled
people, including those in wheelchairs. Telephone service also
would have to be made available for people who are hearing- or
speech-impaired.
   To soften the economic impact, the bill includes a number of
timetables and exemptions.
   For example, businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be
exempt from the job protection provisions. Those provisions take
effect after two years for businesses with 25 or more employees,
after four years for those with 15 to 24 workers.
   Modifications to accommodate disabled employees could not cause
an ``undue hardship.''
   Also, adjustments to existing buildings or offices to make them
accessible to disabled patrons or clients would have to be ``easily
accomplishable without much difficulty or expense.''
   Amendments may be introduced that are aimed at giving more
breaks to small businesses.
   Other amendments could focus on the definition of disability,
which by case law includes people with infectious diseases,
including AIDS.
   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, wants employers in the food service
industry to be able to reassign workers with a contagious disease
so they won't be handling food.
   Such amendments would cover AIDS along with other diseases, even
though AIDS is not transmitted by such casual contact.
   But Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said in a Rules Committee
hearing Tuesday, restaurants would lose customers because of the
misperceptions surrounding HIV infection.
   He said the proposed amendment ``resolves a very practical and
difficult question of equities.''

   The United States and Arab countries are
suspending efforts to negotiate a United Nations resolution
criticizing Israeli settlements in occupied territory as a
violation of international law, U.S. officials say.
   The Arab nations were hoping to come up with a Security Council
resolution that would criticize Israel and not be vetoed by the
United States. But the effort was abandoned partly because the Arab
diplomats were unable to overcome differences over wording with
U.S. negotiators, American officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday.
   Israel had protested the joint U.S.-Arab efforts. The New
York-based Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations
issued a statement saying it was gratified at the outcome.
   The Arab countries are concerned about the increasing flow of
Soviet Jewish refugees to Israel and the prospect that many would
be resettled in territory seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
   This would make it harder to fulfill the Arab goal of
establishing a Palestinian state in those areas.
   But Israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees
have been resettled in the West Bank or Gaza Strip or in East
Jerusalem.
   The State Department has generally sided with the Arab position
that Soviet Jews must not be settled in the occupied territories.
   Officials have said that a request for $400 million in U.S. aid
to house the Soviet emigres would be jeopardized if Soviet Jews are
resettled in these areas.
   The Bush administration has expressed opposition to all
settlement activities in the territories, but it has stopped short
of saying they are illegal.
   Israel felt that the United States, by trying to cooperate with
the Arab countries on the issue, was going along with what it
called an Arab effort to block the flow of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The settlement issue is one of several on which the United
States and Israel disagree, but the administration maintains that
it continues to view Israel as a close ally.

<HEAD>Baker Gifts Include Religious Picture From Soviet Counterpart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III received
a religious picture worth $175 as a gift last year from Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The gift was duly noted by Baker in his annual financial
disclosure form which also noted the receipt of a hunk of the
Berlin Wall, picture frames, photo albums, pottery, a handpainted
egg, a watercolor, a silver letter opener and books, all presents
from foreign officials.
   The picture, which was not further described, was presented to
Baker by Shevardnadze last September as the two met at Baker's
ranch near Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   The Baker gift list for 1989 also includes a leather hat valued
at $100 from Gareth Evans, foreign minister of Australia; a piece
of the Berlin Wall valued at $75 from Walter Momper, mayor of West
Berlin; a malachite horse valued at $150 from Sir David Wilson,
governor general of Hong Kong; and a mezuzah, a Jewish religious
object intended to be placed on the doorpost of one's home, from
Israeli prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The financial disclosure form, obtained Wednesday under the
Freedom of Information Act, shows that Baker kept a promise made
last February to sell his holdings in a New York bank and all his
other publicly traded stock.
   The move was prompted by questions from President Bush's ethics
chief about potential conflicts of interest.
   Announcing his decision in February 1990, Baker said it went
``well beyond'' what was required by law or had been recommended to
him by government lawyers.
   The controversy revolved primarily around Baker's holdings in
Chemical New York Corp., which had lent $4.5 billion to Third World
nations.
   Third World debt is an issue routinely faced by secretaries of
state.
   The disclosure form shows that on March 7, 1989 Baker sold 1,100
shares of Chemical New York preferred stock, valued for reporting
purposes at $15,000 to $50,000 and thousands of other types of
Chemical Corp. stock valued at a range of $26,000 to $75,000.
   Baker also sold hundreds of shares of the stock of other
companies, valued in all at a range of $35,000 to $120,000.
   The publicly traded companies included Exxon Corp., Houston
Industries Inc., Trinity Petroleum Trust, Commonwealth Edison,
Property Capital Trust, Salomon Inc., Schlumberger Inc., United
Technologies Corp., and Residential Resources Mortgage Investments
Corp.
   The disclosure form shows also that on Dec. 15, 1989 Baker
purchased 1,222 shares of a Merrill Lynch municipal bond fund
valued at a range of $5,000 to $15,000.
   Baker's stock holdings are in a qualified blind trust. A trustee
controls the stocks and tells Baker annually of the general nature
of the holdings.
   The current financial disclosure form, filed with the Office of
Government Ethics, and the one Baker filed last year, both put a
value of more than $250,000 on the assets held in the secretary's
qualified blind trust.
   Both forms show that the secretary received more than $100,000 a
year in income from the trust during the time covered, January
through August of 1988 and 1989.
   The 1989 disclosure places the value of the ranches Baker owns
in Texas and Wyoming at more than $250,000 each.

   The rivalry between Sonoma Valley and Napa
Valley, the nation's premier wine regions, took a theatrical turn
when caped crusaders in black masks ordered tourists on the Napa
Valley Wine Train to ``throw that Napa stuff out the window.''
   The tourists instead were served Sonoma Valley wine.
   The caped crusaders' antics Tuesday, which included a daring
leap off the moving train into the Robert Mondavi Winery, were
reported to the sheriff's office. But deputies decided against
making a federal case out of it.
   ``Throw that Napa stuff out the window and take some of this
Sonoma Valley wine,'' the raiders, revealing their true identity as
the Sonoma Valley Wine Patrol.
   At first, the travelers didn't know what to think, but soon
decided delight rather than fright was appropriate, especially when
they got to sip wines in the $10-$20 class for free.
   ``When I saw those black capes I thought they were some
religious cult,'' passenger Milli Minicelli of Oakland.
   Then she joined in the fun.
   The patrol's membership includes winemakers and others dedicated
to unfettered promotion of wine from Sonoma Valley. Over the years,
a hot competition has developed between the adjoining valleys.

   Max, the 2-year-old feline from Augusta
who received an invitation to a $1,500-a-plate political dinner,
may get to join the Republican fat cats in Washington after all.
   Radio station WBLM began soliciting contributions Wednesday to
buy Max a ticket to the June 12 dinner with President Bush. By
midday, the staion had received $400 in pledges.
   The station launched its ``Maxathon'' after receiving a call
from the cat's owner, Brian Woodbury, who was intrigued by the idea
of having Max dine with GOP muckety-mucks.
   Liz Hamel of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
which coordinates the annual dinner, said earlier this week that
invitations are sent to GOP contributors.
   ``Either Mr. Woodbury's cat is on a mailing list, or somebody's
playing a joke,'' Ms. Hamel said.
   ``If Max wants to attend, he can,'' she said, provided he comes
up with the $1,500.
   Woodbury and his wife, Jennifer, said they had no idea why their
feline was invited to the dinner, especially since they are
Democrats who have never contributed to a political party.
   Woodbury said he had decided to let the matter drop but changed
his mind Tuesday and called the rock station to suggest a fund
drive.
   ``I know they do some really wild stuff,'' said Woodbury, a
24-year-old accounting student and part-time employee of Central
Maine Power Co.
   Captain Herb Ivy, the WBLM morning disc jockey, said
contributors who send in $5 or more would receive pictures of
Barbara Bush in a bathing suit.
   ``If we don't raise all of the $1,500, we'll probably give the
money to the humane society,'' Ivy said.

   Ginger is in the dog house with the
police department these days.
   That's because the Lhasa apso twice managed to place 911
emergency calls from an Arlington house on Wednesday. At least,
police can think of no other explanation for the calls.
   Police said they found the dog beside a telephone when they
entered the place after receiving the second call. No one else was
home.
   Ginger's owner, Jane Shumaker, said she hadn't programmed 911
into her telephone's automatic dialing system, and she finds it
hard to believe her pet made the call.
   But she added, ``I'm beginning to think she's smarter than I
thought. Maybe she was lonesome.''

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Propose 1 Percent Boost in Some Target Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic majority on the Senate
Agriculture Committee is proposing a 1 percent increase in target
prices for wheat, feed grains and cotton.
   The proposal by the 10 Democrats was placed before the nine
Republicans on the committee Wednesday and could come up for a vote
by next week, staff aiders said.
   The price support program would cost about $10.6 billion a year
and is higher than the Bush administration is seeking.
   The proposal would increase the target prices in fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, and maintain the increase for the other four
years of the five-year farm bill.
   A rise in the consumer price index would automatically trigger
additional target price increases, but the agriculture secretary
would have the option of then reducing the increase by four
percentage points.
   In an effort to dramatize the need for government involvement in
agriculture, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., sent bags of groceries to
the other members of the Senate on Wednesday.
   ``This bag of groceries would cost you about $14.41 at a grocery
store,'' he said in an enclosed note. ``Just $1.40 of that will
find its way back to the farmer.''
   He said a loaf of bread contains 7 cents worth of wheat, a
chocolate bar 1 cent worth of sugar, soft drinks just 2 cents worth
of corn sweetener.
   ``Over the past 10 years, we've seen a steady disinvestment in
agriculture,'' he said. ``Net farm income has plummeted. ... Unless
we restore some income security to agriculture, there will be very
few farmers to raise the crops of the new century, and very few
people in rural America to support American agriculture.''

   ``Our study shows that the food stamp program is failing to

it does not consider the high costs faced by shoppers in poor rural
America,'' said Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food &amp; Health Policy.
   The organization surveyed 33 rural counties last summer that
were considered representative of the 269 persistently poor rural
counties nationwide.
   They found:
   _Nearly one-third of the food stamps were redeemed at smaller
stores where prices were higher.
   _In three out of four supermarkets the food that the government
expects a family of four to buy for $75 cost on average $81.
   _Limited availability of fresh fruit, vegetables and meats in
the stores that redeemed food stamps.
   _Only 30 percent of the competitively priced supermarkets are
located in rural areas.
   The House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday approved a section of
the farm bill on food stamps that attempts to respond to problems
facing the rural poor.

   Imported fruits and vegetables are likely to
be contaminated by illegal pesticides, according to data from the
Food and Drug Administration.
   The information was released Wednesday by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, before the
upcoming vote on his bill to ban U.S. companies from selling
chemicals abroad are kept off the market here for health reasons.
   Overall, 5 percent of the imported produce examined by FDA
inspectors during the last two years was found to contain residue
from pesticides that are not allowed to be sold to farmers in the
United States.
   The contamination rate may be even higher, because the FDA does
not screen for all the possible pesticides that are used in foreign
countries, said Leahy.
   ``Although FDA is responsible for inspecting almost all imported
food, it only samples a minuscule 1 percent to 2 percent of the
food entering this country,'' said Leahy. ``The rest is simply
waived through at the wharf.''
   About 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables eaten by Americans
come from other countries. Data on domestically grown produce
showed little or no pesticides residues.
   Here is the extent by percentage to which 12 tested fruits and
vegetables were found to be contaminated, based on inspections
between Oct. 1, 1988 and April 13, 1990:
   Peas, 10.3.
   Eggplant 9.4.
   Cabbage 8.9.
   Pears, 8.
   Peppers, 7.4.
   Squash, 4.5.
   Carrots, 2.3.
   Broccoli, 1.7.
   Tangerines, 7.1.
   Okra, 7.2.
   Blackberries, 8.9.
   Papayas, 4.1.

<HEAD>Bill to Improve Nutrition Information Moving Through Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers would have more uniform and accurate
nutrition information on the food they buy under legislation making
progress in Congress.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday approved a
labeling bill similar to a measure adopted last month by the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee. The House and Senate floors
are the respective next steps for each.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the primary author of the House
legislation, said it is intended to ``make sense of the confusing
array of nutritional labels that now confront consumers each time
they enter the supermarket.''
   Through uniform standards to be developed by the Food and Drug
Administration, the legislation also would regulate health and
nutrition claims such as ``light,'' ``low'' or ``lean'' on packages
and assertions of their role in preventing cancer or heart disease.
   Current labeling practices have ``turned the grocery store aisle
into a veritable minefield of false and misleading claims,'' said
Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
a consumer activist group.
   The legislation would pre-empt state food labeling laws on
nutrition but not food safety, such has health warnings, or
consumer economic issues, such as freshness dating or unit pricing.
Meat, poultry and egg products are specifically exempted.
   Labels on processed foods and posted signs and brochures for
fresh produce and fish would be required to uniformly specify the
amount of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total
carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber and
total protein for each serving.
   The bill was sent to the full House on a voice vote after the
Energy and Commerce Committee's chairman, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., rejected industry-led efforts to pre-empt state laws
requiring labels to also contain warnings about chemical
contaminants and carcinogens.
   Also rejected by a 24-19 vote was an amendment to exempt fresh
fruit, vegetables and fish from the nutrition reporting
requirements entirely.
   Supporters of the amendment said extending the requirements
beyond processed and pre-packaged foods puts too much of a burden
on grocery stores and is unneeded since most consumers already are
aware of the nutritional value of fresh fruits, vegetables and fish.
   ``If any yuppies in America want to know how much fat is in an
avocado, they can find that out by going through journals in a
library,'' said Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, D-La.
   But proponents of the requirement said it would be nonsensical
to exempt the very kinds of foods that people are most likely to
eat if they are diet-conscious.
   The pre-emption issue has divided both the Congress and the Bush
administration.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, for example,
has sided against the food industry in directing that new labeling
requirements being developed by the FDA should not pre-empt tougher
state laws.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who has jurisdiction over
label requirements on meat, poultry and egg products, has taken the
opposite tack. He says state-by-state labeling only drives costs up
for consumers and sets a bad example for international trade.
   Dingell refused Wednesday to allow votes on extending the
federal pre-emption over state laws to potentially hazardous food
ingredients, ruling they were not germane to the nutrition issue.
   Sought by 16 food industry trade associations, the amendments
were focused particularly at pre-empting a California law that
requires food labels to list any possible cancer-causing
ingredients.

<HEAD>Builders Say They're Being Cut Off From Credit Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home builders and some congressmen are
mounting a campaign against a ``credit crunch'' they say is
crippling the construction industry and threatening the loss of
200,000 jobs.
   Coinciding with a Commerce Department report Wednesday about the
smallest number of housing starts since the last recession, the
National Association of Home Builders called a news conference to
announce the details of their latest industry survey.
   Association President Martin Perlman said the survey showed that
``builders are being indiscriminately cut off from the credit
markets. Production is dropping. People are losing their jobs and
businesses. The disruptions in the housing delivery system are far
more severe than anyone anticipated.''
   The Commerce report said housing starts had dropped 5.8 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million units, the
lowest level since 1.17 million units were started at an annual
rate in October 1982.
   At issue, the home builders said, is the new savings and loan
bailout law that limits the amount of loans to an individual and
tightens requirements for loans by commercial banks.
   However, other housing industry observers say steep mortgage
rates, overbuilding and the high cost of new homes also contribute
to the downturn in construction.
   The S&amp;L reform law limits to 15 percent the amount of capital
that a thrift institution can lend to one borrower. Before the law
was enacted last August, thrifts could lend as much as 100 percent
of their funds to a single builder.
   Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., told the news conference that 68
congressmen have joined him in sponsoring a bill that would remedy
the problem by permitting a transition period during which builders
could find alternative sources of construction funds.
   Hoagland said he believes the bill will reach the House floor
within two weeks. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate
by Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala.
   ``Further complicating the situation is the fact that commercial
banks have not been able to pick up the slack and are tightening
their lending requirements due to a February bulletin from the
Comptroller of the Currency warning commercial banks about the
dangers of real estate lending and urging bank examiners to look
closely at all of the real estate loans in the banks under their
jurisdiction,'' Perlman said.
   ``This is having an inhibiting effect on housing finance that is
clearly reflected in our survey results,'' he added. He welcomed a
statement last week by bank regulators saying that banks should
keep making loans to qualified customers.
   ``Hopefully that message will get out to the bank examiners,''
Perlman said.
   Meanwhile, he said, the credit crunch has caused the builders
group to revise its 1990 housing starts forecast downward from 1.42
million units to 1.28 million.
   ``This decrease of 140,000 housing starts translates into the
loss of 200,000 jobs for an entire year, $6 billion in wages and $2
billion in taxes at all levels,'' Perlman said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders are moving their efforts to
find a compromise on campaign finance reform behind closed doors
after staking out widely divergent party opening positions in
public.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Republican leader
Bob Dole of Kansas on Wednesday each named five senators from their
parties to begin what is expected to be long and arduous weeks of
negotiations.
   ``I remain optimistic, but no one should expect any miracles,''
Dole said. ``Obviously, there are many different points of view and
many areas of disagreement.''
   Dole appointed Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, one of the most
vehement opponents of campaign spending ceilings that are the key
feature of the Democratic bill, to head the Republican team.
   Other members include Sens. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., and Don Nickles, R-Okla., with Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
the ranking Republican on the Senate Rules Committee, serving as an
adviser.
   Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, the primary author of the
Democratic measure, was named to head his party's team. Other
members are Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., John Breaux, D-La., and
Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.
   Mitchell said he and Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the
Senate Rules Committee, will ``monitor and guide'' the discussions
from the Democratic side.
   ``None of us have any illusions about the difficulty of this
process,'' Mitchell said. ``Democrats and Republicans have tended
to see this issue from vastly different perspectives.''
   Mitchell and Dole last week brought widely contrasting bills to
the Senate floor on behalf of their parties last week. Each, in the
name of reform, basically seeks to rein in the current advantages
held by the other party.
   Democrats would establish voluntary ceilings on how much
candidates can spend equal to about two-thirds of what was spent on
the last election and outlaw contributions by political action
committees directly to candidates.
   Compliance would be encouraged through a public finance scheme
in which voluntary contribution of up to $3 a year through income
tax returns would pick up about half of a candidate's combined
primary and general election campaign costs.
   Republicans are calling for a total abolition of PACs and are
seeking to sharply curtail Democrats' historic reliance upon labor
unions for grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts.
   Both parties claim their bills plug current loopholes of the
type that allowed savings and loan entrepreneur Charles H. Keating
Jr. to pour $1.3 million into the election campaigns of five
senators now under investigation for alleged ethical misconduct.

<HEAD>Senator Meets With Ethics Panel on Accusations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., held his
first private talks with the Senate Ethics Committee since the
panel found ``substantial credible evidence'' that he violated
federal law and Senate rules.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., committee vice chairman, told
reporters that Wednesday's meeting with Durenburger did not resolve
the case, which is set for hearings beginning June 12.
   Any meetings before the trial-like hearings could be
significant, because Durenberger said earlier this month that he
believed the committee was pushing him to negotiate a settlement of
the case.
   Durenberger's spokeswoman, Lois West, confirmed this was the
first time the senator had met with the panel since it filed
allegations of wrongdoing involving his financial dealings. But she
would not comment on the substance of the talks.
   When the committee scheduled the hearings, Durenberger said,
``It's a matter of wanting to bring this to a head. Whether the
hearing is going to be necessary, we'll have to wait until early
June to make a decision.''
   Those comments were made before the committee significantly
expanded the allegations last week, making Durenberger's defense
more difficult.
   Last week, the panel found ``substantial credible evidence'' of
financial wrongdoing, misrepresentations to the Senate and improper
administration of Durenberger's blind trust.
   Those allegations, covering August 1983 to November 1989, all
are related to transactions involving a Minneapolis condominium
that Durenberger partly owned while collecting Senate
reimbursements for his stays there. He has been a senator since
November 1978.
   Last week's announcement also said the ethics committee had
found ``substantial cause'' to conclude that Durenberger had
``misused United States Senate funds through a pattern of improper
conduct which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate.''
   In February, the committee found ``substantial credible
evidence'' that the law and Senate rules were violated on two other
matters: a book deal under which Durenberger made speeches and
accepted fees to promote two books he wrote; and his acceptance of
free limousine service for personal trips in the Boston area. These
allegations covered events in 1985-86.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Aide Won't be Disciplined in News Leak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr supports
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision not to discipline his
chief spokesman for confirming the existence of a criminal
investigation involving a congressman.
   But Starr, who had been asked to review the matter by
Thornburgh, said in a statement Wednesday night that he identified
certain ``concerns of an administrative nature'' that prompted the
attorney general to make procedural changes.
   Starr reviewed the issue after Thornburgh confirmed that his
chief spokesman, David Runkel, had been a ``secondary source'' of
the story that the FBI was investigating financial irregularities
in the office of Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   Runkel and Thornburgh's chief of staff, Robert S. Ross Jr., who
were both questioned and given lie-detector tests during an
investigation of the leak, were reassigned to other duties Monday
in a move officials said was unrelated to the Gray case.
   Both men showed evidence of deception during polygraph tests,
said sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the sources
stressed that the evidence of deception occurred during responses
to tangential questions.
   The investigation determined that Ross was not a source of the
information contained in the CBS story, officials said.
   The Gray story was aired last spring while the congressman was
running for House majority whip. It proved politically embarrassing
for Thornburgh, who has made plugging unauthorized news leaks a
hallmark of his stormy tenure at the Justice Department.
   Democratic lawmakers charged the leak was politically inspired.
The Justice Department then took the unusual step of issuing a
statement that Gray was not a target of the investigation.
   Thornburgh also ordered the massive leak investigation, which
subsequently failed to identify the original source of the
information.
   In his statement, Starr said he concurred with the earlier
finding that there was ``no basis for criminal prosecution''
involving the leak.
   Starr agreed that ``there is no evidence'' that any official in
the Justice Department's headquarters or the U.S. attorney's office
in Philadelphia ``was the source of the original unauthorized
disclosure.''
   Runkel and Ross were reassigned to other duties Monday in an
attempt by Thornburgh to correct the public image that he runs the
Justice Department through a tight circle of politically loyal
aides.
   Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said Starr's findings were
``totally unrelated to the personnel changes that took place this
week.''
   He declined to describe the procedural changes that Thornburgh
ordered to correct the administrative concerns identified by Starr.
   Starr said he didn't recommend ``that any disciplinary action be
taken against any Department of Justice official'' and concluded
``it was appropriately within the discretion of the attorney
general to determine that no disciplinary action ... is warranted.''
   Starr said he concluded that ``the matter may be appropriately
closed.''
   Thornburgh last month had defended Runkel's handling of the
episode, saying the spokesman was following standing orders not to
mislead reporters.
   Thornburgh had said Runkel did not steer CBS reporter Rita
Braver off information that she had obtained from other sources.
   Starr noted several of the 10 people who were given lie-detector
tests ``experienced difficulties on some aspects of their polygraph
examinations,'' although he said there was no evidence the original
leak came from the Justice headquarters or U.S. attorney's office
in Philadelphia.
   Runkel, who had been accused by reporters of giving them
misleading and incorrect information on numerous occasions, was
appointed communications director and will no longer act as the
department's spokesman.
   A search for a new director of the Office of Public Affairs is
under way.
   Ross, who is planning to return to private law practice in two
or three months, was assigned to organize a new office of
international operations.

   Mayor Marion Barry's lawyer is seeking
dismissal of the half dozen new drug and conspiracy charges against
his client.
   R. Kenneth Mundy filed the motion for dismissal Wednesday after
Barry pleaded innocent a day earlier to six additional charges
brought against him.
   Mundy complained that the new charges would not allow the
mayor's defense team to prepare adequately for the trial scheduled
to begin in U.S. District Court in Washington on June 4.
   The lawyer maintains that the six new charges are ``vindictive
and an undue burden'' because they were brought just three weeks
before the trial date.
   The new charges accuse Barry of five misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy. The
mayor took drugs as far back as 1984, the new indictment alleges.
   Barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought Feb.
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and that he
possessed cocaine on five occasions.

   Dominicans crowded
polling stations Wednesday to pick a president in an election
pitting conservative incumbent Joaquin Balaguer, who is 83 and
blind, against an 80-year-old Marxist rival.
   Leftist former President Juan Bosch took an early lead in
initial, sketchy returns.
   With only 324 of the 6,663, or 5 percent, of the polling
stations reporting, Bosch had 24,907 votes to Balaguer's 20,967,
the Electoral Board said. About 3.2 million people were registered
to vote.
   The board announced the first results on television at 1:15 a.m.
Thursday, more than one hour behind schedule. Board president
Froilan Tavares apologized for the delay but gave no explanation.
   Earlier, Tavares said there were some insignificant voting
irregularities. But he said they were not serious enough to affect
the outcome.
   Both Bosch and Balaguer, a five-time president, said they were
confident of victory in their fifth matchup to lead this Caribbean
nation of 7 million people.
   ``I will accept the voting results whatever they may be,'' said
Balaguer, who was blinded by glaucoma, after casting his vote.
``But I trust Dominicans will ... re-elect me for another four
years.''
   Bosch, voting earlier at the same polling station in the capital
of Santo Domingo, said: ``I am not optimistic or pessimistic. I am
realistic because everyone knows we won this election a long time
ago.''
   The turnout appeared heavy in the normally bustling capital,
which ground to a virtual standstill. Lines formed for blocks at
some polling stations.
   Soldiers stood on street corners, but no disturbances were
reported. Most shops and offices were closed in the city of 2
million. Alcohol sales were banned for the day.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, accompanied by his wife Rosalynn,
joined about 30 international observers monitoring the vote to
ensure against ballot fraud.
   Police said at least six people were injured outside the capital
Monday night in clashes between opposing political supporters.
   Bosch, leader of the Dominican Liberation Party, describes
himself as a Marxist _ but not a Communist. He has moderated his
stands in recent years, and during this campaign pledged to work
for good relations with the United States and to promote capitalism.
   He has written more than 40 books, novels, short stories, poems
and Latin American and Caribbean histories. He was nominated last
year for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
   Bosch's party has been claiming Balaguer organizers prepared
300,000 phony ballots to rig the vote, a charge denied by
Balaguer's party.
   Balaguer, leader of the Social Christian Reformist Party, pinned
his hopes largely on a $2 billion public-works project to transform
centuries-old Santo Domingo. The project was planned in part to
coincide with 1992 celebrations of the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' arrival in the New World.
   The president, a lawyer and himself the author of more than 20
books, ran under the slogan, ``Balaguer, a road without danger.''
He portrayed Bosch as a dangerous Marxist.
   Balaguer's public-works project has created thousands of new
jobs, but his popularity has slumped as the country's economic
problems deepened. Dominicans have contended with chronic
electricity blackouts and water shortages.
   Bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points the past
year. But some observers believe he may be hurt by his criticism
last week of a 1954 agreement with the Vatican providing all army
chaplains be Roman Catholic. This nation, which shares the island
of Hispaniola with Haiti, is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   In 1963, Bosch became the country's first democratically elected
president after the assassination of dictator Gen. Rafael Trujillo
two years earlier. Only seven months into office, he was ousted in
a military coup.
   An attempt by rebel soldiers to restore Bosch to the presidency
led to civil war in 1965 and prompted President Lyndon Johnson to
send in 23,000 U.S. Marines to prevent a leftist takeover.
   Balaguer rose to power under the 31-year Trujillo dictatorship,
serving briefly as the general's figurehead president. He was first
elected president in his own right in 1966 and served three
consecutive four-year terms before losing in 1978. He returned to
power in 1986.
   Other candidates for president were Jose Francisco Pena Gomez,
52, a former mayor of Santo Domingo and civil war hero who leads
the socialist Dominican Revolutionary Party; and Jacobo Majluta,
55, leader of the center-left Independent Revolutionary Party.
   Voters also chose a vice president, 30 senators, 120
congressional deputies and more than 100 mayors.

   Officials are violating the human rights of illegal
foreign workers by threatening them with prison and fines under a
law taking effect June 1, a Pakistani worker says.
   ``They treat us like jungle animals,'' Shahab Ammed, one of an
estimated 100,000 undocumented foreign workers in Japan, told a
news conference Wednesday. ``We are bound here _ like we are living
in a zoo.''
   Ammed, wearing dark glasses, spoke in halting English to about
100 reporters with the Rev. Hidetoshi Watanabe, who is chairman of
an association that helps foreign workers.
   Watanabe, a United Church of Christ minister, said the Justice
Ministry's immigration bureau is deliberately misleading illegal
workers by implying they face up to three years in prison or fines
of about $13,000 under the new immigration law.
   In fact, he said, the new law applies only to employers and
brokers who hire illegal workers after June 1.
   ``My guess is they are trying to scare all the undocumented
workers out of the country,'' Watanabe said.
   Thousands of illegal workers are rushing to turn themselves in
and be deported before the law takes effect, officials say.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Takashi Nakamura said he had heard no
reports of harassment of foreign workers. He said punishment under
the new law applies only to employers or brokers but the workers
themselves may be jailed, fined or deported as under the current
law.
   In 1989, 16,608 people were convicted of working illegally in
Japan, the ministry says. But few workers have been punished,
Watanabe said.
   Unlike many developed countries, Japan does not allow foreigners
to come in as unskilled laborers. But thousands of foreigners enter
on tourist or student visas, then stay on to work in low-paying
factory or construction jobs after their visas expire.
   Women from the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand work
illegally in Japan's massive sex industry, and many Americans
without the proper documentation are teaching English. Although the
number of illegal workers is officially estimated at 108,000, the
number may be as high as 300,000, Watanabe said.
   Ammed said he earns about $1,777 a month doing clerical work for
a plastics company. He said unskilled foreign workers generally
earn about $4.60 an hour and many work 12 hours a day.
   Many Japanese companies would fail without the illegal foreign
labor, he said.
   ``The new generation in Japan has no interest in this low and
hard work,'' said Ammed. He suggested that since Japan needs the
workers, it should pardon them and establish procedures for
admitting more, as other industrialized countries have done.
   But the problem is compounded by Japan's wariness of foreigners,
especially those with darker skin. Ammed said that even when he was
in Japan legally, he was hounded by police angrily demanding to see
his passport and accusing him of lying.
   Ammed gave Watanabe a letter signed by 190 illegal workers
appealing for an immigration law that would help foreign workers.
Watanabe said he would present it Friday to the Justice Ministry.
   Ammed said he faced the risk of arrest by coming forward but was
willing to sacrifice himself to improve the lot of illegal workers.
   ``We will fight in favor of human rights until we die,'' he
said. ``If the police arrest me, a second will come. They can't
arrest us all.''

   Hollywood's stars shed tears for Sammy Davis
Jr., the exuberant song-and-dance man who started as a vaudevillian
in white face and battled to the glittery top of the entertainment
world.
   The man who joked he was the nation's only ``black, one-eyed,
Jewish entertainer'' died early Wednesday of throat cancer at age
64.
   ``A heaven with his magic gives me warmth,'' said Frank Sinatra.
``Sam was the best friend a man could have. He was a class act and
I will miss him forever.''
   Davis died at his Beverly Hills home, his wife, Altovise, and
three of his four children at his side. He was diagnosed with
throat cancer eight months ago and had returned home from the
hospital March 13 after a two-month stay.
   Davis _ actor, singer, dancer and impressionist _ performed on
stage, on television and in the movies, a powerhouse packed into a
bantam, 5-foot-6 frame.
   His gold chains, heavy rings and gaudy bracelets were as much a
part of his personality as his chain smoking, his self-mocking hip
patter of ``peace'' and ``love'' and his membership in Hollywood's
Rat Pack along with Sinatra and others.
   His hit songs included ``Something's Gotta Give'' (1955), ``I've
Gotta Be Me'' (1969) and ``The Candy Man'' (1972). His films
included ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``Oceans 11'' ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
   Davis began as a tap-dancing toddler in Harlem. In the
vaudeville days, he danced bug-eyed with white paint on his face
because that's what white producers wanted. Decades later, he
couldn't gamble or rent a room in some of the Las Vegas hotels at
which he played.
   In the 1960s, after he had made it, some black activists derided
him as a sell-out. Others considered him a gilded Las Vegas drone.
But he had millions of fans and was admired as an entertainer's
entertainer.
   ``I would say that Sammy Davis Jr. was the greatest entertainer
in show business,'' George Burns said. ``There wasn't anything
Sammy Davis couldn't do.''
   ``He was the entertainer we all strived to live up to,'' said
Liza Minnelli, who toured with Davis and Sinatra last year. ``I
never saw anyone give so much.''
   Sinatra canceled the remainder of a weeklong concert series at
Radio City Music Hall after learning of Davis' death.
   Davis' energetic performances and upbeat manner were therapy for
a life scarred by bigotry, failed marriages, drug and alcohol abuse
and crippling tax problems.
   He wrote two autobiographies, ``Yes, I Can'' in 1965, and ``Why
Me?'' in 1989. In the latter, he described his all-night partying,
endless drug use and womanizing _ the hallmark of the 1960s Rat
Pack, which also included Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, Dean Martin,
and Shirley MacLaine.
   But friends said they remembered Davis for his warmth and
generosity.
   ``As great an entertainer as Sammy was, he was an even greater
friend, not only to me, but to anyone whose life he touched,'' said
Martin.
   Jerry Lewis wept as he spoke about Davis. ``I lost a brother,''
Lewis said. ``The whole world is a lot less now than when we had
him.''
   Davis was active in many charitable causes, often appearing on
Lewis' telethons for muscular dystrophy. His death brought tributes
from former President Reagan and civil rights leader Benjamin L.
Hooks.
   ``The world has lost not only an irreplaceable talent, but a
humanitarian whose heart was so big, so filled with caring for
others,'' said Hooks, executive director of the NAACP.
   Davis was born Dec. 8, 1925, the son of dancer Sammy Davis and
chorus girl Elvera Sanchez Davis. When he was 4, his father and
``adopted uncle'' Will Mastin passed him off as a 44-year-old
midget.
   Trained in tap dance by the legendary Bill ``Bojangles''
Robinson, Davis went on the vaudeville circuit and criss-crossed
the country 23 times by age 15.
   ``From the time I can remember, I've been around grease paint,''
Davis once said. ``While other kids my age were playing with
marbles and toys, I knew only about the backstage dressing rooms.''
   When he was 18, Davis joined the Army and experienced prejudice
that he would say gave him something to prove. His nose was broken
in a fight with a white soldier. Others painted him white, to
remind him that he wasn't.
   A triumphant first engagement in Hollywood in 1951 led to a
signing by Decca Records. His first Broadway show, ``Mr.
Wonderful,'' opened in 1955 and ran for 383 performances.
   By the 1960s, Davis had established himself as one of the most
popular and richly compensated entertainers in the world. But
emotional troubles continued to plague him until recent years.
   He married dancer Loray White in 1958; they divorced a year
later. He wed Swedish actress Mai Britt in 1961, and they had a
daughter and adopted two sons. They were divorced in 1968. He
married Altovise Gore, a dancer in his nightclub act, in 1970, and
they adopted a son.
   A funeral is planned for Friday at the 1,200-seat Hall of
Liberty in the Hollywood Hills.

<HEAD>Tunisia Says `No, Thanks' to Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when most Third World countries are
clamoring for new money, Tunisia's government has said it does not
want $92 million of a $275 million loan, the International Monetary
Fund announced.
   Fund officials said on Wednesday they could not recall that
happening before. The fund, which is owned by 152 governments,
gives its loans on strict conditions and borrowing countries have
been glad to take all they can get.
   President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been visiting President
Bush and others in Washington.
   Seven months after he took power in a bloodless coup at the end
of 1987, the fund offered him the loan, to be disbursed over three
years. Tunisia has never drawn any of the money.
   Now the fund says Tunisia had asked for a ``reduction of
access'' that would drop the total to $183 million. A fund official
said that meant the Tunisian government would use some of the
money, but not all.
   It already owes the fund $223 million. The country's total
foreign debt reached $6.7 billion at the end of 1988, according to
the World Bank.
   A senior administration official said Tunisia had one of the
world's best records on debt repayment.

   A California toy company is recalling 262 baby
rattles with small parts it says could choke or cut young children.
   Small World Toys recalled its yellow plastic Spinflower Rattles
because the toy may break apart when dropped, ``releasing small
beads,'' the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday in
announcing the recall. In addition, the federal agency said, the
rattle's ``flower petals may also break off producing sharp
points.''
   The rattles, sold nationwide since January 1988, was packaged in
a clear plastic carrying case with a label marked ``Fischerform.''
   Both the commission and company said there had been no reports
of injuries involving the product. Consumer may return the rattles
to the store where purchased for a refund.

<HEAD>Missourian Proposes Overhaul of National Arts Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo., is proposing to
revamp the National Endowment of Arts to give state arts groups a
majority share of the agency's monies.
   Coleman and Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis. unveiled the proposal
Wednesday, saying it has the backing of the House GOP leadership.
   In a statement, Coleman said the proposal was designed to
``revitalize, restructure and redirect the focus'' of the
endowment. The agency has come under sharp attack on Capitol Hill
because of grants of federal money to support what critics say are
obscene art exhibits.
   The proposal by Coleman would increase from 20 percent to 60
percent the amount of endowment monies that must go directly to
state arts councils.
   ``Our proposal will demand accountability, by the endowment and
those who receive grants through it, to taxpayers whose monies
support NEA,'' Coleman said. ``Specifically, it is designed to
ensure that the creative works, exhibitions and performances
supported by NEA funding meet community obscenity standards.''

   Three retirees who set out on the Huck
Finn adventure they missed in their youth got a little more than
they bargained for on a nine-day trip. They found out why it's
called the mighty Mississippi.
   ``It's not a trip for the faint of heart,'' said Irving Glazer,
70, who took on 900 miles of the Mississippi River with Alvin
Levenson, 67, and Stanley Herman, 66, all of Indianapolis.
   The three set out from Cairo, Ill., aboard not a raft but a
24-foot pontoon boat, The Silver Fox. They ended up at Baton Rouge,
La., weary from struggling against currents, sandbars and the giant
workboats that ply the river.
   They had intended to continue on to New Orleans but took a look
at the seagoing vessels docked at Baton Rouge and decided to finish
the trip by car.
   In Mark Twain's 1884 novel, Huckleberry Finn and Jim jump off
their raft just before it is run over by a paddlewheel steamer. The
only steamboats the Indianapolis three saw were of the tourist
variety, but they got their fill of barges.
   Mississippi barges carry up to 1,500 tons each, and the lower
river is their workyard. That, with the logs and other debris in
the water, made for tough maneuvering for the modern-day Huck Finns.
   ``It was like riding a bicycle on an interstate,'' Levenson said.
   The trip got off to a rough, wet start when the Fox left Cairo,
at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, on May 2,
fighting heavy head winds and pounding waves.
   ``None of us dreamed we would hit four-foot waves on a river,
but we did,'' Levenson said.
   The second day out, the travelers ran into a sandbar between
Hickman, Ky., and Memphis and radioed the Coast Guard for help. A
rescue squad from Reelfoot Lake, Tenn., freed the boat and cleaned
the sand out of its 60-horsepower outboard.
   ``They said they really appreciated us calling them because it
was the first rescue they'd had this year,'' said Levenson.
   The Indianapolis three were retired businessmen expecting a
leisurely trip. But they got little use out of the lawn chairs and
battery-operated TV they had packed. The river current changed
often and the water was full of debris.
   ``We had to keep a spotter up front the whole trip,'' Levenson
said.
   The three spent four nights on the boat but found overnight
accommodations ashore the rest of the time.
   Unlike Huck Finn, they never stumbled into a bloody feud between
two families and never got mixed up in a con game. No one nearly
drowned. Still, they found some of the same scenery Twain described
in the 19th century.
   Levenson said it was lonely amid the thick woods lining the
riverbanks.
   ``There wasn't a living soul for miles. There is nothing along
that bank, no telephone poles or any sign of life,'' Levenson said.
``When we got to Memphis there were a few pleasure boats. Outside
of that, there wasn't another pleasure boat on the whole trip.''
   Below Memphis, the travelers hung up on another sandbar and this
time no help was around.
   ``We took off our clothes and got into the water. There we were,
three old guys in the Mississippi River pushing and pushing until
we got back into the deep water,'' Levenson said.
   While the trip was rougher than expected, Glazer said he's ready
to do it again.
   ``It's the most exciting thing I think I've ever done,'' he
said. ``It was a challenge and there was an element of danger.''

<HEAD>Henson's Death Means `A Lot Less Sunshine in the World'</HEAD>

   The death of Jim Henson, whose warm and fuzzy
Muppets like Kermit the Frog taught and delighted millions
worldwide, shocked those who appreciated his art, but they said
they're glad his work will live on.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera singer
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death at age 53 Wednesday of
complications from pneumonia.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. Kermit and some of his pals
made their debut on a Washington TV program, ``Sam and Friends,''
which won an Emmy in 1959. During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe
appeared regularly on ``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.''
   But the Muppets' popularity exploded into a worldwide phenomenon
after they began appearing on ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman and chief executive officer
of Children's Television Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend. Fortunately for the children of the world, Jim
Henson's work will live on.''
   Opera singer Placido Domingo, actor Danny DeVito and singer Lena
Horne were among the real-life stars who performed with the Muppets.
   Miss Horne said Henson was absent Tuesday from a gathering of
the ``Sesame Street'' cast and friends. But she had no idea he was
near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' said Miss Horne.
   In 1976, Henson introduced ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred
the Mae West-style femme fatale Miss Piggy. The show won three
Emmys during its five-year run and became the most widely seen TV
program in the world. Some 235 million viewers in 100 countries
watched it.
   The Muppets, in dark and macabre form, also appeared in the
first year of ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1975.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' in 1981 and
``The Muppets Take Manhattan'' in 1984.
   His magic touch was evident again this year with his work on the
box-office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Henson, a rumpled figure with shaggy hair and a beard, said the
word ``muppet'' was something he just made up, although to appease
interviewers he would say it was a combination of ``marionette''
and ``puppet.'' Besides Kermit, he did the voices of Ernie and
game-show host Guy Smiley.
   ``Puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon
characters have,'' Henson said in 1986. ``I'm sure Kermit will stay
younger a lot longer than I will.''
   Henson's death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street'' in the
past year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the popular
children's series, died last year at age 52. Former cast member
Northern Calloway also died recently.
   A ``Sesame Street'' spokeswoman said it was too soon to say how
Henson's passing would affect the show.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at New York Hospital,
was asked by a reporter if Henson had AIDS. He said: ``He had
pneumonia, definitely, absolutely, no AIDS.''
   Henson had been admitted to the hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' untreated for at least three days, Gelmont
said.
   Asked why Henson failed to seek more aggressive treatment for
his illness, Jim Henson Productions spokeswoman Susan Berry said:
``My guess is he's totally absorbed. He couldn't be bothered. He
was very cavalier with his health.''
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., in 1936. He married in
1959 and with his wife, Jane, had five children. They range in age
from 19 to 30.
   He directed the fantasy films ``The Dark Crystal'' in 1982 and
``Labyrinth'' in 1986.
   Henson won a Peabody award for excellence in TV programming, a
Grammy for a Muppet album, and four consecutive Emmys for
outstanding animation for his Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended marginally higher against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rebounded moderately.
   The dollar closed at 152.00 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
close at 151.95 yen. The currency opened at 152.08 yen and ranged
between 151.73 yen and 152.55 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average recouped 93.98 points, or
0.29 percent, ending at 32,061.60. It lost 29.42 points the
previous day.
   Stocks opened mixed because of the yen's early slip but the
Nikkei rose as market players started picking up issues of
well-performing companies, said Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with
Nomura Securities Co.
   ``The yen's lower opening did not discourage market players
much, mainly because they think the currency's recent uptrend is
not over yet,'' he said.
   Currency dealers said foreign securities firms and Japanese
institutions such as life insurance firms bought the dollar for
position adjustments after the currency's recent decline, while
investment trust companies bought the yen.
   A dealer with a major Japanese commercial bank said the dollar
is likely to fluctuate narrowly as many market players wait for the
announcement later Thursday of the U.S. March trade figures.
   The price of benchmark No.119 10-year Japanese government bond
fell to 87.80 from Wednesday's close of 87.90. That boosted the
yield to 7.00 percent from 6.98 percent.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf pvs, `Previously, it ...' to CLARIFY earlier

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A widely used spermicide hailed for its
ability to prevent AIDS and venereal disease can cause bladder and
yeast infections in women, some of whom should consider another
method of birth control, scientists say.
   The spermicide, nonoxynol-9, is the active ingredient in most
contraceptive foams, jellies and creams. Some condoms are packaged
with the spermicide.
   The research provides the first evidence that nonoxynol-9 can
trigger the uncomfortable urinary and vaginal infections even when
the spermicide is used without a diaphragm, vaginal sponge or
condom, said Dr. Thomas Hooton, who conducted two studies at the
University of Washington in Seattle.
   Earlier studies suggested that diaphragms and sponges cause the
infections. Spermicides had not been previously studied separately.
   Nonoxynol-9 has been hailed in recent years for its ability to
prevent the spread of diseases such as AIDS.
   ``Nonoxynol-9 is an extremely effective agent against many
sexually transmitted diseases, as well as sperm,'' said Jackie
McGroarty, a Toronto General Hospital microbiologist who conducted
a third study.
   But she said she wouldn't recommend a woman stop using it unless
the woman suffered recurrent infections and was in a ``stable,
monogamous relationship'' that put her at low risk of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases.
   McGroarty said bladder and yeast infections cause discomfort but
aren't dangerous compared with sexually transmitted diseases or
unwanted pregnancy. Birth control pills previously have been linked
to yeast infections.
   Hooton said if women want to continue using spermicides despite
infection, they can get antibiotics for the infection.
   McGroarty presented her findings Wednesday in Anaheim during the
American Society for Microbiology's annual meeting. Hooton's
research has been submitted for publication in medical journals.
   Dr. Amy Pollack, associate medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, said she hadn't seen the studies,
but ``what she (Ms. McGroarty) is saying makes sense.''
   Phyliss Barber, regulatory affairs manager for spermicide-maker
Schmid Laboratories Inc., said she was surprised by the studies and
hadn't seen them.
   ``We definitely will be taking a look,'' she said by telephone
from Little Falls, N.J.
   Representatives of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. and Schering Corp.
had no immediate comment on the studies.
   McGroarty grew yeast and E. coli _ the bacteria responsible for
most bladder infections _ in the laboratory with nonoxynol-9 and
the kind of cells that line the vagina and urethra, or urine tube.
   In the presence of nonoxynol-9, the yeast and bacteria underwent
changes that made them stick to the cells in great numbers,
suggesting the spermicide helps the microbes colonize the vaginal
and urinary tract.
   McGroarty also found nonoxynol-9 killed lactobacilli, harmless
bacteria that grow in the vagina to protect against infections.
   The Seattle studies, which involved 130 women, found those who
used spermicides alone or with diaphragms or condoms were more
likely than other women to develop infections or to have high
levels of E. coli bacteria.
   Bladder infection, or cystitis, occurs when bacteria travel up
the urethra to the bladder. Yeast infections are vaginal
overgrowths of a fungus. Both cause burning or stinging during
urination and a frequent urge to urinate.
   Bladder infections produce strong-smelling and perhaps bloody
urine, and sometimes discomfort and fever. Yeast infections cause
itching, swelling, irritation, thick white discharge, and pain
during intercourse.

<HEAD>Report: Results of Nazi Human Experiments Scientifically Worthless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi medical experiments on concentration camp
prisoners were more than brutal and unethical, a report today
concludes. They were also bad science.
   Researchers and ethicists have been debating whether the results
of German experiments conducted during World War II should be used
by modern-day experts studying the effects of cold on the body.
   At the Dachau concentration camp, Nazi doctors plunged prisoners
into icy water, often for hours at a time, so they could test
various methods of rewarming them.
   Some experts have contended that regardless of their source, the
data should still be used to help doctors treat hypothermia, or low
body temperature. Others believe that no matter how valuable the
information, it should be ignored because of the unacceptable
methods used to obtain it.
   The latest report concludes that this long-running ethical
debate should end, because the Nazi data has no value to anyone.
   ``The implication was that there was this great information, and
we could save lives if only we could use it,'' said Dr. Robert L.
Berger, a surgeon at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
   After reviewing the original Nazi data, however, Berger
discovered that the experiments were so poorly set up and carried
out that the results cannot be believed.
   ``The data are useless,'' he said. ``It's not scientific. It
should be rejected outright. There should be no ethical discussion
over it. You don't discuss scientifically useless data. You discuss
data that have scientific merit but were obtained in an unethical
fashion.''
   Berger presented his findings and conclusions in today's issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marcia Angell, the journal's
executive editor, said, ``The notion that there exists a treasure
trove of valid information on hypothermia, from which we are
voluntarily and fastidiously holding ourselves aloof, seems to be
baseless.''
   Ethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota, who
organized a conference last year on Nazi science, said other Nazi
research into such areas as genetics and anthropology has already
been absorbed into the mainstream of science.
   ``Berger appears to give a persuasive argument that there is not
much to argue about with respect to hypothermia,'' Caplan said.
``That doesn't mean the ethical debate about Nazi science and
medicine should be dismissed out of hand.''
   Dr. Robert Pozos of the University of Washington, who in the
past has advocated use of the Nazi results, said after reading
Berger's report that the experimenters' scientific methods were
``atrocious.'' He added, ``My opinion is that the data should not
be referenced'' in other research papers. ``It should not be used.''
   The experiments were intended to find the best way to treat
victims of hypothermia, especially German fliers who were shot down
over the cold North Sea. Male civilians of various religions and
nationalities, as well as Russian prisoners of war, were forced to
participate.
   The subjects were plunged into a tank of ice water, often naked,
and then rewarmed with various methods. Some died after spending
several hours in the tank. Others were killed by the rewarming,
which included throwing the men into boiling water.
   Berger found that such basic details as the men's ages,
nutritional status, general health and blood pressures were
missing. Also frequently unrecorded were many particulars about the
experiments and their results, such as water temperatures, length
of time in the water and the survival rates after various rewarming
methods.
   Some findings were so physiologically improbable that they were
probably fabricated, Berger concluded. Among these was the
conclusion that people die of hypothermia in the water only if
their necks are submerged.
   He also noted that Dr. Sigmund Rascher, the chief experimenter,
was accused of faking other experiments and had sold saddles,
riding breeches and handbags made from human skin.
   Rascher was eventually executed by the Germans for kidnapping
children. He had claimed that his wife had three babies in quick
succession after age 48. The hoax was intended to please Heinrich
Himmler, head of the German concentration camps, by proving that
the growth of the Aryan people could be speeded up by extending
women's childbearing years.

<HEAD>Flood Plains Weren't Regulated When Texas Communities Were Built</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARRYL EWING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the swamped communities along the Trinity
River in Texas were built before zoning regulations prohibited
construction in the flood plain, officials said.
   Torrential rains two weeks ago damaged about 400 homes in
Rochester Park, a Dallas neighborhood. About 7,000 residents below
Lake Livingston, north of Houston, were warned this week to
evacuate subdivisions because of the worst flooding in 80 years.
   Both areas now have restrictions on flood plain development, but
that wasn't always the case, officials said.
   Rochester Park, most of whose residents are black, has been
flooded two years running. Its civic leaders say Dallas' failure to
provide flood protection demonstrates a lack of interest in
minority communities.
   City officials deny that.
   ``We recognized that they've been in the flood plain of the
Trinity since Rochester Park was first developed,'' said Assistant
City Manager Cliff Keheley. ``But at the time it developed, flood
plain delineation wasn't the exact science that it is today.''
   ``Today we have some strong requirements on development,'' said
Tommie McPherson of the Dallas Public Works Department. ``The
problem you have with places like Rochester Park is that you can't
make new flood control policy retroactive. It's not like we can go
in and move people out of their homes. ''
   McPherson said the Rochester Park area was developed in the
1920s and was annexed to Dallas in the early 1950s. It wasn't until
1964 that the city began flood development plans. New homes must be
at least 3 feet above the 100-year flood plain.
   Keheley said cost requirements had slowed construction of a
levee to protect the community. Officials say it will be built by
1993.
   ``In the contact that I had with the project, I didn't see any
kind of intentional neglect, and I don't think it was racially
based at all,'' Keheley said.
   At Lake Livingston, some 200 miles southeast of Dallas, the
Trinity River Authority released water through the Lake Livingston
Dam's floodgates at a record rate of 94,800 cubic feet per second
Wednesday.
   A discharge rate of 100,000 cubic feet per second level was
expected by Monday, and would last about a week, said Grady Manis,
the authority's southern region manager.
   Barry Brock, assistant city manager in Liberty, Texas, which
lies below the lake, said as much as 45 percent of city land lies
in the flood plain.
   The city enacted an ordinance in 1974 saying that new
development must be a foot above the 100-year flood plain, the
highest level water has gotten in the state during a century. But
that ordinance doesn't affect several homes built before 1974.
   ``We can't go back and make people rebuild,'' Brock said.

<HEAD>Minister Says London Being Subjected To IRA Terror Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following two Irish Republican Army bombings in
London in three days, Britain's armed forces minister says he
believes the capital is being subjected to a systematic terror
campaign.
   The official, Archie Hamilton, said the bombings _ outside an
army recruiting center Wednesday and at an army education office
Monday _ marked the first time London had seen two attacks so close
together.
   ``I think we are being subjected to a campaign of terror by them
(the IRA),'' Hamilton said in an interview with Channel 4
television Wednesday night. ``This is a new situation and we must
assume they will try elsewhere, possibly in the London area, in the
near future.''
   An army sergeant was killed and another injured in the bombing
Wednesday in Wembley in north London. The IRA, fighting to end
British rule in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the
bombing in a statement to news organizations in Dublin Wednesday
night.
   ``While the British government persists in its continued
occupation of the north of Ireland the IRA will persist in
attacking the British government and its forces in England,'' the
IRA said in a statement.
   The bomb exploded in a white unmarked army van parked behind an
army careers information office run by the Territorial Army,
Britain's part-time volunteer reserve force.
   Scotland Yard said the bomb exploded at just after Charles
Chapman and another sergeant got into the vehicle.
   Chapman, 34, was killed. The other sergeant, who was sitting in
the back of the van, suffered severe cuts, bruises and smoke
inhalation. Two passers-by were treated for shock.
   The sergeants worked at the recruiting office, on a busy
shopping street about a half mile from Wembley Stadium, one of
Britain's top sports arenas.
   Before Wednesday's explosion, 12 people had been killed and one
crippled in attacks in mainland Britain since August 1988.
   On Monday, a time bomb buried in a flower bed blew a hole in the
building housing the Directorate of Army Education at Eltham in
southeast London, injuring seven civilians. The IRA claimed
responsibility.
   Security at the facilities at Eltham and Wembley was minimal.
   The IRA has targeted British military installations in Northern
Ireland, mainland Britain and the rest of Europe since sectarian
and political violence flared in the province in 1969.
   But it has repeatedly said that in terms of publicity, one bomb
in mainland Britain is worth dozens in Northern Ireland. Ten of
London's 12 newspapers today made the Wembley attack their main
story.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Killers Executed in Missouri and Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of killing four people was executed in Missouri
today after abandoning all appeals, while a Texas inmate who
claimed to be brain damaged from sniffing glue and gasoline was put
to death for murdering his brother-in-law.
   Both men died by injection shortly after 1 a.m. EDT.
   Leonard Laws, 40, was executed for the robbery and shotgun
slayings of an elderly couple. He was the second Missouri inmate
executed in the last six days and the third this year. Six inmates
have been put to death in the United States this year.
   In Texas, 30-year-old Johnny Ray Anderson was executed for a
1981 slaying that was part of a scheme to collect $67,000 in
insurance money. On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
last-minute stay.
   Today's executions bring to 127 the number of people put to
death since the resumption of capital punishment in the United
States in 1977. Texas has had 35 executions, more than any other
state; Missouri has had four.
   The last time there were two executions on the same day was
March 15, 1988, in Louisiana and Florida.
   ``Our government has carried out its duty,'' said Missouri Gov.
John Ashcroft. ``Robbing and brutally killing elderly people for
monetary gain will not be tolerated in the state of Missouri.''
   Laws accepted his fate calmly, and indeed helped the process by
abandoning further appeals. He died wearing blue jeans instead of
gray prison pants, in accordance with one of his last requests. He
had no last words.
   An appeal by his father was refused without comment on April 30
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Laws laughed when he was sentenced to death for killing Charles
C. Williams, 83, and Lottie Williams, 72, in 1980 in rural St.
Louis County. The gunman, George Gilmore, 43, also has been
sentenced to death.
   According to trial testimony, Laws cut the telephone line and
acted as a lookout, then set the couple's house on fire.
   Laws also was convicted of killing a 65-year-old disabled man
and an 85-year-old woman, both in 1980. He was sentenced to life in
prison for those slayings.
   Johnny Ray Anderson, a sixth-grade dropout who blamed his IQ of
70 on sniffing gasoline and glue from age 5, issued a final
statement insisting he was not responsible for the fatal shooting
of Ronald Gene Goode, a 22-year-old a soft drink salesman.
   In the statement typed by a fellow death row inmate and
containing numerous misspellings, Anderson criticized the justice
system as unfair and inconsiderate of ``the victum's family.'' He
called himself ``the excape goat.''
   ``You people out there don't understand any of this, either
because you don't care enough to check, or you will have to wait
until your the one on the table getting killed, then as always it
will be to late, then you will understand how unfair the system
really is for all parties involved,'' Anderson wrote.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, who witnessed the execution,
dismissed Anderson's claims of innocence. ``Even if he was not the
person who pulled the trigger, he would still be culpable for the
murder,'' Mattox said.
   Anderson's lawyers contended in their appeals that his mental
shortcomings were not considered by the jury that gave him the
death sentence.
   The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ordered the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals to reconsider a similar case involving another
condemned man, John Henry Selvage. Anderson's appeal was based on
that case.
   Anderson's sister and Goode's wife, Laura Anderson Goode, and
Delvin Johnson were convicted of murder, sentenced to life in
prison and paroled last year. Anderson's mother, Rowena, was
acquitted of capital murder in the case.

   Sammy Davis Jr., the exuberant
song-and-dance man who started as a goggle-eyed child vaudevillian
and battled to the glittery top of the entertainment world, died
Wednesday of throat cancer at age 64.
   Davis performed on stage, on television and in the movies as an
actor, singer, dancer and impressionist _ a powerhouse packed into
a bantam, 5-foot-6 frame.
   His hit songs included ``Something's Gotta Give'' (1955), ``I've
Gotta Be Me'' (1969) and ``The Candy Man'' (1972). His films
included ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``Oceans 11'' ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
   Davis began as a tap-dancing toddler in Harlem.
   His energetic performances and upbeat manner were therapy for a
life scarred by bigotry, failed marriages, drug and alcohol abuse
and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer.

   Jim Henson, who gave his voice to Kermit the
Frog and his creative spirit to a multitude of Muppets, died
Wednesday of pneumonia at age 53.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. They made their debut on a
Washington TV program and appeared regularly on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.'' But their popularity exploded after they began appearing on
``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   Later, Henson's ``The Muppet Show'' won three Emmys during its
five-year run and became the most widely seen TV program in the
world.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie,'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' and ``The
Muppets Take Manhattan.''
   He also won another Emmy for ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' a special
on NBC.
   Henson also won a Peabody for excellence in TV programming and a
Grammy for a Muppet album. His Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies,'' won four consecutive Emmys for outstanding
animated program.

<HEAD>Alaska Airlines Flight Attendants Report Sickness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 flight attendants for Alaska Airlines
have reported suffering nausea, headaches and other health problems
during several dozen flights in the last eight months, the
attendants' union said.
   The Association of Flight Attendants said some passengers also
have complained of develping headaches or feeling strange.
   Some attendants said they think the problems are caused by bad
air in the jets. In many cases, they said, the symptoms cleared up
when they left the aircraft or were treated with oxygen.
   Airline President Bruce Kennedy suggested the fears were
unfounded. He said Wednesday the company had received no formal
complaints from passengers and had logged fewer than 50 from
attendants.
   ``I think we need at this point to back up from the notion that
air quality is the source of the problem,'' Kennedy said. ``I think
that a strong case can be made for the notion that the power of
suggestion is operating here.''
   Bill Cox, a company vice president, said problems had been
reported on about three dozen flights out of roughly 13,000 and
often involved just one or two of the four attendants aboard.
   The union said symptoms have included dizziness, confusion,
swollen lymph glands, blurred vision, vomiting, weakness and other
problems _ some lasting for weeks.
   The first reports of illness came July 29, involving four flight
attendants on a Seattle to Orange County, Calif., flight. They were
unable to make the return flight; several did not work for a month
or more.
   Airline officials were unable to find anything wrong with the
plane, and doctors could not determine what made the attendants
sick.
   After reports of health problems persisted, the Seattle-based
airline sought help from University of Washington specialists and
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
   ``It's frustrating,'' Cox has said. ``We can't find any problems
to fix.''
   Cox said the complaints concerned about 15 of the airline's 57
aircraft. He said eight or so reports were linked to specific
problems, such as a fuel leak in one plane and smoke from a galley
oven in another plane.
   After the initial report in July and discussions with the
Federal Aviation Administration, Alaska Airlines said it agreed to
clear air grilles, place air-sample bottles on aircraft and analyze
cargo aboard when problems occurred.
   ``Not one indication was given that there was any problem with
the air quality aboard an airplane,'' said Ray Vecci, an executive
vice president.
   Cox said cargo has since been ruled out as a source because
there has been no hazardous material aboard the flights involved
except for one.
   No pilots have complained of the symptoms.

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was in
stable condition today after doctors determined he is suffering
from pneumonia, hospital officials said.
   ``Everything is under control. It was recommended that he rest a
little, and he is receiving antibiotics,'' said Orna Cohen,
spokeswoman of Shaarei Tzedek Hospital.
   Begin, 76, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in making
peace with Egypt, was brought to Shaarei Tzedek on Wednesday by
ambulance after complaining of weakness.
   He slept through the night after undergoing tests, Mrs. Cohen
said.
   Begin's daughters Hasia and Leah and one of his granddaughters
have been staying with him since he arrived at the hospital, the
spokeswoman said.
   Begin's son, Benjamin, a member of parliament representing the
right-wing Likud party which his father founded, is overseas.
   Begin, who became prime minister in 1977, abruptly resigned in
September 1983 and has since lived in seclusion in Jerusalem. Aides
said at the time that Begin was depressed over the death of his
wife, Aliza, and because of Israel's unsuccessful war in Lebanon
which cost 650 Israeli lives.
   While serving as prime minister, Begin suffered several heart
attacks. In 1986 he underwent prostate surgery. He was briefly
hospitalized in 1987 and in 1989 after complaining of weakness.

   Two Jewish followers of a messianic cult
acknowleged they desecrated more than 300 Jewish graves in hopes
that Arabs would be suspected and Jews would then unite against
perceived Arab hostility, police said today.
   The two men confessed Wednesday night after initially denying
involvement, Haifa police official Yonah Shlomo said.
   The official said 41-year-old David Goldner admitted he
spray-painted 303 graves at a cemetery in the northern port city on
Sunday with anti-Semitic slogans in Hebrew such as ``Kill the
Jews.''
   Gershon Tannenbaum, 32, also agreed to cooperate with police,
Shlomo said. The Davar newspaper quoted Tannenbaum as saying he
watched the desecration but did not participate.
   Goldner recently quit his job as a computer scientist involved
in weapons development and joined a messianic group, Israel media
said. In the weeks prior to Sunday's desecration, Goldner lived at
the graveyard, Israel radio quoted police as saying.
   Davar quoted Goldner as saying: ``I wanted to unite the nation
of Israel which is involved in internal arguments while it faces
danger from Arab nations.''
   Goldner originally denied he carried out the vandalism, but when
he was remanded in police custody for 15 days on Tuesday he told
reporters: ``I was fulfilling a sacred mission.''
   A Haifa court on Wednesday remanded Tannenbaum into custody for
12 days.
   Israel radio said Tannenbaum persuaded Goldner to join him in a
group that practices a mystic form of Judaism based on the belief
it can hasten the arrival of the messiah.
   National Police Commissioner Yaakov Turner said Goldner and
Tannenbaum were probably inspired by the desecration last week of
34 graves in the French town of Carpentras where the body of an
81-year-old man was dug up and impaled on an umbrella.
   The Haifa desecration sparked anger among Haifa's Jewish
residents and some accused Arabs of the vandalism. Moslem leaders
immediately condemned the desecration.

   Radicals trying to elect populist Boris N. Yeltsin
president of the Soviet Union's vast Russian republic won their
first battle, forcing his opponent to defend his performance as
premier.
   In balloting on procedural issues late Wednesday, delegates by a
one-vote margin, 495-494, voted to delay the election of the
republic's president, and then voted 551-442 to require a report
from Premier Alexander V. Vlasov on the state of the republic.
   Stanislav Yelisiekin, a supporter of Yeltsin, said the move was
intended to force Vlasov into giving an accounting of the
republic's disastrous economic and social problems prior to
balloting.
   Russia is the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
stretching from Leningrad on the Gulf of Finland to Moscow and on
through Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. It contains 52 percent of the
Soviet Union's 290 million people and three-quarters of its land
mass.
   Many Russians feel their wealth is supporting the other 14
Soviet republics, and both Yeltsin and Vlasov have taken up the
issue of sovereignty in their platforms.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass has said some Russian
lawmakers are demanding independence, like the three Baltic
republics and groups in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Ukraine.
   Vlasov is supported by Mikhail S. Gorbachev against Yeltsin, the
Soviet president's most popular rival who contends the Soviet
leadership has made only half-hearted efforts to solve the
country's problems.
   Gorbachev underscored the importance of the struggle by
appearing on the balcony as an observer for the second day today to
watch the parliament struggle slowly through largely procedural
matters.
   The radicals are hoping to wrest control of the republic's
affairs from the national government. Some are calling for Russian
laws to take priority over national laws, and a few are even going
so far as to demand that Russia to secede from the Soviet Union.
   The first stage of the struggle is the election of the
parliament's chairman, or president.
   With Gorbachev watching, the deputies voted 650-243 to elect
their president immediately after Vlasov's speech, without
discussing any of the candidates.
   There was no immediate word on when Vlasov would speak, or when
the election would be held.
   There are three lesser-known possible contenders for the job of
the Russian presidency: Yuri Manayenkov, a national Communist Party
secretary; Ivan Polozhkov, a hardline conservative opponent of
market-oriented reforms; and Arkady Volsky, who from more than a
year was the head of the committee trying to keep order in
Nagorno-Karabakh region between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.

   Arizona has a new Martin Luther King holiday on
the books, but the 15-year struggle that cost the state millions in
lost convention business isn't over yet.
   Opponents of the holiday said their campaign to put the issue
before the voters would begin today, one day after Gov. Rose
Mofford signed a bill designating the third Monday in January as a
paid holiday in King's memory for state employees.
   Mrs. Mofford cut short a trip to Tucson to fly back to Phoenix
and sign the bill hours after it won final passage in the House.
   ``This is a great day for Arizona, an especially great day for
Governor Mofford because my wish has come true,'' Mrs. Mofford said.
   The House passed the bill 35-25. The Senate passed it 16-14 on
Tuesday.
   Passage was the culmination of a 15-year struggle to designate a
King holiday.
   Controversy over it has dogged the state's politicians for
years. Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbit declared a holiday by
proclamation in 1986. His successor, Gov. Evan Mecham, rescinded it
days before it would have taken effect.
   The ensuing uproar included marches, tourist boycotts and
convention cancellations. The furor also fueled a recall drive
against Mecham, but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds
before the recall vote could be held.
   Opponents say an extra holiday would cost the state $500,000 to
$3.5 million. Supporters contend conventions and meetings canceled
over Arizona's failure to create a holiday cost the state about $25
million in 1987-88.
   Mrs. Mofford signed the bill in a conference room packed with
political, religious and business leaders who had campaigned for
passage. She also spoke by speakerphone with Coretta Scott King,
widow of the civil rights leader.
   ``The people of Arizona now have a great opportunity to put
aside the politics of polarization and use this holiday to promote
interracial cooperation, healing and good will,'' Mrs. King told
the governor.
   The measure repeals a bill passed in September that created a
King holiday but eliminated the state's paid Columbus Day holiday.
   Opponents of the King-for-Columbus law collected enough
signatures to get the measure placed on the ballot, and they said
they would try to force a referendum on the new law as well.
   Julian Sanders, an architect who spearheaded the petition drive
on the first bill, said the new campaign would begin today.
Opponents have 90 days to collect the 43,350 signatures needed for
a referendum.
   Mrs. Mofford said she was hopeful the referendum drive would
fail. She said Arizona needs to put the issue to rest. ``Not only
has it affected the economy, but it has hurt us nationally. We are
considered a racist state,'' she said.
   During debate on the bill, state Rep. Brenda Burns, a Republican
who had pushed for a public vote, said the issue is ``no longer
just an issue of whether to support the Martin Luther King
holiday.''
   ``It has become an issue of whether or not we take away the
people's right to vote,'' she said.
   Rep. Jim Skelly, a Republican, broke with his fellow
conservatives in opposing a referendum. ``We are elected
representatives and our job as elected representatives is to pass
legislation,'' he said.
   Forty-seven other states have a holiday honoring King. The other
states without official King holidays are Montana and New Hampshire.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reversing its decades-old
policy of segregated health services, the government has declared
public hospitals open to all races.
   The decision Wednesday was the latest in a series of reforms
since President F.W. de Klerk took office in August.
   The anti-apartheid National Medical and Dental Association
welcomed the change.
   ``We hope this example will be followed quickly in bringing
about an end to other obstacles toward a free and democratic South
Africa,'' the group said.
   Health Minister Rina Venter said the decision was effective
immediately and that patients staying at overcrowded black
hospitals now could be moved to underutilized white hospitals.
   Venter told Parliament in Cape Town that all hospitals must be
available to all South Africans for the country's health system to
run effectively.
   ``All hospitals are now accessible to all people in South
Africa,'' Venter said in an interview after leaving Parliament.
   Asked if she was worried about the reaction from conservative
whites, Venter said, ``No. I think (integrated hospitals) will be
in the interests of all our people.''
   Schools and neighborhoods now remain the main segregated
institutions in South Africa. Also, the country's 28 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs.
   De Klerk has pledged to dismantle apartheid and wants to
negotiate a new constitution that will bring blacks into the
national government. However, he opposes outright black majority
rule.
   The decision to integrate health services should help alleviate
overcrowding at many black hospitals.
   For example, Johannesburg General Hospital, which is for whites,
has an occupancy rate of about 50 percent. In contrast, hundreds of
black patients sleep on the floor at Baragwanath Hospital, the only
hospital in the nearby black township of Soweto.
   Traditionally, white hospitals treated blacks in need of
emergency or specialized care but transferred them to black
hospitals as soon as it was feasible.
   The staff at public hospitals has been integrated for years. At
many private hospitals, both patients and staff already are fully
integrated.
   In other developments:
   _Defense Minister Magnus Malan told Parliament the military was
considering integrating some army units.
   _Deputy Education Minister Piet Marais said the government was
considering combining education departments separated along racial
lines into a single bureaucracy. However, Marais gave no indication
the government intended to integrate public schools.

<HEAD>Dollar Stable as Market Awaits U.S. Trade Figures, Gold Steady</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was stable in calm European trading
today and traders said they expected little movement until after
the U.S. trade figures for March were released later in the day.
   ``The trade figures will set the market tone for the rest of the
session,'' one trader in Milan said.
   According to an Associated Press-Dow Jones survey of economists,
the trade deficit was expected to have widened to $7.6 billion from
$6.49 billion in February.
   On Wednesday, a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent rise in U.S.
consumer prices in April took some of the steam out of the dollar
on expectations that U.S. interest rates might decline.
   Gold remained largely unchanged as buillon dealers also awaited
the U.S. merchandise trade figures.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 152 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a lower rate of 151.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6360 West German marks, down from 1.6431
   _1.3981 Swiss francs, down from 1.3990
   _5.5228 French francs, up from 5.5410
   _1.8420 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8505
   _1204.65 Italian lire, down from 1208.50
   _1.1730 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1756
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6927, compared with $1.6805 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $369.25 a troy ounce,
down from $370 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $369.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $369.35, down from $369.85 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 66 cents to close at a bid
$370.15.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.03 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.05.

<BYLINE>TAKEOVER GONE GOOD: Long John Silver's Thrives After Debt-Financed
Deal</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The enormous publicity over the downfall of
junk bonds and debt-financed takeovers has obscured what might be a
surprising fact: some companies bought with borrowed money are not
only surviving but doing well. One of the most visible examples is
Jerrico Inc., parent of seafood chain Long John Silver's, acquired
in a $620 million buyout last September. Since then the company has
cut millions of dollars in costs, sold unwanted assets and
concentrated on making seafood competitive with burgers and pizza
for America's convenience-minded palates. ``We get the energy
released inside the company,'' one of the new owners says. ``We
take the lid off.''

   The chief censor raided the
government TV station and confiscated film after the network
broadcast an American movie with a graphic rape scene, the official
said today.
   Peoples Television broadcast the film ``The Silent Witness'' on
Tuesday night, substituting it quickly when a championship
basketball game was unexpectedly interrupted. The film includes a
scene in which a woman is stripped and attacked by three men.
   Such scenes violate censorship regulations in this predominately
Roman Catholic country.
   Manuel Morato, chairman of the censorship board, said irate
viewers telephoned his office Tuesday to complain. He rushed to the
station and confiscated the tape after the movie ended, he said.
   Morato said he had referred the case to his legal department for
possible criminal charges. Station officials claimed they did not
have time to screen the film after the unexpected interruption of
the basketball game.
   ``I have to do my job, even if the government is an offender,''
Morato said.

<HEAD>Alleged Contract Killer for Medellin Drug Cartel Brought to U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An alleged contract killer for the
Medellin drug cartel was arrested in Honduras and flown to the
United States, where he was charged in a gangland-style slaying
here six years ago, police said.
   Guillermo Leon ``Chiruza'' Velasquez, 33, of Medellin, Colombia,
is linked to at least seven murders in South Florida and to other
drug-related killings in his homeland, police said Wednesday.
   He was ``considered an enforcer, an assassin'' for the Medellin
drug cartel, said David Steele, a spokesman for Hollywood police.
``His main goal was to kill people on demand if they crossed the
path of Blanco.''
   Police said Velasquez worked for Griselda Blanco, known as the
``Black Widow'' while she headed one of Colombia's most powerful
drug families. Blanco was convicted of conspiring to import cocaine
in 1985 and is serving a 25-year prison sentence in New York.
   Velasquez was taken into custody in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, by Hollywood, Fla., detectives on Tuesday, police said.
   Because Velasquez is a Colombian citizen, the Honduran
government had no obligation to go through formal extradiction
proceedings, they said. And the Colombian government would not let
him back in that country because of his alleged ties to
drug-related murders there, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale
reported today.
   Velasquez, brought to the United States late Tuesday, is being
held at the Broward County Jail, where he awaits arraignment and a
bond hearing.
   He was charged with first-degree murder in the July 6, 1984,
slaying of Rodrigo Atehortua, a Colombian who lived in Hollywood.
   Atehortua was shot 18 times when he opened the front door of his
home, because of a drug debt to a Colombian drug czar, police said.
   A six-year investigation by the FBI, the federal Drug
Enforcement Agency and Metro-Dade police tied Velasquez to a
network of drug deals and ripoffs, police said.
   ``It involves the same kind of narco-terrorism that now has the
Colombian government almost paralyzed,'' Hollywood Police Chief
Richard Witt said.
   Velasquez is also suspected in the torture-slaying of
Atehortua's 15-year-old stepson, John Henry Garcia, who was found
blindfolded and shot once in the back of the head near Delray Beach
a day after his stepfather was killed, police said.

   Radical students hurling rocks and
firebombs fought police about a dozen cities today on the eve of
the 10th anniversary of a bloody 1980 anti-government uprising.
   Meanwhile, thousands of assembly workers at the nation's leading
car plant remained off the job for a third day.
   The nation's entire police force of 130,000 was put on alert
after a major dissident coalition called for nationwide protests
this week to mark the anniversary of the May 18, 1980 rebellion in
the southern city of Kwangju.
   The uprising, brutally put down by troops and tanks, left at
least 200 people dead and seared the psyche of Koreans more than
any other incident since the 1950 Korean War.
   The nationwide dissident group called the People's Alliance
announced in Seoul Wednesday that it would organize a series of
protests in Seoul and 16 other cities this week. The alliance was a
major force behind the May 9 nationwide protests, the largest and
most violent since 1987.
   Radicals and dissidents demand the ouster of President Roh
Tae-woo, saying the merger of his governing party with two
opposition groups into the new Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)
earlier this year was a political coup and marks a return to
dictatorial rule.
   The semiofficial Moonhwa Broadcasting Co. said about 20,000
students were involved in today's protests on about 50 campuses.
Police reported arrests and injuries in today's clashes but gave no
figures.
   In Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, about 1,000 students
clashed with riot police around Chonnam University, hurling rocks
and firebombs.
   Police fired barrages of tear gas from two armored vans, sending
clouds of the choking gas billowing over the school's main gate.
Students threw hundreds of firebombs and rocks.
   ``Disband DLP!,'' students shouted as they charged police in
drizzling rain. ``Drive out yankees!,'' they also screamed,
claiming the United States masterminded the formation of Roh's
gigantic party.
   Similar protests were reported in at least 13 cities, including
Seoul, Taejon, Pusan, Chonju, Iri, Sunchon and Mokpo but details
were unavailable.
   In Seoul, about 1,500 students formed a new radical group
seeking alliance with workers and fought vicious battles with riot
police in front of state-run Seoul National University.
   In the 10-day Kwangju rebellion of 1980, government documents
show about 200 people were killed and more than 1,700 others
injured or wounded when troops and tanks crushed the revolt.
Dissidents claim the death toll was much higher.
   In the southeastern industrial town of Ulsan, 27,000 assembly
workers of the Hyundai Motor Co. remained off their jobs after
halting production at the nation's largest car marker on Tuesday.
   The plant, a subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, makes 2,650
vehicles a day and sold 589,000 cars last year, including 200,000
in the United States and other nations.
   Hyundai workers went on strike after talks on a new contract
failed to make progress. Union officials reported ``some progress''
in marathon talks but said both sides were still apart over some
key issues, including a shorter work week and more benefits.

   Despite the death of Jim Henson, Ponce D.
Lion and the other Muppets he created will still get a series on
the Disney Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be
produced as planned, a Disney spokesman said.
   Henson, who sold rights to the immensely popular Muppets to Walt
Disney Co. last year for a reported $150 million, died Wednesday at
age 53.
   The long-term deal that brought Kermit and Miss Piggy to the
Disney menagerie included Henson's creative services as well as the
use of the Muppet characters, which are seen on TV in 100
countries. It was announced last August, but is still not final.
   Henson's office in New York declined comment on how the death
would affect the agreement with Disney. But Disney spokesman Erwin
Okun said, ``I've talked with the key people involved in the deal,
and they expect everything will proceed as usual.''
   ``He will be sorely missed, no question. But the Henson
organization is great,'' Okun said. ``Even with a giant, as he was,
it's not just a one-man organization.''
   ``Jim would be the first to say, `The show must go on,''' said
Dick Nunis, a Disney executive in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
   Still, Henson's death added a note of uncertainty to future
Disney projects, if not the ones under way.
   Henson's creations and talent were a key part of Disney Co.
Chairman Michael Eisner's plans to cross-market characters
worldwide through films, cable and network TV, retail stores,
restaurants, home video, character licensing, theme parks and
resorts.
   Analyst Jeff Logsdon at the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. brokerage in
Los Angeles noted that the Muppets are probably second only to
Disney in worldwide recognition. Eisner called the alliance a
``marriage made in family entertainment heaven.''
   In an interview this year with The Associated Press, Henson said
he was happy to see his characters frolicking in the Disney
environments.
   ``I love the parks,'' Henson said. ``They have been among my
favorite places for years. Now that I'm actually designing things
for the parks, I'm having a lot of fun.''
   ``Obviously he was a great creative spark and a genius, and his
loss will be felt,'' said Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch
entertainment analyst. ``He would have come up with lots of others
things if he'd lived another 10 or 15 years.

<HEAD>Extradition From Syria of Eichmann Deputy Requested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has asked Syria to extradite the man
considered the most important Nazi criminal still at large _ an
aide to Adolf Eichmann convicted of sending more than 120,000 Jews
to German death camps.
   Alois Brunner, 78, has been living in Damascus since 1955. Syria
has consistently denied his presence although he has been
photographed and interviewed at his heavily guarded home in the
Syrian capital.
   The extradition request was presented Wednesday in Damascus by
East German Ambassador Karl-Heinz Lugenheim, said Nazi hunter Serge
Klarsfeld.
   An East German Foreign Ministry spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, confirmed in East Berlin that Lugenheim had
been instructed to request the extradition. The spokesman gave no
further details.
   Brunner was sentenced to death in absentia twice in 1954, in
Paris and Marseille, for taking part in the deportation of more
than 120,000 Jews from France to German death camps.
   After 40 years of denial, East Germany recently admitted its
responsibility in Nazi war crimes, formally apologizing to the
world Jewish community and announcing it would pay reparations.
East Germany joins France, Austria and West Germany in requesting
Brunner's extradition.
   According to the World Jewish Congress, the Austrian-born
Brunner is responsibe for the deaths of more than 125,000 Austrian,
French, Greek and Czechoslovak Jews.
   Hitler made Eichmann the chief of the Gestapo Bureau for Jewish
Affairs and assigned him to prepare ``The Final Solution,'' the
extermination of European Jewry. Israel hanged Eichmann in 1962 for
crimes against the Jews.
   After the war, Brunner was temporarily detained by American and
British officials but kept his identity secret.
   He was tracked down in Syria under the name Georg Fischer in the
late 1950s by Austrian Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and officially
identified by Klarsfeld and his wife, Beate, in 1982.
   The Klarsfelds have lobbied actively for Brunner's extradition.
In January, Serge, a Paris lawyer, was expelled from Syria after
planning a public debate on Brunner.
   Beate Klarsfeld has devoted her life to bringing war criminals
to justice. In February, she met with East German prosecutor Horst
Busse to discuss the Brunner affair.
   In 1985, he was photographed at his home by Bunte, a West German
news magazine, and showed no remorse for his crimes.
   ``I'm not sorry I killed those vermin,'' he was quoted as
telling interviewers.
   Two years later, he told an American newspaper in a telephone
interview that the Jews deserved to be killed because they were
agents of the devil. He said if he had to do it over again, he
would.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld has said the Israeli secret services also found
Brunner. She said they were probably behind the letter bombs that
cost him an eye and several fingers.

<HEAD>China Criticizes U.S., Amnesty International Over Human Rights</HEAD>

   China today accused the United States of engaging
in a smear campaign over Beijing's human rights record and denied
Amnesty International's charges of widespread violations.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua, speaking at a weekly
briefing, also said recent student demonstrations in Bulgaria, the
Soviet Union and Hong Kong in support of pro-democracy students in
China were ``inappropriate'' and based on ignorance.
   Ms. Li expressed China's strong protest over a proclamation
signed Saturday by President Bush that named a national day in
support of human rights. The proclamation called on the Chinese
government to ``respond positively'' to the aspirations of the
pro-democracy movement crushed by military force last year.
   Ms. Li said: ``We have all along been opposed to interfering in
China's domestic affairs and smearing and attacking the Chinese
government by the U.S. Congress on the pretext of freedom and human
rights.''
   She said China was resentful of the human rights proclamation
and had expressed such feelings through diplomatic channels.
   The spokeswoman also said the report Wednesday of the human
rights group Amnesty International chronicling the arrests of
political activists in last year's demonstrations was ``totally
unfounded and unreasonable.''
   She said the arrest and trial of ``criminals'' was China's
sovereign right and no country or organization had the right to
interfere in China's internal affairs.
   Amnesty International, based in London, said it sent Premier Li
Peng a list of 650 names of people arrested since the crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement in June. The group asked for information
on what had happened to them.
   China announced last week that it had released 211 people
detained for nearly a year in connection with the demonstrations.
It said 431 were still under investigation. Foreign and Chinese
analysts believe the number still being held without charges or
trial is in the thousands.
   Li said the quelling of what the government calls the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' last year ``has won the
understanding and support of most other countries.''
   Referring to recent demonstrations in Bulgaria, Soviet Union and
Hong Kong in support of Chinese students, she said: ``We can only
express our regret over the inappropriate actions taken by some
people in some countries due to ignorance of the truth of the
Tiananmen Square incident.''
   China's human rights record has been the central issue in its
deteriorating relations with the United States and other Western
countries since the violent suppression of the democracy movement.
   Washington says China has made only minimal improvements in
human rights since then, year, and some members of Congress are
calling on Bush to show U.S. disapproval by ending most-favored
nation status on Chinese imports.
   Bush, who has until June 3 to make a decision on whether to
renew China's favored trading status, said Wednesday, ``I don't
want to send a signal that we're happy with their (China's) human
rights record. ... It isn't an easy call.''

   Actress Paulette Goddard left New York
University more than $20 million and the papers of her late
husband, novelist Erich Maria Remarque, the university said today.
   Miss Goddard, who died April 23 in Switzerland, endowed seven
new professorships with $1.2 million each, NYU President John
Brademas said. They are in film, urban planning, creative writing,
literature, European studies, languages and political economy.
   In addition, her bequest provided three $1 million scholarships,
$3 million to establish a fund to attract and assist junior faculty
and $7 million for a special endowment, Brademas said.
   The university plans to name a residence hall for Miss Goddard.

   Profits from the autobiography of convicted
murderer Jean Harris must be turned over to the State Crime Victims
Board, a state appeals court held.
   Ms. Harris wanted the $90,000 in profits to go to a fund for the
children of inmates at a Westchester County prison where the former
private-school headmistress is serving 15 years to life for
murdering her lover, diet book author Dr. Herman Tarnower.
   The Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan
ruled Wednesday that the ``Son of Sam'' law applies in Ms. Harris'
case. Under the law, known by a nickname of '70s serial killer
David Berkowitz, profits that criminals make from recounting their
crimes must go to their victims or victims' families _ in this
case, Tarnower's survivors.
   Ms. Harris said she would appeal to the Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court.

   A 2-year-old girl asleep in her bedroom
was killed today by one of several artillery shells fired during a
renewed exchange between rival Christian forces battling for
control of their battered enclave.
   Police said a man was also killed and seven people wounded in
the bombardment that followed a short-lived cease-fire called at 9
p.m. Wednesday by the Maronite Catholic church, which claims the
warring commanders as members.
   The girl died when a shell pierced her bedroom in east Beirut's
Sin el-Fil district. The wounded included four women in an
underground shelter in Ashrafiyeh, the main stronghold of the
Lebanese Forces militia.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 1,031 dead and
2,769 wounded since the battle between troops of rebel Gen. Michel
Aoun and the Lebanese Forces commander, Samir Geagea, broke out
Jan. 30.
   Police said the shelling, which engulfed most of the
310-square-mile enclave, picked up only two hours after the
cease-fire plea and continued to rage this morning.
   It was the second cease-fire appeal by the church in three days.
Dozens of previous truce accords in the 4-month-old Christian war
have collapsed.
   Shells shook Christian east Beirut as well as Kesrouan province
and the pinewoods of Metn northeast of the capital as Aoun's
gunners and Geagea's militiamen traded rocket and artillery fire.
   Both sides accused each other of starting the bombardment, which
alternated between raging exchanges and sporadic fire.
   Police said fire engines were battling fires which broke out in
several apartment buildings and gas stations in the enclave,
covering the clear blue sky with palls of black smoke.
   Aoun's 19,000 army troops have failed to overpower Geagea's
6,000 street fighters, who control two-thirds of the enclave. Aoun
holds the presidential palace in suburban Baabda. He has refused to
hand it over to Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi because he
contends Hrawi's election by parliament on Nov. 24 was
unconstitutional. Geagea supports Hrawi.
   The conflict, the worst inter-Christian confrontation in
Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war, has forced more than 400,000 of
the enclave's 1 million inhabitants to flee to safer, predominately
Moslem areas or overseas havens.
   The Chamber of Commerce and Industry has estimated damage at
more than $1 billion.

   An international commission today
urged nations that oppose the forced repatriation of Vietnamese
boat people to establish and finance refugee centers on their own
soil.
   One delegate said the call was aimed at countries such as the
United States, which has condemned Hong Kong for sending back
Vietnamese refugees.
   Thailand and Malaysia sponsored the statement, which was
released at the opening session of a conference of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees committee on Indochinese refugees.
   The statement was endorsed by all delegations except the United
States and Norway, which expressed reservations, conference sources
said. No formal vote was taken because the conference was still
under way.
   U.S. and Norwegian representatives felt the statement should
have accentuated positive developments, such as a decrease in the
numbers leaving Vietnam, said Herman Laurel, a member of the
Philippine delegation.
   ``This is mostly directed at the U.S. and Vietnam,'' he said,
adding that Asian nations ``took the initiative out of their
frustration on the continuing problem'' of Indochinese who leave
for economic and not political reasons.
   On Wednesday, the British government announced it had suggested
that the United States take 9,000 Vietnamese boat people from Hong
Kong and house them in a special camp, possibly on the American
island of Guam.
   In Manila, U.S. delegates refused to comment on the issue until
the conference ends Friday.
   Meanwhile, three boats carrying 222 Cambodians trying to reach
Australia reached Indonesia, bringing to more than 400 the number
of Cambodian boat people landing there in the last two weeks, a
navy officer said today.
   In the statement, so-called ``countries of temporary refuge,''
those where boat people land first, urged Vietnam to take effective
measures to prevent its people from leaving their homeland
illegally.
   The statement said the repatriation of those not considered
political refugees was needed to prevent Asian nations from being
flooded with Indochinese who do not qualify for settlement in the
United States or other third countries.
   ``There is an obligation on any country which opposes the
repatriation of non-refugees who do not volunteer (to return home)
to offer an effective intermediate solution, such as the setting up
and financing on its own territory a regional holding center for
all non-refugees,'' the statement said.
   It said that if no workable, intermediate solution can be agreed
upon, ``temporary refuge countries must reserve the right to take
such unilateral action as they deem necessary to safeguard their
national interests.''
   Vietnam expressed reservations about accepting people who dont'
want to return.
   The 10 Asian countries participating were: Thailand, Malaysia,
China, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam
and Indonesia. Others included United States, Britain, Soviet
Union, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, West Germany, Vatican, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland.

<HEAD>Aquino Suggests Medical, Other Supplies to Defer U.S. Bases `Debt'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today
suggested the United States could provide medical and other
supplies to defer the $222 million that Manila claims Washington
owes for use of its six military bases.
   U.S. and Philippine negotiators agreed to extend their talks
into tonight after a fourth day of meetings on whether to extend
the bases when their lease expires in September 1991.
   ``We are trying to hammer out differences,'' said Philippine
spokesman Rafael Alunan. ``I believe that they are inching toward
some sort of agreement'' on the debt issue.
   The alleged debt has emerged as a major stumbling block in the
talks.
   Philippine delegates claim the United States had fallen behind
by $222.6 million in aid promised in return for use of the bases.
U.S. officials say Washington fell only $96 million short of its
aid target.
   ``We have not conceded that there is a shortfall,'' Stanley
Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. panel, said today. ``We have lived
up to our commitment, and we have made our best effort.''
   The chief U.S. delegate, Richard Armitage, was quoted Wednesday
as saying he would not ``stand next to a cash register'' while
trying to settle the question. President Bush said he would study
alternative locations for the bases if the negotiations fail.
   The two sides also disagree on the termination date for the 1947
agreement on the bases. In 1966, the two governments shortened the
lease period and agreed that either party could terminate the bases
after 25 years with one year's notice.
   The Philippine panel maintains that its constitution, drafted by
a committee appointed by Mrs. Aquino, bans foreign bases as of
September 1991 unless a new treaty has been ratified. The United
States says the bases should be allowed to remain for a year after
that even if there is no new agreement.
   Schrager said the delegations agreed to talk all night if need
be.
   ``We're still talking and ... will probably spend the rest of
the night to come out with an arrangement,'' he said. Armitage
planned to leave the Philippines on Friday but was to return if
both sides decide to continue the talks.
   Some U.S. and Philippine officials have suggested the aid
shortfall could be made up by delivering excess military equipment
from American units in Western Europe.
   ``Perhaps these medical facilities could be included in our
talks with the U.S. panel on the matter of the shortfall,'' Mrs.
Aquino said during a speech at a veterans center today. Mrs. Aquino
also said it was too early to say whether the panels had reached an
impasse.
   A classified memorandum prepared in February by the American
desk of the Department of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. Congress
was reluctant to increase aid to the Philippines because of
perceived weak leadership and mismanagement by the Aquino
government.
   The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
suggested that the government publicly demand full U.S. funding for
the bases as well as other aid programs.
   But the memo recommended Manila quietly lobby the United States
to make up the shortfall for the bases on the private understanding
that the Philippines would accept a lower figure in aid under the
international aid program inaugurated last year.
   Any agreement on the bases would need the approval of the
Philippine Senate, where opposition is running high.
   The current talks are considered exploratory, to determine
whether the two governments will begin formal negotiations on a new
agreement.
   The two sides could also decide to proceed to formal
negotiations or simply end the talks and begin deliberations on a
schedule for closing the installations, officials added.

   A human rights report today urged international
protection of Arab children and said 159 were killed by bullets,
beatings and tear gas and up to 63,000 injured during the first two
years of the Palestinian uprising.
   The study, sponsored by the Swedish Save the Children group,
claimed that Israel's army practiced ``calculated cruelty'' in some
cases.
   The findings were rejected by the office of Brig. Gen. Nachman
Shai, the army spokesman, and criticized by Israeli human rights
activists as one-sided.
   In another development, the World Health Organization's annual
assembly today adopted a resolution that cited worsening health
conditions of the Arab population in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The vote in Geneva was 105-2, with only the United States and
Israel voting against. Five countries abstained and another 55
nations were absent.
   The resolution, co-sponsored by 36 nations, expresses concern at
the ``deterioration of health conditions'' and at Israeli's refusal
to permit WHO experts to investigate the health situation in the
territories.
   Israel said the health situation in the occupied territories had
improved.
   Responding to the allegations by the Swedish group, an army
spokesman, Maj. Moshe Fogel, said pro-PLO activists used children
as shields during protests and were responsible for their injuries.
   ``We are faced with an uprising which turns its children into
martyrs and actually encourages minors to participate in violent
activities against Israeli soldiers, whether actively or
passively,'' he said.
   Thomas Hammarberg, head of the Swedish group and a former
secretary-general of Amnesty International, said Israeli leaders
failed to investigate abuses adequately and gave soldiers the
impression they could do as they liked.
   ``It could be the soldiers believe plastic and rubber-coated
bullets are non-lethal,'' he said in an interview. ``But I think it
begins to take the form of the intentional if they let it continue
when they know the consequences.''
   The report examined how children 16 and under suffered physical
injuries and the effects of collective punishments such as school
closures, curfews, house demolitions, raids and economic sanctions.
   It concluded: ``In view of the Palestinian community's
difficulty in protecting its children and the inadequacy of
safeguards dependent upon Israeli government enforcement,
protection of Palestinian children ... becomes an urgent matter in
need of immediate consideration by the international community.''
   The report said 159 children, aged 16 and under, were killed in
the first two years of the uprising against Israeli rule of the
occupied lands. The uprising began in December 1987. The report
said 106 of the 159 children were fatally shot. So far this year,
13 children have been shot to death, the report said.
   The army says 79 children under the age of 14 were fatally
wounded in the last 29 months. It does not have a figure for
victims 16 and under.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories says 148 children 16 and under had died through May 1.
Spokeswoman Zahava Galon said tear gas deaths were excluded as too
difficult to substantiate and that no reliable injury estimates
were available.
   The army disputed the report's claim that ``the vast majority''
of soldiers were not punished for wrongdoing. Fogel said soldiers
were court-martialed or disciplined for improper use of force in 25
percent of the fatality cases of children recorded by the army.
   He said army investigations were hampered because Palestinians
often take bodies before autopsies can be performed and Arab
witnesses refuse to cooperate with army investigators.
   The three-volume, 1,008-paged study was written by Anne
Elizabeth Nixon, former deputy director of the American Save the
Children program in Israel. It was funded by a Ford Foundation
grant.
   Joshua Schoffman, an Israeli civil rights lawyer, said the study
had ``serious flaws'' because it relied too heavily on Palestinian
sources.
   ``Just as one has to treat army announcements with skepticism,
you have to treat Palestinian testimony with skepticism and balance
the two,'' he said.
   Among the findings:
   _52 percent of the children killed were not in the vicinity of a
protest when they were fatally injured.
   _Children accounted for 21 percent of all deaths and 38 percent
of all injuries and deaths combined. By AP count, 687 Palestinians
have been killed along with 43 Israelis.
   _The average age of children killed was 10 years.
   _About one in every 15 to 20 children in the occupied lands was
injured, totalling 50,000 to 63,000.

   Rain fell across parts of the Midwest early today, and tornado
watches were in effect over a four-state area in the South.
   Thunderstorms today soaked Louisville, Memphis, and Nashville,
Tenn., and Pittsburgh. Rain also fell in Cleveland, Detroit,
Chicago and Indianapolis.
   More rain was forecast for north and central Texas, where the
release of rain-swollen reservoirs has caused heavy flooding, loss
of life and widespread agricultural damage.
   Flood watches were posted for today over much of New York into
Vermont.
   Skies were fair over much of the lower Eastern Seaboard. Western
skies were patchy with clouds.
   On Wednesday, damaging tornadoes touched down southwest of
Magnolia, Ark., and southeast Worth County in Georgia.
   Torrential rains and winds of up to 50 mph hammered Kentucky
late Wedneday night, battering at least 15 homes at a trailer park
outside Elizabethtown and injuring several residents.
   Flooding continued in parts of Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana.
   Baseball-size hail fell near Fouke, Ark., and hail the size of
golfballs fell at Fairview, W. Va., and Sullivan and Villa Ridge,
Mo.
   The nation's high on Wednesday was 103 degrees at Presidio and
Lajitas, Texas. The low was 16 degrees at Casper, Wyo.

<HEAD>Mexican Police Aided Drug Traffickers, Witness Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexican police accepted payoffs from drug
barons, delivered narcotics and provided arms to protect marijuana
ranches, a prosecution witness said in a trial resulting from a
U.S. drug agent's murder.
   Juan Fernandez testified in U.S. District Court Wednesday that
in 1984 he helped manage marijuana ranches for Mexican drug lord
Rafael Caro Quintero and hnded out bribes to officials from four
Mexican law enforcement agencies.
   Fernandez was the first government witness to testify in the
trial of four men charged with conspiracy in the 1985 torture and
killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
``Kiki'' Camarena.
   The defendants are Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a convicted
Honduran drug kingpin; Ruben Zuno Arce, a brother-in-law of former
Mexican President Luis Echeverria; Juan Bernabe Ramirez, a former
Mexican policeman; and Javier Vasquez Velasco, accused of killing
two U.S. tourists who were mistaken for DEA agents.
   Prosecutors allege that Camarena was killed in retaliation for
raids on marijuana fields that cost Caro Quintero and other drug
barons $5 billion.
   Speaking in Spanish, Fernandez said he had been paid more than
$200,000 as a DEA informant over the past nine years and helped the
agency on ``more than 80 investigations.''
   He said he helped Camarena make an undercover heroin purchase
from a Caro Quintero associate, Manuel Chavez, and that Camarena
had instructed him to take a job helping run the ranches.
   Fernandez said the Guadalajara drug cartel led by Caro Quintero
maintained about 40 marijuana ranches in Zacatecas state. The
cartel employed up to 500 workers who lived in the fields under
armed guard, Fernandez said.
   Chavez used a radio to keep in touch with Mexican federal, state
and local police officials, Fernandez said.
   Chavez would make payoffs ``on a particular day ... the end of
the month,'' Fernandez testified.
   Information obtained by Camarena led to the seizure of more than
10 tons of marijuana during raids on the ranches in May 1985, U.S.
officials contend.
   Testimony at the 1988 trial of three other men in the case
revealed that Camarena was abducted from a Guadalajara street in
February 1985 and taken to a house, where he was tortured and
interrogated, then slain.
   His body was found along with that of his Mexican pilot, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, on a ranch 65 miles outside Guadalajara.
   Former DEA agent James Kuykendall, who was in charge of the
Guadalajara office where Camarena was assigned, testified Wednesday
that U.S. agents used undercover ventures such as Camarena's heroin
buy to convince officials in Washington that ``the problem was
bigger than they believed it was.''

   The Palestine Liberation Organization is
consolidating its military forces throughout the Middle East under
a new strategy to upgrade its combat potential, according to PLO
officials and newspaper reports today.
   The Kuwaiti daily Al-Anbaa quoted PLO leader Yasser Arafat as
saying that Israel was planning a large-scale attack on neighboring
Arab states in autumn or the following spring.
   Arafat warned that Israel intended to occupy the Jordanian
mountains from Salt to Karak on the advice of former Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon, now trade minister, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper quoted Arafat as saying that Sharon recommended
proceeding to the outskirts of Amman, Jordan, ``to impose its
conditions on Jordan.''
   Newspaper reports did not specify that the PLO was gearing up
for war.
   Bassem Abu Sharif, an aide to Arafat, was quoted by Al-Anbaa as
stressing that the military realignment was ``a strategic choice.''
   Al-Anbaa quoted Palestinian sources in Tunis as saying the PLO
leadership recently met in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, and adopted
``a new Palestinian military strategy ... that provides for
gathering all Palestinian forces to enable them to restore their
combat abilities.''
   It said that under the new plan all Palestinian forces have been
shifted to two Arab countries, Iraq and Libya, from Algeria, Sudan,
and the two Yemeni states, where the Palestinian guerrillas fled
from Lebanon.
   The transfer was in line with the tasks to be assigned to these
forces in the coming stage, the newspaper said.
   PLO military strength has usually been scattered in Arab
countries, particularly since 8,000 PLO fighters were forced out of
Beirut by the 1982 Israeli invasion of the Lebanese capital. A year
later, 3,000 more fled the northern Lebanese town of Tripoli under
Syrian pressure.
   Senior PLO figures say they have returned, with the
organization's strength in Lebanon estimated at more than 11,000
fighters.
   Lebanon used to be a favored base for the PLO, which launched
military operations against Israel starting in 1965 from
neighboring Arab countries. Jordan, Egypt and Syria all cracked
down on their operations, leaving only Lebanon.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Conservative Public Holding Back Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that a
conservative Soviet public afraid of change is holding back his
efforts at economic and political reform.
   ``Changing people's minds is the most difficult thing.
Perestroika depends on public opinion, and it's conservative,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev previously has blamed bureaucrats for bogging down
perestroika, his program of restructuring Soviet society. This is
the first time he has said the people might be at fault.
   ``In politics, the public doesn't accept pluralism, and it has
complexes about ideological conceptions and cliches,'' Gorbachev
told a crowd of reporters in a break at the Russian congress.
   Many hard-liners are unhappy with Gorbachev's recent moves to
end the Communist Party's monopoly on power, legalize private
ownership of factories and otherwise upset basic laws of Marxism.
   ``In economics, they say you must not touch this and you must
not touch that,'' Gorbachev said.
   Turning to Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, who gave a television
interview last week on economic reform proposals, Gorbachev
commented: ``Ryzhkov only said a few words and already there is
great agitation in the country.''
   ``Take any sphere, everywhere we are hindered by complexes,''
the Soviet leader said.
   Faced with public alarm, Gorbachev has repeatedly delayed a
radical economic reform plan over the last two months.
   He backed off suggestions by his aides that he was planning
Polish-style ``shock therapy,'' which brought sudden price rises
and mass unemployment in that country, in hope of shortening the
difficult period of transition from old-style Communism to a market
economy.
   Instead, Gorbachev has promised the public that nothing would be
decided without discussion. He also indicated that his presentation
of the program to the national parliament will be delayed again, as
he will not discuss it with his own Presidential Council of
advisors until May 22.
   Gorbachev also used the brief encounter with reporters to
reassure the Soviet populace that the country can handle the
current intense political struggle and its economic crisis, which
has left stores near empty.
   ``People are saying `Chaos, chaos, collapse, collapse.' When
Lenin watched a similar revolutionary process, he said: `You know,
this chaos will crystallize a new form of life.''
   The Soviet leader was looking relaxed and healthy after a day
and a half of watching the Congress of the Russian republic wrangle
over its agenda. Newly elected radicals are trying to elect a
Gorbachev rival, Boris Yeltsin, as president of Russia, and to
wrest control of the republic's affairs away from the national
government. Russia is the largest of 15 republics in the Soviet
Union, with 52 percent of its people and three-quarters of its land
mass.
   Gorbachev, who stands to lose considerable prestige if his
candidate, Russian premier Alexander Vlasov, is defeated by
Yeltsin, was off-hand when asked about the struggle.
   ``I see no drama in this,'' he said. ``This is all normal. The
(Communist) party has given up its monopoly.''
   ``Tomorrow or the next day, new parties will appear with their
own platforms and proposals, and this will be a normal process.''
   He also condemned the Soviet tradition of government-owned
monopolies, which have been blamed for part of the nation's
economic stagnation.
   He even joked about it.
   ``We fought against the capitalist monopoly for 70 years _ but
the strongest monopoly is our own,'' he said. ``Right here we have
the representative of our former monopoly, Uralmash,'' he said,
gesturing at Ryzhkov. The premier previously served as director of
the giant Uralmash factory, which makes earthmovers and other
heavy-duty equipment.
   But when foreign correspondents pressed him on the crisis in the
Baltics, where Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all demanding
independence from the Soviet Union, he abruptly shut down the
interview.
   Asked if he would meet with representatives of the Baltic, he
looked the correspondent in the eye _ and then turned away, telling
his guards, ``Let's move on.''
   Another correspondent then asked if he would meet with
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who was en route to
Moscow this afternoon with a compromise proposal to put to
Gorbachev. He said, ``I have received no such request,'' and moved
away.

<HEAD>Polhill Undergoing Cancer Surgery</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 4 grafs Polhill in surgery; picks up 4th graf pvs,
He said...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freed American hostage Robert Polhill
underwent surgery today to remove his voice box because of a
cancerous growth around his vocal cords.
   Ben Smith, spokesman for Walter Reed Medical Center, said the
midmorning operation was expected to take about four hours.
   Polhill's doctors said Wednesday that such radical surgery might
have been avoided if the tumor had been diagnosed sooner.
   ``If it had been discovered earlier, he probably wouldn't have
to lose his voice box, provided he had the right radiation
therapy,'' said Col. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy commander of clinical
services at the Army hospital.
   He said the tumor is probably at least a year old, but that
there is no evidence the cancer has spread. Nonetheless, Polhill's
treatment will include radiation therapy, the doctor said.
   Polhill, 55, was held captive by Shiite Moslems in Lebanon for
39 months before being released April 22.
   ``We are going to overcome this ordeal. We are survivors, and we
are definitely going to survive this ordeal,'' Ferial Polhill said
at the news conference, which her husband did not attend.
   Polhill has told his doctors he was visited by physicians eight
or 10 times during his captivity.
   ``I'm pretty sure they didn't examine his throat,'' Zajtchuk
said.
   ``He's a smoker and this condition is related to smoking,''
Zajtchuk said, adding that Polhill told him his captors had kept
him in cigarettes.
   ``The growth is involving both vocal cords. One vocal cord, the
left, is paralyzed,'' Zajtchuk said. ``The tumor also extends below
the vocal cords, so it is quite an extensive lesion.''
   Polhill's weak, raspy voice prompted early discovery of the
tumor. A full diagnosis was put off until Polhill, a diabetic who
was 25 pounds underweight when he was released, gained enough
stamina to undergo the general anesthesia necessary for a biopsy.
   Polhill was told after the biopsy last week that the growth was
cancerous, and agreed to surgery. Public disclosure was postponed
to give Polhill time to tell members of his family, Zajtchuk said.
   Mrs. Polhill said her husband's spirits were ``very high, very
positive, strong.'' Polhill's mother, Ruth, nodded agreement.
   Zajtchuk said Polhill had begun working with a speech therapist
to explore various methods for voice communication once the larynx
is removed.
   One common method involves the use of an electronic device that
emulates the voice box. Another technique involves swallowing air
and regurgitating it in a way that forms words.
   A third possibility, one not favored for radiation patients,
requires a tracheotomy _ the insertion of a breathing tube in the
throat.
   ``His mental status is remarkable,'' Zajtchuk said. ``Imagine a
fellow being locked up for 3{ years. And then he comes to Walter
Reed, and he virtually gets locked up again. And then he can't
communicate, because he's going to lose his voice box.''
   Polhill is expected to spend about two weeks in the hospital
after the surgery, then will undergo radiation treatments.

<HEAD>Company Chairman Bought Van Gogh Painting, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today identified the buyer of van
Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' as the honorary chairman of a
major Japanese paper company and quoted him as saying he spent $33
million more than he intended.
   ``I am extremely pleased with the purchase,'' the 74-year-old
businessman, Ryoei Saito, told Nihon Keizai, an economic newspaper.
   A representative of the Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo paid $82.5
million for the world's most expensive painting at a Christie's
auction in New York on Tuesday, but refused to identify its client.
   Nihon Keizai said Saito, president of Daishowa Paper from 1961
to 1982, was the anonymous buyer. Saito and officials of Daishowa
Paper Manufacturing Co., Japan's second largest paper manufacturer,
could not be reached for comment.
   Saito was quoted by the paper as saying,``I have been collecting
paintings for 40 years, but I wanted to own this van Gogh painting.
Therefore, I asked to make a successful bid no matter how expensive
it was.''
   The final price of the painting ``was 5 billion yen ($33
million) higher than what I expected,'' he was quoted as saying.
Saito told the paper he borrowed the money from banks, using his
property as security, the paper said.
   Asked about the possibility of displaying the painting, Saito
said that for security reasons he would ``keep it at hand for the
time being.''
   He said eventually he would like to display the van Gogh at the
Shizuoka Prefectural Art Museum.

<TEXT>
   The four major television networks say they
will keep boycotting some White House events if President Bush's
press secretary continues limiting the number of cameras.
   The networks bypassed two of Bush's meetings Wednesday to
protest Marlin Fitzwater's experiment with limiting coverage of
certain events to two pool cameras.
   CBS News bureau chief Barbara Cohen, who chairs the networks'
own pool of bureau chiefs, said, ``We have all decided that if they
continue to call for a travel pool for these events, we will
continue to not come.''
   She and the bureau chiefs at NBC, ABC and CNN were demanding a
meeting with Fitzwater to discuss the coverage rules.
   The White House did not attempt to limit the number of cameras
at any of today's events, including Bush's planned Oval Office
meeting with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Radio networks, in a gesture of sympathy, also declined to send
in a reporter to cover two Bush meetings Wednesday dealing with
civil rights.
   ``They don't have to cover us if they don't want to,'' Fitzwater
said in an interview. ``All we're doing is experimenting.''
   Fitzwater said he wanted to reduce the crush of camera crews
inside the Oval Office and other corners of the executive mansion
at limited coverage events.
   All the networks covered the president's news conference on
Wednesday.
   The White House earlier in the week twice limited coverage of
presidential meetings, including the opening of Tuesday's budget
summit with congressional leaders. A single network sent in two
cameras to videotape the events and shared the tape afterward with
competitors.
   ``It's not our fault that there are more independents sending
camera crews in,'' said Cohen. ``We are competitors and we don't
want to have our product homogenized by having one camera crew at
all these events.''
   ABC bureau chief George Watson said, ``If it's a question of
congestion and decorum, that's something we can talk about.''
   He said the networks might be open to restricting coverage to
two cameras, in exchange for letting each network send in its own
correspondent to ask questions. Currently only one broadcast
correspondent is in such pool coverage.

   The son of actor Marlon Brando was arrested
for investigation of murder in the shooting of a guest at the
exclusive Bel-Air estate of his Oscar-winning father, police said
today.
   Christian Brando, 32, is being held without bail, Lt. Ron Hall
said.
   Officers called to the estate late Wednesday night found the
body of Dag Dorlett, 26, who had been shot once in the head, said
Officer Bill Frio.
   ``The dispute was over the victim's treatment of Cheyenne
Brando, Marlon Brando's 20-year-old daughter,'' Hall said. ``It was
a family matter.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Marlon Brando, his wife and daughter were in another wing of the
home and did not witness the shooting, Hall said.
   Officers recovered a handgun they said may have been used in the
shooting and also seized four rifles from the home, Hall said.
   Christian is the son of the 66-year-old actor and his first
wife, Anna Kashfi. The couple was divorced in 1959. Cheyenne is
Brando's daughter by Tarita Teriipia, a Tahitian actress who played
his sweetheart in 1962's ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
   Marlon Brando won best actor Oscars in 1954 for ``On the
Waterfront'' and in 1972 for ``The Godfather.''

   Five lawyers suing a county judge in
federal court argue that his practice of opening sessions with a
prayer forces his religious beliefs on a captive audience.
   For a year, Mecklenburg County District Judge Bill Constangy has
recited a 67-word prayer he composed himself before he hears
traffic and other lower court cases.
   ``A lot of people think the courts are involved in a lot of
tricks and games,'' Constangy testified Wednesday. ``The prayer ...
sets the proper tone... . It's not done as a religious exercise,
it's done for a secular purpose.''
   The North Carolina Civil Liberties Union and five Charlotte
lawyers are suing to bar the prayer under the U.S. Constitution's
separation of church and state.
   ``This is an official prayer,'' said George Daly, attorney for
the plaintiffs. ``It was composed by an official, read in an
official setting, on company time.''
   After hearing several hours of testimony, U.S. District Court
Judge James McMillan said he would not rule before June 4. He gave
attorneys on both sides until then to submit additional evidence.
   Constangy, a 47-year-old Charlotte native who attends a Roman
Catholic church, was defended by the state attorney general's
office, as well as attorneys from a Greensboro law firm and The
Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville, Va.
   The institute is a non-profit legal and educational organization
that specializes in litigation involving church-and-state
constitutional issues, according to its executive director, Michael
Patrick.
   One of the judge's attorneys, James T. Williams Jr., compared
the prayer with those invoked before Congress and the inscription
``In God We Trust'' on U.S. currency.
   ``There's no difference on earth between the U.S. Congress
opening its sessions with a prayer and this man opening court with
a prayer,'' Williams said.
   But public defender Kathleen Arundell doesn't see it that way.
   ``The judge should avoid the appearance of impropriety,'' she
testified. ``The people in the courtroom feel he has made a
religious statement and he isn't impartial.''
   Constangy recites this prayer: ``O Lord, our God, our Father in
heaven, we pray this morning that you will place your divine
guiding hand on this courtroom and that with your mighty
outstretched arm you will protect the innocent, give justice to
those who have been harmed and mercy to us all.
   ``Let truth be heard and wisdom be reflected in the light of
your presence here with us today. Amen.''

<TEXT>
   ST-AMABLE, Quebec (AP) _ A fire raged out of control in Quebec's
largest tire dump today, spewing coal-black smoke, and the mayor of
a nearby town said residents might have to be evacuated.
   The flames jumped a firebreak late Wednesday and quickly spread
to almost all 3 million tires in the dump, which is the size of
seven football fields.
   Officials said it was not immediately clear what caused the
blaze, located about 1 mile outside St-Amable, a town of 5,000
people, and about 50 miles from the U.S. border. Billowing clouds
of smoke drifted over nearby farm fields.
   The smoke funneled high and drifted northwest, away from
St-Amable, where citizens for years have asked that the tires be
moved or at least better protected.
   But officials said a change in winds could blow smoke toward the
town today. They told residents that, while tests for toxic
elements in the air so far turned up negative, an evacuation plan
was ready.
   ``We are going to watch the toxicity of air and if it goes high
we will evacuate,'' said Jacques Doyon, the mayor of St-Amable.
   The smoke was clearly visible over Montreal, 13 miles away.
   The fire, which began Wednesday afternoon, jumped a firebreak
and raced to the end of the dump, where firefighters from a half
dozen towns in the region held the flames at a 50-yard trench dug
with heavy equipment.
   Doyon on Wednesday said fire crews were ``powerless'' to fight
the blaze until the flames became less intense.
   Early today, a steady rain began to fall on the blazing tires.
Doyon said fire crews started dumping dirt on the lower end of the
tire pile in an attempt to snuff the flames.
   Smoke from burning tires is known to pose a health danger and
can spoil crops. The burning tires also leave an oily residue that
can contaminate underground and surface water.
   Last month, a fire at a dump in Ste-Anne-des-Plaines, 35 miles
north of Montreal, was brought under control after 50,000 tires
burned over 24 hours.
   Hagersville made headlines in February when arsonists started a
fire at a dump holding 14 million tires. The fire, which burned for
17 days, was the largest tire blaze in North American history.
   The Quebec government said in March it would spend $3.5 million
to increase security and put up fences at the province's seven
largest tire dump sites.

<TEXT>
   Muppet creator Jim Henson was killed by an unusually
quick-spreading form of bacterial pneumonia, a doctor who treated
him said.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, director of intensive care at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York, said the 53-year-old
puppeteer apparently was healthy until coming down with flulike
symptoms Friday.
   Henson was examined by a doctor in North Carolina who did not
find pneumonia, Gelmont said. Henson's condition worsened and he
returned on Monday to New York, where he died Wednesday.
   When he arrived at the hospital early Tuesday, the bacterial
infection that caused his pneumonia had spread from his lungs
through his body, attacking other organs, doctors said. At that
point, it could not be controlled with antibiotics, the usual
therapy.
   Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs that is most often
caused by streptococcus, the bacteria that killed Henson, but also
can be caused by other forms of bacteria, as well as viruses.
   Pneumonia strikes about 2 million Americans each year and kills
40,000 to 70,000, many already ill with other serious diseases,
such as heart disease or cancer. Pneumonia is primarily a hazard of
the very young and very old and rarely kills people who are in
otherwise good health.
   Among those at especially high risk of pneumonia's complications
are people whose immune systems have been weakened by diseases such
as AIDS or who are taking immune-suppressing medicines. As for
Henson, Gelmont said, ``Categorically, he did not have AIDS.''

<TEXT>
   Juan Bosch, a leftist
ex-president once ousted in a military coup, took an early lead
over conservative President Joaquin Balaguer in Dominican
elections, according to initial returns today.
   Bosch, who has moderated his positions in promising to lead the
nation out of an economic crisis, held a narrow lead with about 20
percent of the polling stations reporting, the Electoral Board said
this morning.
   At the headquarters of Bosch's Dominican Liberation Party,
Bosch's backers were celebrating early today.
   Lideo Cadet, the party's secretary-general, excitedly told
reporters at dawn: ``We've won the elections.'' But he was not
authorized to make a formal claim of victory on Bosch's behalf.
   Cadet said Bosch was being kept informed about Wednesday's
election by the party leadership but would not comment yet.
   Neither Balaguer nor his party leaders commented publicly on the
returns. Aides said Balaguer planned to keep to his usual schedule
at his palace office.
   Vote-counting was being done by hand and was running far behind
schedule.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind from glaucoma, and Bosch, 80, were locked
in their fifth contest for the leadership of this Caribbean nation
of 7 million people.
   With 1,364 of the 6,663 polling stations reporting, Bosch had
126,443 votes to Balaguer's 114,806, election officials said. A
former socialist mayor of Santo Domingo, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez,
was third with 80,816 votes, and center-left candidate Jacobo
Majluta had 22,559 votes, officials said.
   Bosch and the army hierarchy have been at odds since he was
overthrown in a military coup 27 years ago. But military officers
and Balaguer stated before the elections they would respect the
outcome of the vote.
   About 30 international observers monitored the voting, including
former President Jimmy Carter. He told reporters that talks with
the four major candidates after the polls closed had convinced him
the final results would be respected by all.
   Santo Domingo was quiet this morning, with no military patrols
visible. Public and private offices and commercial establishments
customariliy remain closed and Dominicans stay home from work the
day after national elections, although it is not an official
holiday.
   The Election Board remained in control of the nation's public
and private radio and television stations, allowing only the
broadcast of official election information.
   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote, but the
officials did not announce the turnout or say what percentage of
the vote had been counted.
   Bosch, an author and intellectual who describes himself as a
Marxist but not a Communist, ran on a moderate platform. He pledged
to work for good relations with the United States and endorsed
capitalism as the best way to improve his country's economic plight.
   Balaguer, founder and leader of the Social Christian Reformist
Party, pinned his hopes largely on a $2 billion public-works
project to transform centuries-old Santo Domingo. He portrayed
Bosch as a dangerous Marxist.
   Balaguer's public-works project has created thousands of new
jobs, but his popularity has slumped as the country's economic
problems deepened. Dominicans have contended with chronic
electricity blackouts and water shortages.
   Bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points, but some

<HEAD>Judge: Open Stores, But Don't Sell Banned Items</HEAD>

   A judge has ruled that all businesses can
open on Sundays in North Dakota, but has retained a list of 44
items that still cannot be sold on the Sabbath, including clothing
and hardware.
   The law, which also lists 37 types of businesses that may open
Sundays, including cold storage warehouses, libraries, bait shops
and coin-operated laundries, was called ``arbitrary, haphazard and
irrational'' by the judge.
   North Dakota malls, though, won't be opening for business Sunday.
   South Central District Judge Gerald Glaser temporarily blocked
his own ruling from taking effect, anticipating an appeal that
Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth later said he would pursue.
   The decision came Wednesday in a lawsuit filed by a group of
North Dakota businesses seeking to overturn the state's Sunday
closing law, which is recognized as the nation's strictest.
   The businesses, backed by the state chamber of commerce, contend
the law is vague, unconstitutional and selectively enforced.
   Glaser's decision, which handed small victories to both Spaeth
and North Dakota shopkeepers in the dispute, surprised the attorney
general.
   Glaser ``has staked out a middle ground, and I don't think
either side expected it,'' Spaeth said Wednesday.
   Glaser said the law was discriminatory, as well as ``arbitrary,
haphazard and irrational.''
   But its flaws did not warrant throwing it out entirely, the
judge said.
   Glaser's ruling, in essence, does away with the list of
businesses that may open, allowing any retailer to open on Sunday
as long as the retailer does not sell the 44 prohibited items.
   John Olson, a Bismarck attorney for the business group, said the
ruling ``further erodes Sunday closing restrictions in North
Dakota. There's no doubt about that.''
   ``It will probably increase retail business on Sunday,'' Olson
said. ``But the opinion does not have the effect of going the whole
nine yards and creating Sunday opening in this state.''
   A large discount retailer could open on Sunday if it limited
itself to selling shampoo, toothpaste and other items not
specifically barred from Sunday sale.
   However, the store could not sell clothing _ except for work
gloves and baby supplies _ or kitchenware, radios, clocks or linens.
   In Fargo, merchants at North Dakots's largest shopping mall said
they were disappointed and somewhat confused.
   ``I wasn't expecting to completely do away with the law, but I
was hoping we'd take a bigger bite out of it,'' said Mark Sinner,
owner of Creative Kitchen in the West Acres Mall.
   Creative Kitchen sells kitchenware and kitchen utensils _ two of
the 44 items barred for Sunday sale.
   ``I think it's idiotic,'' said Donna Haroldson of Fargo, who was
shopping with a friend. ``I guess North Dakota always feels Sunday
is a day of rest. I think that's dumb in this day and age.''

<HEAD>Train Workers Stop Rail Traffic Nationwide in Warning Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German transportation workers briefly
halted train traffic nationwide today to demand higher wages and
job protection, the latest strikes in a wave of worker unrest.
   The 30-minute strikes paralyzed main rail routes. Employees
stopped work at switching yards, train stations and ticket offices,
the East German government news service ADN said.
   Workers staged the warning strikes to protest what they called
the failure of transportation officials and the government railroad
company to meet their demands.
   Train traffic, a principal form of daily transportation for many
East Germans, was interrupted in the cities of Magdeburg, Rostock,
Gera, Schwerin and others, ADN said.
   At the main station in Rostock, workers demonstrated against
``the delay tactics of the traffic ministry,'' ADN said.
   Transportation and railroad officials rejected a wage demand on
Wednesday, the news service said.
   The strikes were the latest among several worker demonstrations
in recent weeks as frustration grows over the possible effects on
jobs of unification with West Germany.
   The two nations are to combine their economies on July 2, when
the West German mark is to become the currency of East Germany.
   Workers are seeking protection from joblessness and from the
better-made Western imports already flooding the country. Many
outmoded East German businesses are expected to fail in the first
two years of economic unification.
   They also are demanding higher wages to cope with the price
increases expected when Communist price controls are lifted and
costs are set by the free market.
   The strikes were held during the weekly session of Parliament,
which debated the draft of a constitution that will allow East
Germany to unite with its western neighbor.
   The draft of the democratic charter would eliminate the
guarantees of full unemployment under the old Socialist system,
toppled by a peaceful revolt last year.
   Left-leaning Social Democrats say East Germans should have some
job and social guarantees during a transition period to the free
market.
   Conservatives say the increase in Western investment will
eventually raise living standards and provide jobs.

<HEAD>``Today'' Still Second</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Today'' show, which will welcome Joe
Garagiola back in June as its third co-host, still has the ratings
blues. It was in second place last week for the 19th straight week,
Nielsen estimates showed Thursday.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' remained first in ratings,
averaging a 4.8. ``Today'' averaged a 3.2 and ``CBS This Morning''
a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   The 19th week of bad news for ``Today'' came a day after it was
twitted on local TV by WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York'' show, which
last week beat the slumping NBC show in local Nielsen ratings.
   The needling occurred Wednesday on the East River, where
``Today'' was broadcasting live from a 160-foot luxury yacht.
   Gordon Elliott, who normally barges into homes for live
interviews on ``Good Day,'' dogged the ``Today'' broadcast in a
rented cabin cruiser.
   NBC was not amused, said the puckish Elliott, whom viewers saw
using a bullhorn to hail NBC's show, ask permission to board what
he called the ``S.S. Today,'' and interview co-hosts Bryant Gumbel
and Deborah Norville.
   NBC, though the Coast Guard, ``formally asked us to stay 100
yards from their vessel, which I thought was bad sportsmanship,''
he groused. ``I was going to make our show available to help them
in the ratings.''
   But Elliott can sympathize with ratings woes like those of
``Today.'' He once was a host of ``Good Morning Australia,'' which
at one time also had ratings problems. ``It happens to every
show,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Predicts Cooling Of Iranian Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
today predicted a cooling of the radical revolution that swept Iran
more than 11 years ago, and said his people will care more about
the economy, Tehran radio reported.
   ``As the revolutionary conditions of the country are normalized,
society's political sensitivity will decrease, and attraction to
welfare and material issues will increase,'' he said, according to
the radio monitored in Cyprus.
   Speaking to provincial officials in Tehran, he told them to
``move according to the conditions of the time and create an
economic-political balance in society in accordance with the
government's precise programs.''
   Rafsanjani is trying to pull Iran out of the economic mess left
by the chaotic 1979 revolution and a devastating eight-year war
with Iraq. Sources in Tehran report growing public dissatisfaction
with the economy.
   Iranians daily must contend with shortages of almost all
consumer goods, runaway inflation and an artificially inflated
currency that is all but worthless abroad.
   Since his election in July, Rafsanjani has tried to repair
Iran's pariah international image by tempering the revolutionary
hostility toward the West, from where he hopes to attract
investment and advanced technology.
   As a result, he has been under attack by a rival anti-Western
radical camp, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
and Ahmad Khomeini, son of the late revolutionary patriarch,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The radicals fear relations with the West would compromise the
``neither East nor West'' principle laid down by Khomeini to
preserve Iran's neutrality vis-a-vis the superpowers, and spell the
end of the revolution.
   Ahmad, who holds no official position in the government but
wields considerable influence as the late Khomeini's only surviving
son, on Wednesday urged the government to clarify its policy toward
the West.
   He referred to the ``existence of two trends of thought in the
country,'' and said this ``confused the population.''
   In an apparent attack on Rafsanjani's administration for what
the radicals see as compromises with the West, Khomeini said: ``The
point of compromise or no compromise must be defined.''
   Rafsanjani's rivals have accused him of giving in to the West by
gaining the release of two American hostages last month from their
pro-Iranian captors. They also are unhappy that Iran settled a
financial dispute in which Americans who lost property in Iran
after the revolution would be compensated.
   Ninety liberal Iranians, who were instrumental in the revolution
that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and paved the way for the
Islamic republic, have reportedly written to Rafsanjani demanding
the restoration of constitutional rights and condemning the
government for trampling civil liberties.
   The letter, signed among others by Mehdi Bazargan, the
now-estranged leader who became the Islamic Republic's first prime
minister in 1979, reportedly has accused the government of
mismanaging the economy and isolating Iran internationally.
   The letter was obtained by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London.
   ``What you have produced for the poor are slogans and empty
stomachs,'' the letter said.
   Without referring to the letter, Rafsanjani said today that
``the liberals'' and other groups opposing the government were
``politically bankrupt.''

<TEXT>
   A Boston man talking on the telephone with
his 18-year-old daughter in Santa Fe listened helplessly while she
struggled with a rapist, a prosecutor said.
   ``The telephone was off the hook and the victim's father could
hear her screams,'' Assistant District Attorney Jim Hall said
during a bail hearing Wednesday.
   Neighbors also heard the victim's screams and called police, who
arrested Andrew Sisneros, 27, of Santa Fe.
   Sisneros was indicted by a Santa Fe County grand jury Monday on
two counts of rape and one count of kidnapping in the May 7 attack.
   Hall urged District Judge Joe Castellano to maintain Sisneros'
bail at $250,000 because of the seriousness of the crime and
because he might be indicted on similar charges in another case.
   Castellano raised Sisneros' bail to $300,000.
   Sisneros allegedly followed the woman inside her apartment,
locked the door, turned up the music and attacked the woman, Hall
said.
   The father, whose name was withheld to protect the identity of
the victim, could not hang up and call authorities because his
daughter's telephone was off the hook.

   Unidentified attackers threw a hand

   Residents in the area said they heard a loud explosion at 2:30

   Police said they had no immediate clues on the identity of the

<TEXT>
   Most of the charges of a state tax evasion
indictment against self-styled hotel queen Leona Helmsley were
dropped today.
   State Supreme Court Justice John Bradley said he was dropping
180 of 188 counts on grounds of double jeopardy.
   The dropped charges, he said, are essentially the same as those
on which Mrs. Helmsley was tried and convicted in federal court
last August.
   She was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1
million. She is appealing the conviction and sentence.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Mrs. Helmsley said tearfully as she left
court after hearing Bradley's ruling.
   The eight charges that remain are offering a false instrument
for filing, a felony. Each is punishable by up to four years in
prison.
   Leslie Gersing, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's
office, said one of the eight charges relate to Mrs. Helmsley's
personal taxes and the others involve Helmsley businesses.
   Gersing said prosecutors were studying the decision and had not
decided whether to appeal.

   Rain-swollen Lake Livingston has released
enough water in the last three weeks to fill the Astrodome 1,200
times, and thousands of acres downstream could be flooded until
September, officials said.
   But there was some good news. Thunderstorms that dumped 2{
inches of rain west of Houston dispersed before hitting the area
northeast of Houston where the rain-swollen Trinity River has
swamped several subdivisions.
   ``It looks like Liberty County escapes this line of
thunderstorms today,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Scott
Kiser said.
   With about 100,000 cubic feet of water being released each
second from Lake Livingston Dam, however, ``we're more concerned
about the water down here right now,'' said county dispatcher Lin
Pruitt.
   Elsewhere, heavy rain caused flooding that drove residents from
their apartments in two housing projects in East St. Louis, Ill.,
along the Mississippi River. Fifteen families' homes were flooded
in Danville, in northeastern Illinois.
   Prison officials evacuated 270 women Wednesday night from the
Renz Correctional Center on the rising Missouri River near
Jefferson City, Mo. They were taken to two nearby prisons.
   The Mississippi was expected to hit flood-stage at St. Louis
this weekend.
   Meanwhile, the Red River pushed deeper into central Louisiana
today, threatening 700,000 acres of prime cropland. One farmer
began the delicate process of moving his 4,000-head alligator herd,
threatened with submersion in the rising waters of a bayou.
   At least 360 people in Louisiana have been forced from their
homes.
   Flooding in recent weeks has killed 13 people in Texas and one
in Oklahoma.
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon dispatched a helicopter and three
National Guardsmen to southeastern Oklahoma today to help get feed
to more than 200 stranded head of cattle.
   About 7,000 people on about 200 square miles downstream of Lake
Livingston have been advised to evacuate, but only about two dozen
people had gone to shelters by this morning.
   ``They're being stubborn,'' said emergency volunteer Frances
Thornton. ``They're afraid of looting and they don't want to leave
their homes.''
   Others may have sought refuge with friends. The subdivisions
downstream are scattered in the woods, making it difficult to know
how many people have left.
   The dam will be releasing 100,000 cubic feet per second for at
least the next week, and at least 50,000 feet per second through
June, said Sam Scott, executive service manager for the Trinity
River Authority.
   Between April 27 and Wednesday, the dam had released about 556
billion gallons of water, enough to fill the Astrodome 1,200 times.
The previous record flow is 75,000 cubic feet per second, in 1973,
Scott said. The dam was built in 1969.
   Just 20,000 feet per second is enough to cause flooding, ``and
we could be releasing that amount into September,'' Scott said.
That's assuming minimal rain.
   ``If we got 5 or 8 inches it could be catastrophic, depending on
how fast it fell and where it fell,'' Scott said.
   The Red River crested Tuesday evening at Shreveport, Louisiana's
second biggest city, and was expected to crest Sunday at
Alexandria. A giant levee system should protect the central
Louisiana city, officials said.
   After flying by helicopter from Alexandria northwest to
Shreveport, a distance of 127 miles, Gov. Buddy Roemer said he
would ask for federal aid.
   Bayous and other tributaries were backing up, and farmers in the
Natchitoches area, midway between Shreveport and Alexandria, were
building makeshift levees to protect homes and recently planted
corn, milo, wheat and soybeans.
   Skeet Rogers parked four farm wagons on a mound and prepared to
move his 4,000 alligators there from their pens. His men will wear
chain-mail gloves to move the gators, which are raised for their
meat and skins, he said.
   ``The last time we got to fooling with them, one man got 47
stitches,'' he said. ``We can't get behind them with horses and
drive them to high ground.''

   The adult daughters of a child abuse expert were
awarded $1.2 million each from a jury that found the former FBI
agent and prosecutor had sexually abused and beaten them when they
were growing up.
   Susan Hammond, 44, and her sister, Sharon Simone, 45, called
their lawsuit ``a terrible act of love'' to make Edward Rodgers,
72, accountable for years of abuse.
   ``I feel really good that I've gone public with this,'' Hammond
said after the verdict Wednesday.
   ``My father did shameful and horrible things to me and my
brothers and sisters. I don't believe he is a shameful and horrible
man, but he has to be held accountable.''
   The women sued their father, a former FBI agent, chief
investigator for the El Paso County, Colo., District Attorney's
office and a nationally known child abuse expert, for abuses
suffered from 1944 through 1965.
   Rodgers cannot be criminally charged because the statute of
limitations in Colorado for sexual assault on children is 10 years.
The limit for a civil lawsuit is two years, but jurors determined
that the sisters became aware of the nature and extent of their
injury only within the past two years, during therapy.
   Neither Rodgers nor his attorney was present during the trial,
and the proceedings were conducted by the sisters' female lawyers
before an all-female jury picked by the women's attorneys.
   In a deposition, Rodgers admitted that he hit his wife and may
have hit his children, but said he didn't remember doing so. He
said he had fought alcoholism for years.
   He described himself as a domineering person ``who demanded
strict obedience from my children.'' ``I'm sure that I was harsh
with them, but I don't know that it rose to the level of criminal
abuse,'' he said.
   The lawsuit deeply divided the Rodgers family. Two other
daughters testified on their sisters' behalf, but their three
brothers questioned the degree of abuse suffered by their sisters.
   Rodgers recently fired his attorney, Thomas D. Gresham, who said
this week that he has been unable to locate his client since April
24.
   The jury awarded each sister $600,000 for economic and
non-economic damages and $600,000 for punitive damages. Simone, of
Boston, and Hammond, of Southern California, say they are unable to
have intimate sexual relationships with their husbands.
   The other sisters did not take part in the lawsuit.
   Hammond testified that her mother sent her to a Catholic school
because she feared Rodgers might kill her and that Rodgers raped
her when she returned home from the school at age 19.
   Simone testified that she was often spared beatings because she
made a constant effort to please him.

<TEXT>
   Pro-Sandinista strikers ended a
walkout today that had crippled the new pro-American government,
but the country's cash crisis deepened while Washington officials
haggled over an aid package.
   Under the settlement signed Wednesday night, public employees'
salaries are doubled and the government promises not to fire those
who walked off the job.
   Government buildings occupied for a week were vacated by morning
and the country's estimated 150,000 government employees employees
were returning to work normally. The bus system was returning to
normal, but slowly, and long lines formed at bus stops.
   The international airport, closed since Tuesday, reopened.
   The agreement was a victory for the Sandinista unions, which
virtually shut down Managua and much of this Central American
nation of 3.5 million residents since the walkout began Friday.
   It was also a victory for the leftist Sandinista Front, which
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's 3-week-old government
accused of a behind-the-scenes role in the strike.
   ``We hope this experience will serve the government of Senora
Violeta to think over our demands,'' labor leader Lucio Jimenez
told a news conference.
   ``The main achievement (of the strike) is that the government
will be able to do nothing without the active participation of the
workers.''
   The government, which had declared the strike illegal Monday and
threatened massive firings, backed off on practically all points in
contention.
   Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga said the strike, which
had been stepped up daily since May 10, cost the government $10
million in lost production and revenues.
   That is a loss Nicaragua's battered economy could hardly
withstand, especially after President Bush on Wednesday said he
could not legally provide $40 million in emergency aid Mrs.
Chamorro requested.
   Bush also complained that ``procedural gridlock'' in Congress
was holding up a $300 million Nicaraguan aid plan. For years,
Congress funded the Contras rebels in their war with the ruling
Sandinistas and much of the nation's economic woes stem from the
fihgting.
   Mayorga said the government budget had planned for eventual
raises similar to those granted, but that because of the strike
they had to be granted sooner than planned.
   He said his government is counting on the generosity of the
Conference of Donors, a group of industrialized, mostly European
nations, who help Third-World countries. The group is to meet in
Rome June 6-7, where Nicaragua will present a case for aid.
   Nicaraguan officials say they inherited an economy ravaged by
years of Sandinista rule and U.S. economic sanctions, with only $3
million left in the treasury and an $11 billion foreign debt.
   The striking workers initially demanded a 200 percent pay raise
to keep up with inflation, which is galloping along at an estimated
70 percent a month. But they settled for 100 percent after the
government offered 120 percent.
   ``We did not want to be responsible for hyperinflation,''
Jimenez said when asked about accepting the lower percentage.
   Mayorga said the labor unrest represented ``the loss of two
valuable weeks'' in moving Nicaragua toward a free-market economy
and trying to turn it around. Mayorga has devaluated the cordoba,
Nicaragua's currency, twice in the last three weeks, something that
has sent prices for staples soaring.
   Nicaraguan public workers earn as little as $10 a month, and
salaries of $30-$40 are very common. A secretary can earn $70 a
month; a technician $140; a middle-level bank administrator $350.
Salaries more than $500 a month in the public sector are rare.

   President Chaim Herzog today granted Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir a 21-day extension on his mandate to form a
new government.
   Shamir had asked for extra time because of disputes with
potential partners over the distribution of Cabinet posts, Avi
Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, said today. The previous mandate
expires on Friday.
   ``Shamir came to the president and asked for 21 days. He got 21
days,'' said Herzog's spokesman, Giora Pordes.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, has tentative
agreements that would give him a majority in parliament. But he has
been unable to sign pacts with three ultra-right parties and three
Orthodox religious factions.
   ``The problem is who gets what, '' Cabinet post, Pazner said.
   Pazner said the prime minister was optimistic he would be able
to present a government to the 120-member Knesset, or parliament,
by next week.
   Under Israeli law, a legislator entrusted by the president with
forming a government is initially given three weeks, and then may
ask for an additional three weeks. No president has ever rejected a
request for an extension.
   Israel has been governed by Shamir's 13-member transition
Cabinet since March 15, when the left-leaning Labor Party toppled
the Likud-Labor coalition because Shamir refused to accept U.S.
proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo.
   Herzog first asked Shimon Peres of the center-left Labor Party
to try to form a government. But Peres failed after five weeks and
was forced to hand the mandate to Shamir on April 26.
   At the time, Likud signed a coalition agreement with a
four-member faction headed by Yitzhak Modai, a former finance
minister. The faction had vacillated between the two rival camps
for weeks.
   A second agreement was signed with Eliezer Mizrahi, a defector
from the Agudat Israel ultra-Orthodox party which backs Labor.
Mizrahi's move to Likud robbed Peres of the majority he needed to
form a government.
   Shamir still needs to pin down formal pledges of backing from
three religious parties and three ultra-rightist factions to assure
himself of a 61-seat majority.

   The charred Apollo capsule in which
three astronauts died 23 years ago will be given to the Smithsonian
Institution if museum officials want the spacecraft and agree not
to display it, NASA said today.
   ``We're concerned it not turn into a sideshow of any kind,''
said John Lawrence, chief of congressional affairs for NASA's
Office of Space Flight. ``Of course, the Smithsonian doesn't
operate like that.''
   Remnants of the 1967 Apollo fire _ America's first space tragedy
_ were to have been buried without fanfare this month in an
abandoned missile silo at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The
more than 17,600 pounds of material would have been placed on top
of debris from the nation's only other space disaster, the 1986
Challenger explosion.
   The Apollo capsule and investigative material had been stored at
NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., for 23 years; the
space agency wanted to find a final resting place for it. Some of
the items were moved late last month to Kennedy Space Center
awaiting burial.
   Smithsonian officials indicated this month they were interested
in some of the pieces after turning down offers from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration late last year and in 1985,
Lawrence said.
   Derek Elliott, curator for the National Air and Space Museum,
part of the Smithsonian, has said he is interested in obtaining the
capsule as a historic artifact, not a display item.
   ``That's one reason why we'd want it. It's a historically
significant artifact,'' said Dom Pisano, a museum curator and
chairman of the collections committee that will decide the matter.
   Smithsonian officials have assured NASA a decision will be made
within the next month.
   ``Our clock is ticking. We're anxious to resolve this one way or
another,'' Lawrence said.
   Astronauts Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward
H. White II died Jan. 27, 1967, when fire engulfed the capsule
during a countdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission.
The fire, in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was triggered
by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath Grissom's couch
contacted metal.

   A six-legged, 12-foot-tall walking robot
designed for NASA to explore rugged terrain on Mars and the moon
took its first steps at Carnegie Mellon University, the school
announced today.
   ``The body is propelled in a motion similar to cross-country
skiing,'' said William L. Whittaker, chief of the project. ``A
single leg reaches out in front of the others, places itself firmly
on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine forward.''
   The aluminum robot named the Ambler has two sets of stacked
legs, with three legs per stack. Work began in 1987 and a prototype
took its first strides recently at the school's field robotics
center.
   The multiple-leg array allows the robot to remain level on
uneven ground. The design provides a stable platform for sensors,
scientific equipment and sample-taking tools.
   The Ambler is one project being evaluated under the Planetary
Rover program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The program is developing robotic and manned technology to explore
hard-to-reach lunar and planetary surfaces.
   ``The intent for the vehicles ... is for them to be capable of
operating on their own with just a very general set of
directions,'' said David B. Lavery, manager of the NASA program.
   ``Robots are not susceptible to temperature changes or radiation
exposure on the long flights required to reach the planets,''
Whittaker said. ``They can spend protracted time on a mission that
would be impossible for an astronaut.''

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev meet May
31-June 3 against the backdrop of a changing world. The Soviet
empire is breaking apart, in Eastern Europe and around the world.
Even within the Soviet borders, democracy is showing its face.
   In a four-part series for Monday through Thursday, May 21-24,
Associated Press writers look at the changes within the Soviet
empire and the impact on the Western alliance. Each story runs
about 900 words. The package will be illustrated by graphics.
   Monday's story will move today as b0454. The remaining three
stories will move Friday.
   
   Here is a brief description of the stories:

   WASHINGTON _ Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe last year
gave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the victory for freedom
and democracy it had sought for four decades. But it also stole
NATO's main reason for being _ leading some analysts to question
where the alliance is headed.

   Tuesday
   
   WASHINGTON _ From Africa to Latin America to Eastern Europe, the
Soviet empire is crumbling. Soviet troops are out of Afghanistan,
the Marxist-linked Sandinista regime in Nicaragua is toppled, and
the governments of Ethiopia and Mozambique are veering away from
hardline Marxist ideologies.
   The disintegration of the empire has taken Mikhail Gorbachev by
surprise and dramatically altered his stance as he heads into his
Washington summit with President Bush.

and economic self-interest. Inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost, or openness, everyone seems to want something. Many of
the demands are mutually exclusive.

<HEAD>Nothing Left to Chance When Emperor Leaves Palace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAGASAKI, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the emperor of Japan leaves his
palace in Tokyo, nothing is left to chance.
   Determined to eliminate the element of surprise, officials in
this scenic coastal city on the southern island of Kyushu have
slaved for months over preparations for the arrival Friday of
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.
   Officials are particularly nervous because the emperor is to
meet Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, who was shot in the back by a
rightist in January. The attacker was angry at Motoshima for saying
the late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   About 4,000 police officers were being mobilized to ensure the
monarch's safety.
   Highlighting the emperor's four-day stay will be a visit to an
atomic bomb memorial at Peace Park, and the 41st annual Arbor Day
Festival on Sunday.
   The emperor, who is to plant a tree and give a short address, is
scheduled to spend less than an hour at the festival, but officials
reportedly are spending $50,000 to deodorize a nearby pig farm.
   They also are planning to hang a curtain to keep the farm out of
the royal couple's sight, and have told media hoping to cover the
event by helicopter not to create any ruckus that might disturb the
animals.
   ``Sure, if the wind is right it could smell pretty bad at the
festival,'' said Yoichi Tanaka, head of general affairs for the
Nagasaki Prefectural Trade Union. ``But it's a pig farm, after all,
and there really isn't any need to try to hide that.''
   The strengthened police presence prompted a local newspaper, the
Nagasaki Shimbun, to complain in an editorial Thursday that
``excessive security'' could dampen ``the Nagasaki people's natural
desire to welcome their emperor.''
   The editorial, however, acknowledged the need for tight security
wherever the emperor goes. Leftist radicals strongly oppose the
monarchy and often have used violence to gain publicity for their
views.
   The same month that Motoshima was shot, leftists claimed
responsibility for firing projectiles that slightly damaged the
Tokyo home of the emperor's younger brother, Prince Hitachi.
   Public opinion polls indicate the overwhelming majority of
Japanese support the monarchy, but there also are painful memories
of World War II, when the emperor's name was used to inspire
Japan's troops.
   After the war, Hirohito, whom the Japanese now call Emperor
Showa, visited all of Japan's prefectures except Okinawa, a string
of southern islands where some of the war's bloodiest battles were
fought and where ill feelings toward Tokyo still linger.
   Radicals broke through security and hurled firebombs at Akihito
and Michiko when they visited Okinawa in 1975. Akihito, then crown
prince, and his wife narrowly escaped injury.

<TEXT>
   Tribal chiefs worried about the spread of
AIDS have banned the ancient custom of widows and widowers having
sex with a relative of their late spouse to ``cleanse'' themselves.
   Chiefs in Chikankata and Monze districts, about 80 miles south
of Lusaka, ordered a halt to the practice after AIDS educators
visited, a health ministry spokesman said Thursday.
   Under the custom, a widow would have sex with one of her
husband's brothers, and a widower would arrange a sexual encounter
with one of his late wife's relatives.
   The tradition contributed to the spread of AIDS, ``especially,
of course, if a spouse died from AIDS,'' said the spokesman, who
was not identified in keeping with standing practice.
   In Africa, AIDS is mainly spread by heterosexual contact and the
use of contaminated blood or medical equipment. The problem is
aggravated by poor health services in isolated areas.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   Zambia has one of the world's highest AIDS rates. Up to 20
percent of the population of 7.5 million people is believed
infected with the virus that causes the disease.
   In March, the government told the World Health Organization that
Zambia had 2,417 cases of AIDS.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Says His Directions Led To Cabinet Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski told
former House colleagues Thursday that pointing the way to a
restroom could lead to a Cabinet post, just as it did for him.
   During an awards ceremony on the House floor, the former
Illinois congressman described how 22 years ago, he ran into a
``freshman Republican congressman by the name of George Bush.''
   ``I didn't know him, he didn't know me,'' Derwinski said. ``But
he said, `By the way, where's the men's room?' ''
   Derwinski pointed the way, and Bush ``was forever grateful for
that help.''
   ``That's how you get to the Cabinet, fellows,'' said Derwinski,
whose buttercup yellow blazer stood out in sharp contrast to a sea
of blues, grays and pinstripes.
   Derwinski, who became the first veterans secretary when the
Veterans Administration achieved Cabinet status last year, was
given the distinguished service award from the Association of
Former Members of Congress.
   Derwinski was introduced by former Rep. Abner J. Mikva, a fellow
Illinoisian who is now a federal judge. Mikva mentioned Derwinski's
``skills, talents and color.''
   Among those attending the ceremony were former House speakers
Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill of Massachusetts and Jim Wright of Texas.

<HEAD>Ancient Fossil Missing Link in Ancestors of Mammals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-misclassified fossil of a 280
million-year-old animal with three pairs of horns on its head is a
missing link in the family tree of the ancient reptiles that were
ancestors of the mammals, according to a report today.
   Researchers believe the creature, known as tetraceratops,
represents an evolutionary step between the older, reptile-like
animals called the pelycosaurs and the later therapsids that were
forerunners of the mammals.
   The fossil skull was discovered around the turn of the century
in Texas, but its evolutionary significance was not recognized
because it was surrounded in rock that was hard to remove.
   The discovery of its place in evolution was made by Michel
Laurin and Robert R. Reisz of the University of Toronto. They
reported their work in the British journal Nature.
   ``As the most primitive known therapsid,'' they wrote,
``tetraceratops bridges the large morphological gap between
primitive and advanced mammal-like reptiles.''
   They based their analysis largely on the shape of the bones and
teeth of the fossilized head. It combined primitive features of the
pelycosaurs as well as hints of the more modern therapsids that
came after them.
   Since only the creature's head was recovered, the scientists did
not speculate about the size or shape of its body.
   The animals lived before the rise of the dinosaurs, which ruled
the planet during the Mesozoic era, which began 225 million years
ago. The first mammals were tiny, shrew-like animals that lived
during the Jurassic period between 180 million and 130 million
years ago.

   A wildfire apparently sparked by a burning barn has
scorched 10,000 acres of tinder-dry sawgrass in the Everglades,
officials said Thursday.
   ``It's dry out there. It's like a tinderbox,'' said Peter Burke,
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry, blaming Florida's
20-month-long drought for the rapid spread of the flames near the
Dade-Broward county line.
   He said the fire broke out Wednesday and grew to 10,000 acres by
Thursday morning. Gusts up to 20 mph complicated fightfighting
efforts.
   Eight state firefighters were at the site Thursday, and crews
planned to set backfires along canals to deprive the fire of fuel
and prevent it from jumping the waterways, said Burke.
   There are no structures threatened in the uninhabited area, but
a fishing camp was briefly evacuated Wednesday.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Improving From Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin showed a
``marked improvement'' Thursday after being hospitalized and
diagnosed as suffering from pneumonia, officials said.
   Dr. Motti Lifshitz, deputy director of Shaarei Tzedek Hospital
in Jerusalem, said he hoped Begin would be released soon.
   ``Taking the general condition of the patient as an indicator of
improvement ... there is a marked improvement,'' Lifshitz said on
Israel army radio.
   Begin, 76, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in making
peace with Egypt, was brought to Shaarei Tzedek on Wednesday by
ambulance after complaining of weakness.
   Begin slept through the night after undergoing tests, hospital
spokeswoman Orna Cohen said.
   ``Everything is under control. It was recommended that he rest a
little, and he is receiving antibiotics,'' Mrs. Cohen said.
   Begin's daughters, Hasia and Leah, and one of his granddaughters
have been staying with him since he arrived at the hospital, the
spokeswoman said.
   Begin's son, Benjamin, a member of parliament representing the
right-wing Likud party which his father founded, is overseas.
   Yehiel Kadishai, a Begin aide who visited the former premier
Thursday, said Begin read newspapers, focusing on reports about the
difficulties faced by Likud in forming Israel's next government.
   ``He said `Let's hope it will be all right' but did not give any
advice,'' Kadishai said.
   Begin has not received other visitors following the doctors'
recommendation that he rest, and two private guards are posted
outside his room, Mrs. Cohen said.
   Begin, who became prime minister in 1977, abruptly resigned in
September 1983 and has since lived in seclusion in Jerusalem.
   Aides said at the time of his resignation that Begin was
depressed over the death of his wife, Aliza, and over Israel's
unsuccessful war in Lebanon.
   While serving as prime minister, Begin suffered several heart
attacks. In 1986, he underwent prostate surgery. He was briefly
hospitalized in 1987 and in 1989 after complaining of weakness.

   Walter ``Skeet'' Rogers put on metal
gloves, grabbed a 3-foot-long alligator and slung it into a cotton
wagon, moving it to high ground before flood waters got it.
   ``The last time we got to fooling with them, one man got 47
stitches,'' Rogers said, explaining the gloves.
   Rogers' 4,000 alligators were hatched from eggs gathered from
wild nests and raised in double-decked ponds in four
climate-controlled cinder-block buildings. Two more buildings are
under construction at his Bayou Pierre Gator Farm, located on low
land near the bayou for which it is named.
   About 200 square miles of Louisiana is flooded by water from the
Red River and backwaters such as Bayou Pierre. Most of the land in
a sparsely settled section of the state is for farming cotton,
wheat, soybeans.
   Rogers' crop is different, though no less threatened.
   ``It's awful. The water keeps coming up,'' said Alice Hart,
Rogers' mother. ``I've been right here for 12 years, and nothing
like this has ever happened before.
   ``They'll drown. Skeet sold off some of the big ones, but the
rest will just drown, if it keeps coming up.''
   With hides bringing $35 a linear foot and demand for alligator
meat high, alligator farming is a burgeoning industry in an
economically depressed state. Louisiana has 92 licensed gator
farms. Two-dozen license applications are pending. Three years ago,
there were 13 alligator farms in Louisiana.
   Buddy Goatcher, an alligator biologist with the state Department
of Wildlife and Fisheries, said it is possible gators could be
drowned if trapped in deep water for a long time with no firm
resting place.
   ``The farmer can't predict how long the waters will be up,''
Goatcher said. ``And you can't predict the force of the water. It
could knock down the building and send gators spewing all over the
place.''
   ``The threat is not so much to the well-being of the gators.
They'd love it,'' he said. ``The threat is losing the farm.''
   Along with the buildings and the concrete ponds, special heaters
are necessary to keep it warm enough for a good hatching rate and
optimum growth.
   ``He doesn't want a lot of cold water coming in,'' Goatcher said.
   Rogers and two helpers, Roy Cheatwood and his son, Roy Jr.,
piled homemade sandbags around pumps, heaters and other immovable
equipment, trying to protect them from the flood.
   The alligators were packed into four cotton wagons parked on a
nearby mound.
   Each gator had to be moved by hand.
   ``We can't get behind them with horses and drive them to high
ground,'' Rogers said.

   President Bush said today that civil rights
laws ``should not be turned into some lawyers' bonanza'' and he
will reject any legislation that he believes will result in hiring
quotas.
   ``I want to sign a civil rights bill but I will not sign a quota
bill,'' Bush told a Rose Garden audience in a ceremony to honor the
newly reconstituted President's Commission on Civil Rights.
   The Justice Department has raised the possibility that Bush
would veto civil rights legislation pending in Congress. The
department contends it would establish unconsitutional minority
quotas. Many Republicans have joined Democrats and the chairman of
Bush's civil rights commission in contending it does not require
quotas.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, earlier stopped short
of saying the administration would veto the legislation. ``We are
not repeating'' the veto threat, he said this week.
   On Capitol Hill, Senate supporters of the bill softened it
somewhat today and immediately drew fresh support from two
Republicans and six Democrats, bringing the total cosponsors to 47
in the 100-member Senate.
   ``There are several others who are very close and I think there
are others who will be coming on board,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., said as he and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., added their names as
cosponsors.
   Bush said today his goal is to make sure that ``affirmative
action is not reduced to some empty slogan and that this principle
of striking down all barriers to advancement has real, living
meaning to all Americans.''
   ``We will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we
work to advance America's civil rights agenda,'' he said to
applause from the audience that included many civil rights leaders.
   ``This administration seeks equal opportunity and equal
protection and equal protection under the law for all Americans,''
Bush said.
   He said he would ``enthusiastically support legislation'' that
backs up the principles of removing employment barriers based on
race, religion, sex, color or national origin; does not result in
quota systems; promotes fairness in the legal system; and
protection against harassment based on race, sex, religion or
physical disability.
   ``Our civil rights laws, however, should not be turned into some
lawyers' bonanza'' that could result from complaints of
discrimination under the law, he said.
   Bush's remarks followed a series of meetings with civil rights
leaders on the so-called Kennedy-Hawkins legislation, which is
still awaiting final action in both the House and Senate.
   Although it does not call for quotas of minority applicants,
critics contend that would be its result.
   The legislation would undo a Supreme Court decision that
narrowed the ability of minorities to win monetary damages for job
discrimnation, and would restore the burden of proof to defendants
in cases where employers' hiring practices allegedly had a
discriminatory impact.
   ``No one here today would want me to sign a bill whose
unintended consequences are quotas. Because quotas are wrong and
they violate the most basic principles of our civil rights
tradition and the basic principles of the promise of democracy,''
Bush said.
   The key change made by senators today would alter a provision of
the bill designed to undo the Supreme Court's 1989 Wards Cove
decision, involving a fair-hiring case at an Alaskan salmon cannery.
   Under the decision, employers named in fair-hiring lawsuits must
either end lopsided hiring practices or prove that they represent
business necessity. As the bill initially went into the hopper,
employers would have to prove that discrimination was ``essential''
to job performance.
   The new version would require only proof that such practices had
a ``substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job
performance.''

<HEAD>Court Says Missouri River Flow Should Not be Reduced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE LAHAMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court panel today upheld the
power of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to regulate the flow of
water from a 232-mile-long Missouri River reservoir.
   The three-judge panel overruled a district court decision that
had ordered the corps last week to temporarily reduce by about
one-third the discharge from the Oahe reservoir.
   The upper Missouri River basin states of South Dakota, North
Dakota and Montana brought the suit in an effort to protect their
sport fishing industry, which officials say is being decimated by
the low river levels.
   The case has created controversy among seven Midwestern states.
The downstream states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri are
aligned with the corps.
   The panel, which heard arguments in the case Wednesday, said it
announced a decision today because of the urgency of the issue. It
said it would release a formal opinion later.
   On Friday, the panel issued an emergency stay blocking the lower
court order.
   Today, the panel said the district court erred in concluding
that the corps was arbitrary and capricious in making its decision
about water flow.
   The corps appealed the ruling issued last Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Patrick Comny in Bismarck, N.D., that the level of
Lake Oahe be maintained until June 1, when the walleye hatch is
completed.
   John Stahr, a Justice Department trial attorney representing the
corps, said it was acutely aware of the harm to the tourism
industry caused by drought in the area.
   However, to reduce the Oahe discharges by one-third would mean
halting barge traffic between Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Louis, a
730-mile shipping channel, because the river level would be too
low, Stahr said.
   Former Gov. William Janklow of South Dakota, a lawyer
representing the Dakotas and Montana, argued that a temporary
disruption in barge traffic must be balanced against the viability
of the economy of central South Dakota, which relies heavily on
Missouri River tourism.
   Lake Oahe stretches north from a dam just north of Pierre, S.D.,
to just south of Bismarck.

   Federal officials have warned religious
broadcasters and churches around the country to screen mail because
of last month's explosion of a package addressed to evangelist Pat
Robertson.
   Cedric W. Lawrence Jr. of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in
Richmond said he sent letters to 185 religious broadcasters and
groups, including such figures as the Revs. Billy Graham and Jerry
Falwell.
   Thomas Love, an FBI agent in Norfolk, said the bureau notified
all its offices after the bombing at Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network headquarters.
   ``Individually, some of those offices have contacted churches to
alert them to the information,'' Love said.
   On April 27, a bomb in small package exploded in the CBN
mailroom in Virginia Beach after it was identified as suspicious
and a guard attempted to open it. Scott Scheeper, 33, was hit in
the leg by several pieces of shrapnel and was hospitalized for
several days.
   The package was addressed to Robertson, founder and president of
CBN and an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination.
   On Jan. 30, a mail bomb exploded at the church of the Rev. John
Osteen in Houston. Osteen's daughter was slightly injured when she
opened a shoebox-sized package.
   Both packages were mailed from small towns in Bladen County,
N.C., investigators said. Postal inspectors have released two
similar composite drawings of men suspected of mailing the packages.
   Robertson said the bombings ``could be part of pattern of
attacks against evangelical Christians.''
   Robertson also mentioned an April 17 arson at the offices of
gospel singer Sandi Patti in Anderson, Ind.
   Ms. Patti and a fire department investigator said there were no
indications of any connection between the arson and the bombings.
The fire caused $650,000 in damage.
   An anonymous phone caller told a newspaper that a group called
the Equal Religious Coalition started the fire because ``anyone who
sells God or religion'' should be attacked.
   ``We have not yet identified that that organization does exist.
Nor can we find any hint of a home base for that organization,''
said Terry King, the Anderson Fire Department's chief of
investigation. ``Experts from the East Coast to the West Coast
haven't heard of them.''
   Television evangelists said they have been the target of hate
mail in the past.
   ``We always have threats _ as many as eight or nine a month
several years ago, but it's slowed down in the last few months,''
Robertson said.
   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Lynchburg-based Falwell, said the
``Old-Time Gospel Hour'' pastor also receives threats, but ``there
have been years where we would receive more threats than we do
today.''
   Others haven't talked about threats.
   ``It really hadn't been discussed or even mentioned up until the
bombing at CBN,'' said the Rev. Brandt Gustavson, president of the
825-member National Religious Broadcasters. ``We have supplied some
names and addresses of our members to the postal inspectors.''
   Osteen's Lakewood Church in Houston is taking added precautions.
   ``The only thing that we have done any different is that the
U.S. marshal's office is scanning our mail on daily basis,'' said
Renee Branson, a church spokeswoman. ``The post office takes our
mail to the marshals who scan it before it is taken to the local
post office for delivery to us. It takes a day or so longer, but
nobody seems to mind.''
   At CBN, spokeswoman Frankie Abourjilie said, ``After talking
with postal inspectors it was obvious our system worked.'' But, she
added, ``we're tightening things up.''

<HEAD>Organizers Say Plans For Radio Ship Postponed Indefinitely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to beam pro-democracy messages to
China from a radio ship have been postponed indefinitely, an
organizer said Thursday, because Taiwan refused to allow a powerful
transmitter through customs.
   ``We are anti-Communist but we cannot violate international
law,'' government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said. ``This government
does not support the broadcasting plans and we cannot help them
install the transmitters.''
   Without the transmitter sent from France, it would be impossible
to proceed with the broadcasts, said Christophe Nick, an organizer
of the Goddess of Democracy ship.
   Nick refused to blame Taiwan, but Shaw said customs would not
approve the transmitter.
   Although Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party is the sworn enemy of
the Beijing government, tensions between the two sides have eased
in recent years and Taiwan wants to avoid angering Beijing.
   China has accused Taiwan of secretly helping the Goddess of
Democracy and has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
broadcasts.
   The Nationalist government has denied involvement in the project
and has said it opposed unauthorized broadcasts from international
waters.
   The 1,200-ton vessel, which left France on March 17, arrived in
the northern port of Keelung on Sunday to take on provisions before
sailing into international waters to broadcast toward Communist
China.
   Organizers originally planned to leave Keelung Thursday and
begin broadcasts the following day. But the customs difficulties
appear to have stymied the project.
   Organizers had hoped the Taiwanese government would look more
favorably on the project, sponsored by a coalition of press
organizations headed by the French magazine Actuel.
   ``The association will never stop trying to broadcast,'' Nick
said. ``Never, never, never.''
   The ship is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square in Beijing in May 1989. It was destroyed during
the June 4 military crackdown that left hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of civilians dead.

<TEXT>
   A former Panamanian president says his son
shouldn't be on trial for threatening to kill President Bush
because ``that's the way we express ourselves'' in Panama.
   Demetrio B. Lakas, president of Panama from 1972-78, told jurors
Wednesday that death threats are a way of life in the country where
he lives and where his son, Otto Lakas, was born.
   ``My life was threatened thousands of times,'' the elder Lakas
said. ``That's the way we express ourselves. Saying it and doing it
are two different things.''
   Otto Lakas is accused of making the threat in a discussion with
the managers of a pawnshop where he was looking at a gun.
   In the U.S. District Court trial's second day today, family and
friends continued testifying about the non-aggressive nature of
Lakas, a 21-year-old architecture student at Lubbock Christian
University.
   ``When Otto sees pain in others, he assumes the pain,'' his
mother, Elizabeth Lakas said. ``I am very proud to have him for my
son.''
   Lakas reportedly said he had ``a bullet with Bush's name
engraved on it,'' and if the president came to Lubbock he was
``going to blow his (expletive) head off.''
   Family and friends have characterized the statements as a joke.
But Secret Service agents took Lakas at his word and have jailed
him without bond since April 17.
   If convicted, he faces a 5-year prison term or a $250,000 fine,
or both.
   Lakas' attorney, Tommy Turner, told jury members the government
would be unable to prove Lakas ``understood and meant'' what he was
saying or that he ``knowingly and willfully intended to be taken
seriously.''
   Prosecutor Paulina Jacobo would not comment about what the
government could prove.
   Stacy and Tracy Nichols, twin brothers who manage their parents'
Exect Pawn Shop, said they talked to Otto Lakas on April 4 for
almost three hours while Lakas considered buying a .357 Colt
revolver.
   Stacy Nichols said Lakas told him he wanted the gun for
protection.
   While discussing ``everything that 21-year-olds talk about,''
Stacy Nichols said Lakas voiced anger about the December invasion
of Panama by U.S. troops. ``I have a .223-caliber rifle at home and
a bullet with Bush's name engraved on it,'' Nichols quoted Lakas as
saying in a Secret Service affidavit. Stacy Nichols said in an
April 17 Secret Service affidavit that he was afraid to report
Lakas' statements to authorities because he was ``afraid that Otto
Lakas will retaliate.''
   But Nichols testified Wednesday that Lakas' alleged threats were
the only serious part of a three-hour conversation filled with
jokes.
   Nichols said he liked Lakas and was never concerned for his own
safety while Lakas was in the pawnshop. Despite the threats,
Nichols said, he would have sold the revolver to Lakas if Lakas had
produced the money.
   Nichols said the incident would never have been reported if they
hadn't told a friend who is a police officer about the
conversation. The officer told a Secret Service agent, John Steven
Barker.
   Barker said a search of Lakas' apartment produced a .30-.30
caliber rifle. A box of bullets also was found, but none was
engraved with Bush's name, Barker said.

<HEAD>Mine Closure Following Racial Clash That Killed Two</HEAD>

   The country's largest mining
company shut down part of a gold mine Thursday following a racial
clash that left two whites dead and several blacks injured.
   The victims were among 12 people killed in nationwide violence
Wednesday, police said Thursday.
   Heavily armed police and mine security officials for the
Anglo-American Corp. sealed off part of the President Steyn gold
mine near the central city of Welkom following Wednesday's fighting.
   Blacks attacked whites at the gold mine after security guards
fired on black protesters with rubber bullets, wounding at least
eight blacks. Two whites were killed and four hurt by the black
workers, who were protesting the dismissal of 30 miners.
   Anglo-American, a huge mining conglomerate, said one mine shaft
was closed because of the tense atmosphere and some 4,000 workers
were sent home. Other shafts on the mine compound remained open.
   Welkom, 170 miles south of Johannesburg, has been the scene of
repeated confrontations between blacks and right-wing whites in
recent weeks.
   The neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement said white miners
should be allowed to take weapons underground to protect
themselves. The said the current tension could only be defused
through ``strong action by the government and its security forces.''
   About 100 white right-wingers armed with shotguns, pistols,
whips and knives demonstrated Wednesday night in Welkom to protest
the deaths of the two whites.
   Right-wing leader Blikkies Blignaut, said, ``If we don't get
joy, we will start action as a resistance movement and there will
be hell on Earth.''
   Extreme white right-wingers have formed paramilitary groups to
``control'' blacks in Welkom. Blacks, meanwhile, have boycotted
white-owned businesses for almost two weeks.
   White and black leaders fear the growing threat of violence by
extreme right-wingers could hamper political reform efforts.
President F.W. de Klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution with
black opposition groups, but he faces a growing backlash from
conservative whites.
   In violence elsewhere:
   _Two black adults and two black girls were burned to death when
their shack was set alight as they slept Wednesday night, police
said. A man was arrested, but police said they had not determined a
motive for the attack near the central city of Kroonstad.
   _A leader of the Inkatha political movement, Jerome Mncwabe, was
gunned down Wednesday night at his home near Pietermaritzburg in
Natal Province, police said. Inkatha, a conservative Zulu movement,
has been fighting with militant black groups in Natal.
   _A white security guard was killed at a construction site near
Durban when a group of blacks opened fire with pistols, police
said. Another guard drove off the attackers with pistol fire, they
said.
   _Four blacks were killed in other incidents, apparently clashes
between rival black factions, but police gave no details. Hundreds
of people have died in recent months in fighting between rival
black factions.

<HEAD>House Youth Service Bill Praised</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Community and state leaders voiced support
Thursday for a youth service bill.
   ``Youth service tells young people they are needed, appeals to
their desire to participate and gives them an opportunity to make a
difference,'' said David Liederman, executive director of the Child
Welfare League of America Inc.
   The support boosts efforts of the House Education and Labor
Committee, which is preparing to consider legislation that puts it
at odds with a Senate-passed bill tying youth community work with
student financial aid.
   ``Our agencies are in complete agreement with you that service
should be entirely voluntary and non-participation should not
disqualify young Americans from any existing educational loans,
grants or opportunities,'' Liederman said.
   The House bill would authorize $35 million for school-based
programs that make community service an important element of
learning; $25 million in grants to institutions of higher education
to create or expand service opportunities for their students; $30
million to fund demonstration programs targeted to school dropouts
and rural youth; and $93 million to establish three specific youth
oriented demonstration programs.
   Liederman, who said his group is the oldest and largest
membership organization of child and youth serving agencies with
more than 650 members throughout North America, was among a host of
community and state leaders who urged quick passage of the National
Service Act of 1990 during the final hearing on the bill.
   The Senate passed its version in early March.
   Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said the House committee
probably would consider the legislation before July and hoped floor
action would follow soon after.
   The House measure rejects any link between service and student
financial assistance. Hawkins said the House version was ``intended
to build upon worthwhile local and state efforts and to enhance
their potential for addressing unmet social needs.''
   Liederman said the range of programs created by the bill should
attract and make services available to every type of young person.
The program, he said, shifts youths from being clients to
``community resources.''
   ``Our youth are not unwilling to serve,'' said John Buchanan
Jr., a former congressman who is chairman of People For the
American Way Action Fund, a liberal group.
   ``The underlying principle of the National Service Act rightly
assumes that American young people will embrace community service
if the opportunities are presented to them. Involvement in service
activities enables young people _ whether poor or affluent,
residents of the inner cities or suburbs, achievers or at-risk
children _ to realize that they have much to give to their
community.''
   Brian Holloway of the New York State Division for Youth said
``structured, dynamic programs'' were needed to ``expose youth to
meaningful and practical experience, responsibility, participation,
membership, through community service in schools and on a full-time
basis.''

<TEXT>
   Janet Jackson paraded her Rhythm Nation tour
through Tokyo Dome on Thursday night, her thunderous waves of funk
and choreography inspiring about 50,000 people to clap in unison
and dance in their assigned seats.
   Teen-agers in miniskirts, families with children and men in
business suits rose as one when the American pop star, silhouetted
in colored smoke, was lifted to the massive stage on a platform and
launched into ``Control.''
   ``Want to get nasty?'' she yelled with two female and four male
dancers behind her in various stages of undress as she strutted and
rapped her way through ``Nasty.'' Fans roared politely in approval.
   It was the opening for Miss Jackson's five-night appearance in
Japan on her first world tour. She travels next to the Japanese
cities of Osaka and Yokohama, back to the United States and then on
to Europe in September.
   The energy and enthusiasm of Miss Jackson and her 15-member
troupe managed to punch through the cavernous expanse of Tokyo
Dome, an indoor baseball stadium nicknamed the Big Egg.
   But fans in the middle and upper reaches had to depend on giant
video screens showing the action far below, and the sound was out
of sync with the action because it took so long to travel to their
ears.
   Fiery explosions heralded ``The Knowledge,'' and the crowd
shouted along with Miss Jackson and the onstage marquee lights as
she chanted: ``Ignorance, no. Bigotry, no. Illiteracy, no.''
   Dave Barry's searing guitar solo highlighted ``Black Cat,'' and
Miss Jackson danced and sang atop the stage's second level as
explosions and red and orange spotlights cut through the smoke.
   The sounds and flashes of a summer thunderstorm opened ``Come
Back to Me,'' which allowed the sultry rock star to show a
reflective, wistful side.
   She donned a paramilitary uniform with medals and billed hat _ a
getup mimicked by many of her fans _ to close the show with
``Rhythm Nation,'' a song popularized by its use since January in
Japan Airlines commercials.The choreography, a cross between
break-dancing and military maneuvers, sent some spectators dancing
into the aisles.

   The White House press office dropped an
experimental limit on cameras Thursday and the networks were back
in the Oval Office covering President Bush.
   They gathered in full force to cover the outset of Bush's
meeting with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``Look who's back. Welcome back, gang,'' Bush said as the
cameras rolled and a dozen boom microphones stretched for his every
word. ``It's been very lonely without you fellows.''
   The four networks boycotted coverage of two White House events
Wednesday in protest of the experimental restrictions, first tried
Monday.
   ``You win. I cave,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters at another event.
   Fitzwater complained Wednesday that the networks were operating
by ``horse-and-buggy rules'' in an era with space-age camera
technology.
   George Watson, ABC-TV's Washington bureau chief, said he was
``pleasantly surprised'' at the about-face. The network chiefs
still want a meeting with Fitzwater to discuss ``whatever problems
concern him,'' Watson said.
   ``We have no interest in bopping people on the head with
microphones or scratching antiques. We do want to maintain as much
competition as we can at the White House,'' Watson said.
   A Fitzwater aide, John Herrick, said the networks mounted their
protest so quickly, ``we felt it wasn't worth fighting them.''
   ``For the time being we are reverting to the standard pool
coverage,'' said Herrick, who arranges many of the news pools.
   The networks _ CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN _ skipped two Bush meetings
with groups lobbying on a civil rights bill Wednesday.
   Earlier, they went along with the limited, two-camera pool
coverage of other Bush meetings, including the start of the budget
summit with congressional leaders Tuesday.
   Fitzwater argued that the networks and independent television
stations alike could get more and better pictures if only two pool
cameras were sent into the Oval Office and other parts of the White
House with limited space.
   There is only one camera in the tight travel pool of reporters
and crew members who accompany the president whenever he leaves the
White House, including flights aboard Air Force One.
   Radio networks, in a gesture of sympathy, also declined to send
in a reporter to cover the two Bush meetings Wednesday.

   A company commander leading 400
soldiers on a conditioning run collided with a deer and was knocked
unconscious, authorities said Thursday.
   Capt. Ian Erickson didn't know what hit him May 7 until he
regained consciousness inside an Army ambulance and tasted deer fur
in his mouth, said Capt. Pauline Geraci, a public affairs
spokeswoman.
   ``He said the deer came crashing out of the woods _ just leaped
at him,'' Ms. Geraci said. Other soldiers ``said it sort of
sideswiped him and tumbled with him and then got up and ran off.''
   Ericson was left with chipped teeth, smashed glasses,
whiplash-like pain and a gash in the back of his head that required
stitches, the spokeswoman said.
   He has returned to his base at Fort Clayton, Panama, she said.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Surges, But Good News Seen in Export Boost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Record exports helped keep the U.S. trade
deficit in March below its 1989 monthly average, the government
reported Thursday, and analysts said the gap could narrow to less
than $100 billion this year for the first time since 1983.
   The Commerce Department said the March deficit totaled $8.45
billion, down from the $9 billion monthly gap last year but a sharp
38.5 percent increase over February.
   The jump resulted in part from a 10 percent increase in imports
to $41.72 billion, their highest level in five months. But
economists said the advance was a rebound from an 8.1 percent
decline in imports in February, which they called an aberration.
   The department said exports totaled $33.28 billion in March, up
4.6 percent from February and breaking the previous record of $31.9
billion set last January. The deficit is the difference between
imports and exports.
   The economists called the increase in exports a bright sign for
the overall economy.
   ``If they stay up, there's just almost no way we can have a
recession,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets in New York, who forecasts a deficit of $95
billion or less this year. ``It's absolutely what we need for our
economy to prosper.''
   Rising exports mean a stronger economy because more jobs and
profits are created as American factories produce more. That
produces more taxes and helps close the gap between what the
government receives and what it spends.
   But with rising imports, as reported for March, lead to a
decline in U.S. production and a loss in jobs as Americans spend
more on products made overseas.
   Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said exports are growing twice as fast as imports
and represent ``30 to 40 percent of our economic growth over the
past three years.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher noted the $23.9 billion
first-quarter imbalance was the smallest in more than six years and
continued the downward trend in the deficit.
   ``Strong export growth was the key to these favorable results,''
he said. ``I expect that we will see the trade deficit break $100
billion this year.''
   The deficit peaked at $152.12 billion in 1987 and then dropped
to $118.53 billion the following year and to $109 billion last
year. It has been above the $100 billion level since 1983 when it
totaled $52.4 billion.
   The March exports represented ``nice increases in computers,
electrical machinery, industrial machinery and scientific
equipment,'' Steinberg said.
   Holding down the export number was a decline in aircraft
shipments, which Robert Brusca, chief financial economist with
Nikko Securities Co. in New York, said resulted from the recent
Boeing Co. strike.
   ``When the Boeing strike ended at the end of last year,'' he
said, ``aircraft shipments were running at abnormal levels. Now
they are back down to more normal levels.''
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist with Fuji Securities
Inc., in Chicago, noted much of the import increase was
concentrated in automobiles and other consumer goods which, to some
extent, may be seasonal.
   Oil imports totaled 261 million barrels, up 7.4 percent from
February. But prices fell from $19.39 to $18.18 a barrel in March,
making the $4.7 billion import bill virtually the same as the
previous month.
   As usual, the deficit with Japan was the largest of any country.
It totaled $3.6 billion; followed by China and Taiwan, $600 million
each; Mexico and Brazil, $300 million each; and Canada, $100
million.
   The United States posted a $700 million surplus with the
countries of Western Europe.

<HEAD>Tracey Ullman Leaves Fox Network</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts one graf after 4th graf, `The British ...,' to add
that ``The Simpsons'' is a spin-off from Ullman's show.

   Tracey Ullman, whose offbeat comedy show
attracted a dedicated but small following and won Fox Broadcasting
Co. its first Emmy, has quit the fledgling network.
   ``I have decided not to go on with `The Tracey Ullman Show'
after four seasons in which I was constantly challenged and happily
tortured by a unique group of people,'' Miss Ullman said Wednesday.
``I thank Fox for letting somebody no one ever heard of do a show
on a network that didn't exist.''
   Miss Ullman's Saturday night show featured an array of comedians
and musical sketches and earned Fox four Emmys and 20 nominations.
   The British comic's seemingly endless lineup of characters and
accents helped make her one of the best known new performers in the
United States.
   ``The Simpsons'' originally appeared on the show in April 1987
and was spun off this year as its own program.
   Although critically acclaimed, the program never did well in the
ratings, often finishing last in the Nielsens. The final show has
been completed and is scheduled for May 26.
   Miss Ullman's departure came two days after her friend and
executive producer, James L. Brooks, announced he was leaving Fox
for Columbia Pictures Television.
   Miss Ullman leaves Fox four years into a five-year contract.
   ``I think it was probably mutually agreed upon,'' said Fox
spokeswoman Antonia Coffman. ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' will go
into syndication, she said.
   Miss Ullman co-stars with Kevin Kline in the recently released
film ``I Love You to Death'' and is in New York rehearsing for a
summer run of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' in Central Park with
Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.

   A Purdue University professor says
it ain't easy being Kermit. But when you're the namesake of a
famous frog, life isn't all bad.
   Kermit Scott was the grade-school friend of Muppets creator Jim
Henson, who died Wednesday in New York of complications from
bacterial pneumonia at age 53.
   Scott had not heard from his friend since he was 14. That's when
the Henson family left Leland, Miss., where the two grew up
together. But Scott learned from a newspaper article years ago that
the most famous of the Muppets was named for him.
   ``I guess I made an impression on him,'' said Scott.
   ``We had gone our ways, and I have very fond memories of our
time toegether,'' Scott said Wednesday.
   Named Theodore Kermit Scott Jr., he grew up being called Kermit
because his father used the name Theodore.
   ``It was a bit of a burden. No one else was ever named that,''
he said, but added, ``Now it's a name everybody knows.''
   Scott, a philosophy professor, says he often uses Muppets in his
lectures.
   The Kermit character, he said, has ``that kind of ability to
remain open to all of the possibilities, while at the same time
dealing with all the hassles.''
   He said he always has been flattered Henson used his name for
the puppet known for singing, ``It ain't easy being green.''
   ``I certainly felt there are a lot worse things my name could be
associated with. I'm very happy and proud of what he
accomplished,'' Scott said.

<HEAD>Bush Voices Strong Support for United Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs; edits thruout to tighten; no pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today voiced strong support for
a united Germany with ``full control over all its territory'' and
said reunification should completely end the allies' postwar rights
in Germany.
   ``Forty five years after the end of the war, there is no reason
that a unified Democratic Germany should be in any way singled out
for some special status,'' Bush said after meeting with West
Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Britain, France and the United States support West Germany's
call for a reunified Germany to be part of NATO. But the Soviet
Union _ the fourth of the big World War II victors _ argues that
the new Germany should be neutral, or a member of both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   What's clear, Bush said, ``is that the United States and the
Federal Republic of Germany share the same approach and have the
same goals regarding German unification.''
   ``We both want a united Germany which enjoys full sovereignty, a
united Germany which is a full member of the Western community and
of the NATO alliance, including participation in its integrated
military structures,'' he said.
   Bush said that a reunified Germany should ``have full control
over all of its territory without any new, discriminatory
constraints on German sovereignty.''
   He said he and Kohl agreed that U.S. forces should ``remain
stationed in the united Germany and elsewhere in Europe to continue
to promote stability and security.''
   Kohl thanked Bush for the ``magnificent support'' he had given
``Germans on our path to German unity.''
   Kohl said that a reunified Germany must remain a member of NATO
_ but he urged that the alliance concentrate more on its political
role than its military one.
   ``As the threat is decreasing appreciably, the alliance must
keep the initiative in the field of disarmament and arms control
and review its strategy and structure,'' he said.
   Earlier, at an Oval Office picture-taking session, Kohl said he
could not say whether German unity would come before the end of the
year _ even though he had said earlier that all-German elections
could come as early as Dec. 2.
   ``Nobody knows that. We know that the people are shouting, `we
are the people.' This is why nobody can fix an exact date. But
everything's going very well. We can say that.''
   Kohl's Christian Democratic Party lost two West German state
elections on Sunday, which some analysts saw as a reflection of
concern by voters over the cost and pace of reunification.
   Kohl said he intended to discuss the issue with Bush, although
added that Bush is well versed on the issue already.
   ``I think it's been rare to find a president in the history of
the United States who knows German history and German politics so
well as this president. And European politics,'' said Kohl,
speaking through a translator.
   ``And that of course is a lucky thing for us. And I think that
you should write that,'' Kohl told reporters.
   ``So do I,'' Bush chimed in.
   Bush and Kohl were also expected to discuss arms control, troops
in Europe and the situation in the rebellious Soviet republics of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
   It was Bush's final face-to-face meeting with the nation's key
allies as he prepares for his summit in two weeks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a superpower conference Bush says
is strained by the Baltic standoff.
   Kohl recently joined French President Francois Mitterrand in
urging Lithuanian leaders to lower some of their demands and seek a
negotiated settlement with the Kremlin.
   Bush has urged restraint on both sides.
   But administration sources said Bush is frustrated at lack of
progress toward a resolution of the Baltic issue, particularly with
respect to Lithuania. The Kremlin maintains a partial economic
blockade of the breakaway state.
   Bush told a news conference Wednesday that the pressure the
Soviet Union is applying to the Baltic states ``has certainly put
some tension on the summit'' between himself and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They meet in Washington from May 30-June 3.
   ``We want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you call
it _ discussions between Gorbachev and the Lithuanians get going.
And then I'd like to see the release of that economic pressure on
Lithuania. And that would clear the air fast,'' the president said.
   On Wednesday, Lithuania's parliament offered to suspend laws it
has enacted since declaring the republic's independence if the
Kremlin agrees to negotiate. However, the resolution did not
involve rescinding the March 11 declaration of independence as the
Kremlin demanded, a spokeswoman said.
   Today's session with Kohl was the president's concluding session
with Western allied leaders before the summit. Last month he met
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Bermuda and
Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla.
   He also has met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Aide Admits Failure of Economic Reforms, Asks For
Western Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top economic adviser to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday all economic reforms
in his country have failed, and he appealed to Western economists,
businesses and governments for help.
   ``If the West would help, this would in fact make the whole
difference,'' said Stanislav Shatalin.
   He spoke at a news conference called to discuss a new plan
whereby Western experts review Soviet and Eastern European economic
reform proposals.
   ``We have come to a very profound conclusion that without the
cooperation of the West, we simply can't build a market economy,''
said Shatalin, who is the only economist on the Presidential
Council that has been working on Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``I'm sure the president too shares this position,'' Shatalin
said.
   Shatalin was not specific about the type of Western aid Moscow
would like to see. Nor did he mention what political compromises,
if any, Gorbachev might consider to secure Western support.
   However, friction over the Baltic republics' drive for
independence and the Soviet refusal to consider a united Germany in
NATO would likely block any massive governmental aid from the West
now.
   Echoing similar comments by Gorbachev, Shatalin said many
Soviets oppose a market economy, expected to bring price increases
and unemployment.
   He cited an unspecified poll that he said showed 54 percent of
Soviets supported market reforms, but 46 percent were firmly
against them.
   Shatalin said, however, a market economy was the only choice.
   He said the Soviet Union has decided, along with other East
European nations, to join a new plan uniting about 50 top experts
to cull through reforms before they are implemented.
   The operation is being run by the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis based outside Vienna. It has brought
together Soviet, East European and Western economists and other
academics since it was founded in 1972.
   The Soviet Union needs ``the import of the best possible
brains'' to succeed in economic change, Shatalin said.
   He admitted that reforms introduced by Gorbachev, specifically
in 1988 and 1989, had failed to improve the economy. ``If anything,
the situation has deteriorated,'' he said.
   In 1988, state enterprises were supposed to gain greater
independence from central planning authorities. But bureaucrats
found ways around the new laws by introducing ``state orders'' the
enterprises had to meet, and thus retained control over the bulk of
their production.
   The economic deterioration is evident to Soviet consumers, who
face shortages of food and other goods.
   Asked why the Soviet leadership had not acted earlier to move to
a market economy, Shatalin again pointed to popular opposition.
   ``If you don't have real political support for the reforms, they
die out,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's latest package of promised reforms has yet to be
unveiled. The president told reporters Thursday the public was to
blame for their failure so far.
   ``Changing people's minds is the most difficult thing,'' he
said. ``Perestroika depends on public opinion, and it's
conservative.''
   Shatalin also blamed the relatively poor education of Soviet
economists for the failures to date.
   ``For a long time, I've said the level of our education in
economics is medieval,'' he said.
   ``The whole process of becoming more intelligent, more capable
is moving more slowly than it should,'' he said.

   The Dice Man didn't make last week's ``Saturday
Night Live'' its most-watched show this season, despite heavy
publicity before his appearance, Nielsen ratings showed Thursday
   The show, in which foul-mouth comic Andrew Dice Clay was host,
was fourth-ranked. It had an 8.8 rating and a 26 percent share of
the audience in its time period, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
figures.
   The series' ratings champion this season remains the Feb. 24
show, when Fred Savage of ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' was host. It
got a 10.7 rating and a 29 percent audience share. Each ratings
point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Saturday Night Live'' regular Nora Dunn and pop singer Sinead
O'Connor boycotted last week's program because of Clay. He has been
criticized for his coarse humor, which includes comments that
disparage women and homsexuals.
   Although his appearance earned the show record ratings for this
season in major cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, ``it
wasn't as big a draw in the smaller markets,'' an NBC spokeswoman
said.
   This season's final ``Saturday Night Live'' broadcast, with
Candice Bergen of CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' as host, will be shown
Saturday.
   No decision has been made about whether the satirical late-night
series will be renewed for a 16th season.

<HEAD>Kennedy Center Chairman Seeks Repair Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 18-year-old John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts needs $30.5 million to repair such things as a
leaky marble roof and crumbling garage, the facility's top
administrator said Thursday.
   James D. Wolfensohn told the House subcommittee on buildings and
grounds that river and roof terraces, parapets, planters and
building systems also need repairs.
   However, he said there was no danger to the estimated 4.9
million people who visit the 7,000-seat theater complex each year.
   ``If I thought it was unsafe we would close the building,''
Wolfensohn said. ``But we need to ensure the safety of the building
continues.''
   Wolfensohn, who has been chairman of the center for six weeks,
said the sprawling structure overlooking the Potomac River had been
poorly maintained and that fund-raising would not be able to meet
high repair costs.
   Basic maintenance has not been done in five years, he said.
   The Kennedy Center is operating with bank loans and using
advance ticket sales to pay bills and a $15.3 million deficit,
Wolfensohn said.
   The National Park Service performs daily maintenance, but
Wolfensohn wants Congress to consider who is ultimately responsible
for all upkeep of the $750 million building.
   Wolfensohn said the five-theater facility was not in danger of
closing.
   ``The performing arts is geerally a money loser,'' Wolfensohn
said.
   Rep. Sidney R. Yates, D-Ill., praised the center for raising
more than $50 million in the five years that ended in 1989 and
fully paying operating costs.

   Rose Marie Posey is officially alive
again after a computer error that declared her death was corrected.
Now, she's ready for ``The Tonight Show'' and ``Nightline.''
   The 73-year-old woman declared dead by U.S. Treasury Department
and insurance company computers got word Wednesday that the errors
had been fixed and her $871.13 monthly pension restored.
   And the local media darling is ready to go national.
   ``I'm happy, believe me,'' she said. ``I'll even get on an
airplane if they ask me and go to talk to Ted Koppel or Johnny
Carson _ and I hate to get on airplanes.
   ``I'm kind of liking the attention, you know.''
   Mrs. Posey learned of her ``death'' in April when she didn't
receive her monthly pension check from the Railroad Retirement
Board.
   On May 10, Medicare refused to pay a $25 claim she'd submitted
for minor foot surgery. The national health insurer told her in a
letter that the surgery ``was reported to be after the date of
death.''
   After her story appeared this week in newspapers, Med Pay Inc.,
a Springfield third-party administrator of group health plan
claims, stepped in and notified the government Mrs. Posey was
indeed alive.
   ``It needed somebody who just knew which button to push,''
company president Gordon L. Kinne said.
   Travelers Medicare service representative Debbie Petersen called
Mrs. Posey from Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday to say she was
once again alive in computer files, and the surgery claim would be
paid.

   Police stepped up security outside East
Germany's parliament Thursday after authorities reported death
threats against the president of the chamber.
   A bloc of leftist East German lawmakers criticized the security
measures, saying they were reminiscent of the policies of the
ousted Communist regime.
   Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said the dozens of extra
police and roadblocks were needed around the People's Chamber were
necessary because of ``numerous death threats'' against Parliament
President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl.
   ``The threats that reached us are credible,'' he said.
   Diestel, in charge of police functions in East Germany, said
authorities have also registered an increase in thefts of weapons
and explosives recently.
   The interior minister refused to give further details about the
case.
   In recent days, there has been increasing labor unrest as
workers express fears that unification with West Germany will cost
tens of thousands of jobs in East Germany.
   There was no word as to whether the death threats were connected
to the labor woes.
   The leftist coalition called Alliance 90 criticized the extra
police presence, saying it reminded them of ``the events of last
year.''
   Before his ouster October 18, hard-line Communist leader Erich
Honecker ordered massive police forces into the streets to break up
huge pro-democracy demonstrations.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday that
citizens' fear of change is holding back the economic and political
changes that would give them a better life.
   ``In politics, the public doesn't accept pluralism, and it has
complexes about ideological conceptions and cliches,'' he told
reporters at a parliamentary session in Moscow.
   ``Take any sphere, everywhere we are hindered by complexes,''
Gorbachev added. ``People are saying `Chaos, chaos, collapse,
collapse.' When Lenin watched a similar revolutionary process, he
said, `You know, this chaos will crystallize a new form of life.' ''
   Some of Gorbachev's economic advisers in the past have said the
public's conservative mood might hold back necessary economic
reforms that could lead to higher prices and unemployment, but
Gorbachev himself had not previously addressed the issue in such a
forthright manner.
   ``Perestroika depends on public opinion, and it's
conservative,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has delayed an economic reform plan over the past two
months. Aides have backed away from suggestions that Polish-style
``shock therapy'' was in store for the Soviet economy. Radical
measures in Poland brought sudden price increases and unemployment.
   Gorbachev has promised that nothing will be decided without
discussion. He also indicated the reform program will not be
discussed with his advisory Presidential Council until May 22.
   He spoke with reporters in the Kremlin's ornate St. George's
Hall during a break at the Congress of the Russian Federation,
where reformers forced his candidate for president into giving an
accounting of his performance as premier.
   Radicals said that will be embarrassing, given the country's
economic crisis. They hoped it could persuade Gorbachev to withdraw
Russian Premier Alexander V. Vlasov from the race against political
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and substitute a more centrist candidate.
   Otherwise, Gorbachev risks having Russia, the largest of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics, taken over by Yeltsin, the
silver-haired Siberian populist who is his most popular critic.
   Yet Gorbachev was off-hand when reporters asked him about the
struggle between Vlasov and Yeltsin.
   ``I see no drama in this,'' he said. ``This is all normal. The
(Communist) party has given up its monopoly.''
   ``Tomorrow or the next day, new parties will appear with their
own platforms and proposals, and this will be a normal process.''
   Newly elected radicals at the Russian congress are trying to
elect Yeltsin and wrest control of the republic's affairs away from
the national government.
   Russia is the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, with
52 percent of its people and three-quarters of its land mass. A
radical takeover of the 1,059-member Russian parliament threatens
Gorbachev's prestige. It could also undermine his authority, if
radicals try to increase the Russian parliament's power by
declaring that its laws take priority over national ones.
   Speaking to reporters, Gorbachev suggested that political groups
favoring reform should work together. ``Confrontation could lead to
bloodshed,'' he said.
   ``We were brought up differently. We think, `My opinion is right
and the others are wrong.' As a result, nobody is listening to
anybody.''
   Many hard-liners are unhappy with Gorbachev's recent moves to
end the Communist Party's monopoly on power, legalize private
ownership of factories and otherwise upset basic laws of Marxism.
   ``In economics, they say you must not touch this and you must
not touch that,'' Gorbachev said.
   Turning to Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who gave a television
interview last week on economic reform proposals, Gorbachev said:
``Ryzhkov only said a few words and already there is great
agitation in the country.''
   But the deputy premier in charge of economic reform said in the
Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia that reforms will not be painless.
   ``One model of the economy cannot be replaced by another without
someone being hurt,'' said Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin.
   In remarks carried by the official news agency Tass, he warned
that ``the transition to the market is perhaps the last chance
history gives to socialism. Only a market can heal our sick society
and even bring prosperity.''
   Abalkin said basic food prices will remain controlled and fixed
incomes will rise to match expected inflation.
   In Vienna, Austria, a top economic adviser to Gorbachev said all
economic reforms in the Soviet Union have failed, and he appealed
to Western economists, businesses and governments for help.
   ``If the West would help, this would in fact make the whole
difference,'' Stanislav Shatalin said at a news conference.

   A police officer who gives lectures on how
to thwart car thieves had his cruiser stolen after he left the keys
in the ignition.
   Lt. James Disanti left his car running early Wednesday in front
of a donut shop in this southwestern Pennsylvania town. When he
returned, the car was gone.
   State troopers spotted the car about an hour later at a gas
station. When the troopers flashed their headlights as a greeting,
the driver of the police car sped away, police said.
   After a short chase, troopers arrested David P. Sandrey, 22, of
Charleroi, and charged him with theft, criminal mischief and
fleeing police.
   Charleroi Police Chief Ed Hank said he probably won't take
disciplinary action against Disanti.
   ``I might sit him down and talk to him, though,'' the chief said.

<HEAD>Williams Seeks Arts Expertise on NEA Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of legislation to extend the life
of the troubled National Endowment for the Arts said Thursday he
was delaying the bill and asking arts experts to recommend changes
in the way the NEA operates.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., chairman of the House postesecondary
education subcommittee, said he wants artists and representatives
of at least 17 arts-related groups to meet next Tuesday and suggest
NEA changes.
   The NEA has been criticized by conservatives, who have tried to
place new limits on the way it awards grants.
   Williams, at a news conference, said he was convinced the NEA
has broad support in Congress. But because of protests over the
funding of recent controversial exhibits, Williams said, a bill to
reauthorize the NEA for five years is unlikely to pass Congress
without some amendments.
   Williams is sponsoring a bill backed by the Bush administration.
A group of Republicans proposed an alternative that would give a
portion of the NEA's money to the states for their distribution to
the arts.
   Williams said he was cancelling a subcommittee vote on the bill
that had been scheduled for next week until he meets with arts
supporters.
   ``I'd be surprised if they came out with a recommendation that
said all is well,'' Williams said.

<HEAD>Radical Students Clash With Police on Eve of Aniniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students hurling rocks and
firebombs fought police in Kwangju and a dozen other cities
Thursday, the eve of the 10th anniversary of a bloody
anti-government rebellion in Kwangju.
   Meanwhile, 27,000 workers at the nation's largest car plant
continued a strike for a third day.
   The nation's 130,000-strong police force was on top alert after
a major dissident coalition called for nationwide anti-government
protests to mark the Kwangju anniversary Friday.
   At least 200 people died and more than 1,700 were injured when
troops and tanks crushed a May 18, 1980 uprising in the southern
city.
   The Munhwa Broadcasting Co. said 20,000 students joined in
protests on 50 campuses Thursday. Police reported arrests and
injuries but gave no figures. The national Yonhap News Agency said
10 people were injured in one clash south of Seoul.
   In Kwangju, 155 miles south of Seoul, tension mounted as radical
students and dissidents prepared to mark the uprising.
   American residents and travelers in Kwangju said the U.S.
Embassy in Seoul advised them to stay off certain streets.
   The dissident People's Alliance announced in Seoul that it would
organize protests in several cities. The alliance was a major force
behind nationwide protests on May 9 that were the largest and most
violent since 1987.
   Radicals and dissidents want the ouster of President Roh
Tae-woo. They say the merger of his governing party with two
opposition groups into the new Democratic Liberal Party earlier
this year was a political coup and marks a return to dictatorial
rule in South Korea.
   In Kwangju, about 1,000 students clashed with riot police around
Chonnam University, hurling rocks and firebombs.
   Police fired barrages of tear gas from two armored vans, sending
clouds of the choking gas billowing over the school's main gate.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted as they charged
police in a steady rain. ``Drive out Yankees!''
   During a campus rally before the clash, students charged that
the United States took a bystander's role during the 10-day Kwangju
revolt, thus condoning the crackdown by Korean soldiers.
   A huge placard showed a Korean student ripping apart a U.S.
flag. An American flag was painted on a school's road so people
could walk on it.
   About 7,500 combat-clad riot police were deployed in Kwangju.
The massive show of force, along with steady downpours throughout
Thursday, apparently kept protests down.
   In the southeastern industrial town of Ulsan, meanwhile, 27,000
assembly workers of the Hyundai Motor Co. stayed away again
Thursday. They halted production at the nation's largest car marker
on Tuesday.
   The plant, a subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, makes 2,650
vehicles a day and sold 589,000 cars last year, including 200,000
in the United States and other nations.
   Hyundai workers went on strike after talks on a new contract
failed to make progress. Union officials reported ``some progress''
in marathon talks but said both sides were still apart over some
key issues, including a shorter work week and more benefits.

   Gerard Depardieu, star of the European blockbuster
film ``Cyrano,'' will travel to Moscow next month to promote the
movie featuring what some critics say is his best performance.
   ``Cyrano'' is vying for the coveted Gold Palm award at this
year's Cannes Film Festival. It stars Depardieu as the long-nosed
dreamer who breathes his passion and poetry into the empty head of
a simple soldier to woo the beautiful Roxanne.
   At a cost of about $19 million, ``Cyrano'' is France's most
expensive cinema production. It was Depardieu's 60th film role and
has been called his strongest work by many critics.
   The film adapted from Edmond Rostand's theater classic was
directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau.
   Depardieu will be accompanied by Theirry de Beauce, secretary of
state in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and will also travel to
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, where the movie was filmed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of medical, pharmaceutical and legal
experts began Thursday examining the Food and Drug Administration
with an eye toward revitalizing an agency often embroiled in
controversy.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told the
15-member panel, which he appointed, to ``consider whether FDA's
energies and resources are focused on the right objectives.''
   Sullivan said the FDA, which regulates about 25 percent of
products sold to consumers, has been under pressure in recent years
``to do more and more with less and less.''
   ``Since 1979, Congress has passed 21 bills giving the agency
more tasks, each of which added to the agency's mandate,'' he said.
   The FDA staffing level has fallen from 8,089 employees in 1980
to 7,877 this year.
   Also, 506 employees currently work solely on AIDS-related
projects. None did 10 years ago. Staffing in the generic drug
division, which had 120 employees a decade ago, has risen to 430.
Most of the additional staff there was added because of the recent
generic-drug corruption scandal.
   FDA Acting Commissioner James Benson said that because of the
nature of the agency's work, ``We'll always be in the middle of
some kind of controversy.''
   The FDA regulates the quality of most of the nation's foods and
food additives as well as prescription and over-the-counter drugs,
medical devices and cosmetics.
   The agency's budget this year is $587 million and a $13 million
supplemental appropriation is pending in Congress.
   The FDA ended up in the eye of the storm when it removed Chilean
fruit from store shelves after a poisoning threat last year. It is
often attacked by AIDS activists who claim the agency moves too
slowly in approving new drugs. The FDA also has been under fire for
its handling of generic drugs.
   The advisory committee's formation was announced last December,
shortly after then-FDA Commissioner Frank Young left to become a
deputy assistant secretary for health.
   Sources said at the time that Young was forced out, in part,
because of the generic drug scandal that has resulted so far in 13
criminal convictions on charges ranging from bribery to
racketeering. Those charged include generic drug companies, their
executives and FDA employees.
   The FDA advisory committee is headed by Dr. Charles C. Edwards,
a former FDA commissioner. Four other members of the panel are
former FDA officials.
   Sullivan told the committee members to submit a preliminary
report in four months and a final report one year from now.

   In a major breakthrough in the Baltic impasse,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met today with an official of
Lithuania's government for the first time since the republic
declared independence.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene talked with
Gorbachev for two hours in the Kremlin in what she called ``an
introduction to coming negotiations,'' a Lithuanian spokesman said.
   The meeting was an unexpected breakthrough in the dispute
between the Kremlin and Lithuania that flared on March 11 when the
Baltic republic of 3.8 million people declared independence.
Earlier today, Gorbachev lashed out at Lithuanian leaders,
characterizing their actions as ``adventurism.''
   Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania rescind the declaration.
The Lithuanian government has refused, but on Wednesday its Supreme
Council parliament offered to suspend laws passed since
independence if the Kremlin will open talks on its declaration of
secession.
   Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who also attended,
told Mrs. Prunskiene the offer did not address their main concern:
that the Lithuanian declaration of independence be suspended, the
Tass news agency reported.
   ``K. Prunskiene's attention was drawn to the indispensable
necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet cancel _ or as a
minimum, suspend _ this act and all the legislative measures
following it that contradict the Soviet Constitution,'' Tass
reported. It said the leaders told Mrs. Prunskiene that concession
was the only way to launch negotiations.
   But Tass said the leaders noted the Lithuanian offer showed that
``certain steps had been made toward the normalization of the
situation,'' Tass said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene called the meeting ``an introduction to coming
negotiations,'' Longinas Vasiliauskas, press attache of the
Lithuanian representation in Moscow, said. He said the prime
minister would not report in detail on the meeting until Friday.
Tass said Mrs. Prunskiene promised to report what had been said to
the Lithuanian Supreme Council parliament.
   Mrs. Prunskiene arrived in Moscow earlier today seeking to meet
with Gorbachev, who has imposed a partial economic embargo on
Lithuania in an effort to make it rescind independence laws it has
passed.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania was willing to suspend its drive
for independence and remain part of the Soviet security system.
   Shortly before her arrival, Gorbachev told Western reporters who
questioned him about the Baltics: ``I believe that the Lithuanian
leadership and some others cannot get rid of adventurism.''
   Asked whether he was aware that Mrs. Prunskiene was in Moscow
seeking to present new concessions, he said: ``I have received no
such request.''
   When Gorbachev was asked if he was willing to meet with leaders
from the breakaway Baltic republics, he looked one reporter in the
eye, then turned away and told his body guards, ``Let's move on.''
   In an interview with Britain's Channel Four television,
Gorbachev was highly critical of the Lithuanians.
   ``A constructive approach is needed. We will not permit any
violation of the constitution or any division from the
constitutional process,'' he said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene also said she was seeking to meet Secretary of
State James A. Baker III. Baker, who is in Moscow for meetings with
the Soviet leadership about the superpower summit at the end of the
month.
   She told reporters she had a ``tentative'' appointment with
Baker but had received no answer from Gorbachev.
   Baker said he would press Soviet leaders to explain why they
have not begun talks with Baltic leaders. ``It's not encouraging to
us to see the absence of a dialogue between leaders there and the
Kremlin,'' said Baker.
   In Washington, President Bush said the standoff between Moscow
and the Baltic republics ``certainly puts some tension'' on the
planned summit.

<HEAD>Shamirs Gets Three-Week Extension on Mandate to Form Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir received a 21-day
extension Thursday on his mandate to form Israel's new government
and immediately ran into trouble with potential coalition partners.
   Shamir, whose mandate was due to expire Friday, was granted the
extension by President Chaim Herzog.
   ``I hope I would not need all that period and would finish with
it before it expires. I don't want to name a date, but I hope it
would be soon,'' Shamir told reporters outside Herzog's residence.
   Under Israeli law, a legislator entrusted by the president with
forming a government is initially given three weeks and then may
ask for an additional 21 days. No president has ever rejected a
request for an extension.
   Shamir indicated he asked for extra time because of disputes
with potential partners over the distribution of Cabinet posts as
well as over the next government's guidelines.
   ``Each party has its aspirations and demands, and I have to
worry about the overall picture,'' he said.
   Shamir, head of the hard-line Likud bloc, has tentative
agreements that would give him a majority in the 120-member
parliament. But he has been unable to sign pacts with three
ultra-right parties and three Orthodox religious factions.
   The right-wing Tehiya party announced Thusday it would not join
his government because of Likud's failure to meet party demands for
government posts.
   The radical right-wing Moledet, meanwhile, said its ideological
differences with Likud could not be bridged. The party advocates
expulsion of Arabs from the occupied territories and opposes
Shamir's plan of granting Palestinians limited autonomy.
   Israel has been governed by Shamir's 13-member transition
Cabinet since March 15, when the left-leaning Labor Party
engineered the collapse of Likud-Labor coalition over Shamir's
refusal to accept U.S. proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue in Cairo.
   Herzog first asked Labor leader Shimon Peres to try to form a
government. Peres failed after five weeks and was forced to hand
the mandate to Shamir on April 26.
   At the time, Likud signed a coalition accord with a four-member
faction headed by Yitzhak Modai, a former finance minister. The
group had vacillated between the two rival camps for weeks.
   A second agreement was signed with Eliezer Mizrahi, a defector
from the Agudat Israel ultra-Orthodox party which backs Labor but
now appears willing to consider a partnership with Likud. Mizrahi's
move to Likud robbed Peres of the majority he needed to form a
government.
   Shamir still needs to pin down formal pledges of backing from
three religious parties and three ultra-rightist factions, among
them Tehiya and Moledet, to assure himself of a 61-seat majority.
   Despite the entangled coalition negotiations with small parties,
Shamir ruled out a new alliance with Labor.
   ``I did not discuss this possibility with Mr. Peres and I think
it is not realistic today,'' he said.
   In other developments, Labor announced it would delay by 10 days
the publication of an internal report placing blame for the party's
poor showing in the 1988 parliament elections and 1989 municipal
balloting.
   The report, which reportedly criticizes Peres, was to have been
published Thursday. It is expected to boost the campaign by former
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to oust Peres as party boss.

<HEAD>Panel Calls For Excluder Devices On Trawlers To Save Endangered
Sea Turtles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel said Thursday that between 11,000 and
44,000 sea turtles drown annually in shrimp nets and recommended
that virtually all trawlers be required to use turtle-excluder
devices for most of each year.
   Incidental capture and drowning in shrimp trawler nets
``accounts for more deaths than all other human activities
combined'' among the five endangered species of sea turtles that
live in the U.S. waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico,
the National Research Council committee said.
   Though many studies estimated that 11,000 loggerhead and Kemp's
ridley turtles are killed annually by shrimp fishing, the report
said that figure ``was judged by this committee to be an
underestimate, possibly by as much as a factor of four.'' Other
estimates by the committee put the number of turtles killed by
shrimping each year at 55,000.
   A halt to shrimp trawling altogether could be required to
preserve the sea turtle species, the report said, unless the
industry takes vigorous measures to limit the number of turtles
killed.
   ``The committee believes that shrimping with adequate controls
is compatible with the recovery of turtle populations,'' the report
said. ``Although prohibition of shrimp trawling might be required
as a `last ditch' measure,'' the committee said the use of new
technology could reduce turtle deaths ``to a level that the
populations can tolerate.''
   The committee said that the population Kemp's ridley turtles
``is dangerously small,'' about 1 percent of the abundance found in
a 1947 study. Since 1978, the number of nesting females, the study
said, has dropped from 700 to 350. Adult Kemp's ridley turtles live
principally in the Gulf of Mexico and nest on beaches in Mexico.
   Loggerhead turtles nesting on South Carolina and Georgia beaches
are in decline, the study said, but are stable or increasing in
some Florida areas.
   Nestings of the other species, green turtles, hawksbills, and
leatherbacks, seem to be stable or increasing slightly in some
areas, the report said.
   The committee said that other human activity also kills many
adult sea turtles, but nothing is as lethal to the species as
shrimping.
   Other types of commercial fishing, the report, said kills about
550 turtles annually. An estimated 400 turtles die from collisions
with boats, while others die from dredging and the removal of old
oil rigs. An unknown number of turtles, the committee said, die
from swallowing discarded plastic debris, which some turtles
confuse with natural food.
   Environmental groups, which have been battling to protect sea
turtles, hailed the report as a verification of the need to take
strong measures.
   ``The report confirms what other studies and assessments have
found in the past and what we have been arguing for the last 10
years,'' said Michael Weber of the Center for Marine Conservation.
``Capturing sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a major threat to their
population in the United States.''
   Congress requested the 1988 NRC study after passage of amendment
to the Endangered Species Act. Some congressmen from Gulf states
complained about federal regulations that required shrimpers to use
net devices that are designed to prevent sea turtles from drowning.
   The report said the turtles drown when they are caught in a
funnel-shaped net commonly dragged behind boats to capture shrimp
that live near the ocean floor.
   Turtle excluder devices, or TEDs, are, in effect, trapdoors in
the bottom of the nets that allow turtles to escape before they
drown.
   Federal law now requires shrimpers to use TEDs while fishing
from May 1 to Aug. 31 along the southern Atlantic Ocean coast, and
from March 1 to Nov. 30 in the Gulf of Mexico. The NRS report said
that the use of TEDs at all times in all areas could reduce the
capture of turtles to about 3 percent of the rate that occurs
without TEDs.
   The report said that turtle survival rates also would improve if
nets were not towed for longer than 40 minutes in the summer and 60
minutes in the winter _ the approximate length of time a sea turtle
can stay underwater without injury.
   The NRC also called for protection of turtle nesting areas and
recommended that a small-scale captive breeding program continue
for Kemp's ridley turtles.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Hears Adams' Plan To Clean Up Nuclear Weapons Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should set up a special trust fund to
guarantee availability of more than $100 billion for cleaning up
radioactive wastes at nuclear weapons plants, a Senate panel was
told Thursday.
   The Energy Department opposes the fund, proposed by Sen. Brock
Adams and Rep. Norm Dicks, both Washington State Democrats. The
department claims it would duplicate clean-up plans initiated by
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   But on Thursday, Sens. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., and Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, joined an aide to Washington Gov. Booth Gardner
in pleading for the fund before the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee.
   They said a permanent financing plan is necessary to guard
against future administrations that may lack a commitment to health
and environmental safety.
   ``We can't continue to push this problem off to future
generations as it has been pushed off on us,'' said Dan Silver, a
special assistant to Gardner.
   ``We're fooling ourselves if we think we can continue in a
nickel-and-dime fashion to try to clean up these places without a
long-term commitment,'' Wirth added. ``We are going to have to find
a way of raising the ante significantly.''
   Adams said Watkins had made great strides in launching the
clean-up of waste sites, but he said the public remains skeptical
about the commitment to provide the huge amounts of money necessary.
   ``We must create a program so we don't run the risk of a
different secretary or a different administration deciding that we
can let this go for awhile,'' he said.
   The trust fund would be created with an appropriation of about
$6.2 billion over the next two years. The money would be in lieu of
an approximately equal amount regularly appropriated to DOE for
environmental activities, Adams said. The fund would be sustained
by assessments to commercial users of DOE nuclear facilties and
polluters.
   Leo Duffy, director of the Energy Department's Office of
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management, said the proposal
would ``complicate present budgeting requirements.''

   Rail workers nationwide stopped selling

   The 30-minute strikes were the latest in a series of worker
demonstrations in recent weeks fueled by frustration over the
possible effects on jobs and prices of unification with West
Germany.
   They came on the eve of the signing of a treaty by German
leaders that will merge the countries' economies July 2, a major
step to full unification.
   In Washington, President Bush met Thursday with West Germany
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and voiced strong support for a united
Germany with ``full control over all its territory.''
   The East German government news service, ADN, said workers
paralyzed main rail routes nationwide, stopping work at switching
yards, ticket counters and on trains.
   The so-called ``warning strikes'' were staged to protest what
workers said was the failure of the government railroad company to
meet demands for higher wages and job protection.
   Train traffic, a principal form of daily transportation for many
East Germans, was interrupted in the cities of Magdeburg, Rostock,
Gera, Schwerin and others, ADN said.
   Last week, farmers, teachers and textile workers held nationwide
strikes to protest unemployment expected as East Germany moves to a
free market.
   Workers are seeking protection from joblessness and from the
better-made Western imports already flooding the country. Many
outmoded East German businesses are expected to fail in the first
two years of economic unification.
   East Germans also are demanding higher wages to cope with the
price increases expected when costs are set by the free market.
   The strikes were held during the weekly session of Parliament,
which debated the draft of a new constitution that will take old
Socialist laws off the books and establish East Germany legally as
a democracy.
   It also would eliminate the old Communist guarantee of full
unemployment.
   Liberal lawmakers pressed for some employment guarantees in the
new democratic charter.
   Wolfgang Ullmann, a lawmaker from a left-leaning opposition
coalition, called it a ``scandalous copy'' for ``would-be West
German citizens.''
   He called for a new constitution that guarantees workers' rights
and warned of ``mass unemployment'' and a ``merciless economic
war.''
   Conservatives say the conversion to a free market and an
increase in Western investment will eventually raise living
standards and provide jobs.
   The economic treaty is to be signed Friday by Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere and Kohl. The parliaments of the two nations
likely will consider it in June.
   A full political merger is not expected until next year.
   The centerpiece of the economic treaty is the circulation of
West German marks as the official currency of East Germany.
   However, the treaty leaves out how to shift East Germany's
publicly owned industries and property to the private sector, to be
the subject of further talks. Some East Germans fear West German
investors will buy up the nation.
   Kohl wants Western investors to have an incentive for investing
in East Germany's moribund industrial sector, while de Maiziere
wants some limits on how much property West Germans can own.
   Western businesses already are forging deals with East German
enterprises, and Western products are increasingly available in
East Germany.
   On Thursday, the West German subsidiary of the giant American
cigarette maker, Philip Morris, agreed to buy a cigarette plant in
the East German city of Dresden, according to a report by ADN.
   American cigarette makers have inundated East Germany with
advertising in recent months in an effort to tap the market in this
nation of heavy smokers.
   Also Thursday, the U.S.-based computer manufacturer
International Business Machine and a government-run data processing
enterprise announced a cooperative agreement, ADN said.
   The accord to develop software, sales and service will result in
higher quality for the East German firm, ADN quoted Guenter Rose,
head of the East German Data Processing Center, as saying.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Bush said a reunified Germany should
``have full control over all of its territory without any new,
discriminatory constraints on German sovereignty.''
   He also reiterated that a united Germany should be part of NATO.
   ``We both want a united Germany which enjoys full sovereignty, a
united Germany which is a full member of the Western community and
of the NATO alliance,'' he said.
   Although the United States, Britain and France say Germany
should join the Western alliance, the Soviet Union, the fourth
World War II victor, has said it should remain neutral or a member
of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Task Force Says $100 Million Should be Spent on
HDTV</HEAD>

   A Pentagon task force is recommending that the
government spend $100 million a year to develop advanced video
systems such as high-definition TV, a published report said
Thursday.
   That would be a 10-fold increase over what the Pentagon agency
charged with HDTV development sought and received this year for
advanced TV research.
   The High-Resolution Systems Task Force has forwarded the $100
million recommendation to the Defense Science Board, which will
discuss the proposal next week, according to the Washington-based
trade publication Communications Daily.
   A task force spokeswoman, Susan Hansen, said Thursday she could
not confirm the $100 million figure. She said the task force
recommendations were under review and would be considered by the
board.
   The recommendations, she said, could be discussed at the board's
quarterly meeting next week. The board _ made up chiefly of
business executives, educators and retired military personnel _
reports to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Proponents of HDTV, which promises motion-picture-quality images
and compact-disc-quality sound, say it could help re-energize the
U.S. electronics and computer industries. But others say HDTV won't
be a popular consumer item until well into the next century.
   The Pentagon foresees military applications in radar and other
display-type technologies and has funded a modest research program
through DAPRA, its Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, which
also funds the Sematech semicondutor consortium.
   White House officials such as Budget Director Richard Darman
reportedly have opposed efforts to single out private industries
for government aid.
   Concern over using federal funds to support so-called dual use _
military and civilian _ technologies led to the recent reassignment
of DAPRA's director, Craig Fields, according to administration
critics such as House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and
Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   An aide to Levine, Jon Cowan, said the task force recommendation
was an ``important first step, but just a drop in the bucket''
compared with what the Europeans and Japanese already have spent on
HDTV development.
   Europe Eureka consortium has spent between $300 million and $400
million on HDTV, while Japan has spent about $1 billion, Cowan said.
   ``It's upping the ante,'' Cowan said.
   DAPRA spent $5 million in 1989 to fund research into
high-definition displays, spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said Thursday.
The agency requested and received $10 million for 1990 and has
requested $12 million for 1991, she said.
   The agency has awarded several contracts to companies developing
high-definition display technology, although some news reports have
said the administration would not fund some of these awards.
   Congress appropriated an additional $20 million to DARPA for
1990, but the money can't be used until the agency tells Congress,
among other things, how it intends to spend the funds.
   Cowan said the stipulation gives the administration an excuse
not to spend the money.
   He said Levine and others were drafting a bill requiring that
all programs funded through DARPA would be for military and
civilian uses.

<TEXT>
   A sculpture by Soviet artist Zurab Tsereteli was
unveiled on a busy corner in London's financial district Thursday,
and the proud sculptor proclaimed: ``We have stormed the citadel of
capitalism.
   His 6-foot-high bronze sculpture, titled ``Break the Wall of
Distrust,'' depicts a young man breaching a wall. It was placed on
Cannon Street, between St. Paul's Cathedral and the Bank of England.
   Tsereteli, from Tbilisi, Georgia is widely acknowledged as the
leading Soviet sculptor. He said he sketched the design for the
piece two weeks before the Berlin Wall was broken Nov. 9, 1989.
   ``I think people of talent and culture pick up a sense of what's
in the air before the rest of us,'' said a beaming Trevor Osborne,
chairman of developers Speyhawk PLC, who commissioned the work for
the corner of a new office block rented to a Dutch bank.
   ``To see a sculpture by a Soviet artist in the heart of the City
of London is a novel development and a sign of the times, a sign of
the great and positive changes in Europe,'' Leonid Zamyatin, Soviet
ambassador in London, told a small gathering.
   Zamyatin said he brought greetings to the ceremony from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, a Georgian like the sculptor.
   ``Shevardnadze said he hopes this will be called Tbilisi
Corner,'' Zamyatin said with a smile.
   At the edge of the sidewalk, travelers in a red double-decker
bus halted among taxis, trucks, vans and a Rolls-Royce, gazed out
the windows at the crowd on the corner while messengers on
motorcycles skittered in and out and a jack hammer drilled close by.
   Richard Luce, arts minister in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's business-oriented Conservative government, called it an
honor and a privilege to unveil the sculpture.
   ``Millions of people sitting for hours in the London traffic
will have the opportunity to look at it,'' he said.
   `I have been to Tbilisi, which is a wonderful city in a
wonderful country. The timing by Speyhawk is quite brilliant. There
are few better ways of developing better relations than through art
and culture,'' Luce said.
   Osborne was looking for a sculptor to decorate his new building
when he was introduced to Tsereteli by Connie Middleton, who had
met the artist in Tbilisi while arranging the first British auction
of contemporary Soviet art.
   ``I signed the contract with the sculptor in my house on October
27, 1989, and I was amazed when the Berlin Wall was knocked down
two weeks later,'' Osborne said.
   The new sculpture is Tsereteli's first in Britain. His works are
on show throughout his native Caucasus and on Soviet Embassy and
consulate buildings in Japan, Brazil and the United States.

<HEAD>Henson's Death Leaves Muppet Voice Void</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Jim Henson left a chasm on Sesame
Street and beyond. It also left questions about who would do the
voices of Kermit the Frog and other beloved Muppet characters.
   Henson, 53, died Wednesday of multi-organ failure brought on by
complications from galloping pneumonia, said Dr. David M. Gelmont,
who treated Henson at New York Hospital.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Monday at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine, said Susan Berry, a spokeswoman for Jim Henson
Productions.
   It was unclear what affect Henson's death would have on the
program, which is produced by the Children's Television Workshop.
   After Mel Blanc died on July 10, 1989, his son, Noel, took over
the voices of Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and other Warner Bros.
characters.
   Henson and with his wife, Jane, had five children who range from
age 19 to 30.
   Lisa Simon, who produces Sesame Street, said it wasn't
immediately known what would become of the voices of Kermit; Ernie,
the smiling humanoid devoted to his rubber duckie; and Guy Smiley,
``America's favorite game show host.''
   Henson always did those voices and had no substitute.
   It also wasn't known whether Henson's death _ or any new voices
for the characters _ would be explained to the children who watch
the show.
   ``We're just dealing with shock of Jim's death,'' said Simon.
   In 1982, Will Lee, the actor who played the kindly shopkeeper
Mr. Hooper, died at age 74. The next season, young viewers were
told about Mr. Hooper's death.
   Viewers got the news on the Thanksgiving program, chosen because
parents were likely to be with their children then to answer
questions.
   In a four-minute segment, players on the program explained the
death to Big Bird, who bought birdseed milkshakes from Mr. Hooper's
store.
   ``Just because,'' he was told.
   Another human character, David, said he had taken over the store
and would be providing Big Bird's beverages.
   At the end of the segment, Big Bird hung a drawing of Mr. Hooper
over his nest _ and viewers were told that a baby had been born to
a human couple on the program.
   ``That's the amazing thing about babies,'' said Big Bird. ``One
minute they're not here, the next minute they are.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 countries. It has been estimated that about half of
all American children between ages 3 and 5 watch the show.
   The show is shot from September through January, and the 22nd
season begins airing next January.
   ``That gives us the opportunity to catch our breath and see
where we're going to go from here,'' said Simon. ``There are a lot
of characters on the show other than Jim's characters.''
   A Walt Disney Co. spokesman said despite Henson's death, Ponce
D. Lion and other Muppets will still get a series on the Disney
Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be produced as
planned.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the company purchased
rights to use Muppet characters in its theme parks, movies, TV
shows and retail products.

   A shortage of nurses is hurting the quality of
care for patients in the nation's hospitals, according to a
readership survey released Thursday by the Federation of Nurses and
Health Professionals.
   Ninety percent of the 1,304 nurses who responded said the
shortage is a problem where they work. Nearly three out of four
said it has harmed the quality of patient care at their facility,
federation officials said.
   ``They can't get into rooms to take care of patients as fast as
they need to,'' because of their patient load and a growing number
of non-nursing duties, said Candice Owley, federation vice
president.
   ``They are more apt to make medication errors and other
errors,'' in part because they are working long hours because of
overtime demands, she said.
   Owley said she did not know of any deaths that had resulted
directly from the shortage, but she said the possibility was there.
   ``If you are not able to see a change in a monitor or that a
respirator is disconected, these patient's lives are on the line
and you have to be concerned that this is happening,'' she said.
   The survey was based on 1,582 responses to a questionnaire that
ran in the March issue of the federation's monthly newsletter,
Healthwire. Of those responding, 84 percent said they were nurses
registered nurses. The rest worked in other health-care jobs.
   The federation is a division of the American Federation of
Teachers. It represents 40,000 health care workers across the
country.
   Federation officials said they had no estimate on the number of
nurses needed to alleviate the shortage.
   The American Hospital Association said more than 10 percent of
the budgeted positions for registered nurses were vacant in
December 1988.
   About 1.5 milion registered nurses are employed, said Jewell
Gould, research director for the federation.
   He said Labor Department figures show that an additional 613,000
RNs will be needed by the turn of the century. The additional
nurses will be needed because there will be more elderly Americans
in the year 2000 than there are now, and they are more prone to
needing health care.

   Federal regulators said Thursday they have
fined a New York utility $75,000, more than the usual amount, for
inability to handle non-routine radioactivity brought to light when
a worker irradiated his thumb.
   The fine was imposed by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission against the New York Power Authority for an incident
March 8 at its J.A. Fitzpatrick nuclear plant in Oswego on the
shore of Lake Ontario that exposed three workers to radiation.
   The authority will not contest the penalty, said spokesman Carl
Patrick in New York City.
   The worker was using a radioactive tracer, sodium-24, to measure
water flow in a piping system, according to a commission
announcement.
   He became contaminated because he handled the cap on the tracer
container with his gloved hand instead of tongs or tweezers, then
took off the gloves. His left thumb touched the contaminated
gloves, exposing it to an estimated 48.8 rem.
   Federal regulations limit the exposure of bodily extremities to
18.75 rem every three months. A rem is a unit of radiation dose to
humans.
   Other workers became contaminated to an unspecified lesser
extent as they helped decontaminate the first worker, the
commission said.
   Plant managers did not adequately plan and supervise the job,
the commission announcement said.
   The March 8 and earlier incidents ``represent a breakdown in the
management control of the radiation safety program at your facility
and demonstrate the need for improved planning and control of
radiation protection activities, and particularly for those
activities involving non-routine, radiologically significant
tasks,'' Thomas T. Martin, the commission's regional administrator,
said in a letter to the authority.
   Patrick said the authority has begun to retrain workers and is
revising procedures for non-routine tasks.
   As for the other incidents, Patrick said another employee was
contaminated about two years ago when workers were cutting
radioactive materials underwater. A piece came out of the water and
the worker picked it up, Patrick said.
   Another exposure occurred when workers failed to notice a piece
of radioactive material had floated to the top of the fuel pool, he
said.

   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King
lashed out at congressional critics Thursday for unfairly depicting
Social Security as a ``stumbling, inept agency down on its knees.''
   ``It bothers me, and it's fair to say it bothers people at
Social Security, that we always seem to get dumped on and nobody
ever takes the time to say, `You know, that was a good job,''' Mrs.
King said.
   Mrs. King said she welcomed constructive criticism, but worried
that unfair reports would undermine confidence in Social Security.
   ``You're going to get people frightened and concerned about
whether the system is going to be there to serve them,'' she said.
``The impression left of a stumbling, inept agency down on its
knees is one that really does translate into a real problem for
people in the field.''
   She said she found it particularly galling that critics in
Congress have been soliciting horror stories from Social Security
caseworkers.
   ``You have to look at the big picture and not focus on all the
anecdotes that you can muster,'' Mrs. King said. ``Social Security
is, across the board, serving people, answering telephones,
handling problems and it's amazing to me how well they're doing.''
   Mrs. King's comments came in an interview with The Associated
Press a day before she was scheduled to testify before the Special
Senate Committee on Aging. It was to be another in a string of
congressional hearings on service problems at the Social Security
Administration.
   The agency, whose staff was slashed by 20 percent during the
Reagan administration, has been faulted for declining service,
providing inaccurate information and frequent busy signals on its
800-number telephone network.
   Mrs. King, who took over the agency in August, said her
frustration was aimed not only at Congress. She alluded to negative
media coverage of the agency and cited disgruntled employees who
come in ``with gripes and criticims that may have been relevant a
year ago.''
   ``From every sector you will find people zeroing in on a
microcosm of problems, anecdoctal in nature and certainly needing
fixing,'' Mrs. King said. ``While we care about every single person
... I do have to keep the big picture in mind.''
   Mrs. King said the agency had improved its operations over the
past year, sharply reduced the busy signals on its 800-number and
hired 500 workers to address staffing shortages. A study by the
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services
found a large majority of those surveyed found service helpful and
accurate, she said.
   Mrs. King invited her critics ``to be a part of the solution and
not just a part of the griping problem.''
   She criticized several legislative proposals, including a bill
to separate the Social Security Administration from the HHS. She
said another proposal to require that local Social Security phone
numbers, not just the 800-number, be listed in telephone books was
``specious'' and ``trite.''
   ``Surely the U.S. Congress has more important business to get
about,'' she said.

   The first of Manuel Noriega's co-defendants to be
punished in the drug smuggling case was sentenced Thursday to 30
months in prison, but may only have to serve 15 months.
   Panamanian pilot Eduardo Pardo has cooperated with the U.S.
attorney's office in its investigation of the deposed Panamanian
leader, and will continue to do so, his attorney told U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler.
   Pardo, 44, pleaded guilty in February to one count of illegal
travel for flying $800,000 in cocaine profits from Florida to
Panama in 1983.
   Pardo had faced a maximum five-year federal prison sentence and
a $10,000 fine.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan recommended leniency
for Pardo. He said the defendant had turned over evidence that
helped investigators track the movements of other co-defendants,
including his flight log.
   ``We intend to talk to him more,'' Sullivan said.
   Tears ran down Pardo's face as his attorney, William Meadows,
pleaded for probation. Pardo declined an opportunity to speak on
his own behalf.
   He pleaded guilty ``because he knew that he did something
wrong,'' Meadows said. ``He was deeply remorseful for it, and he
said he has not done anything similar before or since.''
   Meadows noted that Pardo had no previous criminal record and
surrendered voluntarily to U.S. authorities in Panama City
following the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.
   Under sentencing guidelines, Pardo would be freed in 20 months,
including five already served. But Hoeveler made a point of telling
Meadows he would welcome a motion to reduce the sentence if Pardo
continued cooperating with investigators.
   Outside the courtroom, Samuel Burstyn, attorney for co-defendant
Luis del Cid, said the sentence would keep Pardo in the United
States until after the Noriega trial planned for early next year.
   Burstyn said the sentence was ``obviously'' aimed at keeping
Pardo available to the government.
   The attorney also revealed that his client, who'd been
negotiating a plea bargain, has run into difficulties because
Panamanian authorities have said they will not necessarily accept
any agreement he makes with U.S. prosecutors.
   The attorney said he could not reach an agreement with federal
prosecutors ``only to have the Panamanians in their zeal seek to
extradite him.''
   Del Cid, a former top aide to Noriega, is considered the
highest-ranking defendant in custody after the former Panamanian
leader himself.
   Noriega, del Cid and Pardo are among 16 people indicted in Miami
in February 1988 on charges of taking part in a conspiracy that
made Panama a way station and processing center for Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel.
   Pardo and co-defendant Daniel Miranda flew a Lear jet fitted
with secret compartments to hide the money, Sullivan told the court
in February.
   Pardo received $40,000 for the flight and knew it was drug
money, the prosecutor said.
   If Pardo testifies for the prosecution, the defendant most
immediately threatened by Pardo would appear to be Miranda.
   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, has said his client didn't
know the money came from drugs, and that Pardo's guilty plea didn't
necessarily implicate his client.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the
cartel. The Panamanian leader surrendered to U.S. troops after the
invasion of his country.
   He and three of the other defendants are being held in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami. Miranda and Brian
Alden Davidow are out on bond.

<HEAD>Bush Meets Kohl, Says Germany Must Decide Own Future</HEAD>

   President Bush, completing a series of
pre-summit meetins with allied leaders, said Thursday a united
Germany must exercise full control over its territory and not be
``singled out'' by the Soviet Union for special status.
   Bush, commenting after a meeting with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, voiced strong opposition to a Soviet proposal that a
reunified Germany be neutral, or a member of both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   Kohl, too, said firmly that such matters were up to Germany
alone, and he said his nation's choice ``is and will always be''
NATO.
   It was Bush's final meeting with Western leaders in advance of
his May 31-June 3 summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In recent weeks, Bush also met with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Canadian President Brian Mulroney.
   The issue of German reunification is expected to be high on the
agenda at the Bush-Gorbachev talks.
   ``Forty-five years after the end of the war, there is no reason
that a unified Democratic Germany should be in any way singled out
for some special status,'' Bush said outside the White House as he
bade farewell to Kohl.
   For his part, Kohl thanked Bush for the ``magnificent support''
he had given ``Germans on our path to German unity.''
   In their formal remarks, neither Bush nor Kohl mentioned the
delicate question of the pace of German reunification.
   At picture-taking session in the Oval Office, Kohl would not
predict whether German unity would come before the end of the year
_ even though earlier he suggested all-German elections could come
as early as Dec. 2.
   ``Nobody knows that. We know that the people are shouting, `we
are the people.' This is why nobody can fix an exact date. But
everything's going very well. We can say that,'' he said through a
translator.
   Losses by Kohl's Christian Democratic Party in two West German
state elections on Sunday have seen as a reflection of voter
uneasiness over his plans for speedy reunification.
   Bush administration officials say question of how quickly
reunification proceeds is a matter to be left strictly up to the
Germans.
   Bush said that he and Kohl both agreed that the rights of the
four World War II victors _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
France and Britain _ should be terminated at the time of German
reunification.
   ``A united Germany should have full control over all of its
territory without any new, discriminatory constraints on German
sovereignty,'' Bush said.
   Britain, France and the United States support West Germany's
call for a reunified Germany to be part of NATO. But the Soviet
Union argues that the new Germany should be neutral, or a member of
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Both the United States and West Germany ``want a united Germany
which enjoys full sovereignty, a united Germany which is a full
member of the Western community and of the NATO alliance, including
participation in its integrated military structures,'' Bush said.
   A senior administration official, insisting upon anonymity, said
of the West Germans at a White House briefing after the Kohl visit,
``It's absolutely critical ... that we keep in the closest possible
touch with them and that was what this meeting was about _
especially immediately in advance of a U.S.-Soviet summit in which
the future of Germany will figure prominently.''
   In his remarks on the South Lawn of the White House, Bush said
he and Kohl agreed that U.S. forces should ``remain stationed in
the united Germany and elsewhere in Europe to continue to promote
stability and security.''
   Kohl said a reunified Germany must remain a member of NATO _ but
he urged that the alliance concentrate more in the future on its
political role rather than its military one.
   ``As the threat is decreasing appreciably, the alliance must
keep the initiative in the field of disarmament and arms control
and review its strategy and structure accordingly,'' he said.
   He said at a news conference later, ``We do not want a future
Germany to have a diminished sovereignty. We do not want any
singularization, neutralization or demilitarization of Germany. We
do not want a united Germany to be nonaligned, to drift between the
two camps.''
   Bush and Kohl met privately for an hour, then for another two
and a half hours with aides.
   During the Oval Office picture-taking session, Kohl praised Bush.
   ``I think it's been rare to find a president in the history of
the United States who knows German history and German politics so
well as this president. And European politics,'' he said.
   ``And that of course is a lucky thing for us. And I think that
you should write that,'' Kohl told reporters.
   ``So do I,'' Bush chimed in.
   Bush and Kohl also discussed arms control, troops in Europe and
the situation in the rebellious Soviet republics of Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia, aides said.

<HEAD>Texas Lawmakers List Top 10 Reasons Letterman Should Come to
Austin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borrowing a gimmick from David Letterman's
late-night TV show, legislators adopted a resolution Thursday
listing 10 reasons why he should broadcast live from Austin to
celebrate a theater's 75th anniversary.
   A regular feature on ``Late Night with David Letterman'' is a
top 10 list, read in reverse order, spoofing various topics.
   The Texas House list reads:
   ``10. The governor has promised that Mr. Letterman will not be
executed during his visit to our state.
   ``9. No women in Austin currently claim to be married to or even
a little bit interested in Mr. Letterman.
   ``8. No celebrity of Mr. Letterman's magnitude has visited
Austin since 1966 when Burgess Meredith arrived in his private
Penguin Plane for the world premier of the original Batman movie.
   ``7. We could have asked Katharine Hepburn to come, but she
would have turned us down flat.
   ``6. A psychic channeler has determined that Mr. Letterman is
the unwitting host for the spirit of our late President Lyndon
Baines Johnson and that the oil bust will not be over until Dave
brings Lyndon home.
   ``5. A cowboy hat is the only headgear that can fully conceal
those pesky defects in Mr. Letterman's coiffure.
   ``4. The Texas National Guard has agreed to keep Cher and
Shirley MacLaine outside the city limits during Mr. Letterman's
stay, using excessive force if necessary.
   ``3. Mr. Letterman will not be required to participate in
Spam-A-Rama, Austin's annual tribute to a certain nationally known
pink rubberized food product.
   ``2. During his visit, the city's 750,000 resident bats will
perform the world's largest stupid urban bat colony trick by
recreating the astrological sign of Mr. Letterman's choice in the
skies above Austin.
   ``1. Throughout his stay, Mr. Letterman will be officially
addressed by all Texans as `The Great White Enchilada From
Somewhere South of Poughkeepsie.'''
   The resolution by Rep. Terral Smith invites Letterman to be the
Legislature's ``honored guest'' for the Paramount Theatre's 75th
anniversary.

<HEAD>Zumwalt Says Much More Defoliant Sprayed Than Recorded</HEAD>

   More Agent Orange was sprayed in Vietnam than
official records show, a former commander said in a report Thursday
that also suggests ``a discernible pattern, if not collaboration,''
to deny veterans compensation.
   Also, a Veterans Affairs Department panel issued a ruling that
brings compensation closer to veterans exposed to the herbicide who
suffer from soft-tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer.
   Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., in his report to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski, said he was certain from his experience that
more Agent Orange was spread than recorded.
   ``Combat units ... frequently conducted `unofficial' sprayings
of Agent Orange obtained from out of channel, and thus unrecorded
sources.'' said Zumwalt.
   ``Additionally, as commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Vietnam, I was
aware that Agent Orange issued to Allied forces was frequently used
on unrecorded missions,'' Zumwalt said in the report.
   The report, issued May 6, was released Thursday, a day after
Zumwalt told an advisory panel to the VA he believes that 28
diseases are linked to Agent Orange exposure. Zumwalt, a special
adviser to Derwinski, was recently named to the department's
Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards.
   The panel on Thursday determined it is as likely as not that a
significant association exists between soft-tissue sarcoma and
Agent Orange exposure.
   Derwinski is to decide by June whether to award disability
payments to veterans with that disease. Derwinski decided in March
that all Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should be
compensated.
   The advisory committee in August will examine studies relating
dioxin and herbicide exposure to a skin disease known as chloracne,
and a metabolic disorder known as porphyrea cutanea tarda.
   The two reports make it likely that veterans will be compensated
for soft-tissue sarcoma. VA spokesman Bonner Day said the
department had no figure on how many Agent Orange claimants said
they have soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Zumwalt's report said the herbicide was used in strengths far in
excess of that suggested by the manufacturers. The makers have
settled a class-action lawsuit brought by afflicted veterans.
   He also criticizes government actions and studies on Agent
Orange, including the activities of the advisory panel.
   His broadsides backed up claims by veterans who have been trying
to get compensation for more than a decade and who claim the
government has had to be pushed to move and has ignored evidence
supporting links between Agent Orange and cancers.
   ``Were the faulty conclusions, faulty methodology and noticeable
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem, correcting the
misdirection would be more manageable,'' Zumwalt wrote.
   ``But, experience with other governmental agencies responsible
for ... analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to Agent
Orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern, if not outright
governmental collaboration, to deny compensation to Vietnam
veterans for disabilities associated with exposure to dioxin.''
   Committee chairman Oliver Meadows said he would not comment on
the Zumwalt report.
   Zumwalt ordered the spraying of the defoliant in Vietnam and
lost a son, a Vietnam veteran, to a cancer linked to Agent Orange
exposure.
   About 12 million gallons of the herbicide, which contained
cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed from 1965 to 1970, according to
records.
   Zumwalt said, however, ``a significant, if not major source of
exposure was from non-recorded, non-Ranch Hand operations.'' Ranch
Hand was the name for the aircraft spraying operation.
   ``Evidence readily suggests that at the time experts knew that
Agent Orange was harmful to military personnel,'' he said.
   Zumwalt said that in addition to removing enemy cover and
destroying crops, the herbicide was sprayed to clear vegetation
around military installations, landing zones, fire base camps and
trails.

   Sens. Edward Kennedy and Paul Simon introduced
a bill Thursday that would grant statehood to the District of
Columbia, beginning what Kennedy predicted would be ``a difficult
uphill struggle.''
   ``The measure we are introducing is not new, but it is
overdue,'' said Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who backed two
previous statehood bills that died without votes being taken.
   ``No one doubts this will be a difficult uphill struggle, but we
are committed to the effort,'' he said.
   Jesse Jackson, an ardent advocate of statehood, joined Kennedy
and Simon, an Illinois Democrat, at a news conference announcing
the bill.
   Mayor Marion Barry did not attend. Barry is scheduled to go on
trial next month on charges of drug possession and perjury.
   Kennedy, referring to President Bush's recent suggestion that
the city could be given the compromise benefit of voting rights in
Congress, said statehood was the only acceptable goal.
   ``Part-way measures and half-hearted initiatives do not satisfy
the basic principle of self-determination,'' Kennedy said. ``The
people of the District of Columbia deserve their full rights.''
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, who has introduced similar legislation in
the House, said the city's negative image would hurt the statehood
drive.
   ``Many members are concerned about letters they are receiving,
complaining about the mayor and the crime rate,'' Fauntroy said.
``But they will not be an insurmountable obstacle.''

   A typhoon swept through eastern Siberia, killing
nine people and destroying about 700 homes, the official news
agency Tass reported Thursday.
   The storm Wednesday ravaged hundreds of thousands of miles in
the Irkutsk region about 2,500 miles east of Moscow, causing an
estimated $160 million worth of damage, Tass said.
   The weather in the region had been extremely hot and dry for
days beforehand, and high winds from the typhoon _ rare for the
area _ destroyed buildings, left hundreds homeless and caused
numerous fires, the news agency said.
   It did not specify where the typhoon originated or how and where
the people died.
   Tass said firefighting teams managed to bring the blazes under
control after several hours.

<TEXT>
   About 70,000 backers of interim
President Ion Iliescu rallied Thursday on the last official day of
the election campaign, but tens of thousands of demonstrators
elsewhere branded him a ``neo-Communist.''
   The pro-Iliescu crowd, some chanting ``We Love You, Iliescu,''
massed in north Bucharest. They heard their candidate pledge to
keep Romania democratic.
   An estimated 30,000 anti-Iliescu demonstrators converged on
University Square in downtown Bucharest. It was the largest crowd
yet in a demonstration that has blocked the square and the
capital's main central thoroughfare 24 hours a day since April 22.
   However, a feared mass confrontation between the two groups did
not materialize.
   Police quickly broke up fistfights among about a dozen people
from the rival groups. One government backer was detained.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front have dominated the
government since the December revolution that deposed Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. They are heavily favored in Sunday's
presidential and parliamentary elections, Romania's first free poll
in 53 years.
   Iliescu and two challengers for the presidency _ the National
Liberal Party's Radu Campeanu and the National Peasants Party's Ion
Ratiu _ held the nation's first-ever televised debate between
presidential candidates Thursday night.
   The two opposition candidates repeated their charges that the
Front was responsible for violence that has plagued their
campaigns. The Peasants Party claims 60 attacks against its
supporters, including two fatal assaults.
   Iliescu said it was ``inconceivable that the Front, which led
the government charged with maintaining a peaceful campaign, would
also disrupt it.''
   Asked about the possibility of a coalition government after the
elections, Iliescu said it was ``not only possible but necessary.''
   Campeanu called it ``a logical idea.''
   The debate failed to generate heated exchanges between the
candidates, who repeated campaign speeches they used in previous
weeks.
   Addressing his supporters earlier Thursday at Aviators' Square
in north Bucharest, Iliescu pledged to ``guarantee the future of
democracy'' in Romania.
   The stage was surrounded by scores of guards who were barely
able to keep the boisterous demonstrators from rushing the stage as
they sang, ``May Ratiu and Campeanu Die of Sorrow.''
   ``In five short months, we have presented a solid record of
achievement,'' declared Premier Petre Roman, flashing the ``V''
sign that has become his trademark.
   The capital's anti-government protestors were joined by groups
of students from western Timisoara and other cities. Timisoara is
where the December revolution began.
   The anti-government demonstrators, who paralyzed traffic in the
capital, vowed to stay put until election day, despite a ban on
political rallies Friday and Saturday.
   Last Saturday, Iliescu said the square should be ``cleaned out''
after Thursday. But Roman said Wednesday the government had decided
to allow the demonstrators to remain to avoid a ``provocation.''
   The demonstrators charge that Iliescu and the Front still harbor
Communist and totalitarian tendencies. Iliescu and some other
members of the Front once held positions in the toppled Communist
regime.
   The opposition backers also accuse the Front of manipulating
state-run media to its political advantage.

   It doesn't think like C-3PO or R2D2, but this
robot can amble along the rocky surfaces of Mars or the moon as
well as any ``Star Wars'' machine did in a galaxy far, far away.
   Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University unveiled the prototype
Thursday. Nicknamed the ``Ambler'' by the team that has been
working on it since October 1987, the aluminum robot stands 12 feet
tall and has paired stacks of three legs that enable it to traverse
uneven terrain.
   ``A walking robot was needed as an alternative to the
traditional line of wheeled rovers,'' said David B. Lavery, manager
of the Planetary Rovers program at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``What we want to do is demonstrate that legged vehicles ...
have an acceptable place,'' he said. ``I think the Ambler has
successfully done that.''
   William L. Whittaker, one of three Carnegie Mellon robotics
experts heading the project, said the robot moves like a
cross-country skier.
   ``A single leg reaches out in front of the others, places itself
firmly on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine
forward,'' he said.
   Robots using Ambler technology are slated for use in a series of
mechanized missions to Mars, Lavery said. He estimated walking
robots could be on the Martian surface by the end of the decade.
   President Bush last week set a deadline of 2019 for Americans to
walk on Mars. The date is 50 years after Neil Armstrong, Michael
Collins and Buzz Aldrin first landed on the moon.
   The Ambler, which recently took its first steps, is one project
being evaluated by the NASA rovers program, Lavery said. The other
projects under consideration are all wheeled rovers, he said.
   ``The intent for the vehicles ... is for them to be capable of
operating on their own with just a very general set of
directions,'' he said.
   That objective has been met in the Ambler, according to Takeo
Kanade, Whittaker's associate.
   ``Our goal is basically to demonstrate that actual exploration
of planets is possible,'' Kanade said.
   The Ambler has the ability to assess its environment, make
decisions, move and interact with or manipulate objects, he said.
   ``The Ambler is one of very few systems that embody all four
capabilities,'' he said.
   Kanade, who serves as co-director of Carnegie Mellon's Robotics
Institute, said the Ambler prototype will never go into space. But
the robot's technology should be ready for space flight within a
decade.
   Meantime, Kanade envisions other uses for the technology.
   ``It's not just the very narrow, kind of strange applications of
space exploration. It has a very broad impact,'' he said.
   Independent walking robots designed to adapt to a variety of
environments could be used for construction projects on the moon
and to clean up hazardous waste on Earth, he said.
   ``These machines will have to contend with rugged and soft
terrain, low temperatures, high winds, dust and equipment
failure,'' Kanade said. ``These are robots that work in
environments that are not traditionally designed for robots.
   ``The impact of this kind of program is phenomenal.''
   Kanade said the university has spent $4.5 million in NASA grants
to develop the Ambler.

   King Birendra on Thursday announced a
general amnesty for political prisoners in the Himalayan kingdom,
most of whom were jailed for violating a ban on political parties.
   A statement from the palace said the king made the decision on
the advice of Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, who took
office last month after a two-month campaign for greater democracy.
   Political prisoners were arrested under the Association and
Organization Control Act, a 1961 law that banned membership to
political parties or any other political affiliation.
   The law was taken off the books last month in this nation of 17
million residents, a week before leaders of the pro-democracy
movement formed the government.
   Chief government spokesman Radhey Shyam Bista said the number of
prisoners detained under the act was ``being worked out.'' He
declined to give a rough estimate.
   The pro-democracy movement broke the monarch's 29-year-old grip
on power in Nepal. Previously, the Cabinet was chosen from a
partyless National Assembly.
   One-fifth of the assembly's 140 members were nominated by the
king and, political observers say, candidates for the other posts
were screened by the palace before being allowed to stand for
elections.
   The leaders of the pro-democracy movement have promised to hold
free elections by next April and say they will reform the present
constitution, which gives the king sweeping legislative, executive
and judicial powers.

   President Abdou Diouf of Senegal said Thursday
people should get rid of the idea that African leaders come to the
United States begging for money.
   ``That is not my case,'' he told reporters.
   He was replying to a questioner who suggested he was leaving
empty-handed after talking with President Bush and leaders of his
administration.
   Diouf asked Bush for more help when he visited the White House
Monday. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater reported Bush
said he was sympathetic but could not promise anything beyond the
$40 million a year Senegal has been getting.
   Diouf said he came to reaffirm links with the United States, the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. And he said he had
ample success and nothing to complain about.
   He said it would be better to have more help, but it was wrong
to think that African presidents came to Washington just to pack
their valises with aid.
   Diouf spoke at length of the monument to be erected at Almadies,
Africa's westernmost point, in memory of slaves put aboard ships in
Senegal for sale in North America in past centuries. He said the
statue was not meant to show anger but as a symbol of a common
desire to end violence and alienation among peoples.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, venturing
into sensitive pre-summit diplomacy, said Thursday he would meet in
Moscow Friday with the prime minister of the rebellious Soviet
republic of Lithuania.
   Baker informed Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of
the decision as they tried to break a deadlock on arms control
issues less than two weeks before the Washington summit.
   ``There are gaps between us still. ... I can't tell you we are
going to get there,'' a senior U.S. official said of Baker's
attempt to forge an agreement on nuclear weapons cuts before
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold their
May 31-June 3 talks.
   Bush said Wednesday that the Soviets' action against Lithuania
``certainly puts some tension'' on summit prospects, but he also
said it would not stand in the way of any arms agreement.
   Gorbachev met Thursday with Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene in his first such meeting with a top Lithuanian official
since the Baltic republic declared independence.
   Even so, the senior U.S. official insisted the Soviets had not
fulfilled the Bush administration's call for them to take part in a
dialogue with the Baltic leaders.
   ``It is not enough simply to talk about a need for dialogue,''
the official said. ``You have to do something that makes it happen.
And they are continuing to stick to a position that accepts
dialogue but only under certain conditions.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene and other leaders of the republic have said they
are willing to negotiate everything except their independence
declaration.
   The senior U.S. official said Baker, who was planning to fly
home at midday Saturday, would stay on for further talks with the
Soviets if there was a chance of an accord on nuclear arms control.
He is due to see Gorbachev Friday.
   ``The work is intense right now,'' said the official, who
briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him anonymity.
   Baker told Shevardnadze that he would see Mrs. Prunskiene and
``his reaction was a non-reaction,'' the official said.
   Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania revoke its March 11
declaration of independence, but on Thursday asked merely for a
suspension, Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters.
   Tensions in the Baltics and the stalemate on arms control issues
were hindering Baker's effort to set a summit agenda with
Shevardnadze.
   But symbolically, at least, they showed a spirit of cooperation.
   Shevardnadze took Baker on a tour of a Russian Orthodox church
complex at Zagorsk, 45 miles northeast of the capital, and to the
nearby village of Radonezh.
   The 24-car motorcade stopped at the modest home of a 76-year-old
Russian woman who engaged Baker and Shevardnadze in a discussion of
her pension, raised recently from 55 to 70 rubles a month _ the
equivalent of about $40. ``It will be increased,'' Shevardnadze
promised.
   Another elderly woman, wearing a purple scarf, told Baker the
village church was closed ``and we have no place to pray.'' Appeals
to authorities had not succeeded, she said.
   Shevardnadze told Baker afterward that the church would be
reopened, a U.S. official said.
   When Baker arrived in Moscow Tuesday from Washington, the
request from Mrs. Prunskiene for a meeting was given to him by U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr.
   ``We are not seeking to send any message by meeting with her,''
the senior U.S. official said. ``It obviously gives us a chance to
hear more about her concerns.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene has met in Washington with Bush. Still, the
meeting with Baker here in Moscow, amid summit preparations, added
a twist to the situation.
   Baker has already informed the Soviets that failure to resolve
the dispute with the Baltics could interfere with an improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations at the summit.
   On the arms control front, meanwhile, Baker said Thursday he had
not made much headway in bending the Soviet Union to U.S. positions
on strategic weapons cuts.
   But Baker said he was still hopeful. He and Shevardnadze met
twice during the day, for 45 minutes in the morning and for nearly
five hours after their sightseeing venture.
   Baker's main goal is to bring the Soviets in line with the
United States on air and sea-launched cruise missiles. That would
break a stalemate and clear the way for a declaration at the
superpower summit in Washington in two weeks.
   Asked if he had made headway, Baker told reporters: ``No, not a
lot.''
   But later, leaving the Trinity Monastery in Zagorsk, a monument
to medieval Russia, Baker was a bit more upbeat. ``We hope we've
made some progress. We'll know more when we get back,'' he said.
   The tour of the center of Russian Orthodoxy was arranged by
Shevardnadze to give Baker some flavor of life outside Moscow.
   The church, even in stricter times, has enjoyed special
privileges in a state that theoretically, at least, is atheistic.
   Baker and Shevardnadze met with church leaders, examined ornate
icons, and weaved their way past mostly elderly women saying their
prayers and lighting candles.
   While they motored back, Gennady Gerasimov, the spokesman for
the Soviet Foreign Ministry, held a briefing in which he
sidestepped questions about possible compromises in the U.S. and
Soviet positions.
   Still, Gerasimov, to illustrate Soviet determination to reach an
agreement, quoted Shevardnadze as jokingly telling his arms control
negotiators: ``If you don't agree, you will be fired.''

   An estimated 150,000 government
employees returned to work Thursday, ending a weeklong strike that
savaged Nicaragua's already crippled economy and hamstrung the new,
U.S.-backed administration.
   The huge walkouts were a victory for the leftist Sandinista
National Liberation Front, which engineered the strikes beginning
Friday to press for job security and big pay increases.
   The 3-week-old government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro promised not to fire those who walked off their jobs and
agreed to double salaries for the public employees as part of the
strike settlement.
   That was about half what the Sandinista-dominated unions
originally asked but higher than the 60 percent Mrs. Chamorro
initially offered.
   She has devalued the cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, four times
since she took office April 25; inflation however is averaging 70
percent monthly, in effect steadily reducing the real wages of
workers in this nation of 3.5 million residents.
   ``Everything is returning to normal. Employees at the banking
system cleared out the offices they had occupied and those at the
ministries are following suit,'' presidential spokesman Danilo
Lacayo said in a telephone interview.
   The international airport reopened and the bus system was
getting back into gear.
   In Washington, President Bush complained that a procedural
deadlock in Congress was holding up a $300 million aid package for
Nicaragua and that he could not disburse $40 million in emergency
help requested by Mrs. Chamorro until the package is approved.
   Alejandro Solorzano, a labor leader who supports Mrs. Chamorro,
said the strike more resembled an attempt by the Sandinistas to
bring down the new government than a job action.
   ``The strike was managed directly by a few leaders of the
Sandinista Front. It was an attempted coup, carried out by
adventurers and holdup men who checkmated the government,''
Solorzano said. ``The government will have to strengthen itself to
prevent another coup attempt by the Sandinistas.''
   Solorzano is secretary-general of the Federation of Independent
Workers, a branch of the Socialist Party that forms part of Mrs.
Chamorro's coalition.
   Barricada, the Sandinista party newspaper, ran an editorial
calling the strike a triumph for the workers and for democracy.
   ``An attempt to overrun legality and flirting with
totalitarianism almost set off a blood bath in the country and the
conflict would have been aggravated if the government had resorted
to repressive force,'' it said.
   The strike in Central America's largest country had been stepped
up daily since May 10. Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga
estimated it cost the government $10 million in lost production and
revenues.
   The government budget had planned for eventual raises similar to
those granted, but because of the strike they had to be granted
sooner than planned, Mayorga said.
   The banker said Nicaragua is counting on the Conference of
Donors for help. The organization of industrialized, mostly
European nations aids Third World nations. It meets in Rome June
6-7.
   The country's cash crisis was deepened by U.S. failure to
provide the emergency aid Mrs. Chamorro asked.
   The Chamorro administration inherited from the Sandinistas a
paltry $3 million in cash at the treasury and a foreign debt of $11
billion.
   Inflation is chronic _ prices for consumer goods and services
have been skyrocketing, changing in some cases daily. Public
employees earn from as little as $10 to $12 a month for a cleaning
woman to $350 a month for the deputy manager of a state-operated
bank.
   U.S. officials said meanwhile the administration was getting
ready to provide a month's worth of food for 14,000 rebels whose
supplies are running out, taking $1 million to $1.5 million from
aid programs to other countries.
   The United States supported the rebels, known as Contras, in
their guerrilla war against the former Sandinista government, which
came to power in 1979.
   Despite a plan to gradually disband the rebels, hostility
remains strong between the Sandinistas and the Contras after 10
years of warfare. Nicaraguan and U.S. officials are worried about
renewed conflict if the rebels leave the safety of security zones
set up for them.
   Mrs. Chamorro overwhelmingly won elections on Feb. 25 for a
six-year term. But her United National Opposition, a 14-party
coalition, is fragmented and ranges from Communists to hard-line
conservatives.
   Former President Daniel Ortega's Sandinistas, with 40 percent of
the vote, remain Nicaragua's largest single party. Ortega said the
Sandinistas will ``continue to govern from below.''
   The Sandinista insist that the Contras disband by June 10 as
they promised. Ortega's people continue their control of the
military and demand that Mrs. Chamorro not touch their
revolutionary reforms.

<HEAD>Hungary Caretaker Gov't Ends Last Cabinet Session With Champagne</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's caretaker government of
Premier Miklos Nemeth held its final Cabinet session Thursday, then
invited reporters in for a farewell glass of champagne.
   Outgoing government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said the Cabinet
reviewed the country's economic peformance for the first three
months of 1990, and concluded that generally positive trends have
been dampened by rising unemployment.
   ``If the trend continues at this rate, we will have 100,000
unemployed by the end of the year,'' Bajnok said.
   Nemeth took over as Hungarian premier 16 months ago, when
Hungary was still ruled by the Communist Party.
   He and his government oversaw a peaceful transition to
multiparty democracy and free elections last March in which Nemeth
and other reform communists united in a new Socialist party fared
poorly, finishing fourth.
   ``The Nemeth team did what it had accepted to do with honor,''
Bajnok said.
   Nemeth, 42, and his team leave the incoming center-right
government of Joszef Antall with 59 draft laws, the task of
transforming Hungary's economy and repaying its large $20 billion
foreign debt.
   The premier, who was elected to the new Parliament, told
reporters he plans to rest over the summer before deciding whether
to continue his career as a politician or pursue his trained
profession of economist.

   Fans who pointed their binoculars in the right
direction during the seventh inning of Tuesday's Toronto Blue
Jays-Seattle Mariners game got an inside look at another event.
   Under the glare of ballpark lights, a naked man and towel-clad
woman framed in the window of their darkened hotel room above the
SkyDome scoreboard were clearly enjoying themselves.
   ``I never suspected in my wildest dreams that someone would be
doing it right in front of the window,'' said Jays president Paul
Beeston.
   We ``would take the position that it is a public place and that
such behavior should not be condoned,'' Beeston said.
   SkyDome spokesman David Garrick said the couple should have been
charged.
   But Police Det. Paul Feeney said that before a charge of public
indecency can be laid there has to be evidence of intent to offend.
   ``In this case, they could argue that there was a reasonable
expectation of privacy,'' said Feeney.
   Six weeks ago, a man who was caught performing an indecent act
in front of a window at the hotel wasn't charged because he thought
it was one-way glass and that he couldn't be seen.
   ``How our guests behave behind closed doors, unless they are
committing a crime, is none of our business,'' said SkyDome Hotel
manager Ray Thompson.
   However, Thompson said he is considering asking guests to sign a
waiver of liability.

   Local billboards are featuring a picture of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on an ad for a Minnesota-made
vodka with the caption ``The Party's Over,'' an allusion to the
loss of power by the Communist Party.
   But the party is just beginning for the Twin Cities, where
Gorbachev plans to visit June 3 following his summit meeting with
President Bush.
   Partner Gerry Schmitt of Minneapolis ad agency Schmitt &amp; Sloan,
which created the billboard ad, is elated over news of Gorbachev's
impending visit.
   ``We think he's coming to see us,'' she said Tuesday. ``The
stories say he's coming to see some undisclosed company. We think
we're the one.''
   Gorbachev may get to see his likeness on the 38 billboards
promoting Karkov vodka.
   Scmitt said the billboards will stay up until mid-June.
   The company hopes Gorbachev sees one of them, said Felix
Phillips, lawyer for U.S. Distilled Products Co., which makes the
vodka in Princeton and markets it in several states.
   ``We'd be very happy if he climbed up and signed one,'' Phillips
said.
   Ad agency partner Jeff Sloan said artists intentionally put the
Soviet president's birthmark on the wrong side of his head in the
ad to make it more noticeable from the viewer's perspective.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with the
Lithuanian prime minister on Thursday in a major breakthrough in
the Baltic secession struggle, but he demanded the breakaway
republic make further concessions.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said they met for
one hour and 40 minutes in the Kremlin, and that Gorbachev told her
``the fact that we are meeting means we have moved from our initial
positions. And this is a big step forward.''
   She told reporters the discussion was ``difficult'' at first,
but improved as it went along, though complete agreement was not
reached.
   Gorbachev had refused to meet with the secessionist leaders of
the three Baltics republics and earlier in the day accused them of
adventurism.
   The Kremlin meeting, set by Gorbachev in a telephone call to
Mrs. Prunskiene shortly after she arrived at Lithuania's mission in
Moscow, broke the deadlock between Moscow and Lithuania over
Lithuania's declaration of independence on March 11.
   Soviet authorities forcibly annexed Lithuania and its sister
republics of Estonia and Latvia in 1940, and all three have
declared moves toward independence this year.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who had said that
the Baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the May 30-June 3
superpower summit in Washington, told reporters he would meet with
Mrs. Prunskiene on Friday. President Bush received her at the White
House earlier this month.
   Gorbachev first demanded that Lithuania rescind its declaration,
but on Thursday merely called for a suspension.
   The Lithuanian parliament has balked at revoking the declaration
but on Wednesday voted to suspend post-independence laws if the
Kremlin will open talks on independence.
   A compromise appeared to be emerging along the lines of a
formula proposed last month by President Francois Mitterrand of
France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
   In addition to suspending certain laws, Lithuanian concessions
add a transition period before full independence and make concrete
proposals on military cooperation, economic plans and other topics.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
would call the Supreme Council parliament into session on Saturday
to formalize the offer. She said if Moscow finds parliament's
action acceptable, the two sides could select negotiating teams.
   ``This does not mean we are returning to the situation of March
10,'' she told reporters, underlining Lithuania's determination to
strive for independence.
   At the meeting, Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
told Mrs. Prunskiene the Lithuanian concessions did not meet their
demand to suspend the Lithuanian declaration of independence, the
official Tass news agency reported.
   ``K. Prunskiene's attention was drawn to the indispensable
necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet cancel _ or at a
minimum, suspend _ this act and all the legislative measures
following it that contradict the Soviet constitution,'' Tass
reported.
   The leaders told Mrs. Prunskiene that concession was the only
way to launch negotiations, the report said.
   But Tass said the leaders noted that the Lithuanian offer showed
``certain steps had been made toward the normalization of the
situation.''
   ``Prunskiene called the meeting `an introduction to coming
negotiations,''' said Longinas Vasiliauskas, press attache of the
Lithuanian representation in Moscow.
   Earlier Thursday, Gorbachev lashed out at what he called the
``adventurism'' of Baltic independence leaders.
   ``A constructive approach is needed. We will not permit any
violation of the constitution or any division from the
constitutional process,'' Gorbachev told Britain's Channel 4
television at a Moscow parliamentary meeting.
   ``I believe that the Lithuanian leadership and some others
cannot get rid of adventurism,'' he said in a separate session with
foreign journalists.
   Mrs. Prunskiene came to the Soviet capital Thursday evening. She
said her republic of 3.8 million people was willing to make another
major concession, agreeing to remain part of the Soviet security
system.
   Concessions approved by the Lithuanian parliament Wednesday
would ``stop unilateral action for realizing the declaration of ..
. independence for the Lithunian government, especially in those
spheres most important to the Soviet Union, most of all, defense
and borders,'' she told reporters.
   But she said Lithuania would stand fast on the declaration
itself. ``The declaration of independence is active and is not a
subject for discussion or negotiations,'' she said.
   Gorbachev has rejected Lithuania's declaration of independence
and attempts at more gradual secession by Estonia and Latvia. He
imposed an oil and natural gas embargo and other ecomomic sanctions
on Lithuania, causing some businesses there to close and thousands
of workers to be laid off.
   Soviet military officials are concerned by the refusal of
Lithuanian youths to serve in the Soviet Armed Forces, and by
prospects they would lose access to the Baltic ports of Klaipeda
and Kaliningrad, accessible by land only across Lithuanian
territory.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said the military compromise would involve
``participation of Lithuania in the defense system of the Soviet
Union.'' She gave no details.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said negotiators must resolve hundreds of issues
before a final deal is cut with Moscow.
   Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ilmars Bisers said Wednesday that
talks on Baltic independence would start next week with midlevel
Kremlin officials. He said talks with Soviet officials would focus
on ``the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty with the
Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>Chinese Leader Says Tianamen Uproar `Much Ado About Nothing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of China's Communist Party says the
West's anger over last year's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in his country was ``much ado about nothing.''
   Jiang Zemin also told ABC-TV's ``20-20'' program that he had no
regrets about the way the June demonstrations in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square were handled. Troops opened fire, killing hundreds
of protesters.
   But, he told Barbara Walters, Chinese leaders ``learn by our
mistakes'' so similar demonstrations may be handled with non-lethal
force.
   ``We have made adequate preparations in terms of strengthening
the police force and storing of non-lethal weapons,'' he said. ``In
this regard, I'm ready to learn from all the developed Western
countries.''
   The interview, to be aired Friday night, is apparently the first
Jiang has granted a foreign television reporter since he was named
general secretary of the Communist Party in June after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown. Jiang also hold his government's top
two military posts.
   He replaced Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed for supporting the
pro-democracy movement, and was the handpicked successor of the
country's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping, who resigned last year from
all his official posts at the age of 84.
   Jiang agreed to the interview as the Bush administration neared
a deadline on deciding whether to extend trade concessions to China.
   President Bush, who suspended military cooperation with China to
protest Tiananmen, has until June 3 to decide whether to extend
China's most-favored-nation status by one year. The status, granted
to most U.S. trading partners, reduces tariffs significantly on
imports.
   Bush told reporters Wednesday that while he didn't want to send
a signal to Beijing that he approves of the government's human
rights record, removing most-favored-nation status would adversely
affect Hong Kong, the British colony that funnels 70 percent of
China's exports to the United States.
   Jiang warned that revoking China's trade concessions would
``work against the interests of our two countries'' and those of
the entire southeast Asian region.
   ``I hope that the U.S. government would consider this matter
from a long-term perspective,'' he said.
   Jiang said that after last year's demonstrations, there was
``some kind of misunderstanding, lack of understanding, or even
not-so-friendly attitudes'' toward China.
   ``Therefore, to give you a Chinese proverb, I would say it's
like `much ado about nothing,''' he said.
   In a rare glimpse of the internal workings of China's secretive
leadership, Jiang said ``there were different opinions within the
top Chinese leadership, and that was the crucial point'' in the
decision to resort to lethal force to quell the protest.
   Jiang said that if at the start of the student unrest in April
1989, ``we adopted resolute measures, for example by declaring a
ban on assembly in Tiananmen Square, then it would have been easier
for us to deal with the problem at a later stage.''
   As mayor of Shanghai at the time, Jiang said, he had dealt with
protesters there by persuasion rather than force.
   Jiang said no protesters were executed as a direct result of the
Tiananmen events. China's official press reported 20 executions.
   He said 431 people, including 42 students, were still in
detention. According to unofficial estimates, 10,000 to 15,000
people were detained after the protests. China announced last week
that it had released 211 prisoners, including several prominent
academics.
   Jiang said that despite the fall of communism in Eastern Europe,
China would not tolerate any opposition to socialism and would
combat ``bourgeois liberalization.'' But, he added, China is not
opposed to everything about capitalism.
   ``We want to learn from the know-how and even buy know-how from
Western countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>Most State Charges Against Leona Helmsley Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tax fraud indictment against Leona Helmsley
was gutted Thursday by a judge who said state prosecutors were
putting the self-styled hotel queen in double jeopardy.
   State Supreme Court Justice John Bradley said he dropped 180 of
the 188 counts in the indictment because they are similar to those
on which Mrs. Helmsley was tried in federal court last August.
   ``The court threw out the heart and soul of the state's case,''
said Alan Dershowitz, lead lawyer of Mrs. Helmsley's legal team.
``New evidence will demonstrate that Mrs. Helmsley did not evade
taxes.''
   ``I'm very happy,'' Mrs. Helmsley, 70, said tearfully as she
left court after hearing Bradley's ruling. She suggested that the
case against her was brought only because of her prominence.
   ``They're after my hide,'' she said. ``I'm Leona Helmsley.''
   ``I hold my head high because I know that I am an innocent
person falsely accused and terribly maligned,'' she said.
   The federal case related solely to Dunellen Hall, the Helmsley's
mansion in Greenwich, Conn. The Helmsleys were charged with
furnishing, renovating and operating the estate by charging its
expenses to their businesses.
   Mrs. Helmsley was sentenced to four years in prison and fined
$7.1 million in the federal case. She is appealing the conviction
and sentence, maintaining that she in fact overpaid her taxes.
   Her husband, real estate billionaire Harry Helmsley, 80, was
found incompetent to stand trial in the federal case. He is trying
to avoid a state trial on on similar grounds.
   He has been examined by a psychiatrist, according to Leslie
Gersing of the state attorney general's office, and a hearing on
the exam results is scheduled for May 23 before Bradley.
   The dropped charges are counts of conspiracy, offering a false
instrument for filing, falsifying business records, and scheme to
defraud, all of which relate to Dunellen Hall and were dealt with
in the federal case.
   The state charges involved Dunellen Hall as well as a
condominium in North Hills, N.Y., and the Park Lane Hotel, the
Helmsleys' New York City home.
   The judge let stand the eight counts that did not involve the
Connecticut estate. He noted that the alleged state tax fraud
conspiracy preceded and outlasted the federal conspiracy.
   Bradley refused a defense request to dismiss the remaining eight
charges ``in the interest of justice.'' He said the impact of such
an act on public confidence would be ``devastating.''
   The charges that remain are counts of offering a false
instrument for filing, a felony. Each count is punishable by up to
four years in prison.
   Gersing, the state attorney general's spokeswoman, said one of
the eight charges relate to Mrs. Helmsley's personal taxes and the
others involve Helmsley businesses. She observed that Bradley
dismissed the charges on principles of law, not on the merits of
the allegations.
   Gersing said prosecutors were studying the Bradley decision and
had not decided whether to appeal.

   An Israeli defense official said Thursday that
Israel is seeking proof a Lebanese Shiite militia is holding the
bodies of two Israeli soldiers before considering swapping Moslem
prisoners for the remains.
   Such an exchange with the mainstream Amal militia could
encourage more releases of Western hostages held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian radicals. There are now 16 Western hostages, including
six Americans.
   The Israeli official, who conveyed an official position though
he spoke on condition of anonymity, was reacting to an Amal
proposal reported by the Beirut daily Al Anwar on May 12.
   According to the report, Amal was ready to hand over the bodies
of two Israeli servicemen killed in south Lebanon in exchange for
the release of Shiite prisoners.
   After two U.S. hostages were freed last month, Iran and allied
groups in Lebanon demanded a goodwill gesture, such as the release
of prisoners held by the Israel-backed South Lebanon Army.
   The mostly Christian, 2,500-member militia holds more than 300
prisoners at al-Khiam prison in south Lebanon.
   Last week, South Lebanon Army commander Gen. Antoine Lahad
rebuffed appeals to make prisoner releases solely to help Western
hostages. He said three captured Israeli soldiers and missing
militiamen from his army must be part of any deal.
   The Israeli official said Israel had no information about Amal
holding any bodies of Israeli soldiers. Most of the seven Israeli
servicemen missing in Lebanon are believed to be in the hands of
radical Iranian-backed or Palestinian groups.
   ``If Amal believes the bodies are those of Israeli soldiers, let
it first submit evidence to this effect. Only after we are
convinced the bodies are in fact those of Israeli soldiers will
there be room to negotiate the matter.''
   Longest held of the 16 Western hostages is American Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Marlon Brando's eldest son told police he
shot and killed his pregnant sister's boyfriend in a fit of rage
because the man had beaten her, investigators said Thursday.
   Christian Brando, 32, was arrested in the actor's palatial Santa
Monica Mountains estate Wednesday night and booked for
investigation of murder, said Lt. Ron Hall. He was held without
bail pending arraignment Friday.
   ``He admitted to the shooting,'' the lieutenant said.
   Dag Drollet, 26, died instantly from a .45-caliber bullet to the
head, police said. An autopsy was planned for Friday, said
coroner's office spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   Marlon Brando, 66, made a 911 emergency call to police at about
10:45 p.m. to report a shooting inside his estate, police said.
Only one shot was fired.
   ``The dispute was over the victim's treatment of Cheyenne
Brando, Marlon Brando's 20-year-old daughter,'' Hall said. ``There
were allegations that there was physical abuse, a beating. There
was an argument and he became angry.''
   Tarita Cheyenne is the daughter of Brando and his current wife,
Tarita Teriipia, a Tahitian actress who played his love in the 1962
remake of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
   A Brando lawyer said the daughter was ``pretty well along'' in
her pregnancy but declined to be more specific or identify the
father.
   After police and paramedics arrived at the gated estate
overlooking Beverly Hills, Drollet's body was found in what was
described as an entertainment room. Hall said Christian Brando was
alone with Drollet when the shooting occurred. The investigator
said the Oscar-winning actor, his wife and daughter were in another
wing of the home and didn't see the shooting.
   Brando's two other sons, Miko and Simon, weren't at the estate
at the time.
   Officers recovered the gun used in the killing and several other
weapons were confiscated, including a M14 carbine, a shotgun and an
Uzi. Police and Brando lawyers wouldn't say who owned the guns.
   ``I don't want these guns here. Take these guns out of here,''
Marlon Brando was quoted as telling police.
   Drollet was a family friend from Tahiti who had been a house
guest for 10 days, police said. Little was known about the man.
   ``There was no indication there had been a physical altrcation
prior to the shooting,'' said Detective Steve Osti.
   Christian Brando was calm when police arrived.
   After a 45-minute jailhouse meeting with Christian, attorney Dan
Stormer said the younger Brando was distraught.
   ``He's as upset as you'd expect him to be for someone in his
position,'' said Stormer, who is working with the actor's attorney,
William Kunstler.
   ``It's truly a tragic incident that's going to cause a lot of
personal pain for him and his family.''
   Christian Brando will plead innocent, Kunstler, an associate of
the actor in civil rights struggles over the past 30 years, said
from New York.
   Asked about the alleged confession, Kunstler partner Ronald Kuby
said: ``We are engaged in an investigation and we aren't making any
statements on the substance of the case.''
   Christian Brando is the son of the actor and his first wife,
Anna Kashfi. The couple divorced in 1960. There was little known
about his adult years, other than he was once employed as a tree
surgeon and most recently as a welder.
   Marlon Brando won best actor Oscars in 1954 for ``On the
Waterfront'' and in 1972 for ``The Godfather.''

   NASA said Thursday it is working
toward a May 30 launch date for space shuttle Columbia, whose
astronomy mission was delayed by work to replace a bad cooling
valve.
   The so-called ``assessment dates'' are usually accurate, barring
unforeseen problems, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   ``It gives the workers a date and target they're operating
toward. It gives them a schedule deadline so they know what work
needs to be done,'' he said.
   Mission managers are expected to set an official launch date at
a flight readiness review teleconference on May 24.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off this week with seven
astronauts and the $100 million Astro observatory, capable of
probing sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. But the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration postponed the 36th
shuttle mission two to three weeks in order to replace the valve at
the launch pad.
   Technicians on Thursday finished soldering lines connected to a
new valve. The bad valve, which was removed Tuesday, had a torn
filter.
   The valve, which has a replacement value of $141,000, will be
recertified and installed on the shuttle Endeavour, which is under
construction in California and due to fly in early 1992, Buckingham
said.
   Columbia's cooling system will be tested, then purged to remove
excess moisture. It will be filled again with a refrigerant,
probably on Monday.

<TEXT>
   The Oregonian has dropped Jimmy Breslin's
syndicated column because of racial slurs he made about a
co-worker, the newspaper announced Thursday.
   Breslin recently lambasted a Korean-American reporter with New
York Newsday after she criticized one of his columns as sexist.
   In a newsroom tirade, Breslin called Ji-Yeon Yuh a ``yellow
cur'' and ``slant-eyed.'' The reporter wasn't present during the
obscenity-laced outburst. On May 8, Newsday suspended Breslin for
two weeks.
   ``Breslin revealed attitudes that have no place in the newsroom
or in a nation of people from all walks of life, of all colors,
religions and ethnic and national backgrounds,'' said William A.
Hilliard, editor of The Oregonian. ``And Breslin has no place in
The Oregonian.''
   Reached by telephone in New York, Breslin had little comment
about The Oregonian's action. ``That's up to them. They run the
paper,'' he said.
   Breslin will continue at Newsday.
   ``Jimmy Breslin has been writing about minorities with
compassion, sensitivity and skill for more than a quarter of a
century and we're looking forward to having him back at Newsday,''
the paper's editor Anthony Marro said Thursday.
   Marro said that since the suspension, Newsday has received about
100 telephone calls on the issue, the majority in favor of Breslin.
The newspaper also has received about 80 letters that were about
evenly split on the issue.
   Public reaction to the controversy hasn't influenced the
newspaper's response, Marro said.
   ``I don't edit this paper by poll or by plebiscite,'' he said.
   Breslin's column is syndicated through the Los Angeles Times
Syndicate.
   Doug Mayberry, vice president of sales for the syndicate,
refused to say how many newspapers subscribed to the column and how
many have dropped it since the controversy.
   Marro said he hasn't heard of any other cancellations.
   ``I suspect if anybody else had dropped the column, I would have
heard about it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Maury Povich, who since 1986 has anchored the
syndicated ``A Current Affair,'' said Thursday he's leaving the
weeknight TV series in June next year to co-produce and star in his
own one-hour talk show.
   The as-yet untitled show, to premiere in the fall of 1991, will
appear five nights a week from New York and be co-produced and
syndicated by Paramount Domestic Television, said Povich.
   He said his ``Current Affair'' contract with Fox Broadcasting,
which distributes that show, expires on June 1 next year.
   The craggy-faced anchorman, whose show was criticized as tabloid
television during the program's early days, said he'll continue
doing the show until his contract expires. He said ``A Current
Affair'' is seen in 190 cities.
   In an interview, Povich said he hadn't been restless. ``It's
just that over the last week or so, I began to think that it'll
soon be five years here. That's 1,300 shows. I was here when it was
a baby.
   ``It has grown into an institution and will be a hit long after
I'm gone. And so I thought maybe it's time for the kid to leave the
house _ even though the kid is 51.''
   Povich is married to CBS anchorman Connie Chung.

<HEAD>East German Premier Cautious on All-German Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Germany-Unification, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere sought to rein in West Germany's push for quick
unification by cautioning Thursday against holding all-German
elections too soon.
   ``First we have to clear up the external and internal conditions
for German unity,'' De Maiziere said.
   External issues deal notably with the strategic role of a united
Germany.
   This is being discussed between the two Germanys and the
victorious World War II allies France, Britain, the Soviet Union
and the United States _ and must first be ``satisfactorily sorted
out,'' De Maiziere told reporters.
   He spoke at the end of a two-day visit to Strasbourg during
which he addressed members of the European Parliament and met with
senior European Community officials.
   De Maiziere said also to be settled before all-German elections
is the status of East Germany's treaties and relations with its
partners in the 10-nation, Moscow-led Comecon trade bloc.
   ``East Germany's path into the European Community should not be
a barrier to relations with Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has sought to accelerate
German unification following his party's regional election losses
last Sunday. Union of the two Germanys' currency into a powerful
deutschmark is set for July 2.
   Kohl said Wednesday he wants the ``two-plus-four'' talks
completed by fall and he and his coalition partners want West
Germany's Dec. 2 elections to become all-German.
   Analysts say Kohl figures his Christian Democrats could lose to
the opposition Social Democrats if voting was held only in West
Germany, but might do better in all-German elections.
   De Maiziere, also a Christian Democrat, said he wants to wait
with all-German elections until all questions about unification
have been settled.
   In another development, King Michael, Romania's former monarch,
told members of the European Parliament on Thursday that Sunday's
elections in Romania must be postponed because the election
campaign has been unfair.
   After debating the Romanian voting campaign, the parliament
adopted a resolution telling Romania's ruling National Salvation
Front to end ``their campaign of intimidation.''
   Romanians vote for a two-chamber parliament in their first free
elections in 50 years. Political experts predict the Front will win
60 percent of the vote.
   The Front has led Romania since the December ouster and
execution of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It is said to
shelter former members of Ceausescu's secret police. The election
campaign has been marred by violence and charges that the Front has
been intimidating opponents.
   Michael, who abdicated and left Romania in 1947, said Thursday:
   ``There can be no real democracy in a country where the
government accuses the opposition of `destabilizing' the state,
where peaceful demonstrators are called `a bunch of hooligans' .. .
where the opposition cannot take public opinion polls, where
candidates are regularly beaten, intimidated, persecuted and where
television is a propaganda instrument used by the authorities.''
   The former monarch, who lives in Switzerland, enjoys
considerable popularity in Romania.
   In another resolution Thursday, the European Parliament
unanimously asked the Soviet Union to reopen the case of Swedish
diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved hundreds of Jews in Hungary
during World War II. Wallenberg was arrested by Soviet troops in
1945 and vanished.
   The Soviets have claimed Wallenberg died in 1947, but witnesses
said they saw him alive after this date.

   President Bush said Thursday he won't tolerate
bias in hiring but also won't accept a civil rights bill that
imposes quotas on employers.
   Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and John Danforth, R-Mo.,
quickly unveiled a compromise amendment intended to deal with his
objections to the bill that is at the top of many civil rights
organizations' legislative lists for this year.
   But the White House and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, both said it
failed to remove their concerns about quotas.
   ``I want to sign a civil rights bill, but I will not sign a
quota bill,'' Bush declared at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring the
recently revived U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
   The president, who met three times earlier this week with civil
rights groups and other lobbyists to search for a compromise on the
legislation, said before Kennedy and Danforth announced their new
proposal, ``I think we can work it out.''
   After unveiling the amended version, Danforth said, ``After
weeks of negotiating over this change, we are now convinced that
quotas will not be the unintended result of this bill.'' Danforth
signed with five other senators as the newest sponsors of the bill,
which now has 47 sponsors in the 100-member Senate.
   But Hatch said later, ``The Kennedy-Danforth amendment in no way
solves the severe quota problem in the bill.'' Hatch, the top
Republican on Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee, said
Bush and his advisers were ``too smart to be taken in by this new
language.''
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said,
``It's a step in the right direction but it still does not
eliminate our concern that employers would adopt quotas.''
   There is no mention of quotas _ the hiring of a certain number
or percentage of minority or other workers _ in the bill. But
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and other critics have said the
earlier version's standard of proof for justifying exclusionary
hiring practices was so tough that employers would use quotas as a
way of avoiding lawsuits.
   The legislation would undo a series of 1989 Supreme Court
decisions that made it harder for workers to prove they were
victims of job discrimination.
   ``We will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we
work to advance America's civil rights agenda,'' Bush said to
applause from the audience that included many civil rights leaders.
   ``We can and will make America open and equal to all,'' Bush
said. ``We will tolerate no barriers, no bias, no inside tracks, no
two-tiered system and no rungless ladders.''
   Last month Thornburgh said he might recommend a veto of the
pending bill, which is at the top of many civil rights
organizations' legislative lists for this year.
   But after Bush's comments Thursday, Benjamin Hooks Jr.,
executive director of the NAACP, called it ``a very happy day.''
   Hooks said Bush had moved ``right into the mainstream'' on the
civil rights legislation, although ``a little conflict'' still
remains.
   Bush said that the law must ``obliterate'' consideration of
race, color, religion, sex or national origin from hiring, must
protect ``against harassment in the workplace based on race, sex,
religion or disability and should ensure a speedy end to such
discriminatory practices.''
   ``Our civil rights laws, however, should not be turned into some
lawyer's bonanza, encouraging litigation at the expense of
conciliation, mediation or settlement,'' the president said.
   The legislation would undo a Supreme Court decision that
narrowed the ability of minorities to win monetary damages for job
discrimination, and would restore the burden of proof to defendants
in cases where hiring practices allegedly had a discriminatory
impact.
   For 18 years, employers had the burden of proving a business
necessity for any exclusionary hiring practices. The Supreme Court
altered that in the 1989 Wards Cove case, involving hiring at an
Alaskan salmon cannery.
   The original Senate bill said employers would have to prove
discrimination was essential to job performance. The new version
would require only proof that such practices had a ``substantial
and demonstrable relationship to effective job performance.''
   A similar change was made in the House version recently.
   Bush also named Charles Pei Wang, a New Yorker who is president
of the China Institute in America, to the Civil Rights Commission.

<HEAD>Mrs. Gallo Pleads `No Contest' To Manslaughter Charge, Gets
Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GILROY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A remorseful Aileen Gallo, 77-year-old
wife of multimillionaire winemaker Julio Gallo, pleaded no contest
Thursday to a manslaughter charge in a fatal auto accident and drew
probation and a fine.
   Mrs. Gallo, appearing in court with her husband and weeping as
she faced Gilroy Municipal Court Judge Jerome Brock, was sentenced
to three years' probation, 350 hours of community work, fined
$2,400 and ordered to make restitution to the victim's family on
all uninsured losses.
   Julio Gallo and his brother, Ernest, own the world's largest
winery, headquartered in Modesto. Each brother is estimated to be
worth $500 million. Gilroy is 70 miles south of San Franciso and 50
miles southwest of Modesto.
   Julio's arm was around his wife's shoulders as they faced the
judge. Court clerk Lupe Dellanini said both wept.
   ``It was an emotional hearing,'' the judge told a reporter
later. ``All the indications I have gotten throughout the case from
the probation report and her statement to probation officers and in
court (is) that the woman is pretty much devastated.''
   The judge said he thought Mrs. Gallo would be haunted by the
death of Sharon Kauk, 26. Mrs. Gallo's plea of nolo contendere was
tantamount to a plea of guilty to the charge of misdemeanor
manslaughter in the Jan. 2 accident.
   The maximum penalty was one year in prison.
   The judge said the victim's family asked that Mrs. Gallo not
receive any jail time.
   ``I don't think we could come up with a more sympathetic
defendant, as far as this type of thing goes,'' the judge said.
``She didn't have so much as a parking ticket and lives to do
things for other people.''

   House-Senate negotiators smoothed the way for
passage of a $720 million Central American aid bill Thursday by
dropping controversial measures on abortions and the death penalty
in the District of Columbia.
   President Bush threatened to veto the supplemental
appropriations bill if it included the Democratic proposal to allow
the District to use locally raised tax money for abortions for
impoverished women.
   Negotiators also jettisoned a companion measure, pushed by
Republicans, that would have permitted the death penalty in
nation's capital.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said proponents of the abortion
financing measure abandoned it because they didn't want to threaten
the total money bill. But he vowed to bring the measure up again in
the Senate.
   ``We will be back to pass pro-choice legislation,'' he said.
``We've got the votes.''
   Negotiators cleared the abortion hurdle and made progress in
other areas, but they didn't finish work on the 1990 supplemental
appropriations bill. The money bill, loaded with pork-barrel items
and extraneous provisions, totals about $3.3 billion. Still to be
worked out are differences on defense spending.
   Key provisions in the measure are the $300 million in aid for
Nicaragua and $420 million for Panama. Bush chided Congress this
week for dallying on the Central American aid measure.
   Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro urgently needs the money
because her country is bankrupt and is rocked with by
anti-government strikes, Bush said.
   About 14,000 Nicaraguan Contras are staying in camps under a
U.N. supervised peace agreement reached with Mrs. Chamorro after
she defeated Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   The Bush administration, worried the rebels might run out of
food, is expected to take between $1 million and $1.5 million from
aid programs to other countries to help feed the Contras, said U.S.
officials who asked not to be identified.
   Even former House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas joined the chorus
calling for quick approval of money for Central America.
   ``In my considered view, it is extremely important for Congress
to move as swiftly as possible to approve President Bush's
emergency request for $720 million in desperately needed economic
aid to Panama and Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Once negotiators have reached final agreement, the package must
be approved by the full House and Senate. Money won't be spent to
Central America until an authorization bill is passed by the House.
Debate is set for Monday.
   The 1990 bill contains a host of big-ticket items, including
$110 million for the census; about $162 million for the Head Start
program for poor children; $400 million in housing loans for Israel
to build houses for Soviet emigres; a total of $45 million for Peru
and Bolivia; $705 million for the Agriculture Department's food
stamp program; $10 million for natural disasters; $5 million for
children in Cambodia, and roughly $60 million for flood control.
   Lawmakers removed a proposed $10 million for a U.S. Embassy in
Lithuania.
   There was friction between the House and some senators over the
amount of free mail House members have sent this year.
   The House postage account will be about $44 million in the red
by the end of the year, lawmakers said.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., asked _ and senators conditionally
agreed _ to let the House use $25 million in unspent funds from an
operations fund to help make up the postage deficit.
   ``It now appears the House is going to spend twice as much
money'' on mail as planned, said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
   Controversy has been brewing on the House mailings for some
time, and Fazio told senators the House intends to take up proposed
reforms.
   The House Administration Committee said one reason for the
larger-than-expected deficit will be increased first-class mailings
close to Election Day.
   Many members will turn to first class, at 25 cents per piece,
because they will have used up the three third-class bulk mailings,
at 10 cents each, allowed under the law, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The liberal, autonomy-minded
republics of Croatia and Slovenia on Thursday rejected a threat
from the federal presidency of ``urgent measures'' to save
Communist rule and restore Yugoslavia's disintegrating unity.
   Slovenia said it would use all legal means to preserve its
sovereignty.
   On Wednesday, Slovenia installed the country's first
non-Communist regional government in nearly 50 years. Northern
neighbor Croatia also held multiparty elections and is expected to
install a center-right government at the end of May. Both governing
parties want more regional autonomy.
   Thursday's rejection seemed certain to aggravate their deep
split with the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, Serbia, the
only Yugoslav republic that has not scheduled multiparty elections.
   Yugoslavia's eight-member collective presidency, headed by
Borisav Jovic, a Serb, said Wednesday ``the political and security
situation ... is so unstable that Yugoslavia is currently going
through its most critical phase.''
   Jovic announced introduction of unspecified ``urgent measures''
to protect national integrity.
   Political, ethnic and economic differences have fueled a long
row among the regions and within the disintegrating Communist party.
   The battle for power in the vacuum left by the 1980 death of
Communist Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Tito, now seems headed for a
climax.
   Jovic's remarks set off widespread speculation that martial law
may be introduced in Slovenia and Croatia.
   The orthodox Communist leadership of Serbia opposes changes in
the country's socialist system. It also wants a federal system with
strong central authority in the Serbian and federal capital,
Belgrade.
   Croatia and Slovenia say this constitutes an attempt by Serbian
leader Slobodan Milosevic to retain single-party rule and ensure
Serbian domination.
   Slovenia's collective presidency denounced Jovic on Thursday,
saying he had spoken without consulting the republic.
   ``Democratic, free elections were carried out in Slovenia in
which its citizens, expressing their will, elected a legitimate
leadership,'' the Slovenian presidency said.
   It said the Slovenian developments had enhanced peace and
stability, and called for an urgent conference of Yugoslav
republics to chart a new relationship.
   In a statement carried by Tanjug news agency, Croatia's
collective presidency said the ``realization of democratic
strivings and the expressed will of the citizens of Croatia must
and may not in any way be questioned.''
   It termed Jovic's statements ``arbitrary and unacceptable'' and
demanded more details.
   Yugoslavia's Communist Party and the presidency continue to
formally run the country on the federal level. But the party has
been effectively paralyzed since last January, when Slovenian and
Croatian Communists broke with hard-liners.

   Raisa Gorbachev will join Barbara Bush in a
summit-time trip to Wellesley College where both first ladies will
address the graduating class, it was announced Thursday.
   Mrs. Bush is ``absolutely delighted'' that Mrs. Gorbachev has
accepted her invitation, Anna Perez, the first lady's press
secretary, said at the White House.
   The two first ladies will travel together to the women's college
in Massachusetts on Friday June 1, the second day of their
husbands' four-day summit.
   Mrs. Bush has also invited Mrs. Gorbachev to visit colonial
Williamsburg, Va., while their husbands are occupied, but there is
no word yet on whether the Soviet leader's spouse wants to go
there, Ms. Perez said.
   Some 150 students at Wellesley signed a petition last month
questioning the choice of Mrs. Bush as a commencement speaker,
saying her prominence was based on whom she married.
   The petition signed by a quarter of the senior class said: ``To
honor Barbara Bush as a commencement speaker is to honor a woman
who has gained recognition through the achievements of her husband,
which contradicts what we have been taught over our years at
Wellesley.''
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College after her freshman year
in 1944 to marry Bush, then a Navy pilot. The couple was wed in
January 1945, a few months after Bush survived the downing of his
plane in the Pacific.
   Mrs. Bush, who turns 65 on June 8, has been a career homemaker
and mother of six who moved dozens of time with her husband during
his far-flung career through the oil business, politics and
diplomacy. She has gained recognition in recent years for promoting
literacy and other causes, including the care of babies with AIDS.
   Some feminists and others expressed outrage at the student's
petition slighting Mrs. Bush's qualifications.
   But Ms. Perez said, ``She doesn't think it's a controversy, in
her mind. She absolutely understands ... where the young women are
coming from and she hopes they understand where she is coming
from.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev, 58, is a former university lecturer with a Ph.D.
in philosophy from Moscow State University. She met the future
Soviet leader in a ballroom dancing class while he was in law
school and she was a graduate student in philosophy from Siberia.
   Asked if the Wellesley students might regard Mrs. Gorbachev as
just a mother, Ms. Perez replied, ``Ph.D. in philosophy, party
member _ I don't think so.''
   The Gorbachevs arrive in Washington May 30. The two leaders will
meet over the next four days at the White House and Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   Ms. Perez said that on April 6, the day after the summit dates
were announced, Mrs. Bush contacted Wellesley's president, Nannerl
O. Keohane, and asked if they would like Mrs. Gorbachev to come as
well.
   ``They responded they would be delighted. Very soon after that
... Mrs. Bush extended the invitation in writing to Mrs.
Gorbachev,'' she said.
   Both women agreed to wait to fix their schedules until their
husbands' were set, which was done Thursday.
   Mrs. Bush is not getting an honorary degree at Wellesley. Not
all colleges bestow honorary degrees on commencement speakers.

   A coalition of 26 AIDS and health groups
Thursday asked the National Institutes of Health to make major
changes in its AIDS research priorities to expand clinical testing
and improve coordination.
   The coalition sent to NIH an outline of the changes that could
``cut years off the time when we are finally able to manage'' AIDS,
said Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council.
   The groups said NIH should:
   _Increase financial support of nongovernmental biomedical
research proposals that have been approved by peer-review
committees in the scientific community.
   _Join with the White House and the secretary of the Department
of Health and Human Services to ``spearhead an effort to coordinate
and facilitate AIDS research activities.'' Without such
coordination and sharing of data, ``we never know which crucial
areas of work are being overlooked.''
   _Adopt the coalition's 13-point research program, which includes
expanding clinical trials to include more women, children,
intravenous drug users and blacks, all of whom are now
underrepresented in AIDS studies.
   Other points in the research program include more testing of
drugs to treat the opportunistic infections and diseases that kill
people with AIDS, creation of a national AIDS database and
relaxation of criteria for patients to enter clinical trials.
   Officials at NIH and the National Institute of Allergies and
Infectious Diseases, which is the lead institute on AIDS research,
said they had not seen the coalition's document and could not
comment on it.

   A scientific vessel leased by the
U.S. National Geographic Foundation ran aground on a tiny island
Thursday at the southern tip of South America, the Argentine Coast
Guard said.
   It said there were no injuries among the 32 people aboard the
Norwegian-flagged vessel, the polar ship Duke.
   The vessel, commanded by Carl Sanders, suffered damage to its
bow, the Coast Guard said. It was towed to port at Ushuaia,
Argentina's southermost city on the island of Tierra del Fuego.
   The Argentine news agency Diarios y Noticias quoted Coast Guard
officer Alberto Irurita as saying a small amount of fuel spilled
into the Beagle Channel, but it was surrounded by a floating
barricade and cleaned up by shipboard pumps without damaging
wildlife.
   The Coast Guard said the ship, which was carrying out studies in
the channel, was headed west toward the Chilean port of Punta
Arenas early Thursday when it hit the islet about 17 miles south of
Ushuaia.
   The Beagle Channel is a 125-mile stretch of water that separates
Tierra del Fuego from the more southerly Chilean islands of
Navarino and Hoste.
   There was no word on how the scientific ship ran aground on the
island.
   The vessel also performed support duties for the U.S. Palmer
Base in Antarctica.

   Salvadoran government officials and
guerrilla representatives negotiated over a proposed cease-fire
Thursday during their second day of peace talks in Caracas,
Venezuelan sources said.
   The talks came after the two sides agreed April 4 in Geneva to
renew efforts to bring an end to their decade-long war. More than
70,000 people have been killed.
   U.N. envoy Alvaro de Soto was mediating the Caracas talks. The
discussions, held in a school in a suburb of the capital, were kept
secret behind a cordon of Venezuelan security forces.
   However, Venezuelan sources said on condition of anonymity that
the discussions centered on a cease-fire, which the right-wing
Salvadoran government considers essential to test the guerrillas'
good faith.
   The leftist guerrillas have consistently rejected that proposal
unless the government guarantees to fire elements of the armed
forces allegedly involved in human rights violations.
   The obstacles at the talks were underlined Wednesday as
Salvadoran President Alfredo Christiani sharply criticized the
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front for
leaking their position to the Salvadoran press.
   The guerrillas demand a demilitarization of Salvadoran society,
full democratization of their country and a national economic pact.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Told Huge Cuts Could Harm Economy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 17-19: ``Darman provided,'' with White House
examples of Gramm-Rudman cuts</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the White House and Congress
were urged Thursday to seek deficit savings of $50 billion to $60
billion but avoid more drastic steps that might send the economy
into a slowdown.
   Officials from the administration and the Congressional Budget
Office gave the negotiators widely differing projections about the
size of the growing federal deficit.
   But both sides agreed that cuts of $50 billion to $60 billion
would not be enough to head off automatic spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. Some negotiators have said
loosening the deficit targets in the law could be one way of
dealing with that problem.
   ``We're still trying to find out what the facts are,'' House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said after Thursday's 90
minutes of closed-door talks.
   ``Then we'll set the goals we're trying to achieve, then we'll
talk about ways to reach the goals.''
   Congressional aides said it was likely to be several days before
a detailed proposal for spending cuts or tax increases surfaced in
the talks. The meetings began Tuesday after President Bush set
aside his campaign pledge of no new taxes and said there would be
no preconditions to the negotiations.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman led the president's
team into the negotiations.
   Participants at the talks heard differing projections about the
likely size of the 1991 deficit without tax hikes or spending cuts.
   According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, it
will take $85 billion to $95 billion in savings to reach the $64
billion target in the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget presented
figures showing that $59 billion to $74 billion would be needed.
   But Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, and White House budget chief Richard Darman agreed that to
cut next year's shortfall by more than $50 billion or $60 billion _
about 1 percent of the economy _ could contribute to an economic
slowdown.
   A leading Democratic negotiator concurred. ``It is legitimate to
ask the question, at what point do you begin to undermine the
economy in terms of too many taxes and too many cuts,'' said Rep.
Leon Panetta.
   Accepting the lower target presumably would make the work of the
negotiators easier and lead to less politically painful remedies.
   Neither agency's figures included the costs of rescuing the
nation's ailing savings and loan industry. CBO calculated that when
those expenses are included, the amount of required deficit cuts
could explode to $132 billion to $182 billion. The Gramm-Rudman law
requires that the costs of the savings and loan bailout be included
in calculations of the deficit.
   When Bush unveiled his budget in January, he said that just $37
billion in cuts would be needed to satisfy the Gramm-Rudman law.
   ``What we're seeing today is the administration abandoning their
rosy scenario,'' said one of the Democratic negotiators, Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser of Tennessee.
   Darman provided the negotiators with examples of the automatic
spending cuts the Gramm-Rudman law would impose next year if a
compromise deficit-reduction package was not worked out.
   He said that if $30 billion in cuts were required, defense
spending would be cut by 7.6 percent and domestic programs by 10.4
percent. If $60 billion in reductions were necessary, the slice
would be 15.2 percent for the military and 22.2 percent for
domestic programs.
   As examples, he said that with $30 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts,
the FBI's $1.4 billion budget would be cut by $81 million. The
Federal Aviation Administration's $6.5 billion budget would be
reduced by $126 million and the Pentagon's $80.8 billion
procurement efforts would be cut by $2.1 billion. For technical
reasons, the Gramm-Rudman cuts are applied differently to various
programs.
   The talks resumed as Democrats questioned Bush's willingness to
embrace politically unpopular spending cuts.
   Bush has rejected Democratic calls for him to take the lead in
proposing a solution, and lawmakers suggested before Thursday's
negotiations began that the president might not be willing to
accept deep spending cuts.
   ``It's premature to know that,'' said Gephardt, he top
Democratic negotiator.
   Panetta said he believed Bush would be willing to support
whatever proposal emerges.
   But he added, ``There's a lot of skepticism around this place
whether or not they'll be willing to grab this tar baby in the
end.''
   Panetta, who also is among the negotiators, complained that
partisan dueling is hindering negotiators and could jeopardize the
talks' outcome. He said such pressures were likely to grow during
the course of this election year.
   ``We're trying to walk through it, and you have the Hatfields
and the McCoys firing shots over our heads,'' he said.
   Even House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who normally avoids
political finger-pointing, was drawn into the fray.
   On Wednesday, Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., had said Democratic
calls for Bush to make a televised address on the deficit were an
effort to force him to ``do a Jimmy Carter.'' That was a reference
to the former president's unpopular penchant of reminding the
nation of its problems.
   Asked about the remark, Foley responded, ``Does that mean
exercising presidential leadership?''
   The projected size of next year's deficit has grown because of
unexpectedly high interest rates, growing costs of handling the
savings and loan industry collapse, and lower-than-expected tax
revenues.

<HEAD>Maoist Rebel Faction in Peru Says It Will Suspend Fighting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is a writethru to a0673 to add presidential poll result

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maoist rebel faction said Thursday it is
suspending military actions while it reviews its anti-government
struggle, but it vowed to resume its armed insurgency.
   In leaflets found in the Andean city of Ayacucho on Thursday,
the 10th anniversary of the Shining Path uprising, rebels who
claimed to represent a splinter faction of the group said it will
lay down arms to ``evaluate all our brilliant actions of the decade
and then return with new impulses and ideas.''
   It said it would take up arms again ``soon.''
   The leaflets were found near where a bomb exploded early
Thursday. The bomb's target, the offices of presidential candidate
Alberto Fujimori's Change 90 party, was slightly damaged, but no
one was reported injured.
   A survey of Lima-area voters released Thursday showed Fujimori
trailing novelist Mario Vargas Llosa by nearly 5 percentage points
in the most recent survey of Lima-area voters.
   The center-right Vargas Llosa is favored by 46.3 percent of
voters, to 41.7 percent who support the centrist Fujimori,
according to a poll of 484 people made last weekend by the private
firm Datum. The poll had a 4.6 percent margin of error.
   About one-third of Peru's 22 million people live in the Lima
area.
   The runoff election is set for June 10. Vargas Llosa narrowly
won the most votes, with Fujimori right behind him, in last month's
primary but many thought his support had eroded in recent weeks.
   The winner must deal with Peru's poor economic situation and the
continuing Shining Path insurgency. More than 18,000 people have
been killed in political violence since the Shining Path took up
arms 10 years ago.
   There have been reports in recent weeks in the Lima press of a
schism within the Ayacucho branch of the Shining Path. The Andean
city, 235 miles southeast of Lima, is the movement's birthplace and
remains its stronghold.
   However, analysts who study the rebel movement say the division
is unlikely to significantly weaken the guerrillas.
   In an indication of divisions within the movement, the rebel
leaflets made no direct mention of the shadowy Shining Path leader
Abimail Guzman. Instead, they called for an end to ``personality
cults and ideological fundamentalism.''
   Guzman, a former philosophy professor, is believed to advocate
extreme violence.
   In past years, the rebel group has carried out numerous
massacres of mountain peasants it viewed as traitors to its cause.
   The splinter group's leaflets criticized ``mass genocides,
especially when they involve workers and peasants.'' It said such
actions undercut grassroots support.

   Exterior lights and marquees at resorts along
the Las Vegas Strip will go dark for 10 minutes Friday night in
memory of Sammy Davis Jr., the star who entertained millions in
this city over four decades.
   Davis died of cancer at his Beverly Hills, Calif., home
Wednesday. Funeral services are scheduled Friday.
   Lights along the Strip were darkened after the assassinations of
President John Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr.
   Debbie Munch, a spokeswoman for Caesars Palace, said that resort
would darken all non-essential exterior lights from 9 to 9:10 p.m.
Friday in honor of Davis.
   ``He was the dearest song and dance man this city has ever
seen,'' Ms. Munch said. ``We owe him this tribute.''
   Don Payne, head of the Las Vegas News Bureau, said all hotels on
the glittering Strip were being urged to join in the tribute.
   ``It's one way for this town to show the respect that we all owe
Sammy Davis Jr.,'' Payne said Thursday. ``This city has particular
reason to honor this man.''
   ``Sammy Davis represented a significant part of the
entertainment world for many decades and this is our way of
thanking him,'' said Ira David Sternberg, a spokesman at the
Tropicana Hotel.
   Davis was one of the city's top entertainers and was a member of
the famed Rat Pack in the 1950s, joining Frank Sinatra, Dean
Martin, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop in appearances at the Sands
Hotel.
   He last appeared here with comedian Jerry Lewis at Bally's Hotel
in July of 1989, shortly before he quit performing because of
throat cancer.

   The House approved an amendment Thursday
permitting food service workers with AIDS to be assigned duties
that would keep them away from hanbdling food.
   By a 199-187 vote, the House agreed to change the proposed
Americans with Disabilities Act, a bill aimed at protecting the
rights of the disabled, to allow employers to reassign workers with
``contagious diseases'' so they will not be allowed to handle food.
   Both sides agreed that ``contagious disease'' referred primarily
to AIDS, which can be spread only by intimate sexual contact or by
sharing hypodermic needles or blood.
   Among those voting for the amendment were 79 Democrats.
Thirty-one Republicans opposed it.
   The amendment means the bill, once it passes the House, will
have to go to a conference committee to work out differences.
Backers of the measure had hoped to avoid having to submit the bill
to such negotiations.
   ``I'm sure the Senate will now ask for a conference because this
amendment will not be acceptable,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer,
D-Md., lead House sponsor. Hoyer called the provision the ``Jim
Crow amendment of 1990.''
   The analogy follows repeated descriptions of the bill as the
most significant piece of civil rights legislation since the 1960s.
   ``The vote was a significant setback in the progress that has
been made over the past several years'' in understanding AIDS, said
spokesman Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a
gay-rights group that lobbied against the amendment.
   The bill easily cleared the Senate last September on a 76-8
vote. That bill was the product of delicate negotiations with the
White House. The House version nearly duplicated the Senate bill.
   The White House had endorsed the bill for its protection of AIDS
victims along with other disabled people. However, its position on
the amendment, whose existence was long known, was not clearly
stated until Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
wrote a letter Thursday to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   ``Food service workers infected with HIV need not be restricted
from work unless they have other infections or illnesses for which
any food service worker should be restricted,'' Sullivan said.
``Since the act limits coverage for persons who pose a direct
threat to others, relaxing the anti-discrimination protection for
food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the
protection of the public health.''
   But the argument boiled down to public fears as opposed to
scientific evidence.
   ``Perception is reality,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.,
arguing that restaurants which let AIDS victims handle food would
be driven out of business.
   ``We need to look at reality as it exists today,'' said Rep.
Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, ``not as we wish it to exist.''
   ``In effect, it says there's a prejudice out there and let's
pander to it,'' countered Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., invoking the
memory of Ryan White, the Indiana youth who recently died as a
result of AIDS acquired through a transfusion.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Cali., said he believed the amendment
stemmed from misunderstanding of the bill. The bill contains a
provision that exempts any person whose condition or conduct poses
a ``direct threat'' to others.
   The bill was hailed during opening debate as legislation ``whose
time has come.'' The bill extends to people with AIDS, blindness,
cerebral palsy and a number of other mental and physical
impairments the protections accorded racial minorities and women.
   The House also passed a pair of amendments favoring business,
including one giving small businesses temporary immunity from
discrimination lawsuits. It rejected one giving a pay-based formula
for determining whether businesses have spent enough to accommodate
disabled employees.
   Backers say the legislation is necessary to push the estimated
43 million disabled Americans into the economic and social
mainstream. The cost to the government is small, topping out at $31
million in 1994. The cost to business has not been calculated.
   Supporters say also that the cost will be offset by the addition
of disabled people to the work force and the consumer economy.
   The bill prohibits discrimination in all phases of life:
Employment, access to stores and services, transportation and
telecommunications.
   Among key provisions:
   _Discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited.
The requirement would be phased in over two to four years,
depending on the size of the company. Companies with fewer than 15
employers would be exempt.
   _Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business
and professional offices, along with any other ``public
accommodation,'' would have to make themselves accessible to
disabled people. Accessibility includes structural adjustments,
such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors, and services.
   _Transportation, public and private, would have to be made
accessible. Fixed route bus systems would have to be accessible for
people with wheelchairs. Special ``paratransit'' would be available
for people with other disabilities who cannot use regular
transit.'' Amtrak, Greyhound, and commuter rail systems are
covered. Timetables for implementation vary according to system.
   _Speech- and hearing-impaired people would have access to
telephone service by means of relay services. These services would
have to be provided by phone companies within three years. The
Federal Communications Commission would have jurisdiction.

   The half-hour shows, hosted by Alex Trebek and Michael Reilly,

   King World said its ABC game shows will be on for 13 weeks, but
a network spokewoman here said she couldn't confirm that.
   According to ABC, the programs are the first game shows on the

<HEAD>Church of Ireland Votes for Ordination of Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Anglican Church of Ireland
gave final approval Thursday to the ordination of women as priests.
   Lay and clergy delegates to the church's general synod voted in
favor of the change for the second time this week, approving the
last stage of the bill.
   Anglicans in England, Scotland and Wales do not allow women to
be priests. About 1,000 women have been ordained to the priesthood
in one-quarter of the 27 Anglican churches, most of them in the
United States, Canada and New Zealand.
   On Tuesday, clerical members of the church secured the necessary
two-thirds majority by four votes, but there had been speculation
Thursday's follow-up vote would reverse that decision.
   Delegates instead heeded a strongly worded request from
Archbishop Robin Eames of Armagh, the leader of the church, to vote
to ensure the bill's passage.
   The proposal was backed overwhelmingly by lay voters and by
almost 70 percent of the clergy.
   The Church of Ireland has 410,000 members, most of them in the
British province of Northern Ireland.
   Church officials said it will probably be months before any
women become priests. There are six woman deacons and four in
training.
   The majority of Ireland's population belong to the Roman
Catholic Church, which opposes the ordination of women.

   Police on Thursday sought a man whose
elderly parents' bodies were found in the trunk of an abandoned
car, along with that of his 93-year-old grandmother, authorities
said.
   The bodies were discovered Wednesday in a car registered to one
of the victims, Forest Janes, 78, officials said. Also killed were
Janes' wife, Una, 72, and her mother, Ivy Welch.
   Illinois authorities requested an arrest warrant for
investigation of murder for the Janes' 35-year-old son, Ronald J.
Janes, who reportedly lived with his adoptive parents in rural
Bradbury, Ill., about 100 miles west of Indianapolis.
   ``We regard him as a prime suspect in the case,'' Illinois State
Police spokesman Bob Fletcher said in Springfield. ``The last time
he was seen was on Sunday in Indianapolis with the car.''
   The bodies were found after employees of a nearby restaurant
told authorities a foul odor was coming from the black 1984 Lincoln
Continental first seen in a downtown parking lot Monday,
Indianapolis police Lt. William M. Reardon said.
   Autopsies conducted Thursday determined that all three victims
died of severe head injuries suffered in a beating, said Marion
County Coroner Dennis Nicholas.
   ``They all died very violent, brutal deaths,'' Nicholas said.
   He said the women were easily recognizable, but the man's head
was severed and the victim was too badly beaten to be recognized.
   A pair of scissors was found sticking from Mrs. Janes' chest.
Mrs. Welch's was found with a trash bag over her head and a hole in
her abdomen.
   ``We found a pipe wrench and a 30-inch long piece of galvanized
pipe, which were probably the murder weapons,'' said Nicholas. He
said the victims probably died last Thursday or Friday.
   Relatives reported the victims missing Saturday, authorities
said.
   Reardon said the evidence indicated the slayings occurred in
Illinois, and said it was possible the bodies were put in the car
and driven around for a few days.
   Police said they had no motive for the killings and were unsure
why Ronald Janes might have traveled to Indianapolis. His ex-wife
lives in the area, but Reardon said Janes had not contacted her for
two years.
   Janes was thought to have been seen at a motel and a bar on
Sunday, said Indianapolis police Detective Craig Converse.
   Janes has a criminal history that includes theft, forgery and
battery dating from 1973, Illinois police said. He also is wanted
on an arrest warrant for forgery in Illinois.
   ``His parents were aware of his problems with ... forged
checks,'' said Special Agent Frederick J. Bray of the Illinois
State Police.

   Mills College students, sensing victory
over a decision to admit undergraduate men, ended a two-week
barricade of administration buildings Thursday.
   Meanwhile, alumnae met secretly to discuss a financial rescue
plan that would add millions of dollars to the college's coffers.
   The student protesters walked out of three administration
buildings and held an afternoon rally on the Toyon Meadow, the main
lawn of the campus.
   The college's alumnae organization has raised $3 million in a
seven-day telephone fund drive, bolstering students' hopes that the
college's board of trustees would reverse an earlier vote to admit
men starting in the fall of 1991.
   The board is expected to meet Friday to decide whether to accept
an alumnae rescue plan that includes adding $10 million to the
college's endowment and doubling the association's yearly gift to
the college.

   Art Buchwald has attacked Paramount Pictures'
claim that the hit Eddie Murphy movie ``Coming to America'' lost
$18 million, contending in court papers that the movie actually
made $39.8 million.
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider ruled in January that
Paramount must pay Buchwald $250,000 and 19 percent of the film's
net profits. Paramount has said it will appeal the decision.
   Buchwald claimed the studio stole his script idea titled ``King
For A Day,'' which dealt with an African prince who comes to live
in the United States. The film's credits attributed the idea to
Murphy.
   In papers filed Wednesday, the humorist's attorney Pierce
O'Donnell said the share of the net profit due his client and
producer Alan Bernheim should range between $6.9 million and $14.6
million.
   ``The studio's reaction is that their claims are baseless and
unfounded,'' said Robert Schwartz, an attorney for Paramount.
   Paramount has claimed it lost $18 million on ``Coming to
America,'' even though the 1988 film has grossed $275 million
worldwide.
   Buchwald's audit, which covers the period up to December of last
year, states that producing ``Coming to America'' cost Paramount
$22.9 million. A Paramount audit put the figure at $58.5 million.
   Papers filed by O'Donnell said several items that Paramount
listed in the cost of making the movie should not have been
included.
   Among them were $1 million for Murphy's entourage; $900,000 for
excessive fringe benefits and a 15 percent ``overhead'' charge that
amounted to $8 million of the costs all by itself.
   The brief said $1.65 million of the $8 million overhead ``was
merely for writing gross participation checks to Eddie Murphy and
(director) John Landis.''

<HEAD>North Carolina Marine From Pennsylvania Charged in Pentagon Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine Corps sergeant has been charged with
stealing government property and accused of taking two computers
and 60 floppy disks of secret data from the ``Star Wars'' office at
the Pentagon, the Defense Department announced Thursday.
   A statement from the department's inspector general identified
the suspect as Sgt. Robert Walter Rodgers, 27, originally from
Upper Darby, Pa. and now based at Camp LeJeune, N.C.
   Rodgers was indicted by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va.,
on four counts charging theft of government and personal property,
depredation (plundering) against government property and
destruction of records, the IG said.
   The computers and disks have not been recovered. Investigators
considered the possiblity that they had been turned over to a
foreign power, but ``it is unlikely,'' said Michael J. Costello,
head of the Washington office of the Defense Criminal Investigative
Service.
   Costello said the disks contained ``some sensitive SDI
information.''
   According to the inspector general's account, Rodgers was a
part-time employee of Polaris Corp., a contractor providing
security services to the Strategic Defense Initiative Office in the
Pentagon.
   On April 8, 1988, according to the statement, Rodgers
``crashed'' _ disabled _ the computer controlling access to the
office, entered a storage room and removed the computers, one of
them an officer's personal machine, and the disks.
   Investigators took the hard _ built-in _ disk of the disabled
computer to its manufacturer and consulted writers of the programs
it used to reconstruct events before the break-in, and thus were
able to bring Rodgers under suspicion, Costello said.
   ``Rodgers apparently thought he could erase all incriminating
activity. He is a very computer-literate person,'' Costello said.

   The 21-year-old son of a former Panamanian
president was found innocent Thursday of threatening to kill
President Bush.
   Otto Lakas, an architecture student at Lubbock Christian
University, could have faced a 5-year prison term had he been
convicted in U.S. District Court.
   Lakas, the son of Demetrio B. Lakas, president of Panama from
1972-78, clenched his fists and looked toward the ceiling, tears
rolling down his cheeks as the verdict was read. The jury
deliberated only 15 minutes.
   ``I am very happy,'' Lakas said leaving the courthouse. ``I
don't want to comment any more than that, but I am glad to go back
home.''
   Government prosecutors refused to comment about the decision.
   ``I am so relieved,'' said the elder Lakas, who testified
Thursday that his son was on trial because of a misunderstanding of
his people's culture.
   ``We always talk about killing someone. Even two or three times.
Latins are fiery and outspoken,'' he told jurors. ``But it is not
taken seriously. It's a way of expressing ourselves,'' he said
under cross-examination.
   Demetrio Lakas had testified for the defense Wednesday that his
son Otto grew up amid death threats in Panama.
   ``My life was threatened thousands of times,'' Lakas said.
   Otto Lakas was accused of threatening Bush in a discussion with
the managers of a pawnshop where he was looking at a gun.
   Prior to the verdict, which came in the second day of the trial,
family and friends testified about the non-aggressive nature of
Lakas. They characterized the statements as a joke.
   But Secret Service agents took Lakas at his word and had jailed
him without bond since April 17.
   When Lakas was asked if he had any regrets about the threat and
his arrest, he replied: ``You bet, never again. I know the law
now.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany's interior minister wants
to hire former leading Communist spy Markus Wolf as a special
adviser, but angry West German officials said Thursday that Wolf
should be prosecuted instead.
   Wolf, 67, was purportedly the role model for the wily Communist
spy Karla in John le Carre's espionage novels.
   Carl-Dieter Spranger, parliamentary state secretary in West
Germany's Interior Ministry, said Wolf is ``not acceptable for
office in a democracy.'' He said East German Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel's idea to hire him is ``unbearable.''
   Before he retired in 1987, Wolf was chief of foreign
intelligence within Communist East Germany's Ministry for State
Security, which also contained the infamous ``Stasi'' domestic
secret police.
   The ministry was dissolved last year in East Germany's quiet
revolution that ended four decades of hard-line Communist
leadership.
   During his 33-year career, Wolf earned a reputation in the West
as one of the craftiest intelligence foes. He is wanted by West
Germany.
   But Wolf was also one of the first senior Communist Party
officials to call for democratic changes within his homeland. Wolf
last year even joined activists in addressing pro-democracy street
demonstrators.
   In a telefax to Western news media, Diestel defended his plan to
hire Wolf, saying he would be invaluable in helping clear up the
activities of the Stasi.
   Diestel said he wants to ensure that a Ministry for State
Security can never arise again, and for that reason asked Wolf ``to
lay open his knowledge and make it available to the new
government.''
   Eduard Lintner, a political expert for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government, urged ``serious consideration whether Diestel
is still acceptable as interior minister, or must be let go,''
reported the newspaper Bild.
   The newspaper telexed to news agencies in advance an article
that is to appear in Friday's editions.
   It quoted Volker Ruehe, head of Kohl's Christian Democrats, as
saying Wolf is ``less suited as an adviser than anyone I can think
of.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Philippine negotiators met
Friday for a fifth day of talks on the future of American bases in
the Philippines after a late-night marathon session failed to
produce a breakthrough.
   Early Friday, unknown assailants fired two grenades at a U.S
government library in suburban Makati, one of which exploded,
causing minor damage. The library had not yet opened, and there
were no injuries, police said.
   The two sides disagree on whether the United States failed to
make full aid payments, and on when the facilities would actually
have to close if the two sides cannot reach a lease agreement.
   After this round of talks, which is to end Friday, the two sides
could either begin formal negotiations on a new pact or start
working on a schedule for closing the bases. Their lease expires in
September 1991.
   The installations include Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller facilities.
   Police said three masked men dressed in black fired two grenades
about 6 a.m. from a taxi at the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center,
operated by the U.S. Information Service.
   Police said the attack could have been timed to the bases talks.
   The two sides met into the evening Thursday to try to resolve a
Philippine claim that the United States owes $222 million in back
payments for use of the bases.
   U.S. officials said the talks resumed early Friday in hopes of a
compromise before chief U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage leaves for
Tokyo later in the day.
   ``We are trying to hammer out differences,'' said Philippine
spokesman Rafael Alunan on Thursday. ``I believe that they are
inching toward some sort of agreement'' on the payment issue.
   In 1988, the Reagan administration agreed to provide $962
million over two years in return for use of the bases through 1991.
Congress subsequently cut the Bush administration's aid request by
$96 million.
   U.S. officials insist they promised only ``best efforts'' to
meet the target and that the aid cut was not a breach of faith.
   ``We have not conceded that there is a shortfall,'' said the
spokesman for the U.S. delegation, Stanley Schrager. ``We have
lived up to our commitment, and we have made our best effort.''
   President Corazon Aquino suggested Thursday the United States
could pay off the ``debt'' by providing medical equipment and other
supplies to the Philippines.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was willing to provide additional equipment to the
Philippines, but that it would not be designated as payment of any
debt.
   A classified memorandum prepared in February by the Philippines'
Department of Foreign Affairs suggested the government publicly
demand full U.S. funding for the bases as well as other aid
programs, while quietly agreeing to accept a lower aid figure.
   The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
also said the United States was reluctant to increase aid to the
Philippines because of perceived weak leadership and mismanagement
by the Aquino government.
   Mrs. Aquino said Thursday it was too early to say whether the
two sides had reached an impasse.
   However, Philippine senators, who must ratify any new bases
agreement, expressed renewed doubts any pact could win approval.
   Sen. John Osmena, the leading bases advocate in the Senate, told
reporters Thursday: ``The ball is in the U.S. court. If they want
to stay, they have to pay.''
   Senate President Jovito Salonga said rather than trying to come
to terms with the United States, the Philippines ``should now
prepare for the next phase and try to effectuate a smooth turnover
of the military bases.''
   The Philippine government says the lease on the installations
expires in September 1991, but the United States claims the bases
could remain one year longer under the current agreement.
   President Bush has said he would study alternative locations for
the bases if the negotiations fail.

   Severe thunderstorms soaked much of the nation Thursday, while
the South and parts of the Plains still braced for the inundation
of rising rivers.
   Tornado watches were posted Thursday night for central and
eastern Pennsylvania, central and southeastern New York state, and
much of New Jersey.
   Warnings of gale force winds stood through the night for the
Great Lakes region and across the lower Great Lakes on Friday.
Winds reached 61 mph at Buffalo, N.Y.
   Flood watches were in effect for New York state, Vermont and New
Jersey. Heavy rain from strong thunderstorms could cause serious
local flooding problems.
   Major flooding continued on the lower half of the middle Red
River. The river is expected to stay at its crest at Coushatta,
La., through Friday, about 6{ feet above flood stage.
   Flood warnings continued for the Little River near and below
Rochelle, La., as well as along the Red River to where it joins the
Black River.
   Flood warnings remained along the Sabine, Neches, and Angelina
rivers in east Texas, as well as the Trinity and Leon rivers in
north Texas.
   Warnings also continued along the Wabash River from Mount
Carmel, Ill., to New Harmony, Ind. The river is expected to crest
about the middle of next week, at its highest stage since March
1985.
   Flooding extended along the Sangamon River from near Lake
Decatur, Ill., to the river's mouth.
   Recent heavy rains led to predictions of additional flooding on
the Black River at Pocahontas and Black Rock, both in Arkansas, and
on the St. Francis River at St. Francis, La. Flooding continued
along the White River in eastern Arkansas and the ouachita river
near the Arkansas-Louisiana border.
   The crest on the Missouri River was expected to be eight feet
over flood stage at Booneville, Mo., on Friday. The Cuive River was
seven feet over flood stage at Troy, Mo.
   Flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in Texas and one in
Oklahoma in the past three weeks, and millions of dollars in
damage. In Texas, 33 counties have been declared eligible for
disaster aid due to storms and flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across much of New England,
New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and parts of
Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia
and Alabama.
   Showers also reached along the Louisiana coast, the central
Texas Gulf coast, and along the northern Pacific Coast. Rain was
scattered from north-central Minnesota to west-central Wisconsin,
and northern Lower Michigan.
   Casper, Wyo., reached 28 degrees Thursday morning and tied its
low temperature record for the date, set in 1986.
   The nation's low temperature was 20 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38 degrees at Warroad,
Minn. to 95 at Avos Park, Fla.

   Former President Juan
Bosch, falling behind in partial electoral returns, accused
President Joaquin Balaguer of ``colossal fraud'' Thursday and
threatened street demonstrations.
   Bosch, a leftist, told reporters he would lead the street
protests on Friday ``no matter what the consequences.''
   He called a news conference after results from Wednesday's
general election announced by the electoral board showed Balaguer,
a five-time president, had overtaken Bosch's narrow early lead.
   With nearly two-thirds of this Caribbean country's polling
stations reporting results, the outcome remained uncertain, with
the two rival candidates in a close race.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind from glaucoma, and Bosch, 80, who has
moderated his leftist ideology in recent years, were opposing each
other for the fifth time for the presidency of this nation of 7
million people. Balaguer won three of those previous elections.
   ``The Central Electoral Board and Dr. Balaguer committed a
colossal fraud,'' Bosch said Thursday.
   ``We are announcing that PDL is going into the streets because
the people have been cheated.''
   PDL are the Spanish initials for Bosch's leftist Dominican
Liberation Party.
   ``Tomorrow we will be ready to go with the people into the
streets, no matter what the consequences,'' Bosch said. ``What
remains of my life has no meaning if this fraud takes place.''
   The electoral board later issued a statement saying election law
prohibited such demonstrations while the vote count was still under
way.
   Radio and television stations were barred from carrying
newscasts during the election period, so Dominicans were not
generally aware of his call for demonstrations.
   Officials of Bosch's party met Thursday with six of the 30
international observers monitoring the election. Oscar Ayerve of
Ecuador said there was concern over the slow vote count, but he did
not elaborate.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, one of the observers, was in the
computer room at election headquarters and unavailable for comment.
He said earlier the balloting was fair, but gave no assessment of
the count.
   Bosch, who was overthrown in a 1963 military coup, held a narrow
lead earlier. The electoral board announced results of Wednesday's
election by party, rather than by candidate.
   With 3,914 the 6,663 polling stations reporting, Balaguer had
386,766 votes and Bosch 375,869, official returns showed. A former
socialist mayor of Santo Domingo, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, was
third with 256,243 votes.
   The two leading parties both claimed victory.
   Bosch supporters celebrated at party headquarters early Thursday
despite the uncertain outcome. Sen. Felix Jimenez, Bosch's campaign
manager, said Balaguer should ``recognize his defeat at the polls.''
   ``There is not doubt we have won the elections,'' said
Balaguer's running mate, Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso. He
based his claim on results showing the Social Christian Reformist
Party ahead in 18 of the country's 29 provinces and in the federal
district of Santo Domingo.
   Balaguer's supporters held a vigil at his Santo Domingo
residence. Soldiers patrolled the neighborhood.
   Most shops in the capital remained closed for a second day. No
disturbances were reported.
   Returns from the capital of Santo Domingo, with a population of
2 million, were delayed by a computer problem, election officials
said. Those results could strongly affect the outcome because
Balaguer has done poorly in the capital in previous elections.
   About 3.2 million people were registered to vote nationwide.
   ``The election has been conducted in an adequate and honest
manner,'' Carter said in a statement read on television.
   Eighteen parties contested Wednesday's general election, but
only eight put forward their own presidential candidates. Among the
10 that did not, four declared in advance that all votes for their
party would go to Balaguer and one committed its votes to Bosch.
   Bosch, an author and intellectual who describes himself as a
Marxist but not a Communist, ran on a moderate platform. He pledged
to work for good relations with the United States and endorsed
capitalism as the best way to improve his country's economic plight.
   Bosch and the army hierarchy have been at odds since he was
overthrown in a military coup 27 years ago. But military officers
and Balaguer stated before the elections they would respect the
outcome of the vote.
   An attempt by an army faction to restore the Bosch presidency
after his ouster led to civil war in 1965. President Lyndon Johnson
sent in 23,000 U.S. Marines to prevent a leftist takeover.
   Balaguer, founder and leader of the Social Christian Reformist
Party, rose to power under dictator Gen. Rafael Trujillo, serving
briefly as his figurehead president. Trujillo ruled for 31 years
until his assassination in 1961.
   Balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served three
consecutive four-year terms before losing in 1978. He was
re-elected in 1986.
   The president pinned his hopes in this election largely on a $2
billion public-works project to transform centuries-old Santo
Domingo. He portrayed Bosch as a dangerous Marxist.
   Balaguer's public-works project has created thousands of jobs,
but his popularity slumped as the country's economic problems
deepened.

   Cable television magnate Ted Turner said Thursday
he never meant to condone the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in China, and he hopes to meet with one of the
student leaders who criticized his comments.
   Turner, creator of the international Cable News Network, told
foreign journalists in Beijing last week that the Chinese
government ``felt forced to'' call in troops to stop the mass
demonstrations last year.
   He also said the students who occupied central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square for weeks ``were breaking the law,'' and he said
the United States was interfering in the business of another
country when it disapproved of the Chinese government's actions.
   ``That statement was made in a question-and-answer format,''
Turner said Thursday after returning to Atlanta. ``In no way did I
wish to condone the violence there.
   ``Everyone there knows I'm an advocate of peace. I was upset
about it, too. It not only hurt the people involved, but the
government as well.''
   Turner commented following a brief news conference in which he
signed 7-foot-7 wrestler Jorge Gonzalez to a contract with World
Championship Wrestling Inc., a subsidiary of his Turner
Broadcasting System.
   Shen Tong, a leader of China's student pro-democracy movement,
who escaped the country after the massacre, told reporters during a
visit to Atlanta last weekend that he was upset by Turner's remarks
and wanted to meet with Turner personally.
   ``If I get a chance, I will meet with him,'' Turner said
Thursday. ``I plan to see him.''

<TEXT>
   A former Northrop Corp. plant chief who
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud in supplying untested cruise
missile guidance system parts was sentenced Thursday to three years
in prison.
   Clarence Gonsalves, 62, also was fined $10,000 by U.S. District
Judge Pamela Rymer. Gonsalves was once manager of Northrop's
now-closed Western Services Department.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey said Gonsalves' sentence
could have been longer if he had not agreed to cooperate with U.S.
authorities investigating the matter.
   About 1,700 flight data transmitters were made at Western
Services for the air-launched cruise missile, which can carry
either conventional or nuclear warheads. Many were delivered
untested and below specifications.
   ``It's a very big and serious question mark'' over the
performance of the missiles, said Fahey.
   Northrop and Boeing, the prime contractors in the cruise missile
program, are testing missiles to see if their guidance system works.
   Fahey credited Gonsalves' cooperation with forcing Northrop to
reach a plea agreement with prosecutors over the matter.
   The defense company pleaded guilty to 34 counts of fraud and
agreed to pay $17 million to the government. Gonsalves also is
cooperating in a parallel ``whistleblower'' civil case against
Northrop over the cruise missile parts.

   Teen-age customers of some record store chains
now need more than money to buy certain hot LPs. They need ID.
   Bowing to pressure from politicians and parents over what they
consider objectionable lyrics, some stores have begun to card
youngsters.
   In some places, no one under 18 can buy products by rap and
heavy metal acts that carry a warning label affixed by record
companies.
   ``This stuff is addictive,'' says state Rep. Jean Dixon, a fan
of Christian music whose attempt to force record companies to label
albums with explicit material failed in committee. ``I had a kid
write and tell me he's addicted to this bad music.''
   Whether record companies and retailers agree with her premise or
not, some are complying. Among them: Dallas-based Sound Warehouse
Inc., which has 137 stores in 14 states, and Streetside Records,
which has 19 stores in Missouri and Kansas.
   Camelot Music, the No. 2 company in the country, carded minors
for several months before going to a money-back guarantee last
month for dissatisfied parents.
   ``We've been carding kids for about two months, ever since Jean
Dixon started her spiel,'' said Jim Varvaris, manager of a
Streetside store in St. Louis County. ``Some of her comments show
that she's kind of hogwash.''
   Targets of the measure agree.
   ``It's a crock,'' said 17-year-old Matt Lauman of St. Louis,
standing outside a Camelot outlet.
   ``We talk about this stuff in social studies all the time,''
said 14-year-old Megan Engbert of St. Louis. ``It's not fair.''
   The number of albums and tapes that carry warning labels and
necessitate carding is small. Varvaris said that of 75 new releases
his store received Monday, only two needed stickers.
   Profanity and references to suicide, abortion and sex are on
Dixon's hit list.
   ``I think that's an excellent move on the part of the
retailer,'' said Dixon. ``I'm sure our efforts here had something
to do with that. I'm very pleased with that and all parents should
be, too _ that's fantastic.''
   Four years ago, the Recording Industry Association of America,
under pressure from the Parents' Music Resource Center headed by
Tipper Gore, added warning stickers to certain albums. Mrs. Gore is
the wife of U.S. Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   That effort led to a wide variety of warnings, some smaller than
a postage stamp, before the industry settled earlier this year on a
standardized sticker.
   One popular rap album, ``Fear of a Black Planet'' by Public
Enemy, is on the restricted list. Both albums by heavy metal act
Guns N' Roses carry warning stickers that say they may contain
objectionable material.
   Another rap group, 2 Live Crew, attempts to evade the censors
with albums titled ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' and ``As Clean As
They Wanna Be.'' Songs such as ``Me So Horny'' and ``Dirty Nursery
Rhymes'' are gone from the G-rated version.
   Lawyers for the group have been in court in Broward County,
Fla., where sheriff's deputies had threatened to prosecute store
owners if they sell ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   A federal judge earlier this week declined to rule immediately
in a lawsuit brought by the group to restore the album to the
shelves.
   Another rapper, Ice-T, touts his latest album, ``Freedom of
Speech ... Just Watch What You Say,'' as X-rated. It carries the
warning: ``Some material may be x-tra hype and inappropriate for
squares and suckers.''
   Minors, adept at skirting the law to purchase alcohol, still are
getting their hands on albums by hanging around the parking lot and
persuading an adult to buy it for them.
   ``Actually, it's kind of funny,'' Varvaris said. ``They'll come
back in and say, `This is my brother, he's going to buy the tape
for me.'''
   Record salesmen also wonder what's next. Is a ratings board,
like that used for movies, inevitable? Will record labeling reach
into the past and slap restrictions on albums from the 1960s like
``Blind Faith,'' which has a nude woman on the cover?
   ``Even the Beatles had explicit lyrics,'' salesman Stu Olson
said. ``I mean, where do you draw the line?''

<TEXT>
   George Drzewiecki, a Polish-born engineer who
designed Poland's first plane to cross the Atlantic, has died in
Ottawa. He was 87.
   Drzewiecki, who died Tuesday in a local hospital, moved to
Ottawa after World War II. Cause of death was not given.
   Poland twice honored Drzewiecki after the war for his aircraft
designs, said Anna Drzewiecki, his daughter.
   The British government recognized Drzewiecki's outstanding
wartime service as an Allied ferry pilot when he was made a Member
of the Order of the British Empire.
   ``Our father was an extremely humble man and would never tell us
anything,'' said Anna Drzewiecki, chief of plastic surgery at the
Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.
   In the 1930s, Drzewiecki designed more than 25 award-winning
planes, including light, aerobatic and touring aircraft. His
designs for a fighter and a bomber-trainer were destroyed when war
broke out with the invasion of Poland by Germany in September 1939.
   His most famous plane, the single-engined RWD-5, was the first
Polish aircraft to make a trans-Atlantic flight, his daughter said.
   As a ferry pilot in World WAR II, Drzewiecki flew damaged Allied
planes back to Britain from Europe for repairs.
   After the war, Drzewiecki moved to Canada and worked at the
National Research Council as a mechanical engineer until 1967. He
specialized in the installation of radar stations.
   Some of the radar equipment he designed was used as backup for
NORAD, the North American Air Defense command's northern warning
system.
   Drzewiecki is survived by his wife Jozefa, and daughters Anna,
Marta McDonald and Eva O'Grady.

   Demonstrators standing vigil at the Brooklyn
courthouse erupted in cheers and high-fives following the first
conviction in the Bensonhurst racial slaying, calling it a message
to the nation.
   ``We got him!'' one man shouted after learning that Joseph Fama,
a 19-year-old white man, had been convicted of second-degree murder
and 12 of 14 other counts in the shooting death of 16-year-old
Yusuf Hawkins, a black.
   Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of whites as
they walked through the mostly white Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn on Aug. 23.
   About 150 demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse
Thursday, including many who'd been there throughout the racially
charged trial and the 10 days of deliberations. Nearly all were
black.
   Just before the verdict came in, a squall hit the neighborhood.
But, as word of the decision arrived by bullhorn, skies cleared and
a shaft of sunlight struck the courthouse.
   Activists, who'd warned of unrest in the event of an acquittal,
greeted the verdict with glee.
   ``This will send a message,'' shouted Ron Jackson, a lawyer.
``It should cool the city this summer.''
   About 150 police officers were on the street outside the
courthouse and 150 on other streets nearby, with perhaps 150 news
reporters. There have been incidents of minor violence involving
demonstrators.
   Before word of the verdict arrived the mood was somber, but it
quickly turned to joy.
   ``You can smile now,'' one demonstrator, Ronald Anthony, told a
police chief who was standing before a line of officers. The chief
smiled.
   ``It made me feel that we can get along,'' said Anthony.
   Alfred Mohammed, a Muslim minister, echoed Anthony, saying the
verdict lessened tensions.
   Police Lt. Ray O'Donnell reported no trouble at the courthouse
Thursday. ``Things were calm,'' he said. ``We are very pleased.''
   As Hawkins' parents and supporters left the courthouse, the
cheering intensified. A small group chanted ``Yusuf, Yusuf, Yusuf''
and ``Guilty, Guilty, Guilty.''
   Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, joined in the chants, pumping
his fist in the air and smiling broadly before the family drove
away.
   A group of about demonstrators marched 100 yards to Borough Hall
and mounted the steps, carrying with them a makeshift coffin marked
with the names of victims of racial slayings.
   Before the verdict, Fama's construction worker father, Rocco,
said waiting for a decision had been tough and insisted again that
his son was innocent.
   ``I feel sorry for the guy who died,'' said the elder Fama. ``I
feel bad for the guy, I feel bad for my son.''
   The wait was over for Fama, but not for the parents of
19-year-old Keith Mondello, the defendant in a parallel trial in
the Bensonhurst case. The jury in Mondello's trial ended its
deliberations Thursday without reaching a verdict. Six other white
youths still face trial in the case.
   Since the beginning of Mondello's trial, parents Michael and
Susan Mondello have avoided speaking with reporters.
   ``They have their moments when they are hopeful by the questions
sent out by the jurors,'' said Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy.
``The tendency is to try to read more into it than is really
there.''
   ``The wear and tear is much more than the trial,'' he added.
``I'm exhausted from this.''

   The State Department warned Thursday that
there may be bombings and kidnappings in Peru over the next couple
of weeks in observance of the 10th anniversary of a Maoist rebel
group.
   The warning said the bombings by the ``Shining Path'' group may
be concentrated in Lima, the capital city, and in places frequented
by tourists.
   In addition, the State Department cautioned Americans in Peru
that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement may be planning to
kidnap foreigners, especially Americans. The department said that
information was obtained by the U.S. Embassy in Lima.

   The Energy Department has agreed to turn over
health records of a large fraction of its nuclear weapons workers
to a research group, the department said Thursday.
   The data had been sought in a lawsuit by the Three Mile Island
Public Health Fund, a group formed to study the health effects of
radioactivity after the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pa.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the department will sign an
agreement Friday to make the data available, said M.J. Jamison, a
department spokeswoman.
   ``It's a done deal. DOE is virtually giving up all the data they
were asked for,'' she said.
   The data were collected by department researchers at its
installations at
   Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Richland, Wash. and Los Alamos, N.M., covering
workers at those plants and at plants in Mound, Ohio and Rocky
Flats, Colo.
   Just how many records are involved was not immediately clear.
Ms. Jamison said she did not have a figure.
   She said 600,000 people had worked in the weapons plants of the
department and its predecessors since the 1942 organization of the
Manhattan Engineer District, the code name of the Army unit that
built the first atomic bombs in World War II.
   Previous reports have said the fund was seeking data on 300,000
workers.
   The two sides have agreed that the department may withhold
individual identifications such as names and social security
numbers, she said. These identifications had been sought in the
original lawsuit.
   The first release of records will be made 30 days after the
signing of the agreement Friday.
   The department had long resisted making the data available, but
last fall the Energy Secretary, Adm. James Watkins, hinted that he
would do so after an advisory committee said it should be done.
   The panel called for a policy of ``maximum possible openness.''

<TEXT>
   ST-AMABLE, Quebec (AP) _ The mayor of this farming center
outside Montreal advised residents of houses closest to a burning
tire dump to evacuate Thursday night, and about 100 people began
the exodus.
   Mayor Jacques Doyon suggested the residents move to hotels
because of a forecast change in the wind. Authorities said thick,
choking smoke from 3 million burning tires may start drifting their
way.
   ``We can't take chances so we are recommending evacuation,''
Doyon told a meeting of residents and journalists at the town hall
in this community of 5,000 people, 18 miles southeast of Montreal
and 50 miles from the U.S. border.
   He told residents the smoke was not toxic but contained
irritants that could cause coughs, nausea, eye problems and
headaches. He said elderly people and those who suffer from
respiratory or cardiac conditions would be at greater risk.
   A Quebec provincial police spokesman said about 100 people were
leaving their houses.
   Heavy rain poured down on the fire earlier Thursday, and
authorities said their strategy will be to contain the tire dump
blaze and then smother it with sand.
   The fire began Wednesday. It quickly spread over most of the
dump, an area the size of seven football fields, and sent up a
column of thick smoke more than 4,000 feet high.
   Dump trucks unloaded sand along the dump perimeter Thursday, to
be bulldozed onto the tires once the intensity of the fire dies
down.
   ``We're going to let it burn but at the same time control it,''
Richard Jette, a municipal councillor in the community.
   ``It has to burn for some time before we can get close to it and
eventually smother it.''
   The tires were stockpiled by St-Amable resident Jean-Paul
Mireault over the last 20 years, fire authorities said.
   Heavy equipment dug trenches around the dump Thursday to collect
the oily runoff from melting tires. The mass will be pumped into
tanker trucks before it can seep into the water table.

   Members of the British army
have passed intelligence papers to Protestant terrorists in
Northern Ireland, according to a special investigator Thursday.
   ``Certain members of the Ulster Defense Regiment have been
involved in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries,'' said John
Stevens, an English officer assigned to investigate claims by
loyalist gunmen they received police files.
   ``It would, however, be wrong to conclude that there is a
significant proportion of Ulster Defense Regiment soldiers who are
involved with paramilitaries. This is not the case,'' he said.
   Stevens said 94 people were arrested as a result of his
investigation, and 59 were charged or reported for criminal
offenses. He did not indicate how many of those were Ulster Defense
Regiment members.
   The regiment is a locally recruited British army unit whose
members are almost exclusively Protestant.
   No members of the provincial police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, were charged as a result of his inquiry, but two
officers were under investigation, he said.
   The findings was met by different reactions.
   It was denounced as a ``whitewash'' by Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army.
   Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Protestant hard-line
Democratic Unionist Party, dismissed the report as a ``cynical
political exercise brought out to appease nationalists.''
   Peter Brooke, the top British official in the province, told the
House of Commons he was convinced the regiment was fundamentally
sound but said the report ``has highlighted shortcomings and
deficiencies in several important areas.''
   Stevens was appointed in September by Royal Ulster Constabulary
Chief Constable Hugh Annesley.
   The inquiry followed the murder of a Roman Catholic, Loughlin
Maginn, by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an illegal Protestant
paramilitary group.
   When Maginn's relatives claimed he was not associated with any
terrorist group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters released police
documents that described him as a terrorist suspect.
   The Freedom Fighters' decision to publicize its possession of
intelligence documents drew attention to fears within the Roman
Catholic community that the security forces are not impartial. The
Ulster Defense Regiment, which is 97 percent Protestant, has been a
particular target of Catholic complaints of harassment and
brutality, and 16 Regiment men have been convicted of murder.
   The Ulster Defense Regiment is widely disliked by Northern
Ireland's Catholic minority, and the Irish government has called
for the unit to be disbanded. The British government and local
Protestant politicians have firmly defended the regiment.
   Stevens said the security forces had produced large quantities
of documents necessary for anti-terrorist operations.
   ``There has, however, been a serious lack of control and
adequate accounting procedures relating to the distribution of
these documents,'' Stevens said.
   In some cases, Stevens said, people were recruited by the Ulster
Defense Regiment against the recommendations of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   ``A small number of these went on to commit terrorist-related
and criminal offenses whilst serving with the regiment,'' he said.
   Many potential recruits came from strongly loyalist
neighborhoods and were subject to intense pressures, Stevens said.
   As members of the British army, Ulster Defense Regiment members
are targeted by the Irish Republican Army and other paramilitary
units opposed to British rule. Since 1970 when the unit was formed,
186 members have been killed.
   Stevens recommended forming a special anti-terrorist squad
within the Royal Ulster Constabulary, but Annesley disagreed. Such
a squad might work in Britain, where there were 23 terrorist
incidents last year, Annesley said, but not in Northern Ireland
were there were 1,655 incidents.
   Nearly 2,800 people have been killed in Northern Ireland since
sectarian violence began in August 1969. The violence has declined
in recent years.

   An Alabama senator called Thursday for a
Pentagon investigation into the resignation of a female U.S. Naval
Academy midshipman who was handcuffed to a men's room urinal and
taunted by male classmates.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, wrote Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy
Secretary Lawrence Garrett III asking them to personally
investigate the circumstances surrounding Gwen Marie Dreyer's
resignation.
   ``Those responsible for the sexual harassment were only given
demerits and a loss of leave time, while the victim has felt it
necessary to resign from the Navy,'' Shelby wrote.
   ``I have also been led to believe that the victim was
intimidated by classmates who warned her not to testify at a
disciplinary hearing,'' he said.
   The academy superintendent, Rear Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr., said
Wednedsay he had asked the chairman of the academy's board of
visitors to form a special subcommittee to report back this summer
with ``an honest appraisal and a good set of recommendations.''
   Hill said the panel would include Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
and three other members, and would work with a study group updating
a 1987 study on how well women have been assimilated into the
academy.
   Hill called the incident that led to Dreyer's resignation ``a
very, very isolated one.''
   ``Sexual harassment is something we try to deal with and try to
fix,'' he said.
   Shelby said he found the incident ``reprehensible'' and he urged
the Pentagon officials to ``make all efforts to determine whether
there is an institutional bias against women in our military
academies.''
   ``I hope that this is just an isolated incident, that it is not
reflective of a deep seated bias agaisnt women in our military,''
he said.
   Dreyer, of Encinitas, Calif., resigned from the Naval Academy
last month after she became dissatisfied with the investigation of
the Dec. 8 incident at the once all-male academy in Annapolis, Md.
   Midshipmen 2nd Class John Hindinger and Tom Rosson were punished
with demerits and loss of leave time as a result of the incident.
Six other midshipmen received written warnings for lesser roles in
the incident.
   The academy ruled that the incident wasn't premediated and
therefore could not be considered hazing, which can lead to
dismissal.
   Hill described the incident as ``a good-natured exchange'' that
``got out of hand.'' He said it escalated from a snowball fight
that had taken place minutes before.
   Dreyer was pulled from her dormitory room and dragged to the
bathroom by male midshipmen. She was eventually freed from the
urinal after her roommates shoved their way into the crowd and
pleaded for the keys to the handcuffs.
   About 10 percent of the 3,000 midshipmen at the academy are
women.
   A 1987 study of the assimilation of women into the academy since
they first were admitted in 1976 found that 35 percent of the women
who enrolled in the academy eventually left, compared with 22
percent of the men.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Asks China to Account for 650 Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Wednesday demanded China
account for the whereabouts of more than 650 prisoners arrested
since the June crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   The London-based human rights group said many prisoners were
reportedly beaten and tortured.
   ``One year after the killings in Beijing, the fate of those
prisoners is still veiled in official secrecy _ but they are not
forgotten,'' Amnesty said in a written statement. ``We know some of
their names and we want to know what has happened to them.''
   Amnesty has estimated at least 1,000 were killed and thousands
injured when troops moved in on peaceful demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square on June 3-4.
   The Chinese government has said nearly 300 people died during
the action, including armed forces members.
   Amnesty said it had sent a list of more than 650 names of
Chinese prisoners to Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng with a request
for information on what has happened to them.
   China has said 6,000 people were arrested following weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations, which were crushed by the military in
June. Amnesty International disputed that figure, saying a more
accurate number is in the tens of thousands.
   Amnesty said: ``The killings and arrests last year are just the
most recent, dramatic examples of sweeping and persistent
persecution in China. Our message to the government is that these
human rights violations are an international concern and that
international pressure will not go away.
   ``Workers arrested since the June crackdown in Beijing are
reported to have been particularly harshly treated by the martial
law authorities, and many are reported to have been subjected to
beatings and torture in detention during the weeks which followed
the crackdown,'' it said.
   Amnesty released brief biographies of 16 prisoners, including
religious leaders.
   The biographies also provided background on Tibetan monks and
nuns who were arrested for taking part in Tibetan independence
demonstrations in September.
   ``Sixteen nuns were among those arrested for participating in
peaceful marches with some of them sent to labor camps without
charge or trial and others imprisoned on counterrevolutionary
charges,'' Amnesty International said.
   Another biography focuses on Long Xianping, a 35-year-old
English teacher and mother of two boys, who was described to the
rights organization as a quiet, apolitical person. She was arrested
June 19, 1989, after making a political speech at a factory,
Amnesty said.
   Amnesty said Ms. Long was deeply disturbed when she heard of the
killings in Beijing. The political speech was her first. She was
sentenced to two years' imprisonment in mid-December on charges of
carrying out ``counterrevolutionary incitement,'' Amnesty said.

   Six firefighters were injured early Wednesday in
a fire at a midtown Manhattan hairdressing salon that caters to
high-society clients such as Jacqueline Onassis, officials said.
   The fire broke out at 4:50 a.m. at the four-story brownstone
building at 19 E. 54th St., which houses the Kenneth Beauty Salon
on its second floor, said John Mulligan, Fire Department spokesman.
   Three firefighters were taken to New York Hospital suffering
from smoke inhalation and other injuries, said Gail Richardson, a
spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Service.
   Three other firefighters were injured but refused medical
attention, she said.
   Thirty fire trucks and 100 men responded, and were still
battling the blaze at 7:15 a.m., Mulligan said.
   He said the salon is owned by Kenneth Battelle.

   The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President
Bush's nomination of Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins
Jr. to a seat on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board.
   Approval came on a voice vote without debate.
   Mullins, a former Harvard business school professor and one of
the designers of Bush's savings and loan bailout plan last year,
will fill the remaining six years of H. Robert Heller's term on the
board.
   In his confirmation hearing in March, Mullins, 43, pledged that
he would exercise his own judgment and would not blindly follow the
administration's bidding in its desire to see lower interest rates.
   He said at the time there was ``no compelling evidence'' that
the Fed's policies were unsound, and said he believed reports of a
rift between the administration and the Fed were exaggerated.

   A bill that would have passed if a
legislator's son hadn't cast a ``no'' vote while sitting at his
father's desk was defeated Wednesday when the House reconsidered it.
   State Rep. Mike Langton, a Democrat from Jacksonville, said his
12-year-old son Brian learned a valuable lesson.
   ``When you do something that you know you shouldn't, there are
consequences to that act,'' Langston said. ``I'm not embarrassed. I
think Brian was embarrassed.''
   The boy was working as a page May 4 when the bill sponsored by
Rep. Ron Glickman, D-Tampa, came up for a final vote. It would have
created a comprehensive list of children waiting for help from the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   Langton was out of the chamber making a telephone call during
the roll call. Sitting at his father's desk and faced with a choice
of punching the green ``yes'' button or the red ``no'' button,
Brian chose red.
   The result was a 53-53 tie, which defeated the bill.
   ``Once he did it, he suddenly had all these legislators hulking
over him saying, `Did your Dad tell you to do that?''' Langton said.
   When Langton returned to find out that his son had defeated the
bill, he told Glickman he would have voted ``yes,'' and Rep. Fred
Lippman, D-Hollywood, asked that the vote be reconsidered.
   On the House floor Wednesday, Langton joked that his son would
vote differently if given a second chance.
   ``Over the weekend I had the opportunity to confer with my son
Brian, and were it not for the pressures of his final exams in the
sixth grade he would be here today. And he wanted you to know that
he would vote in favor of Mr. Glickman's bill,'' Langton said.
   Despite Glickman's efforts to amend the bill and appease
lawmakers worried about its cost and effectiveness, it was defated
again, this time by a 60-52 count. Glickman said he held no grudge
against Brian.
   ``I don't consider that event as something that fundamentally
changed the course of history,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mandela to Commonwealth: Keep Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appealing for continued sanctions, Nelson
Mandela on Wednesday told foreign ministers of the British
Commonwealth that South Africa's white government is still allowing
police to murder blacks.
   ``We call upon you ... to impress upon your governments and
those other governments you could influence to halt and reverse the
efforts to untimely and wrongly lift sanctions,'' said Mandela,
deputy president of the African National Congress. The ANC is the
leading group fighting the apartheid system of racial separation in
South Africa.
   Mandela was addressing a ministerial committee on South Africa
of the 37-nation forum of Britain and its former colonies before
leaving Wednesday night for Algeria.
   ``Calls for the lifting of sanctions against the government of
South Africa are dangerous steps'' while blacks in the country
continue to be killed daily by police with the clear sanction of
the government, Mandela charged.
   ``Apartheid, the central problem that all of us are trying to
put an end to, remains untouched, in place and intact,'' he said.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk freed Mandela from prison
and announced a host of reforms in February. Mandela was in prison
for 27 years after he was convicted of plotting to sabotage the
government.
   De Klerk is holding talks with Mandela and other black leaders
to clear obstacles for full-scale negotiations on bringing blacks
into the political system.
   Mandela's appeal Wednesday was supported by Nigerian leader Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida, who told the meeting the world should not be
overly impressed with the ``tentative steps'' of de Klerk. De Klerk
is now on a European tour.
   In another development, a Nigerian military spokesman was quoted
Wednesday as saying civilians found guilty of helping to plot an
April 22 coup attempt will face firing squads along with rebel
soldiers.
   Lagos newspapers quoted Col. Fred Chijuka as saying a military
tribunal will begin trying those accused next week.
   About 200 soldiers and more than 130 civilians have been
detained for questioning in connection with the coup attempt. Last
week, the military government released 127 detained soldiers. An
unknown number of civilians have also been freed.
   No official casualty toll has been given from the fighting
during the coup attempt. Middle-ranking army officers mounted the
coup, saying they wanted to end Moslem domination of Nigerian
politics.

   A jury deciding the case of a white man accused
of killing a black teen-ager met in a closed courtroom Wednesday
with the trial judge as their deliberations crawled through a tenth
day.
   Meanwhile, a separate jury considering charges against a second
defendant, also charged with murder in the attack, was sequestered
for the night after one juror reported feeling ill.
   Both juries were to resume deliberations Thursday morning.
   The first panel, weighing charges against Joseph Fama, wanted a
private explanation of what constituted murder by depraved
indifference, and state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens
granted their request.
   Owens said the jurors asked for the closed-door session so they
could ``speak openly and ask questions.''
   When reporters objected, Owens replied, ``I'm not going to allow
you in here because they don't want it.''
   He then ordered the courtroom emptied.
   The jurors ``feel inhibited, they feel intimidated'' by the
media, Owens said. Fama, his lawyer, David DePetris, and
prosecutors were in the courtroom while the judge spoke with the
jurors privately.
   Owens later opened the courtroom and defined murder by depraved
indifference for the jury in the presence of reporters. ``If you
find that he had mental culpability and he solicits, requests or
aids others in the commission of this crime, he is guilty,'' he
said.
   Outside the courtroom DePetris said he felt Owens' instruction
was unfair. ``The judge gives the impression that very little is
needed to convict on depraved indifference,'' he said.
   Fama, 19, is charged with fatally shooting Yusuf Hawkins in the
predominantly white Bensonhurst neighborhood last Aug. 23.
Co-defendant Mondello was the alleged ringleader of the white gang
which attacked the black youth.
   The Mondello jury, which has twice sent out notes saying
deliberations were at a standstill, ended its ninth day of
discussions.
   Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, said outside the courtroom:
``I don't think the judge is going to force a verdict out of them.''
   Mondello, 19, was charged in a 16-count indictment in connection
with the Hawkins slaying. The major charges against Mondello are
murder and manslaughter.

<HEAD>Insurance Company Confused Man And Dog, Lawsuit Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has sued an insurance company claiming
it canceled his coverage after confusing his medical history with
that of his cocker spaniel.
   Michael J. Niderberg of Murrysville is seeking in excess of
$20,000 and a jury trial in Allegheny County court in a six-count
lawsuit filed last week.
   According to the lawsuit, New York Life Insurance Co. revoked
coverage because prescription drugs for the pet were listed in
Niderberg's name. The dog, Pepper, suffers from occasional
seizures, said Niderberg's attorney, Bruce Gelman.
   Niderberg's problems began after he had emergency surgery in
August 1988 for a bleeding ulcer. He was hospitalized again in
October 1988 for follow-up surgery.
   New York Life paid about $1,000 in medical bills before
canceling coverage and refusing to pay the balance, which came to
more than $50,000.
   The lawsuit claims New York Life's decision was based in part on
a mistaken belief Niderberg had a seizure disorder he had not
disclosed previously on the company's medical questionnaire.
   Gelman said his client told him the practice in Massachusetts,
where he lived when the medications were prescribed, was to issue
the drug in the name of the pet's owner.
   Attorney Daniel Lawson, who is representing New York Life,
declined to comment on the case because it was in litigation. David
Pomerantz, a spokesman for New York Life in New York, said company
policy barred him from commenting on the case.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces fought tank and
artillery battles for an eighth day Wednesday but then called a
cease-fire. Police said seven people were killed and 32 wounded.
   In south Lebanon, rival Shiite Moslem factions fought with
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns. Police said seven were
wounded in those battles between one group loyal to Syria and
another allied with Iran.
   The casualties from the Christian fighting in and around east
Beirut raised the overall toll to 1,029 dead and 2,762 injured
since that showdown began Jan. 30. Troops of rebel Gen. Michel Aoun
are fighting Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen.
   The thuds of exploding shells reverberated across Christian east
Beirut from nightfall Tuesday to past sundown Wednesday. Thousands
of residents were trapped in underground shelters.
   The cease-fire, brokered by the Maronite Catholic church, was
called at 9 p.m. in east Beirut and surrounding Christian
communities, radio stations of both warring factions reported.
Scores of previous truces have collapsed.
   Police said the shelling duels dwindled shortly after the
cease-fire proclamation but that intense sniping persisted.
   The conflict, the worst confrontation between Christians in the
nation's 15-year-old civil war, has forced more than 400,000 of the
Christian enclave's 1 million people to flee.
   Aoun on Wednesday was quoted by the conservative Ad-Diyar
newspaper as denying an earlier report he had offered to step aside
if the Maronite Catholic synod of archbishops under Patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir asked him to.
   ``I am staying at Baabda to welcome Geagea's fighters here,''
Aoun told Ad-Diyar in an interview, referring to the presidential
palace where he has his headquarters.
   Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the community that has
dominated the political system since Lebanon's independence from
France in 1943.
   In south Lebanon, morning clashes pitted the pro-Iranian Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, against the
Syrian-backed secular Amal militia.
   Their battles shattered a 6-day-old truce in Iqlim al-Tuffah
province.
   Since May 1987, the two factions have been struggling for
leadership of the country's 1 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
sect. The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 1,041
killed and 3,081 wounded.

   Two daughters of a former child-abuse expert won a
multimillion-dollar award against their father on Wednesday for
what they said was years of physical and sexual abuse.
   Sharon Simone, 45, of Boston, and her sister Susan Hammond, 44,
of southern California, sued their 72-year-old father, Edward J.
Rodgers, a former FBI agent and chief investigator for the El Paso
County District Attorney's office, which employed him as a
child-abuse expert.
   The sisters sought unspecified damages from their father for
repeated physical and sexual abuse allegedly inflicted by Rodgers
between 1944 and 1965.
   Neither Rodgers nor his attorney was present during the trial,
and the proceedings were conducted by the sisters' female lawyers
before an all-female jury hand-picked by the attorneys.
   Rodgers recently fired his attorney, Thomas D. Gresham, who said
this week that he has been unable to locate his client.
   The jury began deliberations on Wednesday and returned after
only a few hours with an award of $1.2 million for each sister. It
awarded $600,000 to each sister for economic and non-economic
damages and $600,000 for punitive damages; Colorado law does not
allow punitive damages to exceed other damages.
   Hammond and Simone expressed remorse and regret at a news
conference after the trial that Rodgers had not come forward to
take responsibility for his actions and to hear the graphic
testimony in the case.
   ``(The trial) was about truth and justice, and for me,
compensation,'' said Hammond. ``I was angry at the thought of my
father dying and meeting his God and getting justice that way. I
wanted some justice in this world, and if it comes in the form of
money, that's how I'll take it.''
   The sisters said they didn't know if they would ever collect the
award.
   Simone and Hammond, as well as their sisters Elizabeth
``Beanie'' Medlicott and Mary LaRocque, testified during two days
of testimony about the physical, emotional and sexual trauma
inflicted by Rodgers as they were growing up in Denver and Colorado
Springs.
   Medlicott and LaRocque were not plaintiffs in the trial, but
testified on behalf of their sisters.
   Edward Rodgers defended himself against the allegations in a
deposition. He admitted that he hit his wife and may have hit his
children, but didn't remember doing so. He described himself as a
perfectionist who had fought alcoholism for years.
   ``I have thought of myself for years as a domineering son of a
bitch who demanded strict obedience from my children,'' he said.
``I know that I have a terrible temper. I'm sure that I was harsh
with them, but I don't know that it rose to the level of criminal
abuse.''
   The sisters have all undergone extensive counseling and
psychiatric treatment, and Simone and Hammond say they are unable
to have intimate sexual relationships.

   A man seeking justice for the 1984 murder of his
wife is suing Cuban President Fidel Castro because the killer was a
Mariel refugee.
   Leonardo Rodriguez, now 38, was convicted of killing Jean Ludwig
as she jogged along a Key Largo bike path.
   ``At the time Fidel Castro and Cuba forced Rodriguez into the
United States, both of them knew Rodriguez was a rapist and a
murderer whom they had confined to prison in Cuba for those
offenses,'' Gerald Ludwig's lawsuit says.
   In 1980, Rodriguez was among 125,000 Mariel refugees who crossed
the Florida Straits, named for the port from which they left in a
Castro-authorized exodus.
   ``Castro didn't know who the victim would be, but he knew the
consequences of releasing violent criminals into the streets of
Florida,'' James Lynch, Ludwig's attorney, said Tuesday.
   ``It's an outrageous act by a foreign government that had a
direct impact on us,'' Lynch said, adding that Ludwig, a fisheries
biologist who now lives in Louisiana, ``doesn't want it happening
to anyone else.''
   Lynch first filed the wrongful death suit in 1988, but a Dade
Circuit judge dismissed the case because Castro had not been served
with court papers within the 90-day limit set by the Supreme Court.
   Lynch refiled the suit in October. Late last month, another
Circuit judge gave him 60 days to serve papers on Castro and his
government.
   There is no indication yet that the papers have been received in
Havana.

   The academy bestowed $500,000 in awards, fellowships and
scholarships on the winners at an annual ceremony at its Harlem
headquarters.
   Doctorow won the Howells Medal, given once every five years for
the best work of American fiction, for ``Billy Bathgate.''
   The Medal for Spoken Language was given to Keillor, whose new
radio series, ``American Radio Company of the Air,'' follows his
successful ``A Prairie Home Companion'' series.
   The academy's gold medals for history and architecture, bestowed
once every six years, went to historian C. Vann Woodward and

   The institute and the academy were chartered separately by acts
of Congress in 1913 and 1916, respectively. They merged in 1976.
   The ceremony also included the induction of five new members
into the academy by novelist John Updike, chancellor of the
academy. They are painter Helen Frankenthaler, novelist William
Gaddis, novelist and literary critic Elizabeth Hardwick, literary

   The Soviet Union has suspended its withdrawal
of troops from East Germany, officials of both Germanys said
Wednesday.
   The Soviets gave no official explanation of their decision. A
West German official said they were struggling with logistical
problems, but an East German minister claimed the Soviets had
political motivations.
   West German Defense Ministry spokesman Capt. Stefan Lang told
The Associated Press the Soviets were having troubling reabsorbing
troops pulled out of Eastern Europe. ``We don't see political
motivations,'' he said.
   There has been widespread speculation housing shortages and
economic troubles in the Soviet Union will create problems for
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to bring tens of
thousands of soldiers home.
   But East Germany's defense minister, Rainer Eppelmann, said the
Soviets made their latest decision because they fear the
withdrawals from his country, Hungary and Czechoslovakia could
leave NATO with a military advantage in Europe.
   In his interview with Deutschlandfunk radio, Eppelmann said the
overall Soviet reductions would lead to a ``superiority of the
West'' in military strength.
   In December 1988, Gorbachev promised a unilateral withdrawal
from East Germany. According to Lang, the number was to be about
36,000 troops, nearly one-tenth the Soviet force estimated to be
there.
   More than 10,000 Soviet troops are believed to have already
returned home from East Germany, the West German spokesman said.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working out plans to reduce the
number of their troops to 195,000 each in central Europe.

   About 3 million used tires burned out
of control Wednesday night at Quebec's largest tire dump, 12 miles
east of Montreal.
   Work crews with bulldozers worked frantically to stop the fire
from spreading to a nearby forest and trenches were dug to separate
the 4-story-high mounds of tires.
   Residents of nearby St. Amable, a town of 5,000, were told there
was no need to evacuate.
   Cause of the fire was unknown.
   On Feb. 12, a fire fed by 14 million tires burned for 17 days in
Ontario, spewing toxic smoke into the air and forcing the
evacuation of 600 people from their homes.
   Five teen-agers were arrested and charged with setting the fire
at Tyre King Recycling in Hagersville, 12 miles north of Lake Erie
and 60 miles north of Erie, Ohio.

   The overwhelming Senate vote for a nearly $3
billion bill to help states and cities cope with AIDS expenses will
encourage President Bush to find room for the spending in the
federal budget, a key Republican backer says.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he believe White House officials
will drop any reservations about the bill's cost when they hold
budget deliberations with congressional leaders, in part because of
the breadth of the Senate's 95-4 vote Wednesday.
   ``I think basically they wanted to see how the bill would
ultimately sift out. They now know, at least from the Senate
standpoint,'' Hatch said.
   ``We're very hopeful ... that the White House will see the

And I have no doubt that they will,'' he said.

   Under the settlement signed Wednesday night, public employees'
salaries are doubled and the government promises not to fire those

   Some workers remained in government buildings but were to

   The agreement was a victory for the Sandinista unions, which

   Hollywood's stars shed tears for Sammy Davis
Jr., the exuberant song-and-dance man who started as a goggle-eyed
child vaudevillian and battled to the glittery top of the

   The man who joked he was the nation's only ``black, one-eyed,

hospital March 13 after a two-month stay.

   Teen-age customers of some record store chains
now need more than money to buy certain hot LPs. They need ID.
   Bowing to pressure from politicians and parents over what they
consider objectionable lyrics, some stores have begun to card
youngsters.
   In some places, no one under 18 can buy products by rap and
heavy metal acts that carry a warning label affixed by record
companies.
   ``This stuff is addictive,'' says state Sen. Jean Dixon, a fan
of Christian music whose attempt to force record companies to label
albums with explicit material failed in committee. ``I had a kid
write and tell me he's addicted to this bad music.''

<HEAD>Mendes Murder Trial Test of Justice in Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Brazilians see the trial of
three ranchers accused of killing Chico Mendes, a champion of
rubber tappers and the rain forest, as a test of justice in a
nation traditionally ruled by money.
   It is to begin next month, on a date not yet determined, in a
tiny courtroom in the Amazon jungle town of Xapuri, where Mendes
was shot down outside his home Dec. 11, 1988.
   At issue, in addition to the facts of the case, are a disregard
for law that has penetrated all levels of Brazilian society, and
the general belief that the rich and powerful can bribe their way
out of anything.
   ``Morality in Brazil has hit such a low that ethical conduct is
no longer regarded as practical,'' Rio sociologist Helio Jaguaribe
said in an interview.
   Money always has been valued above the law in this nation of 150
million, which is suffering its worst economic crisis, but the
Mendes case has highlighted what Brazilians call the ``impunity''
of the rich. It also has inspired demands for moral and judicial
reform.
   Mendes, who was 44 when he died, led a rubber tappers' union and
fought to save the Amazon from deforestation. He was killed despite
warnings to Brazil's top justice officials that named his potential
assassins.
   Internationally, he became a martyr to environmentalism. In
Brazil, he is revered more as a man who died protecting the rights
of peasants against powerful ranchers, who often hire gunmen to do
their bidding in the jungle.
   The national and international outcry produced an initial flurry
of activity. Police arrested a cattle rancher and his two sons a
month after the killing and promised repeatedly that justice would
be done.
   Judicial squabbling and red tape have put the trial on hold for
17 months, however, and the three suspects nearly escaped from the
lightly guarded Acre state penitentiary in January.
   Because of the delay, some have begun to wonder whether the
trial will occur. Amnesty International says only two of 1,000
killings linked to land conflicts between Brazilian peasants and
landowners have gone to trial since 1980.
   Several assassination attempts were made last year on Julio
Barbosa, who succeeded Mendes as leader of the Xapuri rubber
tappers.
   Corruption took root under the military regimes of 1964-1985 and
blossomed after five years of ineffectual government under civilian
President Jose Sarney, who was replaced in March by Fernando Collor
de Mello.
   During Sarney's term, nearly all the federal budget was spent on
financing a bloated government.
   Fraud in financing a multimillion-dollar railroad project and a
graft scandal involving a former planning minister went unpunished.
Newspapers regularly carried reports of legislators paying for
extravagant trips with public money.
   ``People have read so much about the dirty deals of corrupt
congressmen and state officials that they think anything goes,''
said Radley Vigio, a Rio police officer.
   On New Year's Eve 1988, the tourist boat Bateau Mouche IV, built
to carry 50, was jammed with 150 revelers and sank in front of
Sugar Loaf Mountain, killing 54 people. Naval police had stopped
the boat, but let it go, and there were accusations a bribe was
paid.
   Last October, a clandestine landfill created by a private
construction company collapsed on the Nova Republica slum in Sao
Paulo. At least 14 people were known dead and about 75 were never
found.
   No one has been arrested in either case.
   ``These inhuman things happen because the guilty often slip
through the fingers of the justice system,'' said Lt. Eide
Trindade, director of Rio's task force on organized crime.
   An outdated legal code, labyrinthine bureacracy and lack of
resources discourage police, which prompts people to take the law
into their own hands.
   A mob of 1,000 people raided a jail in the northeastern town of
Santa Maria da Vitoria last year and lynched two men suspected of
killing a 19-year-old woman.
   Violence continues in the Amazon. Leftist union leader Expeditor
Ribeiro de Souza and two of his three sons were killed recently in
the northern Amazon state of Para, despite warnings to the police
that ranchers had hired gunmen to kill them.

<HEAD>Moldavians Strive for Union Despite Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IASI, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moldavians are moving closer together
despite the frontier Josef Stalin erected between them in 1940 when
he seized Bessarabia from Romania and made it Soviet Moldavia.
   Early in April, Romanian peasants in the border area dismantled
the wire fence on their side of the Prut River border and urged
Soviet Moldavians do to the same.
   On Sunday, May 6, Soviet Moldavia opened the border for six
hours so Romanians could cross and visit their ethnic brethren.
Tens of thousands did so.
   Soviet citizens were not allowed to visit Romania, but some
sneaked in.
   People on both sides call the area a cradle of Romanian culture.
   For centuries, Iasi was a center of Romanian learning and
capital of a ``greater Moldavia'' that included Bessarabia and
northern Bukovina, also annexed by Moscow in 1940 and now in the
Ukraine. The city of 500,000, Romania's second-largest, is only 6
miles from the border.
   Despite the calls for reunion, some inhabitants do not appear
eager to make Iasi the center of a newly reunified ``greater
Moldavia.''
   ``It's not exactly the right time,'' said Alexandru Pascu, a
senior reporter with the cultural weekly Cronica. ``We should see
first what happens with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, then ask
that Bessarabia be returned to Romania.''
   ``If we do it now, Gorbachev won't accept the breakup of his
empire and will probably use force to prevent it.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev imposed economic sanctions on
Lithuania after it proclaimed independence from the Soviet Union.
Latvia and Estonia also have declared their intention to become
independent, but have proceeded more cautiously.
   Stalin annexed all three Baltic republics, as he did Bessarabia
and northern Bukovina, under a secret protocol of his 1939
non-agression pact with Hitler.
   Romulus Neagu, deputy foreign minister of Romania, told
reporters in Bucharest: ``Romania has no territorial claims, but as
a general principle, one should observe the right of every nation
to self-determination.''
   With political union a distant goal, Moldavia's new culture
minister, Ion Ungureanu, has urged creation of a ``cultural
confederation.''
   In an interview with the Romanian newpaper Adevarul in March, he
said that would allow Moldavians and Soviet Moldavians to receive
each other's television programs.
   About 300 prominent authors, journalists and Orthodox priests
from Bucharest and Kishinev, capital of Soviet Moldavia, met in
Bucharest on March 27 and demanded that Soviet Moldavia, or
Bessarabia, be allowed to rejoin Romania.
   The meeting was organized for the 72nd anniversary of the union
of the province with Romania in 1918, after World War I.
   Gheorghe Ghimpu, head of the Moldavian People's Front of Soviet
Moldavia, declared at the conference: ``The tragedy of Moldavians
started with the Hitler-Stalin pact, when unjust frontiers were
imposed.''
   Nicolae Stoicescu, religious affairs minister of Romania,
appealed for ``the strengthening of cultural and spiritual unity''
between Romania and Soviet Moldavia as a ``first step toward
political union.''
   Other speakers demanded the ``amputated'' territory be returned
to Romania.
   Yevgeny Tyazhelnikov, then Soviet ambassador to Romania,
acknowledged late in March that ``there are tendencies aiming at
the greater independence'' of Moldavia, but ruled out returning
Bessarabia to Romania.
   Stoicescu met with Moldavians who advocate increased cultural
cooperation, including deliveries of religious books in Romanian to
the Soviet side of the border.
   Soviet Moldavians requested Romanian assistance and experts for
restoration of churches in the republic.
   Millions of Romanians and Moldavians now can receive Sunday
broadcasts of Orthodox Mass by Radio Iasi, which resumed operation
after communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed and executed
in December.
   Ceausescu closed the station in 1985. It now broadcasts
religious, historical and other news to ethnic Moldavians, who make
up 70 percent of Soviet Moldavia's population.
   Revival of the radio station and growing border contacts are
among the strongest indications to date of Romania's desire for
some control over Soviet Moldavia.
   Soviet Moldavians began pressing for greater autonomy two years
ago.
   In September, Soviet officials agreed to replace the Cyrillic
alphabet imposed by Stalin with the Latin alphabet Romanians use.

<HEAD>Fernandez Takes on Corrupt School Boards and Messy Desks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools are crumbling, the administration is
rife with bunglers, kids are failing tests and dropping out at a
colossal rate _ and Board of Education bureaucrats are writing
memos, telling teachers how to wash their hands.
   ``Apply soap, lather well,'' advised step No. 3.
   This is what Joseph A. Fernandez found when he arrived five
months ago at 110 Livingston St., headquarters of the nation's
largest school system. But since he took office as schools
chancellor, Fernandez has shaken the system of its lethargy; he
envisions a lean, mean education machine.
   ``I'm sure some people view me as the outsider, coming in and
stirring this whole system up,'' Fernandez said.
   ``The bottom line on this is how does it impact kids,'' he said.
``I'm not concerned with how it impacts everybody else.''
   Fernandez moved quickly to strengthen his authority. He
dismissed several local school officials and took over the board
governing one of the system's 32 local districts.
   The staff of 5,200 at 110 Livingston was cut by 400. By
Fernandez' edict, top aides must be in the office by 7:30 a.m. And
while there, they and the rest of the staff must follow rules on
such things as office neatness, how to dress and proper telephone
etiquette.
   ``He wants things done and he wants them done properly,'' said
his spokesman, James Vlasto. ``Probably for the veterans here, it's
taken them somewhat aback.''
   The number of teachers and students in the system, almost 1.1
million combined, is larger than the population of Dallas, the
nation's seventh-largest city. And its $7 billion budget is bigger
than that of 15 states.
   The problems are just as big. More than 35 percent of the
950,000 students read below minimum standards. There is a backlog
of 33,000 repair requests for the system's 1,000 buildings. In the
1988-89 school year, 1,854 weapons were confiscated from students
and 9,000 reports of violence were recorded.
   Fernandez, a 53-year-old native New Yorker who spent his entire
career outside the city, seems unfazed. Sitting behind a massive
oak desk, classical music playing softly in the background, he
gives the impression of a man firmly in control.
   Practicing what he preaches, everything on the desk _ and
there's not much _ is piled neatly. A computer terminal sits to one
side; he is the first schools chancellor to ask for one.
   He admits he has stepped on a few toes with his direct style,
and angered some local school board members who feel he is
overstepping his authority under the 20-year-old state law that
decentralized the city schools.
   Some examples:
   _He appointed trustees to take over a long-troubled Brooklyn
school district where auditors found $2 million was misspent and
children were deprived of remedial reading, drug education and
other services.
   _He ordered the suspension or removal of two district school
superintendents and three principals.
   _He overturned a local school board's selection of a
superintendent, issuing new rules in the process setting minimum
standards for the job. Another school board was ordered to fire an
untenured principal.
   _He is seeking to have each of the city's 1,000 schools publish
an annual budget for public scrutiny.
   Fernandez' entire educational career had been in Florida, where
he started as a math teacher in 1962. Within 10 years, he became
Miami's first Hispanic principal and was named superintendent of
schools there in 1987.
   He already has managed feats in New York that his predecessors
were unable to accomplish.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed an act giving him the power to transfer
principals, who had been granted ``building tenure'' by law. The
bill passed after Fernandez hammered out a deal with the
principals' union.
   He also has support in Albany, the state capital, to eliminate
the city Board of Examiners, a teacher licensing board that critics
say duplicates the state licensing apparatus and discourages
teachers from working in New York City.
   But Fernandez' biggest innovation is one that he pioneered as
head of schools in Miami _ one that, if successful, could free
schools from such Board of Education dictates as last year's
seven-step hand-washing memo.
   The plan, called school-based management and shared
decision-making, would allow teachers, parents and principals to
identify problems in their own schools _ problems like reading
levels, poor attendance or drugs _ and develop solutions.
   Fernandez said he expects about 200 schools to participate in
the first year. Officials at each school will receive $20,000 to
use as they see fit _ for training or to hire consultants, for
example.
   ``It's their plan, their strategy, their dollars,'' he said.
``As you get ownership, my experience has been people try a little
bit harder to make the thing work.''
   The chancellor's office will provide technical assistance and
check progress toward the goals, ``having the ability to step in
when the thing's not working right and fixing it,'' Fernandez said.
   ``There's a lot of people, not just here in the city watching,
but nationally,'' he said. ``If it plays in New York, it can play
anywhere.''
   Fernandez has more innovations in mind. He is talking about
increasing the high-school math requirement their plans.
   ``The association will never stop trying to broadcast,'' Nick
said. ``Never, never, never.''
   The ship is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square in Beijing in May 1989. It was destroyed during
the June 4 military crackdown that left hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of civilians dead.
   Exiled Chinese dissident leaders have expressed support for the
project but none were expected to be on board for the broadcasts
because of threats from Beijing that it would arrest Chinese aboard.
   The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to Communist forces in mainland China. While the two
sides remain technically at war, indirect trade and civilian
contacts have increased in recent years.

<TEXT>
   Early in the show, a couple drunkenly staggers
into their motel room at night. At dawn, she gets mad when he
suggests in crude terms it'd be no good for either of them if
others knew of their affair.
   ``Ah, what I mean is, we function professionally first,'' he
says, trying to mollify her. He worsens matters by saying they need
to ``keep an official distance.''
   This tends to undermine ``By Dawn's Early Light,'' an HBO movie
premiering Saturday that concerns the prospect of doom thanks to
Soviet military dissidents trying to provoke nuclear war with the
United States.
   You see, the man in the motel (Powers Boothe) is an Air Force
major, a B-52 bomber pilot. The woman (Rebecca De Mornay) is his
co-pilot.
   It just does not do for B-52 bomber pilots to have love affairs.
Sure as heck, they'll have a tiff at an awkward moment _ like while
en route to a Soviet target.
   Suppose she sees one of the plane's bombs go off? Suppose she
realizes the end of humanity is likely and refuses orders to drop
another Big One?
   Well, she might be considered sane. But her beau might pull
rank, give her a bottle of cyanide pills and say, ``You are
relieved, captain. Get the hell out of here.'' And then relent, and
gently plead, ``Don't leave me now.''
   Alas, these things happen. And they sandbag what might otherwise
be an interesting film about how the end of the Cold War doesn't
necessarily mean the possibility of nuclear war is gone, too.
   Written by Bruce Gilbert, the film's trip to the edge of
Armageddon begins when Soviet dissidents launch a nuclear missile
against one of their own cities.
   This triggers an automatic nuclear attack on U.S. military bases
and Andrews Air Force base near Washington, then the start of the
U.S. counterattack, of which Boothe's five-member B-52 crew is part.
   The Soviet president, learning the truth of the first strike on
his nation, desperately tries to turn off the war, pleading with
his American counterpart (Martin Landau) to do likewise.
   The American wants to believe him and orders only an attack
similar in scope to that of the Soviets, despite recommendations of
massive retaliation.
   But the war escalates because of an error; U.S. computers don't
initially realize a second Soviet launch is directed at China, not
the United States.
   The crisis worsens when the U.S. president is thought killed in
a nuclear blast. His immediate successors all are dead, and
leadership of the nation passes to the Secretary of the Interior
(Darren McGavin).
   In a welcome switch for this kind of movie, not all top U.S.
military officers are portrayed as bomb-crazed, kill-the-commies
lunatics.
   In fact, two senior officers _ James Earl Jones as the general
commanding an airborne command post and Jeffrey De Munn as the new
president's military adviser _ are the ones who repeatedly urge
restraint.
   But it's to no avail, since the new, inexperienced president
succumbs to the let's-go-boom blandishments of an Army colonel (Rip
Torn).
   If that's not bad enough, one of Boothe's crew members, in
anguish over the deaths of his family in the Soviet attack, goes
mad. That has a terrible impact on most of the crew in his B-52.
   But the movie's in-flight attempt to heighten the drama just
doesn't work. The film would have been far better without a B-52
crew lurking in it.
   For starters, this crew's cockpit discipline is plumb awful. And
it's very hard to believe that not only is a woman flying the
bomber (women in the U.S. military still are barred from combat
slots), but that she and the command pilot are bunkmates.
   Boothe, as a flier of the good-old-boy school, turns in a
masterful performance, despite dialogue so clunky it constitutes a
lethal weapon. And the larger issues of doom raised by the movie do
get one to thinking.
   But by shoehorning in amour and turning its B-52 into the Love
Bomber, ``By Dawn's Early Light'' proves a lot more dim than it
should have been.

   New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
presidential primary was beginning to rev up at this time four
years ago. This time around, it's stuck in the garage.
   Presidential hopefuls including Democrats Richard Gephardt and
Bruce Babbitt were campaigning actively in the state in May 1986.
Republican George Bush and other candidates had campaign people at
work there.
   This year, no potential candidates have visited in the past six
months and no campaign people are soliciting support for would-be
presidents.
   Democratic political activists in the state aren't lamenting the
lack of attention.
   ``A long campaign focuses attention much too early and it takes
away from things we need to be doing at the state and local
levels,'' said state House Minority Leader Mary Chambers, who ran
Michael Dukakis' 1988 campaign in New Hampshire.
   ``I don't believe the first-in-the-nation primary is beneficial
for the state,'' said Dennis Murphy, who ran Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon's 1988 presidential campaign in the state. ``It takes away
from state politics.''
   In the 1988 race, Gephardt campaigned for more than two years in
Iowa and New Hampshire. The Missouri congressman won the Iowa
caucus and finished second to Dukakis in New Hampshire, but ended
up withdrawing before the national convention.
   Jean Wallin, co-chair of Gephardt's 1988 New Hampshire campaign,
said ``there isn't any reason for them to be here now. You can
accomplish as much in one year as in two, and you won't be burned
out at election time.''
   Murphy agreed.
   ``The joke in New Hampshire in 1980 was people would be asked,
`Are you going to vote for Ronald Reagan?' and they would answer,
`I don't know. I've only met him twice,''' he said. ``I don't think
it's necessary for each person to meet a candidate four times
before making a decision.''
   With Reagan's retirement on the horizon, candidates and workers
from both parties began descending on New Hampshire two years
before the 1988 primary. This time, President Bush is expected to
seek another term and Republican candidates are non-existent.
   Several prominent Democrats have visited the state, including
Gephardt, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste and Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder, but none recently.
   Ned Helms, New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman, said many
top Democrats have turned down invitations to speak in New
Hampshire because they fear a visit would be misconstrued. Those
who have stayed away include Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, he said.
   ``People are reluctant to come to New Hampshire because the
minute they get here people say, `Aha, you're running,''' Helms
said.
   Other possible factors keeping Democrats from jumping into the
campaign are Bush's high approval rating and the thrashing Dukakis
took in 1988, activists said.
   ``I guess the Democrats may be thinking that Bush is a
shoo-in,'' Wallin said. ``I certainly hope that's not the case.''
   State GOP chairwoman Rhona Charbonneau and others said
Massachusetts' swift economic decline, which began while Dukakis
was campaigning for the presidency, has made candidates wary of
starting too early.
   Many potential Democratic candidates also are concerned with
re-election and don't want to risk leaving their states to start a
presidential campaign, activists said.
   So when might candidates begin arriving in New Hampshire? Most
political observers predict the stream of potential presidents will
begin sometime after the November elections and most likely early
next year.
   ``People should check their Christmas cards so they'll know
who's going to be here in January,'' Wallin said.

   Iowa's perpetual campaign machinery is
running short on one key component _ presidential candidates.
   ``It's a national question: Who are the candidates?'' said
Democratic activist John Cacciatore.
   The 1990 midterm elections still are months away but thoughts
already are turning toward the 1992 race for the White House. In
Iowa, whose precinct caucuses are the nation's first test of
presidential strength, things have been quiet but few are surprised.
   Not that there haven't been any visitors. The day after the 1988
election, Jesse Jackson courted farm activists in Des Moines, and
he returned the following year.
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen keynoted a Democratic Party fund-raiser
last fall, and lectured activists on the lessons to be learned from
the party's latest loss.
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley raised some money for local
candidates, and Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye even joked about
accepting the party's nomination during an event this year.
Colorado Rep. Pat Schroeder has given a couple of policy speeches.
   All in all, activists say, things are about on track.
   ``At this point in the last cycle, you would have not seen
anybody a lot,'' said Barry Piatt, who worked for Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign. Gephardt won the
Iowa caucus but withdrew before the national convention.
   This year the story is a Democratic one, since President Bush is
expected to seek a second term. There's been intense speculation
about who the Democrats will field, and some have worried that none
are making early moves.
   Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Joe Shannahan rejected those
concerns, and pointed to campaign records from previous election
cycles.
   The first candidate to put staffers in the field the last time
around was former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who dispatched two
aides to work for local candidates in the summer of 1986, he said.
   In the 1984 election cycle, records show only token campaign
appearances by this point. Florida Gov. Reubin Askew made one
appearance in the spring of 1982, as did California Sen. Alan
Cranston. Colorado Sen. Gary Hart made a single foray in May 1982,
while Ohio Sen. John Glenn didn't visit Iowa until June of that
year.
   Only the eventual 1984 Democratic nominee, Walter F. Mondale,
had made multiple appearances by this point, the records show.
   Further, Shannahan said, the last election cycle was an
intensely active one because there was no incumbent on the ballot.
   U.S. Rep. David Nagle, a former state Democratic chairman, said
the timing of this year's campaign is logical.
   Bentsen, he said, generated wide name identification when he ran
on the 1988 ticket with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and
would benefit by the shortest possible campaign.
   Others have what's known as the ``1990 problem.''
   ``The reason you don't have presidential candidates in Iowa this
year is because the potential presidential candidates are running
for re-election in their home states,'' Nagle said.
   Bradley, Gephardt, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon and Ms. Schroeder all are on
the ballot this year, he noted.
   While many see the early presidential contests as an endurance
contest, that's not always the case.
   Dukakis won his party's nomination, and finished a respectable
third in Iowa. His first campaign appearance in the state came in
January 1987, roughly a year before the precinct caucuses.
   ``You can come reasonably late to Iowa and still get a fair
shake,'' Nagle said.

   Former Gov. Lester Maddox, whose name
became synonymous with Southern segregationist defiance in the
1960s, is back campaigning for his old job and outrageously
outspoken as ever.
   But he says good government _ not race _ is his issue now.
   Let there be no mistake: Maddox, who closed his Pickrick fried
chicken restaurant in Atlanta in the '60s rather than serve blacks,
still disapproves of desegregation.
   ``As well as a constitutional human right to associate with
whomever you please, there should be a corresponding right to
disassociate if you please,'' he said recently.
   But he prefers to colorfully expound on his contention that he's
the only hope of freeing Georgia from the grip of wasteful
political insiders.
   ``I want to be your Ex Lax in state government,'' was a frequent
quip one warm spring day as he pounded the sidewalks and shopping
centers in the southern suburbs of Atlanta, popping in on
unsuspecting merchants and their customers and, momentarily, taking
center stage.
   Spry at age 74 despite a bout with cancer, Maddox is one of five
candidates seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the
state's July 17 primary.
   A 16-year absence from state office has taken its toll. A recent
newspaper poll showed Maddox in last place in the five-man
Democratic field with 3 percent. Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
led with 29 percent in his bid to become the nation's second black
elected governor and Georgia's first.
   Maddox sees it differently: ``Either me or Andy Young is going
to be the next governor.''
   A public school dropout who later took a correspondence course
and opened a restaurant, Maddox became Georgia's governor in 1967
because of a fluke in state law.
   Nationally known for opposing integration, including an incident
in which customers at his restaurant armed themselves with pick
handles, Maddox won the Democratic nomination in 1966 but got fewer
votes in the general election than Republican Howard ``Bo''
Callaway.
   Write-in votes for other candidates kept Callaway from receiving
a majority. The election thus was thrown to the heavily Democratic
Legislature, which chose Maddox.
   Despite his advance billing, Maddox said in his inaugural
address he would not tolerate extremism in Georgia, and he
proceeded to appoint more blacks to state office than any of his
predecessors.
   Maddox also initiated a twice-monthly affair called ``Little
People's Day,'' opening the doors of his office to anyone with a
problem.
   The law at that time did not allow governors to seek consecutive
terms, so at the end of four years, Maddox ran for and won the
office of lieutenant governor, ousting the incumbent.
   But his popularity waned as he and Jimmy Carter, who succeeded
him as governor, wrangled bitterly for four years, and Maddox lost
a bid in 1974 to regain the governorship.
   Sixteen years later, time seems to have done little to dull his
exuberant personality, sense of timing or love of one-liners.
   A hearty handshake that pulls the other party off-balance long
has been a Maddox trademark. It still was in force as he grabbed
hands in the Clayton County Courthouse in suburban Jonesboro, often
with a ``How you, friend?''
   Jurors, deputies, clerks, lawyers searching deed titles _ all
were fair game as he moved through the building like a typhoon.
   Several asked ``Old Lester'' how he was doing. A typical reply:
``I'm praying and loving and living, and if you aren't doing the
first two, you aren't doing much of the third.''
   Some asked if he brought his bicycle, referring to his gimmick
of riding a bicycle backwards.
   Not this time, he told them.
   The campaigning this day was in friendly territory, places that
16 years ago likely would have sported campaign signs proclaiming,
``This is Maddox Country.''
   Many remembered Maddox, including Guy Roundtree of Riverdale.
``He's a fine man,'' Roundtree said. ``I voted for him when he was
governor.''
   But there were a lot of blank stares, too. With 3.6 million of
Georgia's estimated 6.4 million residents under the age of 34, that
means 56 percent of the population wasn't even of voting age when
Maddox left office.
   But he insisted he has a chance.
   ``The people seem to be more unhappy, more dissatisfied now .. .
than I have ever imagined or experienced. They feel like they're
being left out, and there's nobody fighting for them. I think
that's one of the strong things going for my candidacy,'' he said.
   Maddox contended he is the only candidate with government
experience ``who knows what to do with dollars _ how to spend 'em
and how to use 'em _ and how to speak on behalf of outsiders. ...
There's no candidate likely to be elected governor, other than
myself, who isn't a captive of the political establishment.''

<HEAD>How One U.S. Industry Declined</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's industry uses more gears than
foreign competitors and in 1984 it manufactured more of them, too.
But a 170-page study by the U.S. International Trade Commission
tells how this country turned into a major importer of gears.
   In the period 1984-1988, imports increased more than 57 percent.
Imports from Japan, the biggest supplier, more than doubled.
   The report tells of layoffs, plant closings, low spending on
research, on development and on new machinery. U.S. gear-makers
increased earnings nearly twice as fast as sales, but by the time
they got done paying for the plant closings, high interest rates
and assets that lost their value, the rise was only 11 percent.
   There were a lot of mergers, buyouts and joint ventures _ many
of them by non-American companies. A few American producers bought
interests in other countries.
   By 1988, U.S. concerns could produce only 91 gears for every 100
they could make a few years earlier.
   ``It's not a typical rust belt industry,'' says Michael Bradley,
a professor of economics at George Washington University.
   ``They've worked hard to acquire capital. They've increased
their productivity and they make a real effort to keep their
technological edge.''
   He said that unlike some other industries, American gear-makers
have not switched much of their own production to other countries
to take advantage of lower wages.
   Bradley analyzed the report for the American Gear Manufacturers'
Association. He predicted the situation of the American industry
would improve.
   The report said the number of jobs in the U.S. gear-making
industry dropped to 84,600 in 1988 from 87,800 in 1984. The average
wage fell to $17.87 an hour from $18.17, when accounting for
inflation.
   ``Wages for production workers in West Germany are higher than
in the United States,'' the report said.
   ``However, West German companies offset the difference with
higher productivity, achieved in part through the use of newer,
faster machines and factory automation.''
   In 1984, U.S. industry sold $246 million worth of gears in other
countries beyond what it bought. By 1988 it was buying $316 million
worth more than it sold. The U.S. industry still led the world in
know-how about gears in space and in the air, but West Germany was
the leader for cars, trucks and ships _ and gears for cars are by
far the biggest part of the industry.
   During the four years the U.S. industry increased its exports,
to $2.4 billion from $2 billion. But imports rose more: to $2.7
billion from $1.7 billion. They came from France and Canada as well
as from Japan and West Germany.
   The commission said imports increased because American
manufacturers bought cheaper goods from abroad, West European and
Japanese producers made concerted and successful efforts to get
into the U.S. market, and manufacturers of Japanese cars in this
country bought parts at home.
   The strong dollar, which made imports relatively cheaper in this
country, also was an element. The dollar has weakened since 1985.
Richard B. Norment, executive director of the manufacturers
association, said in an interview that the effect of that may have
started to appear. At least, the excess of imports over exports did
not increase much in 1989, he said.
   The U.S. gear-making industry increased spending on research and
development from $53 million to $78 million, but that was still
less than $1 out of every $100 worth of gears shipped. In 1985,
U.S. universities spent less than $1 million on gear research,
while universities in West Germany _ which has only a quarter of
the U.S. population _ spent $3.8 million, and universities in Japan
_ less than half the U.S. population _ spent $5 million.
   In the period covered by the report, U.S. manufacturers spent
$264 million for new tools, compared with $428 million for Japanese
manufacturers and $543 million for West German manufacturers.
   ``U.S. and foreign gear-making machine tool builders selling in
the U.S. market indicate that the U.S. industry is slow to adopt
leading edge technology machinery,'' the report said.
   ``These sources cite as an explanation the short-term management
outlook, lack of tax incentives, high debt loads and pressure for
frequent cost reductions common among U.S. producers.''

   Tim Robbins has a simple theory for what's
ailing his character in ``Cadillac Man,'' a Queens cowboy riding
shotgun with an AK-47.
   ``Too much sugar, too much caffeine,'' is how he assesses the
manic Larry Kosciuski. ``He's out of control.'' And what about the
laidback video producer of ``Tapeheads''? ``Low energy,'' the actor
comments, ``not enough sugar.''
   Robbins is saying this as he digs into a Kosciuski-like lunch
consisting of a hamburger, fries and caffeine-rich soda. But his
demeanor is as mild as cottage cheese, and with his wire-rimmed
glasses, and short, gelled hair, it's hard to imagine him as the
trigger-happy Kosciuski or womanizing ``Nuke'' Laloosh of ``Bull
Durham.''
   Questions about his private life are off-limits. He lives with
his ``Bull Durham'' co-star Susan Sarandon and their baby son, Jack
Henry. But he won't talk about them.
   Calm as he sits in an overstuffed brown chair, his legs crossed,
a cigarette dangling in his right hand, he sees nothing
``extraordinary'' about what he does, insisting that kind of talk
is only for magazines.
   But Robbins admits he didn't always feel that way. Determined at
an early age to be an actor, he wanted to attend New York's High
School of Performing Arts, dreaming of immersing himself in a world
of aspiring performers.
   Fortunately, the actor says, his father wouldn't let him.
   ``I didn't understand what he meant at the time, but now I
realize what he was talking about,'' the 32-year-old actor recalled
in an interview at his publicist's Manhattan offices.
   ``I wanted to surround myself with people that are only
interested in show business. It would have limited my perceptions
and input. He said when you get to be 17 and go to college you can
decide. Until then, you need a basic education.
   ``I learned so much about people and acting in courses like
anthropology, and psychology and history,'' said Robbins. ``In a
lot of ways, the best way to study isn't to study acting. It's
studying different worlds.''
   So off screen, Robbins is a self-described ``active participant
in the democratic process,'' at ease with the local butcher and
shoestore owner, more likely to show up at Knicks and Rangers games
than Hollywood premieres.
   On screen, he's a lot flashier, brawling with Kevin Costner in
``Bull Durham,'' wrecking a beauty pagaent in ``Miss Firecracker,''
crashing his motorcycle through the plate-glass window of Turgeon
Luxury Auto Sales in ``Cadillac Man.''
   Again, Robbins was just following some good advice.
   ``One of my teachers taught me the important lesson that any
time you make an entrance to be a 100 percent possessed of your
character. In our training, he would not let an actor enter unless
he was completely in character and told a story.
   ``It was two weeks before I could make an entrance and I started
to understand the discipline one has to have in order to maintain
that kind of commitment. It especially helps in the waning hours
when you're working at 2 in the morning.''
   Robbins attended State University of New York, then transferred
to the theater program at the University of California at Los
Angeles. In 1981, he helped found The Actors Gang in Los Angeles
and still is an active member, recently directing and co-writing
``Carnage,'' which was staged in New York and Los Angeles.
   For film, he's had his greatest success playing dumb, portraying
characters with quick reflexes and slow minds. Laloosh is the
perfect example, a fastball pitcher and junk food eater Robbins
describes as ``a few seconds behind everyone else.''
   An exception was ``Tapeheads,'' when a bout with mononucleosis
helped Robbins prepare for his part.
   ``I didn't even know it until a week before we ended shooting. I
was going around completely lethargic, which is OK for that
character. I lucked out there. I just want to say that that's my
first and last mononucleic performance.''
   In you want to see the ``real'' Tim Robbins on screen, or
someone close to it, the actor suggests checking out ``Five
Corners,'' in which he plays a man of constructive action, a former
street fighter inspired by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to
register voters in Mississippi in the 1960s.
   He remembers that film as his most enjoyable. It was shot in New
York, the hours were reasonable, the people friendly and the script
by John Patrick Shanley (``Moonstruck'') was in tune with his own
beliefs.
   ``I try not to do things that are gratuitously violent or
sexist. There's a lot of racism or sexism in scripts I read.
Sometimes it's just a line or two. It shows me something about the
sensitivity of the writer involved.
   ``At the heart of it I want to know that the intentions are
good, that what's trying to be said is a positive thing.''
   Robbins will work with The Actors Gang this summer and can next
be seen on film in ``Jacob's Ladder,'' a thriller directed by
Adrian Lyne (``Fatal Attraction''). He's playing a smart fellow,
Robbins says, a guy with a Ph.D.
   And a good diet?
   ``Yes,'' he said, grinning, and reached for another french fry.

   Timber man Jim Coleman's boot makes the
same print in the forest floor as biologist Ralph Costa's, and both
men call themselves environmentalists.
   The similarities end when they talk about a humble little bird
called the red-cockaded woodpecker and the complex new rules to
preserve a million acres of Southern pine woods for the endangered
creature's home.
   Three logging contracts signed by Coleman's small company were
scrapped when the U.S. Forest Service regulations changed to give
the bird more space, and he sees layoffs looming in the region's
biggest industry.
   ``If we were out there destroying the environment, that'd be one
thing,'' says Coleman, whose Callahan Timber Co. planted more than
1 million seedlings last year. ``We're at a loss. We don't
understand.''
   Costa, who oversees a program to save the woodpecker in the
Appalachicola National Forest 200 miles away, says timber interests
alone must not drive decisions about federal woodlands.
   ``Public lands are going to be the last places that things
survive, pieces of the world _ whether it's a woodpecker or a bald
eagle,'' he said. ``They're the bastions.''
   Disagreement about the red-cockaded woodpecker has generated
legal briefs and government studies that now stack up well over the
bird's seven-inch height.
   The species, named for the tiny badges of red plumage behind the
male's eyes, has been on the endangered list since 1970.
   Perhaps 10,000 birds remain, the rest falling prey to flying
squirrels, snakes and even other woodpeckers that take over the
cavities they painstakingly dig in living pine trees.
   Man, often unwittingly, has been the birds' adversary, too,
consuming much of their habitat _ parklike stands of old pines to
nest in and enough surrounding woods to forage for insects, find
mates and expand their clans.
   As the Sun Belt's population has grown, developers have turned
woods into housing tracts. Loggers have replaced swaths of old
forest with tree crops, raised and cut in cycles.
   And the government routinely has extinguished the fires caused
by lightning that actually helped the woodpecker by burning out
hardwoods that spring up beneath tall pines, blocking nest cavities
and giving predators easier access.
   ``By far the largest factor has been clearcutting, destruction
of the habitat and suppression of fire,'' says Doug Honnold of the
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.
   The group accused the Forest Service in a lawsuit of
jeopardizing the species in Texas, and in 1988, a judge agreed,
banning clearcutting and other timber industry methods within
three-quarters of a mile of woodpecker colony sites. The case is on
appeal.
   After a similar suit was threatened concerning national forests
in eight other Southern states, the agency last year applied a
three-quarter-mile protection zone to those areas, too.
   It then was the timber industry's turn to sue, citing the Forest
Service's historic mandate ``to furnish a continuous supply of
timber.''
   It also contended the agency had failed to fully implement
earlier, less restrictive guidelines for the bird, and hadn't
followed required procedures in changing the rules.
   ``Unfortunately, we're fighting procedure versus emotion,'' says
Deborah Baker of the Atlanta-based industry group that filed suit,
the Forest Service Timber Purchasers Council.
   The three-quarter-mile radius encompasses 1,100 acres. That's
1.2 million acres for all the known colonies, compared with 502,000
restricted acres under the previous rules, which set only a
half-mile zone, according to the American Forest Council in
Washington.
   Ron Escano, the Forest Service official in charge of protecting
endangered species in the Southeast, says the acreage was added to
give the birds space to expand colonies, not merely maintain
existing ones. In all but three national forests that have the
woodpeckers, the population seemed to be declining under the old
rules, he says.
   The new rules are interim measures while a two-year
environmental impact assessment is completed, he says.
   Meanwhile, Escano insists, timber cutting can occur within the
current zones _ ``it's just that it has to be designed to benefit
the woodpecker.''
   Asked about the industry's complaint that the new rules reduced
timber harvests by a total of 73 million board feet this year and
last, Escano says, ``In relation to total volume cut ... it's quite
small.''
   He acknowledges, however, ``If you look at individual forests
and individual operators, it could be a very different story.''
   According to Michael Sparks, a Forest Service timber sales
official, the impact will be greatest in coastal areas from East
Texas to North Carolina.
   In fiscal 1989, about 1.2 billion board feet of timber was cut
on Southeast national forests, a drop from the previous five years.
The value fell to $76.8 million after hovering around $100 million
annually through that period.
   Woodpecker protection is certainly not the only factor
influencing volume, but the new guidelines are being felt.
   Jim Coleman doesn't know how much it cost Callahan Timber when
three contracts for northern Florida's Osceola National Forest were
canceled and then renegotiated because of the rule change.
   ``It's really hurt the industry down here,'' he says. ``When you
pull timber off the market, then this timber has to be found
somewhere _ and if it can't be found, then these mills start
shutting down.''
   One mill he's thinking of is a utility-pole operation owned
jointly by Callahan Timber and Richard Cochran.
   Cochran echoes a complaint often heard in timbering areas, that
the bird is really a surrogate, ``a tool ... for people who just
don't want to cut any timber.''
   ``If we could reason with each other, we should have enough
middle ground,'' he says.
   ``No, the time for compromise is over,'' says Gary Henry, who
oversees red-cockaded woodpecker preservation for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. ``That's what's been occurring for years ...
hoping that this was adequate for the woodpecker. It's very obvious
today that it is not adequate.''
   Couldn't the industry simply turn to private lands for raw
material?
   There are 164 million acres of private timberland in the
Southeast, many times the total national forest acreage, according
to the American Forest Council. But much private land is less
carefully managed and quality is often lower, industry officials
say.
   Ralph Costa drives past miles of private timberlands, paper
company plantations, on his commute to work in the Appalachicola
National Forest, home to 1,000 or so of the woodpeckers, more than
anywhere else. It doesn't bother him to see trees cut on private
land.
   But, he says, ``I don't think that national forests or any
public lands, for that matter, should necessarily have an objective
of producing a cash crop.''
   Deer hunting is permitted to thin herds. ``Cutting a tree ought
to be the same way. We ought to take trees for the health of the
ecosystem,'' says Costa, who's often in the woods before dawn to
band red-cockadeds or move birds from his forest to others,
sometimes providing mates in colonies that have dwindled to a
single bird.
   ``People ask me what's the value of a woodpecker,'' Costa says,
answering with an analogy: ``You can take a nice fancy spider web
and start cutting the threads. You're going to clip one thread
eventually and the spider web is going to collapse.
   ``And we can keep throwing species off the planet, which we're
doing, and eventually something's going to go wrong.''

   The red-cockaded woodpecker, once common in the Southeast, still
ranges from Texas to the Carolinas, but is found mainly in isolated
populations on federal lands.
   The birds live in small flocks, called clans, boring nesting
holes in living pine trees about 60 or more years old. The cluster
of trees where the woodpeckers roost is called a colony.
   According to the U.S. Forest Service, the greatest numbers of
known active colonies are found in the Appalachicola National
Forest in Florida, with 693, the Kisatchie National Forest in
Louisiana, with 314, and the Francis Marion National Forest in
South Carolina, where the number dropped after Hurricane Hugo from
487 in 1988 to an estimated 320 to 340 today.
   Other national forests:
   Talladega (Ala.), 162 active colonies; Sam Houston (Texas), 133;
Bienville (Miss.), 88; Oseola (Fla.), 50; Croatan (N.C.), 45;
Angelina-Sabine (Texas), 34; Davy Crockett (Texas), 27; Homochitto

<HEAD>Democrats See Quayle as an Issue in 1992</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's seldom been much mileage in vice
presidential candidates as campaign issues, but some Democrats
think that with Dan Quayle as their target, they can make 1992 an
exception.
   Nobody comes on stronger about making Quayle a major issue than
the man who lost the vice presidency to him last time. ``Damn
right,'' said Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas. ``If he's still on
the ticket he will be.''
   President Bush has said that Quayle absolutely will be his
running mate again in 1992, a commitment that overrules but has not
quashed rumors of a possible switch.
   A change wouldn't be Bush's style. He is committed, long in
advance. He praises Quayle's performance as vice president. And he
puts a premium on loyalty.
   Nor are there promising precedents. The last overhaul of a
ticket that won was in 1944, when Harry S. Truman became Franklin
D. Roosevelt's vice presidential nominee.
   Dwight D. Eisenhower thought about a switch in 1956, suggesting
to Richard M. Nixon that he might be better off running the
Pentagon than serving as vice president as he prepared to seek the
White House himself. Nixon knew better.
   Nixon considered John B. Connally as a second-term running mate,
but didn't push it. Spiro T. Agnew was by then a conservative
favorite, and Connally wasn't yet established as a Republican.
   President Gerald R. Ford remodeled his appointed ticket in 1976,
dropping Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, which placated
conservative Republicans. Ford ran, and lost, with Sen. Robert J.
Dole of Kansas.
   There is always midterm speculation about vice presidents, their
relationships with the boss and their prospects for the future.
That's a special problem for Quayle, who, as Nixon said, ``starts
from a low base, and he would be the first to admit that.''
   Quayle does, but he also insists that the poll ratings reflect
inaccurate perceptions, not reality, and that his standing is
improving.
   Nixon, who served two terms as vice president and got to pick
three vice presidential nominees himself, said in a television
interview that Quayle has ``taken all the criticism with pose, with
dignity.''
   ``In my view, Dan Quayle will be on the ticket, not just because
George Bush is loyal, which he is perhaps to a fault, but because
he will not be a liability by the time the election rolls around,''
Nixon said.
   Bentsen, predictably, forecasts the opposite, saying that voters
will be paying more attention to Quayle, not less, in the next
national election.
   ``They think, here we go, another cycle, and a president, he's
mortal like all of us, and we ought to be thinking again about this
choice,'' Bentsen said.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, isn't so
sure. ``I think it's too early to tell whether it can be used and
what effect it would have,'' Mitchell says, noting that there was
no clear impact on the 1988 election.
   Republican pollster Lance Tarrance of Houston said earlier this
year that he thinks Quayle could become a major issue and a
significant problem for the Republicans in 1992. Tarrance said that
as President Bush seeks a second term, voters will begin to focus
on Quayle as a potential president, not only as an understudy.
   Perhaps so. And perhaps it would turn some votes away from Bush.
But it would have to be a tight race to make a discernible
difference on election day. Unless Quayle blundered into a new
controversy, it's difficult to see how the Democrats could hammer
him any harder than they did in 1988.
   As he campaigns for Republican candidates in this year's
elections, Quayle's standard response to recurring questions about
his 1992 role is that the choice will be made by the president, and
that he is simply going to keep doing his job.
   Bush says he is doing it well. So does Sen. Richard G. Lugar,
whose name was on the guess lists in 1988 until Bush chose his
junior partner from Indiana for the vice presidential nomination.
   Lugar said Quayle does a good job, but added that he isn't
surprised at the persistent image problem. ``It's sort of hard to
break the mold,'' Lugar said. ``I think Dan Quayle understands
that. It's not a short-term problem.''

<HEAD>Scientists Seek New Medicines from Marine Creatures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponges, algae and other ocean creatures are
yielding new substances that hold promise as medicines against
cancer, psoriasis, parasites and infectious diseases such as AIDS,
scientists say.
   The search for drugs from the sea focuses on organisms that lack
physical defenses and therefore must produce chemicals to protect
themselves against predators, said John Faulkner, a marine chemist
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.
   ``They don't have spines. They don't have shells. They can't
run. They're just a blob on the reef, and they look like food but
they're not eaten,'' Faulkner said. ``When we see something like
that we say, `Aha! This must be chemically protected.'''
   Manoalides _ a class of anti-inflammatory drugs derived from
sponges that live near Palau in the North Pacific _ now are being
tested on humans with psoriasis, an unsightly thickening of the
skin that causes painful cracks and blistering.
   Manoalides could be on the market in three or four years, and a
few other drugs derived from marine creatures are expected within
10 years, said biochemist David Attaway, director of marine
biotechnology for the National Sea Grant College Program in Silver
Spring, Md.
   Faulkner and Attaway were among 35 scientists at a workshop on
drugs from the sea this month at the University of California,
Santa Barbara.
   ``Increasingly, scientists are turning to marine organisms in
their search for new pharmaceuticals because of diminishing returns
from continued screening of land-based plants and animals,'' UCSB
spokesman David Salisbury said.
   UCSB workshop participants reported they have identified
marine-derived drugs using funds from the Sea Grant program, which
Attaway said has spent $700,000 to $800,000 per year on such
research since 1977.
   Chemist Phil Crews, of the University of California, Santa Cruz,
extracted two compounds from sponges near Fiji and Vanuatu in the
South Pacific.
   In test-tube experiments, the substances appeared effective in
combatting tape worms and other parasites, including some that
plague cattle and sheep. The chemicals also show some ability to
fight viral diseases, and one of them can inhibit the activity of
an enzyme that lets the AIDS virus reproduce itself.
   William Fenical, of Scripps, said a number of marine bacteria
show promise as antibiotics.
   Jay Burgess, of UCSB, is studying how calcium moves and is
deposited inside red algae. Attaway said that might help scientists
understand and treat diseases such as arthritis and lupus.
   Richard Moore, of the University of Hawaii, outlined efforts to
use blue-green algae to produce tumor-fighting substances.
Preliminary tests show ``a number of very active compounds,''
Attaway said.
   Faulkner said the government is investigating one substance
derived from blue-green algae as a possible anti-AIDS medicine.
Other substances purified from sea plants or animals are being
developed as possible drugs to fight fungal infections, Faulkner
said.
   ``About 50 percent of the drugs in use at the moment are from
natural sources,'' mostly terrestrial, he said. ``And a large
number of the ones that are synthetic started out as a compound
that was from a natural source but then was modified and improved.''
   Drugs developed from living organisms include many used for
cancer chemotherapy, as well as antibiotics derived from bacteria
or fungi that were genetically altered, he said.
   Some medicines were developed from sea creatures even before the
Sea Grant program started its search in 1977. Attaway said sponges
yielded a class of compounds that have anti-tumor properties and
also combat certain diseases caused by viruses, including viral
encephalitis, a brain inflammation.
   Attaway said that compared with land organisms, sea plants and
animals yield a high ``number of novel substances that prove to
have some effect on a biochemical or physiological process in
another organism. Those are the processes you need to control to
cure or control disease.''
   Faulkner said scientists search for sea-derived medicines partly
by intuition. Plants or creatures that might have drugs are chopped
up or soaked in alcohol to derive a crude extract, which then is
tested.
   In perhaps 20 years, scientists should be able to take cells
from drug-producing sea organisms, culture the cells in the
laboratory, and then manipulate the cells' genes to make them
efficient drug factories, Attaway said.
   But like many scientists, he complained that progress has been
slowed by limits on funds due to inflation and federal budget
restrictions. Drug companies have been slow to take up such
research, but their interest is increasing as many marine
scientists trained with Sea Grant funds go to work in industry,
Attaway said.
   ``That's going to be the key to making this work really
meaningful,'' Attaway said.

   Victor Yingst is on the trail of a
killer on Florida's palm-shaded Gulf coast.
   He knows the stalker's methods by heart.
   ``First the coconuts fall, then the fronds turn a bright yellow
and soon the tree is dead,'' said Yingst, who has spent more than
three years battling lethal yellowing disease for the Lee County
Extension Service.
   After wiping out thousands of palms in the Caribbean and
southeastern Florida, the infestation is spreading into one of the
last untouched regions for the majestic Jamaican Tall palm and
other susceptible exotic species.
   The insect-carried disease _ moving inland from beaches _ has
agriculture experts fearing a recurrence of the palm die-offs in
southern Florida in the 1970s. Tourism officials worry about a
change in the tropical appeal of southeastern Florida.
   ``Lethal yellowing is sort of like a fire,'' said Yingst. ``If
left unchecked it will spread farther and farther. It could really
rob this area of its special beauty.''
   Although lethal yellowing has been studied for nearly 100 years,
there is no known cure. But recently tree inoculations and
plantings of resistant palms have helped somewhat to contain the
disease, caused by a cellular organism called mycoplasmas that live
on the palm fronds' soft core.
   Trees usually die within three to six months of showing the
first symptoms of lethal yellowing.
   The earliest known reference to a coconut tree disorder was made
in 1834 on Grand Cayman Island. By the late 19th century,
scientists were examining lethal yellowing in Jamaica, where the
coconut crop was a valuable export.
   Lethal yellowing jumped over to the Florida Keys in the 1950s
and moved onto the mainland near Miami in 1971. Presently, the
disease has claimed about 200,000 coconut palms and nearly 100,000
other species in Florida as far north as Jupiter, about 80 miles
from Miami, according to the University of Florida.
   In Texas, lethal yellowing has spread to date palms, creating
concern in the date-growing regions of Arizona and California.
Overseas, the disease ranges from West Africa across the Caribbean
to Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
   ``What you're left with is a trunk _ like a telephone pole _
that just rots until it eventually falls over. It's really ugly,''
said Yingst.
   As head of the Lee County lethal yellowing control effort,
Yingst has organized groups of residents and landscapers to monitor
its progress and inject healthy trees with a tetracycline-based
antibiotic. Also, resistant palms such as the popular malayan dwarf
variety are being planted around healthy coconut palms as a buffer.
   Sherry Marinello, who operates a landscaping service, said she
has inoculated about 1,300 trees in Fort Myers and Fort Myers
Beach, where the disease was first spotted on the Gulf coast.
   ``To see a picture of what this place looked like two years ago
and what it looks like now would shock you,'' she said. ``It's a
serious problem that could really change the character of this
place if it's not stopped.''

<HEAD>Americans Don't Consume Enough Calcium, Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans are getting only a third to half the
calcium they need, despite the ``calcium craze'' that sent people
running to drugstores for pills to supplement their diets.
   Much has been made of calcium in recent years because of
osteoporosis, the weakening of the bones, generally with age, due
to loss of calcium, declining levels of sex hormones, hereditary
factors and other things.
   Women generally become susceptible at menopause, men at a later
age. The disease is estimated to be responsible for more than 1
million hip fractures each year.
   A National Institutes of Health panel in 1984 recommended women
consume a gram to 1{ grams a day of calcium. Now, there are dozens
of supplements on the market, and manufacterers have enriched a
variety of foods with calcium.
   Still, there is no clear proof that calcium will prevent the
debilitating disease.
   ``It remains a very controversial subject,'' said Bess
Dawson-Hughes, an endocrinologist at the Calcium and Bone
Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts University's Human Nutrition
Research Center.
   The NIH panel said calcium won't hurt and there is ``a
reasonable chance it will help. That message got twisted to, `If
you take a gram to a gram and half you won't get osteoporosis,'''
she said.
   Several long-term studies are under way, she said. But until the
data is in, there are several variables, including whether calcium
affects people differently at different ages and whether it affects
different bones differently.
   ``Calcium appears to have a bright and exciting future in
preventive medicine,'' and is being studied for connections to
several diseases, Sheldon Saul Hendler wrote in ``The Doctors'
Vitamin and Mineral Encyclopedia.''
   But Americans get only a third to half the calcium they need for
good health, according to Hendler.
   Researchers from the University of Michigan last month presented
a study showing that eating calcium-rich foods does not prevent
osteoporosis. The researchers compared hand X-rays of men and women
taken in 1963-65 and again in 1985. The subjects also reported
their eating habits.
   ``Do not eat dairy products to prevent osteoporosis. Their
protein content can accelerate the loss of calcium from bones,''
Dr. Andrew Weil said in his book, ``Natural Health, Natural
Medicine.'' A better way to promote bone density is
weight-resistance exercises, he said.
   Calcium is needed to build strong bones and teeth and helps
regulate nerve and muscle function, among other things. Severe
deficiency can lead to abnormal heartbeat, dementia, muscle spasms
and convulsions, Hendler writes.
   Dairy products are the main source of calcium in the diet. For
those who are lactose intolerant or for other reasons don't eat
dairy, calcium can be had from kale or collard greens, molasses,
sesame seeds, salmon, broccoli, yogurt and tofu.
   A cup of milk has 290 milligrams of calcium; four ounces of tofu
contain 154 milligrams.
   Young women on weight-reducing diets often stop eating dairy
products, though skim milk is as good a provider of calcium as
whole milk. Bone mass development is at its peak from ages 18 to
25, yet surveys show that at least a quarter of the women in this
age group consume less than 300 milligrams a day of calcium.
   The average American's diet supplies 600 to 800 milligrams of
calcium a day, said Richard Mazess, professor emeritus of medical
physics at the University of Wisconsin.
   While there appears to be no major risk in following the NIH
panel's 1984 advice, Dawson-Hughes noted that if calcium is not
effective, research time and money should be used another way.
   Calcium supplements also cost money. ``So if it's not doing
anything, it's real important to know that,'' she said.

<HEAD>Engineers Say Martial Arts Protective Gear Inadequate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers who practice the Korean
martial art tae kwon do used a mechanical leg and videotapes of
sparring sessions to conclude that currently accepted protective
gear is inadequate.
   The study found that a tae kwon do kick can carry the same
energy as a major league fastball racing at 90 mph, and can cave in
a person's chest by as much as two inches, creating a high risk of
internal injuries.
   The study was conducted by University of California, Berkeley,
mechanical engineering Professor Dennis Lieu, who twice needed
hospital attention after keeling over from tae kwon do blows even
though he was wearing protective gear. His co-author was
engineering student and 1989 National Collegiate Taekwondo Champion
Elaine Serina.
   Tae kwon do originally was taught for warfare, self-defense and
fitness. It has gained wide popularity as a competitive sport and
was introduced as a demonstration event at the 1988 Olympics in
South Korea.
   Lieu and Serina used high-speed videotape to record a sparring
session between them, then analyzed the tapes at slow speed.
   ``I remember asking her to kick me so we could have it on
tape,'' Lieu recalled. ``She did, and I bent over in pain and wound
up on the floor.''
   The engineers then developed a mechanical leg to recreate tae
kwon do kicks under laboratory conditions, using torso models
similar to those used in automobile crash experiments.
   They concluded existing protective gear is much too soft, and
needs to be more rigid in critical areas to adequately protect
against internal injuries.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Campaigns Are Effective, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette smoking dropped 2{ percent
during the first year of an anti-tobacco advertising campaign in
two Australian cities, suggesting a similar effort in California
will succeed, a researcher says.
   That ``may not sound like a tremendous drop, but it is,'' said
John P. Pierce, an associate professor of community and family
medicine at the University of California, San Diego.
   The same reduction in the United States would mean hundreds of
thousands fewer smokers, said Pierce, who studied the effectiveness
of the Australian television advertising blitz while working at the
University of Sydney.
   Pierce's study was published in the May issue of the American
Journal of Public Health. He presented the unpublished findings to
California's Legislature last August, helping persuade lawmakers to
spend cigarette tax money for a $28.6 million media campaign that
was launched April 10.
   ``The Australian campaign is the prototype for the California
campaign,'' Pierce said. ``If the campaign can achieve similar
results here, it means there would be 660,000 fewer smokers in
California by mid-1991.''
   TV commercials that focused on the health hazards of smoking
aired during prime time for six to eight weeks each year, starting
in 1983 in Sydney and 1984 in Melbourne.
   Pierce and his colleagues surveyed 20,000 residents of Sydney
and Melbourne. They found the 2{ percent drop in smoking one year
after the campaign started. In subsequent years, smoking among
Australian men dropped an additional 1{ percent per year, but
didn't drop further among women _ a difference Pierce said isn't
yet understood.
   Before joining UCSD in January, Pierce worked at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control as chief epidemiologist in the Office
on Smoking and Health.

<HEAD>Breasts Can Be Rebuilt Using Thigh Tissue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are starting to use thigh tissue to
rebuild breasts for women who underwent mastectomy due to breast
cancer.
   Silicone implants now are the most common form of breast
reconstruction, followed by the transplant of skin, fat and muscle
taken from the abdomen and buttocks.
   But three Atlanta plastic surgeons say ``thigh flaps'' _ or
tissue taken from the thighs _ also can be used.
   Some women would prefer to have excess tissue removed from their
thighs than from their abdomen or buttocks. Others might need to
use the thigh tissue method, said L. Franklyn Elliott, one of the
surgeons who reported on the new method earlier this year in the
journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
   Some women may be unable to have their abdominal tissue used
either because they don't have enough or because they have
abdominal scars from previous surgery, Elliott said. The thighs
have longer veins and arteries than buttock tissue, providing
better blood flow to the reconstructed breast, he added.
   Dr. William Shaw, head of plastic surgery at the University of
California, Los Angeles, cautions that use of thigh flaps has
drawbacks. Fatty tissue isn't as consistently plentiful in the
thighs as in the buttocks, so the use of thigh flaps poses a risk
of creating deformities in the thighs, or of making one thigh
appear smaller than the other, he said.
   Elliott replied that as surgeons become more experienced using
thigh flaps, they will become more skilled in using liposuction and
other methods to minimize disfigurement and to match the two thighs.
   ``Generally, my patients who have chosen breast reconstruction
using thigh flaps have preferred the resulting deformity to the
`saddlebags' they had before,'' he said.

   The supermarket tabloids are being devoured!
   The Globe, National Examiner and Sun are the latest gossipy
weeklies about to fall under new ownership.
   The much-larger National Enquirer and its sister publication
Weekly World News were bought out last year. Star magazine is in
the process of changing owners.
   Industry analysts were hard-pressed to find a common link among
the sales, however. The National Enquirer was sold after its
founder died. Star no longer fit the strategic plans of Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.
   The latest acquisition would give British media baron Robert
Maxwell a chance to put his experience with tabloids in Europe to
work in the United States.
   Maxwell said Wednesday his Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. has
agreed to buy the Globe, National Examiner and Sun from Globe
International Publishing Inc.
   Terms were not disclosed but industry executives said the three
magazines could command somewhere between $100 million and $200
million.
   Globe International, a privately-held publishing concern based
in Montreal, said the combined circulation of the three magazines
exceeds 2.5 million.
   Only last year, the much larger National Enquirer and Weekly
World News were sold for $412.5 million to a group that included
Macfadden Holdings Inc., a media investment firm, and Boston
Ventures Management.
   The new owners of that company, known as G.P. Group Inc. of
Lantana, Fla., subsequently agreed in late March to buy Star from
News Corp. for $400 million in cash and stock.
   The National Enquirer has a circulation of more than 4.1 million
while Star ranks second among supermarket tabloids at 3.6 million.
Weekly World News sells nearly 850,000 copies a week.
   The Globe International tabloids, whcih are published in Boca
Raton, Fla., would be Maxwell's first magazines in the United
States, where his main interest has been book publishing and
information services.
   But his Mirror Group PLC publishes the Daily Mirror, the United
Kingdom's second largest newspaper. Its other British newspapers
include Sporting Life and the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail in
Scotland.
   Mirror Group also recently launched The European, an
English-language weekend newspaper for Europe.
   Maxwell reportedly lost out in bidding for the National Enquirer.
   The Globe and the National Examiner each have been published for
about 35 years. The Globe originated as a local entertainment
magazine in Montreal called Midnight while the National Examiner
had its roots in the Midwest, according to Globe International
spokesman Dean Heine.
   He said Mike Rosenbloom, the owner of Globe International,
acquired both the Globe and National Examiner about 20 years ago.
Rosenbloom started Sun about nine years ago.
   The Audit Bureau of Circulations said Globe had an average
circulation of 1.33 million in the six months ended Dec. 31, down
12.9 percent from a year earlier, while National Examiner averaged
nearly 894,000, down 20.2 percent.
   The Bureau does not audit circulation figures for Sun, but Heine
said its circulation is about 450,000 a week.
   Heine said the three magazines emphasize entertainment and
generally have moved away from the gruesome stories that once
characterized the supermarket tabloids.
   In the current edition of Globe, the cover features photos of
actresses Vanna White and Linda Evans to accompany a featured story
alleging they are ``in a bitter battle for the same man.''
   The National Examiner has cover stories claiming that former
evangelist Jim Bakker is going insane and describing the plight of
a tourist whose prosthetic plastic nose melted in the Florida heat.
   ``Jesus back on earth, say scholars'' reads another cover
headline.
   David Adler, a spokesman for Maxwell, said it is too early to
say what Maxwell's plans are for the three tabloids.
   The sale will leave Globe International with several
publications distributed mainly in supermarkets and convenience
stores, including so-called mini-mags that feature calorie counters
or horoscopes.
   It also publishes Bridal Guide, the humor magazine Cracked and
Your Health magazine as well as detective magazines and puzzle
books.

<HEAD>Northrop to Eliminate 3,000 Jobs in Latest Blow to California
Aerospace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. added to the litany of woes
for California's aerospace industry by announcing it would trim its
workforce by 7 percent because of defense spending cuts on its B-2
bomber.
   The company said it would eliminate 3,000 jobs by the end of the
year, including 2,700 in Southern California, through layoffs and
attrition.
   The cuts followed similar moves by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and
Lockheed Corp. and are expected to reverberate through thousands of
smaller firms in the industry.
   ``World events, government decisions, economic conditions, are
all evolving at a rapid rate _ at an unprecedented rate,'' Chief
Executive Kent Kresa said in announcing the layoffs.
   ``Questions are being asked about fundamental assumptions that
have not been questioned since many of us here were children,'' he
said in remarks prepared for Northrop's annual meeting Wednesday.
   The radar-dodging, bat-winged stealth bomber made up 58 percent
of Northrop's $1.28 billion in first-quarter sales this year.
   But because of easing world tensions, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has proposed cutting purchases of the bomber from 132 to 75.
Peak production would fall from 36 planes a year to 12.
   ``The party's over. There's going to be some pain,'' said Jack
Kyser, a Chamber of Commerce economist.
   Last week McDonnell Douglas said it would cut 4,000 jobs, mostly
in Long Beach, and Lockheed announced it would shut down in
Burbank, eliminating 4,500 local jobs over the next few years.
   Kyser said Northrop may have decided it was best to announce its
layoffs on the heels of bad news from the other companies.
   ``It may be the idea that the rain is already falling,'' he
said. ``They're in sort of a batten down the hatches, survival mode
anyway.''
   The layoffs could create a ripple effect through the aerospace
industry, the greatest source of manufacturing jobs in the region.
Kyser said 70 percent of the area's aerospace companies employ 50
or fewer workers. Kresa noted that Northrop has 6,000
subcontractors and suppliers in the region.
   ``On our major programs today, Northrop as prime contractor is
responsible for only 30 or 40 percent of the work; 60 to 70 percent
is done by our subcontractors and suppliers,'' Kresa said. ``They
also will be among the first to feel the effects of budget
reductions and stretchouts.''
   Northrop's employment peaked at 48,200 at the end of 1987. It
has cut 2,500 employees during the past year and now has about
41,000 workers.
   Kresa also said Northrop can eliminate its $1 billion in debt by
the mid-1990s through cost-cutting and sale of assets. He cited the
recent sale and partial leaseback of its corporate headquarters
complex, which produced an after-tax gain of $90 million and cut
the company's short-term debt by $218 million.
   Kresa also set a goal for Northrop, which lost $63.5 million
last year, or returning to the 20 percent return-on-equity level it
achieved in the mid-'80s.
   ``I was impressed by his comments,'' said Lawrence Harris, a
securities analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los
Angeles. ``The 20 percent return-on-equity goal is certainly
ambitious, but it's the kind of target the Street would be looking
for on a long-term basis.''
   Kresa said the slowdown in the B-2 program would allow Northrop
to proceed with full-scale development of the advanced tactical
fighter at its ultramodern Pico Rivera plant next year if the
company wins the contract on the next-generation fighter. A
Northrop-led team is competing with a Lockheed-led team.
   Harris said that statement suggests Northrop is studying the
possible sale of all or part of its Hawthorne facility, where it
does subcontracting work on Boeing 747s. He estimated the 218 acres
of land there is worth $114 million and the buildings another $296
million.
   Another possible target is a Ventura County plant that produces
targets and drones and has worked to develop the Tacit Rainbow
missile, Harris said. The missile will be produced in Georgia and
many engineering tasks already have been moved to Hawthorne. He
estimated the Ventura land and buildings could fetch $130 million.

<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. has become the nation's latest
retailer to seek bankruptcy court protection after being unable to
pay off a huge debt incurred during a rapid expansion program.
   The nation's second-largest convenience store chain said
Wednesday it resorted to a Chapter 11 filing after failing to reach
agreement with creditors on a plan to work out its debt problems.
   The filing surprised some analysts because Circle K last month
halted interest payments to bondholders under a tentative
debt-restructuring agreement with senior creditors and its largest
shareholder, American Financial Corp. The agreement included a
moratorium on senior debt payments through Oct. 31
   But Circle K spokesman Ray Cox said some senior creditors balked
at signing the standstill agreement. He declined to say which
lenders threw the company into bankruptcy but said American
Financial was not among them. The Cincinnati-based company owns
38.3 percent of Circle K's stock.
   ``I think most people felt that since they had been given until
October by their short-term creditors, they would put together a
restructuring plan and come out of it,'' said Dennis Telzrow, an
analyst with Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner of Dallas.
   Circle K listed $1.94 billion in assets and $1.58 billion in
liabilities, including $993.2 million in secured and unsecured
debts to 711 creditors. The other liabilities were claims by about
47,000 creditors, mostly suppliers to Circle K stores.
   The company isn't alone with its debt woes.
   Ames Department Stores and the department stores owned by
Campeau Corp. are reorganizing under Chapter 11, struggling with
debt taken on through takeovers. Debt problems forced Southland,
which has about 7,000 7-Eleven stores, to agree to sell a
controlling interest to Japan's 7-Eleven franchiser.
   Telzrow said investors' faith in management may have been shaken
during five years of unrelenting expansion under former chairman
Karl Eller, who resigned eight days before the Chapter 11 filing
late Tuesday.
   He said it is possible creditors might ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
George B. Nielsen Jr. to appoint a trustee to run the company.
   When Eller took over in mid-1983, Circle K had 1,200 stores in
11 states with annual sales of $750 million. By last November, it
had grown to a peak of 4,685 stores in 33 states and 1,386 licensed
or joint-venture stores in 13 foreign countries. Revenues last year
totaled $3.5 billion.
   The company incurred about $1.3 billion in debt to finance its
expansion, mainly high-interest junk bonds. Annual interest
payments exceeded $100 million.
   Eller tried to sell Circle K last summer but got nowhere, and he
came up short in his attempt at a leveraged buyout.
   Two months ago Circle K announced a $42 million operating loss
in the quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Company attorneys met Wednesday with the bankruptcy judge, but
Cox said he could not comment on the talks. He said company
attorneys didn't know when they would have a reorganization plan
ready.
   President Robert Dearth Jr. said Circle K stores and warehouses
would operate as usual. He said the company was optimistic about
receiving cooperation from its vendors.
   Circle K has announced plans to sell 350 stores in the Pacific
Northwest and another 25 in Hawaii, but neither sale has closed.
Those sales now would need the approval of the bankruptcy court to
proceed.
   Circle K now operates about 4,641 stores in 32 states, plus the
foreign stores.

<TEXT>
   The state claimed victory in its fight to
maintain competition at the grocery counter after California's
largest supermarket chain agreed to sell most of its Alpha Beta
stores to settle antitrust charges.
   Wednesday's decision by American Stores Co. of Salt Lake City
ended a 1{-year legal battle with California authorities over its
$2.5 billion acquisition of the Lucky supermarket chain.
   It also follows a key U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month that
allowed the state to sue the company to overturn the merger.
Previously, it had been widely assumed states and citizens could
not interfere with deals once they were completed.
   American Stores did not admit that the takeover was
anti-competitive and said it agreed to the settlement to avoid any
more costly legal battles.
   ``It is evident the time required and disruption caused by
further litigation with the attorney general would only serve to
create great confusion and uncertainty for employees, shareholders
and lenders,'' said J.L. Scott, chief executive of American Stores.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who had contended the merger
would hurt competition in the supermarket business, hailed the
agreement.
   ``This is wonderful news for California consumers struggling to
stretch their grocery dollar,'' said Van de Kamp.
   Under the terms of a consent decree, American Stores will
continue to operate Lucky but, within the next five years, must
sell 152 of Alpha Beta's 175 stores in Southern California. It also
will convert nine Alpha Betas into Lucky stores and sell nine Lucky
stores.
   Van de Kamp said American's operation of the remaining 14 Alpha
Beta stores would not hurt competition.
   American Stores also agreed to pay $550,000 to the Attorney
General's office to cover a portion of the attorneys fees and other
costs.
   The agreement was approved by U.S. District Judge David W.
Kenyon in Los Angeles, who would have presided over a trial.
   The deal puts no restrictions on American Store's future growth
in California and doesn't require the attorney general to approve
of the buyer, price or terms of the sale of the stores.
   Scott said American Stores expected to receive full value for
the Alpha Beta stores. In 1989, the 161 stores subject to divesture
earned $32.5 million on sales of $1.8 billion.
   American Stores completed the purchase of Dublin, Calif.-based
Lucky Stores Inc. in May 1988 to create the state's largest grocery
store chain with more than 500 stores and annual sales of more than
$20 billion.
   Four months later, Van de Kamp sued to block the merger on
grounds it was anti-competitive. American had contended the deal
would ultimately help consumers because Alpha Beta stores would
adopt Lucky's low-price policies.
   But a federal court forbade the joint operation of Lucky and
Alpha Beta until the matter could be resolved in court.
   In April, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 9-0 to empower Van de
Kamp to sue to undo the merger.
   Wednesday's agreement marked a political victory for Van de
Kamp, who is running against former San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
   The deal only affects Alpha Beta stores in Southern California.
In an earlier deal between American Stores and the state. American
Stores agreed to sell 13 of Alpha Betas Northern California stores
and integrate the other 23 into Lucky's chain.

   The sale of a van Gogh for a record $82.5
million bodes well for tonight's auction of a renowned Renoir
painting, but collectors aren't spending so freely for less
significant works, art experts said.
   Renoir's depiction of an open-air dance hall in Montmartre, ``Au
Moulin dela Galette,'' is to be auctioned at Sotheby's.
   On Tuesday night, van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was the
highlight of a contemporary art sale at Christie's, drawing a
record bid from a Japanese gallery.
   ``When you have a tremendous painting, like the van Gogh or the
Renoir that's coming up Thursday night, you're going to get
extraordinary prices,'' said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher
of ARTnews.
   Buyers are being selective, however, and only the most highly
prized works inspire frenzied bidding.
   Even with the van Gogh, Christie's entire sale brought a total
of $269.4 million. Although that was only $67,000 under the record
for an art auction held by Sotheby's, 24 of the 81 offerings did
not sell and some that did went for significantly less than their
pre-sale estimate.
   ``I think (Tuesday) night showed that the market is correcting
to a more realistic level,'' Esterow said.
   The Renoir is estimated by Sotheby's to sell for $40 to $50
million, the same presale estimate as the van Gogh. Its owner is
Betsey Cushing Whitney, the widow of John Hay Whitney, the
financier, publisher, sportsman and former ambassador to Britain.
   The large canvas captures an afternoon crowd of revelers beneath
a lush canopy of acacia trees at an open-air dance hall in
Montmartre that was popular in the artist's day.
   ``With the van Gogh taking such an unprecedented leap into $82
million that perhaps the other collectors will have to follow suit
and put their estimates a little bit higher as far as the Whitney
picture is concerned,'' said Harry Brooks, director of the
Wildenstein Gallery in Manhattan.
   The winning bid for ``Dr. Gachet'' was placed by Hideto
Kobayashi of the Gallery of Kobayashi of Tokyo. The gallery won a
heated bidding contest with an unidentified European buyer,
represented by Charles Allsopp, chairman of Christie's in London.
   The Japanese play a major role in the impressionist and
post-impressionist art market and accounted for a third of the
activity in the auction room, said Michael J. Findlay, who heads
the impressionist and modern art sales for Christie's. Americans
and Europeans represented the other two thirds, he said.
   Five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold at auction have
been bought by Japanese collectors, including Pablo Picasso's
``Pierrette's Wedding,'' purchased in 1987 for $51.3 million, and
van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' bought in 1987 for $39.9 million.
   The strong Japanese presence is attributed by art experts to the
wealth in Japan, bolstered the yen's rise against the dollar in
recent years. Also, Japan has a tradition since the 1930s of
collecting impressionist art.
   ``Van Gogh was an artist who was unabashedly an admirer of
Japanese art and prints,'' said Findlay. Many of the
impressionists' notions of composition _ like the flattened
perspective _ and color come directly from Japan, he said.
   David Nash, senior vice president in charge of fine arts at
Sotheby's in New York, said Japanese collectors had made inquiries
about ``Au Moulin de la Galette.''
   ``I have no predictions to make about what will happen to the
Renoir,'' Nash said. ``Obviously, it is encouraging to see that a
major 19th century painting can bring such a high price,'' he said
of the van Gogh.
   Renoir paintings have not fetched the top prices that van Gogh's
works have. The highest price paid for a Renoir was $17.7 million
in April 1989 for ``La Promenade''; it was bought by the J. Paul
Getty Museum. Until Tuesday night, the highest price ever paid for
a painting at auction was $53.9 million for van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   Esterow noted that substantially more Renoirs have been on the
market and that their quality is less consistent.
   But Findlay of Christie's said ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' was
special.
   ``There hasn't been a Renoir of that quality so we don't know
what the market will say about it,'' he said.

   A Philadelphia businessman who asked his
secretary to scout for good-looking women at a local pub and then
call him on a beeper to tell him of his prospects is a dubious
``winner'' in a national bosses' contest.
   Other bad and ``downright unbelievable'' bosses named Wednesday
included a New York supervisor who followed female employees to the
restroom and stood outside to time them.
   A boss at a brokerage firm in Cleveland was awarded a special
``boss-felon'' award for holding ``forgery contests'' among
secretaries to see who could best forge clients' signatures on
stocks and bonds.
   A boss in Gaylord, Minn., ``won'' for discriminating against
pregnant women.
   The contest, sponsored by a Cleveland support group for clerical
workers called 9to5, National Association of Working Women, also
honored ``good'' bosses.
   Those included the president of a computer services firm in
Birmingham, Ala., for progressive family leave policies; a
department chairman at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., for
advocating pay raises; and the chairman of Northwest Airlines for
making company employees ``feel like an asset to the airline.''
   Identities of the unbelievable and bad bosses were not released.
   A Philadelphia secretary who nominated her boss said she was
asked ``to go to a `beef &amp; beer' to check out girls before he
entered.
   ``He told me to beep him if there was anyone good-looking in the
bar so he wouldn't waste his time,'' the woman wrote.
   Another bad boss was nominated by a state worker in Madison,
Wis., whose mother had to be rushed to the hospital. The next day,
the worker asked for the afternoon off to visit her.
   ``Well ... go ahead. But next time you should plan these things
better,'' the boss responded.
   The manager of an insurance company in Boulder, Colo., also
``won'' for yelling at a female worker to bring coffee and adding,
``You squaw; me chief.''
   ``Common themes emerged in both the good and bad boss stories,''
said Ellen Bravo, associate director of 9to5. ``People want to be
appreciated and to be treated like human beings _ not like machines
or peons. And businesses that show regard for their employees
inspire loyalty and prosper as a result.''
   Judges who reviewed hundreds of entries submitted by office
workers nationwide included Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.;
Washington Post columnist Bob Levey; and Roberta McKay, who heads
the Labor Department's women's bureau.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Bounce Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today,
and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded moderately.
   The dollar closed at 152.00 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
close of 151.95 yen. It opened at 152.08 yen and ranged between
151.73 yen and 152.55 yen.
   When it reached 152.55, the dollar was sold for profit-taking
and position adjustments, said Takeshi Nagata, a dealer with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Ahead of the release of the U.S. trade figures later today,
market players tried to keep their dollar positions neutral,'' he
said.
   But Nagata said the dollar was unlikely to fall below 150 yen
``unless the U.S. trade figure has more than a 10 billion dollar
deficit.'' The market expects the U.S. March trade deficit to be
around $9.1 billion, up from $6.5 billion the previous month.
   ``Expectations for a slowdown in the U.S. economy have been
gradually factored into the market and are no longer a strong
incentive to sell the dollar,'' Nagata said.
   Some $11.4 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose
93.98 points, or 0.29 percent, closing at 32,061.60. It lost 29.42
points on Wednesday.
   The index rose slowly as market players became cautious after
the yen's lower opening in Tokyo this morning, traders said.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
the Nikkei began rising in late morning as investors started buying
shares in companies that have been performing well.
   ``Gains in the Nikkei's futures market also prompted buying in
the spot market,'' he said. ``But investors' targets tended to
shift from one issue to another, and trading was directionless.''
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 580
million shares, down from Wednesday's 750 million.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.70 points at 4 p.m. (3 a.m.
EDT) from Wednesday's close of 87.90. The yield stood at 7.020
percent, up from 6.780 percent the previous day.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Fails to Show Leadership on Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Meeting resumes 2 p.m. EDT; lead prospects uncertain; also

<TEXT>
   Capitol Hill Democrats say President Bush
lacks leadership and could doom the budget summit because of his
refusal to outline publicly the severity of the nation's budget
problems.
   ``This Congress won't be able to act unless the American people
feel there's a crisis,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
``There's only one person who can show the American people how bad
the crisis is.''
   ``This country is crying for leadership,'' said Rep. Marty
Russo, D-Ill., calling on Bush to cash in some of his popularity
for the good of the nation. ``You don't get to be great by making
no decisions,'' he said.
   The president said Wednesday he turned down a Democratic
suggestion that he make a nationally televised address to explain
why he called the summit on the budget deficit. The Democrats are
campaigning to make sure he shares the blame for any tax increase
that results.
   ``I don't want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the
markets,'' Bush said Wednesday. He said he would wait to make such
an address later, when he could present a bipartisan solution to
the problem.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., said Democrats were merely pushing
Bush to ``do a Jimmy Carter,'' referring to the former president's
unpopular penchant of reminding the nation of its problems.
   ``It's not a crisis. It's a manageable problem,'' Frenzel said
Wednesday after a meeting with White House budget director Richard
Darman and other members of the House Budget Committee.
   In the closed-door session, Darman continued his effort to
convince lawmakers that strong action must be taken to reduce the
deficit. Darman refused to appear before the committee in open
session.
   The budget summit talks were scheduled to resume this afternoon
with more discussion of the fiscal forecast for 1991.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the deficit for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 must be cut to no more than $74 billion or
automatic spending cuts will be imposed to make up the difference.
   The projected deficit, which the administration put near $100
billion four months ago, could be twice that if costs for the
bailout of the savings and loan industry are included. Not counting
the S&amp;L capital _ and the administration doesn't want it counted _
the deficit still would be $123 to $138 billion.
   So to avoid the huge automatic cuts, Congress and the president
must agree on around $50 billion in spending cuts and tax increases.
   The president is the only one who can build public acceptance of
the necessary sacrifices, and he has to start soon, Democrats said.
   ``He has to start now to sell the dimensions of the problem and
go before the people to talk about the seriousness of it,'' said
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. ``It should be a major address to the American people
... the longer he waits, the more difficult it will be.
   ``He can't wait to do that the night before the vote in a
fireside chat,'' said Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich. ``He has to lead.
He has to govern.''
   Kildee said he understood the president was already feeling
pressure from his own Republicans because of his wavering on the
``no new taxes'' pledge.
   ``I think he's torn between the politics and the governance,''
he said. ``And I hope he leans more toward governance.''
   The president's news conference Wednesday was aimed at
pressuring Congress to approve aid for Central America.
   ``The president's priorities are out of skew when he's focusing
on Nicaragua and Panama but will not use the same public media in
order to try to describe what the problems are with our own
economy,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.

   Hundreds of Muscovites gathered for the opening of
the first Soviet retail shop selling Polaroid cameras for rubles.
   Many had their picture taken and were delighted as their
portraits developed instantly.
   The cameras, assembled at a Soviet plant from Polaroid
components, will sell for $405 in rubles, a company spokesman said.
   The new shop is a joint business venture formed by Polaroid and
the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industries. Initial sales
were expected to be about 10,000 cameras in the first year,
according to a Polaroid official.
   The joint venture, called Svetozor, will generate hard currency
by manufacturing printed circuit boards used in the electronics of
the Polaroid camera and exporting them to other Polaroid plants in
the West.
   Previously, Polaroid products were only available at special
shops or foreigners and only for hard currency _ dollars or other
cash traded on the international market.

Prices also were boosted by a shortage of stock in some sectors.

   The stock market advanced broadly today, bidding

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.89 to
2,836.57 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 622 up, 341

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit jumped 38.5 percent to
$8.45 billion in March as record exports were offset by the second
highest level of imports, the government reported today.
   Despite the widened gap in March, the deficit still was below
the average $9.0 billion monthly imbalance in 1989. And many
economists say the gap, which has improved each year since peaking
in 1987, should continue to narrow this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, noting that the $23.9
billion first-quarter trade deficit was the lowest in more than six
years, said in a statement he expects the gap to total less than
$100 billion this year. It was $109 billion in 1989.
   The Commerce Department said a 4.6 percent increase in exports
in March, to $33.28 billion, was offset by a 10 percent gain in
imports, to $41.7 billion, second only to the record $41.9 billion
set last October.
   The trade deficit is the difference between what America imports
and what it sells abroad.
   The imbalance had narrowed to a revised $6.1 billion in
February, the smallest deficit in six years, and was down 34.6
percent from a $9.32 billion gap January. The February gap first
was reported to have been $6.49 billion.
   Many analysts had been expecting a deficit of about $7.8 billion
in March, up from the February level but still well below the $9
billion monthly average last year.
   The news was sure to attract attention at the White House and on
Capitol Hill, where negotiators were studying compromise spending
cuts and possible tax hikes to reduce the budget deficit.
   Trade improvements are seen as an essential part of any effort
to spur economic growth and stem the widening gap between what the
government receives and what it spends.
   The jump in exports from $31.8 billion was led by automobiles,
industrial supplies, and foods, feeds and beverages. It was pulled
down by a decline in aircraft shipments which had boosted the
February export level.
   Imports were up from $37.9 billion in February, led by
automobiles, capital goods, consumer goods and industrial supplies.
The 10 percent gain was the largest since a 21.8 percent advance in
September 1985.
   Oil imports totaled 261 million barrels, up 7.4 percent from
February. But prices fell from $19.39 a barrel to $18.18 a barrel
in March, making the $4.7 billion import bill virtually the same as
the previous month.
   As usual, the deficit with Japan was the largest of any country.
It totaled $3.6 billion; followed by China and Taiwan, $600 million
each; Mexico and Brazil, $300 million each, and Canada, $100
million. The United States posted a $700 million surplus with the
countries of Western Europe.
   The trade deficit hit $152.12 billion in 1987 and then dropped
to $118.53 billion the following year. The 1989 deficit slid
further to $109 billion.
   ``I think the deficit for '90 will show a significant
improvement over 1989,'' said senior economist Bruce Steinberg of
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``It will get down to
about $95 billion or so, maybe even better than that.''
   Economists at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago also forecast
continued improvement. They expect the average monthly gap in the
first quarter to total about $7.6 billion, down from $9.1 billion
during January-March 1989.
   ``Stepped-up export demand stemming from vibrant economic growth
abroad, plus reduced import demand caused by sluggish domestic
growth, should assure further reductions in the deficit in coming
quarters,'' they say.
   Elias Bikhazi, money market economist at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said ``softer import growth'' should
help cut the deficit to ``a bit below $100 billion'' this year.
   Oil imports, however, remain troubling. Domestic oil production
now is at a 25-year low and many analysts expect both foreign oil
shipments and prices to rise in coming months.
   The administration is counting on further trade improvements to
dampen growing protectionist pressures in Congress as well as to
bolster economic growth.
   A sluggish economy already has cut government tax receipts and,
together with high interest rates, is threatening to drive up
further the already raging federal budget deficit.
   As a result, President Bush and congressional leaders began
negotiations earlier this week on a package of spending cuts and
revenue increases to forestall the automatic spending cuts for
fiscal 1991 under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Mostly Higher On Weather, Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
talk of new export sales and prospects for a resumption of wet
weather in key growing areas.
   Soybean futures showed the greatest strength this morning after
settling mostly higher Wednesday.
   Some of this morning's buying interest was was fueled by reports
of firmer soybean meal markets in Europe and indications that
Mexico bought more than 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn overnight.
   Further support stemmed from the National Weather Service's
latest six-to-10-day outlook, issued Wednesday, which predicts
cooler- and wetter-than-normal conditions in the Midwest during the
latter half of next week.
   Heavy rains in the Midwest already have slowed corn and soybean
planting, a supportive factor in the futures markets.
   Rain also is expected to return to the Southern Plains this
weekend, posing the threat of further damage to the winter wheat
crop.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 2{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.90 a bushel;
corn futures were } cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $2.83{
a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with May at $1.53{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5{ cents higher with May at
$6.16{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork-belly futures were up sharply
following sharp gains yesterday.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
June at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with May at 84.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .15
cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 65.40 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to 1.38 cent higher with
May at 65.55 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Narrowing of Japan's Trade Surplus Resumes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The narrowing of Japan's trade surplus, interrupted
in March after an 11-month stretch, resumed in April, the Finance
Ministry announced Thursday.
   The ministry said Japan's exports exceeded its imports by $3.54
billion in April, compared with $7.29 billion a year earlier.
   In trade with the United States, the surplus shrank from $4.54
billion to $2.45 billion.
   The surplus, measured when goods pass through customs, had
expanded in March from year-earlier levels because of unusually
high imports in March 1989, just before imposition of a new 3
percent sales tax.
   The amount of the surplus' narrowing in April was exaggerated by
the particularly large surplus in April last year, when imports
fell sharply after the tax was imposed.
   The ministry said the basic trend of declining surpluses was
continuing, regardless of the distorting effects of the tax on
comparisons with 1989.
   Japan has been under pressure from the United States and other
trading partners to shrink its large surpluses.
   In various negotiations this year, Japan has agreed to open its
market wider to U.S. satellites, supercomputers and forest
products, and to boost public works spending, tighten antimonopoly
rules, reform its distribution system and combat corporate groups'
exclusionary trade practices.
   Japan's global exports in April totaled $21.87 billion, down 5.8
percent from a year earlier. Imports rose 15 percent to $18.33
billion.
   Japan's exports to the United States amounted to $6.72 billion
in April, down 14.9 percent from April 1989, while imports from the
United States increased by 26.8 percent to $4.27 billion.
   Exports of automobiles, meanwhile, dropped 19.1 percent in April
to $3.71 billion. Japanese automakers have been boosting their
production overseas.

<TEXT>
   Robert J. Stetson, Burger King Corp.'s chief
financial officer since February 1989, was named the fast-food
company's chief operating officer Thursday.
   Stetson, 39, will be responsible for the operation of the more
than 5,400 Burger King restaurants in the United States and report
to Barry J. Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive officer, the
company said.
   No one has been named to replace Stetson as CFO.
   Before joining Burger King, Stetson was a top-level executive
with Pearle Optical, which has more than 1,300 outlets. Like
Miami-based Burger King, Pearle is a subsidiary of the British
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   The economics and business-administration Harvard graduate began
his career as chief financial officer with Pepsico Food Service
International in 1972.
   He left to become president of Magna Photo of Chicago in 1982,
rejoined Pepsico as Pizza Hut senior vice president in 1986 and
later joined Pearle.
   Burger King, which has 6,000 outlets worldwide and had
systemwide sales of $5.7 billion in 1989, was acquired by Grand
Metropolitan in January 1989 when the British company bought
Pillsbury Co.

   The stock market gained ground today, bidding to
extend the rally that carried it to record highs earlier in the
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.03 to
2,831.71 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 761 up, 543 down and
546 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market benefited from lingering hopes for
lower interest rates.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds rose slightly, reducing their yields to the 8.61 percent-8.65
percent range.
   The dip in rates came in spite of news that the nation's trade
deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a 6{-year low of
$6.10 billion the month before.
   Brokers said the latest figure, though larger than expected,
didn't significantly discourage the belief that the United States

world markets.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up &rsqb; at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.22 to 194.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Pair Convicted of Insider Trading by Getting Preview of Magazine
Column</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge froze the assets of a former print
shop worker and a stock broker after their convictions on insider
trading charges for scooping tips from Business Week before the
magazine hit the newsstands.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson ordered the assets frozen
after a jury on Wednesday convicted William N. Jackson, 34, of Long
Beach and Brian Callahan, 30, of Anaheim.
   Jackson, a former quality control analyst at a printing firm,
could be fined up to $80,000 for his part in the insider trading
scheme, while Callahan, a former Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
broker, faces a maximum fine of $110,000, prosecutors said.
   The two men traded in 53 stocks between 1987 and 1988 using
information gleaned from Business Week. Jackson made more than
$19,000 for himself and two brothers, and Callahan made the same
amount for himself and his clients plus $8,000 in commissions, the
government alleged.
   Jackson reviewed a freshly printed copy of Business Week each
Wednesday night, then phoned Callahan the next morning to buy
stocks recommended in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column,
prosecutors said.
   The magazine, printed on Wednesday nights, does not reach
newsstands until Thursday evening.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would seek all
profits, plus interest, and triple that amount in penalties.
   The men's attorney, Joseph Connolly, argued the SEC was
``stretching the securities laws almost beyond recognition'' and
called the violations marginal.
   ``These are a couple of guys who lost their jobs,' he said.
``They're not wealthy, either of them.''
   Jackson acknowledged he bought stock, but testified he did not
realize he was breaking the law or confidentiality requirements of
his company, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.
   Callahan testified he believed Jackson got his tips from a
computer program.
   Neither the printing company nor Business Week were charged in
the case.

   General Motors Corp. will shut its Lakewood car
assembly plant in Atlanta Aug. 6, a GM spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Sharon Hines said 2,200 employees will be laid off when the
automaker stops making 1990 versions of the Chevrolet Caprice.
Production of the 1991 Caprice began in March at Willow Run, Mich.
   The Lakewood plant will be the fourth assembly plant GM has shut
down since 1987, when it signed its current contract with the
United Auto Workers union. The agreement allows an assembly plant
closing only when sales of its products slump.
   The other closed plants were in Leeds, Mo.; Pontiac, Mich.; and
Framingham, Mass.

   Decked out in a light blue shirt and navy
pants, Leonard Harlan, financier, was a regular member of the
fast-food crew.
   He cut fish, prepared salads, did some frying and assisted at
the front counter during a six-hour shift at a Long John Silver's
Seafood Shoppe in south Lexington.
   But it wasn't a regular work day for Harlan. As president of one
of the investment firms that took the fast-food company private
last September, Harlan was working in the trenches as part of the
company's plan for keeping in touch with the troops.
   ``I'm impressed with the way the team operates,'' said Harlan,
53, who wore a Seaman Apprentice nametag with ``Len'' printed on
it. ``It gives me an appreciation into what you do in one of these
shops.''
   Castle Harlan Inc. is one of two New York investment firms
involved in the management-led leveraged buyout of Jerrico Inc.,
the parent company of Long John Silver's. The other owner is
DJS-Inverness and Co.
   In contrast to other takeovers that have succumbed to heavy
debts, Lexington-based Jerrico has thrived since its $620 million
buyout.
   ``We take fundamentally sound companies and expand from that
base,'' said Harlan, who added that operating cash flow is up 20
percent over last year. ``Our philosophy is we build companies. We
get the energy released inside the company. We take the lid off.''
   Harlan Castle also owns Peasant Restaurants of Atlanta and
Morton's of Chicago, Ethan Allen furniture company, Delaware
Management Co., a money-management firm; and Reagan Outdoor, a
billboard company.
   Jerrico has streamlined operation, reducing costs by $16 million
in corporate administration and $14 million at the restaurants
since the buyout. It also eliminated about 200 regional and
corporate jobs.
   ``We didn't look for the quick buck,'' Jerrico president John E.
Tobe, who also worked a shift at a Long John Silver's in Atlanta.
``We had long-term planning. I think that's what made this LBO a
success.''
   LBOs work best when operations are trimmed to the best
performers and other assets are sold off to cover financing costs.
In Jerrico's case, the company recently announced agreements to
sell two restaurant chains, Jerry's to Great American Restaurants,
Inc. of Atlanta and Fazoli's to Seed Restaurant Group Inc., a
Japanese-owned firm. The prices were not disclosed.
   Jerrico also owns two family-style Italian restaurants called
Florenz, which it plans to sell.
   ``We want to focus solely on Long John Silver's,'' said Tobe,
who has been with Jerrico for 16 years, the past six as president
and chief executive officer.
   Long John Silver's has about 62 percent of the $1.2 billion
quick-service seafood restaurant business. Jerrico owns about
two-thirds of the 1,500 restaurants, and the rest are franchised.
   The chain operates in 35 states, the District of Columbia,
Canada and Singapore.
   Since the buyout, there has been an aggressive management
campaign to give Long John Silver's a more contemporary image.
   Television ads began Feb. 26 to promote the restaurants as
``Makin' a Splash'' with its seafood products.
   ``It is a theme that employed the upbeat nature of the
business,'' said Harlan. ``We are an upbeat business.''
   The restaurants are being remodeled, giving the buildings fresh
appearances with bright yellow on dark blue paint and large cupolas
with beacons to attract customers.
   ``The buildings were historically gray like (Kentucky) state
police cruisers,'' said Tobe. ``State police cruisers are gray so
they can go unnoticed. Our buildings ended up doing the same. We
want to have the units pop out at you.''
   The menu has been expanded to include baked and broiled seafood
for the health-conscious consumer and finger foods. Several items
will be introduced for a limited time this summer.
   The company also plans to increase the percentage of its
restaurants with drive-through service from the current 35 percent
to 65 percent; install large, bright menu boards and improve plates
and packaging.
   ``The company went from very traditional, very methodical to
one, overnight, of innovation,'' said Bill Mahony, executive vice
president, operations.
   Jerrico recently sold four Long John Silver's in Phoenix to
American Seafood Partners, one of its largest franchisees. The
agreement also calls for the buyer to develop 16 new franchised
units in the Phoenix area within the next three years, and another
16 in markets yet to be chosen.
   The company also is looking to add 200 franchised units within
five years in established markets and expand into the Northeast and
Northwest, where it has almost no presence, Tobe said.
   ``We're aggressively going after new franchisees,'' he said.
``We also hope company employees can become franchisees.''
   The company recently offered stock appreciation rights to 3,000
employees, starting with assistant managers, which will let them
benefit from the appreciation of the value of Jerrico's stock, now
held by senior managers and investors in the buyout.
   ``The company is theirs,'' said Harlan. ``We want an
entrepreneurial spirit. We want to produce independent thought.''
   In 1989, before the buyout, Jerrico had a different focus in
remembering the 20th year of Long John Silver's.
   ``On the 20th anniversary, we celebrated our age,'' said Anthony
M. Lavely, executive vice president for marketing. ``Now, eight
months later, we're celebrating our future, our youth and our
desire to do new things.''

<HEAD>PacifiCorp Raises Offer For Pinnacle West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PacifiCorp, the Portland, Ore.-based utility
giant, today increased to $1.82 billion its offer to acquire
Arizona's largest utility, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
   PacificCorp also agreed to assume all of the debt of Pinnacle
West and its subsidiary Arizona Public Service Co. as part of the
offer.
   Steve Carr, a Pinnacle West spokesman, said the company's board
of directors would ``seriously consider'' the offer.
   Pinnacle West's board rejected three previous offers from
PacifiCorp.The last offer, worth about $1.7 billion, was rejected
in March as inadequate.
   Under the new offer, Pinnacle West shareholders would received
$21 in cash for each share of stock they hold at the time of the
acquisition. Pinnacle West stock sold for $12.75 at the close of
trading Wednesday.
   ``We think it is time to bring to a conclusion PacifiCorp's
expressions of interest to you ...,'' PacifiCorp President and
Chief Executive Officer A.M. Gleason said in a letter delivered
Thursday to Richard Snell, chairman of Pinnacle West.
   ``Our offer remains the same with regard to customers of Arizona
Public Service: Rate increases limited to 2 percent per year for
four years.
   ``This is significantly less than the rate relief requested in
APS's most recent filing with the Arizona Corporation Commission:
Rate increases of 6.5 percent per year for three years.''
   PacifiCorp has said it wants the Arizona utility so that it
could conduct seasonal transfers of excess power between Arizona,
where power use peaks in the summer, and the Pacific Northwest,
where power use peaks in the winter.
   Gleason said the deal would delay into the next decade any need
for PacifiCorp to build additional power plants to meet peak
demands.
   PacifiCorp has electric utility operations in seven Western
states.
   Prior to receiving the offer Snell was not enthusiastic about a
deal.
   ``If there's another offer, we'll take a look at it,'' Snell
said. ``But our position is that this is not a good time to sell,
and the company is not for sale.
   ``On the other hand, we've given serious consideration to the
other offers, and we will again if one comes our way.''

<HEAD>London Shares Finish at Highest Levels Since November 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on London's stock exchange closed
sharply higher across the board in active trading Thursday as a
variety of influences sent them rocketing to post their biggest
daily gains since November 1987.
   ``It's very impressive, to say the least,'' said Tony Rebello,
chief dealer for the London brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up
63.3 points, or 2.85 percent, at 2,284.4, its high for the day.
That figure was well above the low of 2,227.7, posted when official
trading began.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed up 55.9
points at 1,795.7. The Financial Times 500 index closed up 31.01 at
1,229.85.
   Volume was 645.4 million shares, the healthiest showing in
months and markedly better than the 460.4 million shares that
changed hands Wednesday.
   In the futures market, the June Financial Times 100 index
contract closed at 2,329.0, up from 2,258.0 a day ago.
   Strength in stock-index futures contracts and unconfirmed rumors
early in the session that Britain could join the European Monetary
System's exchange-rate mechanism as early as this weekend sent
prices soaring.
   The market ``really never looked back'' from the opening,
Rebello said.
   Dealers said strong buying to cover short positions buoyed the
market, and some institutional investors jumped on the bandwagon
amid a shortage of stock, committing to fresh positions so they
wouldn't miss out on the rally.
   ``People sitting on the sidelines decided that they at least
better get their toes wet,'' Rebello said.
   Also, British traders said strength on Wall Street, sustained
throughout the London session, provided a good backbone of support
for movement on the 100-share index. Most agreed that fluctuations
in the key Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street will
determine the fate of the market in London in the short term.
   ``If Wall Street goes higher, I think the bull will prevail,''
Rebello said. Conversely, he added, if the Dow average eases, it
will most likely drag the 100-share index with it as investors
realize that Britain's gloomy economic situation has not
fundamentally changed.
   Although a slew of British economic data were released during
the session, the market largely ignored them and payed virtually no
attention to U.S. trade data that showed a wider-than-expected
trade gap for March.
   Among British indicators, the public sector borrowing
requirement, or budget deficit, came in at 2.12 billion pounds for
April, higher than market forecasts of 1.25 billion pounds.
Unemployment was unchanged in April from the month before at a
seasonally adjusted 5.6 percent of the work force.

   Most of the gains came early in the session, encouraged by a
brief drop in open-market interest rates.
   As the session passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on
long-term government bonds climbed to the 8.65 percent-8.69 percent
range.
   In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a
6{-year low of $6.10 billion the month before.

   Volume was 645.4 million shares, the healthiest showing in
months and markedly better than the 460.4 million shares that
changed hands Wednesday.
   In the futures market, the June Financial Times 100 index
contract closed at 2,329.0, up from 2,258.0 a day ago.
   Strength in stock-index futures contracts and unconfirmed rumors
early in the session that Britain could join the European Monetary
System's exchange-rate mechanism as early as this weekend sent
prices soaring.
   The market ``really never looked back'' from the opening,
Rebello said.
   Dealers said strong buying to cover short positions buoyed the
market, and some institutional investors jumped on the bandwagon
amid a shortage of stock, committing to fresh positions so they
wouldn't miss out on the rally.
   ``People sitting on the sidelines decided that they at least
better get their toes wet,'' Rebello said.
   Also, British traders said strength on Wall Street, sustained
throughout the London session, provided a good backbone of support
for movement on the 100-share index. Most agreed that fluctuations
in the key Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street will
determine the fate of the market in London in the short term.
   ``If Wall Street goes higher, I think the bull will prevail,''
Rebello said. Conversely, he added, if the Dow average eases, it
will most likely drag the 100-share index with it as investors
realize that Britain's gloomy economic situation has not
fundamentally changed.
   Although a slew of British economic data were released during
the session, the market largely ignored them and payed virtually no
attention to U.S. trade data that showed a wider-than-expected
trade gap for March.
   Among British indicators, the public sector borrowing
requirement, or budget deficit, came in at 2.12 billion pounds for
April, higher than market forecasts of 1.25 billion pounds.
Unemployment was unchanged in April from the month before at a
seasonally adjusted 5.6 percent of the work force.

<HEAD>Iacocca Urges Shareholders To Take Long View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca pleaded with stockholders today to stick with the automaker
despite falling profits and stock price, saying it is poised to
take on Japanese and American competitors in the 1990s.
   Iacocca, addressing the company's annual meeting, acknowledged
that earnings have been very disappointing, but counseled them to
take a long view. He noted that the yearly dividend of $1.20 per
share was about a 7 percent yield at the stock price of about $17
today.
   ``Barring a disaster, maybe a nuclear disaster, we don't
anticipate cutting your dividends,'' the flamboyant Chrysler leader
said.
   Iacocca also was in Los Angeles to concludeda six-city
promotional tour linked to an aggressive advertising campaign
touting Chrysler quality. He reiterated his claims that the quality
of Chrysler cars now equals Japanese models and that they are the
safest on the road.
   Now, he said, the task is convincing Americans of that, and
``we're going to get better.''
   He said the whole industry has suffered of late, Chrysler
included, from over-capacity and economic declines at the beginning
and end of the 1980s.
   ``You might say this is starting to look a lot like the Chrysler
of the 1980s _ a Chrysler in trouble,'' Iacocca said.
   However, he said, Chrysler today has far less debt, more than 10
times the cash on hand, can borrow $2.6 billion without asking
Washington for help as it did in 1980, and has 13.3 percent of the
U.S. car and truck market compared with 10.3 percent in 1980.
   He said that after 44 years in the industry he was convinced it
would make more sense to report sales results every 10 years rather
than every 10 days because planning is done that far in advance.
   He said he realized, of course, that shareholders would not
allow him to do that.
   But, he said, ``taking the long view is the only way to keep
your sanity in this business.''
   He also denied that his latest ad campaign constituted
Japan-bashing, saying he never said a word against the Japanese
people or the high-quality products they produce, but only against
their trade practices and the U.S. government for allowing them.
   ``One thing we've learned is that the competition will not
necessarily be a fair competition,'' Iacocca said.

<HEAD>The Tax Impact of Putting Bart to Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Homer Simpson sent underachieving son Bart
out to get a job this summer, he might keep the punk out of his
hair for a couple of months but Bart could get an unexpected bill
from Uncle Sam.
   Mowing lawns or peddling papers isn't the cartoon Bart's idea of
fun, but it's a way of life for millions of real-life youngsters
who try to make some money when school is out.
   The earning power of summer job-holders can have an impact on
family tax returns. Probably not too much, tax experts say,
although mom and pop could face additional IRS forms and extra
confusion.
   Jobholders over age 14 may have to pay taxes, or at least file
returns, depending upon how much money they earn.
   The so-called ``kiddie tax'' _ an offspring of the 1986 tax
reform laws _ presents a problem for those under 14. That tax is
applied to unearned, or passive income, such as dividends or
interest on savings accounts.
   All children pay no taxes on the first $500 of passive earnings,
and the next $500 is taxed at the child's own rate, usually 15
percent. But for those under age 14, unearned income over $1,000 is
taxed at the parent's top rate, usually 28 percent to 33 percent.
   The purpose of this rule is to curtail the popular practice of
shifting income to children and other dependents to reduce taxes.
   Many young dependents aged 14 or older likely won't have to have
any state or federal taxes deducted from their paychecks, provided
their total annual earnings remain under the standard deduction of
$3,250, experts say. They will, however, have to file returns or be
included in their parents' returns if they have both passive and
earned income.
   ``For the youngster who starts a summer job and has no passive
income the operative number is $3,250,'' said Frank Keith, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service.
   Even more income could be sheltered for a child if he qualifies
to take a personal exemption, which is $2,050 for 1990. But parents
couldn't also claim the child as a dependent on their return, and
in order to qualify, the child must prove he provides more than
half his total support, experts say.
   Regardless of their earnings, youngsters still have to pay the
7.65 percent Social Security tax.
   Staying below the standard deduction shouldn't be much of a
problem for most children job-holders. Someone working 20 hours a
week at minimum wage during July and August could only expect to
gross about $685. Before they'd have to start worrying about taxes,
they would have to be making around $7 an hour, 40 hours a week for
the entire summer.
   It's a different story for children under 14. Although these
youngsters are barred from most jobs, with a few exception such as
certain farm work or paper routes, the kiddie tax could penalize an
especially enterprising youth.
   Vincent Vaccaro, a tax partner at the accounting firm Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, said the standard deduction on earned income could be
reduced if a child under 14 also has passive income.
   He gives the following example: A 13-year-old old makes $3,000 a
year from a paper route, plus has $1,000 in unearned income. The
first $500 in unearned income would be exempt from taxes but that
also would reduce the youngster's standard deduction by the same
amount, to $2,750, making him liable for taxes on his earned income.
   ``It can be very cumbersome for families. It's a clear case of
overkill,'' said Judy Walsh, director of executive financial
counseling for the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche. ``It's a
complicated system ... for something very simple, like children
trying to earn money for college.''
   Vaccaro agreed, saying the kiddie tax has ``made it a lot more
fun'' for accountants.

<HEAD>Philip Morris To Acquire East German Cigarette Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German subsidiary of Philip Morris
Cos. has agreed to acquire the East German cigarette manufacturer
VEB Kombinat Tabak, it was announced Thursday. Terms were not
disclosed.
   The proposed acquisition between VEB Kombinat Tabak and Philip
Morris GmbH will allow the New York-based food and tobacco giant to
expand further in Eastern Europe, where trade barriers have been
broken down recently following the move away from communism.
   George Knox, a spokesman for Philip Morris in New York, said the
two companies have signed a letter of intent to merge, and the deal
is expected to close at the end of June.
   ``It's a good strategic move for us in the market, but it's
fairly small,'' he said.
   Knox said Philip Morris sells about 6 billion cigarettes in
Eastern Europe a year. VEB Kombinat Tabak produces about 10 billion
cigarettes in East Germany annually under the brand names F-6, Karo
and Juwel, he said.
   According to the official East German news agency ADN, the
proposed takeover was approved by a majority of the Dresden-based
company's employees.
   Philip Morris promised there would be no layoffs through 1992,
the news agency said. It also promised to raise the workers' gross
salaries by about $90 a month and apply the more generous West
German benefits, it said.
   Sales and marketing will be directed by Philip Morris' West
German headquarters in Munich, while sales offices will be set up
in Berlin and Dresden, ADN said.
   The Dresden plant, which employs about 1,000 workers, will
produce brands made by Philip Morris GmbH as well as its own
brands, ADN said.
   ADN said experts were studying what investments were needed to
modernize production in the Dresden plant and raise the quality of
the cigarettes.

   Wearing pastel tennis shirts and moccasins
without socks, John A. Mulheren Jr. cuts an odd figure in federal
court, where he is on trial for securities fraud.
   During a lull in jury selection, Mulheren playfully grabbed an
open microphone and sang. When the judge asked prospective jurors
if a six-week trial would pose problems, Mulheren joined a dozen
who raised hands.
   Mulheren's irreverence in the face of prison is consistent with
an iconoclastic image earned as one of the most aggressive and
successful speculators of the 1980s.
   The 6-foot-2 Wall Streeter trained to ride the luge in the
Winter Olympics, palled around with Bruce Springsteen, wore chinos
as a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Wunderkind, once brought a roller-skating
chimp to work as a gag, rode a helicopter to work and executed
daring trades that awed his peers.
   He also is a diagnosed manic depressive who allegedly schemed to
shoot Ivan Boesky after learning his former friend sought to
implicate him in market cheating.
   ``He's a very colorful, unusual, talented guy somewhere between
charming and crazy,'' said a Wall Street executive for whom
Mulheren managed capital in the mid-1980s.
   Mulheren, 40, looks like a happy bulldog. That's the way friends
describe him, volatile yet gentle, known for mood swings incited by
his medical condition, an abrupt hot-to-cold that in some ways
mirrors Wall Street itself.
   He reaped millions in gambles with other people's money and his
own that flouted conventional wisdom. He threw lavish parties at
the Rumson, N.J., mansion where he lives with his wife and five
adopted children.
   It came apart in February 1988 when Mulheren was arrested toting
an assault rifle and Army fatigues. Police said he was en route to
get Boesky, the speculator who named names for leniency in settling
insider trading charges.
   Last June, Mulheren was charged with manipulating Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. stock and concealing ownership of large blocks of shares in
concert with Boesky. His trial began last week in Manhattan federal
court. Mulheren faces five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine
on each of 41 counts.
   ``He had a reputation as a very savvy trader,'' said Robert
Seijas, a New York Stock Exchange market-maker. ``The respect for
his ability was practically universal. Whatever else he did, that
was true.''
   Mulheren arrived on Wall Street in the early 1970s from Roanoke
College in Virginia as an assistant trader at G.A. Saxton, a
now-defunct brokerage. He was hired by former Treasury Secretary
Donald T. Regan at Merrill Lynch while in his mid-20s and ran the
risk arbitrage department, where traders bet enormous sums on
potentially hot stocks.
   His casual dress rankled superiors, particularly as young
Mulheren made a personal fortune and generated $99 million for
Merrill in three years, associates say. Confronted about his
attire, Mulheren told executives, ``I can wear a coat and tie or I
can make money.'' The khakis stayed.
   ``He was 26 and looked upon by Don Regan as the most valuable
human asset in that firm. It's kind of remarkable,'' said Mulheren
acquaintance Michael Aronstein, president of the New York
investment firm Comstock Partners.
   Mulheren later left Merrill to open Mulheren &amp; Co., which
folded, partly because he was a careless manager.
   ``He can't handle the administrative stuff or any of the
nonsense that goes along,'' Aronstein said. ``He's not going to
score 46 points in the game and then clean up the concession stand.
Unfortunately, in this business, when you're running a business,
somebody's got to clean up.''
   Mulheren later traded stocks for the Wall Street firm Spear,
Leeds &amp; Kellogg. Friends said he left in 1984 to be with his family
after one of his children nearly drowned in the backyard pool while
Mulheren was preoccupied with a business call.
   About six months later, Mulheren founded Jamie Securities. It
became one of the most powerful traders in takeover stocks.
   In a move typical of his style, Mulheren would dump stock to
send it down then repurchase at the lower price. Friends recall
complex trading strategies that required vast market knowledge.
   ``He was a guy who would initiate market moves by thundering in
and thundering out,'' said a top speculator who knew Mulheren,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He would often fake left and
move right.''
   Mulheren's skill was matched by eccentricity. His antics at
Merrill Lynch ranged from inviting Dixieland bands onto the trading
floor to renting a live chimp on roller skates named ``Mr. Zip.''
   He kept a large portrait of John Belushi by his Merrill desk. A
large stuffed toy bear sat by his desk at Jamie, where he also
installed a Nautilus machine. He'd take breaks to work out.
   ``John is his own person. He doesn't make excuses or explain
himself to anybody,'' said Mulheren friend Charlie Sweeney, a
Merrill senior vice president. He said Mulheren's trading ability
shone through ``whether he dressed in a blue jumpsuit or a beanie
with a propeller on top.''
   Mulheren snubbed golf and tennis, drawn instead to sports that
matched his love of risk. Hoping to qualify for luge racing at the
1988 Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, he hired a German trainer,
bought the best gear and zoomed down the ice at Lake Placid, N.Y.
   ``He wanted to bring the fun back into the Olympics. He tried to
bring fun back onto the trading desk on Wall Street too,'' said
friend Charles Minter, a partner in Comstock Partners.
   Known for generosity, Mulheren hosted huge parties and
children's competitions at his riverfront home. He once ordered a
hail of pingpong balls to fall from the sky. He threw a ``This Is
Your Life'' party for wife Nancy.
   Boesky was Mulheren's Achilles heel. They were so close Boesky
made him a family trustee. When Boesky's firm faced a jam in 1982,
Mulheren helped bail him out. They talked almost daily.
   In 1986, Mulheren had no hint of Boesky's impending fall.
Mulheren subsequently cooperated with regulators but became
increasingly frazzled when it appeared he would be indicted.
   In early 1988 Mulheren stopped taking lithium prescribed for his
depression. On Feb. 18, he loaded some of his weapons collection
into his Mercedes. His wife called police, who stopped him in the
driveway. They said Mulheren planned to kill Boesky and Boesky's
chief trader, Michael Davidoff.
   Two months later, Jamie Securities folded because of Mulheren's
legal problems. Weapons charges in New Jersey later were dropped
and Mulheren was placed on probation.
   He recently returned to Wall Street as a partner in another
firm, J&amp;B Specialists. Friends praise him for going to trial,
unlike other Wall Street figures who have copped guilty pleas.
   ``He's got that trader's mentality _ he sees a good trade
here,'' Sweeney said. ``Dollars and cents, I'd think he'd be
smarter settling, but it's not a matter of dollars and cents. He
wants to be completely exonerated.''
   Boesky is the main prosecution witness.
   ``I wish he had never made any contact with Ivan Boesky,''
Minter said. ``But you can't go back. I just hope the evidence
presented will exonerate him.''

<HEAD>Space Center Gives Houston Economy Basis For Future</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center has poured
billions of dollars into the Houston area since 1962 but its true
economic value has only recently been recognized, and now the
center is viewed as a key to prosperity.
   Stripped of 225,000 jobs when the energy industry collapsed, the
nation's fourth biggest metropolitan area suddenly found itself
without an economic anchor and sought another. What it found in
part was aerospace, most of it connected somehow to the space
center 25 miles southeast of town.
   ``We frankly have never really focused on it until five or six
years ago,'' said John Brock, president of economic development for
the Greater Houston Partnership.
   The space center has pumped almost $40 billion directly into
Houston, and even with a reduced space program, the center spends
about $3.7 million each working day.
   ``The impact might be 10 _ maybe even 20-fold _ on the general
economy in Houston,'' Brock said.
   Economist Robert Hodgin of the University of Houston-Clear Lake,
said the space center, while an important contributor to the
region's economy, provided only a piece of the recovery.
   ``What it did do, however, was to serve as ray of optimism,
served as a magnet for other endeavors and served as a PR (public
relations) tool for city leaders,'' Hodgin said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration officially
opened the facility on 1,620 acres of donated land in 1963 as the
Manned Spacecraft Center, directing the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab,
space shuttle and other programs. It was renamed in 1973 to honor
Johnson, who as vice president had a lot to do with its location in
Houston.
   The space center has served as both an employer of thousands:
there are 3,250 federal employees on the payroll, plus another
9,650 contractor personnel work at the center or support its
operations. The center also spent $16.1 million last fiscal year on
public utilities.
   Besides the basic operations, however, Brock said the center has
been a draw to other aerospace companies such as Grumman Corp. and
McDonnell-Douglas Corp., both of which have major aerospace
operations nearby.
   Grumman came to Houston in the early 1970s to build the lunar
module for the Apollo program, but in 1986 brought in its civil
space operations because ``Houston was still in the woes of the oil
and real estate slump, so that made it very, very favorable for
business coming in,'' said Grumman spokeswoman Miriam Reed.
   Plus, ``there's a terrific local labor force. Because of NASA
and the universities, there are lots of high-tech people there in
terms of engineering and technical personnel.''
   The slump, NASA and labor benefits helped Houston beat out
metropolitan Washington, southern California and Colorado for the
facility, Ms. Reed said.
   Grumman had hoped to land the main contract for the Freedom
space station, but stayed in Houston when it failed, and now is a
subcontractor on the project, working on the crew quarters and a
``space tug.''
   McDonnell-Douglas also set up shop in Houston a few years to
supply parts for the Freedom space station.
   Brock said Houston is hoping to land an aircraft maintenance
base being planned by Continental Airlines Inc.
   Houston also is home to Space Services Inc., which earlier this
month sent its second commercially launched rocket into space and
plans to launch 12 more this year. SSI is headed by Donald K.
``Deke'' Slayton, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts.
   ``The Fortune 500 20 years from now is going to have a number of
companies that do business in space,'' said Art Dula, a
self-described ``space lawyer'' who has helped incorporate several
space-related businesses including SSI.
   ``Houston, since it has a very strong energy industry _ which is
high-tech and R&amp;D (research and development) oriented _ has the
kind of technical expertise'' to be home to those companies, some
of which have yet to be founded, he said.
   While the oil collapse pitched many workers out of a job, Brock
and Dula said their skills _ from sheet metal working to computer
programming _ easily can be used in the aerospace industry.
   ``And as a result, we are trying to take the Johnson Space
Center and the activities based there and let that whole industry
blossom,'' he said.
   NASA pitched in three years ago as it helped establish a program
called Partners In Space to aid companies in learning how to do
business with the space agency and benefit from its presence.
   ``Partners ... believe that the center must be integrated into
the business, educational, research and technology goal of the
state,'' states a Partners publication. ``As such, Partners work in
their respective communities to ensure that America's space
program, and especially the portion that could come to Texas,
enjoys broad support.''
   Houston's plans could be undermined, however, by problems with
Texas's educational system.
   At a recent symposium sponsored by Partners in Space, every
speaker worried about those shortcomings.
   ``Space travel and technology ... is a highly sophisticated
business,'' said Thomas M. Stauffer, president of the University of
Houston-Clear Lake. ``It requires, indeed demands, a significant
fraction of the nation's technical manpower in order for the space
shuttle to fulfill its mission.
   ``With the upcoming space station project, moon and Mars
missions, that fraction will grow,'' he said. ``The perfect U.S.
space program is dependent upon a steady supply of highly educated
individuals.''
   But Stauffer and others said the Texas schools are not producing
enough of those individuals. Arguments over court-ordered education
funding show ``education leadership does not appear to be high on
the agenda in Austin,'' the state capital, he said.
   While recruiters have focused on aerospace, Daniel Nebrig, an
associate director of the center, says future space explorations
mean more than just a one-industry impact.
   Projects such as the space shuttle and the space station require
specialized knowledge best found at NASA, Nebrig said.
   But to figure out how to live on the Moon, or mine Mars, Nebrig
said, ``We need new technology. ... We need people who are used to
making concrete, mining, agriculture.''
   ``Houston plays into that hand very well,'' Brock said.
``Somewhere we will be involved with, if not space exploration,
then space engineering as it continues to advance.''

   The stock market nudged ahead today, bidding to
extend the rally that carried it to record highs earlier in the
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 8.79 to 2,828.47
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 783 up, 645 down and
516 unchanged.
   Most of the gains came early in the session, encouraged by a
brief drop in open-market interest rates.
   As the session passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on
long-term government bonds climbed to the 8.65 percent-8.69 percent
range.
   In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a
6{-year low of $6.10 billion the month before.
   Brokers said the latest figure, though larger than expected,
didn't significantly discourage the belief that the United States
has been gradually improving its competitive position of late in
world markets.
   Hewlett-Packard fell ~ to 45\ in active trading on top of a

<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies reported
Thursday that net income dropped 40 percent in the first quarter of
1990, reflecting a weak performance by its chemical group and a
one-time gain from property sales a year ago.
   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant, based in The Hague, Netherland, said
its net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $1.35
billion, compared with $2.16 billion in 1989. The company does not
report consolidated per-share earnings.
   Sales totaled $29.12 billion, up from $25.02 billion.
   The company's financial statements are based on British
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared to those of most

typical American system of last in first out (LIFO), or on a
current cost basis.
   Shell said higher crude oil prices, increased oil production and
improved gas sales bolstered exploration and production earnings.
   But it also noted that net income for 1989 was buoyed by a
$412.4 million gain from property sales.
   Shell said its chemicals business was weak during the latest
first quarter, mainly from ``sharply lower prices for commodity
petrochemicals.'' Refining and marketing profits also declined,
with U.S. operations showing a slight loss for the quarter, it said.
   In the United States, chemicals sales declined and several
plants were damaged by extremely cold weather, Shell said.
   ``Demand for chemicals remains strong and plant capacity
utilization high, although petrochemical margins are likely to
continue to be well down from the high levels experienced in late
1988 and early 1989,'' the company said.
   Shell also said it had higher tax and interest charges, as well
as adverse currency movement during the first quarter of 1990.
   Royal-Dutch Shell is the world's second largest oil company
behind Exxon Corp.

<HEAD>Eight Saatchi Account Directors Leave To Form New Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi and Saatchi, the troubled British
advertising giant, said Thursday that eight account directors at
its London agency have resigned to form an independent company.
   The departure of the directors, who worked at Saatchi and
Saatchi Advertising Ltd., was unrelated to a recent management
shakeup and decline in the parent's financial performance, a
spokesman for the company said.
   The spokesman said the directors are among about 100 at the
agency and dismissed suggestions it represented a major defection.
   ``It's part and parcel of having a people business,'' he said.
``People come and go.''
   The departures follow unconfirmed speculation of a possible
sell-off of Saatchi's core advertising businesses and the
resignations earlier this month of directors Roy Warman and Terry
Bannister, formerly joint chief operating officers of Saatchi's
core communications division.
   Paul Cowan, one of the directors who resigned, told the Evening
Standard newspaper that Saatchi and Saatchi had changed from being
a young, dynamic agency to a multinational conglomerate.
   ``We are the keepers of the agency's creative flame,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``We hope to recreate the thriving agency culture
which Saatchis used to have.''
   In the year ended September 1989, the company reported a 48
percent drop in pretax profit to 61.3 million pounds, or about
$103.6 million, from 117.0 million pounds, or $197.8 million, in
1988.
   Saatchi last year named former IMS International Inc. chief
executive Robert Louis-Dreyfuss as chief executive of the company
in hopes of redeeming losses relating to the purchase of consulting
businesses, bought for about 250 million pounds, or $422.6 million,
mostly in 1986.
   Louis-Dreyfuss' appointment followed considerable speculation
over a possible breakup or buyout of the company. Carl Spielvogel,
head of Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., Saatchi's unit in the
United States, last year was rebuffed in an attempt to launch a
management buyout.

   The stock market pushed ahead to new highs
today, resuming its recent rally.
   Most of the gains came early in the session, encouraged by a
brief drop in open-market interest rates.
   As the day passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on
long-term government bonds climbed to the 8.65 percent-8.69 percent
range.
   In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a
6{-year low of $6.10 billion the month before.
   Brokers said the latest figure, though larger than expected,
didn't significantly discourage the belief that the United States
has been gradually improving its competitive position of late in
world markets.

   The energy futures market closed narrowly mixed
Thursday in lackluster trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 16
cents to settle at $18.87 a 42-gallon barrel, after losing 56 cents
Wednesday.
   Other contract months, however, gained as much as 10 cents a
barrel.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Inc., said
a Department of Energy announcement confirming earlier reports of a
sharp rise in crude stocks put selling pressure on the near-term
crude contract. The June contract expires Tuesday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.04 cent to
settle at 64.21 cents a gallon. The contract gained 0.66 cent
Wednesday.
   Although there was no significant movement in unleaded gas
contracts, Lebow noted that traders will be watching gas futures
carefully as Memorial Day approaches and kicks off the summer
driving season.
   ``We'll see if buying in preparation for the holidays is enough
to lift gas out'' of the current narrow price level, he said.
   June wholesale heating oil, which declined 0.09 cent on
Wednesday, gained 0.33 cent to settle at 51.96 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas for June delivery was unchanged at $1.570 per 1,000
cubic feet.

   The dollar ended firmer Thursday against all key
currencies except the British pound and Canadian dollar, even
though the government reported the U.S. trade deficit widened
sharply in March.
   Gold prices rose slightly after declining overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $369.50 a troy ounce, up 50 cents from late
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $369.10 an ounce, up 5 cents.
   Dealers and analysts said the currency market generally shrugged
off Thursday's Commerce Department report, which showed the trade
shortfall totaled a wider-than-expected $8.45 billion in March, up
from a revised $6.1 billion gap in February.
   ``The trade number wasn't that far out of expectations to be a
big enough deal,'' said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co. ``We're not talking about anything that
shocking.''
   Sloane said technical factors helped push up the dollar.
   Traders said the bigger spotlight in foreign exchange Thursday
was on the British pound.
   Sterling was boosted by speculation that Britain would soon be
joining the European Monetary System, said Robert Ryan, corporate
foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major indicated in an interview
with the European Wall Street Journal that government opposition to
Britain's participation in the EMS had softened considerably.
Market speculation is that British entry into the system could be
announced as early as this week, traders said.
   In London, sterling traded at $1.6905, up from $1.6805
Wednesday. It rose in New York to $1.6920 from $1.6805.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.6498 West German marks, up from
1.6450; 1.4045 Swiss francs, up from 1.4005; 5.5570 French francs,
up from 5.5460; 1,212.50 Italian lire, up from 1,210.00; and
1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17505.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6474 West German marks, up from 1.6431; 1.4049 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3990; 5.5510 French francs, up from 5.5410;
1.8430 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8505; 1210.50 Italian lire, up
from 1208.50; and 1.1738 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1756.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed
at 152.00 yen, up from 151.95 yen Wednesday. It traded at 151.90
yen in London, and at 152.15 yen in New York, up from 151.665 yen
Wednesdsay.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $369.25 an ounce from
$370 Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $369 an ounce from $369.85.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold declined 85 cents to close at a bid
$369.15 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.026 a troy ounce, up from $5.010
Wednesday. Silver closed in London at $5.05 an ounce, unchanged.

   Assets of the nation's 507 money market mutual
funds fell $1.78 billion in the latest week to $381.71 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday marked the
eighth straight weekly drop in fund assets, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said. The previous weekly drop was $2.22
billion.
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 245
general purpose funds fell $640.3 million to $131.53 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.41 billion to $158.43
billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds rose $270.1 million
to $91.75 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.70 percent from 7.66 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.22 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.23 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.05 percent from 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.99
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.01
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.17 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.18 percent; 8.20 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and
8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.24 percent.

<HEAD>May Earnings Rise 27 Percent in First Quarter; Gap Income Up 40
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. said Thursday its first-quarter
earnings rose 27 percent, while specialty apparel retailer Gap Inc.
reported its income rose 40 percent during the period.
   May, based in St. Louis, said it earned $80 million, or 58 cents
a share, in the quarter ended May 5, up from $63 million, or 45
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 10 percent to $2.19 billion from $1.98 billion in the
first quarter of 1989.
   May operates 14 department store chains, including Lord &amp;
Taylor, Foley's and Filene's, along with its Volume and Payless
shoe store chains. The company expects to spin off its Venture
discount stores later this year.
   During the first quarter, May opened nine new department stores:
two Lord &amp; Taylor stores, five Hecht's stores, one Kaufmann's store
and one G. Fox store. The company plans to open 14 more department
stores this year.
   Meanwhile, Gap said it earned $21.2 million, or 60 cents a
share, up from $15.1 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales totaled $402.4 million, up from $309.9
million.
   San Francisco-based Gap said it chalked up the gain despite
higher promotional activity, or price markdowns, that brought in
sales but put some pressure on profit margins.
   Company Chairman Donald Fisher said heavier markdowns also are
being taken in the second quarter, but said this has been typical
of Gap's performance in previous years.
   Gap operates 998 stores, including its Banana Republic chain.

   The chairman of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., S.
Parker Gilbert, will retire from the investment firm at the end of
the year, the company announced Thursday.
   Gilbert, 56, said in a statement he had recommended to the
Morgan Stanley board that company president Richard B. Fisher
succeed him, and that vice chairman Robert F. Greenhill become
president.
   Gilbert, who has been with Morgan Stanley for 30 years, will
remain a director of the company and chairman of its advisory
board, the statement said.
   Peter Roche, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said in a telephone
interview that Gilbert was retiring to pursue outside personal
interests, but also would maintain close ties to the investment
firm.
   Fisher, 53, has been Morgan Stanley's president since 1984, and
before that was head of its capital markets division. He joined
Morgan Stanley in 1962 and became a managing director in 1970.
   Greenhill, also 53, directs Morgan Stanley's investment banking
division. He also joined the company in 1962 and became a managing
director in 1970. Greenhill was elected vice chairman last year.

   The stock market climbed to another record high
Thursday, resuming its recent rally after a brief pause on
Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had slipped 2.77
on Wednesday, rose 12.03 points to 2,831.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
832 up, 649 down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.77 million
shares, against 159.81 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 201.75 million shares.
   Most of the gains in stock prices came early in the session,
encouraged by a brief drop in open-market interest rates.
   As the day passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on
long-term government bonds climbed to the 8.65 percent-8.69 percent

   In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Surge On South African Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices rose sharply Thursday amid reports of
increased racial violence in South Africa, the world's largest
platinum-producing country.
   On other commodity markets, gold and silver futures also
advanced; copper futures were mixed; pork futures rose to the daily
limit for the second straight day; soybeans rebounded from recent
losses; and energy futures were mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $5.30 to $5.40 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at
$492.90 a troy ounce.
   The rally was based largely on news that South Africa's bigest
mining company shut part of a gold mine Thursday following a racial
clash that left two whites dead and several blacks injured.
   The victims were among 12 people killed in five separate
incidents Wednesday in South Africa, which last year produced about
77 percent of the platinum supplied to non-socialist countries.
   The mining-related violence occurred at an Anglo-American Corp.
gold mine, not a platinum mine. But because South Africa plays a
key role in the delicately balanced platinum market, any sign of
escalating racial tension makes traders nervous.
   ``If the situation in South Africa were to reach dangerous
levels where they would have to close a few of those platinum
mines, you could see a strong rally develop,'' said Petr Cardillo,
a commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Analyst Bette Ratopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said the platinum market has been trying to rally lately but has
been reigned in by indications of gold selling by the Soviet Union.
The gold market tends to set the pace for the other precious metals.
   But she said there were no signs of Soviet gold sales Thursday,
leaving platinum free to respond to its own fundamentals.
   Gold futures settled 30 cents to 60 cents higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with June at $370.60 a troy ounce; silver was
1.5 cents to 1.6 cents higher with May at $5.026 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures finished narrowly mixed on the Commodity Exchange
despite the threat of another strike next week at three Southern
Peru Copper Co. mines where workers returned to work just two weeks
ago after a seven-week walkout.
   Analysts said traders were focusing on the sluggish U.S. economy
and expectations of a corresponding decline in copper consumption.
   Copper futures ended .50 cent lower to .50 cent higher with May
at $1.212 a pound.
   Pork-belly futures rose the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the second straight
day in reaction to an exchange report on Tuesday showing an
unexpected drop in frozen belly supplies.
   Cattle futures settled narrowly mixed in Chicago ahead of the
Agriculture Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report covering the
seven largest cattle states.
   The report showed a slightly smaller number of feedlot cattle as
of May 1 than traders had expected, mainly due to an unexpectedly
small number of feedlot placements last month.
   Live cattle futures settled .22 cent lower to .12 cent higher
with June at 74.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .07 cent higher with May at 84.82 cents a pound; hog futures
settled .20 cent lower to 1.10 cents higher with June at 66.10
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to 2 cents
higher with May at 66.22 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly on the Chicago Board of
Trade, rebounding from recent steep losses amid signs of stronger
demand and increasing concern about rain-delayed planting. Corn
futures also closed higher while wheat and oats were narrowly mixed.
   Wheat futures settled } cent lower to { cent higher with May at
$3.89{ a bushel; corn futures were 1 cent to 4\ cents higher with
May at $2.86} a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with May at $1.54{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9{ cents
higher with May at $6.17 a bushel.
   Oil futures finished narrowly mixed in lackluster trading on the
New York Merc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents lower to 14
cents higher with June at $18.87 a barrel; heating oil was .12 cent
to .33 cent higher with June at 51.96 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 64.21
cents a gallon.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended May 7, the Federal Reserve Board

   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,271.6 billion from $3,269.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,067.7 billion from $4,060.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $805.5 billion from $805.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 2.1 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,265.6 billion, a 5.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,065.5 billion, up 2.4 percent, while M1
rose 5.7 percent to an average of $805.0 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $4.51 billion in
the week ended May 9.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $319 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$286 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $559
million in the two weeks ended May 16, down from $842 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $306.1 billion in the two-week period ended May
16, up from $305.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Networks Seek New Ways of Counting Viewers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group representing the three networks has
asked the Nielsen ratings company to consider studying new ways of
counting viewers, a proposal that could change the industry's
standard ``people meter'' system, the company said Thursday.
   The request disclosed by Nielsen Media Research came from the
Committee on National Television Audience Measurement (CONTAM),
representing CBS, NBC, ABC and the National Association of
Broadcasters.
   The research company said it would consider the request. If a
decision is made to proceed with a study, test results would not be
available before the end of this year at the earliest.
   Nielsen also said its regular national service, which is based
on people-meter data, ``will remain in place at least through the
1990-91 season.''
   ABC, CBS and NBC annually pay Nielsen a total of $20 million for
its research data, according to a network official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   CONTAM's request comes at a time the networks are sharply
questioning data from Nielsen's people-meter system, which is in
4,000 homes.
   Among other things, the data for the first three months of this
year showed daytime viewing levels had taken their sharpest dive _
5.5 percent _ in recent memory.
   In a May 3 meeting here with about 300 network and advertising
exectives, Nielsen officials said they had found no flaws in
Nielsen's ratings system, but that they were studying it and
willing to work with the industry to improve it.
   The people-meter devices require participating viewers to log on
when they watch TV, thus telling Nielsen who is watching TV as well
as how many.
   The system now under fire by the networks became the industry
standard in 1987, replacing passive devices called audimeters that
only recorded TV set use, and gave raw numbers but not instant
demographic information.
   ``The people meter is supposed to do both, and obviously can't
do both,'' said Nicholas Schiavone, an NBC vice president for
marketing and sales research who is president of CONTAM.
   Uncertainty over the data could have an impact next month when
advertisers begin their so-called ``upfront'' buying of commercial
network time, which this year is estimated to be worth $9 billion
to $10 billion.
   The next step apparently is up to Schiavone's group. Jo LaVerde,
a Nielsen spokeswoman, said the company still was waiting for a
concrete proposal for a study from CONTAM.
   Proposals outlining the scope of the study then will have to be
exchanged and an agreement reached, ``because a proposal will not a
test make,'' she said.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca urged shareholders Thursday to hang on despite falling
profits and a slumping stock price, saying things will look better
by the time its Viper sports car goes into production in late 1992.
   At the company's annual meeting, Iacocca acknowledged that last
year's earnings were disappointing and sales have been slow. But he
counseled shareholders to take a long view, saying Chrysler has
prepared for strong performance in the 1990s.
   ``Nobody in this room is more frustrated than I am at our stock
sitting there at about $17 a share today,'' Iacocca said. ``Hell,
that means the stock is less than half the book value of the
company. And it's half a billion less than the cash we have in the
bank.''
   But he said that despite recent woes, the company is far better
off than a decade ago, when it survived only because the government
co-signed its loans. And he said that anyone who bought Chrysler
shares then would have earned a fine return.
   ``If you'd rushed out after our shareholder's meeting 10 years
ago and bought $1,000 worth of Chrysler stock and reinvested all
the dividends it would be worth $9,500 as you're sitting here
today. So yeah, I'm not too happy about that stock price right now.
But take the long view for a minute.''
   He also pledged to continue a yearly dividend of $1.20 per share
``barring a disaster.'
   He said a series of plant closures were regrettable, but
unavoidable, given U.S. car-building overcapacity. And he described
a $15.6 billion, five-year product development plan and $1 billion
research and development center as untouchable.
   On Friday, Iacocca is scheduled to reveal details of the
company's planned 10-cylinder Viper, which will compete with the
Chevrolet Corvette. The news conference will cap a six-city tour
promoting an ad campaign that claims the quality of Chrysler cars
now equals Japanese models and that they are the safest on the road.
   Briefly answering a few questions after the meeting, he said,
``I think we've got a good program. We'll come back in the next six
months.''
   Asked if it is appropriate to introduce an expensive,
limited-appeal car like the Viper at a time when car sales and
profits are falling, he implied things would be better when it is
introduced for the 1992 model year.
   ``It's going to take a year and a half yet,'' Iacocca said.
   Chrysler also is working on a new line of sleek, mid-size cars
and an additional model for its profitable Jeep line, among other
vehicles.
   Compared to 1980, Chrysler today has only one-tenth the debt
ratio, $4.3 billion in the bank versus $300 million, a $2.6 billion
credit line not dependent on Washington, a profitable credit
division, and a car market share about 3 percentage points higher,
at 13 percent, he said.
   He denied that his latest ad campaign constituted Japan-bashing,
saying he never said a word against the Japanese people or the
high-quality products they produce, but only against their trade
practices and the U.S. government for allowing them.
   ``One thing we've learned is that the competition will not
necessarily be a fair competition,'' Iacocca said.
   Questioned by shareholders, Iacocca acknowledged that service at
dealerships could be improved and that top Chrysler management
could benefit from more direct contact with people who buy and
build the vehicles.
   He also said he's hopeful that the U.S. auto industry will be
able to wean itself from heavy rebates, with the accompanying
artificially high sticker prices, although he wouldn't predict when
that would happen.
   ``I'd like to do away with them,'' Iacocca said. ``We're all
sort of on dope. We got onto it 10 years ago, and now we can't get
off it.''

<HEAD>Say Phone Giant Breaking the Rules with New Credit Card</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major banks accused American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. on Thursday of violating federal telephone and
banking regulations with its new Visa and MasterCard credit card.
   The banks, in a filing with the Federal Communications
Commission and other regulatory agencies, said that by offering 10
percent long-distance discounts to holders of its AT&amp;T Universal
Card, the telephone giant was illegally discriminating against
other AT&amp;T customers.
   The discount was provided ``simply to promote AT&amp;T's entrance
into the general purpose consumer credit card market,'' the banks
told the FCC.
   AT&amp;T said the allegations of illegal behavior were ``absolutely
without merit.''
   The FCC filing cited published reports estimating that AT&amp;T
could have 5 million customers for its credit card by the end of
this year.
   Credit card industry officials have said that consumers loaded
down with bulging wallets full of plastic probably would find a
combined credit card attractive _ and put big pressure on
traditional bank cards.
   The banks _ BankAmerica Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp.
and MBNA America Bank _ also made filings with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve, said Doug Jones, the
FDIC's deputy general counsel.
   ``They're alleging banking violations,'' Jones said. He didn't
elaborate.
   FDIC spokesman David Barr said the banks had sent a 53-page
petition to the agency on Tuesday, with a 10-page cover letter to
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman. AT&amp;T spokesman Jim McGann said
the banks also filed a complaint with the Georgia state banking
commission.
   The banks said AT&amp;T was charging discriminatory phone rates; had
failed to have the 10 percent discount approved; failed to file
tariffs for finance charges and late charges imposed on the card
users; and discriminated against other credit card holders in
access to phone service.
   Peter Gallagher, senior vice president for corporate and
consumer affairs at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services Corp., said AT&amp;T
was not violating telephone rules. The card is issued through
Universal Bank in Georgia.
   ``I'm absolutely confident we are in total compliance with the
appropriate laws, rules and regulations,'' Gallagher said.
   He also rejected the banks' assertion that Universal Bank was
acting as a reseller of phone services, which also would fall under
FCC regulation, and that the Universal Card discriminated against
non-AT&amp;T credit card holders who try to use AT&amp;T coinless pay
phones.
   ``We are not going to be deterred by any diversionary tactics,''
Gallagher said. ``We're committed to the credit card business.
We're here to stay.''
   He declined to disclose how many people had signed up for the
card but said the response ``has been wonderful.''

<HEAD>PacifiCorp Again Raises Offer For Pinnacle West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PacifiCorp on Thursday increased its bid for
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. to $1.82 billion, the fourth offer in
six months by the Portland, Ore.-based utility giant for Arizona's
largest power company or its parent.
   David F. Bolender, president of PacifiCorp's electric
operations, said it would be the last offer. Pressed by reporters
at a news conference here, Bolender added that the bid would be
withdrawn if there was no progress within a few weeks.
   Pinnacle West, which went from the robust holding company for
Arizona Public Service Co. to the brink of reorganization after
buying MeraBank in 1984, will hold its annual meeting Wednesday.
   Last month, some stockholders of Pinnacle West urged management,
including new Chairman Richard Snell, to accept PacifiCorp's next
offer.
   Pinnacle West spokesman Steve Carr said the company's directors
would seriously consider the takeover package.
   Under the offer, Pinnacle West shareholders would receive $21 in
cash for each share of stock.
   Wall Street cheered the offer. Pinnacle West shares jumped
$3.62{ to close at $16.37{ in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Kathleen A. Lally, an analyst with County NatWest Securities in
New York, called the offer ``very attractive'' and said that if
Pinnacle West ignored it, the company could face lawsuits by angry
shareholders.
   In November, PacifiCorp offered $1.7 billion for Arizona Public
Service. Pinnacle West, then controlled by Chairman Keith Turley,
rejected that bid. In December, it rejected another offer, this
time for all of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries but MeraBank,
which lost more than $400 million in the last two years.
   In early March, Pinnacle West rejected a third offer that its
directors said was equivalent to $16 per share. That offer was for
a common-stock swap valued at $1.7 billion and an exchange of
Arizona Public Service preferred stock, worth $372 million, plus
assumption of debt.
   Federal regulators took control of MeraBank Jan. 31, but the
holding company was forced to borrow $450 million to bring the
failed thrift up to capital requirements, increasing its debt to
$1.1 billion.
   Pinnacle West, which has suspended its dividends, made $4.2
million in 1988 and reported a $551.4 million loss for 1989.
   In its latest offer, PacifiCorp also agreed to assume all debt
of Pinnacle West and Arizona Public Service.
   In addition, Bolender said PacifiCorp would retain an offer to
limit Arizona Public Service rate increases to 2 percent per year
for four years, which is less than a 6{ percent-per-year,
three-year proposal filed by the utility with state regulators.

<HEAD>Drivers Rally Outside Financial Backers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Greyhound drivers took their picket
lines to the company's financial backers Thursday and urged them to
pressure the financially strapped bus line back to the bargaining
table.
   ``If Greyhound goes under, they go under,'' Ellis B. Franklin,
vice president of the Amalgamated Transit Uniont, said as about 60
supporters of the 11-week-old strike rallied outside the offices of
PaineWebber Inc.
   Franklin said the investment bank owns 16 percent of the closely
held bus company's parent firm.
   Similar rallies were held outside brokerages and other financial
institutions in seven other cities.
   A call to PaineWebber was not immediately returned.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said he expected the rallies
to have no effect on lenders.
   ``Companies that put up millions of dollars are not going to
make decisions based on some rally,'' Gravley said.
   Greyhound is continuing to operate reduced services with about
3,000 strikebreakers. The firm lost $56 million in the first three
months of this year and has missed payments on its debt obligations.
   Earlier this week Standard &amp; Poor's, a leading credit rating
agency, lowered Greyhound's rating to D, denoting a default on its
debt.
   In Washington, strikers chanted ``Contract'' and ``Negotiate
Now'' as they walked in a circle on a busy downtown street at
noontime. Cheers went up when Franklin announced the credit rating
drop.
   Gravley dismissed the credit rating drop as a ``technicality.''
The company expected the move after announcing its first quarter
loss and plans to miss a $9.75 million interest payment that was
due on Tuesday, he said.
   For weeks, Greyhound refused to resume negotiations with the
union because of dozens of shootings and bomb threats.
   When talks finally resumed two weeks ago, the union called the
company's offer an ``insult.'' Last week, Greyhound Chairman Fred
Currey claimed victory and dismissed the strike as irrelevant.
   ``Regardless of what Mr. Currey says, the ATU is not going
anywhere. We'll be here forever,'' Franklin told the picket line.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Says It Will Lower Evening Rates 2.5 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: ADDS 6 grafs of background on reductions and price caps.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said
Thursday it planned to lower its interstate and international rates
by about $160 million annually, effective July 1.
   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, AT&amp;T
said it would reduce by $100 million its prices for direct-dialed
interstate calls during evening hours. That represents a reduction
of about 2.5 percent.
   An additional $60 million reduction would take place in other
long-distance and operator services, the company added.
   But it also plans to eliminate the free call to interstate
directory service now offered each month. The company said its
research showed that only one in four residential customers uses
that directory assistance over a three-month period.
   The changes require FCC approval.
   The company said that during evening calling hours, 5 p.m. to 11
p.m., Sunday through Friday, the price of a 10-minute direct-dialed
call to anywhere in the continental United States will cost $1.53
or less. Today such a call costs $1.58 or less.
   The decrease is AT&amp;T's 11th since 1984 following the breakup of
the old Bell system. The decrease would bring the company's total
long-distance reductions to 42 percent during that period.
   AT&amp;T's main competitors, MCI and US Sprint, have tended to drop
their prices in line with AT&amp;T.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Jim McGann said the $60 million portion of the
reduction was in anticipation of an expected adjustment by the FCC
in what long-distance carriers pay to connect with local phone
networks.
   Much of the post-1984 reductions in long-distance rates has been
because of FCC-ordered reductions in so-called access charges. When
the long-distance carriers paid less, they were required to pass
those savings along to customers.
   But in July 1989, the FCC imposed a new regulatory structure
that caps the prices AT&amp;T charges instead of its profits. As a
result, AT&amp;T doesn't automatically pass through its savings to
customers.
   ``We're not required anymore to directly, dollar for dollar,
pass through reductions to us, for instance in access,'' McGann
said. ``What we're required to do is stay below the cap.''
   In fact, last November AT&amp;T raised interstate night and weekend
calling rates by 1.3 percent _ a $34 million annual increase.
   McGann said competition and increased productivity was the best
guarantee of lower prices. He said AT&amp;T's evening prices already
were below the price caps, and the new reduction will drop them
even farther below.

   Exxon Co. USA has announced a realignment of its
exploration operations that will result in about 200 layoffs.
   The company said Thursday it would combine its western and
eastern divisions into one operation to find oil and gas in the 48
contiguous states. The job cuts will be divided evenly between
Midland, Texas, and Denver.
   ``This change is designed to improve the efficiency of
conducting our business in today's highly competitive business
environment,'' said S.M. Cassiani, vice president of exploration
for Exxon USA, the domestic subsidiary of Exxon Corp.
   Exxon said it would combine the western exploration division,
with offices in Midland and Denver, with the Houston-based eastern
exploration division.
   The changes will be completed by late summer, Exxon said.
   Exxon said a small complement of people will remain in Denver
doing project acquisition and the southwestern production division
will retain its Midland operations.

<HEAD>Pratt &amp; Whitney to Enter Soviet Aviation Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney said it is entering
the developing Soviet aviation market through a three-way pact with
the Soviet government and a West German engine maker.
   Although the agreement is short on specifics, Pratt officials
said it opens the door to cooperative ventures on small- to
medium-sized commercial aviation engines.
   Pratt spokeswoman Peggy Ford said the agreement could involve
the co-development of a new engine. Soviet participation in
production of engines made by Pratt and Motoren und Turbinen Union
also will be considered, she said.
   The cooperation is likely to involve the use of engines with up
to 40,000 pounds of thrust _ about equal to most recent outgrowths
of Pratt's PW2000 series, Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan said.
   The engines likely would be used on Soviet-built airframes,
Sullivan said, although he said the agreement does not exclude the
possibility of engines powering Western-built aircraft.
   Sullivan said the agreement takes into account a suit Pratt
rival General Electric Co. filed against MTU recently. That suit
seeks to stop a new MTU-Pratt partnership to develop larger
versions of Pratt's PW4000 engine.
   The suit charges that permitting MTU to collaborate with Pratt
would jeopardize technology GE has shared with the West German
company.
   Pratt's announcement boosts the East Hartford-based jet-engine
maker into the Soviet engine arena at a time when GE has been
touting its early successes there.
   Most recently, GE, based in Fairfield, landed a $150 million
deal to supply as many as 10 of its CF6-80C2 engines to the Soviets
to power Airbus Industrie A310-300s. The planes by the France-based
European consortium will be the country's first western-built
aircraft.

   Navistar International Corp. said net income
plunged 77 percent in its fiscal second quarter because of an
industry-wide decline in retail truck sales.
   Chicago-based Navistar, the country's biggest manufacturer of
medium- and heavy-duty trucks, said net income in the three months
ended April 30 was $8 million or 1 cent a share, compared with $35
million or 11 cents a share in the same period a year ago.
   Sales fell 10 percent to $1 billion from $1.1 billion.
   Chairman James C. Cotting said industry-wide sales of medium and
heavy trucks in North America fell 12 percent in the first three
months of 1990 to 71,000 units.
   Navistar's fiscal second-quarter deliveries of 22,200 units were
10 percent below the same quarter a year earlier, Cotting said in a
statement.
   For the first half of fiscal 1990, Navistar lost $10 million or
10 cents a share on sales of $1.9 billion. In the comparable 1989
period, the company earned $72 million or 23 cents a share on sales
of $2.2 billion.

<HEAD>Investor Group Holds 59 Percent of AI's Junior Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York-based investor group seeking
control of Allegheny International Inc. said Thursday it had
acquired 59 percent of the troubled appliance maker's junior debt
through a public tender offer.
   The offer by Japonica Partners expired Wednesday. Control of the
debt could put Japonica in a strong position to get its
reorganization proposal approved by creditors of the company, which
sells the Sunbeam and Oster brands.
   A preliminary count showed Japonica received tenders for $69.5
million of the $111.5 million principal value outstanding of three
series of Allegheny International subordinated debt, Japonica said
in a statement.
   It offered to buy those bonds at prices ranging from 27.7 cents
to 41 cents on the dollar.
   It also received $6 million out of $17.3 million principal
amount of subordinated debt of Chemetron Corp., an Allegheny
International subsidiary, by offering 83.8 cents on the dollar.
   Japonica previously purchased significant percentages of the
company's secured bank and senior unsecured claims and used its
voting power to ensure a company-sponsored reorganization plan was
defeated in a creditors' vote.
   Allegheny International has been in Chapter 11 reorganization
since February 1988. The company is seeking to get its
reorganization plan confirmed by U.S. Bankruptcy Court. It has
asked the court to nullify Japonica's votes.
   Company spokesman Edward Romanoff declined comment on the
Japonica offer Thursday.
   Japonica's $655 million reorganization proposal would pay cash
to all of Allegheny International's creditors and shareholders. The
company's plan would repay most claims other than trade debt in new
stock.
   Allegheny International values its plan at $687 million, but
Japonica has claimed that figure is inflated.
   Allegheny International's unsecured creditors' committee said in
a letter last week that it judged the value of the two plans to be
about equal.

<HEAD>FBI Agent Defends His Abilities on Trading Floor</HEAD>

   An undercover FBI agent told jurors Thursday he
traded thousands of commodities contracts for customers while
secretely recording pit traders' conversations during an
unprecedented sting operation.
   FBI Agent Randall Jannett took the witness stand to defend his
ability to spot illegal trading during a wide-ranging federal probe
of corruption at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Forty-seven traders and a clerk in the world's two largest
commodity exchanges were indicted last year as a result of the
investigation. Prosecutors contend that traders diverted customer
profits into their own accounts.
   Sixteen of those charged have pleaded guilty to reduced charges
and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
   Jannett specialized in Swiss franc futures during 1988. A Swiss
franc future is a contract to buy or sell that currency at a future
date at a price agreed upon in advance.
   Jannett and another FBI agent, posing as inexperienced
commodities traders investing family money, passed all the tests
required to trade on the exchange floor. They bought seats on the
exchange and opened their own trading company.
   Defense attorneys for the first three traders to go to trial _
Danny L. Scheck, Robert D. Mosky and David Zatz _ told jurors last
week that Jannett was so confused by the frantic pace of activity
on the floor that he mistook legal transactions for attempts to
defraud customers.
   Jannett's testimony Thursday was devoted to establishing his
credentials as a commodities trader and showing jurors how he hid a
tape recorder inside his red trading jacket. The three traders are
being tried before U.S. District Court Judge Ann C. Williams.
   The government's case rests partly on those taped conversations.
Defense attorneys contend the recordings are incomprehensible
because of the harried shouting typical of the trading floor.
   They also contend that Jannett was so inexperienced that he
mistook traders' attempts to verify transactions for schemes to
steal customers profits.
   Prosecutors are expected to begin playing hours of recorded
trading floor action when trial resumes Friday.
