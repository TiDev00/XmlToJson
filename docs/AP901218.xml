   A tractor-trailer collided Tuesday with a
Greyhound bus and a truck on an icy highway, killing seven people
and injuring 41, authorities said.
   Seventeen people were hospitalized, four in critical condition,
after the 9 a.m. accident on Interstate 80 near the Wyoming line.
   The bus, en route to Chicago from Salt Lake City, had more than
40 passengers. Greyhound dispatcher Bill Moore said he could not
provide an exact count.
   All of the dead were passengers on the bus, said sheriff's Sgt.
Robert Berry. The bus driver and one of the truck drivers were
among the injured.
   At the crash scene, coats, luggage and other debris were strewn
around the bus, which lay on its right side. Frozen hams from one
of the trucks also littered the highway.
   Berry said authorities searched luggage for clues to passengers'
identities.
   A witness, Blaine Whimpe of Morgan, Utah, said a westbound truck
apparently slid into the eastbound lanes, colliding with a second
truck and the bus. The bus turned on its side, he said.
   ``I could see the bus. There were people up on top of the bus
pulling people out. Everybody that came out of the bus that I had
seen was hurt, broken arms, legs, cuts,'' Whimpe said. ``They were
just all moaning and groaning and freezing. They wanted a warm
place to get into.''
   Whimpe described the road condition as ``terrible.''
   The Highway Patrol siad the roads were extremely icy, with winds
gusting to near 30 mph and falling snow making driving treacherous.
The National Weather Service estimated that visibility in the area
at three-quarters of a mile.
   The injured were taken to Evanston Regional Hospital in Wyoming,
10 miles from the accident, where 14 people were admitted,
including a woman in critical condition, said spokeswoman Janet
Kolb.
   Three others with head injuries were flown to Salt Lake, one to
LDS Hospital and two to the University of Utah Medical Center. All
remained in critical condition late Tuesday, nursing supervisors
said.
   Passenger Stuart Palmer of Buffalo, N.Y., said the bus driver
could do nothing after one of the trucks slammed into the left side
of the bus, forcing it off the road and down a 35-foot embankment.
   Palmer was released from the hospital with a broken ankle and a
bruised knee.
   The accident closed both eastbound and westbound I-80 from
Evanston to Silver Creek Junction, Utah, for five hours.
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it
was dispatching a team of investigators to look into the accident.
   Greyhound officials were also dispatched to Emory, Moore said,
but he declined further comment until a report was filed by the
company's representatives at the scene.
   The Wyoming Army National Guard armory in Evanston was opened
for passengers on the bus who had nowhere to go.
   The Utah Highway Patrol set up a hotline for families of
accident victims, said Sgt. Gary Whitney. The number is
801-965-4518.
   Last week, twelve people died in an 83-car pileup on a foggy
stretch of Interstate 75 near Chatanooga, Tenn. More than 50 people
were injured.

<HEAD>Six Cities Chosen as Finalists for Baseball Teams</HEAD>

   Six U.S. cities, three of them in Florida, have
been selected as finalists for two new baseball teams.
   Proposals were selected Tuesday from Buffalo, N.Y., Denver,
Miami, Orlando, Fla., St. Petersburg-Tampa, Fla., and Washington.
Eliminated from the running were Nashville, Tenn., Charlotte, N.C.,
Phoenix and Sacramento, Calif.
   The National League has said two new teams will begin play in
1993. Their home cities will be selected by next September.
   ``The cities on the list are the best in terms of market size,
government commitment to support baseball, and stadium facilities
in place or planned,'' said Doug Danforth, head of the league
expansion committee.

   Here is a chronology of events in the case
of Byron De La Beckwith, arrested in Tennessee after being indicted
again in the 1963 assassination of civil rights leader Medgar
Evers:
   -June 12, 1963. Evers, the Mississippi NAACP field secretary, is
shot in the back outside his home.
   -June 21, 1963. Beckwith is arrested by the FBI on a civil
rights complaint. Authorities say his fingerprint was found on the
telescopic sight of a rifle found near the scene. Beckwith claims
the rifle was stolen from his home.
   -Jan. 27, 1964. Beckwith's first state trial on a murder charge
begins with an all-white jury. The trial ends in a hung jury on
Feb. 7.
   -April 6, 1964. Beckwith's second trial begins, again with an
all-white jury. Jurors report they are deadlocked on April 17.
   -1969. The murder charge against Beckwith is dismissed.
   -1973. Beckwith is arrested in New Orleans and convicted of
possessing dynamite without a permit. He served five years in
prison.
   -October 1989. Published reports say the Mississippi Sovereignty
Commission, a now-defunct state segregationist watchdog agency,
screened potential jurors in Beckwith's second trial. Prosecutors
later announce they found no evidence of jury tampering.
   -Oct. 3, 1989. Evers widow, Myrlie, asks that her husband's
murder case be reopened. Jackson City Council, NAACP and others
support reopening the case.
   -March 11, 1990. District Attorney Ed Peters announces there are
new leads in the Evers case.
   -Dec. 17, 1990. Beckwith is arrested in Tennessee on a fugitive
warrant issued by the state of Mississippi.

   Liberal-conservative barricades within the
nation's churches have limited religious groups' ability to help
Americans develop a common ground to discuss moral issues. The
third installment of a four-part series, ``Unholy Wars: Religion in
Public Life,'' examines the consequences.

<TEXT>
   Religion in America was simpler in the 1950s.
   The phrase ``under God'' was added to the Pledge of Allegiance,
Catholics, evangelicals, Jews and Muslims kept a low profile, and a
pecking order helped a community's most prominent citizens
gravitate toward mainline Protestant institutions such as the
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches.
   But then a series of sociological changes shook nearly 3{
centuries of Protestant hegemony, ranging from the rapid rise of
evangelicalism, to the surge of Catholics to equal Protestants in
income and education, to judicial rulings limiting the influence of
religion in public life.
   In explaining what happened in his Midwest community, one
mainline Protestant executive told Hartford Seminary Dean William
McKinney, ``You have to understand the neighborhood changed when
the whites moved out and the Irish Catholics moved in.''
   The demographic shifts have not led to a passive changing of the
guard, but to what some observers see as increasingly bitter
divisions between liberals and conservatives that threaten
religion's traditional role of supplying society with a common set
of moral standards.
   ``Religious people have got to get their act together,'' said
Dean Thomas Ogletree of Yale Divinity School. ``If we're unable to
talk to one another because we're so divided, the larger society is
wise to say, `Let's keep religion out of it because they'll just
mess it up.' ''
   In a 1984 Gallup Poll, 31 percent of religious conservatives
held negative stereotypes of religious liberals, while only 7
percent found similar faults with themselves. The range of
intolerance was even greater on the religious left, where 41
percent held negative views of conservatives, while only 3 percent
said liberal sterotypes were valid.
   ``The division is at least as strong, if not stronger than it
was five years ago,'' said Robert Wuthnow, a Princeton University
sociology professor who has studied the issue.
   America may be heralded as a haven for religious freedom, but it
also has a history of religious bigotry.
   At the founding of the country, most states had laws
discriminating against Catholics and formally establishing either
Anglican or Congregational churches.
   Strong anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic attitudes existed into the
1950s, despite a veneer of placid tolerance epitomized by President
Eisenhower's declaration that, ``Our government makes no sense
unless it is founded on a deeply felt religious faith - and I don't
care what it is.''
   But the '60s and '70s saw unprecedented ecumenical advances,
fueled by such things as a broad range of religious groups working
together on the civil rights movement, Pope John XXIII opening the
windows of the Catholic Church to the world with the Second Vatican
Council, and a series of theological statements from Christian
groups apologizing for their past anti-Semitism.
   ``I think if you look at any long time line, the trend is only
up,'' said Jacqueline Wexler, president of the National Conference
of Christians and Jews.
   But many observers say the resurgence of Catholics and
born-again Christian evangelicals into the public arena has brought
about a renewal of religious prejudice.
   Thirty percent of the respondents in a Gallup survey last year
said they would not welcome religious fundamentalists as neighbors.
By comparison, only 5 percent said they would not welcome
Protestants in general or Jews.
   At a Reformation Day service in October at Yale Divinity School,
Lutheran theologian George Lindbeck lamented that anti-Catholicism
has become in some corners ``the anti-Semitism of intellectuals.''
   McKinney, who is studying mainline Protestant executives and who
authored ``American Mainline Religion: Its Changing Shape and
Future,'' agreed.
   ``I think anti-Catholicism is the last respectable American
prejudice,'' he said.
   The liberal-conservative barricades cross denominational lines.
Many religious conservatives, who tend to emphasize spirituality,
prayer and Bible study over social concerns, have begun to form
their own organizations within mainline churches. The Good News
movement in the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Lay
Committee and the Episcopal Synod of America are examples.
   In more conservative denominations such as the Southern Baptist
Convention, those who favor greater acceptance of divergent
theological views also have formed their own lobbying groups, such
as the Southern Baptist Alliance.
   But the liberal-conservative divide may not be as wide as each
side might think.
   Princeton's Wuthnow said his research indicates conservatives
are more tolerant and socially concerned than liberals think they
are; some conservative churches, for example, have established
programs to help the homeless and counsel the unemployed.
   In the Brookings Institution study ``Religion in American Public
Life,'' A. James Reichley said many religious conservatives
approach the abortion struggle with the same ardor liberals fought
for civil rights.
   ``On the issue of abortion, they believe it is the liberals who
are countenancing mass destruction of potential life, while
fundamentalists, in alliance with Catholics, stand up for the most
vulnerable of all forms of human life - the unborn,'' Reichley
said.
   At the same time, Wuthnow said, liberals are more devout in
their faith than conservatives think they are, as shown by a
renewed interest in evangelism and Bible study.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, spiritual leader of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, said more than 9,000 of the
denomination's 11,000 congregations ordered tapes of a
church-sponsored faith-development program.
   ``That's indicative of a very deep hunger for faith development
among our people,'' he said.
   And partnerships are being fostered. For the first time in a
generation, religious groups across the board now are forming
coalitions on issues ranging from apartheid to pornography.
   ``Many religious leaders have a sense of being in the same boat.
They sense, as they once did not, the danger of religion being
totally driven out of a public role in society,'' Reichley said.
   Pressure has grown in recent years to consider on secular
grounds issues ranging from abortion to nuclear war, as more people
view religion as a set of divisive, sectarian interests, Wuthnow
said.
   When you take out the moral values supplied by religion, he
said, ``Then what becomes important are issues of economics,
political expediency, practicality.''
   Those are the wrong guidelines to use for deciding issues such
as euthanasia, genetic engineering, allocation of limited health
care resources and even whether the nation should go to war,
Wuthnow and others said.
   In the new religious climate, the ability to compromise is seen
as a high moral value, said Ogletree, of Yale Divinity School.
   ``The alternative to compromise is moral anarchy or religious
conflict,'' he said.

   Some Scrooges say it's ``those little red and green things''
that make them think you'd have to be nuttier than a fruitcake to
eat one. Others drag out the joke. You know, the one about there
being just one fruitcake that gets passed around and around and
around.
   ``It's the only thing that everybody doesn't like, except
lutefisk,'' the humorist Calvin Trillin says, referring to a
Norwegian dried cod dish.
   But have you ever eaten fruitcake, Mr. Trillin?
   ``I think I had a bite once, 20 years ago. It was before I knew.
I was an innocent,'' he says. ``Probably it was Christmas, the fire
was going, the presents were being unwrapped, or maybe they already
were unwrapped.''
   Fruitcake has had its share of humiliation. Johnny Carson and
columnist Russell Baker have poked fun. Nearly a third of the
people surveyed by American Express a couple of years back said it
was the worst gift of all.
   Well, Mr. Trillin, Mr. Baker and all you other naysayers, enough
already.
   ``It's sort of an annual plague,'' said Susan Purdy, author of
the cookbook ``A Piece of Cake,'' who argues there's more to
fruitcake than men of this ilk know.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and tell you that when you hear a
fruitcake joke, it doesn't make you kind of mad. It does,'' said W.
Dale Parker, a vice president at the granddaddy of fruitcake
bakers, Claxton Bakery Inc. in Claxton, Ga.
   Parker's family business bakes 5 million pounds of fruitcake a
year.
   ``Obviously, there's a lot of people out there eating
fruitcake,'' Parker said.
   ``We get some rave reviews, that it's just like the one
grandmother wanted to bake but couldn't,'' boasts Father Andrew of
the Holy Cross Abbey in Berryville, Va., where each year the
Monastery Bakery turns out 13,000 traditional fruit- and
nut-studded cakes laced with brandy.
   So, Mr. Trillin, how do you suppose these companies stay in
business?
   People ``are buying them, and they're giving them to other
people. But that doesn't mean they're eating them,'' he said.
``I've been given a lot of fruitcakes as gifts.''
   Richard Sullivan of the Glace Fruit Processors admits some
fruitcakes taste like sawdust. His father always got one for
Christmas that was ``dense and bitter. I never liked the thing.''
   Ah, but then there are good ones.
   ``They have to have wonderful fruits,'' said Purdy, who uses
mangoes, papayas, apricots, dates, nuts, dried apples, pears and
plums. She advises: ``Avoid little red and green and yellow
things.''
   ``A good fruitcake to me is like eating candy,'' Sullivan said.
``I just love it.''
   Melvin Gordon, president of Paradise Fruit Inc. in Plant City,
Fla., said he doesn't know how fruitcake got such a lousy
reputation.
   He notes that his industry sells 50 million pounds of candied
fruit a year, and if he could talk to Mr. Trillin, he'd say:
``Fruitcake has been around a lot longer than you and I.''
   Even some particular fruitcakes can claim that.
   In ``Enough's Enough,'' a new collection of Trillin's columns,
he mentions a family in Michigan ``that brings out an antique
fruitcake every Christmas, a fruitcake that for some reason was not
eaten at Christmas dinner in 1895 and has symbolized the holidays
ever since.''
   Mr. Trillin, meet Morgan Ford of Tecumseh, Mich., keeper of a
cake baked not in 1895, he says, but in 1878 by his
great-grandmother.
   When she died early the following year, the cake was forgotten
for a while. Today, it's in an airtight glass box, Ford said.
``There's a musty rum smell there yet,'' he said.
   When his uncle, then 86, took a bite a couple decades back, Ford
said, ``He had to cut it off with his jacknife, sliver it off. It
doesn't look too appetizing to me.''
   As if to ward off the inevitable, Ford notes right away that his
uncle lived two more years.
   ``If I make it to 86 - and I'm 70 - I'll taste it then,'' he
said.
   But he could be persuaded to give into temptation by Johnny
Carson, who has poked fun at the cake. ``If he'd take a bite,''
Ford said, ``I'd take a bite.''
   Go ahead, Mr. Trillin, joke about ``heirloom'' or ``antique''
fruitcakes. Age can be a virtue.
   The late James Beard, often called the dean of American food,
once wrote that his mother baked fruitcakes a full year ahead, and
kept some of her wedding fruitcake for a quarter-century by
periodically lacing it with cognac.
   The ancient Romans, Purdy said, baked fruitcakes called
``satura,'' Latin for a ``full dish'' and the root of the word
satire (perhaps the Romans had one up on you, Mr. Trillin.).
   Martha Washington made one for family holidays. Before
refrigeration, the sugar and spirits in fruitcakes acted as
preservatives.
   As recently as 50 years ago, no one chortled over fruitcake.
   ``Our taste has changed. We don't like things that are too
heavy, too sweet,'' Purdy said. ``We're talking about an antique
cake in contemporary life, and it's trying to make the
transition.''
   So, go ahead, take your potshots, Mr. Trillin and Co. But,
honestly, wouldn't you be in a holiday funk if nobody at all
remembered you with a fruitcake?

   There are December nights when Beverly Nyberg,
who works all day, looks up from frosting ginger cookies and finds
it's 3 a.m.
   ``It's a mad rush. That's the essence of Christmas cookies,''
said Nyberg, a commercial artist at a New York advertising agency.
   Why do it, then? ``For tradition, for love,'' she said. Her
mother, now nearly 80, used to make at least 30 kinds of Christmas
cookies. Nyberg's 20-year-old son already is asking what kinds mom
is making this year.
   Her favorites are thumbprints, a sugar cookie covered with nuts
and rolled in a ball. A thumb stuck in the middle before baking
leaves a depression just right for frosting or jam.
   Throughout December, cooks everywhere take out traditional and
new-found recipes, baking nights and weekends to fill old shoe
boxes or tins with cookies, carefully layered with wax paper, to
freeze until Christmas.
   ``Yeah, your body complains'' from the effort, Nyberg said. But
the payoff is ``the enjoyment that everyone is walking by and
grabbing cookies off the plate when it comes to the D-day of
Christmas.''
   Food historian William Woys Weaver of Devon, Pa., said he tries
new cookies each year, but always returns to old favorites such as
a German cookie called chocolate apeas.
   ``I made some for some children last week and a little girl
said, `These even taste like Christmas.' I said, `Good, good,
that's just what I want to hear,' '' Weaver said.
   ``Nothing represents the spirit of loving, nurturing and giving
more than a homemade cookie,'' Rose Levy Beranbaum writes in her
new book, ``Rose's Christmas Cookies.''
   ``They're always exactly the right size, they look so appealing,
they taste so delicious; they're satisfying but not too filling,''
Judy Knipe and Barbara Marks write in ``The Christmas Cookie
Book.''
   In many homes, the morning before Christmas, the shoe boxes and
cookie tins come out and gift baskets are arranged for delivery
later that day. Little hands take delight in decorating cut-out
sugar cookies with sprinkles and red hots, some to be left that
night for Santa Claus.
   Marks will make eight or 10 kinds of cookies this year,
including ginger pecan slices, chocolate orange chunk cookies and
lemon drops, carrying on a tradition learned at the elbow of her
mother and other relatives. Especially her dad's Aunt Marie.
   ``I would get so exicted, and a month before Christmas I would
go over on Saturdays and bake with her,'' Marks said. ``Getting to
go somewhere all by yourself at 7 or 8 was really something.''
   Much of the year, home baking is something of a lost art. The
Nestle Toll House Kitchen in Purchase, N.Y., cites studies showing
that only 35 percent of the baked goods eaten last year were made
at home. But nearly all the people surveyed said they bake for the
holidays, Nestle said.
   ``Cookie'' comes from the Dutch, koekje, the diminutive for
cake. But cookies are easier to make and more forgiving of the
novice's mistakes than cakes, Beranbaum said.
   Americans have always loved Christmas cookies, Weaver said.
Colonists could afford sweets only for special occasions. And while
Christmas cookies in the shapes of animals and people were made for
children, they appealed to everyone, he said.
   ``It was a release, a fantasy food in a sense. ... The adult
who's making camels and what have you, I think they're going back
to childhood a little, don't you?'' Weaver said. ``Of course, they
taste very good, too.''
   Among the earliest cookies were gingerbread, which came both
from Germany and from England and Scotland, Weaver writes in ``The
Christmas Cook.''
   By the late 19th century, refined sugar, eggs and flour were
available to most people, and the cast-iron stove gave homemakers
more control over baking than they had at the hearth, he said.
   That, combined with a wave of immigration, broadened the home
cook's repertoire, which now includes cookies from much of the
world, he said.
   In her Greenwich Village apartment, Beranbaum shows off what
look like stained glass windows: sugar cookies with intricate
cutouts, filled with crushed sour balls that become translucent
when baked. She also bakes exquisite, delicate snowflakes that
sparkle when hung from the branches of a lighted tree.
   Beranbaum's book has traditional, elegant cookies; down-home
green wreaths made with marshmallows and cornflakes; even brownies.
In ``The Christmas Cookie Book,'' the sharing is evident from the
many recipes with a name attached: Amy's molasses puffs, Renata's
vanilla crescents, Holly's ginger crisps.
   When Beranbaum worked in the test kitchen of the Ladies Home
Journal, her first story was on cookies, for the Christmas of 1975.
But Christmas has long been part of this Jewish New Yorker's life.
   ``I grew up with the feeling that in New York, Chistmas was a
joyous cultural celebration belonging to everyone and not
restricted only to those who observed it as a religious holiday,''
she writes.
   Because of her book, Beranbaum doesn't have time to bake cookies
for family and friends this year, but she likes one way of
considering her situation:
   Give a gift of Christmas cookies and you spruce up one holiday.
Give a book that teaches how to bake them and you feed Christmases
forever.

   Here are two Christmas cookie recipes:
   
   Lebkuchen, from ``The Christmas Cook,'' by William Woys Weaver
(Harper Perennial, $18.95)
   A traditional German Christmas cookie, large, thick and chewy.
   Yield: Approximately 7 dozen
   8} cups all-purpose flour
   2{ tablespoons baking soda
   1 tablespoon ground cloves
   1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
   1 tablespoon ground cardamom
   4 cups ground almonds
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped citron
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons honey
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
   4 tablespoons brandy
   
   Sift the flour, soda and spices together twice. Add the ground
almonds and citron. Mix the honey and molasses in a saucepan and
heat to a gentle boil. Remove from the stove. Make a hole in the
center of the flour, and add the honey mixture while still hot. As
you stir this into the flour, gradually add the brandy. Work this
up into a ball of dough, cover and set aside to ripen in the
refrigerator for eight days. The dough will rise in bulk as it
ripens.
   On the eighth day, roll out the dough \-inch thick and cut into
2{-inch rounds. Set these on greased baking sheets, cover and store
in a cool place overnight.
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
   Bake the cookies 12 to 15 minutes, or until fully risen and pale
brown on the bottom. Cool on racks. As they cool, the cookies will
harden. Store in airtight containers.
   
   ---
   
   Stained Glass, from ``Rose's Christmas Cookies,'' by Rose Levy
Beranbaum (William Morrow and Co. Inc., $19.95)
   Yield: 4 dozen 3-inch cookies
   2} cups bleached all-purpose flour
   { teaspoon baking powder
   { teaspoon salt
   Two-thirds cup sugar
   1 cup unsalted butter
   About half a large egg, lightly beaten
   1{ teaspoons pure vanilla extract
   &lsqb; teaspoon lemon extract
   1 cup sour balls
   
   Soften the butter. In a mixing bowl, cream together the sugar
and butter until fluffy. Add the egg and extracts and beat until
blended. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining dry
ingredients. On low speed, gradually add them to the butter mixture
and mix just until the dough can be gathered into a ball.
   Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and use the wrap,
not your fingers, to press the dough together to form a thick flat
disc. Wrap it well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes,
preferably no longer than three hours.
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
   Separate the sour balls into individual colors and pulverize
them separately in a blender or food processor. Place each color in
a small container and set aside.
   Using about a quarter of the dough at a time, roll out the dough
to &lsqb;-inch thickness between two sheets of plastic wrap or on a
lightly floured counter. Cut out cookies with a three-inch cookie
cutter, spraying or greasing the cutter as needed to prevent
sticking.
   With a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner, transfer
the cookies to cookie sheets lined with aluminum foil and greased.
If you are planning to hang the cookies, make small holes with the
blunt end of a wooden skewer.
   Cut out shapes for the stained glass in each cookie with small
cutters or with a small sharp knife. Use the tip of a small sharp
knife to fill the holes with candy pieces, filling just to the top
of the dough.
   Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly
browned and the candy has melted completely. For even baking,
rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to back
halfway through the baking period. Watch carefully toward the end
of baking to see that the candy does not start to carmelize and
turn brown.
   Allow the cookies to cool completely on the sheets. Carefully
peel off the aluminum foil.
   Store in an airtight container, between sheets of wax paper, at
room temperature. Will keep several weeks.

   Aryeh Levin doesn't quite know what his title is.
Israeli consul general? Israeli envoy?
   ``I'm the head of a diplomats' group,'' he said, chuckling,
``with the questionable title of ambassador.''
   Two years after his arrival and two months after the Soviet
Union said it would end its 23-year diplomatic rift with Israel,
Levin still waits to raise his country's white-and-blue flag at an
embassy in central Moscow.
   The Kremlin has said bureaucratic problems are delaying full
consular ties. Levin blamed the ``demon'' of anti-Semitism, which
he said pervades certain ministries and nearly reaches the top
levels of government.
   It's a perception that looms large for Israel and Soviet Jews.
Both hope to cultivate a deeper Jewish presence in the Soviet Union
even as tens of thousands of Jews emigrate.
   ``We need a developed Jewish life,'' said Leonid Stonov, a
prominent Jewish activist. ``We need to increase Jewish dignity.''
   Israeli officials and Soviet Jewish leaders said emigration no
longer defines their attitude toward the Soviet Union, as it did
during much of the Cold War. Cultural and religious expression for
Jews, and trade and social exchanges for Israel, now are nearly
equal to emigration on their list of priorities.
   More than 130,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated this year to
Israel, driven in part by increasing anti-Semitism. Several
thousand more have gone to the United States. About 300,000 Soviet
emigres already live in Israel.
   Of the 1.4 million Jews still in the Soviet Union, about 250,000
live in Moscow.
   Jews who remain can celebrate their holidays openly and attend
Hebrew schools in major cities. A new law on religion guarantees
the right to such practices, many of which formerly were
prohibited.
   Groups have emerged to promote everything from Zionism to Jewish
theater. Last December, 250 such groups formed the Confederation of
Soviet Jewish Organizations to protect Jews and coordinate their
activities.
   ``Our goal is to secure the survival of Soviet Jewry as part of
world Jewry,'' said Mikhail Chlenov, a co-chairman of the
organization.
   Anti-Semitism remains an obstacle. For decades, the Kremlin
painted Israel as a racist state bent on taking Arab land.
   ``In the realm of foreign affairs, where the general `new
thinking' is like a stream, there are little eddies on the side of
this larger current,'' Levin said. ``These little eddies are the
anti-Israeli attitude, the concept of a world Zionist conspiracy.''
   He said those attitudes had delayed restoration of full consular
ties, which would allow Israel itself to issue visas to the
hundreds of Jews who want to leave. The Dutch Embassy now
represents Israel in the Soviet Union and issues the visas.
   Israel and the Kremlin agreed Sept. 30, after three years of
warming relations, to upgrade the delegations in each other's
capitals.
   During that period, Levin arrived in Moscow and his delegation
moved back into the building it occupied before ties were severed
over the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Despite the announcement, the state of relations has not
changed. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman blamed ``slow-moving
bureaucracy.''
   Levin said ranking Soviet officials told him privately they must
proceed slowly because of ``an anti-Semitic mood.''
   ``They're using it as an excuse and they are at the same time
suffering from it,'' Levin said.
   He expressed optimism that full diplomatic relations could be
restored within a year unless anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic
elements prevail, Levin said.
   ``They all have their own Pavlov reactions to anything that has
to do with Israel,'' he said. ``They have to get rid of this, and
I'm glad to say they are thinking along these lines ... But it will
take time.
   ``People who deal with Israel today in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs are not Hebraists, they're Arabists. This does not explain
everything, but it goes a long way to explain a few things.''
   Vladimir Nosenko, a Middle East analyst at the Institute of
World Economics and International Relations, echoed that view.
   ``They have an old perception about the role of Israel in the
Middle East, and I'm afraid our bureaucracy is very strong,'' he
said. ``Our anti-Zionist propaganda several years ago created the
basic anti-Semitic problems we have now.''
   Israel hopes diplomatic ties will increase trade and cultural
contacts, Levin said.
   Nosenko said the Soviet Union needs Israel's agricultural
know-how. The two countries have exchanged visits by farming
experts, and Levin said Israel's agriculture minister would travel
to the Soviet Union soon.
   The confederation of Jewish groups is working to open synagogues
and may run candidates for the Soviet parliament, said Chlenov, the
co-chairman.
   ``There is a feeling that Jews were sitting in the far corner of
a big room, and only now they're trying to come out into the
center,'' he said.

<HEAD>Four Years Later, Walsh Still Prosecuting Scandal</HEAD>

   Lawrence E. Walsh ends his fourth year as
Iran-Contra prosecutor today fighting to preserve his most
important convictions and pry evidence from unwilling witnesses to
complete his investigation.
   Congress and much of the public appear to have forgotten, or at
least lost interest, in the biggest scandal of the Reagan
administration.
   But a grand jury continues to hear evidence in the case, and
Walsh says he will decide by spring whether to seek new indictments
or conclude his investigation.
   In the meantime, Walsh gets a chilly reception from the Bush
administration, whose hard-line stance on releasing classified
documents scuttled the prosecution of former CIA agent Joseph
Fernandez.
   He endures the editorial taunts of conservative commentators.
One recently compared him to a dinner guest who won't go home.
   His office is still dueling in closed court proceedings with
Oliver L. North over the former White House aide's refusal to give
more testimony to the grand jury.
   North scored a major victory earlier this year when a federal
appeals court set aside his three felony convictions for his role
in covering up the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of
profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The decision bodes ill for Walsh's other major triumph - five
guilty verdicts earlier this year against former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter, convicted of lying to Congress and
obstructing its investigations.
   Poindexter's appeal is set to be argued Feb. 28.
   And now Walsh is fighting a rear-guard action against Jeffrey
Toobin, a former junior associate of his office who wants to
publish a book about the Iran-Contra investigation that the
independent counsel contends would expose grand jury secrets.
Toobin has filed suit against Walsh in New York.
   ``I have never felt in the center of friends,'' said Walsh, a
former federal judge and Wall Street lawyer who is a month shy of
his 79th birthday but looks at least 10 years younger. ``This has
always been a lonely place.''
   But Walsh, who shuttles between Washington and his home in
Oklahoma City, said his investigation achieved its goal of
uncovering the wrongs of the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The central actors have been pretty well described,'' he said
in an interview, while acknowledging that ``the supervisory and
support roles may never be fully exposed.''
   When the investigation is over, ``we will have substantially a
full story, but there will undoubtedly be enclaves that aren't
fully developed,'' Walsh said.
   Eight participants have been convicted, including Poindexter,
North, former national security adviser Robert McFarlane and arms
dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   Just last week, Thomas G. Clines received a 16-month sentence -
the longest prison term imposed on an Iran-Contra defendant - for
failing to report on his tax returns all the money he earned
brokering the arms deals.
   The grand jury is trying to determine whether other former
Reagan administration officials could be prosecuted for misleading
Congress about the covert operation to arm the Nicaraguan rebels.
   These former officials include Elliott Abrams, a former
assistant secretary of state, and Donald Gregg, an adviser to
then-Vice President Bush and now ambassador to South Korea, said
sources familiar with the case who demanded anonymity.
   Walsh refused to comment on any aspect of the grand jury
investigation.
   He is preparing to ask the Supreme Court to revive North's
convictions. The appeals court had ruled that televised testimony
North gave lawmakers under a congressional grant of immunity may
have unfairly seeped into his trial.
   That ruling gives Poindexter powerful legal ammunition for his
appeal.
   Like his former subordinate at the National Security Council,
Poindexter gave congressional testimony on condition that his words
would not be used as evidence against him.
   Walshdeclined to comment on the wisdom of the congressional
grants of immunity, but he acknowledged they posed a major
stumbling block for his investigation.
   The Iran-Contra affair is most often compared to the Watergate
scandal that forced President Nixon's resignation.
   But Walsh said there are important differences that pose
different problems for his investigation.
   ``This isn't Watergate, where you have a burglary and a simple
coverup. This is a very complex operation at the very highest
levels of government,'' he said.
   Unlike the investigation by the Watergate special prosecutor,
Walsh's probe has never definitively answered the question of the
president's role in the scandal.
   But Walsh said the Iran-Contra investigations produced an
unprecedented collection of Ronald Reagan's statements,
particularly a seven-hour videotaped deposition the former
president gave for Poindexter's trial.
   ``It's rare the public has been given his own view rather than
the second-hand view of the investigator,'' Walsh said. ``We have
given the public the raw facts.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Tuesday the Pentagon has no evidence that Saddam Hussein is
planning any withdrawal of troops from Kuwait and is instead
pouring additional infantry into the occupied emirate.
   Cheney was asked about comments Monday by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that Saddam might try a ``ploy'' like a partial
withdrawal just before the United Nations's Jan. 15 deadline to
quit Kuwait. He said he did not rule out such a move but said
Iraq's military maneuvering indicated no pullout was in the offing.
   The defense secretary, en route to Saudi Arabia to discuss with
ground commanders U.S. contingency plans for war, said the
administration's resolve to restore Kuwait would not melt if Saddam
gave up some of the conquered territory.
   ``If he is planning to withdraw, we certainly haven't seen any
evidence of it,'' Cheney told reporters traveling with him before
his plane landed to refuel at Shannon, Ireland.
   ``He might move the pieces around on the board but our objective
is for him to get all of that stuff out of Kuwait, not half of it,
not 75 percent of it, not 10 percent of it - all of it'' Cheney
said.
   Cheney was accompanied by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, on their first joint visit to Saudi Arabia.
   The Cheney-Powell trip begins with two days of military strategy
sessions in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where the two will meet
with American commanders and ranking Saudi officials, including
King Fahd. Cheney and Powell then plan to split up for two days of
pre-Christmas visits with some of the 270,000 American troops in
the Persian Gulf region.
   Cheney and Powell conceded some of the reinforcements the United
States is sending won't make it there by Jan. 15, and that some
will arrive but still not be ready for combat, perhaps not for
weeks after the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Yet Cheney insisted ``we have an offensive capability should
that be required.''
   ``Most of the force will be there by then but obviously there is
additional work to be done before you would identify them as combat
ready,'' Cheney said, including testing equipment and getting used
to the desert.
   Powell declined to answer several specific questions about the
Pentagon's plans for war, saying he did not want to tip his hand to
Saddam.
   ``I want him to sit there in beautiful downtown Baghdad and
worry his butt off about it,'' Powell said.
   The joint visit will give Cheney and Powell their first
opportunity to sit down together with the U.S. field commander,
Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, and to assess the status of the
U.S. deployment less than a month before the U.N. deadline.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Wednesday
the U.S. troop level has passed the 270,000 mark, and that another
220,000 allied air, ground and naval troops were in the region as
well.
   Williams said the number of Iraqi forces in Kuwait and souther
Iraq continues to grow and now is more than 510,000.
   He said there were concerns raised within the Pentagon about the
security risks of a joint Cheney-Powell trip.
   ``But I think whatever considerations about that are outweighed
by the desire for them to spend some time together discussing the
operation and how things are going, spending some time with the
commander in chief of the operation,'' Williams said.

   Soviet Red Cross officials were caught red-handed
trying to steal parcels of humanitarian aid donated from abroad and
intended for distribution to the needy, sick and elderly, Izvestia
reported.
   The head of the Red Cross office in Moscow's Perovo District,
assisted by 10 women employees, had set aside parcels containing
sausage, canned meat, chocolate, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil,
macaroni products, cigarettes, ballpoint pens, toothbrushes,
dresses, men's suits and children's clothing, the government
newspaper reported in Monday's editions.
   Hundreds of tons of food, medicine and other aid has been
flowing into the Soviet Union from abroad in recent weeks as
governments and organizations try to alleviate some of the
shortages afflicting the beleaguered Soviet economy.
   The newspaper did not say which countries or organizations had
donated the goods, nor did it identify the Soviet Red Cross
officials involved. It also did not say how police discovered the
alleged theft.
   A court suit has been filed against the Red Cross workers, the
newspaper said.

   Increasingly, conservatives are dismayed over Bush's direction
and going public with their feeling that he has betrayed what one
of them, David Keene, calls ``the ideological base of the
Republican Party.''
   And increasingly they tell of hearing talk about running some
true-blue conservative against Bush in the Republican primaries of
1992, if only as a token protest. They agree, though, that there's
scant chance of denying him renomination.
   It isn't only the president's abrupt abandonment last summer of
his anti-tax stance that roils conservatives, although that rubbed
them the most raw.
   They also complain of the bill he signed to ensure the rights of
disabled people - which they say smacks of welfare statism - and
they point to Bush's program to reinvigorate the Clean Air Act,
which they see as just so much more social engineering.
   ``Just too much government,'' is how Tom Winter, editor of the
conservative newspaper, Human Events, summarized the right wing's
grievances.
   Even more, the chemistry isn't right. Keene, chairman of the
American Conservative Union, said conservatives feel that Bush
remains ``part of the establishment that most of these folks fought
for so many years.'' They chafe over the White House's ``cavalier
dismissal of (Ronald) Reagan and all he ever stood for,'' he said.
   And they resent the way the Bush administration treats
conservatism ``essentially as an interest group,'' Keene said.
   The president's latest moves - the installation of moderates
Lynn Martin as secretary of labor and Lamar Alexander as secretary
of education - are unlikely to win any applause in the conservative
camp.
   When William Bennett, a true conservative hero, changed his mind
last week and said he would turn down the offer to become
Republican national chairman, some GOP hard-liners assumed he'd
been shoved overboard.
   ``It took Richard Nixon six years to destroy the Republican
Party,'' Burton Yale Pines, vice president of the Heritage
Foundation, told The Washington Times. ``Bush has done it in two
years.''
   To test the depth of dismay with Bush, a reporter telephoned
conservative thinkers and read them this paragraph, written last
week by conservative columnist Joseph Sobran, also a senior editor
at National Review:
   ``Conservatives now spend most of their time trying to figure
out how, and with whom, to replace Mr. Bush ASAP. They dread the
prospect of his running again in 1992. Even more, they dread his
winning. Many of them would rather see even a liberal Democrat in
the Oval Office, on the principle that your enemies can't betray
you the way your friends can. And a Bush defeat would allow
conservatives to take back the Republican Party.''
   Those questioned didn't agree that they spend most of their time
conspiring to dump Bush, but they all had heard such talk.
   And all expressed dismay with the president's performance,
especially on tax and domestic matters.
   The about-face on ``no new taxes'' was the fulcrum of
discontent.
   R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor of the American Spectator, called
it ``a gigantic error.'' Patrick McGuigan, editorial writer for the
Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City, said it was ``capitulation.''
Winter labeled it a ``fiasco.'' To George Gilder, economic idea man
for conservatives, it was ``appalling.''
   ``When Bush abandoned that issue, he virtually destroyed the
party,'' Gilder said.
   The conservatives' complaint about Bush on taxes, said Martin
Anderson, domestic adviser to Reagan, ``is not that he didn't
succeed but he didn't fight.''
   Still, conservatives aren't ready to lead an all-out rebellion,
they said.
   ``Republicans are monarchists at heart,'' said Paul Weyrich,
president of the Free Congress Foundation. ``No matter how much the
king may be unpopular, they tend to stay with the king.''
   But, said Pines, ``If George Bush three months from now is doing
the same things that George Bush is doing now, then Sobran will
have turned out to be very prophetic.''
   Sobran's idea ``is not a majority position,'' said Robert Bork,
who was Reagan's rejected candidate for a Supreme Court seat.
   ``If Bush were defeated in '92 and Democrats retained Senate
control, they would have between three and four Supreme Court
appointments, probably, and that means you'd have 20 or 25 years of
an extremely activist Supreme Court and I don't think conservatives
want that,'' Bork said.
   ``You can't beat somebody with nobody,'' said Anderson, now back
at California's Hoover Institution on War, Peace and Revolution.
``Does Sobran have a candidate?''

<TEXT>
   The first ``Faust'' performance of this
Metropolitan Opera season failed to enthrall. One wonders if it's
partly because the scenery, new last season, grows on one in the
wrong direction.
   The sets, changing by revolving on the Met's turntable, make the
16th century look like a desert with adobe buildings and ruins.
   Neil Rosenshein sang the title role acceptably on Monday night
except for an irritating push on high notes that sounded more like
a shriek than a ring. Diana Soviero didn't stir one as Marguerite.
   Best were James Morris, a deep, rich-voiced, nimble
Mephistopheles, Gino Quilico, sounding warm and clear as
Marguerite's brother Valentin, and Susan Quittmeyer, even more
clear, as Valentin's friend Siebel. Quittmeyer, singing a young
boy, has a warm voice that doesn't spread its tone. It's a
happy-sounding voice that one could listen to a long time without
tiring. Off stage, she is the wife of Morris. He was the only
principal on Monday who sang his role when this production was new
in February.
   Thomas Fulton conducted, sometimes swelling the orchestra over
Rosenshein's singing.
   The lighting people were working doubletime as lighting effects
changed by the minute. There also were some special effects for
Mephistopheles, like a ring of fire and then smoke around him, his
shadow which moved differently from him in the church scene, and
blasts of fire during which he disappeared.
   Applause during the evening was polite rather than enthusiastic.

<TEXT>
   HAFR AL-BATIN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Elite commandos from the
Egyptian 3rd Army, which stunned Israel in 1973 by secretly
crossing the Suez Canal, showed they can survive on anything - even
raw rats.
   It wasn't surprising that the commandos successfully blew up
three houses Monday and repelled an armored assault in simulated
attacks against the Iraqis in the Saudi desert, about 30 miles from
the Kuwaiti border.
   But the eight commandos showed the real Egyptian mettle when
they tore into live rats, rabbits and chickens with gusto and ate
them raw.
   ``If you're behind enemy lines, if you don't eat, you'll die,''
an Egyptian officer told Lt. Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan, commander of
Arab-Islamic forces in Saudi Arabia. The general, swatting an
occasional aggressive fly, sat cooly in a chair watching the desert
survival feast.
   The meal started with a raw egg, quickly followed by a raw
potato. Then came a cooked egg, wrapped in soil and baked by a
blaze started with a rifle shot into a campfire doused with
gasoline.
   Out of a carton, two commandos then pulled a pair of live
chickens and proceeded to wring their necks. The commandos then
pulled each chicken apart, feathers flying, and stuffed them into
their mouths.
   Two live rabbits were skinned and similarly devoured. The final
course was live rat, minus the tail.
   ``I love it,'' Prince Khalid, a nephew of King Fahd, said when
asked how he liked the meal. ``That is a typical, standard function
or capability which any Special Forces unit conducts - even in the
United States, by the way.''
   U.S. Special Forces teams are assigned to all Arab and Islamic
forces under Khalid's command, but they operate in obscurity. Among
other training drills, the teams have been trying to help
coordinate U.S. air strikes with Arab ground operations. This was
put to a test in Monday's exercise.
   U.S. A-10 anti-tank aircraft swooped in low over the simulated
enemy column, which was also being attacked by Egyptian M60 tanks
and 155mm howitzers. But the American attack planes only made a few
passes, apparently flying off because they weren't expecting ground
explosions.
   The Egyptian and Syrian armies, both battle-tested, are
considered the toughest in the 110,000-strong Arab and Islamic
force deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   Egypt's 20,000 troops include the 3rd Armored Division and the
3rd Mechanized Division, part of the 3rd Army which started the
1973 Mideast War but was eventually encircled by Israel and forced
to retreat.
   Gen. Salah Mohammad Al-Halaby, the Egyptian commander, said his
troops in Saudi Arabia were Egypt's best fighters.
   Prince Khalid told about 1,200 Egyptian troops sitting in the
desert sun that the 1973 war ``restored the Arab dignity and
destroyed the Israeli security theory and put an end to the concept
of the undefeatable enemy.''
   After his speech, the prince and his entourage drove a short
distance to a carpeted tent for lunch. On the menu: traditional
Arab food of roast goat and chicken and potatoes and tomatoes
stuffed with ground meat and rice.

<TEXT>
   A battle between former Contras and
the Sandinista soldiers left 11 dead and 20 wounded in the
bloodiest such outbreak in months, the army said Monday.
   About 60 demobilized rebels seized a police post Sunday in
Jalapa, 125 miles north of Managua, Col. Antenor Rosales said.
   The army drove out the former rebels and captured 30 of them in
the fighting, Rosales said in an interview on state-run television.
He gave no breakdown on the casualties or other details.
   The Contras, who fought the leftist Sandinista government during
its 10 years in power, agreed to give up the fight in June after
Violeta Chamorro was elected to the presidency and took office as
part of a coalition.
   But the Contras claim Mrs. Chamorro has reneged on her promises
to give them aid and land, and strong antagonism persists between
the Contras and the Sandinista-controlled armed forces and police.

<HEAD>NTSB Says Captain's Fatigue Caused Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government safety investigators say little can
be done to force ship captains to rest, even as they ruled ``acute
fatigue'' a primary cause of Rhode Island's worst oil spill.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that the
captain of the Greek tanker World Prodigy had been on the bridge 35
consecutive hours when the ship ran aground off Newport, R.I., on
June 23, 1989.
   But the agency said there is little the government can do to
force ship captains of foreign-flag vessels to rest before reaching
a U.S. port.
   ``Hopefully what we can do is attenuate foreign ship operators
that fatigue is a major hazard to transportation safety,'' said
NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad. ``We see it in all modes of
transportation. Clearly we saw it in this particular accident.''
   The board unanimously approved a report detailing how ``acute
fatigue'' led Capt. Iakovos Georgoudis to make a series of dubious
orders and miscalculations in the hours leading up to the
grounding.
   The spill of 289,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil sent ribbons
of pollution toward the Rhode Island coast in slicks as long as
five miles. Shell fishing, swimming and pleasure boating were
halted in some areas.
   The NTSB ruled out intoxication, drug use or crew incompetence
as possible causes.
   Board staffers described Georgoudis as well-organized and
conscientious but said his sense of duty led him to overwork.
   Georgoudis told investigators he took several short naps on the
bridge but remained there because he was worried about the weather
and heavy ship traffic.
   He had sent subordinates off the bridge to perform routine tasks
and was himself distracted with cargo calculations as the ship
approached the shallow water of Brenton Reef off Newport, R.I.
   Georgoudis was off by more than a half-hour in his estimate of
when the tanker would arrive at its rendezvous point with a boat
carrying the harbor pilot and also made a slight but crucial course
miscalculation that sent the ship on the wrong side of a warning
buoy, officials said.
   The NTSB said the Rhode Island State Pilotage Commission
contributed to the spill by failing to require that harbor pilots
notify inbound vessels of exactly where they plan to board ship and
guide it into port. Had that been done, the board said, the tanker
would have waited to take on an experienced local pilot before
proceeding through the reef area.
   Vernon Dunlap, chairman of the pilotage commission disputed the
NTSB conclusion.
   ``The vessels are always told that the pilot will board,''
Dunlap said. ``The problem here was that the vessel arrived 45
minutes early. (Georgoudis) arrived at the pilot boarding station
and continued right across it.''
   Attorney Thomas Walsh of the Boston law firm Bingham Dana &amp;
Gould, which represents tanker owner Ballard Shipping Co., said the
NTSB appeared to be overplaying the fatigue issue. ``I don't know
where in the record there's any evidence of `acute' fatigue,'' he
said.
   The spill has spawned lawsuits against the shipper by the state,
boaters, shell fishermen and others seeking damages totaling about
$40 million. The suits have been consolidated into a single case
pending in U.S. District Court in Providence.
   Ballard pleaded guilty to federal Clean Water Act violations and
paid a $1 million fine. Georgoudis was fined $10,000.

<HEAD>Outgoing Mayor Says He'll Remain a Public Servant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, who leaves office next
month facing a jail term for drug possession, says he intends to
remain a public servant.
   ``After 30 years in public life, I will not change,'' Barry told
city workers in a farewell address Monday. ``I will remain in that
army of people committed to making a difference.''
   In a speech both conciliatory and confrontational, Barry also
warned against the evils of drug use and proudly outlined his
accomplishments.
   Barry, who is appealing his conviction on a cocaine-possession
charge and six-month prison sentence, said he is ``healthier today,
clearer today than ever before in my life.''
   ``We need to stop using cocaine and other illegal drugs,'' said
Barry, who has admitted to alcoholism and dependence on two
prescription drugs s well as occasional cocaine use. ``If we
expect our children to forgo illegal drugs, we must not condone the
use of legal ones ... like alcohol.
   ``I leave here with no regrets, but joy, and relief, quite
frankly, that we can move on to a new life,'' the 12-year mayor
said. ``We have fought the good fight.''
   Barry, who does not yet have a job, has been exploring the
possibility of a teaching position at the city-run University of
the District of Columbia, aides said.
   In a reference to the racial divisions that his arrest and trial
produced throughout the city, Barry urged residents of the nation's
capital to ``put our hearts together in love - love for our city,
love for our brothers and sisters of every race.''
   But the mayor also assumed a defiant tone in highlighting the
broadened involvement of minority-run businesses in the city's
contracting procedures.
   ``Some people don't like what we are about,'' the former civil
rights activist said in explaining his commitment to minority
contracting. ``We have opened up the door of government to people
who couldn't share in the process. ... That is a legacy no one can
take away from us.''
   And in an emphasis on healing political divisions, Barry also
pledged his full support and cooperation for Mayor-elect Sharon
Pratt Dixon.
   Barry was accompanied at the 45-minute speech by his wife Effi,
who moved from the couple's home to a separate apartment several
weeks ago.
   The mayor praised his wife as someone who has ``risen to the
occasion and has basically written the book'' on how to be a good
wife.
   Mrs. Barry, who is negotiating a contract to write a book about
her life with the mayor, smiled at that remark.

<HEAD>Economists See Fed Reducing Rates to Battle Recession</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Should stand</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, which has already eased
credit three times since late October, will reduce interest rates
further in coming weeks as it battles what may turn out to be a
worse-than-expected recession, many economists predict.
   These analysts, however, think the central bank will not move as
aggressively to lower rates as the Bush administration would like
because of lingering inflationary pressures stemming from the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The debate over how much and how fast to cut interest rates was
expected to be the primary topic today when top Fed officials
gathered behind closed doors for their final monetary strategy
session of 1990.
   The minutes of those deliberations will not be released for six
weeks, but in advance of the discussions, many economists were
looking for a fourth modest step toward easing credit.
   ``The Fed has to ease because the economy looks so rotten,''
said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm.
   While the administration still says it is unclear whether the
nation has entered a recession, economists said recent statistics
showing a big jump in unemployment and a three-month slide in
industrial production are unmistakable signs that a downturn has
begun.
   ``I don't think there will be a doubt among members of the Fed
that a recession has begun,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co. ``The debate will come over how much more to do in
light of what has already been done.''
   In the past seven weeks, the central bank has pushed the federal
funds rate down a quarter point three times, sending it from 8
percent to 7.25 percent. The funds rate is the interest that banks
charge each other for overnight loans.
   Many economists believe the Fed will signal a desire to push the
funds rate down another 0.25 percentage point but hold off doing so
until after the report on the December jobless rate is released
Jan. 4.
   That will give Fed policymakers time to assess other economic
statistics, especially reports on whether inflationary pressures
are subsiding.
   Some analysts suggested that the Fed may go further and cut the
discount rate, the interest the central bank charges to make loans
to commercial banks. A reduction in the discount rate is the most
dramatic signal the Fed can send of its intentions to ease credit
in order to boost economic growth.
   While analysts were in basic agreement that further small
reductions in the funds rate would be coming in the months ahead,
there was no consensus on whether the discount rate would be cut.
   Some economists argued that the Fed will be hesitant to cut the
discount rate while inflationary pressures remain at current high
levels. They said that overhanging all of the Fed's deliberations
is the threat of war in the Middle East, which has the potential to
send oil prices and inflation soaring.
   ``A war would be a very unfavorable environment for the Fed to
be trying to ease domestic interest rates,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer. He said the Fed will likely make only modest easing moves
until the situation in Middle East becomes clearer.
   Even if today's meeting produces nothing more than a small 0.25
percentage point cut in the federal funds rate, many economists
said that would be enough to prompt banks to cut their prime
lending rate from 10 percent where it has been stuck since last
January.
   That would be good news for businesses and consumers because the
prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than one-third of
fixed-rate and adjustable-rate consumer and business loans.
   Wyss said he was also looking for mortgage rates, which dropped
to a three-year low of 9.51 percent last week, to stay low but not
fall much further, perhaps dropping to 9.25 percent by early
spring.

<HEAD>Little U.S. Government Money in Aid to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's aid program for the Soviet
Union will cost U.S. taxpayers very little unless the Soviets fail
to pay back the money they borrow from commercial banks, officials
say.
   But a study due to be released this week concludes that massive
Western aid would be wasted unless the troubled Soviet economic
system is improved, official sources said Monday.
   Instead, the report recommends giving the Soviets help in
carrying out fundamental economic reforms, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The study, conducted by the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and two European-based development groups, comes on the heels
of a weekend summit at which Western leaders ordered $1 billion in
emergency aid for the Soviets and approved spending more than that
amount on technical assistance during the next two years.
   Last week, Bush promised a $1.3 billion loan guarantee package,
including up to $1 billion to buy U.S. farm products and up to $300
million to purchase U.S. manufactured goods.
   The Soviets have been scrupulous about repaying their debts,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said last week.
   ``Of course, we'd be liable if they default,'' Barbara Clay, a
press officer at the U.S. Treasury, said Monday.
   Under the program outlined by Bush, the Soviets would borrow
from commercial banks to buy the food and manufactured goods. The
U.S. government contribution will consist of a guarantee for those
loans: if the Soviets fail to repay in three years, the United
States would pay the banks 98 percent of the principal and about
half the interest.
   In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development will
coordinate medical aid to be provided by private organizations. The
agency may help pay the private groups' administrative costs, AID
spokesman John Riddle said.
   The Soviets have paid cash for billions of dollars worth of
grain and other food bought from this country.
   The Commodity Credit Corporation, the U.S. agency that
guarantees the loans for food purchases, said that without a
government guarantee the Soviets might not be able to get the loans
at all.
   ``Nobody wants to make a three-year loan on something that's
going to be eaten up in a few weeks,'' explained Deputy Director
Robert S. Simpson.
   The loan guarantees for manufactured goods will be offered
through the government's Export-Import Bank. The bank has not lent
to the Soviets since 1975.
   Bank spokeswoman Ann Frye said the loan guarantee would
encourage commercial banks to give the Soviet Union better terms
than it might otherwise get, including a break of up to 1 percent
on the interest rate.
   The study's findings, according to the official sources, were
pessimistic and depressing because they describe a system even more
backward than expected and practically paralyzed by inefficiency
and confusion.
   ``No amount of aid will make a real difference. The system
simply cannot absorb it. The pipe is so porous that very little
would reach its intended target,'' said Ilya Prizel of the Johns
Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
   Prizel said ``a political statement'' in the form of food aid to
help Soviets get through the winter might shore up President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev or even help induce the kinds of reform that
are necessary.
   But, Prizel said, ``what they need is technical assistance,
everything from entrepreneurial and managerial assistance to
logistical assistance, as well as traditional advice, such as how
to set up a central bank.''
   The Soviet currency, the ruble, is not traded on international
exchanges and its value inside the country is in a free fall; the
price of goods bears little or no relationship to the cost of
production; inflation is accelerating at a pace difficult to
measure; and manufacturing plants are almost universally old,
inefficient and unable to compete in world markets.

   Louvenia Lewis has been on the waiting list for a
subsidized apartment for a year. The Boston Housing Authority tells
her she'll have to wait at least 2{ years more.
   But Lewis, 52, a nurse's assistant and divorced mother of five
boys, doesn't have that much time. Because her job was cut to
part-time, her rent exceeds her income and the landlord is
threatening eviction.
   It makes her even more anxious to know there are 1,630
subsidized aparments in Boston sitting empty, largely because
there is little incentive to fill them.
   Public housing authorities get the same federal subsidy whether
their buildings have vacancies or not, as long as they promise to
fill them eventually.
   An estimated 1 million families nationwide are on waiting lists
for subsidized housing, and more than 91,000 subsidized apartments
are vacant - enough for nearly 220,000 people, or all the homeless
in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles combined, according to figures
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Many of
the apartments need only routine maintenance.
   ``It's a scandal,'' said John Donahue, a spokesman for the
Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. ``They have to open up those
places.''
   The nation's capital, for example, has 2,295 empty apartments,
enough to accommodate 46 percent of the 12,000 people on the
waiting list. Of those units, 1,697 are awaiting repairs.
   ``A small number of vacancies is normal,'' said Joseph Schiff,
assistant secretary for public and Indian housing at HUD. ``This
many vacancies is not.''
   Schiff said HUD is pushing for an end to subsidies for empty
units.
   In Boston, about 1,000 vacant apartments are awaiting
renovations.
   ``It's a case of deliberately not wanting to fix them up,'' said
Cushing Dolbeare, executive director of the National Coalition for
the Homeless. ``There are a lot of housing authorities that don't
want to house a lot of homeless people.''
   Housing administrators defend their handling of the vacancies.
   ``The problem is that when somebody doesn't give you the money
to fix the unit, there is no great incentive to do anything about
it,'' said Mike Nail, director of the National Association of
Housing and Redevelopment Officials, an umbrella organization of
public housing professionals.
   Boston housing officials say many apartments remain unoccupied
because applicants reject them. Some reject high-rises because they
are afraid the elevators will break down; others don't want small
efficiency apartments, which account for three-quarters of the
vacant units. Some shun public housing for fear of crime.
   ``Just because someone is low-income or homeless doesn't
necessarily mean they can be forced to take any housing anywhere,''
said Dale Mitchell, the Boston Housing Authority's assistant
administrator.
   HUD is urging an end to the practice of giving applicants a
choice of assignments, but the housing officials say that would
send the rejection rate skyrocketing and leave units empty even
longer.
   ``Public housing authorities are getting beaten up because they
can't fill these vacant units,'' said Nail. But he added, ``It's
like triage. When you have a limited amount of resources, you have
to decide how best to allocate those resources.''
   In the meantime, some groups have taken matters into their own
hands. Church volunteers started fixing up some of Chicago's 7,020
vacant apartments. In Boston, a non-profit agency has temporarily
housed homeless elderly people in 16 empty public housing units it
took over.

<TEXT>
   Stalinist Albania seems to have taken a
giant step by permitting its first non-Communist party, but many
emigres and others are skeptical the change is genuine or
sufficient to contain popular anger.
   Caught between a reluctance to relinquish a 46-year monopoly on
power and a desire to avoid mass violence, the Communist leadership
has sent a series of contradictory signals in the past week.
   President Ramiz Alia, who a month ago denied any need for
competing political parties, has now pledged that reform is
irreversible.
   Yet his government has to date kept all but a handful of foreign
journalists from reporting independently on the historic events in
his land. It has also so far failed to accord the new Democratic
Party of Albania legality.
   Appeals from the new party for calm appeared in official media
during last week's riots in four cities, but media have not carried
details of its program or profiles of its leaders.
   This puts the founders of the new party in a state of suspended
animation: working furiously on a program, yet under pressure not
to antagonize authorities apparently willing to take reform
seriously.
   The founders' caution has also bred suspicion.
   ``We don't know who these people running the new party are,''
said an Albanian intellectual who recently fled to Greece and spoke
on condition his name not be used.
   He noted that economist Gramoz Pashko, who has close ties to the
Communist elite, helped found the new party.
   ``Just as in Romania and Bulgaria, the governing party is
pretending to put on a new face to subvert opposition to it. The
people rioting on the streets are the real opposition to the
regime.''
   In a country of 3.2 million people run for decades by a small,
secretive elite, intellectuals have automatically enjoyed both
privilege and close ties with the leadership.
   Yet they are among the few groups with the courage and power to
organize in a country in which critics traditionally faced death or
jail. And the mystery that surrounds so much of what happens in
totalitarian countries means these intellectuals cannot be sure who
was involved in last week's violence.
   Some echoed official language, talking of ``dark forces'' and
hinting that what one called ``some kind of new dictator'' was
behind last week's riots in Shkodra, Elbasan, Durres and Kavaje.
   Ismail Kadare, the renowned Albanian author who defected to
Paris in October saying he despaired of seeing genuine democracy in
Albania, told the French newspaper Le Figaro last week: ``I fear a
counter-attack by conservative Albanian forces.''
   If there is a power struggle between old-time Stalinists and
reformers in the ruling Albanian Labor Party, last week's violence
could have been provoked by the conservatives.
   Yet popular discontent at economic misery and decades of
repression is so high that the protests likely were spontaneous
outbursts, particularly in industrial centers like Elbasan, a city
of 80,000 in central Albania with a huge steel mill employing some
15,000 workers.
   Elsewhere in the Balkans, similar mystery surrounds much of
politics. To this day, for instance, debate rages in Romania over
last year's ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Was it in fact engineered by disillusioned Communists and the
military riding a wave of popular protest to seize control
themselves, or was it the true result of a popular uprising?
   Even the legitimacy conferred by election victories on the
ex-Communists who took over in Romania and Bulgaria this year has
proved insufficient for them to forge the consensus needed for the
harsh economic reforms they recognize as inevitable.
   Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, opened negotiations Monday on
getting some opposition parties into the government.
   A coalition government is to take office in Bulgaria after
strikes and economic chaos forced the Socialist government to
resign.
   Albania's elections, scheduled for Feb. 10, will be a test of
the Communist party's willingness to accept democracy.
   Again, this puts the new party in an awkward position. In a
backward country with poor communications and limited resources all
controlled by the Communists, the Democratic Party faces an unequal
contest in February.
   Pashko said Monday that the new party has therefore asked for a
postponement of the elections. But that carries the risk of popular
anger rising beyond anyone's control.
   ``The reforms need to be realized in a short time,'' said Nedim
Vlora, an Italian professor of Albanian origin at Bari university.
   ``The situation is desperate, and when a population is
desperate, it attacks. It is essential that there be both economic
and political reforms.''
   Burhan Kalaya, who fled Albania for Italy three months ago, said
relatives reached by telephone in the Albanian capital of Tirana
paint a ``confusing'' picture of optimism about change and despair
at food shortages and other hardships.
   Such confusion prompts calls for the clear commitment to change
that Albania certainly must make if it is to meet the human rights
standards of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
it says it wants to join.
   ``If they want us to believe in their claims of change, let them
allow Christmas to be celebrated in religious ceremonies,'' said a
prominent Greek Orthodox critic of Albania, Bishop Sevastianos of
Konitsa, near the Greek-Albanian border.
   It is precisely such decisive acts, however, that seem to rankle
Communists accustomed to decades of absolute power who fear the
consequences if they let control slip from their hands.

<HEAD>San Francisco VDT Safety Law Wins Final Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's toughest law protecting users
of video display terminals went to a noncommittal Mayor Art Agnos
after winning approval from city supervisors, who called it
cutting-edge legislation for a high-tech age.
   Union leaders and victims of VDT-related injuries cheered when
the ordinance was approved 7-4 Monday. The Board of Supervisors
approved it 8-1 in a preliminary vote last week.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Becky Hogue, a Pacific Bell operator who
wears plastic splints on her wrists because of weakness from years
of using computer keyboards. ``I suffered so much, but now maybe
others won't have to go through the same pain.''
   The Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure, saying its high
costs would drive businesses away.
   The law would force the city and businesses with 15 or more
employees in San Francisco to spend millions to provide safer
workplaces for people who use desktop computers at least four hours
a day.
   Adjustable swivel chairs, glare shields, detachable keyboards,
tables with sufficient leg space and special lamps are among items
that would be required during the next two years. Violators would
face penalties of up to $500 a day.
   VDT users would also be allowed 15-minute breaks every two
hours, and an advisory committee would monitor information about
the health effects of VDT use, including those from radiation.
   ``This is a message to the nation that this is the next wave of
worker safety issues,'' said Supervisor Nancy Walker, who
co-sponsored the ordinance. ``It has to start somewhere, and
frequently things start at the local level since the federal and
the state have not been able to do anything, really.''
   Agnos said he supports the spirit of the measure but has
misgivings about its cost. He has 10 days to act, during which time
he plans to meet with business and labor leaders. If Agnos rejects
it, the board needs eight yes votes to override his veto.
   ``I want to sign VDT legislation that both labor and business
can hold up as a model. VDT legislation is an issue whose time has
come,'' Agnos said.
   The only similar ordinance, passed in 1988 in Suffolk County on
New York's Long Island and bitterly opposed by business owners, was
overturned a year later by a state court on the grounds that the
local government lacked authority to make such rules. That decision
is under appeal.
   City budget analysts estimate businesses will spend $31.5
million to $76.5 million during the next two years to comply with
the measure, while the city will spend $1.4 million to $6 million.
   Jim Lazarus, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, said
businesses need longer than two years to replace office furniture
that doesn't meet the requirements.
   The VDT Coalition, which represents unions, computer workers and
community groups, cited studies that show the law would save
businesses money through increased productivity and reduced
injuries.
   Among the problems associated with regular work at a computer
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neck
strain, eyestrain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nausea
and fatigue.
   One case of a wrist ailment known as carpal tunnel syndrome can
cost $70,000 when lost time and productivity are factored in, said
Laura Stock of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the
University of California at Berkeley.

   A child's shoe peeling away from its
2{-inch-high wooden sole, an abdominal truss, metal leg braces and
plaster body parts all hang in a small shrine here.
   ``I can remember, when I was real small they had all the
crutches, the braces, all around the altar, tacked up there,'' said
Albert Hattier, 61.
   They are offerings of thanks to St. Roch, who cared for victims
of the Black Plague in the 1300s and himself survived the disease.
The faithful left them at the National Shrine of St. Roch, built in
1875 after a yellow fever epidemic.
   The items include models of healed organs and braces and
crutches left by people who no longer needed them.
   Similar offerings are found in a number of European churches in
a practice that dates at least to the Middle Ages.
   ``These devotional offerings are a particularly Latin
expression,'' said the Rev. John P. Ford, a historian at Catholic
University in Washington. ``Other people ... will give a window or
a pew or a pulpit or candlesticks.''
   Catholic churches in many U.S. cities with large Hispanic
congregations have special rooms for such ``milagros,'' said
Leonardo R. Anguiano, a staff member at the Mexican-American
Cultural Center in San Antonio, Texas.
   Most often, he said, they are tiny silver replicas of arms,
legs, heads or other body parts. ``Sometimes they leave crutches,
sometimes they give thanks with a wedding dress, sometimes with
little baptismal outfits,'' he said.
   Those at the Shrine of St. Roch, situated in a poor and
working-class neighborhood a few blocks outside the French Quarter,
were moved from the altar in the 1950s during renovation to a tiny
room next to the chapel.
   The room is paved with marble tiles, most inscribed ``Thanks''
or ``Merci.'' A few tiles show the cured part: a hand, a leg, a
stomach.
   ``Thanks to St. Roch for my eye,'' reads the inscription on one.
   There is a 4-foot statue of St. Lucy, patron of people with eye
troubles, in her traditional pose: a quill pen in her right hand
and a pair of eyeballs - anatomically correct down to the optic
nerves - on a plate in her left hand.
   Hattier, whose grandfather was superintendent of the adjacent
cemetery and who was himself superintendent from 1953 to 1985, said
a second, full-sized statue in the room is that of a woman who was
cured after praying to St. Roch.
   ``I think she had arthritis or something like that,'' he said.
   Other hooks hold doll parts and feet, hands, a leg, an ear, a
breast and even a brain made of plaster.
   A tag reading ``Hector A. Boesch. Gratitude'' is pinned to St.
Lucy. A pair of eyes is scratched on a smaller tag hung with it.
   Boesch, 50, said his mother left the tags. He credited his
doctor with saving his eyesight after a scratched cornea became
infected in 1974 but said prayer may have helped him recover from
an aneurysm a year earlier.
   ``While I was under the knife at East Jefferson Hospital, the
doctors gave up on me,'' he said. ``I think ... the power of St.
Roch and some of the saints of my mother and grandmother who prayed
for me may have helped.''
   ``Personally, I think it's a little superstitious,'' said
Boesch's sister, Liz Miranda, 41. ``But if it makes them feel a
little better, why not?''

   For nearly three years, the Palestinian
uprising consisted mainly of street battles in the occupied
territories, a war of stones far removed from most Israelis' daily
lives.
   But a series of fatal stabbings on the streets of Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem has brought the Arab revolt closer to home.
   Growing fear among Israelis has prompted calls for harsh
punishment of Arabs who attack Jews. It also has renewed debate
over whether Israel should continue to occupy the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The independent Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth called this
week for a solution ``based on physical separation between us and
the Palestinians.''
   The leftist Al Hamishmar said legislators' calls for the death
penalty and massive Arab expulsions would only worsen the conflict.
   ``The only solution lies in a separation of the two nations and
a political settlement, which the government has been unable to
reach,'' the paper said in an editorial.
   Few believe the right-wing government of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is prepared to yield any of the territory captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Only recently Shamir
spoke of his Likud bloc's historic commitment to keeping all the
land from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River.
   But leftist Parliament member Dedi Zucker, who advocates trading
land for peace, believes growing anger and fear over the stabbings
are shifting public opinion toward getting rid of the territories.
   ``I can't remember in the last 10 years when my argument was
accepted so well among people that I meet,'' Zucker said in an
interview. ``They say, `Yes, there is no hope for us living
together.'''
   He warns that if a peace process is not launched soon, the
anti-Israeli attacks may accelerate.
   ``I fear in the coming year we may witness some horrendous,
horrible terror activity,'' Zucker said. It will be born, he said,
out of ``Palestinian desperation, a lack of hope.''
   From the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation, leaders of the revolt discouraged the use of
firearms and attacks on Jews inside Israel.
   But the guidelines began collapsing after the Oct. 8 riots on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, in which 17 Palestinians were killed by
police gunfire.
   The fundamentalist groups Islamic Holy War and Hamas, or Zeal,
have since urged armed revenge for the deaths.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said the massive use of live
ammunition by police on people armed only with stones had made many
ordinary Arabs feel restraint on their part was useless.
   ``Some people now feel they can cross the green line,'' he said
in a reference to the pre-1967 demarcation between Israel and the
territories.
   Since Oct. 8, seven Jews have been stabbed to death and at least
19 wounded in attacks by Palestinians inside Israel.
   Palestinian anger over the Temple Mount incident also has
strengthened support for fundamentalist Moslem groups, which
advocate the destruction of Israel, at the expense of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which has been pushing for a two-state
solution.
   ``I am hoping the Israelis decide to do something with a
credible organization that still has some weight or face the
possibility it will be left with organizations it cannot deal
with,'' Kuttab said.
   Instead of compromise, however, right-wing politicians have
responded to the latest attacks by urging even stiffer retaliation
against Palestinians.
   After Hamas claimed responsibility for the latest stabbing
deaths of three Israelis last week, the government ordered the
deportation of four Hamas leaders and the arrests of hundreds of
Moslem activists.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens promised that the deportations
``will not be the last,'' and Science Minister Yuval Neeman urged
expelling 1,000 uprising ``ringleaders.'' Others demanded banning
all 110,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel.
   Israeli military analyst Zeev Schiff believes such tactics will
backfire.
   ``Israel is still at the stage where many in the public feel
that an angry reply will solve the problem,'' he wrote in the daily
Haaretz. ``But it is clear that we are nearing a critical stage,
where more and more people will understand that it is impossible to
solve a civil war through military means only and that we need
aggressive political steps.''

   A winery employee who shot and
stabbed to death six relatives and a co-worker in a rampage last
year was sentenced to the gas chamber after a plea from his
father-in-law for swift and certain justice.
   ``Why drag this thing out for years?'' Robert Richards asked at
Ramon Salcido's sentencing Monday. ``He admitted he did it. He's
showed no remorse.''
   Salcido, 29, was convicted Oct. 30 of the 1989 murders of his
wife, mother-in-law, two daughters and three others in California's
wine country. He slit his daughters' throats and left them for dead
at a dump; one, now 4, survived.
   Under California law, the case will be automatically appealed.
   California has not executed anyone since 1967. About 280
prisoners are on death row.
   Richards, taking advantage of a California law that lets crime
victims address the court prior to sentencing, urged Superior Court
Judge Reginald Littrell to follow the jury's recommendation for the
death penalty.
   ``What a coward,'' Richards said. ``He ambushed a man, and
besides that he's a killer of women and children. What is that?
What kind of man was this?''
   Salcido showed no emotion as the sentence was announced. The
Mexican-born defendant said through a translator that the slayings
occurred ``at a time or a moment when I was drugged or intoxicated.
I do not recall what I did.''
   ``I ask everyone to forgive me for the things that I have done
and all the grief that I have caused the family,'' he said.
   Prosecutors said that Salcido was angry at his wife because
their first child was fathered by another man.
   Salcido was captured near his birthplace in Los Mochis, Mexico,
within a week of the slayings.
   The judge rejected a defense request to delay sentencing until
Jan. 17 to let Mexican officials prepare a request that Salcido's
life be spared under a no-death clause in Mexico's extradition
treaty with the United States.
   Slain were Salcido's wife, Angela; daughters Sofia and Teresa, 4
years old and 22 months; his mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards;
sisters-in-law Ruth Richards, 12, and Marie Richards, 8, and winery
supervisor Tracy Toovey.
   Only Salcido's daughter Carmina survived the rampage.

   Lamar Alexander, a former governor and
president of the University of Tennessee, may well be the man who
can make George Bush the education president, say those who know
him.
   Even detractors of his reform programs credit Alexander with
generating interest in improving public schools and higher
education in Tennessee, where as many as one in five adults is
functionally illiterate.
   Bush on Monday nominated Alexander, a 50-year-old lawyer and son
of teachers, as education secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, he
would succeed Lauro Cavazos, who was forced to resign last week.
   ``No governor in the country is so clearly identified with the
imperative to improve education in America,'' the president said.
He said the former two-term governor was ``at the forefront of the
movement to restructure our nation's schools.''
   Relzie Payton, president of the 42,000-member Tennessee
Education Association, praised Alexander's education efforts - with
some reservations.
   Bush ``evidently lacks the basic knowledge of what it takes to
be education president,'' she said. ``Lamar Alexander, I think, has
a basic understanding. He made education a No. 1 issue and it
became the discussion item on everybody's agenda.''
   ``For that we can say, `Hooray,''' she said.
   Alexander said that as education secretary he will work to
improve the nation's grade schools and training and adult education
opportunities for American workers who need new skills for the
changing workplace.
   Alexander entered politics as an aide to Sen. Howard Baker of
Tennessee and later worked as an aide in the Nixon White House. He
won the governorship on his second try in 1978, serving until 1986.
State law prevents a third term.
   He has been president of the 40,000-student University of
Tennessee since 1988.
   Education was the cornerstone of his second term as governor.
His $300 million Better Schools program, outlined in 1983, gave
teachers higher pay based on their education levels and
performance, expanded basic education curriculum, put computers in
junior high schools and added more math and science teachers.
   In 1986, he finished second to Massachusetts' Michael Dukakis as
the most effective governor in a survey by Newsweek magazine.
   Doubts now are being raised about the Better Schools program's
effectiveness, particularly the merit raises. A recent study also
suggested the program was biased toward whites and women. Ms.
Payton complained Alexander failed to consult her organization
before launching it in 1984.
   Alexander on Monday refused to state his views on a government
ruling that would deny federal funds to colleges that grant
scholarships based on race.
   But he noted that the University of Tennessee offers
scholarships to poor, minority students, and said, ``My general
disposition would be that when you're wandering through
constitutional thickets, that a warm heart and a little common
sense sometimes are helpful.''
   Praise for Alexander's nomination was quick and widespread.
   - Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, called Alexander ``one of
the best people in the country'' in background and understanding of
education.
   - Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said he hoped Alexander would not be as zealous as others
in the Bush administration in pushing ``school choice'' as the key
to reform. ``School choice'' lets parents decide which school to
send their children to.
   - Ernest Boyer, head of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said, ``Every signal suggests that not
only does he have strong commitment but a realistic sense of what
the priorities should be. It seems to me that he's looked at reform
more broadly. There is nothing in his past record to suggest that
he'd be narrow or ideological.''
   Alexander received a law degree at New York University and later
supplemented his income as a law clerk in New Orleans by playing
the trombone in a Dixieland band at night.
   He has known Bush since 1968 and was once touted as his 1988
running mate.

   ``Home Alone'' had first place all to itself
at the nation's box office, while the blockbuster ``Ghost'' drifted
out of the top 10 for the first time in nearly six months.
   ``Home Alone,'' a comedy about a twerpy kid left home while his
parents go to Paris, earned $11.6 million over the weekend. It has
been the nation's most popular movie for five straight weeks,
Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Monday.
   The film passed the $100 million mark Monday after making $99.3
million through the weekend. No film since last year's ``Look Who's
Talking'' has held first place for so long.
   Meanwhile, Robert Redford's ``Havana,'' set during the Cuban
revolution, opened shakily, making just $2.2 million for ninth
place.
   ``Ghost,'' the supernatural tearjerker starring Patrick Swayze
and Demi Moore, fell from the top 10 for the first time in 23
weeks. It was 13th, with $840,508, for a whopping total of more
than $200 million.
   In second place for the weekend was the poorly reviewed sequel
``Look Who's Talking Too,'' making $8.1 million in its premiere. It
stars John Travolta and Kirstie Alley and features the voices of

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
likely the next occupant of the Presidential Palace, is for Haiti's
impoverished masses a savior come to deliver them from their
misery.
   The 37-year-old priest has enormous support from the people and
has promised to sweep out tyranny and usher in an era of democratic
rule.
   But he is loathed by many of Haiti's traditional power brokers:
the army, the business community, rural landowners and Roman
Catholic and Protestant church leaders. Opponents see him as a
populist demagogue whose presidency poses the threat of a
theocratic dictatorship.
   Although official returns were not expected until late today,
international observers said Aristide was projected to win Sunday's
elections - the country's first-ever democratic vote.
   The priest has said his mission is to make life better for the
poor - the slum dwellers and peasants he has associated with for
years.
   He is slight, bespectacled and soft-spoken, yet capable of
crowd-rousing oratory.
   For years he preached to the poor from a church in the capital's
slums. He shared his feelings, telling his parishioners when he was
depressed, shedding tears publicly without shame. He operated a
home for street-hardened boys.
   He first decided to run for president to counteract the
candidacy of Roger Lafontant, self-proclaimed chief of the dreaded
Tonton Macoute militia used by the Duvaliers to terrorize the
populace into submission.
   Lafontant, later disqualified from running, calls Aristide a
Communist and has said he will block his way to the presidency.
   Born the son of peasants in the southern coast town of Port
Salut, Aristide was sensitized at an early age to the country's
stark poverty by the Roman Catholic Salesian Order.
   He joined the order in 1982, and was ousted in 1988 for
allegedly fomenting revolution.
   Aristide is an advocate of Liberation Theology, a belief popular
among Third World priests that the church should be involved in the
struggles of the poor.
   He remains a priest, but cannot lead Mass or deliver radio
sermons. Under Vatican regulations, priests cannot hold public
office and Aristide has said he would quit the priesthood if he won
the election.
   ``Jesus was not a priest. He was a man fighting for justice,''
he said recently.
   ``Aristide is the figurehead of a messianic movement, the
incarnation of a collective dream,'' says Laennec Hurbon, a
specialist on religious movements in the Caribbean. ``His
responsibility to his following is not the same as that of a
politician to his constituency.''
   Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist and former priest,
called Aristide a ``great communicator.''
   ``Aristide is a poet; nourished by biblical imagery, he is a
master of the vernacular Creole,'' he said. ``Unlike the other
candidates who told the people what they thought, he helped the
people express themselves.''
   Aristide gained a nationwide following from radio broadcasts of
his strident sermons against successive military regimes that have
ruled Haiti since Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled the
country in 1986.
   He has been the target of three assassination attempts, most
recently in 1988 when army-backed thugs stormed his Saint Jean
Bosco church during Mass and killed at least 12 parishioners.
   Aristide has not outlined a political agenda to carry out his
campaign promises.
   Playing on messianic symbolism and patriotic fervor, Aristide
has stumped nationwide. He calls his campaign Operation Lavales, or
``Torrent.'' Its emblem is the fighting cock, which represents
Haiti's coming sunrise.

<TEXT>
   Lothar de Maiziere, who a year ago led East
Germany to democracy and unity with the west, has resigned from the
reunited nation's first government following allegations that he
was once a police informant.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Monday there were
``indications'' de Maiziere and a man code-named in files of East
Germany's Stasi secret police as ``Czerny'' were one and the same.
   He said there was no proof, however, that de Maiziere knowingly
worked for the secret police of the former Communist nation.
   De Maiziere has denied the charges, but resigned from Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government as minister-without-portfolio and said he
would not be a member of Kohl's new Cabinet.
   He kept his seat in the new Germany Parliament, but resigned his
leadership positions in the Christian Democratic party.
   The resignation of the soft-spoken de Maiziere, who often said
he preferred playing viola to playing politics, illustrates how
hard it will be for the united nation to escape the repercussions
of East Germany's past.
   As one of Germany's truly historical figures, the man who built
and held together former East Germany's young, fractious democracy
is by far the biggest casualty so far. But he was not the first and
likely won't be the last.
   De Maiziere, a professional viola player in East German
orchestras during the 1960s, spent most of his adult life as a
lawyer under the old Communist regime. A deeply religious man, he
made a name for himself by defending concientious objectors and
political dissidents.
   He also was a member of the Christian Democrats, an approved,
relatively ineffectual party that received money from the Communist
government but put forth an image of independence.
   In November 1989, after the Communist hard-liners were ousted by
the peaceful revolt, he was chosen to lead the party as it tried to
remake itself in the image of its West German namesake.
   When the Communists agreed to free elections in March, de
Maiziere's party formed a coalition with two other conservative
parties and began advocating swift unity with West Germany.
   Another lawyer, Wolfgang Schnur, was chosen to lead the
coalition, but Schnur resigned March 14, four days before the
elections, amid allegations he, too, had been an informant for the
secret police.
   De Maiziere, 50, was hastily chosen to replace him and led the
coalition to resounding victory.
   After German unification on Oct. 3, de Maiziere was among four
East German officials added to Kohl's expanded Cabinet.
   One day after the election, new reports surfaced alleging that
de Maiziere had been a paid Stasi informant who even had an
identity card and a code name.
   The government said Monday the evidence was inconclusive, but
accepted his resignation. Schaeuble said the investigation would
continue.
   The Stasi had hundreds of thousands of informants who spied on
their colleagues in government, factories, offices and schools.
Non-conformists were harassed, intimidated and denied decent wages.
   Former Stasi agents often claim they should not be singled out
because virtually everyone in a position of influence or privilege
worked with them.
   Eastern German politicians have said privately that the Stasi
spent the waning days of Communist rule concocting false
information intended to implicate prominent people.

Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA can't keep its earthbound buildings in
good repair, according to a governmental report.
   The space shuttle's garage leaks; high voltage transformers are
corroded; one cooling tower collapsed from an accumulation of ice,
and faulty wiring caused a fire in a control room - all because of
poor maintenance, the congressional General Accounting Office said
Monday.
   NASA has given little priority to preserving its facilities,
most of which are at least 30 years old, and ``there is no standard
maintenance system within NASA,'' the study said.
   ``Many of NASA's facilities have not been adequately maintained
and are in degraded conditions,'' it continued. ``In addition,
several serious incidents have been caused by the facilities'
deterioration, including a fire and a steam line explosion.''
   John E. O'Brien, assistant deputy administrator of NASA, called
the report ``a useful assessment'' and said the agency is in the
process of correcting the problems.

<HEAD>Accord Could Double Emigration of Ethiopian Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marxist government of Ethiopia has reached
an agreement with the United States and Israel to more than double
the number of Jews it allows to emigrate.
   Under the agreement, reached last month in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa, President Haile Mengistu Mariam will allow up to
1,000 Jews to leave for Israel every month, officials said Monday.
   A previous agreement, negotiated by Israel last year after it
resumed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia, allowed 400-500 to leave
every month but was violated by Mengistu last summer. From July
through October, no Jews were allowed to leave.
   Israeli and U.S. officials estimate some 20,000 Jews are
stranded in Addis Ababa, after trekking there from their homes in
northern Ethiopia to escape famine and civil war and await flights
to Israel. Activists in Israel claim some 250 of their brethren
have died of disease and hunger while waiting.

<HEAD>Cuomo Attacks Capital Powerbrokers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo maintains the nation
is in a recession as a result of 10 years of Republican economic
policies and argues that only the federal government can spur a
recovery.
   ``The states have done all they can'' to raise taxes and cut
services, the three-term Democrat said Monday in a speech at the
National Press Club.
   ``Don't tell me it's hard. I know it is. But that's why you're
there,'' he said of policy-makers in the White House and Congress.
``It is not a lack of options. It is not a lack of ideas. ... It is
simply unwillingness so far to make the hard decisions.''
   Cuomo, who has been on the short list of presidential
possibilities for six years, said the nation failed in the 1980s to
respond to crack, AIDS, homelessness and an eroding education
system.
   He lambasted the ballooning deficit during the decade and the
annual interest bill country must pay on the $3 trillion national
debt.
   ``That's the part that gets me and most governors,'' he said.
``That's $200 billion that doesn't put a computer into the hands of
one child, doesn't fund one hour of research, doesn't provide a
single meal for one hungry person.''
   Cuomo said the supply-siders of the 1980s ``really did think
that all you needed was capital'' to create economic growth and
prosperity. He called those policies simplistic and unfair and said
they left the nation fundamentally weakened.
   ``It is time for the captain to change course,'' he said of
President Bush, adding that investment is needed in the labor force
of the future as well as in bridges, roads, technology and energy.
   Cuomo made a point of saying he supports Bush's posture in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``I do believe he needs to go to Congress (before starting a
war), but he has not ruled that out,'' the governor said.

   HBO Pictures has begun filming a movie about
former White House spokesman James Brady and his fight for survival
after being shot during the 1981 attempt on President Reagan's
life.
   Beau Bridges of ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' plays Brady in the
film, whose working title is ``The James Brady Story.''
   Crews filmed the assassination scene Monday, and on Wednesday
they're scheduled to simulate the presidential motorcade.
   Brady and his wife, Sarah, are consultants on the movie.
   ``Primarily, it is the story of Jim's and my family getting
through the trauma, more than the handgun-control aspect of it,''
said Mrs. Brady. ``But I think it will probably bring a lot of
attention to the subject.''
   Brady was struck in the head by a bullet that nearly killed him
and left him with permanent impairment of his mobility and speech.
Reagan fully recovered from wounds he suffered in the attack by
John Hinckley Jr.

   PARIS (AP) - Britain's Prince Charles, a harsh critic of modern
architecture, told French Culture Minister Jack Lang he admired
columns installed at the Palais Royal in 1986.
   Charles found the columns by Daniel Buren ``very beautiful and
very strong,'' Lang said Monday after he met with the prince.
   The contemporary-style columns have generated lively praise and
criticism since their installation. The Culture Ministry is at the
Palais Royal.
   ``The prince's taste is more toward preservation of the
tradition, but he has a certain receptivity to the modern,'' Lang
said.
   The two discussed the renovation of the Tuileries Garden in
Paris and the ambitious France Library project under way.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Conductor Kurt Masur, named in April to direct
the New York Philharmonic, will begin a season earlier than
expected.
   ``I am very happy,'' Masur, 63, said Monday. ``It means we have
no time in between to wait for something.''
   Masur, also music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of
Leipzig, Germany, and a guest conductor of the London Philharmonic,
was to begin in the 1992-93 season.
   Instead, he will conduct opening night next fall and the first
and third weeks of the season, which were to have been conducted by
Leonard Bernstein. He died earlier this year. Masur will conduct
nine more weeks during the season.
   Masur is here to conduct Mendelssohn's ``Elijah'' this week. It
was to have been led by Bernstein.
   Zubin Mehta, the current music director, leaves at the end of
this season.
   ``Until now I felt like a burglar breaking into the musical life
of an orchestra,'' Masur said. ``Zubin and myself are very good
friends but I didn't want to disturb.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - With the Joffrey Ballet $1.8 million in the
hole and attendance slumping, director Gerald Arpino was on the
verge of getting the ax, but he decided to wait it out for ``the
principle of the thing.''
   Wages were frozen, production costs slashed and fewer
engagements were made. Box office receipts have increased with
``The Nutcracker Suite.''
   Now Arpino has managed to reduce the ballet's debt to $800,000.
   ``Business is not as usual,'' he said. ``It can never be that
again because we now have recognition of our ideals.''
   Arpino founded the dance troupe in 1955 with the late Robert
Joffrey.

<TEXT>
   Pioneer 6, built to study the sun for six
months, is still doing its job 25 years later, offering critics of
NASA's whiz-bang ``superprojects'' proof that simple is better.
   ``After 25 years, we are relearning the importance of simplicity
and reliability, and the value of science as the focus of the
American space program,'' said Rep. George Brown, incoming chairman
of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
   The California Democrat spoke Monday as NASA and TRW Inc., which
built Pioneer 6, held a day-late anniversary celebration of the
spacecraft's Dec. 16, 1965, launch from Florida. Pioneer is now the
oldest operating spacecraft.
   The barrel-shaped $6 million spacecraft compares favorably with
``helicopters that fall out of the sky and amphibious assault
vehicles that sink,'' said Fred Wirth, Pioneer 6 deputy project
manager. ``The government does sometimes purchase things that work,
and Pioneer 6 is one of them.''
   The 140-pound spacecraft provides lessons for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, bedeviled by problems with
the Hubble Space Telescope, shuttles and other ``huge
superprojects,'' said Brown, whose committee oversees NASA.
   He said the simple-is-better view of the space program was
confirmed by last week's report from a government advisory panel.
The group said NASA must focus on unmanned scientific spacecraft
and put less emphasis on the shuttle, manned planetary missions and
the proposed space station and aerospace plane.
   Pioneer 6, which was 131.9 million miles from Earth on Monday,
``has traveled 15.4 billion miles without a single stop at a
service station,'' costing a measly four-hundredths of a cent per
mile, said TRW spokeswoman Montye Male.
   Pioneer 6 was built to serve as ``a solar weather station'' and
make the first detailed measurements of the sun's atmosphere.
   It collected information about solar flares, allowing the
government to protect astronauts from intense radiation outbursts
and to predict disturbances that periodically disrupt
communications and electric power grids on Earth.
   It also studied the back side of the sun for the first time,
measured solar wind speeds of 1.44 million mph, tested Einstein's
theory of relativity, helped track sunspot cycles and in 1973
measured the tail of Comet Kohoutek.
   To observe Pioneer's anniversary, a NASA tracking station at
Goldstone, Calif., tuned into Pioneer's radio signal for about 90
minutes Monday.
   A computer converted the normally inaudible signal into
rapid-fire beeping played at news conferences at the California
Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles and at Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, near San Francisco.
   In Los Angeles, officials also cut a big yellow cake, which was
frosted to look like the sun and had a Pioneer 6 model suspended
above it.
   Three of Pioneer 6's six science instruments still work,
although only two can be turned on simultaneously because the
spacecraft's solar power cells are wearing out. Wirth said he
couldn't predict how much longer Pioneer 6 will survive.
   Newer spacecraft have usurped much of Pioneer's value to
scientists, and it sends data to Earth only about twice a year
because of demands other spacecraft place on NASA's tracking
stations.

<HEAD>Hospital Medication Records Often Err For Patients Over 65, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital records often err in listing
medications that patients older than 65 were taking before
admission, posing a risk of serious treatment errors, a study
suggests.
   Sixty percent of records in the study contained at least one
error in listing ``important'' medications, and 18 percent had
three or more errors.
   The analysis excluded over-the-counter drugs, cold medicines and
medications applied to the body. When those drugs were included, 83
percent of hospital records contained at least one error.
   Mistakes in medication records mean patients may not be given
drugs they need, or they may get unneeded drugs that cause harmful
side effects, said researcher Dr. Mark Beers.
   He cited the case of a patient whose records failed to note she
was taking an oral diabetes medication. The drug was not continued
in the hospital until Beers pointed out the error, he said.
   Another patient was given a blood-thinning drug because his
record said he was on the medication, when in fact the treatment
had been stopped months before, Beers said. The error created a
needless risk of bleeding, Beers said.
   ``We found some really clinically very important problems'' that
could lead to complications, prolonged hospital stays and perhaps
even death, said Beers, of the University of California at Los
Angeles.
   ``I expected to find some errors, but the number of people
involved and the quantity of errors and the kinds of drugs involved
were much greater, much more serious than I had speculated,'' Beers
said.
   The study appears in the November issue of the Journal of the
American Geriatrics Society.
   The 60 percent error rate is high enough that ``I think every
patient and every doctor would agree that's scary,'' commented Dr.
Jerry Avorn of Harvard University Medical School, an authority on
medication use by the elderly.
   While most such mistakes will not cause any trouble, the high
frequency means ``it's just a matter of time and the law of
probability that some unpleasant clinical outcome is going to
occur,'' he said.
   Part of the problem is that ``physicians are not as preoccupied
as we should be with taking a medication history,'' Avorn said.
Another factor is that sick or injured patients are often unable to
give a comprehensive list of their medications, Avorn and Beers
said.
   Beers recommended that people of any age carry an updated list
of current medications with them, including the name of each drug,
the dosage and how often they take it.
   He also recommended that patients older than 65 be asked a
second time about their current medication use a day or so after
admission, by a nurse or pharmacist who can devote 15 or 20 minutes
to a thorough interview.
   The study involved 122 randomly chosen patients who were
admitted to a university hospital or a community hospital. Their
average age was 77, and all were older than 65.
   The work focused on older people because they tend to use more
medications than younger people, change prescriptions more
frequently and are more vulnerable to side effects, Beers said.
   Researchers checked records written by doctors at the time of
admission and then carefully interviewed the patients within two
days of admission to get their own list of medications for
comparison.
   For ``important'' medications, records for 52 percent of all
patients omitted at least one drug, while records for 22 percent
listed a drug that the patient was not actually taking.
   Omitting a drug not only means that a patient may not get a
needed medication in the hospital, but it also deprives doctors of
a clue to the patient's medical status, Beers said.

<HEAD>Report: Columbus Commission Under Financial Scrutiny</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the presidential commission
organizing the 500th anniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to
America says he has submitted his resignation amid questions about
his and the panel's finances.
   John Goudie, a Miami Republican and real estate businessman, was
quoted as saying in The New York Times today that he sent a letter
to President Bush announcing his resignation from the unsalaried
post.
   Goudie, who was appointed by President Reagan in 1985, denied
any wrongdoing.
   ``It's time for me to bow out,'' he said, adding that the
commision needed ``some favorable publicity.''
   There was no immediate word on whether Goudie's resignation was
accepted. White House spokesman Sean Walsh had no comment on the
report.
   A House subcommittee has been looking at whether the Christopher
Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission has awarded contracts
properly. Some of the arrangements under scrutiny involve friends
of Goudie's, the Times said.
   The congressional panel plans to hold hearings next year into
the running of the commission after an audit by the General
Accounting Office, the newspaper said.
   The 5-year-old commission is $600,000 behind on an agreement
with Spain, which has built replicas of the three ships Columbus
led to the New World, because Texaco Inc., a main sponsor, has
stopped its donations, the newspaper said.
   Texaco and Goudie said the money was halted because of a
contractual dispute.
   Goudie said he is resigning because publicity over the Texaco
incident has jeopardized a pledge from the Chrysler Corp.
   One member of the commission, Virgil Dechant of Hamden, Conn.,
said he knew nothing of a resignation by Goudie. Dechant said that
to his knowledge, the commission had no particular financial
problems.
   Another member of the commission, Mary Jane Checci of
Washington, also said she knew nothing of a resignation.

   Scores of volunteers climbed through fences into
vacant lots strewn with broken glass and searched rat-infested
alleys early today in Boston's annual count of the homeless - the
nation's only tally of its kind.
   Armed with walkie talkies, more than 100 volunteers set out at
midnight and combed 35 zones in a count that helps other cities
estimate their homeless needs. Another increase in the homeless
population was expected this year.
   Homeless people encountered by the volunteers were often offered
a bed or food. In most cases, the volunteers simply counted the
bodies where they found them in subway stations, behind trash bins,
on benches and roaming around.
   ``Hi, how are you? You wanna go to a shelter?'' Mayor Raymond
Flynn asked a women curled up in the doorway of an ice cream store.
Her puffed up face lay on a pile of possessions.
   ``No shelter,'' the elderly woman, named Suzy, replied, gripping
her blanket in the relatively mild winter night. Temperatures were
in the 30s.
   ``I see her there every night,'' said Flynn. ``She's mentally
ill. She needs medication. You try to get her to go to a shelter
and she'll get very, very violent.''
   Suzy was marked on a chart, just one in the dozen street people
he and three volunteers recorded in their zone.
   Flynn and other city officials said Boston is the only major
city to hit the streets for a head count of its homeless.
   Officials combine the count with a survey of hospitals and
shelters to calculate Boston's homeless population. The figures,
which will be tabulated this week, are used to lobby for money,
determine where to build shelters and develop services.
   ``We really make the promise no one will go without a shelter
bed,'' said Ann Maguire, executive director of Boston's Emergency
Shelter Commission, a city office. ``This is how we make sure we
can accommodate all of them.''
   In 1989, 3,830 homeless people were documented, an 11 percent
increase over the previous year. Currently, $3 million is spent on
beds and services for the homeless.
   Homeless advocates and city officials said there probably would
be an increase in the number of homeless this year.
   Maguire said the past four head counts have accurately portrayed
the homeless population.
   Last year, 128 men and 29 women were found on the street.
   `If we don't find too many homeless people on the streets, we
feel we're successful at sheltering them,'' Richarch Weintraub,
director of the city's three shelters.
   In a subway station, Flynn and the volunteers found a man in his
30s bundled in a coat and his arms curled around his head asleep at
about 1 a.m. on a bench in a passage. Asked if he wanted to go to a
shelter, he said, ``Leave me alone.''
   Another man was propped up on a bench sipping coffee, holding a
bag from a doughnut shop. Volunteers tried to get him to a shelter,
but the man was incoherent.
   Other people showed signs of drinking. An intoxicated man was
persuaded to enter a homeless shelter.
   Flynn's national Task Force on Hunger and Homeless is due to
release a major study Wednesday. The mayor said it will show
increased demands for things as simple as soup kitchens and bread
lines and is likely to show a dramatic rise in the number of
mentally ill homeless people.
   Flynn, a Boston native who knows many street people by name,
covered Zone 13 without the help of a map.
   ``See these little cots?'' Flynn, said pointing to a row of foam
rubber mats tucked behind a trash bin not far from the Combat Zone,
the city's red light district. ``They hide their clothes here,
their little goodies.''

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while share prices surged.
   The dollar closed at 133.03 yen, down 0.07 yen from Monday's
finish of 133.10 yen. After opening at 133.17 yen, it stayed in a
narrow range between 132.90 yen and 133.23 yen. Traders said there
were no new factors to move the market.
   Spot trading totaled a slim $3.6 billion, down from Monday's
$5.9 billion.
   ``It's difficult to sell, and it's difficult to buy. It's a
totally uninteresting market,'' said Katsunobu Motohashi, a dealer
at Yasuda Trust and Banking.
   With the Middle East situation still uncertain, market players
were playing it safe before the Christmas holidays, he added.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 24,424.02 points, up 336.11 points or
1.40 percent from Monday's close.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million shares,
up from the previous day's 277.8 million.
   Stronger bond prices and speculation that the Bank of Japan
might ease credit encouraged buying, traders said.
   ``People are starting to believe that short-term rates are going
to fall next year,'' said a dealer at a U.S.-based securities firm.
   The market's mood was boosted partly by the firmness of the
Nikkei index, which remained above 24,000 points despite selling
pressure Monday, traders said.
   ``The test now is how much we can stimulate the energy of the
market,'' said a dealer at Cosmo Securities Co, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 88.18 points as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Monday's 87.82-point close. Their yield stood at 7.030
percent, down from 7.100 percent on Monday.

<HEAD>Baker OKs European Talks With Iraq to Avoid War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said today that he would not object to Europe-Iraq talks on the
Persian Gulf crisis, and expressed confidence that European leaders
will accept nothing short of a complete Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   The European Community was expected to decide later today
whether to schedule a meeting between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz and Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, who would
represent the EC.
   ``We support all diplomatic efforts to try and resolve this
crisis peacefully and politically,'' Baker said as he entered NATO
headquarters for the second day of meetings with other foreign
ministers.
   He dismissed suggestions that such discussions would give Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein the impression of a split in the alliance
arrayed against Iraq.
   ``Those kinds of talks will not lead Iraq to think there's a
division when the message continues to be the same message,'' Baker
told reporters.
   On Monday, after Baker warned that Saddam might try to get the
world to accept a partial pullout from Kuwait, the NATO ministers
issued a communique saying they wanted Iraq's unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   De Michelis had planned a meeting with Aziz in Rome after the
Iraqi's scheduled talks in Washington with President Bush.
   But the Bush-Aziz talks, set for Monday, were scrubbed in a
dispute over dates for a subsequent visit to Baghdad by Baker.
   The Iraqi government has asked De Michelis to agree to meet Aziz
anyway.
   De Michelis refused to answer when asked about the meeting.
Other ministers, including British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd,
said on Monday that they would prefer that Aziz make a stop in
Washington first.
   The NATO foreign ministers' statement Monday said the gulf
crisis can be settled peacefully only by a ``complete Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.''
   ``We have not decided to go to war,'' Belgian Foreign Minister
Mark Eyskens said. ``We are all in favor of a peaceful solution.
The choice between peace and war is in the hands of Iraq.''
   All NATO allies except Iceland, Luxembourg, Germany and Turkey,
have sent ground, air or sea forces to the gulf region. Turkey has
reinforced troop deployments along its border with Iraq, and the
other nations have provided aid to the gulf force.
   On Monday, Baker told NATO allies that Saddam he expects may
pull some of his troops out of Kuwait by Jan. 15 - the U.N.
deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait - in an effort to
split international opposition.
   ``We need to anticipate Saddam's possible moves, be prepared for
a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our responses,''
Baker said at the start of the two-day meeting of the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Baker also appealed Monday for more military and financial help
to bolster the U.S. deployment in the gulf and economic aid for
nations suffering from the crisis, most notably NATO member Turkey.
   Turkey borders Iraq and has suffered millions in trade losses
because of the U.S. embargo against Baghdad.
   By mid-January, Washington will have deployed over 400,000
troops in the gulf region.

   School district lawyers headed for court
today to ask for dismissal of a lawsuit filed on behalf of a
8-year-old who has been banished to a classroom of his own for
refusing to cut his 7{-inch ponytail.
   Zachariah Toungate has refused for almost three months to
conform with school rules.
   School lawyers were to ask a state judge to dismiss a lawsuit
filed by the boy's parents, who say the third-grader should be
allowed back into class on the grounds the policy is discriminatory
because it doesn't apply to girls.
   A state judge earlier denied a temporary injunction that would
have allowed Zach back into class.
   School officials have kept the boy in an 11-by-13-foot
windowless room dubbed ``an alternative education setting.''
   He eats by himself, plays by himself, and, at a cost to the
district of $35 a day, is given a substitute teacher. He has no
physical education or music classes.
   Zach's grades haven't suffered because he is receiving
individual instruction and has few distractions, school officials
said.
   His mother said the isolation is wearing on him.
   ``It's getting real hard on him now,'' September Toungate said.
``He's real frustrated, but he says, `I want to keep my tail.'''
   School Superintendent Paul Flemming said last week, ``The
question is not hair. The question is, are you going to allow a
student to willfully violate a rule?''

<HEAD>Report: Computer Chip Points to Libyan Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer chip found in the wreckage of Pan Am
Flight 103 suggests a Libyan planted the bomb that blew the plane
out of the sky over Scotland, CBS says.
   British police discovered the evidence last summer while combing
through the fields around the village of Lockerbie, where the plane
crashed Dec. 21, 1988, the network reported Monday. All 259 people
on board and 11 other people on the ground were killed.
   The computer chip, lodged in the bomb's detonator, matched a
bomb part carried by a Libyan agent arrested in Dakar, Senegal, 10
months before the New York-bound Boeing 747 was destroyed, CBS
said.
   ``It was constructed and put together in such a way as to have a
Libyan signature to it,'' Vince Cannistraro, former chief of the
CIA counter-terrorism section, told the network.
   Previously, investigators suspected the bombing had been carried
out by a bomb-making cell based in Germany and acting on the orders
of Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   In turn, investigators believed Jibril was working for Iran to
avenge the deaths of 290 people aboard an Iranian jetliner shot
down in the Persian Gulf in July 1988 by the USS Vincennes.
   But investigators have concluded Jibril had to change operatives
when his German bomb-making cell was uncovered by German police,
and that he turned to the Libyans, according to CBS.
   The evidence, according to the unidentified investigators, is
the computer chip, which is different from those the Jibril
bombmakers were known to use.
   They used a switch triggered by the plane's altitude; the
Lockerbie bomb was a Swiss-made timing device of the type traced to
the Libyan agent, the report said.
   In addition, the Toshiba radio preferred by the German
bomb-making cell for concealing explosives was a single-speaker
model, while the Lockerbie bomb, parts of which were in the
wreckage, was a twin-speaker model, CBS said.
   The Libyan operative was spotted in Malta one month before the
Lockerbie bombing, CBS reported. The radio bomb was put aboard an
Air Malta flight there and later transferred to Pan Am 103, it
said.
   A Libyan connection was also reported last week in the London
newspaper The Independent, which quoted unidentified high-level
sources close to the inquiry into the crash.
   Asked about the Independent report on Friday, a spokesman for
Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, declined to
comment on what he called ``media speculation.''
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, Germany, changing planes at
London's Heathrow Airport.

   A man was convicted of killing another
man in a feud that began a month earlier when the victim belched at
him over the phone.
   Wayne S. Davis, 26, was found guilty of murder Monday by Circuit
Judge J. Warren Stephens and could get up to 22 years in prison at
sentencing next month.
   Davis shot Howard R. Helmick, 22, on March 22 while Helmick was
hitting the defendant's car with a baseball bat.
   ``He started it by burping,'' Davis testified. ``He stuck his
nose in my business.''
   According to testimony, Davis' relationship with his girlfriend
was souring when he called her apartment on Feb. 26 to talk about
it. A friend of the woman, Tanya Wright, testified that she and
Helmick, her boyfriend, were at the apartment and that Helmick took
the telephone and burped into it, then hung up.
   Ms. Wright said that a few minutes later, Davis kicked in the
door to the apartment and asked, ``Who burped on the phone?''
   She said Helmick admitted he was responsible, and a fight
ensued.
   Witnesses testified that over the following weeks, the two
continued to argue.

   Rescue teams worked today to free 10 miners
trapped underground by a coal mine explosion near the Mongolian
capital of Ulan Bator that killed 12 miners and injured at least
30, news reports said.
   The Mongolian newspaper Unen said the cause of Monday's
explosion was not known. A Mongolian Embassy spokesman in Beijing
said government investigators had been sent to the mine in the town
of Nalaikh, just east of the capital Ulan Bator, to determine what
caused the explosion.
   The embassy spokesman, who did not give his name, said 12 people
were killed. A source in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator said
rescue teams were trying to reach 10 trapped miners.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said a 32-member rescue team
from a Soviet mine in eastern Siberia was sent to assist in rescue
efforts.
   Xinhua said the coal mine is 60 years old, with an annual
production of about 600,000 tons.

   The dollar was mixed today in quiet, early

   A teen-ager convincted of hurling
rocks at passing motorists on the Capital Beltway last May has been
sentenced to 38{ years in prison.
   Prince George's County Circuit Judge William Missouri on Monday
sentenced John L. Burgess, 18, of Forest Heights, on a total of
eight felonies and 28 misdemeanors.
   ``You are young, and it grieves me now that I must impose this
sentence upon you,'' said Missouri.
   ``But it also grieves me that Destiny Morris will never rise
above the (mental abilities) of a third- or fourth-grader,''
Missouri said.
   Miss Morris, now 16, was among 30 people in 24 vehicles who were
injured in the May 27 attack. Once a promising artist, she has
undergone intensive threatment and therapy since the attack. She
returned to her home this month.
   Burgess, who could have been sentenced to a maximum of 415
years, confessed that he two others threw dozens of rocks at
motorists for fun.
   Another youth, Donnell Petite, also has been convicted in the
case, and a third, Maurice Ford, will stand trial in February.

   Reputed Mafia boss John Gotti paid off a police
officer for a tip that authorities had bugged the office of a Gotti
cohort, police say.
   Detective William J. Peist, 43, was stripped of his shield and
guns and put on desk duty after refusing to cooperate with the FBI,
police said Monday.
   Peist faces departmental charges for failing to cooperate. No
criminal charges were immediately filed.
   Meanwhile, the judge in Gotti's racketeering case Monday
postponed until Friday a bail hearing while he considers a defense
request to close the hearing to the public.
   Prosecutors have said six tapes made from listening devices
planted in the Ravenite Social Club in Little Italy, one of Gotti's
hangouts, will show that the so-called Dapper Don is a threat to
the community and does not deserve bail.
   In a letter to U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser, defense
attorney Gerald L. Shargel claimed Gotti's rights to privacy and a
fair trial would be violated if the tapes were played in open
court.
   The New York Post reported Monday that one of the tapes revealed
that Gotti paid at least $10,000 to a police officer for tipping
him off to another wiretap.
   Federal agents recorded a conversation between Gotti and
co-defendants Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano and Frank
``Frankie Locks'' Locascio during which they agreed to bribe a
public servant, authorities said.
   Peist, a 16-year-veteran with four departmental awards, passed a
tip that police had bugged Gravano's S&amp;G Construction Co., police
said.
   Gotti, Gravano and Locascio were arrested last week and charged
under federal racketeering statutes with murder, gambling,
loansharking, obstruction of justice and other crimes. All three
were being held in jail.
   Gotti is accused of ordering the 1985 assassination of his
predecessor, ``Big Paul'' Costellano, to take over the Gambino
crime family, which prosecutors describe as the nation's most
powerful criminal organization.
   A fourth defendant, Thomas Gambino, was arrested on loansharking
and gambling charges and freed on bail.

effect.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell Monday in northern and western Iowa.
Authorities blamed the weather for one fatal traffic accident.
Hundreds of travelers were stranded because of hazardous road
conditions.
   Thunderstorms were forecast for the South, with snow flurries
and rain in the Midwest. Heavy rain was forecast from the Great
Lakes to New England.
   Sunny skies and mild temperatures were forecast from Southern

   Iraq's health minister claimed today that
2,042 children under age 5 have died because of shortages in baby
food and medicines brought on by the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade
with his country.
   The minister, Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said, blamed President Bush
for the deaths in a statement distributed by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
   ``Documented evidence of this high rate in childrens' death will
stand to condemn the crimes committed by Bush and his partners,''
INA quoted the minister as saying.
   He said 600 of the children died in hospitals this month, mainly
due to shortages of vaccines that caused the spread of contagious
diseases like measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
   Said claimed on Dec. 3 that 1,416 children had died because of
shortages resulting from the sanctions the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Iraq as punishment for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad have discounted the reports of
shortages, noting that the Security Council decided in October to
allow shipments of essential food and medicines to Iraq.
   The diplomats note that since mid-October, nearly 120 tons of
medicines have arrived from humanitarian groups worldwide,
earmarked for Iraqi children.
   Most of the shipments were in exchange for Western hostages
helped by Iraq until President Saddam Hussein announced a blanket
release on Dec.6.
   Last week alone, Iraq's Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of
the Red Cross, announced it had received a shipment of 22 tons of
medical supplies from the Italy and another 28 tons of the same
from the United Nations' Children Fund, UNICEF.
   But government hospitals still report shortages of vaccines,
antibiotics and baby formulas and tell patients they should bring
their own.
   Iraqis say they can buy medicines at pharmacies and on the black
market but the prices are at least five times higher than normal.
   Some diplomats and medical personnel in Baghdad suggested last
month that Iraq might be stockpiling medicine in case of war and
that some of the reported shortages resulted from profiteering.
   A government rationing plan enforced in September limits each
child under age 1 to three 16-ounce cans of baby formula a month.
At government subsidized stores, each can costs 750 fils, or 2.25
dollars at the official exchange rate.
   Iraqis are forced to supplement their babies' diet with powdered
milk bought on the black market for as much as 40 dinars per
kilogram (2,2 pounds).
   That price amounts to $120 at the official rate and is beyond
the means of many Iraqis.

<HEAD>U.S. Accepts a Resolution Critical of Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council has for a
seventh time postponed voting on a resolution deploring Israel's
deportation of Palestinians from the occupied territories.
   But the United States, which had stifled any resolution linking
the Palestinians to a Middle East peace conference or assailing
Israel too harshly, agreed during debate Monday to support a
carefully critical proposal.
   Council President Abdalla Saleh Al-Ashtal of Yemen said he was
not certain which of several amended resolutions might be put to a
vote Wednesday, when the council meets on the issue again.
   He said various Western and non-aligned drafts would have to
first be reconciled.
   The resolutions under consideration also call for an
international conference to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The postponements of the votes over the past two weeks have
largely been the doing of the United States, which fears its
support for a peace conference would be seen as a concession to
induce Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Iraq insists it will not consider pulling out unless Israel
moves to relinquish the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it
seized during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel's decision last week to deport four Palestinian leaders
of an extremist group apparently pushed the United States closer to
the position of Security Council members who want to improve the
safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   The deported Palestinians were leaders of a group that claimed
responsibility for murdering three Israeli civilians outside Tel
Aviv. But many Palestinians say they prefer death to deportation
from the land they call their own. Saturday's deportations order
were Israel's first in over a year.
   The U.S.-backed draft resolution ``deplores the decision by the
government of Israel, the occupying power, to resume deportation of
Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories.''
   It also requests the U.N. secretary-general urgently monitor the
safety of Palestinian civilians and make new efforts to help them.
   It was not immediately clear whether the proposal goes far
enough to satisfy the council's strongest Palestinian supporters.
   Another proposal under consideration states that an
international peace conference on the Middle East, properly
structured and at an appropriate time, could promote a
comprehensive settlement. The United States has indicated it would
support a carefully arranged conference at an unspecified time.
   Israel has rejected any deployment of U.N. personnel in the
Israeli-occupied territories as an infringement upon its
sovereignty.
   It has also rejected most proposals for an international
conference on the Mideast situation.

   Thousands of reservists reported to their
army units today in a mass mobilization begun a day after Iraq's
rulers declared once again that they would never surrender Kuwait.
   ``We are ready for the decisive showdown, if thus God wills. But
many heads will roll and many thrones will fall,'' said a statement
from the ruling Revolutionary Command Council.
   The Defense Ministry on Monday ordered all able-bodied
33-year-old reservists to report for duty by Thursday for short
training periods before being assigned to ``active duty.''
   The reservists began reporting today, according to officials at
mobilization centers.
   President Saddam Hussein said last month that he would call up
some 250,000 reservists. Most of the country's 230,000 other
reservists had already been activated following the Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   Monday's move was Iraq's third major callup of reserves in
recent weeks. Men aged 30-32 were ordered to report for military
duty last month, as were 60,000 farmers who had earlier been
exempted to help boost food production to counter United
Nations-imposed trade sanctions against Iraq.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
estimates that Iraq has 904,000 men ages 18-22 and 1.3 million in
the 23-32 age group.
   Saddam has placed an estimated 500,000 men in the Kuwait theater
facing a 28-nation, U.S.-dominated force that by mid-January is
expected to total around 650,000 men and women.
   Iraq's regular army has 500,000 soldiers, some of whom are
deployed on its borders with Turkey and Syria.
   The United Nations Security Council last month ordered Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face military action.
   In its statement Monday, the government said it wanted peace but
would not capitulate to Western demands to abandon Kuwait
unconditionally.
   Iraqi authorities have intensified preparations for war in the
last couple of weeks, ordering owners of buildings to provide bomb
shelters and expanding first-aid and civil defense training.
   The state-run al-Jomhuriya daily said Monday that civil defense
authorities have opened 342 training centers in the capital of 4
million people.

<HEAD>Millions of Dollars Wasted by City on Office Rentals.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Offices that will cost the financially
strapped city government $1.2 million a month barely will be used
Philadelphia's comptroller says.
   The city, which may miss a payroll payment in 10 days unless it
gets a cash infusion, in January is taking over 600,000 square feet
of space it agreed to rent three years ago in a deal to keep Cigna
Corp. from leaving the city.
   Jonathan Saidel, Philadelphia's comptroller, said the city plans
to fill only 12,323 square feet - about 2 percent - in the two
office buildings the company has vacated.
   ``We found that much of the $1.2 million monthly rental payment
for the Cigna space will simply be a waste of taxpayers' money
since the city has no effective plans for moving city departments
into the space as it becomes available,'' Saidel said in an audit
released last week.
   Saidel, accusing city administrators of ``grossly inadequate''
handling of office space costs, said lease costs for the city have
skyrocketed.
   The city budgeted $36.6 million for rent in the 1991 budget year
- up 56 percent from the $23.4 million of fiscal 1990 and more than
six times the total rent of $5.4 million in fiscal 1980.
   The report said the city's system and procedures for renting
office space were in disarray and millions of dollars are wasted
each year on rent.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode did not immediately respond to a request
through his press secretary for comment on the audit.
   Public Property Commissioner Andres Perez Jr. was not in his
office Monday and unavailable for comment, a secretary said.
   Philadelphia has overspent its $2.1 billion budget by some $240
million this year. Unless it receives a cash infusion, the city has
warned it will not meet its payroll as early as Dec. 28.

<HEAD>Japan Offers $108 Million in Aid to Soviets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan today announced a $108 million package of
emergency food and medical aid to the Soviet Union, but stressed
that its policy of withholding ordinary assistance from Moscow
remains unchanged.
   Japan is making its first offer of food aid to the Soviet Union
as a humanitarian gesture, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said.
   A longstanding dispute over the ownership of small islands off
northern Japan has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from signing a treaty
to formally end World War II hostilities. Japan has been reluctant
to extend aid to the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Japan's basic
position on economic assistance to the Soviet Union remains
unchanged but that humanitarian aid is being offered because the
``situation is deteriorating very rapidly.''
   The package consists of $3.8 million in food aid and an equal
amount in medical aid, both to be delivered through the Red Cross;
up to $100 million in food credits through the Export-Import Bank
of Japan and government tax support for organizations that help the
Soviet Union, the Foreign Ministry said.
   The ministry had delayed deciding on food aid because of reports
of a bumper Soviet harvest. But Watanabe acknowledged that problems
with transportation and organization had created food distribution
problems.
   Indeed, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama expressed concern Tuesday
that food from Japan would not reach its intended destination.
   ``We would like to ask Soviet authorities for cooperation to
make sure our assistance will properly reach the destination,'' he
said.
   Kazuhiko Togo, the head of the Foreign Ministry's Soviet
Division, said the government had a tough time deciding on the aid
plan because of the political strains between the nations.
   ``Where to draw a line between humanitarian aid and ordinary aid
was a very difficult decision,'' he said.
   The European Community has pledged $2.8 billion in aid to the
Soviets, and the United States will extend the Soviets $1 billion
in agricultural credits.

   Mary Christmas says it wouldn't be
a merry Christmas without a little merriment about her holiday
moniker.
   ``It's a good conversation piece and I never get tired of people
laughing about my name,'' said the 38-year-old mother of three.
   Sometimes, however, her name can get her in a pickle.
   For example, phone conversations can became more than a bit
twisted when she picks up at the Horry County Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Commission.
   ``I've had several people hang up on me in the last week,'' Mrs.
Christmas said. ``But once they find out my name really is Mary
Christmas, they never forget it.''
   Her 13-year-old daughter, also named Mary Christmas, also said
the name is cause for unwanted attention.
   ``All my teachers call on me to do stuff for them because they
can't remember anyone else's name,'' the eighth-grader complained.
   There are other drawbacks, too.
   ``One time a woman wouldn't cash my check. She refused to
believe anyone could have the name Mary Christmas,'' Mrs. Christmas
said.
   ``And this time of year it's particularly strange because people
call out `merry Christmas' and I'm constantly turning around to see
what they want.''
   Mary Christmas was not always Mary Christmas. She was Mary Alice
Allen until 18 years ago when she married Kent Christmas, who works
at a local car dealership.
   ``At first, I never really thought about it because my friends
usually called me `Mary Alice,''' she said. ``Then, other people
started calling me Mary Christmas and it stuck. No one ever just
calls me `Mary.' It's always `Mary Christmas.'''

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Says Two Largest Defense Firms Could Go Bankrupt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon audits revealed McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. have a ``possible chance of
bankruptcy,'' a newspaper reported today.
   The financial health of the nation's two largest defense
contractors has been debated privately all year, but the September
audits by the Defense Contract Audit Agency are the first official
word on the subject, according to the Los Angeles Times.
   The Pentagon's accountants found that the financial condition of
the two firms had deteriorated this year, but their ability to
complete projects under contract was not impaired.
   A General Dynamics spokesman told the Times he had not seen the
audit, but said, ``It is unfortunate that matters related to that
were leaked at this particular time.''
   McDonnell Douglas' chief financial officer, Herbert Lanese, said
any prediction of bankruptcy was ``ludicrous.'' The company also
discredited the criteria on which the Pentagon made its
conclusions.
   The formula in question is the ``z-score,'' a weighted average
of ratios that considers sales, operating profits, retained
earnings and working capital as a percentage of total assets, and
market value of stock as a percentage of total debt.
   Auditors gave McDonnell Douglas a z-score of 2.27, or a
``possible chance of bankruptcy.'' A score of 1.8 or lower means a
``probable chance of bankruptcy.''
   General Dynamics got a score of 2.42, also indicating a
``possible chance of bankruptcy,'' according to the audit.
   Private defense industry experts also questioned the Pentagon's
findings.
   ``If I had to rely on the government for my financial analysis,
I would be in a lot of trouble,'' said aerospace analyst Howard
Rubel of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. ``One of the problems that
exists in any form of government second-guessing is that they don't
understand what they are doing.''
   McDonnell Douglas does have two debt-laden projects: the C-17
cargo jet, which is exceeding its contract ceiling by $600 million,
and the A-12 attack jet, facing an overrun of $500 million.

   A 2-month-old baby trapped in a burning
apartment house was saved by two quick-thinking passersby who used
a trenchcoat to catch the infant after her mother dropped her out
of a fourth-floor window.
   The baby, Amanda Morales, fell 40 feet into the arms of Bruce
and Karen Pane, a brother and sister who were driving by the house
in Brooklyn Monday morning when they heard the young mother
screaming for help.
   The pair used Karen Pane's coat to catch the baby, who escaped
serious injury.
   ``There's no way you can blow a catch like that,'' said Bruce
Pane, 35, an avid softball and touch football player. ``I've made a
lot of pressure catches, but none with that much pressure on it.''
   The mother, Susan Seymour, 20, then staggered away from the
window and collapsed.
   Firefighter Chris Gafney climbed a flame-engulfed ladder,
crawled through smoke to find her, and brought her out. Seymour was
in critical but stable condition today with smoke inhalation and
second-degree burns over less than 5 percent of her body, said a
New York Hospital spokesman.
   Amanda was in satisfactory condition for treatment of smoke
inhalation, said a spokeswoman for Methodist Hospital.
   ``I feel so high. I really feel good about what we've done,''
said Karen Pane, 32.

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia has approved the most
far-reaching gun control bill in the nation, a measure to make
manufacturers and dealers liable for deaths and injuries caused by
semiautomatic weapons.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. said today he has signed the bill, which
cannot become law until reviewed by Congress.
   ``I think we have to take all measures to try to get the guns
off the streets of America,'' Barry said on WTTG-TV's Fox Morning
News. ``The manufacturer has to begin to take some of the weight.
We don't need those guns on the streets.''
   Barry said everybody who touches guns used in homicides should
be held liable.
   The measure, which was approved by the city council last week,
would give private citizens the right to sue for damages from
manufacturers and sellers of semiautomatic weapons, regardless of
where the makers and dealers do business.
   ``It's time for these merchants of death to pay a price,'' said
council member William Lightfoot, who co-sponsored the bill. ``We
can set a very meaningful precedent.''
   Officials in Washington, which has the nation's highest homicide
rate, say that since January 1988 about 70 percent of the 8,500
guns recovered by police have been traced to dealers in neighboring
Maryland and Virginia.
   The bill will face strong opposition from the National Rifle
Association when it arrives in Congress for a 30-day review period
that begins when Congress returns to legislative business Jan. 23.
   Congress normally lets new city laws stand, but controversial
measures sometimes become platforms for ideological debate and are
defeated.
   A lobbyist for the NRA, Carl T. Rowan Jr., called the bill
``frivolous'' and said it would ``not have any impact on the
violence. I don't think it stands a chance in court.''
   The NRA was instrumental earlier this year in the defeat of
three congressional proposals to ban semiautomatic weapons.
   Michael Beard, president of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
said he believes the bill would survive a court challenge, although
no real precedent exists.
   A top aide to Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the House
District of Columbia Committee, said Dellums would support the
measure. But the office of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who
also is on the committee, said letting such a law stand would be
``unconscionable.''
   President Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, has said the White
House also will look at the matter.
   The bill is based on product-liability law, which allows
individuals to seek monetary damages for death or injury to
themselves or family members caused by a particular product.
   In such cases, juries or judges decide the amount of damages
after a trial on the individual's lawsuit.
   The city already has one of the strictest gun laws in the
country. Sales are banned and private citizens are prohibited from
owning weapons unless they were purchased and registered before
1976.
   Still, the murder toll keeps climbing, from 369 two years ago to
434 in 1989 and 465 with just 14 days left in 1990.
   ``By damn, it's time to stand up,'' said council Chairman David
Clarke, who co-sponsored the bill. ``If we can begin to take the
profit out of the gun trade, it will have an effect on our lives.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of former Contras seized a
police post and battled the Sandinista army in fighting that
claimed 11 lives and left 20 people wounded, the highest casualty
toll during Violeta Chamorro's presidency.
   The violence occurred as Mrs. Chamorro prepared to veto a 25
percent cut in the military budget that the Sandinista People's
Army said would push Nicaragua into ``chaos and a bloodbath.''
   Col. Antenor Rosales said the fighting took place Sunday when 60
rebels seized a police post in Jalapa, 125 miles north of Managua.
The army put down the uprising and captured more than half the
former Contras, he said in a interview on state-run television.
   Eleven people were killed and 20 wounded, Rosales said. He did
not say how many of the dead and wounded were former Contras.
   The U.S.-backed Contras agreed to give up their 10-year-old
battle in June. Their leftist Sandinista foes were defeated at the
polls in February by Mrs. Chamorro's conservative United National
Opposition coalition.
   Mrs. Chamorro has reduced the size of the army - which with the
police is still controlled by the Sandinistas - and promised the
demobilized Contras land and support for their resettlement.
   But her efforts at reconciliation have fallen short of former
fighters' expectations, and strong antagonisms persist between the
Contras and the armed forces and police.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Frank Cesar said Monday the
government is investigating the clash in Jalapa, which he said,
``in no way contributes to the reconciliation and pacification of
the country.''
   In a television broadcast, Cesar condemned a series of attacks
on UNO elected officials that began during the weekend.
   A bomb destroyed the car of an UNO lawmaker Humberto Castilla
and part of his home in the southeastern town of Juigalpa on
Saturday. Castilla, a hard-liner who pushed for the army budget
cuts, was out of the country at the time. No one was hurt in the
blast.
   Grenads were fired Sunday and Monday at the homes of several
other coalition mayors and deputies who backed the budget cuts. No
injuries were reported in the offensive that UNO blamed on army
members.
   Mrs. Chamorro, returning Monday from a Costa Rican summit in
which Central American presidents addressed demilitarization of the
region, said she wants to reduce the Sandinista army's size.
   But she said, ``We can't do things overnight.''
   She has cut thousands of soldiers from the ranks of the army,
and the 39-member Sandinista bloc in the National Assembly opposed
the military budget reduction, saying it would mean firing 10,000
more.
   On Sunday, the army took full-page ads in pro-Sandinista
newspapers and ran television spots to publicize a three-page
communique that said some legislators were pushing Nicaragua into
``chaos and a bloodbath'' by voting for the budget reduction.
   ``As humans that we are we cannot throw into the street the army
or any civilian,'' Mrs. Chamorro said Monday.
   Mrs. Chamorro is treading a fine line between the polarized
positions of the powerful Sandinista party and the 14-party UNO
coalition, whose 51 deputies in the 92-member National Assembly
voted in unprecedented unity for the military budget cut on Friday.
The leglislature includes two independents.
   Since taking office in April, she has weathered paralyzing
Sandinista union general strikes and a series of roadblocks by
sympathizers of former Contras.
   The dissidence from both sides has erupted in violence but the
shootout Sunday claimed more lives than any incident before.

   Twenty-eight Albanians used
improvised rafts to cross the Bojana River and enter Yugoslavia
early today, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   It said the group was made up of six children, four women and 18
men.
   More than 600 Albanians have fled to Yugoslavia this year, and
Tanjug said 207 used the Bojana River as their escape route.
   The report gave no further details.
   Albania, isolated by hard-line Communist rulers for decades,
last week became the last European state to allow creation of an
opposition party. The Democratic Party of Albania was formed
Wednesday by a coaltion of students and intellectuals following
several days of protests.
   Late in the week, violent anti-government demonstrations
occurred in several Albanian cities, and more than 150 people were
arrested.
   Albania announced limited reforms in May, including
liberalization of travel restrictions and abolition of the death
penalty for those fleeing the country.More than 4,000 Albanians
were allowed to leave in July after taking refuge in Western
embassies in Tirana, the capital.
   Despite the changes, many Albanians have continued to cross into
neighboring Yugoslavia and Greece without government permission.

   Miami's Little Haiti became cloaked in red-and-blue
Haitian flags while chants erupted of ``Titid! Titid!'' - the
nickname of the priest many Haitian-Americans hoped would become
the island nation's next president.
   The revelers' celebration Monday was of the apparent victory of
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti's first democratic elections. The
thousands of cheering, dancing Haitian immigrants still awaited the
official outcome of Sunday's presidential election.
   But projections made by 800 foreign observers showed Aristide
winning by as much as 70 percent of the vote. Final results were
not expected until late today.
   Amid the joyous din of what looked like a massive street party,
members of the crowd spoke feverishly of the priest who first
became prominent ministering to Haiti's poor.
   ``This is the greatest day in the history of Haiti,'' said Mona
Michel, a director of the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. The educator
joined hundreds in the crowd, prompting Miami police to close off
to traffic for about a block of the street running through the
heart of the city's Haitian neighborhood.
   Michael Besile carried a live red rooster, the Aristide
trademark ``coq qualite'' - ``quality rooster.''
   ``It's going to be better now. He's a good person, a person we
know will do good,'' Besile said.
   Haitian-Americans disappointed by a succession of corrupt,
despotic leaders said they have confidence that Aristide - depicted
in some of their posters as being physically blessed by Jesus
Christ - can bring about change.
   On street corners, youths sipped from bottles and cans wrapped
in brown paper bags and tapped out lively rhythms on just about
anything that made noise.
   One heavyset woman stood in the middle of the street shouting
out over and over ``Thank God! Oh, Thank You God!''
   Police reported no problems. During the last such celebration in
Little Haiti, marking the fall of the Duvalier family regime on
Feb. 7, 1986, some Duvalier loyalists were attacked.

<HEAD>Panel Says Safety Takes Back Seat to Modernization of Nukes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety of the nation's nuclear weapons was not
given the same urgency as modernization of those systems to meet
military requirements, a special review panel said today.
   Three of the nation's leading physicists, in a report to the
House Armed Services Committee, also expressed concern over the
absence of ``quantitative safety standards'' for the dispersal of
plutonium.
   Plutonium, a highly poisonous component in a nuclear device,
could be released from a weapon by a fire or conventional explosion
as well as by an atomic explosion, the panel said in its 44-page
report.
   ``Although plutonium dispersal is a much less threatening danger
than a sizable nuclear yield, it is nevertheless a potentially
serious hazard, particularly if the plutonium is aerosolized in a
chemical detonation,'' the panel said.
   Its members are Dr. Sidney D. Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center; Nobel laureate Dr. Charles H.
Townes of the University of California at Berkeley and Dr. John S.
Foster, head of the Defense Science Board.
   The Armed Services Committee empaneled the three in May after
questions were raised about the safety of several nuclear weapons
systems, including the short-range, air-to-ground attack missile,
known as SRAM-A.
   Since that time, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has taken the
SRAM-A off alert bombers of the Strategic Air Command.
   In the report, the panel said that since the 1950s and the
height of the Cold War, the government gave special consideration
to changes in the system to meet defense needs, and safety was not
treated similarly.
   ``Modernization and improvement programs gave priority to
military requirements,'' the report said. ``Safety in general was
not viewed with the same urgency.''
   Modification of the system has moved slowly and, due to budget
constraints, the emphasis has been on acquiring new weapons.
   ``In anticipation ... many older ones remain in today's nuclear
stockpile that do not meet present nuclear weapons design
criteria,'' the panel said.
   It recommended, among other things, that all weapons be equipped
with modern enhanced nuclear detonation safety systems and that all
nuclear bombs on aircraft be equipped with insensitive high
explosives and fire-resistant pits within the weapons.
   ``These are the two most critical safety features currently
available for avoiding plutonium dispersal in the event of aircraft
fires or crashes,'' the report said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said the report calls for a reassessment of the nation's
priorities for nuclear weapons, with safety ahead of military
effectiveness.
   ``Improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations gives us breathing space
to begin planning now for a nuclear arsenal that is cheaper and
smaller than the one we have today, as well as safer,'' Aspin said.
   The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. William Dickinson
of Alabama, said the panel of physicists ``correctly notes that
many of the safety problems identified to date have been or are in
the process of being fixed. Nonetheless, the panel did express the
view that there is still room for improvement.''

<HEAD>Army Retirees Ordered to Active Duty for Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 8, Those recalled, describing those recalled.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Today's ``volunteer'' Army is looking for more
than volunteers.
   For the first time in nearly three decade, the Army is
searching out military retirees - especially those with medical
skills - and forcing them back into uniform.
   As the buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf surges toward
the 400,000 level and the United Nations deadline nears for an
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the Army is digging deep into its
personnel records for help in supporting the force.
   Lt. Col. Henry H. Hanrahan, an Army planner, said Monday that an
initial callup of 15 retired physician assistants was approved last
week, and about 200 other retirees probably would be involuntarily
recalled for active duty over the next month.
   It is the first involuntary use of Army retirees since the 1961
crisis over East Germany's erection of the Berlin Wall.
   Hanrahan said in an interview that about 4,000 Army retirees
have volunteered for duty in the gulf crisis, but that involuntary
callups were needed because there aren't enough volunteers with the
skills needed most. The Army is especially eager to get more
medical specialists in uniform.
   About 150 volunteers have been put on active duty, and about
half of those are performing medical duties in support of Operation
Desert Shield, Hanrahan said. Approximately 300 more volunteers are
likely to go on active duty over the coming month, he said.
   Those recalled would consist of former officers who retired
after 20 or more years of service.
   Retired military officers aren't required to maintain any active
association with the services. But a service secretary has the
authority to force retired personnel back into uniform if it is
deemed necessary for national security.
   The Army's increasing need for medical skills reflects a broader
trend within the U.S. military as tens of thousands more American
troops are deployed to Saudi Arabia and the Jan. 15 United Nations
deadline approaches for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The Navy last week disclosed that it is deploying two additional
500-bed mobile field hospitals in the projected combat zone in
Saudi Arabia and that it plans to call up 8,000 reservists to
increase Navy medical support.
   The Navy announced Monday that 769 Navy Reserve members,
including many medical specialists, are being ordered to active
duty. Last week it called up about 2,300 medical reservists.
   Hanrahan said that in adition to the retirees who have
volunteered for duty, about 5,000 members of the Individual Ready
Reserve have offered their services, and about 1,000 of those have
been placed on active duty.
   ``These are not Rambo types. They see that their country has a
need and they want to be a part of it,'' Hanrahan said.
   The IRR is the second echelon of reservists, mostly former
enlisted personnel and officers. They cannot be involuntarily
called to active duty under the Aug. 22 reserve callup authority
issued by President Bush.
   The presidential order allows the callup of up to 200,000
members of the Selected Reserve - members of the National Guard and
Reserve who are required to train one weekend per month and attend
a two-week training session once a year.
   Members of the IRR generally are not required to train. There
are 278,000 Army members in the IRR.
   The Army faces an increasing need for individual volunteers to
perform duties such as truck driving, water purification, medical
service and graves registration, Hanrahan said. Some also are
needed to fill out the three National Guard combat brigades placed
on active duty for possible deployment to the gulf, he said.
   The Army is concerned about a recent drop in the number of IRR
volunteers, Hanrahan said, noting that about 600 who had offered to
serve had backed out.
   Over the next month the Army expects to need500 to 800 more
volunteers from the IRR for active duty, beyond the 1,000
volunteers already put in uniform, he said. And if the gulf crisis
erupts into war, the need for individual replacements will greatly
increase, he added.
   Members of the Individual Ready Reserve can volunteer by calling
the Army Reserve Personnel Center in St. Louis at 1-800-325-2660.

   President Bush today gave all federal
employees a half-day off on Monday, Christmas Eve.
   His order closes all federal departments and agencies early on
Dec. 24, but allows department heads to require certain workers or
offices to work a full day if needed ``for reasons of national
security or defense or for other essential public reasons.''
   The order did not specify a quitting time, but most offices were
likely to close around noon, local time.
   Bush's order did not extend to the following Monday, Dec. 31.
   Government offices are closed both Dec. 25 and Jan. 1.
   The order does not affect state or local government employees.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says direct
talks with the United States would be useless if the Americans only
reiterate U.N. Security Council resolutions on the crisis, it was
reported today.
   ``We have already read them (the resolutions), we know them and
we rejected them,'' Saddam told a Turkish television journalist.
   The 25-minute interview is scheduled for broadcast later this
week on state television, but excerpts were released today.
   The United States has said any talks would center on reminding
Saddam of the U.N. demands that Iraq withdraw unconditionally from
Kuwait by Jan. 15 and allow the return of the legitimate Kuwaiti
government.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the emirate six days
later.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had been due in Washington on
Monday to meet with President Bush. But the visit was put off after
Saddam rejected U.S. proposals for a date to meet with the
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   In the interview, Saddam again ruled out any concessions on
Kuwait before the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved. If it
is settled, he said, ``we can make similar concessions'' on Kuwait.
   The United States has consistently rejected any such linkage of
the Persian Gulf crisis and the Palestinian problem.
   ``Those who want respect for the international laws and Security
Council decisions should first solve this 23-year-old problem and
comply with laws and council decisions before using double
standards,'' Saddam was quoted as saying.
   Saddam also said Iraq posed no military threat to Turkey, which
complied with U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq by cutting off an
Iraqi oil pipeline.

   Former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch was
hit in the head with a rock today as he toured Jerusalem's old,
walled city with Mayor Teddy Kollek, witnesses said.
   Koch and Kollek continued on their walk through the narrow
alleys of the Old City, and Koch did not appear seriously hurt,
reportedly suffering only a scratch on the top of his head.
   The former mayor later told reporters: ``I know the stone wasn't
meant for me because everyone likes me.''
   He also said he hoped American Jews would ignore such incidents
and show their support for Israel by coming to visit. ``This
shouldn't make people afraid,'' he said. ``It should make them
angry.''
   Witnesses said Koch and Kollek were walking on David Street, a
narrow lane of tourist shops in the Christian Quarter, when a stone
about one inch in diameter was thrown toward them.
   The rock bounced off a store awning and hit Koch on the top of
the head, the witnesses said. He used a handkerchief to stem slight
bleeding.
   Bonnie Boxer, a press aide to Kollek, said city officials put
two adhesive bandages on Koch's wound, which was described by city
officials as a scratch.
   ``If you had a head of hair like mine, nothing would have
happened,'' Kollek quipped later. Kollek, 79, has thick gray hair;
Koch is balding.
   Koch told radio station WNEW-AM in New York that the rock
``obviously was thrown to cause fright, but it didn't frighten
Teddy Kollek and it didn't frighten me.''
   After today's incident, Kollek retrieved the stone and gave it
to Koch as a souvenir, the witnesses said. The two then proceeded
without further problems to the neighboring Jewish Quarter.
   They did not have a police escort, witnesses said.
   There were no reports of arrests in the case.
   Stones have been the main weapon of the 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation. Jerusalem's Old City is part
of the area Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.
Palestinians consider it occupied.
   Koch, who turned 66 last week, is a long-time supporter of the
Jewish state. He was in Israel as a guest of the city of Tel Aviv,
where a street was dedicated in his name over the weekend.
   On his visit today, Kollek showed him sections of the Wailing
Wall - also known as the Western Wall - that have been unearthed by
archeologists and soon will be open to the public.
   Koch described it as ``touching history.''
   Shops along David Street were shuttered in a strike called by
the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas to protest Israel's plans to
deport four Hamas activists. The deportations were ordered last
week after the stabbing deaths of three Israelis blamed on Hamas.

   The State Department is advising U.S. citizens

where tens of thousands of students and workers are on strike in an
effort to pressure the government to step down.
   Large street demonstrations in Bucharest, the capital, and the
cities of Timisoara and Brasov ``could involve significant unrest
and be a potential threat to the safety of foreign visitors,'' the
department said Monday in a travel advisory.
   It said transportation services also may be disrupted by strikes
or other labor unrest.
   U.S. citizens in Romania were advised to register and keep in
close touch with the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest.

   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says it is
prepared to issue permits allowing the capture of eight to 10
Florida panthers a year for the next three to six years in an
effort to save the endangered species.
   The Florida panther is a subspecies of cougar, also known as
puma or mountain lion. Although it once roamed much of the
Southeast, it is making its last stand in southwestern Florida.
Only 30 to 50 adult animals are believed to survive.
   ``As it stands now, you've got the whole population clustered in
one corner of southwest Florida. Just one hurricane is all it would
take to wipe out the whole species,'' said Dennis Jordan,
coordinator of the Florida Panther Interagency Committee, a group
of state and federal wildlife agencies.
   Captive breeding, which could begin next month, is only one part
of the effort to save the Florida panther, said Vicki Boatwright,
spokeswoman for the federal agency's Southeast regional office in
Atlanta.
   ``The most important part is habitat preservation,'' she said
Monday.
   Congress has provided for expansion of parks and wildlife
refuges in the area to protect habitat for the animals. The
panthers use about 2.2 million acres of land, of which about 1.2
million acres is publicly owned.
   It won't be too hard to find kittens, said David Maehr, a
Florida biologist. Six of seven adult females being tracked by
radio collar have given birth this year and the seventh is believed
to be pregnant.
   Analyses conducted by the Florida Panther Interagency Committee
concluded the species would be extinct within 40 years under
prevailing conditions.
   Final approval of the captive breeding program would allow the
state to capture up to six kittens and four older animals in the
first year and up to six kittens and two older animals in following
years.
   Applications to be part of the breeding program have come from
several Florida zoos, including the Jacksonville Zoo, Tampa's
Lowery Park Zoo, the Miami Metrozoo and the White Oak Plantation at
Yulee.

   Assailants shot and killed an official of
the right-wing Christian Phalange Party today in the first major
challenge to the government's latest effort to end Lebanon's more
than 15-year-old civil war.
   A police spokesman identified the victim as Sami Abu Jawdeh, a
jewler who also heads the Phalange Party's branch in the Zalka
district.
   Two unidentified gunmen stormed his jewelry shop and shot him
with silencer-equipped pistols. He ``died instantly of four gunshot
wounds in the skull and chest,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The gunmen escaped in a waiting car, he said.
   The spokesman said the killing ``apparently was politically
motivated. The gunmen did not steal anything from the shop. They
shot him and escaped.''
   But police said they had no indications as to who was behind the
killing.
   Zalka is part of Greater Beirut. Lebanese Army units were
deployed in Beirut and its immediate surroundings Dec. 3 under a
plan to end militia control, reunify the capital and pave the way
for a final settlement to the civil war that has claimed more than
150,000 lives.
   Security conditions had improved following the militia pullout.
   Greater Beirut stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the
Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south.

   As if food shortages and ethnic unrest
are not enough to keep the Soviet Union busy, the nation is
actually seeking new hazards. Only they're the kind you find on the
golf course.
   A team from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and American
International Golf Resorts have reached an agreement to finish and
operate a country club and recreation center outside Moscow.
   The 285-acre, 18-hole golf course in a birch and evergreen
forest is expected to be completed next year. It is believed to be
the first of its kind in the Soviet Union.
   A recreation center, including a luxury hotel, is expected to be
completed in 1992, according to American International, of
Greenbrae, Calif.
   The resort initially will be used by diplomats, foreign
businessmen and tourists. But eventually Soviet citizens will be
able to enjoy the delights and frustrations of golf with visitors
from other countries.
   ``It will be a meeting ground,'' said Ivan Ivanovich Sergeev,
the deputy director of Diplomatic Corps Service Bureau, a division
of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, who spoke through an interpreter.
   ``It's not purely a commercial enterprise. It will enhance the
trust between these people.''
   Five hundred memberships in the resort 18 miles west of Moscow
will sell for the equivalent of $50,000 to $100,000 each - far
above the reach of the average Soviet citizen.
   But John Lisanti, American International's chairman and chief
executive officer, said it will not be long before some Soviets
have enough rubles to take up the driver and putter.
   ``A lot of fortunes will be made in today's Soviet Union, and we
believe in the very near future many Soviet citizens will make some
of those fortunes and will be able to buy memberships in this
resort,'' he said.
   The joint venture agreement, reached at a Palo Alto law firm on
Friday, calls for Lisanti's company to contribute $30 million, or
half the cost of the project.
   Private investors will have a 50 percent stake in the course and
receive half the profits. The Soviet government will own the other
half of the resort and keep the other half of the profits.
   American International also will help market the club throughout
the world to draw visitors.
   Noted golf course architect Robert Trent Jones Jr. of Palo Alto
is designing the course. The Soviet Union hired Jones in 1988 to
build the 7,000-yard, par-72 course.
   The club will include townhouses and areas for tennis, swimming,
tobogganing, cross-country skiing and restaurants. The 175-bed
hotel was completed a year ago but will be expanded by 100 rooms.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today gave European allies
the go-ahead for talks with Iraq as long as ``mixed signals'' are
not sent. But the European Community decided not to hold such a
meeting now, officials said.
   In another development, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was
quoted as saying any U.S.-Iraqi talks would be useless if the
American side only repeats United Nations demands to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, thousands of Iraqi reservists reported to army units
today on call-up orders from their rulers for all able-bodied
33-year-old reservists.
   Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council said ``many heads will roll
and many thrones will fall,'' if war breaks out in the gulf.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had planned talks this week
with Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis of Italy, the European
Community chairman.
   European leaders put the meeting on hold after talks that had
been scheduled for Monday between Aziz and President Bush were
scrubbed.
   Baker said today he had no problem with a European meeting with
Aziz.
   European Community foreign minsters reconsidered the matter,
then decided against any talks unless Iraq holds talks with the
United States first, officials said.
   ``A meeting will take place if Aziz goes to Washington first,''
said Irish Foreign Minister Gerald Collins.
   ``We must maintain the pressure on Iraq,'' said Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, the community's executive
body.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry today criticized the EC's earlier
refusal to hold talks, accusing the Europeans of trying to
``appease'' the United States.
   Baker, speaking at a news conference after a two-day meeting of
foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
Belgium, said: ``We support ... any diplomatic efforts that might
result in a peaceful solution.''
   ``The one thing we do discourage,'' he said, ``are discordant
messages, mixed messages or mixed signals.''
   The Bush-Aziz talks on Monday were scrubbed over differences on
the timing of a subsequent trip to Baghdad by Baker.
   Saddam has sought to hold the meeting Jan. 12, which Bush says
is too late. Bush has said Saddam's intransigence on the issue
signals his lack of willingness to leave Kuwait as the coalition
lined up against him insists.
   A Turkish report today quoted Saddam as saying direct talks with
the United States would be useless if the American side merely
reiterates U.N. Security Council resolutions on the crisis.
   ``We have already read them (the resolutions), we know them and
we rejected them,'' Saddam told a Turkish television journalist in
an interview to be broadcast this week on state television.
Excerpts were released today.
   Saddam also repeated his demand that a withdrawal from Kuwait be
linked to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The
United States has repeatedly said the issues are unrelated.
   Iran's president, meanwhile, said if Iraq finds itself under
attack by the U.S.-led forces, the Baghdad government itself would
bear the responsibility.
   The official Islamic Republic News agency, monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus, quoted Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying ``we
are feeling very uneasy over the fact that the Iraqi people may be
hurt by the Americans.''
   But he told a group of college students in Tehran that ``the
responsibility for this rests with the Iraqi regime,'' IRNA said.
   Iran and Iraq fought a 1980-88 war, but Baghdad moved to make
peace with Tehran after it invaded Kuwait.
   In Baghdad today, Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said said
that 2,042 children under age 5 have died of disease and
malnutrition because of shortages in baby food and medicine
resulting from a U.N.-ordered trade embargo. Said claimed on Dec. 3
that 1,416 children had died because of the sanctions.
   Iraq has offered no proof of the claims, and diplomats in
Baghdad have discounted the reports of shortages, noting that the
Security Council decided in October to allow shipments of essential
food and medicines to Iraq.
   In Iraq, thousands of reservists reported to their army units
today as part of a major military mobilization to counter a feared
offensive by the U.S.-led multinational force.
   On Monday, the Defense Ministry ordered all able-bodied
33-year-old reservists to report for duty by Thursday for short
periods of retraining before being assigned to active duty.
   It was Iraq's third major callup of reserves in recent weeks.
Most reservists served in the military during the 1980-88 war with
Iran.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -Yevgeny Primakov, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top
aide on the gulf crisis, said the departure of 2,500 Soviet workers
from Iraq has been delayed only by technical matters and the desire
of many to remain until their contracts expire. There had been
speculation Baghdad was trying to hold the Soviet contract workers
as hostages.
   -The Japanese Foreign Ministry said today Japan would quickly
respond to a request from the U.S. military for $300 million worth
of vehicles, computers, medical supplies and other goods. Japanese
corporations plan to donate 20,000 stereo headsets to the U.S.-led
multilateral forces, the ministry said.
   -Prince Charles will visit British troops in the gulf this
weekend, Buckingham Palace said today. Charles' wife, Princess
Diana, will fly to Germany on Wednesday to visit families of
British soldiers serving in the region, the palace said.

   In a stormy session of the Soviet parliament
today, Moldavians walked out to protest the presence of rival
groups and legislators heatedly debated a Union Treaty designed to
hold the nation together.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he wants Soviet citizens to
vote this winter in a referendum on whether to sign the pact.
   ``I introduced a suggestion to hold a referendum, and those who
don't want a union, let them go and secede,'' Gorbachev told
reporters in the parliament building's lobby. But he reiterated his
demand that any secession must take place within the framework of
Soviet law. ``It's a divorce process,'' he said.
   During the second day of the Fourth Congress of People's
Deputies, the Ukrainian Communist Party leader reportedly said the
national legislature could deadlock over Gorbachev's proposed
treaty.
   Several parliamentarians among the 440 scheduled to speak on the
treaty expressed hope it would be signed. But others rejected the
document, assuring protracted debate at the 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies.
   ``We won't sign the Union Treaty. There is no chance of that
now,'' said Dimitru Matkovsky, one of about two dozen Moldavian
deputies who left the cavernous Kremlin Palace of Congresses today.
   Matkovsky said his delegation was angry that the Congress had
invited as guests representatives of two ethnic groups seeking
autonomy within Moldavia. He said Moldavians would not participate
in the session until the groups left.
   Sitting in the hall were representatives of the Turkish
Christian minority, Gagauz, from southern Moldavia, and Slavs from
the eastern Dniester region. Both groups have declared autonomy in
their corners of the republic.
   Ethnic turmoil and disputes between the central government and
the republics have so far prevented negotiations over the Union
Treaty.
   In a state-of-the-union address Monday, Gorbachev said the
greatest threat to the Soviet Union was not economic decay but the
secessionist movements. He proposed a nationwide, popular
referendum be held on the concept of the treaty, which would form a
new federation of the 15 Soviet republics.
   All republics have declared some form of sovereignty since
March. The declarations have paralyzed power in the country,
worsening food shortages and hastening economic collapse.
   The treaty would preserve central control over national security
and such key industries as transportation and energy, and natural
wealth such as gold and diamonds. Most republics want more
independence in such areas, as well as to make their own economic
decisions.
   In an interview published in Pravda, the Communist Party
newspaper, Ukrainian Commmunist Party boss Stanislav Gurenko, also
a parliamentarian, told Pravda that the Union Treaty issue could
deadlock the Congress.
   ``I am afraid that deputies may split on political issues and,
above all, on a Union Treaty,'' Gurenko said.
   Gurenko also said some legislators ``have in some or other
measure lost touch with what is happening in their republics. ...
This, too, may create some additional difficulties.''
   Gorbachev wants the Congress to endorse the Union Treaty,
although only the legislatures of the republics have the power to
approve it. If the national legislature is deadlocked, however, the
treaty's future comes into question.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel today rejected the Union Treaty
referendum. ``There never was a free expression of the will of the
Estonian people'' about their forced incorporation into the Soviet
Union in 1940 ``and there was no referendum then,'' Ruutel told the
Congress.
   Byelorussian Communist Party chief Anatoly Malofeyev urged the
deputies to support the treaty as a way out of the political and
economic crisis, the state news agency Tass reported.
   Anatoly Sobchak, a Congress deputy and the mayor of Leningrad,
told Tass he supported the Union Treaty to break the paralysis of
power.
   Newly appointed Interior Minister Boris Pugo, apparently trying
to reassure deputies who fear he will crack down on independence
movements, said the republics' demands for sovereignty were
inescapable.
   He said in a Tass interview, however, that he needs Congress'
approval for more power to combat a nationwide breakdown of law and
order.
   The Congress is expected to last 10 days.
   It is also scheduled to debate constitutional amendments to
strengthen presidential power by adding a vice president and
replacing the 89-member Council of Ministers with a Cabinet of
about 15 people.

   A 9-year-old ballet dancer on tour with
the Indianapolis Ballet Theatre was struck and killed by a pickup
truck, police said.
   Paul W. Bryant of Indianapolis was pronounced dead at Mecosta
General Hospital about an hour after the accident at 6:30 p.m.
Monday in Big Rapids Township, according to officials at the
Mecosta County Sheriff's Department.
   Bryant's 7-year-old brother, Matthew, also was involved in the
accident and treated for an ankle injury.
   Police said a pickup truck swerved to avoid the boys as they
crossed a road. But the truck struck Paul, and a second vehicle
also hit the youngster, police said. Neither driver was injured.
   Members of the ballet company planned a memorial service before
tonight's performance of The Nutcracker Suite at Ferris State
University. The victim was in one of 12 supporting roles held by
children in the ballet.
   ``It's important for us as fellow dancers and fellow human
beings to do this,'' ballet director Dace Dindonis said of the
tribute. ``Dance is such a spiritual art form and that is what we
want to emphasize, now, more than ever, is its spiritualness.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - A supporter of the former Duvalier
regime today criticized the United States for saying a leftist
priest apparently won the presidential election before complete,
official results were released.
   He said such a move could incite violence in Haiti.
   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a fiery champion of the poor,
won as much as 70 percent of the vote in Sunday's elections, which
also chose a new legislature, according to projections by the 800
foreign observers.
   The capital, Port-au-Prince, was quiet today after Monday's wild
jubilation by Aristide's supporters and a shooting incident that
left a woman dead.
   With slightly more than 1 percent of the estimated 2 million
votes counted, Aristide had 70.6 percent; former World Bank
official Marc Bazin 12.6 percent; agronomist Louis Dejoie Jr. 6.9
percent; and evangelical preacher Sylvio Claude 2.7 percent. Seven
other candidates were in the race.
   The Electoral Council released the partial results Monday, but
did not indicate when further results would be made public.
   It gave no explanation for the delay.
   Bernard W. Aronson, assistant U.S. secretary of state for
inter-American affairs said Monday of Aristide:
   ``We fully respect him as the apparent president-elect of Haiti
and look forward to closely working with his government.''
   But a spokesman for Roger Lafontant, self-proclaimed leader of
the Tonton Macoutes and of other supporters of the former 29-year
Duvalier dictatorship, said the U.S. government had picked the
winner before the results were in. He said that move ``could put
people in the streets who will incite violence.''
   ``The American government can't decide who won. It's against the
law. You (the United States) don't have the right,'' said Serge
Conille, executive-secretary of Lafontant's party, the Union for
National Conciliation.
   Lafontant returned from exile this year and announced his
candidacy, but was barred from running for president by the
Electoral Council.
   ``We'll decide after the results are in how we are going to act,
but it won't be in a violent way,'' Conille said.
   A spokeswoman at Bazin's party headquarters said he would not
commet on the election until final results were in. Dejoie
conceded defeat Monday.
   ``We are very disappointed, but we are democrats. If that's what
the people want, it's okay,'' said Danielle Bazin, a party official
and sister-in-law of Bazin.
   About 70 percent of the registered voters cast ballots Sunday
for president, a 110-member National Assembly and local officials.
   Observers from the United Nations and the Organization of
American States said the vote was orderly and without fraud,
despite delays and some irregularities at voting stations.
   Tens of thousands of Haitians poured into the streets Monday
morning, singing and dancing, honking car horns and blocking
traffic with their jubliant celebrations of Aristide's presumed
victory.
   But at midday, police wearing gas masks fired into a crowd
celebrating outside St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church, killing a
pregnant 44-year-old woman, then running her over in a blue pickup
truck, witnesses said.
   Assassins attacked the church in September 1988 as Aristide was
saying Mass, killing 12 people and wounding 70. Aristide escaped
and went into hiding.
   An army statement denied responsibility for Monday's shootings,
saying police had fired into the air to disperse demonstrators
threatening to lynch an undentified man. Police in Haiti are under
the authority of the army.
   The capital was nearly deserted as Haitians fled indoors,
fearing more violence from holdovers of the Duvalier family regime,
ousted in 1986 when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled into
exile.
   The only other time Haitians had a chance to freely choose their
leader, in November 1987, 34 voters were shot and hacked to death
at polling stations by thugs supported by the army. The vote was
canceled.
   Aristide would take office on Feb. 7, the fifth anniversary of
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier's departure.
   Roger Lafontant, who led Duvalier's feared Tonton Macoute
militia, said last week he would ``do anything'' to keep Aristide
from becoming president, saying Haiti would ``never be delivered to
communism.''
   There has also been concern that the United States would not be
pleased by the election because of Aristide's leftist ideology and
anti-American rhetoric, which was toned down in the last few
months.
   Aristide was expelled from the conservative Salesian order in
1988 for allegedly inciting the poor to revolt.
   He is a proponent of Liberation Theology, which encourages the
poor to fight for their rights instead of waiting for an eternal
reward.

   Poland's government-in-exile will hand
over its historic symbols of authority to Lech Walesa at a ceremony
Saturday after his inauguration as president, a spokesman for
Walesa said today.
   Parliament Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz has called the National
Assembly into session on Friday and Saturday. The assembly is to
formally approve the election results Friday and witness Walesa's
inauguration Saturday.
   Andrzej Drzycimski, a Walesa spokesman, said representatives of
the government-in-exile were in Warsaw to discuss a ceremony to be
attended by Ryszard Kaczorowski, president of the London-based
government that dates to World War II.
   The transfer of symbols means the government-in-exile will cease
to exist.
   Walesa, who won election Dec. 9, is expected to receive the
insignia of power from Kaczorowski at Warsaw's Royal Castle, former
seat of the presidency, after being sworn into office as president.
   On Monday, Polish authorities said they are investigating three
generals and five colonels in the 1970 shootings of striking
workers along the Baltic Coast that left at least 45 people dead.
   Walesa, then an unknown electrician in Gdansk, was among the
leaders of the 1970 strike over food price increases that prompted
the crackdown by security forces. The protests helped pave the way
for the birth of the Solidarity free trade union movement a decade
later.
   Justice Minister Aleksander Bentkowski did not name the officers
under investigation, but said the initial order to shoot the
workers was given by the late Wladyslaw Gomulka, then the Communist
Party leader.
   A final decision on whether to put the eight officers on trial
will be made by March, Bentkowski said.
   ``At present we have enough evidence to present charges against
eight persons - three generals and five colonels who were directly
involved in the events,'' Bentkowski told state television Monday
night.
   ``I think that revealing their names is not proper now as the
investigation is under way. We plan to end the proceedings by the
end of March,'' he said.
   The Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper reported today that the military
prosecutor had already presented preliminary criminal accusations
against the eight.
   The newspaper said that unless the accused prove that they were
acting in self-defense or out of higher necessity, they could be
charged with homicide or abetting homicide.
   Official Communist accounts say 45 people, including 28 in the
cities of Gdansk and Gdynia, were killed by security forces in the
December 1970 anti-government protests, which began when workers
went on strike to protest food price increases.
   Many people believe the death toll was higher, and
investigations are being conducted to see if names of additional
victims can be found.
   Victims of the 1970 shootings were buried secretly, often
without family members being informed.
   Bentkowski said that so far 160 witnesses have been questioned
in the case.
   He said Gomulka's order to shoot the protesters was relayed by
the late Prime Minister Jozef Cyrankiewicz to Gen. Grzegorz
Korczynski, the army commander in Gdansk.
   The strikes led to Gomulka's replacement as party leader by
Edward Gierek, who remained in power until he was toppled after the
August 1980 strikes that resulted in the founding of Solidarity.
   Walesa, who led the 1980 strikes, insisted that those who died
in 1970 should not be forgotten. At Solidarity's insistence, a
monument to the slain workers was unveiled in December 1980.
   On Sunday, the 20th anniversary of the killings in Gdansk,
Walesa returned to the monument to pay homage to the slain workers.
   ``Solidarity was born from their blood,'' said Walesa.

   Edward Gnehm, known to his friends as Skip, is
usually the life of the party.
   But not this holidy season.
   ``People keep coming up to me at these Christmas parties and
saying: `Didn't we give a going-away party for you six months
ago?'''
   He says he and his wife are thinking of giving a ``we're still
here'' party.
   Gnehm was packing in preparation for his post as the new U.S.
ambassador to Kuwait when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded
that country Aug. 2.
   But that doesn't mean Gnehm is out of a job. On the contrary.
   He's been putting his experience - as a former deputy assistant
secretary of state and a former deputy secretary of defense - to
maximum use.
   Gnehm, who speaks Arabic, has traveled far and wide to recruit
the support of Arab countries for the administration's anti-Iraq
coalition. From Algeria in northern Africa, to Iraq' next-door
neighbor Jordan, Gnehm has been making the U.S. case.
   His recent visit to Jordan was particularly emotional for Gnehm.
He served in Amman as the deputy ambassador several years ago and
still has friends there, many of whom berated him for U.S. policy
on Iraq.
   Gnehm is determined he'll take up his ambassadorial post,
although Kuwait will probably be a different country - more  Adds Marian's
10-year-old neighbor, Carla Oliva: ``They're not
just books to read for enjoyment. They teach you a lot of things .
.. like how life is different for different people and how to get
along with each other.''
   Although Martin weaves serious themes into her books, she
chooses not to address such weighty topics as sexual or substance
abuse of any kind.
   It's not that the issues shouldn't be dealt with, the author
said.
   ``I think there are a lot of girls who would benefit from
reading about (them), but there are also first-graders out there
who are reading these books and those subjects are too heavy for
them,'' she said.
   So Martin sticks to more manageable problems, including the
perennial trials of youth:
   ``Questions about their self-esteem, their self-worth. How
important is it to be pretty, to be popular? All sorts of things
that we worried about when we were younger. I don't think those
things ever change.''

   Her son Emad, 34, is to be expelled as a leader of Hamas, the
outlawed Moslem fundamentalist group that wants to destroy Israel

   He was ordered deported after three Israelis were stabbed to

   The space shuttle Columbia
began the first leg of a two-day ferry flight to Kennedy Space
Center today, NASA said.
   The Boeing 747 carrying the orbiter on its back took off at 7:03

   Spokesman Don Haley said the 747 was scheduled to refuel at
Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, and would continue on to
Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, La., for an overnight stay
before continuing on to Florida.
   If bad weather prevents the aircraft from going to Louisiana,
the ferry crew will stay at Kelly Air Force Base at San Antonio,
Texas.
   Columbia was launched Dec. 2 on a science mission. The seven-man
crew operated telescopes in the payload bay to gather infrared and
X-ray data from celestial objects.
   The mission was marred by problems controlling the telescopes
but astronomers were elated by the data Columbia succeeded in
bringing home.
   The planned 10-day mission was shortened a day when rain was
forecast for the landing site. Columbia made a late-night touchdown
on Dec. 10.
   The ferry flight from California was delayed two days by bad

<HEAD>How Long Could Iraq Wage War? It Depends on Pre-Embargo Stockpiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's ability to wage a prolonged war depends
heavily on its military parts stockpiles, and analysts believe the
trade embargo has left some critical weapons systems especially
vulnerable to shortages.
   Saddam Hussein learned early in Iraq's war against Iran to build
parts inventories and has spent billions manufacturing his own
weapons and buying from other nations.
   But Pentagon and private analysts believe the combat stress on
high-maintenance systems such as radar and jet fighters would drain
Iraq's supplies, forcing it to cannibalize for parts and eventually
leaving some sensitive systems weakened or inoperable.
   Absent combat, CIA Director William Webster has told Congress,
Iraqi forces probably can sustain current readiness for nine
months, with perhaps some erosion of air force capabilities in
three to six months.
   Over the past decade Iraq has developed an arms industry that
produces small arms, ammunition, artillery shells and some spare
parts for tanks and other equipment.
   But Iraq is not believed capable of making engine and electronic
parts it would need to keep its most sensitive equipment running in
prolonged combat. Instead, Iraq would be dependent on reserves and
perhaps underground arms markets.
   U.S. officials say there is no evidence of major cracks in the
embargo.
   ``We think we clearly have been successful in closing off the
flow of spare parts and military supplies from the Soviet Union and
France, which previously were his major suppliers,'' Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney told Congress.
   There have been several intervals since the Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait when Iraq's air forces have cut back patrol and training
sorties, leading to speculation that parts already are scarce.
   Pentagon officials are reluctant to discuss intelligence on
Iraqi stockpiles, but one source said Saddam is believed low on
parts for French Mirage jets and probably would suffer shortages of
components needed for radar systems if hostilities erupted and
those installations were attacked. But Iraq has considerable
stockpiles of most conventional equipment, the source said.
   ``He'll reach a point when systems will start to go down all
over the place,'' said Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine general
who visited Iraq near the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
   But Trainor also said that at the time of his visit Iraq had
impressive stores of spare parts and had hired a Japanese company
to computerize its inventories.
   ``Saddam should have a pretty good handle on what he needs and
can plan accordingly, both in terms of strategy and in prioritizing
what they look for in the markets,'' Trainor said.
   The Soviets have provided the United States information on
Iraq's purchases of spares for Soviet-made equipment ranging from
tanks and artillery to antiaircraft missiles and MiG-series
fighters. And the United States has access to Israeli intelligence.
   These official analyses are somewhat suspect, however, because
of Iraq's frequent dealings in the shadowy ``black and gray'' arms
markets.
   ``Exactly what they have in the way of stocks and spare parts,
nobody knows,'' one Army analyst said privately. ``But they are
very sensitive to the fact that repair parts and repair times are
costly and degrade combat power, so they plan against that.''
   Most analysts believe Iraq would have aggressively stockpiled
while planning the Kuwait invasion, remembering that in the early
weeks of the Iran-Iraq war periodic shutoffs of Soviet parts hurt
Iraq's fighting capabilities.
   ``When they go out and acquire something, they are very
different from most Third World countries,'' said Lt. Col. Douglas
V. Johnson, coauthor of a recent Army War College study of Iraq's
military. ``They think of all the spare parts and repair stuff up
front.''
   James Blackwell of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies said Saddam likely had enough spares to support the Kuwait
invasion and a possible invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   ``If that's the case, then even if the embargo is 100 percent
successful he can last a long, long time,'' Blackwell said.
   Potential sources of spares, the embargo notwithstanding, are
arms traders in the Mideast, Asia and Central and South America.
   Before the Kuwait invasion, Iraq was spending an estimated $1
billion a year to import parts. It is now cash-poor because of the
embargo and probably would quickly exhaust currency looted from
Kuwait if it found spares on the black market. Libya is a potential
source for additional financing, as are shady Mideast banks and
financiers.
   Unclear is whether Iraq can complete arms deals if it has cash.
   ``If you've got cash, you can buy just about anything short of a
nuclear weapon,'' said the Army analyst. ``But the price will be
high in this market and the question is, how much cash does he
have?''
   Intelligence agencies track underground arms deals and Blackwell
said the United States should be able to block Baghdad-bound
shipments.
   Trainor was less optimistic.
   ``Saying you've got a handle on the illegal arms markets is like
saying you've got a handle on the drug market,'' he said. ``I just
don't believe it.''

<TEXT>
   An additional 10,000 American troops have
arrived in the Persian Gulf area since last week, and Iraq has
added 10,000 soldiers in and around Kuwait, the Pentagon said
today.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the U.S. force in the gulf
now numbers ``more than 270,000'' soldiers, sailors, airmen and
marines. By late January that number is expected to reach 430,000.
   Iraq now has 510,000 troops in the area, Williams said. He
declined to discuss their exact locations. The Iraqis have added
about 60,000 troops to Kuwait and southern Iraq over the past three
weeks, according to Pentagon figures.
   Nations allied with the United States against Iraq's occupation
of Kuwait now have about 220,000 troops in the area, Williams said.
That is the same number Williams reported last week.

   Arun Vohra was only trying to be a good
citizen when he warned the state highway administration about a
diseased pine tree in front of his house. His reward: The state cut
down seven healthy trees.
   The pine still stands.
   Vohra joined the state's Adopt-a-Highway program last spring,
pledging to keep the woodsy road in front of his house free of
trash and debris. In due course, Vohra spotted a pine tree that
appeared to be infested with borers and called the State Highway
Administration.
   The tree was in front of his house, but on state property.
   ``I felt the tree was dangerous and told them it was going to
fall over and kill somebody, and if it hit overhead power lines
there might be a big tragedy,'' he said.
   Days later, Vohra returned home to find that two other pine
trees, three blooming dogwoods and a giant lilac tree had become
victims of what he calls the Bethesda Chain Saw Massacre.
   The neighboring pine still stood.
   ``These were just awesome trees,'' Vohra says about the six that
were cut down. ``You don't see that kind of trees every day.''
   He got on the phone to the highway administration.
   ``The guy I talked to said, `We're sorry, it was a new man; he
didn't know what he was doing,''' Vohra says. ``I guess he just
went crazy with the chain saw.''
   He was told that the holes in the pine he originally called
about were made by woodpeckers whose foraging for bugs doesn't hurt
a tree.
   Vohra says he called a couple more times, finally letting the
matter drop until November. Then, he talked with Henry Page, the
man in charge of the tree crews.
   ``He came to my house. I showed him the tree ringed with holes.
He said, `Yes, yes, this tree has to come down. It's too close to
power lines,''' Vohra says.
   Page told him the tree was too big for state crews; he'd have to
call in a contractor.
   Vohra said he marked the pine tree with a ribbon, so there would
be no more mistakes.
   But there was.
   The latest victim lay on the ground, neatly sawed - a cedar tree
that had been 80 feet to 100 feet tall, by Vohra's estimate.
   The pine still lived.
   The Montgomery Journal, a daily county newspaper, wrote the
story under the headline: ``They came, they sawed ... they
blundered.''
   ``I was just absolutely in shock,'' Vohra said. ``I acted a
little crazy; I tried to call the governor of Maryland at the
governor's mansion. I called the county police.''
   And his state delegate. And his congresswoman. And the state
department of natural resources.
   The next morning he telephoned Page.
   ``I said: `You cut down the wrong tree. You cut down a cedar,
that lovely cedar tree.' He said: `The cedar is the one you pointed
at.' I said, `We never discussed the cedar tree, that's 15 feet
away.'''
   The Journal quotes Page: ``The dogwoods and lilac, that was a
mistake. This particular time they just went in and made a
boo-boo.''
   But he insists Vohra pointed at the cedar and not the pine -
which Page says is perfectly healthy.
   And so the pine remains.
   Vohra, deprived of the trees that shielded his property from the
road, says he has ``a book on trees I'm going to give the state
highway people so they know what a tree looks like.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Europeans May Regret Farm Subsidy Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community may suffer major
political and economic damage by refusing to compromise in world
trade talks over U.S. proposals for deep cuts in farm subsidies,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   If it comes to an agricultural trade war with the EC, said
Yeutter, the United States is prepared to fight.
   Negotiations among 107 nations in the so-called Uruguay Round of
trade talks collapsed Dec. 7 in Brussels after the EC refused to
bend on U.S. proposals on major farm trade issues, including
cutbacks in internal price supports and export subsidies.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Brazil and other major
exporters, sought sharp reductions in subsidies, while the
12-nation EC, Japan and Korea were against the plan.
   Efforts are being made to reconvene the talks in mid-January,
but Yeutter said further negotiations would have little chance
unless the EC is prepared to change its hard-line stance.
   But Yeutter told reporters he thinks some internal pressures are
developing in favor of a reassessment of the EC position.
   Yeutter said he was Europe last week in the aftermath of the
Dec. 7 breakdown and found the community to be ``very embarrassed
by what happened in Brussels.''
   The community ``will probably not concede that publicly, but the
fact is they suffered a major geopolitical defeat in Brussels, with
essentially all of the world leaving with dissatisfaction and
disappointment in the EC position,'' he said.
   ``A lot of folks in Western Europe are chagrined by the present
status of the Uruguay Round and are concerned that the (EC) may
bear the lion's share of the blame for failure, should it occur,''
Yeutter said.
   Consequently, he said, a number of ``working level'' people in
the EC are trying to reassess the bloc's position in hopes the
stalled talks can be rejuvenated. But Yeutter said he didn't know
at this point whether this can translate into changes at the EC's
leadership level.
   ``I'm pessimistic about the potential outcome (of the talks) so
long as the community maintains its present intransigent stance,''
he said.
   Earlier, in a telephone news conference with broadcasters,
Yeutter he was not ready to tip off the EC what the United States
might do if the Uruguay Round of talks fail completely.
   But Yeutter predicted that the EC potentially could be forced
into spending all its allotted funds in 1991 trying to maintain
high supports and export subsidies to keep pace with the United
States.
   Of course, he said, the EC then could replenish its coffers but
``they would have to make a conscious decision'' to spend more on
agriculture than they do now.
   ``We'll be spending more money, too, of course, and we'll have
to find the financial resources to do that, and a lot of other
countries will, as well,'' he said.
   Yeutter also hinted at other possible U.S. trade actions in case
the trade talks fail but declined to be specific.
   ``I want them to be uncertain about what our response would be -
and a bit frightened by the potential,'' he said. ``So, I'm not
going to discuss publicly what the United States might do.''

<TEXT>
   An Indiana State University professor was
charged with murder today in the 1982 slaying of a 23-year-old man,
authorities said.
   Professor Robert David Little, 53, surrendered to authorities
hours after being charged with the murder of Steven Agan, said
Teresa Baker, secretary to Vermillion County Prosecutor Larry C.
Thomas.
   A hearing was scheduled later today.
   Little, chairman of the Department of Library Sciences at the
Terre Haute university, has denied any wrongdoing. University
officials said they would have no immediate comment on Little'
status.
   Convicted murderer Larry Eyler claimed last week that Little
assisted him in the 1982 mutilation slaying of Agan.
   Eyler was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1986 murder of
a 15-year-old Chicago boy. He is in jail awaiting sentencing in
Vermillion Circuit Court after pleading guilty to the murder of
Agan.
   Agan's body, with multiple stab wounds, was found Dec. 28, 1982,
in a field near Newport, about 40 miles north of Terre Haute. Eyler
testified Thursday he and Little were looking for a sexual
adventure when they spotted Agan and picked him up, eventually
driving to an empty house where the slaying occurred.
   Eyler, 37, was identified in court documents as a suspect in the
murders of 23 young men in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and
Wisconsin from 1982 to 1984.

   Los Angeles executives playing
Santa Claus sent a jet to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday carrying gifts
they thought U.S. troops need in the desert: designer sunglasses,
expensive cologne, toy cars and moisturizer.
   Troops watching the products being loaded onto trucks seemed a
bit perplexed.
   Gucci sunglasses?
   ``That's outta there. Pilots wear Ray-Bans,'' said Capt. Rick
Allison, 29, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with the 50th Tactical
Airlift Squadron.
   And 15,300 bottles of moisturizer?
   ``We're lucky to get a shower. Who needs moisturizer?'' said Lt.
Mike Smith, 30, from Little Rock, Ark., a member of the same
squadron.
   High-top sneakers that would cost $130 per pair?
   ``There you go. This is getting better. I need a size 10,'' said
Capt. Terry Isaacson, 28, from Duluth, Minn., another 50th squadron
man.
   The largesse was part of an effort by employees of MGM Grand
Air, who figured executives willing to pay $1,200 to fly from LA to
New York might donate some nifty gifts for America's armed forces.
   A two-week gift drive netted 15 tons of goods, which arrived by
jet Tuesday, so much that gift wrapping was dispensed with. Tons
more was left in the United States by ``Operation Desert Cheer''
and will be sent along later.
   There was something about the clothes, cassettes and personal
care products that said California. There was also something that
said the donors were a little unclear about the life of the troops
in the desert.
   One manufacturer sent pool cues. Another sent compact disks. A
third sent electric drip coffeemakers.
   Others were obviously more attuned to the troops' tastes.
   The list of items on the plane's manifest included Frisbees and
footballs and 2,000 music cassettes. The Los Angeles Lakers sent
hundreds of jerseys and an autographed basketball.
   One toy manufacturer send 7,200 Hot Wheels toy cars, saying it
had received requests from soldiers.
   ``I think they want to send them back to their kids in the
states,'' said Leigh Kimball, director of marketing for MGM Grand
Air.
   Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent a large
Christmas card, as did the Salvation Army.
   Mrs. Fields Cookies sent 20,000 of its confections.
   ``Those will be gone in a day,'' said Isaacson.
   One flight attendant, Patty Fonte, 25, of Los Angeles, took the
trouble to bake and wrap her own cookies, which were wolfed down by
troops on the tarmac.
   All at once, the troops realized there were several young female
flight attendants watching the goods being loaded onto trucks for
distribution in the desert.
   ``Hey, the stewardesses. Are they on the list?'' asked Isaacson.

   A judge, disclosing that he had been threatened,
revoked $300,000 bail for the man accused of killing Rabbi Meir
Kahane.
   State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger said there was a
strong likelihood that El Sayyid Nosair, 35, a native of Egypt,
would flee. Among them was a passport Nosair held in a different
name.
   The judge also noted that officials had found some cyanide in
Nosair's locker where he worked as a city heating maintenance man.
Schlesinger said the cyanide could be used to poison someone or
commit suicide.
   The $300,000 bail had been stayed by the judge pending today's
hearing, and Nosair had not been released.
   The judge said he believed prosecutors had a strong case against
Nosair, who is accused of gunning down the Jewish leader at a
Manhattan hotel on Nov. 5.
   During the bail hearing, the judge also disclosed that he
received numerous death threats and attempts to influence him via
telephone messages and mail.
   His admission prompted defense attorney Michael Warren to ask
that Schlesinger remove himself from the case, which the judge
promptly denied. Schlesinger said the threats and attempts to
pressure him would not affect his handling of the case.
   The next hearing in the case was set for March 4.

   ST-JEROME, Quebec (AP) - Thieves killed a security guard at a
Canadian Forces armory today, took 20 semi-automatic rifles from a
vault, then stole an army jeep to get away, police and the army
said.
   Police found the body of the security guard, Armand Robert, 67,
after responding to an alarm at the Royal 22nd Regiment armory.
Robert's head was wrapped in a plastic bag, said Capt. Guy Lizotte,
an army spokesman.
   About 100 weapons, including machine guns, are normally stored
in the vault, but only the semi-automatic rifles were stolen.
   Robert, who had worked at the armory for 17 months, was the only
guard on duty at the time and failed to make a scheduled telephone
check-in with military police early today, said Lizotte.
   ``He didn't report in and we couldn't reach him,'' he said
Lizotte. ``When we called municipal police they told us the alarm
had gone off at 2:14 a.m. When their police car arrived, they found
the murdered guard. Then they discovered the vault was opened.''
   The thieves stole a jeep from a garage beside the armory and
fled, police said. The vehicle was found nine hours later on the
outskirts of St-Jerome, 30 miles northwest of Montreal.
   There were no immediate indications as to who stole the weapons
or how many thieves were involved in the break-in, police said.
   There was no ammunition in the vault, Lizotte said.
   Robert was employed by a private security agency and was
unarmed, he said.

   Protesters tried to get to the hospital
room of right-to-die patient Nancy Cruzan to reconnect her feeding
tube today but guards halted them insidter
in the morning because some of the protesters blocked the stairwell
to the second floor, which also serves as a fire exit.
   State Trooper Dan Banasik, who helped remove protesters, said
all refused to give their names and said they would stay and fast
until Ms. Cruzan dies or her feeding tube is reinserted.
   Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel ruled last Friday that
Ms. Cruzan's parents could remove the feeding tube that had kept
their comatose daughter alive for seven years.
   Teel's ruling ended a landmark legal fight. He said he believed
there was ``clear and convincing evidence'' that Ms. Cruzan would
want to end her life.
   The protesters tried to get to Ms. Cruzan's second floor room at
the hospital.
   Most were blocked by guards in a stairwell and a shut-down
elevator. But 11 members of the group got to the second floor where
they were confronted by 15 police officers. They did not get into
Ms. Cruzan's room, where Joe and Joyce Cruzan were with their
daughter.
   The Rev. Ted Coleman, a Mount Vernon minister on chaplain duty
at the hospital, said the Cruzans were aware of the protests.
   ``They said they were aware. They said, `We're private people.
We just want to be left alone,''' he said.
   ``If you're going to kill her, just put a pillow over her
head,'' said one protester, who identified himself as Gary Tebbets
of Kansas City.
   Other protesters refused to give their names to reporters - all
identifying themselves as ``Nancy Cruzan.''
   The Rev. Joseph Foreman of Montreat, N.C., who announced Monday
he would lead 40 activists in an attempt to force-feed Ms. Cruzan,
was one of those arrested.
   ``The best we can do is not cooperate with anyone trying to
starve an innocent person to death,'' said Foreman, director of
Prisoners for Life, which he describes as a pro-life group.
   Foreman is director of Prisoners of Christ, a pro-life prison
ministry based in North Carolina.
   Dr. Ronald Cranford, a Mineapolis neurologist who had examined
Ms. Cruzan, said she would probably die within about two weeks of
the tube's removal.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a car accident near
Carthage on Jan. 11, 1983. Doctors have said her condition is
irreversible.
   Teel ruled in favor of disconnecting the tube in 1988. But the
Missouri Supreme Court overturned it. After the U.S. Supreme
Court's decision, the case was returned to Teel to determine if Ms.
Cruzan would want to be allowed to die.
   Ms. Cruzan suffers from seizures, vomiting, bleeding gums and
severely contorted limbs.

<HEAD>Private Program Aims to Create Housing for the Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary of housing and urban
development, Jack Kemp, announced on Tuesday a privately financed
housing program for the homeless that will be encouraged with
government tax breaks.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association is investing $10
million in the project, which will initially finance 600 units of
rental housing for homeless and low-income people around the
country.
   The program will target the homeless by, typically, creating
small apartments, including some with one room and a shared
kitchen.
   Both new buildings will be constructed and existing ones will be
rehabilitated.
   Rents will be based on the ability to pay and will be subsidized
with federal, state or local funds.
   This is the first time that low-income housing tax credits
enacted by Congress in 1986 have been aimed at helping the
homeless, said David Maxwell, FNMA's chairman and chief executive.
Companies can earn income tax credits by putting money in a newly
created investment fund, Corporate Housing Initiatives.
   While the bulk of the housing units will be for the homeless,
some will house physically disabled and elderly people with very
low incomes.
   The project is a ``progressive, bleeding-heart conservative
approach'' to the problem of homelessness, Kemp quipped at a news
conference.
   He said the program is an important step toward the goal of
involving the private sector in attacking one of the nation's most
serious social ills.
   FNMA's partner in the program is the Enterprise Foundation,
which will help homeless and low-income residents obtain
counseling, job training, child care and other services.
   Arranging social services as well as housing will provide an
added boost to help the homeless ``move up and out of poverty,''
said Enterprise Foundation founder James Rouse. ``We have to look
into deeper needs as well as provide housing.'' Local community
development groups will screen potential participants in the
program.
   The tax credits, which became law in 1986, have drawn $4 billion
in private capital and spurred the development of 125,000
low-income housing units.
   FNMA's $10 million investment is the first of what the new
initiative's sponsors hope will be many more corporate investors.
Regulated by HUD, FNMA is a congressionally chartered private
corporation supporting low- and moderate-income housing.
   Estimates of the number of homeless people in the United States
range from 300,000 to 3 million.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors found in a report in 1989 that the
lack of affordable, low-income housing was a main cause of
homelessness. Other causes were cited as unemployment, mental
illness and drug and alcohol abuse.

   President Bush said today he believes
Americans would support military action against Iraq if needed, but
he conceded that the support would erode if the battle became a
drawn-out one.
   ``The agony of Vietnam is still with us,'' Bush said at a news
conference.
   At the same time, Bush said he does not believe Iraq's Saddam
Hussein knows what he is up against.
   ``I think he basically is at best uncertain as to whether this
force will be used against him,'' Bush said.
   ``What is essential to get the peaceful resolution is that he
realizes he cannot prevail,'' Bush said.
   Referring to the inability to nail down a date for talks between
Saddam and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Bush said he was
``about where I was a couple of weeks ago'' when he proposed the
talks.
   Bush said he is still hopeful a date can be nailed down for
Baker to meet with Saddam Hussein.
   Bush was asked how long the public would support a war if Saddam
did not comply with a United Nations deadline of Jan. 15 for
withdrawing from Kuwait.
   ``I think that if the United States has to do its part to
implement the United Nations resolutions, I believe the country
would support that,'' Bush said.
   ``But I don't think that suppoprt would last if it were a long,
drawn-out conflagration. I think support would erode, as it did
during the Vietnam conflict.''
   But, Bush said, ``This will not be, in my view, that kind of
confrontation.''
   Bush was asked if he would initiate offensive action against
Iraq if necessary.
   ``I'm having the darndest consultations with Congress you've
ever seen,'' Bush said. ``I hope I don't have to cross that bridge
because I want a peaceful solution to that problem.''
   He heatedly rejected the argument that ``there's some kind of
racism in this deployment'' because of the disproportionate number
of blacks and other minorities serving there.
   ``I reject it out of whole cloth. It's simply not true...This is
the all-volunteer army,'' he said. He said the volunteers knew what
they were getting into when they signed up.
   Underscoring the impending deadline for Iraq's withdrawal, Bush
on Monday summoned ambassadors from 28 countries that have sent
forces to the Persian Gulf since the Aug. 2 invasion. The United
States alone has committed upwards of 430,000 troops.
   ``None of us wants war but none of us is prepared to accept a
partial solution,'' the president said. ``There can and will be no
negotiations for concessions and no rewards for aggression.''
   Referring to Saddam, Bush said, ``I think at some point he will
realize that this force, which is overwhelming, that is now being
arrayed against him would be devastating. ... That's what the
United Nations stated should happen, that he ought to get out or
all available means should be used.''
   In a decisive vote last month, the United Nations authorized the
use of all means necessary to evict Iraq from Kuwait unless it
pulls out by Jan. 15. ``And I want to see the United Nations
resolutions fulfilled right on schedule,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. Army planner said the service was ordering
some retired personnel to active duty for the first time since the
1961 Berlin crisis.
   An initial callup of 15 retired Army physician assistants was
approved last week, and about 200 more retirees probably will be
involuntarily recalled for active duty over the next month, said
Lt. Col. Henry H. Hanrahan.
   As the Jan. 15 deadline approaches, the Army and Navy have been
increasing their deployment of medical specialists and equipment to
the gulf area.
   Bush said he would not be opposed to Baker and Aziz meeting in a
third country to break the stalemate on scheduling. However, he
said, ``What I'm not going to do is shove these meetings right up
against the United Nations deadline.''
   Bush said Saddam ``does not understand the debate in this
country'' as members of Congress and former military leaders argue
that sanctions should be given more time to work before force is
used.
   ``He thinks it means that our country is divided and we cannot
go forward to do our part in implementing the U.N. resolutions,''
Bush said. ``And he's just as wrong as he can be.''
   Aziz had been due in Washington on Monday to meet with the
president. But that visit was put off when the two sides could not
agree on a date for a return meeting by Baker with Saddam in
Baghdad.
   Bush has said he wants Baker to meet with Saddam no later than
Jan. 3 while Saddam has proposed a Jan. 12 meeting.

   Actor Charlton Heston predicts that epic films
like ``Ben Hur'' or ``Lawrence of Arabia'' will soon be as obsolete
as silent movies.
   The movie, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' cost more than `Ben Hur,'
so that means they don't makemovies like that,'' Heston said in an
interview this week on the syndicated television show
``Personalities.''
   ``They will never make a `Lawrence of Arabia' again. They will
never make `Bridge on the River Kwai' again, which is too bad,''
Heston said. ``But we got to make those movies and I'm glad we did.
   ``People make fewer films now,'' Heston said.
   Heston, 67, also decried the high price of a movie ticket.
   ``You know, I just found out - because I get into a lot of
movies for free - that they're charging $7 to go to a movie in Los
Angeles now. Now, that's terrible.''
   Heston won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben Hur. The
film, about Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an
11-minute chariot race that Heston has said is the greatest action
sequence ever filmed.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Country entertainers Waylon Jennings and
Willie Nelson are joining forces to develop a club where they can
perform from time to time.
   The club, to be called ``Waylon and Willie's Cafe,'' will be on
the city's Mud Island tourist park which is undergoing renovation
as a companion project to the Great American Pyramid.
   The pyramid, a 32-story, stainless steel structure, is scheduled
to open next summer. Mud Island, a struggling nearby tourist park,
is being refurbished to become ``Festival Island.''
   The island and pyramid, though both owned by local government,
will be run by private companies controlled by businessman Sidney
Shlenker.
   Jennings, in Memphis for a performance Monday night, said the
club he plans with Nelson will have about 200 seats. Jennings said
he and Nelson will perform there several times a year, but he
didn't say exactly how many that meant.
   Mud Island is a three-mile-long sandbar in the Mississippi
River. Most of the island is being developed as residential
property.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Singer Julio Iglesias says he knows his
limitations and that means his world is on a sound stage, not a
movie set.
   Iglesias said he decided not to pursue an acting career because
``I am the worst actor on earth,'' the singer confessed in an
interview to be shown on ``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   ``I did a film 20 years ago and when I saw the film again, I
felt guilty and embarrassed,'' he said.
   ``I need to sing,'' Iglesias told Rivers, but ``I don't need to
spend two hours singing in a movie.''
   Iglesias admits he would ``love to do that - it's such a nice
situation to be an actor,'' but he says, ``I can't make it.''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Patrick Lilley, the actor who played Eddie
Munster in the 1960s television series, ``The Munsters,'' has
pleaded innocent to charges that he robbed his limousine driver
outside a suburban gas station.
   Lilley, 37, of Gardenia, Calif., entered the plea Monday before
DuPage County Circuit Judge Edward Kowal.
   The actor and John P. Sullivan, 32, of Chicago, were in a rented
limousine Nov. 2 when they allegedly robbed the driver of $140,
authorities said.
   Lilley, who used the stage name Butch Patrick in the hit
television series, was in the Chicago area making appearances at
Halloween parties and signing autographs for fans, police said. He
had been to two bars and was on his way to a Naperville hotel when
the robbery occurred.
   Police said no weapons were involved in the robbery.
   Sullivan also has pleaded innocent.

<HEAD>DEA Says Exhaustive Review Found No Evidence of Role in Flight 103
Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration told
Congress on Tuesday it reviewed more than 1,600 case files and
found nothing that would even remotely support news accounts that a
DEA undercover operation was entangled in the terrorist bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.
   The agency has consistently denied such reports, and the Justice
Department, after a month-long special inquiry, said Dec. 4 there
was no evidence to link the DEA and the December 1988 bombing,
which killed 270 people.
   ``I assure you that those allegations are unfounded and that DEA
had no part in this terrible tragedy,'' testified Stephen H.
Greene, DEA assistant administrator in charge of operations.
   The DEA denied such allegations a year ago, but they resurfaced
in October when both NBC and ABC reported that security at the
Frankfurt airport, where the New York-bound flight originated, had
been relaxed to accommodate DEA investigators who were tracking
U.S.-bound drug shipments. The suggestion was that terrorists had
taken advantage of the purported ``controlled delivery'' operation
to smuggle a bomb aboard the plane.
   Greene told the House Government Operations subcommittee on
government information, justice and agriculture that the agency, in
the wake of the latest reports, reviewed more than 1,600 case files
from 1984 through 1989 for any sign of an operation similar to the
one described in the media.
   ``This file review revealed nothing even remotely resembling the
alleged operation,'' he said.
   Greene told the subcommittee that security checks are never
bypassed in controlled delivery operations - in which agents allow
narcotics shipments to proceed to their ultimate destinations as a
way of tracing them to key pushers.
   Greene and David Westrate, assistant administrator in charge of
planning and inspection, scoffed at the notion that agents may have
acted outside of agency policy and allowed a package to bypass
security in defiance of rules.
   They said controlled deliveries are carefully run operations
involving many individuals at both departure points and
destinations as well as messages between American embassies and
Washington. As a result, such an operation could not be hidden by
an agent, they said.
   Greene said that in the fiscal years 1984 through 1989 the DEA
ran only three such operations through the Frankfurt airport and
none of them utilized a Pan Am flight. He said no controlled
delivery was in progress at the time of the bombing, which killed
259 aboard flight 103 and 11 persons on the ground in the village
of Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The news reports suggested that a DEA operation code-named
``Corea'' or ``Courier'' allowed the package containing the bomb to
bypass security.
   ``There was no operation code-named `Corea' or `Courier' or
anything similar to that name,'' Greene told the panel. ``DEA had
no operation under any name which facilitated the free movement of
drug couriers from the Middle East or Cyprus through Frankfurt an
onward to London and the United States.''
   ``On behalf of DEA, I would like to offer our sympathy to the
families of the victims of flight 103,'' Greene said. ``These
recent allegations against the DEA have just added to their
grief.''
   On Dec. 4, Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said the
Justice Department inquiry, which involved the FBI as well as the
internal DEA review, demonstrated that ``DEA had no investigative
or operational activity in effect on Dec. 21, 1988 that involved
the use of pan Am Flight 103 or Frankfurt International Airport.''
   Greene testified that in 1987 the DEA ran a controlled delivery
operation that traced a drug shipment from Lebanon to Cyprus to
Frankfurt to New York and finally to Cleveland. He said TWA flights
were involved but not Pan Am.
   Also in 1987, he said, German authorities in Frankfurt notified
the DEA of a narcotics shipment that originated in the Mideast. It
was allowed to proceed to Boston via Lufthansa, he said, where
arrests were made.
   In 1983, Greene said, Frankfurt authorities notified the DEA of
a shipment, which proceeded to Chicago via Lufthansa, then on to
Detroit aboard and American flight and finally to Toledo, Ohio,
where arrests were made.

   First Lt. Patricia Mills had put
in her papers to leave the Army before Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait. Now, she's the only woman briefing the U.S. military
command in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I just want to make a difference,'' said the 26-year-old
intelligence officer who grew up in North Salem, N.Y., but
currently lives in Atlanta.
   Immediately after the Aug. 2 invasion, she withdrew her papers,
at least until the Persian Gulf crisis ends.
   Since she arrived here in late August, Ms. Mills has been
working a 12-hour overnight shift tracking Iraqi ground movements
so she can brief Lt. Gen. John J. Yeosack, the army commander, in
the early morning.
   Despite her inside information, she said she doesn't know
whether there's going to be a war.
   ``Some days, I think it's going to happen and it's going to be
bad, but there are other days I think the longer it goes, the less
likely it is that they're going to shoot,'' she said.
   Every day except Sunday, Ms. Mills stands before an array of
strategic maps in the army's war room briefing Yoesack and his
staff for anywhere between five and 20 minutes. She also helps
prepare the morning intelligence summary.
   ``She is the only female daily `talking dog,' as briefers are
called in the military, and she's a damned good one - composed and
together,'' the senior Army ground intelligence officer in the gulf
said on condition of anonymity.
   ``She's clearly a top-flight performer. ... She's articulate,
quick and has a way of cutting through the fog of too much
information.''
   Ms. Mills said she has probably benefited from ``reverse
discrimination'' in her four-year army career because the military
is looking to promote women.
   She received airborne and air assault training following her
graduation from Cornell University in 1986, then became a platoon
commander in the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South
Korea.
   She spent a year at Army Forces Command Headquarters at Ft.
McPherson, Ga., before going to Panama, just before last Christmas'
U.S. military operation to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Ms. Mills said she sees a lot of similarities between Saddam and
Noriega, although Noriega ``hadn't built up his empire big enough
to protect himself.''
   Coming to Saudi Arabia and being selected to brief the high
command was ``a big thing,'' she said.
   ``They don't necessarily want to hear the tactical situation
from a woman,'' she said. ``Sometimes I think they'd just rather
look at me than look at some guy briefing them - but hey,
whatever.''
   Despite the kudos, she said she has a love-hate relationship
with the army.
   ``I think it's hard for women today in the army,'' Ms. Mills
said. ``I want an equal chance. It's hard because there are certain
things you have to do to get ahead, to be successful, and some of
those things aren't available to women.
   ``It's hard when you get up top. The old boy network takes over
sometimes.''
   Ms. Mills said she wants to move forward but isn't sure whether
to stay in the Army, work her way toward a command post or go to
business school and pursue a civilian career in international
relations.
   ``I'm really at the big spaghetti junction of life,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, she is jogging daily to relieve the stress of her
job, and she just bought herself a golf putter to practice in her
room.

   Peace Corps volunteers are expected to start
work next year in Laos in a ``symbol of the healing'' war wounds in
Southeast Asia, Corps Director Paul D. Coverdell said Tuesday.
   Top Laotian leaders approved the move in principle last week
when Coverdell visited the country, one of the poorest in the
world.
   It was the latest nation to be added in a record two-year
expansion of the 30-year-old organization in Asia, Europe, Africa
and Latin America.
   Coverdell said Laos and Mongolia - also scheduled to begin Peace
Corps operations in 1991 - would be the first countries under
Marxist rule to accept the U.S. organization.
   Talks are under way with China, Mozambique and Yugoslavia.
   Warsaw Pact countries began receiving Peace Corps volunteers
over the past year after shedding communist rule.
   Coverdell said James Lehman, corps director for Laos, will go to
Vientiane in mid-January to finalize details of the agreement,
which requires formal approval of the council of ministers.
   Lehman was Peace Corps director in the Philippines, where
operations were suspended after a communist insurgent group
abducted and later released a U.S. volunteer. Discussions on
resuming the program are continuing, Coverdell said.
   Plans to finalize a program for Bangladesh were postponed with
the recent forced resignation of President H.M. Ershad.
   Negotiations with China, interrupted by the 1989 crackdown
against the pro-democracy movement, are expected early next year,
Coverdell said.
   The Peace Corps has more than 6,000 volunteers in six dozen
countries.
   Volunteers returned this month to Panama, where the program was
suspended in 1971. The agency also plans to re-establish ties with
Nicaragua and Uruguay next year.
   Programs began this year in Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Haiti,
Hungary, Namibia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Sao Tome-Principe, a
country off the west coast of Africa.
   Final or tentative plans call for new or revived programs in
1991 in Romania, Bulgaria, Congo, Guyana, Mozambique, Nigeria, and
Uganda.
   In Laos, five specialists are expected to begin English teacher
training in June. The number of U.S. volunteers there could grow to
60, Coverdell said.

<HEAD>Physicists Recommend New Safeguards for Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New safeguards are necessary to prevent an
accidental nuclear explosion involving the nation's aging atomic
weapons, three leading physicists told Congress on Tuesday.
   ``It's not a dangerous system now, but we can make it safer,''
Sidney D. Drell, who headed the panel, said in testimony before the
House Armed Services Committee.
   There have been 32 accidents, only two in recent years, the
panel said, adding that was a relatively low number.
   Since the 1950s when tensions between the superpowers grew,
nuclear-weapon safety wasn't given the same urgency as
modernization of those systems, the panel said in its report.
   In addition, modification has moved slowly and, because of
budget limitations, the emphasis has been on acquiring new weapons.
   ``In anticipation ... many older ones remain in today's nuclear
stockpile that do not meet present nuclear weapons design
criteria,'' the report said.
   Recent technical advances have enabled scientists to use
supercomputers to trace the development of a nuclear detonation in
three dimensions rather than the previous limit of two, the report
said.
   ``A major consequences of these results is a realization that
unintended nuclear detonations present a greater risk than
previously estimated (and believed) for some of the warheads in the
stockpile,'' it said.
   The panel did not specify what the previous risk has been.
   Its members are Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center; Nobel laureate Charles H. Townes of the
University of California at Berkeley; and John S. Foster, head of
the Defense Science Board.
   The Armed Services Committee empaneled the three in May after
questions were raised about the safety of several nuclear weapons
systems, including the short-range, air-to-ground attack missile
known as SRAM-A.
   Since then, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has taken the SRAM-A
off Strategic Air Command alert bombers.
   The panel recommended, among other things, that all weapons be
equipped with modern enhanced nuclear detonation safety systems and
that all nuclear bombs on aircraft be equipped with insensitive
high explosives and fire-resistant pits within the weapons.
   A point of contention is the Navy's Trident D-5 missile, whose
nuclear warheads aren't equipped with insensitive high explosives.
The warheads also are located near a third-stage rocket motor,
which has a high energy propellant that could detonate in an
accident.
   Drell suggested redesigning the D-5 missile with the special
explosives and putting a non-detonable propellant in the rocket
motor.
   The panel also recommended the creation of a special adversary
group to examine and challenge nuclear weapons design; and a joint
advisory committee to report directly to the secretaries of Defense
and Energy.
   The agencies said in a one-page statement they would review the
recommendations and called the panel's goals ``consistent with both
departments' established priorities for safety.''
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services panel
on Department of Energy Nuclear Facilities, said the committee's
concern ``is not to condemn the nuclear community or establishment,
but to see that safety is pushed'' to the limit.

   Ninty-nine police recruits may have ants in
their pants to graduate, but the one thing holding them up is they
just don't have their regulation blue trousers.
   The city is running out of cash and the next payroll is in
doubt. To try to keep a bank balance, the city began deferring
certain payments, including the one to the supplier of the
regulation blue police uniform trousers.
   The Daily News says it's a case of ``pantemonium.''
   The supplier won't ship until it gets the check for the
regulation blues and the Police Academy says the officers can't
graduate in their cadet black trousers because they are no longer
cadets.
   Sgt. Terry Young, police spokeswoman, said graduation was first
postponed until Dec. 26, the actual date when the recruit training
program ends and the mayor and police commissioner can attend.
   Then it was delayed indefinitely until the pants arrive ``and we
are hopeful that won't be long,'' says Capt. Richard Delise.
   If the made-to-order trousers aren't delivered, Delise said
``they'll try to see if there are enough pants in stock, even if
not the exact made-to-measure sizes.''
   That would make the uniform complete, though maybe not as
spiffy.
   One unidentified recruit at the Police Academy said ``the mood
is pretty low. To have this happen right before graduation is a
real bombshell.''
   It's not the first time the city's money shortage has affected
operations at the Police Academy.
   The academy ran out of toilet paper earlier this month.

   A Greyhound bus collided with two
tractor-trailer rigs near the Wyoming state line today. Seven
people were killed and 16 were injured, authorities said.
   Summit County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Berry said five of the
injured were in ``very critical'' condition following the 9 a.m.
crash.
   Blaine Whimpe, a witness, said a westbound truck apparently slid
off Interstate 80 into the eastbound lanes, colliding with a second
truck and the bus.
   It appeared the bus turned on its side and slid about 150 feet,
he said, adding that the road condition was ``terrible.'' The
National Weather Service said there was snow and wind gusting to 29
mph at Evanston, Wyo., at the time of the crash.
   The injured were being treated at Evanston Regional Hospital
about 10 miles from the accident site, three or four with head
injuries, said Craig Rasmussen of LDS Hospital, a sister facility
in Salt Lake City.
   Two medical helicopters and a plane were sent from LDS Hospital,
he said.
   Greyhound dispatcher Bill Moore said the bus left Salt Lake City
at 8 a.m. en route to Chicago with more than 40 passengers aboard.
Greyhound inspectors were dispatched to the accident.
   The Wyoming Army National Guard armory in Evanston has been
opened for travelers who were on the bus, according to Sgt. Bob
June, unit administrator for Battery C, Third Battalion, 49th Field
Artillery.

<HEAD>Bucking Farmers' Group, Yeutter Says '90 Farm Law Should Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any serious effort in Congress to rewrite the
1990 farm law would be a big mistake, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Tuesday.
   Last week in Denver, the board of directors of the National
Farmers Union called on Congress ``to reopen and rewrite parts'' of
the five-year law passed this year.
   The NFU directors said the 1990 law will devastate family
farmers and rural areas unless changes are made.
   Yeutter told broadcasters in a telephone news conference that
``opening the farm bill would be a big mistake for everyone,
including the folks from the Farmers Union.''
   In the view of some critics, a problem with the 1990 legislation
is that it was subject to federal budget-cutting restraints. This
pared $13.5 billion from commodity program operations over five
years.
   One result was to reduce the amount of acreage eligible for
direct subsidies, or ``deficiency payments,'' under annual crop
programs. Critics say this will cut into farm income.
   ``In my judgment, U.S. agriculture came out very well in the
budget exercise, when one considers the circumstances under which
that bill was legislated,'' Yeutter said.
   But he added, ``There are still some folks in American
agriculture who believe that the $26 billion in federal subsidies
that was provided in 1986 ought to be the norm and that if they
just make a strong enough appeal in Washington, that would still be
possible.''
   That was a reference to the record $25.8 billion paid to farmers
in fiscal 1986 under Agriculture Department commodity programs.
Those payments since have declined to a fraction of that annual
rate.
   Yeutter said he sees ``no chance whatsoever'' that Congress
would return to the agricultural spending levels of the past.
Rather, he predicted that if lawmakers reopen the farm bill debate
the chances would be 50-50 that spending would be cut, not raised.
   Bob Denman, a National Farmers Union spokesman in Washington,
said no one had suggested that commodity spending be boosted to $26
billion a year over the five years of the law.
   But the NFU does believe some parts of the law can be
strengthened and adjusted to help protect family farmers more than
the 1990 act does.

   The official Soviet news agency said today a
telephone sweepstakes offering an American a chance to travel to
the Soviet space station was a hoax.
   But the president of the American company promoting the offer
said the Tass report referring to the sweeepstakes as a ``cosmic
canard'' was a misunderstanding.
   ``We basically have our contract in hand, so we know that we're
basically straight. it's just a matter of of us finding out what's
going on behind the scenes in the Soviet Union, to find out where
the confusion lies,'' said David Mayer of Space Travel Services.
   Glavkosmos, the Soviet equivalent of NASA, said it did not know
anything about the project, Soviet officials told Tass. Vladimir
Zenkin, deputy commercial manager at the Energia agency, said there
were no deals to allow an American to spend a week on the space
station Mir in 1992 or 1993. Tass referred to the sweepstakes as a
``hoax.''
   Space Travel Services offered callers to a 900-number a chance
to win six months' training, a trip aboard a Soviet rocket and a
week on the space station Mir. Entrants paid $2.99 a call. No-cost
entries can be sent by mail.
   Thousands of calls Monday, the first day the line was open,
overloaded the circuits. The line was working again early today.
   ``Space Travel Services Corp. has a legal contract with NPO
Energia for a trip to the Mir Space Station aboard a Soyuz
vehicle,'' spokesman George Nelson said. ``Two contracts are
involved. One between Space Travel and Space Commerce Corp. of
Houston and a second between Space Commerce and NPO Energia of
Moscow.''
   Mayer said the Tass report was ``obviously just a
misunderstanding and I don't think it will be that difficult to
clear up.''
   The winner, to be selected in a drawing in December 1991, was to
get the trip plus $500,000 in cash, or can forgo the trip and take
$1.5 million.
   ``Our long-term business strategy is to arrange for space travel
opportunities for anyone who wishes to go into space,'' said James
Davidson, senior vice president of Space Travel Services.
   ``To introduce this service and our company to the general
public, we've arranged for a little sweepstakes. The trip to the
Mir space station is the ultimate adventure.''
   Davidson said the company has signed a contract with Soviet
officials but refused to disclose the terms. Mayer said the company
would pay more than the $12 million paid the Soviets by the Tokyo
Broadcasting Service for a Japanese reporter's recent ride.
   Sergei Zavgorodny, a spokesman for the international department
of Glavkosmos, the Soviet equivalent of NASA, said he was unable to
confirm the deal.
   ``I know nothing about this lottery,'' he said, ``but the
Soviets are ready for commercial talks on launching any man into
the Mir station. The only question is whether the winner is
physically fit for the flight.''
   In Moscow, a secretary who answered the phone at Energia, the
Soviet rocket making company, said she knew there was an agreement
with an American company, but she did not know any details. She
said the person in charge was out of the office until Wednesday.
   Art Dula, whose Houston-based Space Commerce Corp. markets
Soviet space services in the United States, said he negotiated the
deal but also declined to release details.
   The Soviets, for a hefty price, have taken several passengers to
Mir, but never an American.
   Space Travel Services keeps more than 50 percent of the phone
charges and also hopes to sell advertising space aboard the
spacecraft.
   Company officials said they chose not to attempt such a project
with the National Aeronautics Space Administration.
   ``NASA has repeatedly made clear they they're not really
interested in opening up the shuttle to the general public and
definitely not for commercial purposes,'' Mayer said.
   The Soviets, however, ``realize there was a buck to be made and
that's what they want to do with their space program,'' he said.
   NASA spokesman Dave Garrett was reluctant to comment on the
competition.
   ``They're free to do what they want,'' he said. ``We certainly
don't have a monopoly on sending people into space. I don't think
we would ever do it on the basis of being selected by lottery,
though. We would do it on the basis of people having something
worthwhile to do.''
   Space policy analyst John Pike, a member of the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists and a critic of the U.S. space
program, was exuberant about the sweepstakes.
   ``That's fabulous. That's great,'' he said. ``Where can I buy a
ticket?''
   Because of local laws on sweepstakes, people listing addresses
in New York, Florida or Rhode Island are ineligible. The deadline
to enter is Dec. 1, 1991.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... a confrontation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And so, I think that if - if the United States had to do its
part to implement the United Nations resolutions, I believe the
country would support that. But I don't think there would - that
support would last if it were a long, drawn-out conflagration. I
think support would erode, as it did in the Vietnam conquest - I
mean, conflict.
   So - but I can understand why some young kid would ask that
question. I mean they keep hearing of this prolongation and that
there'd be stalemate and all of this kind of thing. I don't believe
that and one of the reasons that I moved this additional force, or
had it moved was because every individual life is precious and if
there had to be some confrontation, military, I would want to see -
be able to assure the parents and the families there is enough
force there to minimize the risk to every single American kid and
coalition kid - the Desert Rats, the French Legions, and the Arabs
that we'll be fighting side by side with. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, what prompted the administration's change of
thinking - some might less kindly say flip-flop - on the question
of whether financial aid can be targeted to minorities, and I have
a brief follow-up on that.
   A: I don't think there was any flip-flop on it. There was a
ruling made by a man of great integrity in the Department of
Education and when we heard about it here I expressed a certain
concern, asked that the policy be reviewed, and indeed today the
department issued a policy statement that is - that I think has Mr.
Williams, who was the promulgator of the original regulation - or
ruling - happy and yet it does do what I want to see and that is to
continue these minority scholarships as best we can.
   I met with a group of editors earlier on today and the question
comes up, ``Well, will there be a legal test?'' I am not a lawyer
and I don't know how the courts will rule. Eventually they will
rule on it.
   But as for now we have worked the regulation so that we can
continue to have these kinds of scholarships. I have long been
committed to them, I have long been committed to affirmative action
and so I hope the ruling, which is - some of it's quite technical,
will accomplish that end. But I would like to think that the matter
can be resolved with finality this way but I don't think that's
what we've done. I think it's going to be - I think there'll
probably be some court challenges to this. You wanted to follow up?
   Q: Yes, just briefly. I think there is some question how a
decision of that magnitude in the civil rights arena could have
been made without knowledge of the White House.
   A: Well, it was made without the knowledge of the White House
and I would simply refer you to Mr. Williams, who is a very able
attorney over there in the Education Department. I think he
explained that in his press conference. Yeah?
   Q: I'd like to ask you about the moral consistency of the U.S.
policy on Iraq. During the 1980s, Iraq waged an aggressive war of -
a brutal - a war of brutal aggression against a different neighbor,
Iran. It also used chemical weapons against Iranians and against
its own Kurdish population. It also worked on its nuclear program.
But rather than go to war against Iraq in that case, the United
States took Iraq's side.
   In the case of the chemical weapons, the Reagan and then the
Bush administrations opposed all efforts to impose sanctions in
protest against the use of chemical weapons. And in the nuclear
area, the United States condemned Israel for setting back Iraq's
nuclear program.
   So my question is, is it hypocritical now to threaten war over
conduct by the same regime when the similar conduct was condoned or
even supported against different adversaries in the recent past?
   A: No, I don't think it's hypocritical whatsoever. Here you have
the United Nations moving in concert. You have an unprecedented use
of the peace-keeping function of the United Nations, and I was very
proud that the United States was a leading component in what the
Security Council did. And it is true that our administration and
others previously tried to work with Iraq.
   But this brutal aggression, this - this - what they did here is
such a clear violation of international law that the entire world
was united in opposition to it. So, if there was a mistake made in
trying to move them along a more civilized path by having contacts
as we did, fine.
   But this kind of - this kind of revisionistic view that that
makes what's happening today wrong, I'm sorry, I don't agree with
it at all. And I think we're on the right path. I think the whole
world is united against this.
   And clearly, I'd like to have been clairvoyant so I could have
seen that the man was lying when he said he wasn't going to invade
Kuwait, which he did say. And he told Hosni Mubarak this, for
example. But we weren't quite that - it wasn't quite that clear at
the time. Yeah?

   Both the United States and Iraq on Tuesday expressed the
resolve, if not the wish, to fight a war in the Persian Gulf.
European nations refused to receive an Iraqi envoy unless the
Baghdad government talks with Washington.
   Less than a month before a United Nations deadline for Iraq to
relinquish Kuwait or face potential attack, President Bush said he
believed the American people would support a military strike.
   ``I think that if the United States has to do its part to
implement the United Nations resolutions, I believe the country
would support that,'' he told reporters in Washington.
   Bush acknowledged public backing would probably erode in the
event of a ``drawn-out conflagration'' but added: ``This will not
be, in my view, that kind of confrontation.''
   The Baghdad government, too, gave every indication it was
girding for war. Thousands of military reservists reported for duty
in the latest Iraqi callup, and the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council said Iraq was ``ready for the decisive showdown.''
   The Pentagon said Iraq had deployed another 10,000 troops in and
around Kuwait in the last week, bringing its troop total in the
area to 510,000. Iraq seized the emirate 4{ months ago.
   An additional 10,000 American troops arrived in the region
during that time, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. U.S.
troops in the gulf will number more than 400,000 by mid-January.
Nations allied with the United States in a coalition against Iraq
now have about 220,00 troops in the area.
   That coalition reaffirmed its solidarity on Tuesday. European
Community foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, refused to meet
with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz unless he first goes to
Washington for talks.
   ``Europe does not want to lend itself to any bid by Iraq to
drive a wedge between the EC and the United States,'' said Dutch
Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek.
   Aziz had been tentatively set to go to Washington on Monday, but
the visit was canceled after the United States and Iraq were unable
to agree on a date for subsequent talks in Baghdad between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Saddam.
   Baker, also in Brussels to meet with NATO allies, said the
United States would not object to a European meeting with Aziz, as
long as no ``mixed signals'' were sent about the allies' position.
   He said Saddam ``may well attempt further diplomatic
sleights-of-hand in the days ahead,'' but ``we are all agreed that
we must not allow his manipulations to divert us.''
   The Bush administration has told Saddam not to stage a partial
withdrawal from Kuwait as a ploy.
   Even with Baker's go-ahead to hold talks with Iraq, the
Europeans said seeing Aziz - who had been invited before the
U.S.-Iraqi talks were derailed - would send the wrong signal to
Baghdad.
   ``We maintain the pressure on Iraq,'' said Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, the community's executive
body.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the EC was only trying to
appease the United States.
   Iraq has tried to set Jan. 12 as a date for the Baker-Saddam
meeting. The United States says that is too late, because it comes
only three days before Jan. 15. After that date, the Security
Council has authorized using ``all necessary means'' to force Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   Even if the U.S.-Iraqi talks get back on track, a Turkish report
quoted Saddam as saying they would be useless if the American side
merely reiterates Security Council resolutions demanding a full
pullout.
   ``We would not go to the United States to get orders,'' Saddam
told a Turkish television journalist. ``If Bush is going to repeat
to us the U.N. decision (calling for a complete withdrawal), there
is no need to go there.''
   The Bush administration has said urging Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions would be the principal focus of any talks.
   ``We have already read them, we know them and we rejected
them,'' Saddam said, referring to the resolutions. The interview
was to be broadcast this week on state Turkish television, and
excerpts were released Tuesday.
   In Iraq, thousands more reservists reported to their army units
Tuesday as part of a major military mobilization. Most of the
reservists involved in the latest callup served during the 1980-88
war with Iran.
   Iran, meanwhile, had some words of warning for its old enemy.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted President Hashemi
Rafsanjani as saying the Baghdad government would have itself to
blame if it were attacked.
   ``We are feeling very uneasy over the fact that the Iraqi people
may be hurt by the Americans,'' Rafsanjani told a group of
students. But he added: ``The responsibility for this rests with
the Iraqi regime.''
   In other developments:
   -Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, were to leave Tuesday night for
Saudi Arabia to talk with officials and meet with troops.
   -Prince Charles will visit British troops in the gulf this
weekend, Buckingham Palace said Tuesday. Princess Diana will not be
with him, but she will fly to Germany Wednesday to visit families
of British soldiers serving in the gulf region, the palace said.
   -Soviet Mideast envoy Yevgeny Primakov said the departure of
2,500 Soviet workers from Iraq has been delayed only by technical
matters and the desire of many to remain until their contracts
expire. There had been speculation Baghdad was trying to hold the
Soviet contract workers as hostages.

cartel, surrendered to authorities Tuesday in northwest Colombia,
local radio reported.
   Ochoa, 33, became the first cartel leader to turn himself in,
accepting a government offer of no extradition and reduced jail
sentences for drug traffickers who surrender, RCN and Caracol radio

   Christmas discounting, a sluggish housing
market and a sharp moderation in the rise of energy prices combined
in November to dampen inflation to 0.3 percent, the government said
Tuesday.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index represents an annual inflation rate of just
3.7 percent, down sharply from the 8.9 percent inflation rate
during the three months after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The improvement allowed the Federal Reserve Board to take
dramatic action to stimulate the economy and cushion the effects of
the recession most private economists believe the nation has
entered.
   The central bank cut its key bank lending rate, known as the
discount rate, from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, effective Wednesday.
The move, announced about 30 minutes before the close of trading on
Wall Street, sent stock prices surging. It was the first cut since
August 1986.
   Lower interest rates help the economy by making it cheaper for
individuals and businesses to borrow. But, by stimulating demand,
that tends to increase inflationary pressures.
   ``The Fed ... needs to be worrying about the economy going down
more than it needs to be worrying about inflation right now,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch in New York.
   Evidence that the economic downturn, including slow Christmas
sales, is restraining prices was sprinkled throughout Tuesday's
report, analysts said.
   Clothing costs fell 0.2 percent for the second consecutive
month; home furnishing prices dropped 0.7 percent. And
entertainment commodities inched down 0.1 percent. That includes
most televisions, radios and other electronic equipment given as
gifts.
   ``Retailers are making sales, but they're doing it at discount
prices,'' said economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York. ``Sale prices are much more
widespread and floor traffic appears to be much less dense than
before past Christmases.''
   Prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors, taken by
economists as the best measure of underlying price pressures, also
rose a moderate 0.3 percent, the same as in the previous two
months.
   The effect of sluggish housing markets and even home price
declines in some regions showed up in homeowners' monthly payments,
which remained unchanged in both November and October. They account
for $1 of every $5 spent by consumers.
   Brusca and other economists said the underlying trend toward
tamer inflation had been masked by the shock to energy prices after
the Persian Gulf crisis began.
   But in November, energy prices rose only 0.5 percent after
jumping 15.1 percent over the previous three months.
   ``The oil bubble has really pretty well passed through now,''
said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Corp. in
Chicago. ``We're going to have some rather pleasant readings,
temporarily, on the reverse side of the bubble.''
   Gasoline prices rose 0.3 percent after a 7.7 percent jump in
October. Fuel oil prices, which increased 50.8 percent in the
preceding three months, fell 3.8 percent in November. But natural
gas costs were up 3.2 percent and electricity charges rose 0.6
percent.
   Inflation of prices for services, as opposed to goods, has
reacted less strongly to the slowing economy. Medical care, for
instance, rose a hefty 0.8 percent in November and was 9.4 percent
more expensive than a year ago. Overall, they were up 0.4 percent.
   Other higher-than-average price increases included:
   -New cars, up 0.6, but only the third rise in 10 months.
   -Airline fares, up 3.6 percent in November and 8.4 percent over
the past three months after the rise in aviation fuel.
   -Tobacco, up 0.7 percent for the month and 11 percent over the
past year.
   Food and beverage prices rose 0.4 percent, pulled up by a large
2.7 percent increase in fruit and vegetable prices. The cost of
beef, pork, fish and eggs also rose. However, prices fell for
poultry, cereal and bakery products and dairy products.
   ``Especially in the West, it was very, very dry and we struggled
with the fall (fruit and vegetable) crops,'' said economist Donald
Ratajczak of Georgia State University. ``But unless we have a big
freeze, that shouldn't continue.''
   The various changes put the index for all consumer goods and
services at 133.8 in November. That means a hypothetical selection
of goods and services that cost $100 on average in the 1982-84 base
period cost $133.80 last month, up from $125.90 a year ago.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' real
earnings increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent. Still, over
the past year, wages have not kept pace with inflation. Average
weekly earnings for both full-time and part-time, non-supervisory
workers were $348.49 in November, up 3 percent from a year ago.
   For the first 11 months of the year, consumer prices rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 percent - the worst rate
since 1981 and well above last year's 4.6 percent rate.
   However, economists expect the inflation rate to subside to
between 3 percent and 4 percent next year as the slumping economy
further weakens demand and as oil prices turn down.

<HEAD>Curfew Shuts Most of Taj Mahal City, Seven Killed Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AGRA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half the city that is home to the
Taj Mahal was under curfew Tuesday after three days of riots
between Hindus and Moslems, but the 17th century architectural
masterpiece reopened to tourists.
   At least 11 people were killed and 49 injured in Agra in riots
that were the latest in a wave of sectarian clashes to have swept
several cities across India, claiming at least 307 lives in 12
days.
   Residents stood watch on rooftops and alleys near the Taj Mahal,
ready to sound alarms at the first sign of trouble. A curfew was in
force in eight of Agra's 15 districts, police said.
   Elsewhere Tuesday, two people were stabbed to death in the
southern city of Hyderabad and five people were killed in the
western city of Ahmedabad, Press Trust of India reported. At least
16 people were injured in a bomb explosion, and 14 people were hurt
in stabbings and stone throwing in Ahmedabad.
   Two weeks ago, a Hindu fundamentalist group revived a plan to
build a temple on a site already occupied by a mosque in the sacred
town of Ayodhya, 250 miles east of Agra.
   The temple campaign caused sectarian clashes in at least 12
other towns, the most violent in Hyderabad, more than 620 miles
south of Ayodhya.
   Although Hindu-Moslem clashes have occurred frequently since
India's independence in 1947, the brutality of the attacks this
time numbed the country.
   In several towns, babies and women were targeted by masked men
who roamed at night, defying police and a curfew to hack their
victims with axes or to stab them with swords, knives and daggers.
   In Hyderabad alone, 28 children were among the 151 people killed
since Dec. 7. More than 100 people have been killed in 11 towns of
Uttar Pradesh state, where Agra and Ayodhya are located.
   Agra residents said it was the first time sectarian clashes took
place in their city of 1.4 million people. Thirty-five percent of
Agra's population is Moslem. Most of the rest are Hindu.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million
people. Hindus account for 82 percent.
   Agra officials said many Moslems in the town fled their homes
after Hindu mobs set them on fire. About 600 took shelter in a
school, said Ahmed Hassan, a city councilman.
   ``All these people have lost their property. Most of their
houses have been burned or destroyed,'' said Hassan, a Moslem.
   Mohammad Abdul, the 65-year-old owner of an iron factory in a
predominantly Hindu neighborhood, said his Hindu neighhors urged
him to stay when the clashes erupted, assuring him that he would be
safe.
   But ``they also stoned us when the trouble started,'' Abdul said
at the school where he had taken shelter. ``We are still in a
dangerous position. We don't know what will be in the future.''
   About a dozen foreign tourists went to the Taj Mahal Tuesday
morning.
   On a normal day, hundreds of people flock to the white marble
mausoleum, built by Mogul Emperor Shahjahan in 1648 in memory of
his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to his 14th
child.
   The manager of a luxury hotel nearby said he had 80 percent
occupancy before the trouble started. On Tuesday, it was 6 percent
and most guests were journalists, said the manager, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday with regional reporters in the Old Executive
Office Building.
   President Bush: Let me just make a quick comment, and then I'll
be glad to take some questions.
   But I want to just comment once again on the situation in the
Gulf, because, you see, ever since Aug. 2, the world community has
been virtually united in its condemnation and in its rejection of
Iraqi aggression.
   I've been talking about the Security Council resolutions, but
the General Assembly of the United Nations, with only one vote
against it - Iraq - joined in condemning what has gone on by Saddam
Hussein, and I think that's a very significant point, because those
who were saying, ``Well, it's only the Security Council'' now have
to recognize that what we've been saying all along is true, that it
is not Saddam Hussein against - and the Arab world against the
United States, but indeed it is - it is Saddam Hussein against the
rest of the world.
   And so, I mention this because we're coming down towards this
UN-mandated deadline. I still want to see a peaceful solution to
this question. You keep hearing about new initiatives, President
Bendjedid of Algeria, but I gather that that has gone about as far
as those initiatives that others have undertaken. Bendjedid, good
credentials on all sides of this dispute, but unable to talk sense
to Iraq's dictator.
   So, I would just simply say that we will keep trying to find an
answer. It cannot be an answer of concession. It cannot be an
answer where Saddam Hussein is rewarded with one single concession,
because that would fly right in the face of the rejuvenated United
Nations peace-keeping effort and it simply is unacceptable, not
just to us, but to the rest of our coalition partners.
   And you look at what the EC said yesterday - or today I guess it
was - regarding the visit of Tariq Aziz, when they said there would
be no point in his coming to see them unless the visits with the
United States had taken place. It shows a real solidarity, because
the temptation might have been the other way.
   So, I think the coalition is holding. We are determined, more
determined than ever.
   Yesterday I had a meeting with 27, I believe it was, other -
ambassadors from other countries. The 28 standing together in the
gulf represented a show of solidarity that I think was read loud
and clear halfway around the world.
   So, that's where we are, and there is no news to report on the
proposed Secretary of State's visit - the visit of the Secretary of
State to Baghdad or indeed of the Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
coming here.
   So, with no further ado, I'd be glad to take questions on any
subject. Yeah? Let me get these first. One, two.
   Q: Are you more optimistic or less optimistic at this point
about the possibilities of going to war compared to when you made
the proposal to send Mr. Baker to Iraq?
   A: Well, if I had to quantify my degrees of optimism or
pessimism, I'd say it's about in the same mode as when it was
there. I do not believe that Tariq Aziz (sic), one, knows - or has
digested what he's up against in terms of this - of this coalition
force, and secondly, I think he basically is at best uncertain as
to whether this force will be used against him. And so, I can't -
what I think is essential to get the peaceful resolution is that he
realizes that he simply cannot prevail. So, I guess I'm about where
I was a couple of weeks ago when I made that proposal. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to ask you a question that one of our
readers of the Detroit Free Press suggested I ask you. And it's
from an 18-year-old from Birmingham, Mich. His question is if the
war in the gulf escalates, how will you get the American people to
support the war? And it's a common theme of our readers' questions.
It seems to ask whether you think the American public is as willing
to accept war as an option as your policies seem to be.
   A: I'm out - I don't want war as an option; I want peace as an
option. Secondly, I think some of those questions stem from the
fact that some believe this, quote, ``will be another Vietnam,''
unquote. And the agony of Vietnam is still with us.
   People remember a protracted war. They remember a war where
individuals were asked to fight with one hand tied behind their
back, in essence. This will not be, in my view, that kind of a
confrontation.

<HEAD>`Goodfellas' Named Best Film By New York Film Critics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mafia film ``GoodFellas,'' its director,
Martin Scorsese, and its co-star, Robert De Niro, won top awards
Tuesday from the New York Film Critics.
   ``GoodFellas,'' based on Nicholas Pileggi's book ``Wiseguy,''
about a hood named Henry Hill who turns on his former pals and
joins the federal witness protection program, was named best movie
of the year by the group, comprising 28 critics for New York-based
publications.
   Scorsese was named best director for ``GoodFellas.'' De Niro was
named best actor for his work in that film and in ``Awakenings,''
in which he plays a coma patient who awakens years later.
   Ruth Prawer Jhabvala won for best screenplay for ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge,'' the story of an affluent mid-America family starring Paul
Newman and Joanne Woodward. Woodward, who plays Mrs. Bridge in the
film, was named best actress.
   The best supporting actress award went to Jennifer Jason Leigh
for ``Miami Blues'' and ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' a harsh and
startling look at the Brooklyn waterfront during the 1950s.
   Bruce Davison of ``Longtime Companion,'' a poignant portrait of
a group of homosexual friends living through the AIDS crisis, won
the award for best supporting actor.
   The critics gave an award for best first film, to Whit Stillman,
director of ``Metropolitan,'' about the existential meanderings of
Park Avenue preppies.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, on the question of the economy, you yourself
have mentioned that you would support some economic stimulus
perhaps, and I'm wondering if in the new year you're going to
propose any tax cuts, capital gains in particular, or perhaps a cut
in the payroll taxes for Social Security?
   A: Well, I haven't changed my view on the fact that capital
gains would be stimulative and not costly to the taxpayer. I am hit
regularly on the fact that this is a tax break for the rich. I
don't believe that.
   But the problem you have on this is that we have under this
budget agreement, rigid caps and we have to score capital gains
under existing law the way, I think it's the CBO or the Joint
Committee or somebody, says it has to be scored. So we're talking
about a $20 billion hit.
   What I'd love to think is that we could change the way we score
it to a more realistic - I would say realistic view - the
Treasury's view, for example, that shows this would lift people up,
would encourage investment and would not be a revenue loss.
   So I haven't given up on my philosophical commitment to the idea
that capital gains would stimulate growth. And when you have a slow
or - certainly a slowed-down economy, in some areas recessional -
it would be good. But we're faced with this practical problem as to
what we can do, not just on capital gains, but on other stimulants
that cost money. There is, remember, an enormous stimulant; one
that I'm not very happy about, and that is about a $300 billion
federal deficit.
   So I don't know where we're going to come down on our State of
the Union message. But in concept of growth and opportunity, I can
guarantee you the emphasis is going to be on that. And if I can
find a way to change this - this stultified thinking that this is -
this is deficit creating, a capital gains cut, why, then, I'd be
all for that. So we're looking at it; I don't know where we're
coming out on it.
   Q: Are you sympathetic to the idea of cutting the Social
Security payroll tax at all?
   A: Well, if I can figure out a way to pay for it. One of the
good things about the deficit agreement that was very controversial
and which had a lot of - you know, for which I got a reasonable
amount of criticism, I'd say, is that you have to pay for these
things. And whether the same argument can be made; I haven't seen
the dynamic argument made on that that I have on capital gains.
   So I just don't know the answer to that one. If the offsets were
there, you might. I'm a little worried - I'll be honest with you -
having laid this - this tax question down for a while to reopen
many, many aspects of it. I've tried to draw the exception because
I feel so strongly on the capital gains account. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, Saddam Hussein knows, and you know, that his
best shot at cracking the cohesion of the coalition arrayed against
him is to draw Israel into it by direct attack or otherwise.
General Scowcroft indicated that there have been specific
discussions with the Israelis and the coalition partners about that
contingency. Can you tell us whether there's been any assurance or
commitment, either by the Israelis or our coalition partners, that
they would not crack apart if that were to happen?
   A: If - he -
   Q: If he attacked Israel.
   A: If he attacked Israel? I'm convinced the coalition would not
fall apart. I can't give you the specifics on it, but I'm
absolutely convinced of it, and you can assume, the way I've
answered the question, that we've - we've inquired about that.
   Secondly, Israel has had a - what I would call a ``low-profile
position'' on all of this, for which I salute them. It is not easy.
They have - their - their security they feel could well be at stake
from some radical act by Saddam Hussein. But I have no argument
with Mr. Shamir over the way that the Israelis have conducted
themselves, nor do I think that the coalition partners, on that
particular point, regardless of what their historic relationship
with Israel may have been. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, as the Cold War began to wind down, first in
Congress and then in your own administration, there was talk of a
peace dividend. And, in fact, on the very day that Saddam Hussein
invaded Iraq, you gave a speech in which you proposed a major shift
in the structure of the American military, a 25 percent drawdown
over the next five years. With the way the force has been stretched
in Operation Desert Shield, are you rethinking that? As this ends,
are you going to have to take another look at whether that big a
reduction in our active-duty military force is actually possible in
a post-Cold War world?

<TEXT>
   A: I believe we will be able to live with the reductions, and
they were substantial, that have been worked out in the last budget
agreement. And I think the fact that we have been able to move this
much force this dramatically is, of its own weight, a very - a
marvelous thing.
   But as we restructure the defense and as defense has taken
substantial hits, not, I would argue, in a peace-dividend mode, but
just more of a fiscal mode, I think we can - I think I will be able
to represent to the American people that we will still have this
ability to rapidly deploy the best-trained forces in the world. So
- yeah?
   Q: If this crisis had occurred five years from now, when this
drawdown that's been agreed on had already been largely completed,
would your options have been as unlimited as they are now?
   A: Good question, and I'm not sure I can answer it. But, if the
question is, would we have been able to deploy this much force this
rapidly, I think the answer is yes. I'd want to hedge just a little
bit, but I think it is yes. Gen. Scowcroft is shaking me off a
little. (Laughter.) But - because we were talking about this with
Gen. Powell and General - and Dick Cheney. But this is not the -
you know, this is not the average disturbance, you might say, that
calls for the average deployment of force; this is pushing it up to
the edge of the envelope.
   But I think the answer is yes. I'd like - wish I could get back
to you to be sure I'm not misleading you, but I felt comfortable
when we had the briefing from Cheney and Powell - I think it was
yesterday - on this question. Yeah, way back there.
   Q: Yes. Will the - will the forces that have been taken out of
Germany and deployed to the Gulf be sent back to Europe once this
crisis -
   A: I'm not sure of the answer to that question. I can't answer
it. I don't know. But one thing I will say about them is the
earliest day possible, I would like to have every single American
soldier out of the Gulf, for a lot of reasons. And I'd - I think
that - in the first place, I think the status quo ante, the return
to where we were before Saddam invaded his neighbor, is
unacceptable. Because I think you're going to see a cry for
stability and order there, security and stability that cannot be
met simply by a return to the pre-invasion borders or the status
quo there.
   So, I think you're going to have to have some kind of
peace-keeping force, and I think we're going to have to cope with
the question this gentleman raised of nuclear - increased nuclear
capability today beyond what it was several years ago.
   And so, we're - it won't be just the way it was before. And -
but I would like to think it would be with some international
peacekeeping force, because I think there's a problem if US forces
remain on the ground in the Gulf for some time. This is - I don't
feel that way about naval forces. We've been there for a long time;
we will continue to stay there, our mission being to protect
freedom of passage through the Straits of Hormuz, and we have a
history there of helping keep the peace and of keeping the Straits
open.
   So I would not see any change in that force. But on whether
these forces return to Germany, we've got - I think we'll have some
- obviously, you know, might be different people - but we're going
to have some big discussion over levels in post - post-Iraq forces
in Europe. We're discussing that anyway right now.
   Staff: One more question.
   Q: Mr. President, are you -
   A: Make it four more - one, two, three, four. No, you regulars,
no. (Laughter.) Four - one, two, three, four.
   Q: Mr. President, are you prepared to initiate offensive action
against Iraq without a declaration of war from Congress?
   A: I'm having the darnedest consultations with Congress you've
ever seen. I was very pleased when the leaders, at the last
meeting, told me that it was the best in terms of consultation
they've been - ever had, and I'll continue to do that. And I will
look at - I hope I don't have to cross that bridge, because I want
a peaceful solution to this question. But there are so many
contingencies that it's very difficult to answer that question in
one definitive way. And I'm not going to try. Yes?
   Q: An article in the recent issue of Time magazine, Mr.
President, says that no one in your Cabinet has a child serving in
Saudi Arabia, and that a disproportionate number of U.S. troops
stationed on the front line hail from minorities and the working
class. Is this accurate? And if it is, why does this condition
exist?
   A: Well, I don't know about the profligacy of my - I mean the
proliferation of my Cabinet and where their children are, but I - I
don't have any service-age kids myself. But I don't think this
concept, that this is a discriminatory army, or an army that is
discriminating and thus sending more blacks to their fate, or
minorities, Hispanics, or something, is proper. I've heard it, and
I reject it. And the reason I reject it is, we have an all
volunteer army.
   We have great opportunity in this army. We have the finest kids,
the best trained, the best motivated, the high achievers - not the
low achievers. And so this argument that there's some kind of
racism, which I think your question implies, in this deployment, I
reject it out of it's - the whole cloth.
   It is simply not true. And if you don't believe me, believe
Colin Powell; and he has pretty good credentials in this field,
outstanding credentials. So I want to gun it down just as hard as I
possibly can and I don't know about my Cabinet, I am sorry I can't
answer that. I just don't know where their kids are. Yeah.

<TEXT>
   Row, row, row your boat - all the way to
work.
   That's Marshall McGregor's idea of the best way to beat the
commute backup on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
   McGregor, 36, wants to form a catamaran club of several men and
women who like the idea of grabbing an oar and rowing across the
bay every morning and night. And are willing to pay for the
privilege.
   Depending on the route, the trip could run four to seven miles
each way.
   ``I'm looking for some athletically minded commuters who would
want an alternative commuting club that combines a health club with
mass transit,'' said McGregor. ``The bay is a great source for
transportation - you don't have to build any roads or rails, and
it's free.''
   McGregor's vision includes four or five 35-foot aluminum-hulled
catamarans complete with canopies to protect oarsmen and women from
saltwater spray. Rowers would depart from points in Berkeley,
Emeryville or Oakland, he said, and arrive near the Ferry Building
in San Francisco.
   To complete the picture, McGregor needs crews of sporting types
willing to change from business togs into sweats for the transbay
row. Shower facilities would be available at the other end, he
said.
   But there are plenty of details yet to be worked out, including
costs.
   ``With the rowing club you no longer have to spend the extra
time each day going to a health club, and you've avoided sitting on
the Bay Bridge for 45 minutes,'' he said.

   Once the haven of German speedsters, the autobahn
is now plagued by traffic jams and clogged with slowpoke sedans. As
if that weren't enough, the government said Tuesday it wants to
charge money to use the highway system.
   The Bonn government, seeking cash to finance German unification,
agreed in principle to charge an annual fee to use the 6,325 miles
of autobahn. However, concerns about violating European Community
agreements prevented the Cabinet from reaching a final decision.
   ``We don't want to decide on something that isn't fully
guaranteed,'' said Volker Ruehe, the No. 2 official in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. He did not specify the
possible conflict.
   Some say the autobahn fun - the days of blasting down the
highway for hours at a stretch with no speed limit to rein in your
Mercedes, Porsche or BMW - is already over.
   Traffic jams abound, some extending as long as 35 miles,
construction causes delays and there are speed limits near cities.
And puttering eastern German Tabants, along with Ladas, Skodas and
other East European makes, get in the way of western German power
cars.
   Under the autobahn fee plan, passenger vehicles would pay $66 a
year, with higher amounts for trucks and buses. Motor vehicles
would sport an annual sticker to show the owners had paid.
Foreigners would not be exempt.
   Protests already are being heard.
   The German automobile club ADAC said the fees would amount to a
``clear break'' of Kohl's promise not to raise taxes to finance
unification.
   Kohl had indeed made such a promise, but he also made clear that
he planned to raise ``fees'' to finance the historic merger.
   That in turn has led to a debate over what is a fee and what is
a tax, in a country where ordinary workers already hand over more
than 40 percent of their salaries to the government or
government-mandated social programs.
   Even the railroad workers union criticized the autobahn plan,
saying it amounted to an unfair tax that ``fails to take account of
the individual's ability to pay.''
   Yet the Germans will pay one way or another, as the expensive
rebuilding of eastern Germany goes forward. Besides the autobahn
fee, the government already has plans to raise the cost of
telephone calls.

   Q: You've spoken of this -
   A: This is an all-volunteer Army. They are not draft-dodging.
Remember Vietnam and the allegation, which I think had a lot of
truth to it, that the kid that got disproportionately there was the
guy that couldn't get the exemption and that came out of the - you
know, kind of the lower rungs of society. This is different!
Totally different, yeah. And we ought to get you figures on this
because it is very, very important as to how high a quality this
Army is.
   And you'll read about one or two that say, ``Well, I didn't sign
up to do this, I signed up because I thought I could get a free
education.'' He gets on the Phil Donahue Show, a big hero, but
that's a - that's the tiny fraction of these kids that are over
there.
   The morale is good and they are motivated and they are
well-educated and they are dedicated, and if you'll excuse an
old-fashioned reference, they are patriotic. And so it isn't some
cop out armed services that they are now getting caught up in
something that they were unaware of. I am glad we got that one
because I really feel strongly on that question. Yeah?
   Q: You've spoken of this crisis as being not the U.S. against
Iraq but rather the world against Iraq.
   A: Yes.
   Q: And I'm wondering then why the talks with Baghdad aren't
being conducted by the Secretary General of the UN but rather by
the American Secretary of State?
   A: Good question. And the answer is the Secretary General, as
you may recall, tried and he went to Baghdad - or I think it was in
Baghdad, maybe it was in Amman, but he went there and he went to
talk within his mandate, and his mandate were the UN resolutions.
This was before 678 or whatever the last one was.
   So he has tried hard and I salute him for that. And he would be
willing - I talked to him about this in Paris - while I'm up for
your question - and when we were over there for the CSCE meeting,
and I asked him. He's an old friend of mine, he and I were UN
Ambassadors at the same time, and I said, ``Javier, do you think it
would be worth trying this again? We're all trying for the extra
step.'' He said, ``If I felt we could make some progress within my
mandate I certainly would try again.''
   But it's not that people haven't tried. I referred you to - just
touched on it in passing about Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria. You've
heard over and over again various people calling, as King Hussein
of Jordan did, for an Arab solution. You had Tariq Aziz go to
Moscow to talk. It isn't though people haven't tried. It is simply
that as recently as today, I think it was - the last wire clip I
saw - Saddam Hussein is still referring to a nation that is a
member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations as
``Province 19 of Kuwait.''
   And therein lies the difficulty. It isn't that people haven't
tried to go the extra step, but I have to give the UN credit for
having - the Secretary General - for really having tried on this
one, and I'm sure he's quietly tried as well as through this public
mission that he undertook.
   Q: Do you think Mr. Baker will have any more luck?
   A: I don't - I'm not sure he will. I'm not sure he will, but if
he can do what I've referred to in the beginning, if he can
convince Saddam Hussein of the truth, it'll be worth the effort
because, as I've said, it's not a negotiating session or - it's
certainly not a concession session. We're not going there to
concede one single inch because if you do that, and you want to put
it in theoretical terms, you have diminished instantly the new
peacekeeping function of the United Nations. And the coalition is
demoralized and falls apart, and that will not happen.
   So, what he's going to do is go there and make this very clear -
that there can be - there's no concession, that the world is united
and that this force, which is overwhelming, is there for a purpose.
And I would hope - I still hope - that gets the message through to
Saddam Hussein. Who had the last one? Somebody? Rita?
   Q: Thank you. Mr. President, as you mentioned on the civil
rights - or the minority scholarship issue - the possibility of
court challenges, what is your position on whether or not
scholarships should be earmarked for minorities in general? And
would you perceive some fine-tuning of the current new policies
which, I believe, now ban federal monies to be earmarked for
minorities, but not private funds?
   A: Well, as Mr. Williams pointed out, there's a legal question.
My own view has been all along - in my own life and everything else
- committed to this concept of minority scholarships. Clearly, it
should be valid privately and indeed, the support that we give to
the historically black colleges, that should - maybe someday will
get challenged. I hope it isn't and I hope it would sustain the
challenge.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... the challenge.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Clearly, the support that we give to these institutions
privately should be above - beyond challenge. But I don't know the
answer to your question as to how - you know - how that'll work out
in the courts. I don't know. We had a fascinating, almost
philosophical, discussion at lunch with some of the most prominent
black editors and publishers in this country. And I got into a very
lively discussion on this whole question of philosophy and what
happens to some kid from one minority group if the scholarships are
all allocated to one and not to another. And I don't know that
answer because I'm not a lawyer.
   What I do know is that I am for affirmative action and I am for
trying to help the groups that have been the most disadvantaged,
through scholarships. And that's what I think has been resolved in
the Department of Education at least in the foreseeable future, and
I hope it - I hope it stands. But, it's - I don't want to mislead
people in the country by suggesting that this may not receive a
challenge, and then the courts are going to have to make that
determination. And then, if somebody can legislatively correct it
fairly, why, I'd be open for that.
   But I don't want to buy into a - into a court solution question
that might happen way down the road. But I would recommend that
everybody take a look at the policy statement that just came out a
little bit earlier, and I think it will define where this stands
now and what - what the likelihood is of it's - and for how long it
will continue. Last one. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you said the Persian Gulf will not turn into
another Vietnam.
   A: Absolutely.
   Q: Could you give another - give us some projection of how long
you believe the conflict would last -
   A: No.
   Q:- as far as weeks, months -
   A: In the first place, I don't want to get - you guys want to
get me into talking about conflict all the time, and I - I
understand it, and as we go down towards the 15th, it'll probably
intensify. But, I want to still talk about hoping that we can get a
peaceful resolution to this question. But that means making Saddam
Hussein understand what's at stake.
   Secondly, I just simply cannot help you on the hypothesis. But
it - I can - I have looked into it enough and talked to enough of
the planners and those responsible, not only in our country, but
the leaders around the world to have - to be totally confident and
tell the American people, ``We are not looking at another
Vietnam.'' That the analogy is totally different in who's
supporting you, what the topography is, what the force is, what the
determination of the - of the military is - it's a whole array -
the coalition. All of these things come together and argue very
forcefully, this is not another Vietnam.
   And so, again, I get back to this very penetrating question by
the kid that wrote you - 18-year-old - because I can understand it.
I can tell where a guy like that's coming from. My own kids ask
that - a few grandchildren and stuff - What is this? What does it
mean? And so, it isn't. It is not going to be another Vietnam. And
you can get ranges from - all kinds of ranges in terms of how quick
this guy would fold. But none that I know of are predicting
anything like the long, drawn-out, bitter experience of Vietnam.
   Q: Are there going to be far less casualties, sir, in the
Persian Gulf than there were in Vietnam?
   A: Yes. But I can't document that. And you know, they asked the
question - some of you all weren't here for it - but in the
pressroom across the street, how many, and what's - how many can
you cope with? What's your - what's your - you know, how many is
enough, or how many is too much? One is too much, and so what do
you do?
   You plan that if you have to use force, to safeguard every
single precious human life, and that is exactly what our - Colin
Powell and his cohorts are doing over there. And that's what I owe
the parents and the kids and the spouses.
   And particularly I like to say that at this time of year, with
our holidays coming up and all of that. I mean, it's a very
emotional time for these families, and I have to understand it.
I've got to understand where this 18-year-old correspondent's
coming from and I've got to understand when I get these letters -
mostly supportive still, but some fraught with anxiety about their
own loved ones.
   And I can say to them: We - if force has to be used, we will
have done everything in our power to guarantee the life of every
single one of our soldiers, and so with sailors and marines and
airmen.
   And I will have that off my conscience, and then clearly it
won't work out in a sanitary fashion like that, but I would - I
never would want it said that we didn't go the extra mile. So I
took some hits on moving this additional force, and that's fine,
that goes with the territory. But at least I have the satisfaction
in my heart of hearing from our - Chairman of our Joint Chiefs and
our Commanding Gen. Norm Schwarzkopf, Hey, we're doing it right.
   You've seen these kids out here on Thanksgiving, and we owe it
to them to give them the best, give them the most, to get this job
done.'' And the Brits are looking at it that way, I think the
French are looking at it that way. The training that's going on and
has gone on with some of our other coalition partners are aimed to
that end, too.
   Listen, thank you all for coming and Merry Christmas to
everybody.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday that
Soviets should vote this winter on private land ownership and a
Union Treaty because the issues were too important to be decided
solely by lawmakers.
   But both plans already face opposition from leaders of some
republics.
   ``Such questions as the fate of a government,
self-determination, and the land on which you and your children
live - these are questions for the people,'' Gorbachev told
reporters and legislators on the second day of the 10-day Congress
of People's Deputies parliamentary session.
   President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation, the nation's
largest republic, said Russia will not agree to a land reform
referendum because its parliament already approved private
ownership of land.
   ``Russia took a decision, and that's it,'' Yeltsin said.
   Yeltin's opposition to the initiative was considered a major
blow to the Kremlin.
   Earlier Tuesday, officials from Estonia and Moldavia joined
those opposing the Union Treaty, which Gorbachev said is needed to
hold the nation together.
   ``We won't sign the Union Treaty. There is no chance of that
now,'' said Dimitru Matkovsky, a parliamentarian from Moldavia.
   He and about two dozen other Moldavian deputies stormed out of
the cavernous Congress hall because lawmakers had invited
representatives of two ethnic groups demanding autonomy within
Moldavia. Matkovsky said Moldavians would not participate until the
groups left.
   Meanwhile, news reports said that explosions rocked the Latvian
capital of Riga before dawn Tuesday. The blasts smashed windows in
the Latvian Communist Party building, the Soviet Army prosecutor's
office and the Latvian prime minister's office.
   No injuries were reported. Authorities said they had no suspects
or motives.
   The Russian Federation's Congress of People's Deputies voted
Dec. 3 to allow farmers to own land for the first time in 61 years.
That reversed a policy in effect since dictator Josef Stalin
carried out a bloody collectivization of land from 1929-32.
   Many economists agree with Russia's approach, arguing that
private ownership of land is indispensable to the creation of a
free market economy.
   Gorbachev has proposed that citizens of the 15 republics vote on
the issue and on the concept of a federated union.
   ``I introduced a suggestion to hold a referendum, and those who
don't want a union, let them go and secede,'' Gorbachev said.
   Calling secession ``a divorce process,'' he reiterated that any
separation by a republic must take place under Soviet law.
   ``If Estonia takes the position, `Yes, we'll leave the union, we
want to be like this,' then this divorce process will occur.''
   Gorbachev wants the Congress to endorse a treaty that would
redefine the relationship among the republics and the central
government.
   ``If it's a renovated federation ... no one would leave it, I
think, because it will mean cooperation, because in the entire
world it's just the opposite,'' the 59-year-old Soviet leader said.
   Russia, however, has continued to press ahead without waiting
for a new Union Treaty.
   On Tuesday, it signed its third bilateral trade and political
pact with another republic, Byelorussia. Russia has similar
agreements with the Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
   All the republics have declared some form of sovereignty since
last March. The declarations and subsequent anti-Kremlin laws have
paralyzed power in the country, worsening food shortages and
hastening economic collapse.
   The Union Treaty would preserve central control over national
security and such key industries as transportation and energy, and
natural wealth such as gold and diamonds. Most republics are
demanding that the national government also hand over the power to
make economic decisions.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel on Tuesday flatly rejected the
Union Treaty. Byelorussian Communist Party chief Anatoly Malofeyev
urged the deputies to support it as a way out of the political and
economic crisis.

<HEAD>Coalition to Fight Tougher Fuel-Economy Standards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of 53 business groups is girding
to battle tougher automobile fuel economy standards, fearful that
the proposal will gain momentum if war erupts in the Middle East,
spokesmen said Tuesday.
   The Coalition for Vehicle Choice was founded by the auto
industry, which this year led a successful fight against
legislation to require that new car fleets average about 40 miles
per gallon by the year 2001.
   But spokesmen said the coalition had a diverse membership - from
the American Farm Bureau Federation to the International
Professional Rodeo Association. Other members represent iron and
steel manufacturers, electrical contractors, police chiefs and
cattlemen.
   ``This debate has been perceived as between the auto industry
and the environmental movement,'' said Jeffrey B. Conley, executive
director of the coalition. The coalition will try to convince an
array of business and consumer groups that they have a stake in the
issue, he said.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., sponsored a bill that would require
new car fuel efficiency to improve 20 percent by 1995 and another
20 percent by 2001. The current minimum required efficiency is 27.5
mpg. The typical manufacturer's fleet of new cars would have to
average about 40 mpg within a decade.
   The bill, opposed by the Bush administration, died in the Senate
after supporters fell three votes short of the 60 needed to break a
filibuster.
   Bryan, who argued that his bill would reduce U.S. reliance on
Middle Eastern oil and reduce the air pollution that causes global
warming, will reintroduce the measure early nextyear, spokesman
Jim Mulhall said.
   ``The Persian Gulf situation has given the argument against
dependence on foreign oil an emotional element that didn't exist
prior to Aug. 2,'' when Iraq invaded Kuwait, Mulhall said.
   The coalition, Conley said, will sponsor briefings for
journalists, officials, and business and consumer organizations.
   The coalition will not lobby Congress, although individual
members will do so on their own, he said.
   The group's message will be that proposals such as Bryan's would
have a significant impact on Americans' lifestyles. Automakers say
they cannot meet his requirements without reducing car weight so
drastically that only the smallest vehicles can be sold, a
contention Bryan and environmentalists deny.

   Michael L. Williams' vigorous prosecutions of
Ku Klux Klansmen and other racial-terrorism cases during the 1980s
won him awards at the Justice Department.
   But his assertion last week that colleges receiving federal
funds can't legally reserve scholarships for minority students
found little favor with his bosses in the Bush administration, much
less the civil rights community.
   Williams, 37, an assistant secretary of education, softened his
position in accordance with White House wishes Tuesday and said
universities still could offer minority-only scholarships with
private money designated for that purpose.
   His policy declaration a week ago had startled some civil rights
leaders who had come from earlier meetings impressed by Williams
and his record. ``There was uniform disappointment at what happened
last week,'' said Ralph Neas, executive director of the 200-member
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Williams, 37, is a Midland, Texas native and childhood friend of
President Bush's son George. His parents and his wife, who is a
pilot and mechanical engineer, all attended historically black
colleges. While studying at the University of Southern California,
he challenged the school to admit more blacks by weighing
socio-economic factors as well as test scores.
   His resume is near-perfect. He's got three degrees from USC - a
law degree, a B.A. and a masters in public administration. He was
once a Big Brother; now he is a reading tutor at a local elementary
school.
   And as a Justice Department trial attorney from 1984 to 1988, he
prosecuted an array of high-profile cases: North Carolina Klansmen
who conspired to obtain stolen military weapons; an Idaho white
supremacist who tried to drive black and interracial families from
their homes; a Kentucky Klansman who firebombed the home of a black
family; and law enforcement officers in Alabama, Arizona, North
Carolina and Oklahoma who assaulted private citizens.
   ``He went after them with a vengeance and was very successful,''
said William Bradford Reynolds, who was assistant attorney general
for civil rights from 1981 to 1988. ``He was a very savvy lawyer, a
thoughtful, level-headed kind of guy who learned very quickly and
did exceptionally well.''
   Personally, Williams is described as having Texas charm and a
sense of humor worthy of Eddie Murphy. He wears lizard cowboy boots
and likes to collect things - including baseball caps and a plate
from each state in which he's had a trial.
   Politically, Williams served as a domestic policy adviser to the
Bush-Quayle campaign in 1988.
   Neas said the scholarship controversy fits into a Bush and
Reagan administration pattern of construing civil rights statutes
so narrowly ``that they in effect strangle the life out of them.''
   But Reynolds said Williams was simply ``going after
discrimination. ... He was concerned that scholarships exclusive to
one race are discriminatory. You can't really argue with that
proposition.''
   Williams owned up Tuesday to being politically naive, but not to
being wrong. ``I haven't been a lackey for anyone,'' he said. ``The
position I took was a position I took because I thought it was
right.''

<HEAD>Regulators Act to Avoid Taxpayer Bailout of Risky Thrift
Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank and thrift regulators, in separate
actions, took steps Tuesday aimed toward protecting taxpayers from
paying for financial institutions' risky investments.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates 2,389 savings
and loans, proposed a rule that would require the stockholders of
an institution gambling on interest-rate changes to put more of
their own capital behind the institution's investments.
   S&amp;Ls with more capital are better able to absorb losses and
avoid failure, thus avoiding a bailout paid for by the government's
deposit insurance program.
   Since November 1989, S&amp;Ls have been required to hold more
capital against loans and other investments with a higher risk of
default. And, a similar risk-based system takes effect for banks on
Jan. 1.
   However, Tuesday's proposal is the first by a financial
regulator to link capital levels to the danger posed by
interest-rate swings.
   Meanwhile, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
voted 5-0 on Tuesday to ask Congress for the power to tie deposit
insurance premiums to risk.
   Currently, all banks and S&amp;Ls pay the same premium, no matter
how risky their operations. Banks, starting Jan. 1, will pay 19.5
cents per $100 of deposits, up from 12 cents this year. S&amp;Ls have
and will be paying 23 cents.
   Critics contend this unfairly forces sound institutions to
subsidize high-fliers. Other kinds of insurance give breaks to
better customers. Safe drivers, for instance, pay less for auto
insurance and non-smokers pay less for life insurance.
   A study prepared by the FDIC for Congress recommends exploration
of two approaches for varying premiums. One would charge lower
premiums to banks and S&amp;Ls that hold a larger capital cushion. The
theory is that institutions willing to risk more of their owners'
money before failure should pay less for their insurance, much as a
homeowner willing to pay a larger deductible should pay less for
theft insurance.
   Another approach outlined by the study is having private
insurance firms set premiums based on the principal of market
competition. Under that concept, the FDIC would use government
funds to directly cover 90 percent of a bank's deposits. It would
purchase coverage from private firms for the remaining 10 percent
and set the premium paid by the bank according to the best rate it
could get from private firms.
   The Treasury Department, which has been working closely with the
FDIC, is likely to include one of the risk-based deposit insurance
schemes in a proposal it plans to release next month calling for
the most dramatic overhaul of the banking system since the
Depression.
   Small banks, represented by the Independent Bankers Association
of America, generally favor the insurance plan linked to capital,
since most small banks have a proportionately more capital than
large banks. The smaller banks fear that private insurance would
not be available to banks too small to be publicly rated.
   The thrift office's proposal on risk-based capital would force
banks to raise their capital by half of the amount it would lose in
the event of a 2 percentage point swing in interest rates. For
instance, an S&amp;L that would lose $10 million from such a swing
would have to hold $5 million more in capital than an S&amp;L not
subject to that risk.
   Fixed-rate loans and bonds held by S&amp;Ls generally lose value
when interest rates rise. At the same time, the institutions have
to pay more for their deposits.
   ``This is the latest in a series of steps taken ... to see that
thrifts safely manage their interest-rate risk,'' said thrift
office director Timothy Ryan.
   The agency noted that in the early 1980s, when interest rates
soared, most S&amp;L losses were caused by rising interest rates, not -
as is the case now - by defaulting loans.
   The agency is accepting written comments on the proposal for 60
days. It plans public hearings on Jan. 31 in Washington and Feb. 14
in San Francisco.

   Filling the new request by the Navy's Military Sealift Command

labor organizations to fill the positions.
   But it said that of the first 40 ships activated, only one
sailed without a full crew.

<HEAD>Cheney Threatens Stealth Contractors With Default</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department on Tuesday said it may
cancel as early as January its $4.8 billion contract for
development of a stealth warplane for the Navy.
   The department notified the developers, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and General Dynamics Corp., that they will be held in default of
the contract terms unless they present a new plan for resolving the
project's problems by Jan. 2.
   The announcement was the latest sign of serious trouble for the
Navy's proposed A-12 Avenger aircraft, a deep-strike bomber with
radar-evading capabilities. It is meant to be the service's main
carrier-based attack plane for the early 21st century. The Navy
plans to buy 620 of the planes for about $50 billion.
   The Pentagon's action also is a further blow for McDonnell
Douglas and General Dynamics. Published reports Tuesday said a
Pentagon audit of A-12 contract payments found that the government
had overpaid the companies by hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Los Angeles Times also
reported that a separate Pentagon audit concluded that the A-12
contractors have a ``possible chance of bankruptcy.''
   Al Spivak, a General Dynamics spokesman in Washington, said ``We
don't agree'' with the audits' findings. McDonnell Douglas also
contested the results.
   Spivak also took issue with the Pentagon declaration that the
A-12 contractors could be found in default.
   ``There is no way we can be considered in default of the
contract,'' Spivak said. ``In our view, the contract itself is the
major problem, and we hope that it will be restructured so that the
program can continue effectively.''
   McDonnell Douglas issued a statement in the name of its chairman
and chief executive officer, John F. McDonnell, which said: ``We
believe that we are not in default, and we are having discussions
with the Navy and Office of the Secretary of Defense to try to
assure the continuation of this vital national defense program on a
mutually satisfactory basis.''
   Just eight months ago, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney assured
Congress that the A-12 project was on schedule and within its
then-classified budget. A Pentagon Inspector General's report
released earlier this month said Cheney was not aware of the
project's serious problems because senior Navy and Pentagon
officials failed to pass on information that clearly showed the
contractors to be far behind schedule.
   Last Friday Cheney told Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett that
he would order a halt to the project unless Garrett could ``show
cause'' by Jan. 4 why it should proceed.
   In Tuesday's announcement, spokesman Pete Williams said the
Pentagon formally declared the performance of the two St.
Louis-based contractors to be unsatisfactory. That gives the
Pentagon the legal basis for declaring the contractors in default
in the event that their Jan. 2 proposals are judged inadequate.
   ``Everything about the A-12 is on hold,'' Williams told
reporters.
   The project is at least $1 billion over cost and at least 18
months behind schedule. Among the chief technical problems is
excess plane weight due to the thickness of the construction
material needed to make the plane strong enough for carrier
landings, according to a Navy report released earlier this month.
   Williams said he could not immediately explain the financial
consequences of a default declaration.
   Williams also disclosed that the Pentagon's No. 2 procurement
officer, Donald Yockey, and the Navy's assistant secretary for
procurement, Gerald Cann, met with unidentified representatives of
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics today.
   Williams said he could provide no information about the
discussions or the meeting's results. Spivak of General Dynamics
also declined to comment on the meeting.

<HEAD>Congressman Says There's New Evidence In Case Of Convicted War
Criminal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New evidence casts doubt on part of the case
against John Demjanjuk, the Ohio man convicted of running a Nazi
gas chamber as ``Ivan the Terrible'' and now appealing an Israeli
death sentence, the congressman who took up his cause said Tuesday.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said, ``They are holding the wrong
man.''
   Traficant said he believes he can prove Ivan Marczenko was the
real name of Ivan the Terrible and not an alias used by Demjanjuk,
as Israeli prosecutors claimed in court 2{ years ago.
   A newly discovered marriage certificate of Demjanjuk's parents
helps prove that Marczenko and Demjanjuk were different people by
refuting the prosecution contention that Demjanjuk took the alias
Marczenko because it was his mother's maiden name, the congressman
said.
   Demjanjuk, who was born in the Ukraine, had been unable to argue
that point in court because he did not remember his mother's birth
name, Traficant said. The certificate shows her name before
marriage was Iulianiya Tabachyk.
   The congressman said he wants to collect enough evidence to
force Israel's Supreme Court to discount the testimony of witnesses
who said Demjanjuk and Ivan the Terrible are the same man who ran a
gas chamber at the Treblinka death camp in Poland, where 850,000
Jews were slaughtered.
   Traficant said he hopes the court will consider statements from
Marczenko's former driver and a woman who told a BBC interviewer
she was compelled to have sex with Marczenko.
   Both have said Demjanjuk doesn't resemble Marczenko, according
to Traficant.

<TEXT>
   ``Awakenings'' is a ``feel good'' movie. It wants to make you
laugh. It wants to make you cry. It wants to make you feel good
about yourself, although nothing could match the self-satisfaction
of the filmmakers themselves.
   The movie is based on Dr. Oliver Sacks' book about
post-encephalitic syndrome, a neurological disorder that left
victims trancelike, virtually immobile for decades. The syndrome
was a result of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, or viral
sleeping sickness, that occurred from 1917-27.
   The illness was considered incurable until the late 1960s, when
a ``miracle'' drug, L-DOPA, was discovered. Sacks, working at Mount
Carmel Hospital in the New York City borough of the Bronx, tried
the drug on his patients in the summer of 1969.
   The results were, truly, a miracle. Within days many of them
were up and about, walking and talking, touching and smelling,
functions most people take for granted. Without condescension or
pity, Sacks wrote of their sheer awe and gratitude for having
another chance: ``There is nothing alive which is not individual:
Our health is ours; our diseases are ours; our reactions are ours.
... ''
   But the downside was just as strong. Some patients were
horrified to learn they had ``slept'' for so many years, gasping as
they looked in the mirror and saw their now-elderly faces. One
woman, who had been ill for more than 40 years, awoke believing it
was still 1926.
   Soon, side effects set in. Patients developed severe tics or
experienced drastic mood swings. Some regressed to their earlier
conditions and died. Others lived somewhat better than they had
before the emergence of the drug, but never as well as they had
that first summer.
   The cases of many of those patients are effectively re-enacted
in ``Awakenings,'' notably ``Leonard L'' as played by Robert De
Niro.
   Unfortunately, the simple truths about illness and aging are not
enough for director Penny Marshall (``Big'') and screenwriter Steve
Zaillian (``The Falcon and the Snowman'').
   They slap on a contrived love story and good vs. evil melodrama,
using stereotypes straight out of daytime soap operas: the kindly
doctor (Robin Williams), the lonely nurse (Julie Kavner) and the
unfeeling bureaucrat (John Heard).
   They recruit the world's nicest hospital staff and arouse
Leonard's interest with a girl sweet enough to live up to the name
of the actress who portrays her: Penelope Ann Miller. The story is
built for applause, such as when Heard insists there is no money
for the drug and quickly finds a check placed in front of him by
the ever-noble Kavner.
   ``Heartwarming'' may have worked for ``Big,'' but applied to
``Awakenings,'' it turns a dignified, moving story into a Jerry
Lewis telethon. Mercifully, it's much shorter.
   Produced by Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, with Marshall,
Arne Schmidt and Elliot Abbott as executive producers, the Columbia
Pictures release is rated PG-13. Running time: 120 minutes.
   ---&equals;
   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:

   Israel's plan to deport four more
Palestinians has pushed the United States into co-sponsoring a
Security Council resolution criticizing the Jewish state, diplomats
said Tuesday.
   Israel's action gives the United States a way out of a
diplomatic dilemma. For weeks, Washington has tried to avoid
vetoing another anti-Israel resolution, a move that could alienate
Arab allies arrayed against Iraq.
   That resolution contains an endorsement of an eventual Middle
East peace conference, which Washington fears could be seen as a
concession to Iraq.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says he will discuss Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait only in the context of a comprehensive
Middle East peace conference that would include discussing Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A U.S. draft resolution would lift the issue from the resolution
itself and relegate endorsement of a peace conference to a
separate, non-binding statement by the Security Council president.
   The statement would also say anew that the Persian Gulf crisis
and the Mideast peace conference are entirely separate issues and
must not be linked, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   It would have the council ``deplore'' Israel's resumption of
deportations of Palestinians as violating the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949 on the treatment of civilians under military
occupation.
   Israel, which signed the convention, holds the charter bans only
mass expulsions. The convention's exact words, however, are that
``individual or mass forcible transfers ... are prohibited.''
   For Palestinians, mindful that 700,000 of their people fled or
were driven from their homes when the state of Israel was created
in 1948, deportation is the worst punishment.
   The four men ordered deported are all from the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   On Tuesday, a military panel heard their appeal and the case
could go to the Supreme Court. But Israeli courts have never
overturned deportation orders. Israel has deported 60 residents of
the West Bank and Gaza during the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising.
It stopped the practice in August 1989, reportedly under U.S.
pressure.
   Israel and America are major allies and Israel is the largest
recipient of U.S. foreign aid.
   The resolution now favored by Washington would define parts of
Jerusalem as under military occupation, although Israel claims all
of Jerusalem as its capital after capturing Arab east Jerusalem
from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and subsequently annexing
it. Classifying east Jerusalem as ``occupied'' raises questions
about its status.
   Council president Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal of Yemen said the
council would meet again on the occupied territories issue on
Wednesday.
   He said he was not sure if it would take up the U.S.-favored
draft or the tougher draft sponsored by Cuba, Yemen, Colombia and
Malaysia.

<TEXT>
   A Northern California county Tuesday
became the first in the nation to approve a law banning unlicensed
pet breeding to reduce the number of unwanted animals killed each
week.
   San Mateo County supervisors approved the ban on a 3-1 vote
while a group of citizens protested outside with their dogs,
carrying signs that read: ``Sniff Out The Truth'' and ``Don't Hound
Responsible Dog Owners.''
   ``The intent was never to go after any group of people, but to
rectify an untenable situation in which we kill 10,000 pets a
year,'' Supervisor Tom Nolan said after the vote. ``We're entering
a new territory.''
   Nolan said he hoped the measure, which he wrote, would inspire
other jurisdictions to approve similar laws.
   The breeding ban was initiated by the Peninsula Humane Society,
which is forced to kill thousands of animals a year, officials
said.
   The ordinance will allow only dogs and cats owned by
professional and hobby breeders to reproduce. All other dogs and
cats in the county would have to be spayed or neutered. Violators
would be fined $500.
   ``The whole thing is going to end up an enormous legal battle,''
said Susan Clough of Redwood City, a show dog owner. ``We're not
causing the problem and this is not going to solve a single
thing.''
   Other protesters said the law should be aimed at cats.
   ``Seven thousand cats and so few dogs,'' Lois Frank said of the
death toll at the Humane Society. ``You are not getting to the
right people with your legislation.''
   The organization ran full-page ads in local newspapers showing
photos of drums packed with cat corpses.

<HEAD>Study Shows Cholesterol Damage Reversible in Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cholesterol-reducing drugs can help unclog
women's coronary arteries and reduce the risk of heart attacks,
just as the treatment does for men, a new study showed.
   The study is the first to document the reversal of
atherosclerosis in women through the use of the drugs, researchers
said.
   ``Critics have pointed out that no previous studies have
provided data on the response of atherosclerotic disease in women
to (blood-cholesterol) lowering therapy,'' study author Dr. John P.
Kane wrote in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Cholesterol kills by clogging the blood vessels that feed the
heart with lesions - a combination of cholesterol deposits and scar
tissue. Previous studies have shown that lowering blood cholesterol
levels can reduce coronary artery lesions in men.
   In their study over several years, authors looked at 41 women
and 31 men with atherosclerosis.
   Subjects took bile acid-binding resin and niacin daily, which
along with dietary changes reduced their blood-cholesterol levels
an average of 38.1 percent.
   After 26 months, coronary artery lesions shrank just more than 2
percent among the 22 women enrolled in the treatment. Lesions
diminished under the treatment program at about the same rate as
they originally developed.
   The 19 women in the control group, whose blood cholesterol
levels were reduced about 10.6 percent through diet changes and
less-intensive drug treatments, showed just more than a 1 percent
increase in coronary artery lesions, the study said.
   ``There are lots of other risk factors besides cholesterol. But
one of the most important risk factors is high cholesterol, and
reversal of atherosclerosis can reduce the chances of a heart
attack,'' said Dr. Mary Malloy, co-author of the study.
   The treatment's effect on men in the study showed the same
trends, but did not result in a statistically significant
difference among men, the study concluded.
   Kane is a professor of medicine and biochemistry at the
University of California at San Francisco.
   Earlier studies concentrated on men because coronary diseases
occur much more frequently in males between 40 and 60 years old
than in women, said Dr. David Blankenhorn of the University of
Southern California.
   Blankenhorn said doctors ``use the same medicines in women as in
men, but they're less likely to prescribe (cholesterol-reducing)
medicines in women, because the evidence wasn't in regarding what
would happen.''
   Women who haven't undergone menopause also get some protection
because the level of estrogen in their bodies slows the formation
of coronary artery lesions, Malloy said.
   Because of the effects of estrogen, researchers have been slow
to show that coronary artery lesions can be reduced in women, said
one critic, University of Wisconsin nutritionist Laura Vailas.
   ``We do know regression of atherosclerosis can be shown in men,
and I think we've been complacent in showing it in women. Women do
suffer risks just as men do,'' Ms. Vailas said.

   A fire that swept through a neighborhood of
three-family houses last week, displacing more than 100 people, was
arson, fire officials said Tuesday.
   ``The conclusion was based on witness statements, fire scene
examination and analysis of physical materials taken from the
scene,'' said Cpl. Dennis Galvin of the State Fire Marshal's
office.
   Chemical analysis was still under way to determine the exact
substance used to start the fire in a vacant building early Friday.
   The 10-alarm blaze was fanned by high wind that swept embers to
neighboring buildings and homes a block away. It destroyed or
damaged 11 buildings, burning 132 people out of their homes.
   Galvin said a $5,000 award had been posted for information
leading to an arrest in the case.
   ``Several leads are being followed. But the investigation is not
focused on any specific suspect at this time,'' Galvin said. ``We
are appealing to the public for assistance, and we would like to
see the same outpouring of support in catching the suspect that has
been shown in aiding the fire victims.''
   Donations for the fire victims have poured in from around New
England.

<HEAD>Mustang Ranch Brothel Prepares to Reopen for Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two months after the county vowed
that Nevada's most notorious legal bordello had seen its last
prostitute, and a month after it was sold at auction, the Mustang
Ranch prepared for business Tuesday.
   ``We reopened this morning,'' former owner Joe Conforte said.
``We could have opened the day the IRS left.''
   Conforte, who now is listed as general manager rather than owner
of the brothel 10 miles east of Reno, appeared before the Storey
County commissioners as a ``courtesy.''
   ``I didn't have to show up here at all,'' he said. ``I'm not
here to ask for a license. I'm here as a common courtesy to this
board to tell you how it is.''
   Conforte claimed that even though the Internal Revenue Service
padlocked the 104-room brothel in September and sold it two months
later to recoup some $13 million in taxes owed by him and his wife,
Sally, his license to operate the business remained in effect.
   Storey County Sheriff Bob Del Carlo said although prostitutes
began moving back into the brothel during the morning, no business
would transpire until health cards administered through his office
were issued.
   A few weeks after the IRS seizure, the county commission agreed
to cancel the special permit that allowed the Mustang Ranch to
operate as a brothel because of the circus atmosphere surrounding
it.
   But at least two commissioners earlier this month said they
would reconsider that action after county revenues lost the $60,000
annual license fee and the 2 percent tax from each of the Mustang's
occupied rooms.
   Conforte said he paid the county $16,500 for his quarterly
license fee two weeks ago, including a 10 percent late fee.
   While the commission debated whether it could accept Conforte's
quarterly payment for his licenses at the Mustang Bridge Ranch and
the adjoining Triangle River Ranch, both part of the Mustang Ranch
compound, Conforte sweetened his offer for them and a third, small
operation run by his nephew.
   ``We would like to make a proposal that the license fees for all
three places, whether they're open or not, be raised to $35,000 if
and when the dust settles. That would provide $105,000 to the
county.''
   The county commission took no action.
   Peter Perry, Conforte's lawyer, said because of building code
deficiencies, only the smaller Triangle River Ranch part of the
Mustang Ranch compound will resume operations.
   Perry happens to be listed with the Nevada secretary of state's
office as the sole officer of the ranch's new owner, Mustang
Properties Inc.
   The Mustang closed Sept. 18 when it entered Chapter 7
liquidation.
   Bankruptcy trustees spent three days trying to reopen the
bordello to sell it for the taxes owed by the Confortes, but the
IRS seized and padlocked the property Sept. 21.
   The brothel and its contents were sold at a tax auction in mid
November, with Victor Perry the successful bidder on the brothel
buildings and about 400 acres of land at $1.49 million on behalf of
Mustang Properties Inc., the company where his brother, Peter, is
the only listed officer.
   Although he appeared with Conforte at the commission meeting,
Peter Perry refused to answer questions about investors.
   Peter Perry was a member of a group of attorneys and investors
known as Mustang Ranch Inc., which relinquished its corporate
status after twice failing to buy the property through public stock
offerings of nearly $20 million, then $10 million.
   Peter Perry filed his incorporation papers the middle of August.

<HEAD>De Klerk Critical of Continued Pressure by Opposition Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an escalating war of words,
President F.W. de Klerk lashed out at the African National Congress
and other opposition groups Tuesday for fanning the ``flames of
confrontation.''
   The speech was likely to increase tensions between the
government and ANC, coming two days after the anti-apartheid group
closed a conference by endorsing the continuation of mass protests,
economic sanctions and other hard-line stances.
   It also threatened to break off talks with the government unless
it meets several key demands by April 30.
   De Klerk's televised Christmas message was moved up a week to
respond to the ANC, whose leaders include Nelson Mandela.
   ``The time has come for the ANC to decide what they want,'' de
Klerk said. ``Are they prepared (for) ... peaceful and negotiated
solutions, or do they want to revert to the confrontation and
conflict of the past?''
   The ANC had little response to the speech.
   Spokeswoman Gill Marcus said the group has ``taken note of the
points raised'' by de Klerk and would clarify its position on
various issues if the government so desired.
   At the conference, the ANC also demanded the return of exiles,
the release of political prisoners, an end of ``political'' trials
and the scrapping of security laws. De Klerk has agreed in
principle to most of the demands.
   De Klerk said his reforms have opened the door for grievances to
be discussed democratically, and there ``can no longer be any
excuse'' for political violence and intimidation.
   ``Some movements are still caught up in these undemocratic and
unacceptable strategies,'' he said.
   The ANC was the only group de Klerk mentioned by name. But he
clearly referred to the militant Pan Africanist Congress when he
said: ``Slogans such as `One settler, one bullet' ... are
absolutely unacceptable.''
   The slogan, referring to white descendants of the Dutch
settlers, is chanted at Pan Africanist rallies.
   De Klerk's harshest criticism was reserved for the ANC, which
has been holding talks with the government over the past year
intended to clear obstacles to full-scale negotiations on a new
constitution.
   ``It is disappointing that at its recent conference, the ANC
appeared to have reverted to outdated rhetoric and policies that
form the flames of confrontation,'' de Klerk said.
   ``They continued to talk of the transfer of power, while they
know that the purpose of the proposed negotiations is to determine
how ... power should be shared and domination avoided,'' he said.
   De Klerk has pledged to dismantle apartheid and give political
rights to blacks, who outnumber whites 30 million to 5 million in
South Africa. But he opposes a simple one-man, one-vote system,
saying it would replace white domination with black domination.
   The president said the ANC had ``refused to acknowledge that any
fundamental changes had taken place in South Africa - this despite
the fact that for the first time in 30 years they ... could hold a
conference ... within the republic.''
   Earlier Tuesday, de Klerk formally offered amnesty to thousands
of South Africans who left the country illegally when the ANC and
other opposition groups were banned.
   According to the offer, citizens who fled the country illegally
before Oct. 8 may return to the country without fear of
prosecution.
   The offer will clear the way for the return of most of the
20,000 ANC exiles.
   However, ANC members who took part in the group's bombing and
sabotage campaign and will have to request amnesty for violence and
other acts that could be prosecuted as crimes.
   Those cases will be judged individually, the Justice Department
said.
   The amnesty offer applies to exiles from other, smaller
opposition groups and people not associated with any particular
political movements.

   Clashes in the ethnically troubled Caucasus region
of the Soviet Union have killed six people since last week, the
Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
   The latest deaths occurred Monday night when two policemen were
killed and another was gravely wounded in an armed ambush in
Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan region, between the republic of Armenia
and the Iranian border.
   On Saturday, Armenian assailants fired on a motor vehicle en
route to Shushu, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh,
killing three Azerbaijanis, Tass said in a report from Baku,
capital of Azerbaijan.
   The sixth death occurred Dec. 13 when an Azerbaijani was killed
and two people were wounded after a truck convoy was ambushed en
route to the Azerbaijani village of Umudlu, Tass quoted Azerbaijani
KGB chief Vagif Guseinov as saying.
   He said extremists had tried to inflame tensions in
Nagorno-Karabakh by blocking access to the airport in its principal
city, Stepanakert, according to Tass.
   Similar attempts to heighten tensions often occurred before
important political events in the country, Tass quoted Guseinov as
saying, apparently referring to Monday's convening of the national
parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies.
   The past two years, more than 200 people have died in ethnic
clashes over control of Nagorno-Karabakh. The area is populated
mostly by Armenians but Azerbaijan has held it since 1923.

in various U.S. cities, the State Department said Tuesday.
   The arrest last week and the indictment Monday of Kenneth R.

   The department announcement alleged the Jamaican gangs

   It alleged that Weatherspoon conspired with the Jamaicans to
obtain U.S. passports for gang members. More than 35 fraudulent

   Weatherspoon has been a passport examiner since 1984. He faces a

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday defended
his need for more power to hold the Soviet Union together by saying
he could have been the strongest dictator in the world.
   In an emotional 45-minute chat with reporters in a Kremlin
lobby, Gorbachev also gave a rare glimpse of his inner thoughts
about the suffering endured by his father and grandfather.
   If the nation forgets its past, ``we should be swept away to
hell,'' he said during a break on the second day of the Congress of
People's Deputies parliamentary session.
   The Soviet leader spoke about the fragmentation of the Soviet
Union, saying national authority was being ``dragged apart piece by
piece by the republics and at local levels.''
   ``The chain is broken, electricity stops flowing down the wire .
.. and the executive power is stalled. Even if a decision is made,
it's killed.''
   That is why, Gorbachev said, he has raised the issue of greater
presidential power.
   ``It doesn't mean a return to dictatorship. Everyone knows that
I am not going to be a dictator,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``I could have become a dictator. The power of the general
secretary was such as no one else had in the world - none of the
Pinochets,'' he said, referring to Chile's former military leader,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and similar strongmen.
   He indicated that any decision to seize such absolute power
would not be an easy one for him.
   ``I made my choice. If a dictatorship were to come, the greatest
drama would be mine. I can't step on my own throat,'' Gorbachev
said.
   He said he was trying to ``unfold'' presidential power
gradually, ``so as not to destroy democracy itself.''
   Gorbachev said the country was on ``the brink of chaos.''
   ``If anyone thinks I cannot see this - I do see this.''
   Gorbachev later became emotional when talking about the need to
remember the suffering and hard work of past generations.
   In a new book about Gorbachev, author Gail Sheehy writes that
his paternal grandfather, Andrei, was sent to a labor camp during
the Stalinist terror of the 1930s. Gorbachev's father, Sergei, was
wounded on the Ukrainian front during World War II.
   Gorbachev recalled, ``The life of my family was full of
injustices. But when my grandfather returned after 1938-39, we once
sat an entire day and wept when he told us what they had done to
him. ... He worked for established collective farms, headed them.
   ``And can I go against it?
   ``And my father, he fought near Kursk on the Dnieper, and was
badly wounded. It undermined his health.
   ``Are we going to announce that we didn't live then?'' he said,
his voice rising with emotion. ``We should be swept away to hell if
we do!''
   Asked about the personal attacks against him by other political
leaders, Gorbachev said: ``I am not hurt by criticism.''
   ``But I must tell you that even I, a person who likes satire and
humor - it's my weakness - I can see how badly we lack cultured
criticism.
   ``Sometimes I am ashamed, but I always think, `Need I defend
myself?' Let society defend me. Society will eventually understand
that lack of respect to the president and authorities who were
elected democratically means disrespect to the people.''

<HEAD>Yugoslavia Moves to Bar Slovenian Vote on Independence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Yugoslav presidency on Tuesday
termed unacceptable Slovenian plans for a weekend referendum on
independence and instructed the federal government to take steps to
preserve national unity.
   The collective federal presidency did not specify the steps to
be taken.
   The presidency of Slovenia, the northernmost of this Balkan
country's six republics, denounced the statement and said the
federal presidency ``once again has shown that a democratic way of
resolving the Yugoslav crisis and relations among its peoples is
alien to it,'' Tanjug news agency reported.
   Slovenes will ``give an adequate reply to such a behavior and
pressures, at the plebiscite'' it said.
   The Dec. 23 referendum on full independence for Slovenia runs
counter to federal plans for this diverse country about 24.1
million people to settle its worsening political and ethnic
quarrels in a peaceful way, Tanjug said.
   The state presidency - a collective eight-member body, including
one representative from each of the six republics and two provinces
- serves as supreme commander of the armed forces.
   Defense Minister Gen. Veljko Kadijevic created a stir this month
when he suggested the army might intervene directly to preserve the
federation.
   Earlier Tuesday, the influential constitutional commission of
Yugoslavia's Parliament appealed for a peaceful, negotiated
solution to the power struggle between different republics.
   It said Parliament should meet Dec. 27 to discuss how the
country could stay united while the six republics work out
Yugoslavia's future. An agreement should be ratified by mid-1991,
after elections for a federal parliament, it said.
   Fear of an imminent breakup or of an armed struggle has grown
since Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and his former
Communists resoundingly won the first round of the republic's free
elections Dec. 9.
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency recently predicted
Yugoslavia may disintegrate within 18 months and civil war could
break out.
   The second round of elections Sunday in Serbia and pro-Communist
Montenegro coincides with Slovenia's scheduled vote on whether
Slovenia becomes fully independent.
   Croatia and Slovenia, where center-right parties ousted
Communists in spring elections, have threatened to secede. Serbia
and Montenegro favor a strong federal government.
   Slovenia's senior leaders on Tuesday told a news conference in
their capital of Ljubljana the plebiscite ``does not mean
secession,'' Tanjug said.
   It said President Milan Kucan, Prime Minister Lojze Peterle and
the chief of Parliament, Franc Bucar, assured reporters ``nothing
earth-shaking or undemocratic'' would happen after the referendum.
   Opinion polls have suggested Slovenians will vote overwhelmingly
for independence. But the plebiscite is seen as a last-ditch effort
to get other republics to agree to a new, loose confederation
rather than a step toward immediate secession.
   The presidency acknowledges that each republic has a
constitutional right to secede, but only after consultations with
the other five republics.
   It said that ``implementing the principle of self-determination
of the people'' without going by regulations set out by the
constitution and the law ``is unacceptable.''
   Slovenia's plans ``crudely reject and practically thwart the
initiative launched by the Presidency of Yugoslavia, to rearrange .
.. (Yugoslavia) ... in a peaceful, democratic, legal manner, based
on the constitution,'' it said.
   The presidency decides by majority vote and never announces
whether there are dissenting votes.
   The other two republics are Bosnia and Herezegovin,a and
Macedonia.

   NBC, aided by the season's best ratings for
its Tuesday night lineup, won the latest network battle for
television viewers.
   ``In The Heat of The Night,'' ``Matlock'' and ``Law &amp; Order''
each won their Tuesday time periods and landed in the top 20 for
the first time in the 13-week-old fall season.
   NBC earned a 12.4 average rating for the week, followed by ABC
with an 11.6 and CBS with 11.4, showed figures released Tuesday by

   Each ratings point represents 931,000 television homes.
   The top-rated network had seven of the top 10 shows, with
longtime favorite ``Cheers'' grabbing the most viewers of any
television program last week.
   A bag full of holiday specials failed to make the top 20. Even
NBC's ``Bob Hope's Christmas Special'' from Bermuda got left out in
the cold. The 60-minute Saturday night special ranked 22nd. A
repeat and colorized version of the CBS ``I Love Lucy Christmas''
tied for 30th place with ABC's ``Sunday Night Movie: The Witches of
Eastwick.''
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the No. 2 show, followed by a two-way
tie for third place between NBC's ``A Different World'' and ABC's
NFL ``Monday Night Football'' match-up between the Los Angeles
Raiders and the Detroit Lions.
   ``Empty Nest'' on NBC was fifth. NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
``In The Heat of The Night,'' spun from the Oscar-winning 1967 film
of the same name, tied for sixth.
   A repeat featuring the wisecracking mom of ABC's ``Roseanne''
was No. 8. ``The Golden Girls'' on NBC was No. 9, followed by the

   The Interstate Commerce Commission voted
unanimously Tuesday to ban smoking on all regularly scheduled
interstate buses in the United States.
   Bus companies were given the option of allowing charter
passengers to smoke if the chartering group agrees it should be
permitted.
   The ban will take effect soon after the issuance of the
commission's decision in writing and its publication in the Federal
Register, according to ICC spokesman A. Dennis Watson.
   Lawyers for the ICC said the change was supported by a wide
variety of groups but was opposed by the tobacco industry.
   John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and
Health, the organization whose request initiated the ICC action,
praised the decision.
   ``Smokers can refrain from smoking for several hours and light
up at bus stops, but non-smokers cannot similarly refrain from
breathing,'' Banzhaf said.
   The ICC lawyers contended that smoking has been proved to be
injurious to health and that tobacco smoke cannot be adequately
ventilated from buses to assure the health and comfort of
non-smokers.
   The commission began its consideration of a smoking ban last
March at the request of the American Bus Association and United Bus
Owners of America, the national trade associations for the
intercity bus business.
   In April, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), an anti-smoking
association, filed a similar request but asked that it be imposed
on all buses, including charters.
   Officials for the bus industry contended that operators of
charter buses should be permitted to regulate smoking based on
their passengers' desires.
   The commission lawyers said officials of the nation's charter
bus industry said they feared some business would be lost i they
were compelled to enforce a uniform non-smoking ban.
   The ICC no-smoking rule affects passengers served by about 300
bus companies that provide service on interstate routes. In 1990,
these companies are expected to serve some 24 million passengers.
   Greyhound, the nation's largest bus company, banned smoking on
its own initiative shortly after the ICC began considering the
issue.
   As the regulatory process unfolded this year, ASH contended that
bus passengers are entitled to the same protection from tobacco
smoke in the air as those who travel by plane and train.
   It noted that Amtrak recently banned smoking in the last four
rows of its Superliner lounge cars and in most of its train
stations. There are still smoking cars on trains.
   Smoking is banned on almost all domestic airline flights. The
only exceptions are flights to Alaska and Hawaii, each lasting more
than six hours. Overseas flights are not affected.
   ASH said that a recent study of air quality in airline passenger
cabins showed that as many as 440 non-smokers a year would die of
cancer if smokers were to continue to light up aboard flights
lasting two hours or longer.
   The anti-smoking group said bus passengers would be at even
higher risk if smoking were to continue.
   It said the smaller seating capacity of buses forces non-smoking
passengers to be seated closer to smokers than on planes. It also
said ventilation on buses often is inferior to that on airplanes.
And it said buses are often the only affordable means of
long-distance transportation for the poor and elderly.
   The bus trade associations also cited the health issue, but they
contended a clear federal prohibition would also eliminate any
misunderstanding in the effort of individual bus companies to
enforce limitations on smoking.
   They said the current rule limiting smoking to no more than 30
percent of bus seats is hard to enforce and that efforts by some
companies to ban smoking could place them at a disadvantage if
competitors advertised that smoking was permitted.
   The tobacco industry contended that health hazards posed to
non-smokers on interstate buses are not proved.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Czechoslovak Embassy in
Washington will stop representing Cuban diplomatic interests in the
United States by March, the state CTK news agency reported Tuesday.
   CTK quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the grace period
should permit Havana ``to cope with the new situation, without
jeopardizing its interests in the U.S.A.''
   The Czechoslovak Embassy has represented Cuban interests in
Washington since 1977. Diplomatic and consular ties between Cuba
and the United States were severed in January 1961.
   Interests sections enable countries to maintain diplomatic
contact without having to have full-fledged embassies.
   A senior Cuban diplomatic official in Washington, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said the Cuban government has no
alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current
arrangement with the Czechoslovak government.
   He said he assumes both the Cuban and U.S. governments wish to
maintain a diplomatic presence in each other's capital and that
Cuba will seek a new arrangement.
   The official said he had seen news reports about Prague's
decision but had heard nothing officially.
   U.S. diplomatic activities in Havana have been carried out under
the auspices of the Swiss embassy. One diplomatic source suggested
that Cuba may ask the Swiss to perform that function for Cuba in
Washington.
   The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry source
as saying that ``the different opinions of the two countries on the
exercising of human rights'' and other fundamental differences
prompted the Czechoslovak decision.
   Czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution
that toppled the Communist leadership one year ago; Cuba remains
Communist-ruled.
   The ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after
Czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to Prague's decision,
CTK said.
   He singled out the storming of Czechoslovak embassy premises in
Havana in July by Cubans who claimed they were dissidents but who
the Czechoslovaks believe were in the pay of the Cuban government.
   The invasion of the embassy ``can be rightfully presumed to have
been intended to discredit the new Czechoslovak regime in the eyes
of the Cuban public,'' CTK quoted the source as saying.
   Efforts to contact the Czechoslovak embassy in Washington by
telephone were unavailing.

   Researchers who studied disasters and terrorist
crimes said Tuesday that rescue workers can be as emotionally
affected as survivors and relatives, and need careful counseling.
   Police officers, ambulance workers and firefighters have quit
their jobs because nobody talked to them about the mental strain,
speakers told 700 delegates at a London conference of the British
Psychological Society.
   Margaret Mitchell, psychology lecturer at Glasgow University,
said, ``We need to learn how rescuers can finally put these
traumatic experiences behind them and continue to operate
effectively in their jobs.''
   Britain suffered a dozen disasters that claimed 1,000 lives
within four years in the 1980s - including 150 deaths in two soccer
stadiums, 188 on a capsized English Channel ferry, and 167 in a
North Sea oil platform explosion.
   Some rescuers involved also went abroad to help after
earthquakes in Armenia, Iran and the Philippines.
   On Tuesday, four London firemen who fought the 1987 King's Cross
subway station fire in which 31 people died were awarded a total of
$66,000 in damages for injuries that were almost exclusively
psychological.
   The claim was settled out of court and the men became the first
members of the emergency services to receive compensation for such
injuries.
   The psychologists' meeting was held three days before the second
anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed all
259 people on the airliner and 11 others on the ground in
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   ``Mre than 2,000 police from Strathclyde (Scottish region) were
sent to Lockerbie, so that only limited psychological debriefing
could be carried out,'' said Ms. Mitchell, who studied police
officers working in the Lockerbie morgue.
   ``Many of them still think about what they saw and some of them
say they could have got over the stress if there had been
structured debriefing after each day's work. But that wasn't
possible.
   ``There is often a feeling of alienation among the rescue
services who have seen things that others cannot imagine.''
   Dr. David Duckworth, a Leeds University consultant psychologist
to three police forces, said he knew of officers so affected by
horrors they saw that they were physically sick in the mornings
before going to work.
   ``The effects of disaster on rescue workers can be as traumatic
as shell shock and combat fatigue in warfare and as long lasting,''
said Dr. James Thompson, a psychologist at London's Middlesex
Hospital who also runs a stress clinic helping disaster survivors.
   ``In every disaster, some people involved are mentally disabled
because they are carrying such a burden,'' Thompson told a news
conference.
   ``All the evidence we have suggests it is helpful if those
working on a disaster are encouraged to talk about their reactions
and decisions with psychologists and social workers, even within
the team with someone who has done it before.''
   Thompson added, ``We find some people are not helped by
counseling. That's a challenge for which we are still trying to
find the real factors and the real therapy.''
   He said authorities should tell relatives whatever they wanted
to know even if the details were very painful, and they should have
a legal right to information.
   ``They should be told everything - it would help them get over
the shock,'' he said.
   Iris Suzuki, a medical student who studied stress among 40
London ambulance workers, said, ``The public expects ambulance
crews to be superhuman and act like it, but deep down they react
like any other human beings.''
   Dr. Jim Swire, a country doctor whose daughter Flora was killed
on Pan Am Flight 103, said a deliberate effort was made to stop
relatives from finding out what had happened.
   ``There were official moves to ensure that available information
should not go to the relatives and it took a lot of pushing and
shoving to change it,'' he said.
   Swire is campaigning for Flight 103 families to be told
everything about the bombing.
   He expressed disappointment that the Home Office, which runs the
police, has not set up professional and coordinated support groups
to help relatives in future disasters.
   ``Some people believe the right thing to do is to hide things
from relatives but nothing can happen to a relative to compare with
the disaster. It is beneficial to relatives to talk about it,''
Swire said.

   A 35-year-old Italian merchant was
released Tuesday by his kidnappers in the Apromonte Mountains after
eight months in captivity, police said.
   ``It's over, it's over,'' Rocco Surace said when a police patrol
found him wandering in the woods near this city in the Calabria
region of southern Italy.
   Looking haggard with a long beard, Surace was taken to the
police station in Gioia Tauro where doctors pronounced him in
relatively good condition.
   Police said they had been searching for Surace in the area in
recent days and speculated the kidnappers might have released him
because they feared being captured.
   It was not immediately known whether any ransom had been paid.
Surace, whose family runs a clothing business, was kidnapped April
12 near his home in Rizziconi.
   His release leaves six other Italians in the hands of
kidnappers. Longest held is Andrea Cortellezzi, abducted in Varese
in Febuary 1989.

   Elvis Presley's acoustic guitar sold for $24,200
and Jimi Hendrix's handwritten lyrics for the rock anthem ``Purple
Haze'' brought $17,600 at an auction, Sotheby's said Tuesday.
   The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland placed the winning
bid for the lyrics, the auction house said.
   The 1966 draft in black ball-point pen on yellow-lined notepaper
is the earliest known to exist of ``Purple Haze,'' which appeared
on Hendrix's debut album ``Are You Experienced'' in 1967. The
lyrics were valued at $8,000 to $12,000.
   Only four of 60 Hendrix lots failed to sell at Monday's sale.
The collection of handwritten lyrics, essays, song notes and
personal belongings was consigned by an anonymous collector, said
Laura Stewart, a Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   The Hendrix collection brought $176,000. The total for the sale
of entertainment and rock 'n' roll memorabiia was $293,269, the
auction house said.
   An anonymous buyer placed the winning bid for the Presley
guitar, which was estimated to sell for $15,000 to $20,000. The
custom-made guitar from the 1970s was finished in black with
``Elvis Presley'' inscribed in a mother-of-pearl inlay across the
fretboard.
   The guitar was sold by an anonymous consignor, Stewart said.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer picked to help form a new
government announced Tuesday he quit because of ``significant
differences'' with President-elect Lech Walesa over major
appointments.
   Jan Olszewski, 60, who was favored to become prime minister,
said his two weeks of talks settled ``the main principles of the
program and tentative decisions on the future composition of the
government.''
   ``Because there were significant differences in opinion between
the president-elect and myself on the composition of the government
... I resigned from the mission,'' he said in a statement read on
the evening television news.
   Walesa spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski denied the resignation posed
any problem in naming the next government and said Walesa will
announce his choices for main government posts by Saturday.
   Olszewski said Walesa chose him on Dec. 2 to hold the talks on
forming a government. Walesa scored an overwhelming victory in a
presidential runoff Dec. 9 and is to be sworn in Saturday.
   A source close to Olszewski, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the disagreement was over the role of Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz in a new government. The source said
she could give no details.
   Balcerowicz, architect of Poland's tough economic reform
program, is considered essential to persuade Western creditors that
Poland is sticking to its program to switch to a market economy.
   But published reports say he demanded complete independence in
running the economic program.
   The state PAP news agency quoted Zdzislaw Najder, chairman of
the national Solidarity Citizens Committee and a longtime friend of
Olszewski, as saying Olszewski's attempt to form a government
turned into a ``fiasco.''
   Drzycimski said in a telephone interview that Walesa is
considering at least three alternatives to Olszewski for prime
minister.
   He said Walesa has made up his mind about most of the positions
in the government, and will stress concern for the economy and
young people.
   Walesa cannot officially nominate a prime minister before he is
sworn in. In the meantime, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and
his Cabinet stay on in caretaker roles following their resignations
last week.
   Poland's government-in-exile on Tuesday agreed to hand over its
historic symbols of authority to Walesa, the nation's first
popularly elected leader.
   The London-based government-in-exile never recognized Poland's
45 years of Communist rule. It goes back to the leaders who fled
Poland in 1939 ahead of the invading Nazi German army.

<HEAD>Not Many Drug Users In Aviation, FAA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than one-half percent of more than
120,000 recent drug tests in the aviation industry showed the
presence of drugs, the Federal Aviation Administration said
Tuesday.
   The tests were conducted among commercial aviation employees
ranging from pilots to airport security screening personnel as well
as people applying for such safety or security sensitive jobs, the
FAA said.
   An analysis of the 120,642 tests showed drugs in 561, just 0.47
percent of the total, the FAA said. Of the 51, 345 were in
pre-employment tests, and those people were not hired for sensitive
jobs.
   Persons already employed who tested positive were removed from
sensitive positions, the agency said.
   ``These statistics indicated that drug use in aviation is not
widespread, but even one drug user is too many and will not be
tolerated,'' said James B. Busey, the FAA administrator.
   Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
the trade association for commercial U.S. airlines, said the
industry was pleased by what he called ``these exceptional
results.''
   ``While employee drug use remains a concern of the airlines,
these results show we have an effective program for screening out
drug users before they enter the industry and turning up users
already employed,'' Aaronson said.
   ``The results also indicate that the major airlines have far,
far less of a drug problem than our society at large, where one in
10 people use illegal drugs, according to government estimates,''
he said.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said
the analysis bore out ``what we have been saying all along, that
they were not going to find any significant amount of drug abuse by
airline pilots.''
   ``We would hope that the government and industry would refocus
their efforts away from heavy-handed methods,'' Mazor said.
   Aaronson said that 90 percent of employees testing positive have
resigned with those remaining entering rehabilitation programs.
   The drug tests were conducted between January and the end of
June.
   They were required under a new Department of Transportation
anti-drug program initiated last year.
   Under the program, 3.2 million other transportation workers also
will be subjected to drug testing. They include interstate truck
and bus drivers, railroad workers, sailors on commercial vessels
and pipeline workers.
   Some 538,000 aviation industry employees are subject to drug
testing - before employment, at random or periodically on the job,
after accidents and whenever there is reasonable cause to suspect
drug abuse.
   Included are pilots, mechanics, flight attendants, airport
security screening personnel and aircraft dispatchers.
   A breakdown of the test results that showed drug use among both
applicants and employees revealed 18 pilots or other flight crew
members, 116 flight attendants, 300 maintenance personnel, 48
aircraft dispatchers, 41 security personnel, five flight
instructors, and four private air traffic control personnel.
Twenty-nine persons were not identified by job function.
   Of the positive tests, 346 were attributed to marijuana use, 196
to cocaine, 13 to opiates, one to the use of PCP, and 15 to
amphetamine use. Those numbers add to more than 561 because of
multiple drug use by some people tested.

   The youngest of three brothers who
allegedly help run the Medellin cocaine cartel surrendered Tuesday
under a govenment offer not to extradite drug trafficking
suspects, officials said.
   Fabio Ochoa Vasquez became the first cartel leader to turn
himself in under the 3{-month-old offer, which also promises
reduced jail sentences for drug suspects who surrender and confess.
   The U.S. extradition request for Ochoa alleges he led the
cartel's cocaine distribution center in Miami. He is also accused
of participating in the 1986 murder of Adler ``Barry'' Seal, a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration informant whose testimony helped
indict several leading traffickers.
   ``The government is very satisfied that decree 2047 is having
all the effects it should have in Colombian life,'' President Cesar
Gaviria said, speaking over the Caracol radio network, after the
surrender was announced.
   Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo confirmed the surrender and said,
``We hope that they all turn themselves in.''
   In the past month, four mid-level drug traffickers surrendered.
   Ochoa left a communique with family members explaining his
decision.
   ``I hope this contributes in the best way to peace and
understanding in Colombia,'' Ochoa said in the statement read over
local radio.
   A communique from the Ochoa family said the drug lord
surrendered to a court official at a church 12 miles south of
Medellin, Colombia's second largest city and home base to the
world's most violent cocaine cartel.
   Ochoa will have to confess at least one of his crimes if he is
to avoid extradition.
   Further legal guarantees were offered in another presidential
decree Monday, including human rights safeguards for surrendering
traffickers.
   Ochoa, 33, has been named in three federal indictments in the
United States, and was cited by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh as
one of the ``Dozen Most Wanted'' Colombia drug defendants in August
1989.
   He allegedly helped run the cartel with his brothers Jorge Luis
and Juan David.
   ``My brother decided to turn himself in to Colombian justice
because he believes in it,'' said Marta Nieves, Ochoa's sister,
speaking on the RCN radio station.
   She added that the family plans to release a videotape of Ochoa
surrendering in Caldas.
   Jaime Cordoba, human rights director at the attorney general's
office, said that rights delegates will be appointed to oversee
Ochoa's case.
   Radio reports said Ochoa was taken to a maximum-security prison
near Medellin.
   In late November, the Medellin drug bosses said as many as 300
traffickers were willing to surrender in return for government
guarantees they will not be extradited to the United States and not
be treated as common criminals.
   Ochoa was named in a 1986 federal indictment in Baton Rouge,
La., linking him to the slaying of Seal. The same year, he was
indicted on drug trafficking-related charges in Miami.
   In 1989, he was also named along with his brother Jorge Luis
Ochoa and cartel leaders Pablo Escobar and the late Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha in an 11-count indictment in Jacksonville, Fla.,
that grew out of the successful drug trafficking prosecution of
Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   Escobar, reputedly the cartel chief, remains at large. It was
not clear if Ochoa's brothers were also preparing to surrender.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for killing 550 Colombians
since the government and traffickers declared war on each other 16
months ago.
   Thousands of others have been killed in gang violence and
score-settling in the drug trade.
   The cartel has released four of nine journalists it kidnapped
recently.
   The cartel said earlier the kidnappings were a response to
rights abuses by police in Medellin. They were also apparently
trying to pressure the Gaviria administration to gant pardons.

   AT&amp;T Corp. plans to reduce weekday
long-distance rates starting Jan. 1, the long-distance company said
Tuesday.
   The reduction, about $33 million in annual revenue to the
company, reflects lower fees that will be paid to local telephone
companies for access to customers' telephonen lines, AT&amp;T said.
   Basic customer-dialed long-distance calls by individuals and

   An 8-year-old boy separated from his
classmates because he wears a ponytail will continue his studies in
isolation and keep up his legal battle with school officials, his
mother said Tuesday.
   Officials say Zachariah Toungate's 7-inch ponytail violates his
school's dress code, but he and his parents claim the code
discriminates against boys because girls are allowed to wear long
hair.
   State District Judge H.R. Towslee denied a temporary order to
put Zach back into class last month. Tuesday, the judge gave the
family's attorney until Jan. 10 to file expanded arguments telling
how Zach's isolation has harmed his mother, September Toungate.
   Attorney Charles Beall said he will appeal Towslee's denial of
the temporary order.
   Zach, a third-grader, has been taught in an 11-by-13-foot room
for the past 2{ months. Mrs. Toungate said after the hearing her
son is frustrated in the room, but wants to keep his ponytail and
continue the battle.
   ``He's hanging in there,'' she said.
   School Superintendent Paul Flemming said the issue is whether
students must obey the rules.
   ``The question is not a kid with a ponytail,'' Flemming said.
``The question is can a school district allow a student to
willfully and continuously disobey rules.''
   Zach has received letters from people who support him, Mrs.
Toungate said.
   ``We are overwhelmed from the response from around the world.
From the Persian Gulf to Canada to Germany, it's truly amazing,''
she said.
   Flemming said he was amazed too.
   ``I think it's amazing that this much attention has been paid by
the media to what is basically a violation of a simple dress
code,'' he said.
   Bastrop, a town of about 3,700 people, is about 30 miles east of
Austin.

<HEAD>Forecasters: Recession Likely Through First Half of 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economic recession probably began in
August and will continue through the first half of 1991, a group of
California forecasters said Tuesday.
   How much the economy shrinks, and for how long, will be
determined more by banks and the Federal Reserve Board than by
Saddam Hussein, said economists at the UCLA Business Forecasting
Project's year-end conference.
   Lenders' cautiousness could keep a lid on real estate and other
industries despite actions such as the Fed's lowering of the key
discount rate to 6.5 percent Tuesday, said David G. Hensley, the
acting director of the forecast.
   ``Even if the Fed does bring rates down, financial institutions
might be so risk-averse that they will not lend money,'' rendering
Fed policy ineffective, Hensley said.
   ``Construction is an important avenue of recovery from
recessions, and a shutoff of real estate lending would likely
inhibit the vigor of the recovery,'' he said.
   The economists said current economic indicators point to a short
downturn. They estimated the core annual inflation rate at just 3.6
percent in September and October, and said manufacturers'
inventories have been well-managed.
   Consumption spending and business fixed investment were strong
in the third quarter of 1990 despite a plunge in consumer
confidence, they said.
   The UCLA forecast, generally well-regarded, is also known as one
of the gloomiest put out by California's economic forecasters.
   It said California's economy is in recession along with the
nation's, dragged down by aerospace industry trauma and the stalled
housing industry.
   ``The bleak evidence on employment, housing, help-wanted
advertising and retail sales - reflected in budget problems
throughout the state - strongly suggests that California will
participate fully in the national downturn,'' Hensley said.
   The forecast said the gross national product was expected to
decline by 0.9 percent in 1991, with a sharp downturn in the first
half followed by recovery later.
   UCLA forecasters currently assume that a diplomatic solution
will be reached to the confrontation in the Persian Gulf over
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Even if war comes, they feel it
will have less effect on the economy than might be expected.
   ``Some economists have argued that war would provide a huge
boost to the economy,'' Hensley said. ``But - considering that any
conflict would follow the biggest military buildup in U.S.
peacetime history - the near term stimulus is likely to be
marginal.''
   He said a temporary spike in oil prices resulting from a
shooting war would offset any possible uplifting effects on the
economy.

   The Soviets have apologized to South
Korea for the Korean War and for downing a Korean airliner in 1983,
the national news agency reported Tuesday, quoting Korea's foreign
minister.
   The Soviet Union supported Communist North Korea against the
South during the 1950-53 Korean War. In 1983, the Soviets shot down
a KAL airliner when it strayed into Soviet air space, killing all
269 people aboard.
   The Yonhap news agency said Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong told
a parliamentary committee of the apologies during testimony Tuesday
about his talks last week with the Soviet foreign minister.
   ``It is true that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
conveyed an official apology,'' Choi was quoted as saying.
   Choi accompanied President Roh Tae-woo to Moscow last week for
summit talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The two nations normalized relations Sept. 30.
   On Saturday, Roh told reporters in Moscow that he and Gorbachev
discussed the downing of the jetliner and the end of the Cold War
in the Pacific.
   ``We promised each other that everything that happened in the
past should be a thing of the past, and we should start a new
chapter in the history of our bilateral talks,'' Roh said.
   Choi told the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and
Unification Committee that Shevardnadze expressed regret for the
``unfortunate incidents.''
   In response to a question from a lawmaker, Choi said the
expression of regret was an official apology.
   ``President Roh's visit was not aimed at hearing a Soviet
apology for the unfortunate incidents,'' Choi was quoted as sayng.
   ``But when I told reporters after my meeting with Shevardnadze
that the Soviet minister had conveyed an official apology to our
government, the Soviets neither raised issue with it nor
objected.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Supporters of the former Duvalier
dictatorship said Tuesday they would fight to overturn the expected
presidency of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide using legal means.
   ``We'll decide after the results are in how we are going to act,
but it won't be in a violent way,'' said Serge Conille, executive
secretary of the Union for National Conciliation, the Duvalier
political party.
   Two days after Haiti's first democratic elections, the
independent Electoral Council had released only a fraction of the
vote because of difficulties communicating with remote areas.
   International observers said, however, that Aristide was a clear
winner, and a council source said on condition of anonymity that he
agreed.
   Under Haitian law, the Electoral Council has 10 days from the
election to publish the results. It was expected to complete the
count by the week's end.
   Aristide, 37, a leftist priest and champion of the poor, has
made no public appearances since Sunday's election. Electoral law
prohibits candidates from declaring victory on the basis of
projections.
   With 194,820 votes - or about 10 percent - counted, Aristide had
127,099 votes, or 65.2 percent. Former World Bank official Marc
Bazin had 22,320, or 11.5 percent; agronomist Louis Dejoie Jr.,
21,437, or 11 percent; and evangelical preacher Sylvio Claude,
6,044, or 3.1 percent. Seven other candidates also were in the
race.
   Dejoie conceded defeat. Bazin made no statement, but his
sister-in-law, Danielle Bazin, a party official, said: ``We are
very disappointed, but we are democrats. If that's what the people
want, it's OK.''
   After a day of huge victory celebrations, the capital of
Port-au-Prince returned to normal Tuesday with streets and markets
crowded as usual.
   The celebrations came to an abrupt end Monday when a pregnant
woman was killed at a rally outside Aristide's former church in the
slum of La Saline. Radio reports said the woman was shot by police
who pulled up in a pickup truck and opened fire on the crowd.
   The army, however, said the woman had been run over by a
vehicle. Police had intervened in the area and fired into the air
to disperse demonstrators who were about to attack an unidentified
person, an army statement said.
   An autopsy was scheduled on the dead woman, said to have been
seven months' pregnant.
   The woman's death heightened fears that right-wing supporters of
the 29-year dictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his
son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc,'' would instigate violence to prevent
Aristide from taking office.
   But Conille said the Duvalierists would use only legal means to
overturn the election, which international observers said was free
and fair. He did not elaborate.
   Conille is the right-hand man of Roger Lafontant, the
self-proclaimed former leader of the hated Tonton Macoute militia
that enforced the Duvalier rule.
   Lafontant returned last summer from five years' exile in
neighboring Dominican Republic to run for president. The Electoral
Council, however, disqualified him on technical grounds, including
his alleged failure to produce a birth certificate and because he
had not been cleared of financial wrongdoing when formerly in
office as interior minister.
   Lafontant is fighting the ruling in the courts.
   Former President Leslie Manigat, who won army-controlled
elections in January 1988 and was deposed by a military coup five
months later, has brought a similar case in the Supreme Court. He
was barred on grounds that the constitution prevents any president
from serving two consecutive terms.
   The Duvalier dictatorship ended on Feb. 7, 1986, when the
younger Duvalier fled into exile in France after a popular
uprising. Since then, Haiti has been ruled by five governments,
four controlled by the army.
   The new administration is to replace the interim civilian
government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court
judge appointed in March to lead Haiti to its first fully
democratic elections.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Attorney General Faults Police Actions in Stuart
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston police violated individual civil rights in
using stop-and-search tactics and appeared to have coerced
witnesses to testify in the Stuart murder case, the Massachusetts
Attorney General said Tuesday.
   In a report based on a nearly yearlong investigation, James
Shannon said he found a broad pattern of civil rights infringements
in search tactics, in which police randomly stopped and frisked
minority youths in Boston's inner city.
   Police Commissioner Francis Roache called Shannon's allegations
``totally unjustified and completely lacking in due process.''
   The murder of seven-months-pregnant Carol Stuart, who was white,
in October 1989 generated widespread publicity. Her husband,
Charles, who was seriously wounded, told police a black mugger
abducted them in their car and shot them.
   William Bennett, a black man whom police were investigating in
connection with the shooting, was absolved when Charles Stuart
jumped to his death off a bridge and police implicated him in his
wife's slaying.
   Shannon, who leaves office Jan. 3, stopped short of bringing
court action, saying such a move would prove time-consuming and
ineffective. Instead, he recommended that a civilian review board
be established to monitor police.
   Before the Stuart slaying, black community leaders complained
that police wrongly stopped and searched black youths. The outcry
intensified when police, seeking a suspect in the Stuart case,
kicked down doors and strip-searched young black men.
   ``There is no excuse for forcing young men to lower their
trousers, or for a police officer to search inside their underwear
on public streets and hallways,'' Shannon said in the report.
``That practice must be condemned in the strongest possible
terms.''
   Roache, in a statement issued after Shannon's report was
released, stressed that no one has filed a complaint against the
department.
   ``It is crucial to note that the attorney general has concluded
that there are no grounds for any legal action,'' the statement
said.
   The report found that homicide detectives appeared to have
threatened, coerced or offered favors to obtain testimony that
would implicate Bennett. Shannon said his report on the allegations
of coercion was incomplete because police had refused to cooperate
with the probe.
   But two men who were picked up by police for questioning, Dereck
Jackson and Eric Whitney, told investigators police threatened them
with jail and denied them access to attorneys.
   Jackson and Whitney were questioned by police after Jackson told
Whitney he had heard William Bennett's nephew jokingly say he
thought Bennett killed Stuart.
   Shannon said complaints about searches should be referred to his
office or the U.S. Attorney's office to be evaluated. In the past,
the police department's Internal Affairs Unit has overseen such
inquiries.
   ``But Internal Affairs has not done the job here,'' Shannon
said. ``Until the BPD has demonstrated that it can police its own
officers effectively, it must be carefully scrutinized by an
independent law enforcement agency.''
   Shannon denied that his report was little more than a slap on
the wrist for police, who are under no obligation to abide by its
recommendations.
   ``Litigation would accomplish nothing,'' Shannon said. ``I think
the public is going to demand these changes. The findings are so
substantial that they cannot be ignored.''
   Louis Elisa, head of the Boston chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, praised Shannon
for his ``comprhensive review.''
   But he said the report came so late in Shannon's term and
suggested that Shannon pass his findings on to the U.S. attorney to
take action.
   Shannon alleged in the report that Frank McGee, a lawyer for the
Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, advised officers not to
cooperate with the investigation.
   McGee said the allegations were false and that Shannon was
retaliating for the union's endorsement of Scott Harshbarger, who
defeated Shannon in the attorney general race.

<HEAD>Hundreds Daily Viewing Image at Auto Supply Store</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROGRESO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynaldo Trevino spends more time
preaching than selling auto parts now that hundreds of people daily
ignore his fan belts and radiator hoses to view what they believe
is the Virgin Mary's image on a bathroom floor.
   The image - varying shades of gray that Trevino said used to be
one color - appeared Dec. 3 on the cement floor of the shower stall
in the rear of his Progreso Auto Supply.
   He said something within his heart told him to spread the
message that the presence on the floor symbolized the way many
neglect their faith.
   ``So I started telling every customer who came in,'' Trevino
said Tuesday. ``Before I sold them a part, I took them back.''
   The word spread quickly. A steady procession of faithful and
curious now enter the store daily in the tiny town by the Mexican
border in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Some days more than 1,000 visit. About 100 per hour stopped at
the store Tuesday morning.
   Only a few came to buy auto parts.
   Over and over, Trevino told visitors the message he believes the
Virgin told him to spread: ``Share with your brothers, pray the
rosary, fast and look for Jesus and put him at the center of your
hearts.''
   They had to wind their way behind the counter and down a narrow
corridor past the shelves of inventory before reaching the restroom
at the back corner.
   Some knelt to pray by the shower stall, next to a toilet. Others
made the sign of the cross or touched the image they saw.
   They see the Virgin's image in the varying shades of gray
cement. A dark area about a foot wide appears in the shape of
common representations of the Virgin. What could be interpreted as
facial features are vaguely discernible.
   Others see more, including a woman Tuesday who said she saw an
earring, flowers and an angel to the side.
   ``She's so beautiful, so beautiful,'' 14-year-old Bonnie
Maldonado said, tears flowing from her eyes after leaving the
store.
   Her mother, Ernestina Maldonado, said she found it painful to
see the Virgin on the floor.
   ``I feel guilty,'' she said. ``I feel very, very guilty because
I feel like I'm part of this world. I'm part to blame for where she
is. In the process of trying to get ahead, we have lost our
values.''
   Trevino, 45, is Roman Catholic, like most who believe they see
the Virgin Mary at his store. Some don't see anything special, he
said.
   To aid viewing, Trevino placed in the shower a small picture of
the Virgin, along with a fluorescent desk lamp.
   He said he plans to make no money from the image and that his
business actually has suffered from his devotion of so much time to
his new religious mission.
   Trevino planned to sell the store until he saw the image. Now,
he said, he awaits guidance from God on what to do with the
business.
   He discourages photographs.
   ``I want them to take the image home with them in their
hearts,'' Trevino said.

<TEXT>
   The chaotic start of a sweepstakes promotion that
promised to put an American aboard the Soviet space station became
even more tangled Tuesday when the official Soviet news agency
called the contest a hoax.
   Complicating matters still further, Texas officials said they
were investigating to see whether the contest by Space Travel
Services violated state lottery laws.
   The Houston-based company announced Monday that callers to a 900
number had a chance to win six months' training, a trip aboard a
Soviet rocket and a week on the space station Mir.
   So many callers dialed the number to enter the sweepstakes - at
$2.99 a shot - that they knocked the Dallas-based phone system out
of service periodically Monday and Tuesday.
   ``We've been rather overwhelmed,'' James Davidson, senior vice
president of Space Travel, said Tuesday.
   The company's glee turned to confusion later in the day when
Tass denied reports of any deal involving Americans and Glavkosmos,
the Soviet space agency, and said it was a hoax.
   ``The Glavkosmos does not know anything about this project,''
Tass reported.
   Organizers in Houston termed the denial a misunderstanding.
   ``There's a limit to how much we can do to control Soviet
bureaucracy, and there's a limit to what we can do with Tass,''
said David Mayer, president of Space Travel.
   ``We basically have our contract in hand, so we know that we're
basically straight,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of us finding
out what's going on behind the scenes in the Soviet Union, to find
out where the confusion lies. It's obviously just a
misunderstanding and I don't think it will be that difficult to
clear up.''
   ``Space Travel Services Corp. has a legal contract with NPO
Energia for a trip to the Mir Space Station aboard a Soyuz
vehicle,'' company spokesman George Nelson said. ``Two contracts
are involved. One between Space Travel and Space Commerce Corp. of
Houston and a second between Space Commerce and NPO Energia of
Moscow.''
   Space Commerce Corp. is the company that negotiated with NPO
Energia on behalf of Space Travel. NPO Energia is the Soviet agency
that builds rockets and negotiates commercial deals for the Soviet
space program, but Glavkosmos must approve any contracts.
   Nelson said the Energia contract was signed by Uri Pavelovitch
Semenov, general designer in Energia's Moscow office, and was
delivered to Space Commerce with a cover letter signed by V.P.
Nikitskiy, deputy chairman of NPO Energia. Space Travel also has a
letter from Alexander I. Dunaev, chairman of Glavkosmos USSR
confirming that Energia has full authority to sign and execute that
contract.
   ``There were no deals on the subject,'' Tass quoted Vladimir
Zenkin, deputy commercial manager at the Energia agency.
   A Harris County assistant district attorney said Tuesday that
Mayer and Davidson were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury
Wednesday for questioning about the contest.
   ``Nobody's been charged with anything,'' said Russell
Turbeville, head of the district attorney's consumer fraud
division. ``There's just so much information coming from so many
sources so fast we just had to look into it.''
   ``We were concerned that even if it was not a hoax and the
arrangements were made properly with the Soviets, (the sweepstakes)
would violate state lottery laws,'' Turbeville said.
   It is a felony in Texas to charge people for a chance to win
something.
   Davidson said because people could enter the sweepstakes by mail
at no charge the contest did not violate state laws. Mayer said he
would submit to the grand jury a written opinion from his lawyers
saying the sweepstakes did not violate Texas laws.
   Earlier, Davidson said if the project fell through, callers
would get refunds.
   The contest is to culminate in December 1991 when an American is
selected in a random drawing for six months' training, a trip
aboard a Soviet rocket and a week on the Russian space station in
late 1992 or early 1993.
   Thousands of calls made to the 900 number Monday caused the
circuits at Wholesale Telephone to overload.
   ``We got a little bit buried, but I'm not embarrassed. We're
getting a lot of calls,'' said Larry Summers, president of
Wholesale Telephone. I'm kind of a space nut myself so I'm real
excited to see that.''
   He estimated that about 5,000 calls were missed overnight from
the service disruption. He said he worked all night to expand his
computer system's capacity to handle the volume.
   Summers and Davidson said they didn't know how many calls had
been received. Davidson said the system was able to handle 200
phone calls at once.
   ``For 200 people to call and lock up the system would require
several thousand people calling every hour,'' Davidson said.
   Summers said the calls to the 900 number are stored on digital
tape, with 17,686 messages per tape. Winners will be chosen by an
accounting firm that will randomly designate a location on a part
of the tape, he said.
   The grand prize includes the space ride plus $500,000 in cash,
Space Travel said. Or the sweepstakes winner can opt to stay on
Earth and collect $1.5 million in cash. A backup astronaut will be
picked from 11 potential candidates selected in the drawing,
Davidson said.
   Contest rules require that entrants be at least 18 and residents
of the United States. They are not required to be U.S. citizens.
Space Travel said because of local laws, residents of New York,
Florida or Rhode Island would not be eligible for the flight.
Deadline for the contest is Dec. 1, 1991.
   The exact cost of the trip was not disclosed, but Space Travel
officials have said it was more than the $12 million paid by a
Japanese broadcast company to put a reporter aboard the station.
   Besides income from the 900 number, for which Space Travel gets
more than 50 percent of the $2.99 per call, the company hopes to
lure advertisers eager to put their logos on the winner's spacesuit
and on the spacecraft or have the American cosmonaut endorse
certain products from space.

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi official on Tuesday claimed that
more than 2,000 children aged 4 or under have died because of
shortages in baby food and medicine caused by the U.N. embargo on
trade with Iraq.
   Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said blamed President Bush
for the deaths in a statement distributed by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
   ``Documented evidence of this high rate in childrens' death will
stand to condemn the crimes committed by Bush and his partners,''
INA quoted the minister as saying.
   He said 600 of the 2,042 children died in hospitals this month,
mainly due to shortages of vaccines that caused the spread of
contagious diseases like measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping
cough.
   Said claimed on Dec. 3 that 1,416 children had died because of
shortages resulting from the sanctions the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Iraq as punishment for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad have discounted the reports of
shortages, noting that the Security Council decided in October to
allow shipments of essential food and medicines to Iraq.
   The diplomats note that since mid-October, nearly 120 tons of
medicine have arrived from humanitarian groups worldwide, earmarked
for Iraqi children.
   Most of the shipments were in exchange for Western hostages
helped by Iraq until President Saddam Hussein announced a blanket
release on Dec. 6.
   Last week alone, Iraq's Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of
the Red Cross, announced it had received 22 tons of medical
supplies from Italy and another 28 tons from the United Nations'
Children Fund, UNICEF.
   But government hospitals still report shortages of vaccines,
antibiotics and baby formulas.
   Iraqis say they can buy medicine at pharmacies and on the black
market but the prices are at least five times higher than normal.
   Some diplomats and medical personnel in Baghdad suggested last

<HEAD>FNN Anual Report: $72.4 Million in Losses for 1990</HEAD>

   Financial News Network Inc. suffered losses
totaling $72.4 million for its 1990 fiscal year, the cable
television concern disclosed Tuesday.
   The reasons for FNN's reversal of fortune included accounting
changes totaling $65 million. The company said the changes regarded
improperly documented lease transactions, new product development
costs and payments to its sister company, United Press
International.
   FNN and UPI are subsidiaries of Infotechnology Inc.
   FNN said it was in the process of revising its quarterly reports
for the first three quarters of 1990 to reflect a review conducted
by by FNN and its new accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   Last month FNN said it expected a net loss of $72.5 million for
the 1990 fiscal year.
   Last year, for the fiscal year ending in 1989, FNN recorded a
profit over $3 million, but those figures were unaudited. The
company's fiscal year ends June 30.
   Financial News Network provides business, sports and market data
to cable systems in the United States and Canada. FNN and
Infotechnology collectively own 51 percent of the Learning Channel,
and Infotechnology also has investments in other media,
communications and biotechnology companies.
   In October, FNN dismissed C. Steven Bolen, chief financial
officer, for improper financial dealings. FNN also dismissed its
auditors, Deloitte &amp; Touche in a disagreement over accounting
methods.
   The FNN annual report stated that a company investigation
concluded Bolen had payments made to himself totaling $794,061 that
were ``not properly authorized and not properly identified on
(FNN's) books.''
   ``Through his counsel, Mr. Bolen claimed that such payments were
earned by him as incentive compensation for arranging financing for
the company,'' the filing stated.
   FNN said it was considering suing Bolen to recover the money.
   Originally at issue in the dispute with Deloitte &amp; Touche was
how FNN was reporting its $28 million investment in a new service.
Deloitte contended the investment should have been deducted from
quarterly earnings - which would have put FNN in the red - rather
than spread out over several years.
   Because of the dispute, FNN was unable to file its annual
financial reports with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30.
In addition, Deloitte withdrew its opinions on FNN's and Infotech's
1989 financial statements.
   Last month FNN said it expected a net loss of $72.5 million for
the 1990 fiscal year.

<HEAD>Doctor Donates Half of Nobel Prize Award to Cancer Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, whose pioneering bone
marrow transplants offered new hope to leukemia patients, donated
his half of the more than $700,000 Nobel Prize award to a cancer
center.
   Thomas gave the money to Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, where he is a physician and a researcher.
   Thomas shared this year's Nobel in medicine with Dr. Joseph E.
Murray of Boston. Thomas and Murray were credited with performing
critical experiments that opened the door to successful organ
transplantation in humans.
   Thomas, 70, announced his gift to the cancer center at a
reception and dinner Monday night.
   Thomas said he felt he couldn't keep the money for himself
because the decades of research that led to his prize were the sums
of efforts involving many Hutchinson staff members and several
other Seattle hospitals.
   ``We even want to pay income tax on this money,'' Thomas said.
``We thank all of you for this wonderful occasion.''
   He was given two long standing ovations.
   Thomas, also a professor of medicine and oncology at the
University of Washington, performed the first human bone marrow
transplant in 1956 on sets of identical twins in which one twin had
severe leukemia. While the transplant was successful and not
rejected, the patient with the cancer eventually died from the
disease.
   Most medical researchers then dismissed marrow transplantation
as impossible, but Thomas and his colleagues persevered.
   Thomas helped refine the procedure, during which cancerous bone
marrow is replaced with healthy marrow from a donor.
   Today, bone marrow transplantation is considered the preferred
treatment for some leukemia and lymphoma patients who otherwise
would not survive.
   Thousands of such operations have been performed at Hutchinson.
   Murray, 71, and a retired Harvard Medical School professor, in
1954 performed the first successful kidney transplant in identical
twins at what is now the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

   Arab lawyers from Jerusalem and the occupied
West Bank on Tuesday urged the international community to intervene
to stop Israel from deporting Palestinian activists.
   The plea came as an army judicial panel considered the appeal of
four leaders of the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement who have
been ordered expelled by the Israeli government.
   The expulsion orders also gave America room to back a proposed
U.N. resolution criticizing the Jewish state, diplomats said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   The deportation orders were issued after Hamas slogans claimed
responsibility for the stabbing deaths of three Israelis last
Friday.
   The government has not accused the four men of involvement in
the killings but said they incited others to violence. All four are
from the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said U.S. support of the U.N.
resolution ``opposes the American interest at this time.''
   ``Because in essence any decision against Israel in the Security
Council is liable to be an achievement for Saddam Hussein,'' Iraq's
president, Shamir said.
   Saddam has tried to link a resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis
with the Palestinian issue. A non-binding section in the resolution
would endorse a Mideast peace conference, but it stresses the gulf
crisis and the conference are not linked.
   At a news conference in Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian lawyers
said they feared Israel planned extensive deportations.
   ``News and reports have confirmed the existence of another list
containing tens of Palestinians who will be candidates for
deportation,'' said Ali Ghuzlan, president of the Arab Lawyers
Committee.
   The committee charged Israel was ``paving the road before the
collective transfer'' of Palestinians from their homeland.
   ``We as lawyers strongly condemn this policy and urge the local,
Israeli and world opinion ... to ask for the immediate cancellation
of the emergency regulations'' under which the deportations are
ordered, its statement said.
   Israeli had been reported planning 14 expulsions in all. Later
reports said the number was scaled back because of U.S. objections.
   Nazem Oweida, a Gaza lawyer for the Hamas activists, complained
Tuesday of insufficient time to prepare his case.
   ``We were surprised to get hundreds of pages of material, some
of it blurry and not translated,'' Oweida said. ``We asked for a
week to look at it, and we got only 24 hours.''
   Oweida said he would appeal to the Supreme Court if the military
panel ruled against them. Deportation orders have never been
overturned by Israeli courts.
   Israel reinstituted its deportation policy after a lapse of 16
months to try to calm rising public fears over Arab attacks on
Jews.
   The decision drew immediate criticism from the U.S. State
Department, which said the expulsions violated the Fourth Geneva
Convention protecting the rights of peoples under occupation.
   Before deportations were suspended in August 1989, reportedly at
U.S. urging, 60 Palestinians had been expelled for alleged
involvement in the now 3-year-old uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shops and offices in the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem were
closed Tuesday in a strike called by Hamas to protest the expulsion
orders.
   The Israeli government also drew criticism from its right-wing
supporters.
   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan of the far-right Tsomet Party
described the planned deportation of four Moslem activists as
``very late and in a very small amount.''
   He urged the government not to make public in advance its
deportation plans to avoid any international outcry. ``Let the
press find out about it two weeks later,'' Eitan said on army
radio.
   Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a senior member of Shamir's Likud bloc, was
quoted in Israeli newspapers as saying the government was failing
to protect Israelis.
   ``The government's policy will, in the end, bring about the
abandonment of Judea and Samaria,'' he said, using the biblical
terms for the West Bank.
   Retaining control of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel seized
in the 1967 Middle East war, is a pillar of Likud's platform.

<TEXT>
   A segregationist who has stood trial twice
in the 1963 ambush slaying of civil rights leader Medgar Evers
faces a third trial after being indicted on new evidence.
   Byron De La Beckwith, 70, of Signal Mountain, Tenn., is charged
with murder in the shooting death of Evers, field secretary for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Justice can be only served if there is a final conclusion,
once and for all,'' District Attorney Ed Peters said Tuesday.
Peters said the re-indictment was issued Friday by a grand jury in
Jackson.
   Beckwith, who is in poor health and advancing years, still
espouses white supremacy and flies the Confederate flag outside his
home.
   He was arrested Monday at his house on a fugitive warrant issued
by the state of Mississippi.
   Beckwith was released on $15,000 bond after a court appearance
in Chattanooga, Tenn. His next court appearance was set for Feb.
22.
   Beckwith said he intends to fight extradition.
   ``I'm going to resist tooth, nail and claw because I think all
this is nonsense, poppycock and something to stir the people up ...
and incite the lower forms of life to force and violence against
the country clubs,'' he said during his court appearance.
   If extradited, Beckwith will stand trial in the June 12, 1963,
death of Evers, 37, who was shot while standing in the driveway of
his Jackson home.
   Beckwith can be tried again without double jeopardy because no
verdict was ever reached. His two previous trials ended with
deadlocked juries. Also, no statute of limitations exists in murder
cases.
   ``Although Beckwith was vigorously prosecuted in 1964, those
prosecutions did not have the benefit of certain evidence
accumulated during the course of our investigation,'' Peters said.
   Peters did not disclose the new evidence and refused to answer
questions from reporters.
   He did say, however, that individuals, both black and white,
``have taken the courageous step of coming forward.'' He said their
identities would not be revealed but that they had agreed to
testify.
   Evers led black voter registration drives in Mississippi and
filed complaints with the federal government concerning civil
rights violations.
   The assassination helped focus national attention on the civil
rights struggle in Mississippi and helped push forward civil rights
reforms.
   Beckwith's fingerprint was found on a rifle discarded near the
scene; he claimed the rifle had been stolen from his home.
   After his two trials in 1964, both times before all-white
juries, the murder charge against Beckwith was dismissed in 1969.
   The investigation was reopened amid allegations of jury and
evidence tampering by the state Sovereignty Commission, a state
segregationist watchdog agency that went out of business in 1973.
Prosecutors later said they found no evidence of jury tampering.
   ``Without a conviction in this case we must believe that
everything Medgar fought and died for was meaningless,'' said
Evers' widow, Myrlie Evers of Los Angeles.
   ``I hope that it is the foreteller of the kind of justice
attitude that becomes a reality,'' said Aaron Henry, president of
the state NAACP since 1960.
   ``It's about time for us to clean up our act and see that
justice is done in this case,'' said Vicksburg Mayor Robert Walker,
who was field secretary of the state NAACP during 1980-84.
   In a telephone interview Saturday, Beckwith said another trial
would be a popularity contest but that he expected to be cleared.
   ``Whites are the most numerous. ... I know where the power and
the authority in Mississippi lays because I was raised in the
middle of it,'' he said.
   ``If I didn't know what was going on down there, I wouldn't be
so cheerful up here,'' he said from his home.
   Beckwith has been an outspoken opponent of integration since
1954, when he joined the pro-segregation Citizens Council. After
his trials in the Evers slaying, Beckwith ran for lieutenant
governor in 1967, collecting 34,675 of the 665,539 votes cast and
finishing fifth among six candidates.
   In 1973, he was convicted in Louisiana of possessing dynamite
without a permit and served five years in prison.

   The last two British Embassy staffers in Kuwait,
who held out against isolation and intimidation for nearly four
months, on Tuesday arrived in London to be reunited with their
families.
   Ambassador Michael Weston and Consul Larry Banks were greeted by
their wives and colleagues at Heathrow Airport after arriving from
Amman, Jordan. The two traveled via Baghdad.
   ``It is tremendous to be home - if a little cold,'' said Weston,
who hugged his wife, Christine. ``The last time I spoke to my wife
was on Aug. 1, so it is wonderful to be back.''
   Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. A U.S.-led multinational
force has since assembled in the Persian Gulf to demand Iraq's
withdrawal by Jan. 15.
   The Westons and Larry and Elizabeth Banks were welcomed by
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg, who said, ``Their efforts
have been magnificent. They have done an extremely good job both in
supporting the residents in Kuwait and also in keeping us fully
informed as to what is going on.''
   Weston has said Banks grew vegetables to feed them and dug wells
for water.
   After the Aug. 24 deadline by which all embassies in Kuwait were
to close, Iraqi forces cut water and electricity to embassies, and
troops were deployed outside their gates.
   Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister John Major warned Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that time was running out.
   ``Insofar as a solution of the gulf crisis is concerned, I must
say that that rests squarely with Saddam Hussein,'' Major said in
Parliament.
   ``Time is running out for him. The international community has
made it quite clear that force will be used if Iraq has not
withdrawn totally and unconditionally from Kuwait by Jan. 15,'' he
said.

   President Bush on Tuesday was still mulling
over a list of candidates for national Republican Party chairman
and a top aide said he was not likely to make the selection before
the end of the week.
   Among the names emerging as strong contenders, according to
administration officials were those of GOP political operative Rich
Bond and outgoing New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers.
   Carruthers was summoned to the White House on Tuesday by Chief
of Staff John Sununu, his New Mexico office said. Sununu earlier
asked him to replace outgoing drug policy director William Bennett,
but Carruthers turned it down, said his press secretary Eddie
Binder.
   Arriving in New Mexico Tuesday evening, Carruthers said he made
a commitment to help in the Bush re-election campaign, but he
declined to say whether he was offered to position of party
chairman.
   However, the administration sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity said other names were still live prospects for RNC
chairman as well. They said Bush was keeping very close counsel on
the matter and was likely to announce the decision on very short
notice.
   One senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was a chance of less than 20 percent that Bush would make a
final decision on the matter before leaving at the end of the week
to spend the Christmas holiday at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md.
   The official said there was no real pressure to make a quick
decision, since the Republican National Committee, which
technically will choose its chairman does not meet until Jan. 25.
The RNC is expected to rubber stamp Bush's choice.
   The official said aides had given him a list of 12 to 15
possible candidates, and that Bush was adding and subtracting his
own candidates.
   The search has resumed since Bush's first choice, outgoing drug
policy director Bennett, accepted and then rejected the offer
saying he had too many financial aspirations that might pose
conflict of interest questions.
   Many White House officials are lining up behind Bond's
candidacy, going with his strength as a political strategist in
lieu of a bombastic public speaker like Bennett, according to some
sources.
   After Bennett rejected the post, administration officials were
divided on whether it would be better to find a flashy public
personage or pick someone who had more campaign strategy
credentials.
   Among the potential candidates in the former category, the names
of Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner, Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp and outgoing Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., were mentioned,
along with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   In the political operative category, names that still were
mentioned on Tuesday were former Rep. Tom Loeffler, now a Texas
attorney, and Michigan GOP Chairman Spencer Abraham, a political
aide to Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Bond who organized the Iowa caucuses for Bush in the 1988
presidential campaign and then served as political director, is
credited with helping to solidify the Republican base for Bush. He
now has a Virginia consulting business.
   Carruthers was elected governor in 1986 and was barred by law
from seeking a second term this year. His term is up Jan. 1, and he
has indicated he would like to take some time out from public life.
He told Sununu that when he was offered a chance to be considered
or drug czar, said Binder.
   Carruthers also served as state GOP chairman in new Mexico and
was an assistant interior secretary from 1981 to 1984.

<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday revoked $300,000 bail for the
accused murderer of Rabbi Meir Kahane and said he received death
threats for his handling of the case.
   The judge, Alvin Schlesinger, said virtually all of hundreds of
letters and telephone calls he got urged him to keep El Sayyid
Nosair in jail, but he said they had no influence on his decision
to revoke bail.
   He had stayed the bail pending the hearing and Nosair was never
released.
   Schlesinger said he changed his mind because he was able ``to
drag out of'' Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum
information that Nosair had used five different addresses for
questionable reasons.
   ``With respect to the threats on my life, my reaction to those
has been revulsion, contempt and outrage,'' the judge said.
   Schlesinger refused to say who or where the threats came from,
but said some of the individuals who contacted him ``ought to know
better.''
   Greenbaum told the judge Nosair had manuals on gun use and bomb
making in his Cliffside Park, N.J., home. And police recovered a
bullet-pocked wall that had apparently been used for target
practice.
   Schlesinger said he noticed that the last name of Nosair's wife
and child on their passports were different from his. He said
Nosair's passport had the last name Abdul-Azziz. All were United
States passports.
   A vial of sodium cyanide that Greenbaum said was in Nosair's
locker in the courthouse basement where he worked in Manhattan
could be used to poison someone or to commit suicide, Schlesinger
said.
   Greenbaum told Schlesinger perfect ballistics matches were made
between the gun found on the street next to Nosair when he was
captured and the bullets that came out of Kahane and other victims.
   ``It appears to me that the prosecutor has what we refer to in
the courthouse as a rather strong case,'' Schlesinger said.
   The judge chided the prosecutor for not giving him enough
information in the first bail hearing two weeks ago to make an
intelligent decision about whether Nosair ought to be remanded.
   Nosair, 35, is an Egyptian immigrant who came to this country in
1981. He is charged with murder for allegedly shooting the Zionist
rabbi through the neck Nov. 5 as Kahane finished speaking to a
Jewish group in Manhattan.
   Nosair is also charged with the attempted murder of two men he
is accusing of wounding as he allegedly tried to get away.
   One of the defendant's alleged victims, U.S. Postal Service
Police Officer Carlos Acosta, shot Nosair in the neck between his
chin and throat. Nosair recovered and has been moved from Bellevue
Hospital to Rikers Island.
   Schlesinger scheduled Nosair for another hearing March 5.

<TEXT>
   Japan's financial contribution to the Gulf
crisis was defended by a senior Japanese diplomat Tuesday as not
less than what the United States requested.
   ``I think the Japanese contribution is comparable to the whole
of Western Europe's,'' which has an economy twice the size of
Japan, said Takayuki Kimura, deputy chief of his country's
Washington embassy.
   He appeared at a news conference to answer accusations that
Japan was shirking a fair share of crisis burden, considering its
status as the world's second strongest economic power and its heavy
dependence on Middle East oil.
   Kimura was asked repeatedly if the $4 billion Japanese financial
contribution shown in tables handed reporters was considered enough
in light of the possibility that U.S. and other lives may be
sacrificed if the crisis brings war, and a reported $30 billion
cost to America for the military buildup.
   The tables and other information disclosed that much of the
contribution pledged by Japan has not yet been disbursed and much
of $2 billion to help Egypt, Turkey and Jordan as countries
particularly hurt by the international trade embargo against Iraq
is in the form of loans rather than grants.
   All the loans are ``untied,'' meaning they need not be spent in
Japan, Kimura said. Grants would have required time-consuming law
changes while low one percent interest rates and long 30-year
repayment terms make the loans worth 80 percent as much as grants,
he added.
   To suggestions that approximately $2 billion in financing,
equipment and transportation for U.S. forces is ``too little and
too slow,'' Kimura said the Pentagon prefers payment in kind, and
military procurement simply takes time. About $600 million of the
first $1 billion has been spent or contracted and an additional $1
billion just approved by parliament will soon be paid, the embassy
said.
   The U.S. government has ``a general idea'' of how much more
Japan would contribute if the crisis led to war, Kimura said. It
was up to the United States to disclose the amount of its requests,
he said, adding in answer to a question that the Japanese
conribution was ``not less than what they asked.''
   The U.N. Security Council and the U.S.-led multinational
military force have set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait. Japanese and German forces are not part of the
27-nation multinational force as a result of restrictions on
sending soldiers overseas that stem from their defeat in World War
II.

   A State Department employee at a passport office
was arrested on charges of helping violent drug dealers get illegal
passports, authorities said Tuesday.
   Kenneth R. Weatherspoon was charged Monday in a federal
indictment with helping heroin and cocaine dealers illegally obtain
passports between June 1986 and February 1988.
   Federal agents arrested Weatherspoon Thursday at the passport
office in Rockefeller Center in Manhattann, prosecutors said. He
pleaded innocent and was freed on $50,000 bail.
   Andrew Laine, a spokesman for the State Department, said
Weatherspoon was no longer working at the passport office, but said
the agency had not yet determined if he would be fired.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said Weatherspoon conspired with
Eric Vassel, the alleged leader of the ``Gulleymen'' gang, and
others to obtain passports for gang members.
   ``State Department records reveal that between 1986 and 1988,
Weatherspoon knowingly processed and approved over 35 fraudulent
passport applications,'' Maloney said. He said that at least two of
the passports went to members of Vassel's Jamaican gang.
   In a crackdown earlier this month, federal agents arrested 17
members of the Gulleymen gang, an organization that allegedly
controlled crack houses in Brooklyn and Dallas. The drug ring has
been linked to at least 10 killings.
   Drug dealers, illegal aliens and others who wanted passports
allegedly paid $2,500 to a middleman who assisted them in getting
the documents through Weatherspoon, prosecutors said.
   Weatherspoon, 53, of Brooklyn also was indicted on charges of
helping Edwards and members of his crack gang illegally get
passports. Edwards was convicted in 1989 of federal racketeering
charges that included six murders and was sentenced to seven
consecutive life sentences.
   If convicted, Weatherspoon faces a maximum of five years in
prison.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Order Allowing Daily News Hawkers in Transit System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday extended the Daily News'
right to employ hawkers in subway and railroad stations in an
eight-week strike.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum granted the tabloid a
preliminary injunction that replaces a previous order, which was to
expire Thursday.
   The Daily News says it depends on hawkers to distribute the
newspaper because virtually all newsstands stopped carrying the
paper after nine of its 10 unions went on strike Oct. 25.
   The judge said the injunction would remain in effect until the
News' lawsuit against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
resolved.
   The lawsuit claims the Daily News' First Amendment right to free
speech was violated when the transit authority rescinded permits
late last month that had allowed hawkers to sell the News in the
transit system.
   The transit authority said it terminated the permits because of
concerns that striking newspaper employees would set up picket
lines that would be honored by transit workers.
   The judge noted that it would be illegal for the transit workers
to honor picket lines because public employees are barred under law
from striking.
   Transit authority spokesman Tito Davila said lawyers were likely
to appeal Cedarbaum's ruling.
   The News has published daily during the strike but has had major
problems in circulation and advertising.
   Before the strike, it was the third-largest metropolitan daily,
with circulation of 1.09 million. The News' circulation is now
about 600,000.

<HEAD>Former Assessor Accused of Using Taxes for Payback Against
Ex-Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former member of the Hull Board of Assessors was
accused Tuesday of taking revenge against an ex-girlfriend by
helping raise her property tax bill.
   The State Ethics Commission accused Stephen Malcolm of violating
the Massachusetts conflict-of-interest law.
   According to an order filed by the commission, Malcolm became
romantically involved with a Hull resident in March 1987 and the
relationship ended a couple months later with bad feelings on both
sides.
   Later that year, Malcolm told a subordinate that the
ex-girlfriend wanted her tax assessment increased because she was
planning to put her house up for sale and she wanted to ask a
higher price than what was reflected by its assessment at the time,
the order said.
   The woman had no plans to sell her house and didn't request a
reassessment, the order said.
   The assessment on her property rose from $40,300 to $122,700,
resulting in a $2,000 tax increase. Later, the Board of Assessors
re-evaluated the property and approved a tax reduction.
   Malcolm said the charges were ``ludicrous.''
   He said the home was assessed too low and his actions had
nothing to do with his feelings about the woman.

<TEXT>
   The state's top judge violated the U.S.
Constitution when he banned the filming of ``The Bonfire of the
Vanities'' from the Essex County Courthouse, a federal judge ruled
Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan harshly criticized Robert
Wilentz, chief justice of the state Supreme Court, saying he
violated the First Amendment by banning the filming.
   Wilentz said he would appeal.
   ``I have advised all assignment judges that pending the outcome
of the appeal, no filming will be allowed in the courthouses of New
Jersey. This order does not apply to the filming or televising of
actual court proceedings, which may continue as in the past,'' he
said in a statement.
   Wilentz barred filming of the movie scenes inside the ornate
courthouse in May. He argued that the depiction of rioting black
characters would undermine what little faith blacks have left in
the justice system.
   Wilentz said in an affidavit that he is constitutionally
permitted and even duty-bound to consider whether the content of a
movie scene is ``inappropriate for the judiciary to be associated
with.''
   Essex County Executive Nicholas Amato sued Wilentz in May,
claiming the chief judge trampled on the First Amendment and
deprived the county of a $250,000 donation from Warner Bros.
   Politan ruled in the county's favor, but did not grant the
$250,000 monetary award the county sought.
   ``By acting to further his concern for the welfare of the black
community, (Wilentz) egregiously trammelled a fundamental bulwark
against the spread of governmental despotism,'' Politan wrote.
   Wilentz had offered to let the company film if they would change
a scene, but producer Fred Caruso declined.
   The film, based on Tom Wolfe's novel, looks at New York's legal
system, illuminating the city's racial and class divisions.
   ``The film is not about, nor is it designed to document rioting
blacks any more so than it is designed to malign drunken English
reporters or greedy philandering white men,'' Politan wrote.

<HEAD>Army Prosecutor Recommends Death Penalty for Rebel Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army prosecutor recommended to
the nation's highest military court on Tuesday that five leaders of
the Dec. 3 rebellion be shot by firing squad.
   The recommendation by Carlos Dominguez, a retired general,
applies to retired Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, Col. Luis Baraldini,
retired Lt. Col. Osvaldo Tevere, Maj. Pedro Mercado and retired
Maj. Hugo Abete.
   Ten other officers ranging from captain to colonel would be
cashiered and sentenced to prison terms of three to 22 years.
   The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which operates under
the Military Code of Justice, has been taking testimony from loyal
and rebel officers for two weeks. It is expected to issue a ruling
by year's end.
   President Carlos Menem and army chief Gen. Martin Bonnet have
endorsed the death penalty for rebel leaders. They claim the rebels
intended to assassinate them both and topple the government in the
fourth such insurrection in less than four years.
   However, the rebels have the right to appeal the council's
verdict in civilian court, where the most severe punishment is life
imprisonment.
   Seineldin, a former commando who led an uprising in December
1988, accepted responsibility for the latest revolt even though he
was locked in a military prison 1,000 west of Buenos Aires.
   Baraldini led the takeover of the joint chiefs-of-staff
headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires, from which shots were fired
that hit Vice President Eduardo Duhalde's helicopter as it landed
atop Government House 150 yards away.
   Until two weeks ago, Baraldini was chief of the Buenos Aires
Military District.
   Abete and Tevere led the takeover of the Palermo infantry base 8
miles north of downtown.
   The base's second-in-command, Lt. Col. Hernan Pita, and a
private, were shot and killed. That helped propel the government to
fight the rebels rather than negotiate a settlement, which it did
in the three previous insurrections that have occurred since April
1987.
   Thirteen soldiers and civilians died during the one-day
insurrection.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down State Rule On AIDS Test</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court Tuesday struck
down a state rule forbidding health insurane companies from
considering HIV test results when deciding on applications.
   The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed, without comment,
lower court decisions against the state Insurance Department
regulation.
   The policy banned insurance companies from considering the
results of HIV blood tests in deciding insurability for small group
and individual plans. A person testing positive for the human
immunodeficiency virus is considered likely to develop symptoms of
AIDS.
   The department argued there were questions about the reliability
of HIV tests. Testing positive for the HIV virus also doesn't mean
a person is sick with AIDS and should be denied insurance, the
department said.
   ``We're disappointed in the decision,'' said Kevin Foley,
spokesman for the Insurance Department. ``We obviously saw it in a
different way. We're going to review our policies and continue to
look for ways to make sure the health insurance system is as
inclusive as possible.''
   A lawyer for the Health Insurance Association of America, which
challenged the rule, said he believed the decision was fair to the
group's clients and customers. The lawyer, Chris Petersen, said the
Legislatere should decide such policy questions.
   ``If they're going to talk in terms of social policy, it's more
important to go through the legislative process,'' Petersen said.
   The department adopted the new rule in 1987, but it was
challenged by the insurance industry before it could ever take
effect. While the rule has been tied up in litigation, insurance
companies have been allowed to take HIV test results into account
when making decisions, Foley said.
   Since test results aren't taken into account in large group
insurance policies and people who already have insurance who
develop AIDS symptoms remain covered, Petersen said the rule was
likely to affect a relatively small number of people.
   New York state, with 33,674 reported AIDS cases since the
epidemic started through the end of October, has more AIDS patients
than any other state in the country, the state Health Department
said.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers hauled bodies from the icy
North Atlantic and brought back five survivors suffering from
hypothermia Tuesday after two fishing boats sank about 500 miles
apart off eastern Canada.
   The sinkings left 11 people dead or presumed dead. The survivors
owed their lives to enclosed life rafts or in one case, a survival
suit.
   Eight people were dead or believed dead from the Nadine, a
100-foot dragger out of Cap-aux-Meules, chief port of Quebec's
Iles-de-la-Madeleine. The vessel took in water and sank in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence about 18 miles south of its home port Monday
morning.
   The captain, Robert Poirier, and his brother survived and were
being treated for subnormal body temperatures after spending eight
hours in the water, said Iranae Bernard, fleet manager for the
company that owned the dragger. The skipper was plucked from a life
raft and his brother was found floating in open water in a survival
suit - an insulated rubber outfit that encloses the body from head
to toe, except from the eyes to the chin.
   In the second sinking, the 60-foot-long Strait's Pride from
O'Donnell's, Newfoundland, went down at 3:30 p.m. Monday, roughly
30 miles northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland.
   Three crew survived by launching an inflatable life raft and
zipping themselves in. Three didn't make the life raft and perished
in the open sea.
   Planes and ships searched for survivors and bodies.
   Four bodies from the Nadine were recovered and four people
aboard were missing and believed dead, including Estelle Laberge,
40, a federal fisheries observer.
   Bernard said some Nadine dead were wearing survival suits but
may not have been experienced enough to ensure they were properly
sealed against the cold.
   ``There's no further sightings and we're really not expecting to
find anybody alive at this time,'' said Capt. Pat Phelan of the
rescue co-ordination center in Halifax.
   The Strait's Pride's life raft was spotted by a rescue plane,
then picked up by a coast guard ship shortly after Monday midnight.
The raft was tossed by 15-foot waves and 55 mph winds for about
nine hours.
   The bodies of the three other crew were found just before noon
Tuesday, their life jackets still on.

   An Arctic cold front Tuesday brought winter to much of the West
and Northwest with heavy snow and strong winds that created numbing
windchills to 50 degrees below zero.
   A blizzard raged in northwestern Montana and an avalanche
bulletin was issued in southern Montana.
   Temperatures in northern Washington state plummeted and snow
began to fall as the arctic weather front plunged into the state
with winds up to 75 mph.
   Winter storm watches through Wednesday were posted from northern
Arizona up through Nevada, the northern half of Utah, western
Oregon, and the interior of northwest Washington state.
   Storms dumped up to 3.5 inches of rain in West Virginia,
flooding roads and shutting schools.
   In Kentucky, flooding forced the evacuation at least 20 homes in
low-lying areas of Hopkinsville near the Little River as steady
rain fell on already soggy ground, sending many other streams over
their banks across Kentucky.
   In Lynnville, Ky., a man was killed and two others were injured
when a bridge collapsed into a creek swollen by rain.
   At midday rainshowers were scattered over Mississippi, northern
Alabama, Georgia and northwest Florida.
   Rain fell over much of New England, New York state, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, southern
Indiana, southern Illinois and western lower Michigan.
   Rain also extended along the northern half of the Pacific Coast.
   Snow extended from east central Illinois across the remainder of
Indiana, northwest Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, western
Wyoming, northwest Colorado, northeast Oregon, southwest Washington
and the Washington Cascades.
   Heavier rainfall totals included 2.32 inches at Jackson, Ky.,
and 1.27 inches Nashville, Tenn.
   Snowfall totals included 6 inches at Helena, Mont., 3 inches at
Glasgow and Kalispell, Mont., and 2 inches at Great Falls, Mont.
   High temperature records were set in Bristol, Tenn., 73,
Huntsville, Ala., 73, Roanoke, Va., 68, and Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
tied 72.
   Tuesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 17 below zero
at Alamosa, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 6 below

<HEAD>Two Detained in Connection With Deaths During Religious Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police detained two people in connection
with the deaths of 12 worshipers who suffered carbon monoxide
poisoning during a religious ceremony, authorities said Tuesday.
   The two, including a daughter of one of the victims, may be
charged with abandonment, said Jose Nunez de Carceres, the Tijuana
state judicial police chief.
   The pair found the victims Thursday in a shantytown home where
the group had been participating in a religious rite, but they
failed to notify authorities, Nunez said.
   ``Instead of calling the authorities when they found the people
lying on the floor they went to look for a medium to see if she
could revive them,'' Nunez said. ``But when they returned the
police were there.''
   The pair were held at a Tijuana jail. Nunez said the case would
be turned over to the district attorney's office, which will
determine whether charges will be filed.
   Meanwhile, San Diego FBI agents were unable to confirm reports
that the state government of Baja California has asked for
assistance in identifying and locating two U.S. citizens who
reportedly participated in the ceremony.
   ``That is possible but we haven't received any formal request,''
Special Agent Bob Harmon said Tuesday.
   Baja California police released a report Monday confirming that
the 12 victims had died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Authorities also said tissue and blood tests indicated that the
victims had not consumed alcohol or another toxic substance as
first suspected.
   Those findings should end speculation that they were poisoned
deliberately through food or a fruit punch served at the ceremony,
said Jaime Sam Fierro, the state judicial police commander in
Tijuana.
   ``There is no evidence that the food or punch was
contaminated,'' Fierro said.
   More tests will be conducted on organ tissue samples of the
three female victims. Those results are not expected to indicate
another cause of death, Pallares said.
   Doctors at the Tijuana hospital where five survivors were taken
have said that the patients' symptoms indicated they had ingested
some type of poison.
   The all-night ceremony - which began Wednesday on the feast day
of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patroness of Mexico - was led by
Federico Padres Mexia, a self-styled spiritual leader. Padres, 61,
had conducted similar sessions for about the past month at his
house in a shantytown east of Tijuana.
   Authorities say the carbon monoxide that asphyxiated the victims
was emitted by a leaky butane gas lamp used to light the
unventilated residence. Homes in the neighborhood don't have
electricity, forcing residents to rely on gas tanks inside their
homes for heating and light.
   Three survivors, including Padres, were still in a coma and
listed in grave condition Tuesday.
   Two other survivors, Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, and his
8-month-old daughter, Ana Karina, were discharged Monday and
returned to their family home in Culiacan, Sinaloa.

<TEXT>
   A leader of Albania's first non-Communist
party predicted Tuesday it may soon be granted official
recognition.
   Gramoz Pashko said three Democratic Party representatives met
with Justice Minister Enver Halili after a parliamentary commission
headed by President Ramiz Alia approved a decree legalizing
politicalparties.
   Halili said the new party's application for registration would
``probably be approved soon,'' Pashko said by telephone from
Tirana, the Albanian capital.
   He said he expected the government to help his party get started
by providing a headquarters, telephones and other communications
equipment.
   By law, the government must act on the application within 30
days.
   After four days of student protests, leaders of Europe's last
Stalinist nation decided last week to break with 45 years of
one-party rule and allow formation of non-Communist political
organizations. The Democratic Party was created Wednesday.
   The Democratic Party of Albania estimates it is supported by
about 20,000 Albanians. The Communist Party claims more than
120,000 members among the Balkan nation's 3.2 million residents.
   On Thursday and Friday, thousands of anti-government protesters
rioted in four cities. More than 150 people were reported arrested,
but there was no word Tuesday on when their trials would begin.
   Pashko said that under the new decree all parties can apply for
registration, provided their platforms are not fascist or racist.
Their membership must be limited to Albanians living permanently in
the country and the parties may not receive funding from abroad.
   Another Democratic Party member, Rama Shinasi, said by telephone
that more than 1,000 students rallied in Tirana on Monday to urge
the party's swift legalization and the release of political
prisoners.
   They petitioned Alia to disband local Communist Party
committees, remove a statue of Stalin from Tirana and agree to
talks with opposition leaders and intellectuals, Shinasi said.
   In other developments, 28 Albanians used improvised rafts to
cross the Bojana River and enter Yugoslavia early Tuesday, the
official Yugoslavian news agency Tanjug reported. More than 600
Albanians have crossed into Yugoslavia this year without government
permission.
   The Communist daily Zeri i Popullit, meanwhile, reported police
arrested two men who had a total of 30 sticks of dynamite and 25
grenades. One man was arrested in Tirana and the other was detained
in Fier, 90 miles south of the capital, the paper said. It gave no
further details.
   In Geneva, British and Albanian officials met Tuesday to discuss
resuming diplomatic relations, said a British Foreign Office
spokesman.
   Relations were severed in 1939 when Italy occupied Albania.
Postwar attempts to restore relations were dashed when two British
warships were sunk by mines near Corfu, Greece, off Albania.
   The International Court of Justice ruled that Albania should pay
compensation of $1.6 million for the warships, but the Albanians
refused.
   Britain has held some Albanian gold pending resolution of the
dispute.

   Iraq's offer to donate 550 tons of dates to the
Soviet Union was rejected because Iraq also is incurring food
shortages, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Tuesday.
   Churkin told a news briefing the decision to turn down food aid
from Iraq's Red Crescent was made by the Soviet Red Cross and Red
Crescent organizations.
   ``Iraq itself is suffering from food shortages,'' he said.
   More than a dozen countries have offered to donate food to help
feed the Soviets this winter or guarantee loans so the Soviet
government can buy food.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's close ally and major arms supplier
until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Moscow has
since supported all U.N. Security Council resolutions and economic
sanctions against Baghdad.

   Opposition lawmakers battled police and
ripped out microphones during a rowdy session Tuesday of Taiwan's
Parliament to demand amnesty for a dissident leader.
   Officials said one policeman was hospitalized with fractured
ribs, but none of the legislators was injured.
   Members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who
control 19 of Parliament's 244 seats, have often triggered fights
to oppose bills proposed by the governing Nationalist Party, which
has 199 seats.
   Tuesday's brawl broke out when Speaker Liang Su-yung of the
Nationalists tried to end a filibuster by Democratic Progressive
legislators by calling for a vote on government bills on the
employment and salaries for civil servants.
   Opposition members shouted protests and legislator Wei Yao-chien
rushed to the podium and tore out microphones.
   Liang called in about 100 police, but other Democratic
Progressive legislators joined the fray. Some butted heads against
policemen's chests trying to get to the podium and legislator Peng
Pai-hsien fought a policeman.
   Order was restored after more than an hour and the bills were
passed. The government wanted passage now so civil servants can get
annual bonuses.
   The Democratic Progressives are trying to force the government
to grant amnesty to opposition leader Huang Hwa, 51, sentenced to
10 years' imprisonment this month for advocating Taiwan's
independence from China.
   Both the Nationalists and China's Communist government oppose an
independent Taiwan, which they regard as a Chinese province.
   The Nationalists, who lost a civil war in China in 1949,
continue to claim they are the legitimate government of all China.

   Public television station KCET on Tuesday
renewed ``South Africa Now,'' a news magazine whose recent
cancellation generated protests.
   The renewal announcement came one day after a conservative media
watchdog group, which had claimed credit for the show's
cancellation, asked the Federal Communications Commission to yank
KCET's license.
   The Committee on Media Integrity filed a petition Monday with
the FCC requesting that KCET's license not be renewed and that a
KCET request for a new transmitter also be denied.
   William Kobin, KCET president and chief executive officer,
called the group's demands preposterous.
   David Horowitz, a spokesman for the conservative group, said the
petition would be withdrawn if the Public Broadcasting System
station establishes an elected board of directors and hires an
ombudsman.
   Kobin said the group's requests were part of a longstanding
effort to control the station's programming.
   ``These charges and demands are preposterous, and are clearly an
attempt to use the processes of the FCC to further their private
interests, certainly not those of the general public,'' Kobin said
in a prepared statement.
   ``South Africa Now'' was originally canceled in October after
KCET judged it did not meet journalistic standards for objectivity.
The news show, presented from a black perspective, was temporarily
renewed for six episodes.
   Tuesday's statement announcing the show's longterm renewal said
the station would continue to air the show in its 9 a.m. Sunday
time slot, but with a disclaimer identifying it as a ``point of
view'' series, the station said.

   Parliament adjourned in an uproar

   The bill calls for reducting the amount of rice purchased by the

Democratic Liberal Party, which controls the 299-member National
Assembly.
   Opposition lawmakers accused the government party of railroading
the bill.
   Shouting deputies from the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy rushed toward the podium as House Speaker Park Jyun-kyu
read the bill. They tried to push and shove governing party members
out of the way.
   One opposition lawmaker slapped a parliamentary staff member,
news accounts said. Another grabbed the hair of a governing party
deputy, newspapers said.
   The bill provides for a 29 percent cut in the amount of
government- purchased rice.
   Many opposition legislators represent rural areas and say
farmers cannot make a living with rising costs.

<HEAD>Judge Will Not Help Prosecutors Bring Cheyenne Brando Back from
Tahiti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday refused to summon
Marlon Brando's daughter from Tahiti to testify in the trial of her
brother, who is charged in the slaying of her former fiance.
   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter said he didn't have the
authority to issue an international subpoena, which could help
prosecutors force Cheyenne Brando to return to Los Angeles.
   Hatter said he would be ``creating new law'' with such an action
and could not do anything until Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof
asks Tahitian authorities to assist prosecutors.
   Rudof had not yet decided whether to seek Tahiti's help. He was
expected to make that decision Friday.
   Prosecutors say Miss Brando is a key witness in the case against
her half-brother, Christian, 32, who is accused of shooting her
Tahitian boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26.
   Miss Brando, 20, was seven months pregnant with Drollet's child
when Drollet was killed in Marlon Brando's mansion May 16. A month
later, she left for Tahiti, where she gave birth to a son.
   Miss Brando, who reportedly made two suicide attempts in
November, was hospitalized for emotional distress and has since
been placed under her mother's care.
   Prosecutors wanted to know if French Polynesian authorities
would allow Cheyenne to travel to the United States before the Jan.
14 trial date. She is being held as an accessory in the death of
Drollet, a French citizen.
   ``To be quite honest, we're almost out of time in this case,''
said Deputy District Attorney Steve Barshop.
   Miss Brando's attorney protested the request.
   ``She is a mentally ill person, she cannot proceed and yet the
district attorney has insisted on hounding her,'' said the lawyer,
Michael Nasatir.
   Deputy District Attorney William Clark said Miss Brando has
indicated she would testify if she could.
   ``She is a victim in this case,'' Clark said. ``She lost her
lover, she lost the father of her child.''
   A month after Drollet's death, Miss Brando told police she
believed the killing was premeditated. Christian Brando claimed it
was an accident. Miss Brando has given police several versions of
events regarding the slaying.

   A college student who gave birth in a
dormitory bathroom was charged with manslaughter for allegedly
suffocating the newborn by stuffing toilet paper down his throat,
police said.
   Stephanie Wernick, 20, of West Orange, N.J., was arraigned
Tuesday at her bedside at Nassau County Medical Center.
   Police said Wernick gave birth to a boy Monday in the bathroom
on the campus of C.W. Post College.
   Detective Sgt. Robert Edwards said Wernick concealed her
pregnancy from family and friends.
   The baby was placed in a plastic bag and dropped in a trash can
down the hall from Wernick's dormitory room after toilet paper was
stuffed down his throat, Edwards said.
   Police said Wernick returned to her room and passed out from
loss of blood.
   The 4-pound 12-ounce infant, born about one month premature, was
found by a janitor as he emptied garbage cans.
   Several girls in the dorm led detectives to Wernick after
telling police of her suspected pregnancy. She was found asleep in
her room and taken by ambulance to the hospital, where she was
listed in satisfactory condition.
   Wernick was arraigned on a charge of first degree manslaughter,
but no plea was entered. Her attorney, Stephen Scaring, said her
family intends to post her $5,000 bail when she is released from
the medical center.
   ``It appears that there was no intentional criminal activity,''
Scaring said. ``It's unfortunate the case has received so much
attention in the press.''

<TEXT>
   The leader of one of the West's largest communist
groups Tuesday proposed an international conference to help
redefine communism and overcome its troubles since the collapse of
East Bloc regimes.
   Georges Marchais opened the five-day French Communists' national
congress by proposing a talks between ``revolutionary parties'' to
help give communism a ``a second wind.''
   But he also promised support to the Soviet Union as it struggles
with Western-style reforms.
   Marchais ruled out any resumption of cooperation with the
governing Socialists, saying President Francois Mitterrand has
forsaken the left and implemeneted ``the policies sought by big
money, the policies of the right.''
   Marchais, in a nearly four-hour speech to more than 1,700
delegates, said his party had been a longstanding advocate of
reform in Eastern Europe, but had underestimated the extent of the
crisis faced by the toppled Communist regimes there.
   ``With us, there was shortcoming of analysis and
understanding,'' he said.
   The French Communist Party claims 600,000 members and holds 26
of 577 seats in the National Assembly. Communists control municipal
councils in 1,097 communities, including dozens of working-class
suburbs around major cities, but their support in recent national
elections has dropped below 10 percent.
   The party congresses, held every three years, are the
highest-level forum for choosing leadership and setting policy.
   This one marks the 70th anniversary of the party's founding and
was the first since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.
   The French Communists envisioned a society ``completely
different from the socialist societies that exist now or used to
exist,'' he said.
   Referring to the Soviet Union, Marchais said the situation there
is ``far from attractive.'' He also criticized the Soviets'
decision to authorize use of force against Iraq in the Persian Gulf
crisis, saying this move ``deeply disappointed the people of
France.''
   ``This war cannot be our war,'' he said.
   Marchais, however, expressed empathy for Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform initiatives.
   Marchais defended his party's decision to invite a Chinese
delegation to the congress, but reiterated his denunciation of
``the murderous repression'' against pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing last year.
   Marchais is heavily favored to win re-election as party leader.

   Nineteen protesters were arrested
Tuesday after trying to reach the hospital room of Nancy Cruzan,
who was disconnected from her feeding tube last week in a landmark
right-to-die case.
   The protesters clutched rosaries and Bibles as they were pushed
from the Missouri Rehabilitation Center in wheelchairs and taken to
jail on charges of trespassing and unlawful assembly.
   The 19 people arrested were among about 25 protesters who showed
up at the hospital Tuesday morning. At least 11 made it to the
second floor. They were stopped by a small army of police officers
from getting to Ms. Cruzan's private room. They knelt and prayed in
the hallway before being dragged off the floor.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a persistent vegetative state since
a 1983 car accident. A judge granted her parents, Joe and Joyce
Cruzan, permission Friday to disconnect her feeding tube.
   Doctors predict she will die in six days to two weeks.
   Ms. Cruzan was the subject of the U.S. Supreme Court's first
right-to-die decision in June when the court blocked her parents
from halting food and water in the absence of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence she would want to die.
   The parents later presented to a state court testimony from
co-workers who recalled Ms. Cruzan saying she would never want to
live ``like a vegetable.''
   The Rev. Ted Coleman, hospital chaplain, said the Cruzans were
with their daughter when some protesters reached the second floor.
   ``They said they were aware. They said, `We're private people.
We just want to be left alone,' '' Coleman said.
   The Rev. Joseph Foreman of Montreat, N.C., director of Prisoners
of Christ, which he described as a pro-life group, was among the
protesters arrested.
   If he could meet the Cruzans, Foreman said, ``I would plead with
them that for whatever reason they won't feed their daughter, there
are many, many people who are volunteering to care for her. Be
merciful and let them do it.''
   ``She's going to be dead soon if someone doesn't intervene,''
Foreman said. ``Citizens have got to stop standing by silently and
letting people die.''
   One of the protesters carried a cup of water he said he wanted
to take to Ms. Cruzan.
   ``If you're going to kill her, just put a pillow over her
head,'' said the protester, who identified himself as Gary Tebbets
of Kansas City.
   A state appeals court rejected without comment a petition from
Tebbets and Gary Rickman that Ms. Cruzan's food and water
immediately be restored.
   Don Lamkins, the hospital director, initially said the
protesters could stay in the first-floor chapel and in the
stairwell. But he later decided to have them arrested after talking
with police.
   ``They were blocking the fire exit and essentially the
hallway,'' Lamkins said. ``They wouldn't talk to us. They wouldn't
move. And they indicated they were staying because they wanted to
be arrested.''
   The protesters were held on a standard $500 bond on each count.
   Lt. Ken Perkins, the chief jailer for Lawrence County, said the
protesters were fasting and all claiming to be Nancy Cruzan,
refusing to give their real names.
   ``They can't make bail until we get their names. They are all
Nancy Cruzans right now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Says Captain of Dredge Was Negligent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of the barge that broke loose
from its moorings and slammed into a bridge in October may have
been negligent because he failed to drop a second anchor, the U.S.
Coast Guard said Tuesday.
   The barge knocked out a 370-foot section of the Herbert C.
Bonner Bridge, the only link between Hatteras Island and the
mainland, on Oct. 26, stranding thousands of residents and
tourists.
   State transportation officials say the bridge will be out at
least until the end of January. A ferry now shuttles people and
cars from the island to Wanchese, on the mainland, but service is
intermittent.
   The Coast Guard said unexpected rough weather drove the barge, a
dredge called Northerly Island, from its moorings and was the cause
of the accident.
   But the barge captain apparently contributed to the accident
because he failed to use the dredge's second anchor after the
vessel became grounded about 250 feet from the bridge, the Coast
Guard said in a statement from its office in Portsmouth, Va.
   In its report, the Coast Guard said the barge's captain, William
Cliett, chose to try to free the vessel rather than secure it with
a second anchor.
   ``Under the circumstances, it would have been prudent to use all
means available and a second anchor may have added sufficient
holding power to prevent the (accident). The master's failure to
use the second anchor constitutes evidence of negligence on his
part,'' the Coast Guard statement said.
   Cliett, who lives in Savannah, Ga., has an unlisted telephone
number and could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.
   He told investigators previously that he didn't think a second
anchor would have prevented the dredge from drifting toward the
bridge.

<TEXT>
   Carnation Co. will begin advertising
Good Start baby formula directly to mothers next month, joining
Gerber Products in a strategy opposed by the American Academy of
Pediatricians.
   The academy and other health organizations maintain such ads may
discourage mothers from breast-feeding. They support only ads
directed at doctors, who in turn recommend products to nursing
mothers.
   ``We have certainly opposed (consumer ads) with the Gerber
formula and would oppose it with the Carnation formula,'' said
Denver pediatrician James E. Strain, the academy's executive
director.
   Carnation President Timm Crull said the move is necessary to
compete with the giants of the infant formula industry, Abbott
Laboratories' Similac and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Enfamil, which
dominate the $1.5 billion yearly business.
   In November 1988, Carnation introduced its Good Start formula
for younger infants and Good Nature, for infants who have begun to
eat solid foods.
   Crull said the pediatric academy guidelines banning consumer
advertising benefit the Abbott-Bristol-Myers ``oligarchy'' at the
expense of new competitors.
   The Federal Trade Commission is investigating possible unfair
competitive practices by the infant food industry, including a
review of the voluntary ban on consumer ads.
   Carnation is a Glendale-based unit of the Swiss foods giant
Nestle, which was the object of a worldwide boycott over formula
marketing practices in Third World countries.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Robert P. Casey on Tuesday signed the
``potty parity'' bill to help cut long lines women endure when
using public restrooms.
   New public buildings and those undergoing extensive renovation
will have to include sufficient restrooms for women.
   The law applies to buildings leased or owned by the state and
certain other public facilities.
   The law, which takes effect in four months, leaves it to the
Department of Labor and Industry to determine how many more toilets
are required for women than for men. The law doesn't apply to
hotels and restaurants.
   Supporters said the shortage of restrooms for women force them
to stand in long lines at concerts, sporting events and other
recreational activities.
   Rep. Ruth Rudy, D-Centre, a sponsor of the bill, said it was a
step forward for women.
   ``I'm very pleased that we finally achieved something for women
in the commonwealth,'' she said. ``I'm hoping that it will lead to
fewer lines at women's restrooms, even though it's going to be a
long, drawn-out process.''
   The law requires the added women's toilets in renovations of 50
percent or more of a building, but Ms. Rudy said she hoped owners
of buildings undergoing less extensive renovation will add more
women's restrooms anyway.

   More than 50,000 students marched through
the capital on Tuesday demanding that the education minister resign
and asking repeal of new rules that include punishment for
classroom absences and sloppy dressing.
   Riot squads used tear gas to disperse about 200 people who set
fires and attacked officers outside Athens Polytechnic University.
   A police spokesman said no one was hurt or arrested and that no
students were involved in the clashes.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   High school students complain that new education regulations are
vague about discipline, fail to outline teaching methods and do not
explain the grading system. They are want the government to spend
more money on education.
   University students oppose a proposal to allow private
universities, now banned by the constitution.
   Education Minister Vasillis Kontoyannopoulos said Monday the
rules will not be enforced, but the students still want the
legislation scrapped.
   Teen-agers have taken over more than 2,000 high schools. Several
students who stormed the Education Ministry building last week were
injured when police fired tear gas into a crowd.

   Danny Ray Harris won a stay late
Tuesday just hours before his scheduled execution for the slaying
12 years ago of a man who stopped to help him and his brother when
their car broke down.
   Harris faced lethal injection for the killing of Timothy Michael
Berka, a Texas A&amp;M University employee who was fatally beaten with
a tire iron in what became known as the ``Samaritan'' slaying.
   Harris received a stay from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in
New Orleans. Earlier in the day, a state appeals court and a
federal judge rejected requests to delay his execution.
   Assistant Texas Attorney General Bob Walt had said the state
would not oppose requests for a stay.
   Testimony showed Danny Harris, 30, devised the plan to kill
Merka so the brothers and their companions could steal Merka's
pickup truck. Witnesses said he held down Merka while his brother
beat him with a tire iron.
   Harris' brother, Curtis Paul Harris, also was sentenced to
death.
   One of their companions, James Manuel, received a 25-year prison
term. The other, Valarie Rencher, testified against the Harris
brothers and received no prison time.
   No date has been set for Curtis Harris' execution.
   The federal appeals court issued the stay at 9:45 p.m. Danny
Harris had faced lethal injection shortly after midnight.
   He said in a recent interview that his death would not make up
for Merka's death and would not achieve justice.
   ``What justice is there in that?'' Harris said, speaking about
his execution. ``Is it taking one life for another life?''
   Harris would be the fifth Texas inmate put to death this year
and the 38th since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982.
The total is the highest in the nation among states with the death
penalty.
   It would be the 144th execution in the United States since the
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the
death penalty.

   WASHINGTON - President Bush says a mandate for using military
force against Iraq must be fulfilled ``right on schedule'' unless
Saddam Hussein meets a Jan. 15 deadline to withdraw all his troops
from Kuwait.
   Bush said the Iraqi leader apparently doubts that the United
States will use force, and believes instead that this country is
too divided to stand behind military action.
   ``And he's just as wrong as he can be,'' the president told
reporters Monday.
   Bush went out of his way to intensify pressure on Saddam to back
down in the face of a massive - and still growing - military force
aligned against him in the Persian Gulf.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - Today's ``volunteer'' Army is looking for more than
volunteers.
   For the first time in nearly three decades, the Army is
searching out military retirees - especially those with medical
skills - and forcing them back into uniform.
   As the buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf surges toward
the 400,000 level and the United Nations deadline nears for an
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the Army is digging deep into its
personnel records for help in supporting the force.
   Lt. Col. Henry H. Hanrahan, an Army planner, said Monday that an
initial callup of 15 retired physician assistants was approved last
week, and about 200 other retirees probably would be involuntarily
recalled for active duty over the next month.
   ---&equals;
   SAN FRANCISCO - The nation's toughest law protecting users of
video display terminals was sent to Mayor Art Agnos after winning
approval from city supervisors, who called it cutting-edge
legislation for a high-tech age.
   Union leaders and victims of VDT-related injuries cheered when
the ordinance was approved 7-4 Monday. The Board of Supervisors
approved it 8-1 in a preliminary vote last week.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Becky Hogue, a Pacific Bell operator who
wears plastic splints on her wrists because of weakness from years
of using computer keyboards. ``I suffered so much, but now maybe
others won't have to go through the same pain.''
   The Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure, saying its high
costs would drive businesses away.
   The mayor has not said whether he will accept it. He supports
the spirit of the measure, he says, but has misgivings about its
cost.
   ---&equals;
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Lamar Alexander, a former governor and
president of the University of Tennessee, may well be the man who
can make George Bush the education president, say those who know
him.
   Even detractors of his reform programs credit Alexander with
generating interest in improving public schools and higher
education in Tennessee, where as many as one in five adults is
functionally illiterate.
   Bush on Monday nominated Alexander, a 50-year-old lawyer and son
of teachers, as education secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, he
would succeed Lauro Cavazos, who was forced to resign last week.
   ``No governor in the country is so clearly identified with the
imperative to improve education in America,'' the president said.
He said the former two-term governor was ``at the forefront of the
movement to restructure our nation's schools.''
   ---&equals;
   JERUSALEM - For nearly three years, the Palestinian uprising
consisted mainly of street battles in the occupied territories, a
war of stones far removed from most Israelis' daily lives.
   But a series of fatal stabbings on the streets of Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem has brought the Arab revolt closer to home.
   Growing fear among Israelis has prompted calls for harsh
punishment of Arabs who attack Jews. It also has renewed debate
over whether Israel should continue to occupy the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The independent Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth called this
week for a solution ``based on physical separation between us and
the Palestinians.''
   ---&equals;
   VIENNA, Austria - Stalinist Albania seems to have taken a giant
step by permitting its first non-Communist party, but many emigres
and others are skeptical the change is genuine or sufficient to
contain popular anger.
   Caught between a reluctance to relinquish a 46-year monopoly on
power and a desire to avoid mass violence, the Communist leadership
has sent a series of contradictory signals in the past week.
   President Ramiz Alia, who a month ago denied any need for
competing political parties, has now pledged that reform is
irreversible.
   Yet his government has to date kept all but a handful of foreign
journalists from reporting independently on the historic events in
his land. It has also so far failed to accord the new Democratic
Party of Albania legality.
   ---&equals;
   NEW DELHI, India - Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar suggests that
hidden hands are manipulating the frenzied religious riots ravaging
India and has threatened to use a heavy dose of force to end the
fighting.
   ``Any amount of force that is needed will be used in order to
stop this situation,'' he said Monday in an interview with The
Associated Press at the official residence. ``There's no limit.''
   At least 300 people have been killed in fighting between the
Hindu majority and Moslems in the past 10 days. Another 300 people
died in rioting in October and November.
   The ferocity of the violence has little parallel since the
slaughters that accompanied the 1947 division of the British-ruled
subcontinent into predominantly Hindu India and mostly Islamic
Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   It started sometime last week, America; the
first few salvos of the television onslaught that has become a
yuletide ritual: the annual ``It's a Wonderful Life'' marathon.
   There's no way to count how many times director Frank Capra's
1946 classic will reach television sets this holiday season,
whether by terrestrial broadcast, satellite, coaxial cable,
videocassette or laserdisc.
   It's 129 minutes of classic Americana: Boy finds savings and
loan; boy loses savings and loan; taxpayers bail out boy, saving
the savings and loan.
   Why do we like it so much?
   How could we NOT like it? We're Americans!
   As in previous years, the Fear, Greed &amp; Power Incarnate cable
system plans to air the movie continuously from 6 p.m. tonight to
midnight Dec. 25.
   ``Naturally, we expect some viewer burnout,'' said one FG&amp;PI
publicist, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But, hey, we're
giving them what they want. And want. And want.''
   FG&amp;PI will air the original black and white version, the
colorized version where Donna Reed's graduation party dress is
yellow, and the OTHER colorized version where the dress is blue.
   Then they'll show the descriptive narrative version for the
vision impaired. (``George looks down into the torrent, a
world-weary pain settles across his face. Above him, Clarence
jumps. George dives in after him.'')
   And, in a final mind-boggler, FG&amp;PI will air the aberrant 1977
made-for-TV remake, ``It Happened One Christmas,'' starring Marlo
Thomas as a kind of ``Georgina Bailey,'' co-starring Cloris
Leachman and Wayne Rogers.
   Other, less-imaginary cable operators are reducing their
exposure of ``It's a Wonderful Life'' this season, possibly fearing
just the ``viewer burnout'' that four viewings in as many days can
induce.
   So why do we like this film so much?
   ``It's a Wonderful Life'' is the dark, haunting story of a
decent man named George Bailey, who dreams of building skyscrapers
and mile-long bridges once he flees his hometown, Bedford Falls,
N.Y., where his father runs the local S&amp;L.
   Then Life happens: His father's death forces George to shelve
his dreams and run the S&amp;L; he marries; settles down and scrapes
along, his dreams getting dustier, until he is financially ruined
by a drastic reverse on Christmas Eve.
   Then, in a frightening outburst of neurotic rage, he curses his
life, wishes he were never born and stands on a bridge at a river,
contemplating suicide.
   Enter the angel, Clarence, sent from above to thwart his
suicide. He grants George his wish: A nightmare vision of Bedford
Falls transformed into a sleazy nighttown of alienated hard cases
who don't even recognize George Bailey.
   George, sweaty, panicked, eyes rolling like a crazed horse's,
finally understands the influence that one good man has on the
world. He begs to be restored to his life and his family and,
miraculously, he is. All ends well.
   Yes, but why do we like it so much? ``Capra-corn'' was what the
director's sneering contemporaries called his movies' wholehearted
embrace of American values: home, church, community. This is the
'90s, man!
   The movie opened Dec. 20, 1946, was nominated for five Academy
Awards and, against ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' won none. It
broke even at the box office - some said the suicide was
off-putting - and lapsed into obscurity.
   So why do we like it today?
   ``We like it because it's free,'' said one television executive,
speaking on condition that he be fictional.
   In 1974, you see, someone forgot to renew the film's copyright.
It went into the public domain. That meant that any station,
anywhere, could air the film as many times as it cared to, without
paying a thin dime. They did.
   That's why the TV stations showed it to us all these years. That
it happens to be good cinema is just our luck. Awful ``colorized''
versions of the film can be copyrighted, but the classic black and
white is still anybody's game.
   Yes, but what is there about this film that would prompt, say,
an exotic dancer to take the stage name Zuzu Petals?
   ``It's a Wonderful Life'' is probably one of James Stewart's
greatest films. It is a comedy masking as a drama - or perhaps the
reverse. It is full of magic, angelic behavior and good feelings.
And, worse, it's a unabashedly sentimental treatment of many
aspects of love.
   It celebrates the love of family, of wife and husband, of parent
and child, the love of country, love of community. It is exalts of
basic virtues: that nice guys don't finish last and that life is,
indeed, worth living.
   Take that away and, yes, it's just another movie. Get out your
handkerchiefs and tune in FG&amp;IP, now playing in your neighborhood.
   Zuzu Petals???

<HEAD>New York's Cosmopolitan Cab Fleet Adopts Tougher Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cab driver Claude Jacques learned English and
his way around New York at the same time.
   ``One time this guy asked to go to `The Garden,''' said Jacques,
who arrived from Haiti 10 years ago. ``I start going to Central
Park. The guy screams, `Madison Square Garden, man.' No tip from
him.''
   But those were more free-wheeling days. Now before new cabbies
hit the streets, there are classes to take and tests to pass.
   With the city's cab fleet becoming increasingly international -
91 nations and at least 72 languages represented among drivers at
last count - officials have made the license requirements more
challenging in an attempt to improve service and stem passengers'
complaints.
   On Nov. 1, the English language test was made more rigorous to
simulate real-life conversations. The mandatory 40-hour course has
been expanded to include city tours and geography lessons.
   The final exam, enlarged nearly threefold since the mid-1980s,
now covers questions on how to maneuver through obscure
neighborhoods and the channels of city bureaucacy. The failure rate
is now close to 40 percent, up from about 10 percent before the
revisions.
   ``We're dealing with the whole city here,'' said Jack Lusk,
chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission. ``Without
standards, it would be crazy.''
   Of the 40,000 licensed cabbies in New York in 1984, two-thirds
were born outside the United States, according to a taxi commission
study. The percentage is likely close to 85 percent now, some
experts say.
   Lusk said the changes were made, in part, to halt criticism that
cabbies did not know enough of the city or failed to fully
understand English-speaking riders.
   ``The image of the New York cabbie as the cigar-chomping
philosopher who talks about sports and politics is way out of
date,'' said Paul Herzich, a director at Federated Employment &amp;
Guidance Service, which operates the taxi commission's two training
schools. ``They're an endangered species.''
   About 6,000 applicants a year pass the English test and enroll
in the two schools. An American-born student is an oddity, said
Herzich.
   One recent taxi school class included three Haitians, two
Pakistanis, two Egyptians and a Moroccan.
   ``OK, who can tell me what famous buildings in on East End
Avenue?'' asked teacher Bob Schneider, a former cab driver.
   The students flip through their maps of upper Manhattan.
Schneider didn't wait for an answer.
   ``Gracie Mansion, the mayor's house,'' he said. ``By the way,
you can always pick up good fares there at night.''
   Jean Bruny, a 32-year-old Haitian, jotted down the tip. He lost
his job when the machine factory were he worked relocated to
Pennsylvania.
   ``Hey, I need work and I need money,'' Bruny said. ``If I pass
the test, I'm on the road. I'm my own boss.''
   With the U.S. economy apparently recession-bound, some cab
industry experts foresee a return of some native New York drivers.
These days, a full-time driver can bring home up to $600 a week.
   ``The taxi drivers are like a barometer of political, economic
and social unheavals,'' said Anne Morris, director of the Center
for Logistics and Transportation at the City University of New York
Graduate Center.
   ``It seems the tougher the times in a country, the more we see
immigrants from those countries looking to become cabbies.''
   Presently, there is an influx of drivers from Pakistan, India
and other Asian countries with high unemployment and struggling
economies, said Ms. Morris, who has tracked the city's cab industry
since the early 1980s. Before the fall of Haitian dicator
Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986, Haitian cabbies dominated the
newcomers.
   ``For many, driving a cab is the first step toward the American
dream,'' she said. ``It's a modern immigrants' story.''
   She said the Persian Gulf crisis could lead to a rise in cabbie
applicants from Yemenis, Filipinos and other others who fled jobs
in Kuwait.
   But life behind the wheel in New York is not easy, said Lusk.
Twenty-one percent of the cabbie don't renew their license after
the first year - some worn out by the long hours or moving on to
other professions.
   The taxi commission says more than 40 percent of the
foreign-born cabbies have at least two years of college.
   Sherman Appel is a hallmark to cabbie longevity. For 32 years,
he has cruised the streets of his native city. Above his cab's
visor, he keeps a copy of a creased Daily News article on New York
high school graduates who went onto fame.
   The foreign cabbies remind him of his parents, Russian Jews who
emigrated just after the turn of the century.
   ``Years ago, you came to this country and worked in a factory,''
he said. ``Now, they come and drive a cab - different time,
different jobs.''

<HEAD>Caution and Luck Are Keys to Newsman's Survival in Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By O.C. DOELLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Fisk, one of the last Western journalists
left in the cauldron of Beirut, believes ``quite a lot could have
stayed - if done with great caution and care.''
   But, as Fisk's just-published book makes clear, luck and
instinct are equally important for a risk-taker's survival in the
killing fields of Lebanon: The braking of a car just before a round
explodes in its path; the precious inches separating the quick and
the dead during an artillery barrage or car bombing; the fortuitous
intervention of an outsider in the midst of trigger-happy gunmen.
   ``Pity the Nation,'' published by Atheneum, relates in often
gory detail the near-misses, fear and horror Fisk experienced and
witnessed during his 14 years of covering civil war, two Israeli
invasions, the massacre at the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps and
bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Lebanon.
   The book is subtitled ``The Abduction of Lebanon'' - an allusion
to repeated, disastrous foreign interventions in the ancient Land
of Cedars, whose revenge was ``to welcome all her invaders and kiss
them to death.''
   A reviewer of the book's British edition who had followed Fisk's
adventurous reportage for The Times of London and later The
Independent confessed, ``I am amazed to see ... that he is still
alive and writing.''
   The 44-year-old British correspondent says the book was inspired
in part by his friend and colleague Terry Anderson, The Associated
Press Middle East correspondent who was kidnapped on a west Beirut
street in March 1985. Anderson, the longest held of 13 Western
hostages in Lebanon, ``paid the price for staying on the story,''
Fisk wrote.
   Fisk stayed because he too felt a commitment to a protracted,
violent story which ``you can't cover long range.''
   Anderson's dignified behavior in captivity ``has done nothing
but enhance the standing of journalists,'' Fisk said in an
interview. ``I hear nothing bad said about Terry (in Beirut).''
   Fisk himself narrowly averted abducion by gunmen a year earlier
after a ``French Connection-like'' car chase through the darkened
streets of west Beirut.
   In his book, Fisk writes that Anderson's kidnappers were not the
``faceless terrorists'' the Reagan administration professed them to
be.
   ``His principal captor was so well known that American agents
tried to arrest him near Paris when he was on holiday in France.
The French, mindful of their own hostages, forced the Americans to
leave him alone,'' Fisk wrote.
   Western intelligence agencies have fingered Imad Mughniyeh,
leader of the Islamic Jihad, as the probable mastermind behind
scores of kidnappings, including that of Anderson. Mughniyeh is
wanted by the United States in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner
in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Fisk's book is critical of the low-profile approach taken by The
Associated Press in the immediate aftermath of Anderson's
kidnapping. Fisk favored a direct, personal appeal for aid to
Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose troops control a wide area of
Lebanon.
   Anderson's kidnapping prompted most Western news organizations
to withdraw their American and European staffers from Beirut. Fisk
and his wife, Lara Marlowe of the Financial Times, wound up as the
last Western correspondents living in Moslem west Beirut.
   Toward the end of the book, Fisk writes: ``It seemed that
Lebanon had become an epic of lost souls, of missing men and women,
people who had disappeared, had been arrested and not returned,
kidnapped, tortured, dead.''
   Nearly six years after Anderson's kidnapping, Fisk reports,
``the traditional respect for journalists as impartial observers is
not dead, though critically damaged'' in Lebanon.
   But he sees signs of hope now that Moslem and Christian militia
men are withdrawing from Beirut. ``Some areas are safer than a year
ago. At the moment it has gotten a lot less worrisome to report if
they (the Lebanese combatants) are sure of your good intentions,''
Fisk said.
   Fisk's reporting from the Arab side of the Middle East conflict
has led some Israeli officials and supporters to challenge Fisk's
good intentions and objectivity. Israeli President Chaim Herzog is
quoted in the book as telling his Irish counterpart, Garret
FirzGerland, in 1985 that Fisk was a ``virulent hater of Israel.''
Fisk was then also writing for the Irish Times.
   ``All journalists who work in the Arab world are forced to
report what they see,'' Fisk said. ``If Israeli air raids killed
women and children, it was our duty to report it. You cannot change
the rules and integrity of your profession if you happen to report
on Israel in an Arab country.''
   While the bulk of the book deals critically with the 1982
Israeli invasion of Lebanon and its bitter consequences, Fisk also
disapproves of the conduct of the Palestinians, the Syrians, the
various Lebanese militias and the United States. U.S. troops, who
came as peacekeepers and left as combatants, were withdrawn from
Beirut after the 1983 truckbombing of the U.S. Marine barracks
killed 241 Americans.
   Fisk sees some parallels between American entanglement in the
Lebanese conflict and their present buildup in the Persian Gulf.
Fisk refers in the book to ``the American `one-two-three' school of
politics which we in Beirut so derided - military action followed
by political aims followed by a `solution.'''
   The Gulf buildup, he said, ``involves the same illusion - the
notion that the United States can remain Israel's best friend and
still be the honest broker in the Middle East.''

<TEXT>
   As you might expect, those involved in real
estate in its many forms are searching for answers, wondering what
happened and looking for flickers of hope.
   There is grim reality, for example, as expressed by Douglas
Tibbetts, president of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management
Inc. in Atlanta, Ga.
   ``The days of self-delusion are gone,'' says Tibbetts. ``Any
thought of a soft landing in real estate is gone as well.
   ``We are in a cleansing stage, like in a washing machine. This
is the hot water wash now. Then we'll rinse out a lot of the people
in the industry and take a tossing and tumbling for a while in the
spin dry cycle.
   ``We'll all be a little more worn when we come out.''
   There is despair about the immediate future. Let Michael
Sumichrast, publisher and editor of the ``Sumichrast Report,'' a
newsletter for housing executives, tell you about it:
   ``I cannot find many compelling reasons to believe the recession
will be a short one. The current quarter will be the first to see
minus growth. It is hard to imagine the first or second quarter of
1991 will perform any better.
   ``Lowering interest rates is clearly a good move, but 50 basis
points are not going to make much difference. There is very little
the administration, burdened with so much debt, can do to stimulate
the economy ...
   ``The S&amp;L crisis will take several years to settle. Add to this
the problems with the banks and other financial intermediaries, and
we will be in a financial squeeze for some time ...''
   But there is hope, too. An article in ``Realtor News,'' a weekly
publication of the National Association of Realtors, tells why. It
begins this way:
   ``Lower mortgage interest rates could be a key factor that sets
the national single-family home sales rate back on an upward path
this coming spring, presaging a decade of healthy growth ...''
   It cites forecasts by three economists who monitor the housing
industry.
   Roger Brinner, chief economist for the McGraw-Hill Financial
Services Co., sees strong housing markets for the remainder of the
1990s. ``Housing is going to be a growth industry,'' he said.
   Mortgage rates will fall, said John Tuccillo, the NAR's own
economist. And Barbara Allen, a housing analyst for Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co., the investment firm, said the baby boomers will remain a
strong force in the market.
   Why, there may even be more than hope. There might be
opportunity in the midst of the gloom, not sometime in the future
but now, ready to be pounced upon by aggressive investors. And not
just good opportunities, but perhaps better than have been seen in
a decade.
   Richard Grillo, an international real estate investment adviser
and partner in the New York firm of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith,
presents this view:
   ``For those American real estate companies willing to accept the
challenge, Europe offers a window of opportunity that won't be open
long. Most appealing are yields on prime, investment-grade real
estate in the United Kingdom ...
   ``In practice, a mixed U.K. portfolio with suitably staggered
rent review patterns should provide U.S. investors with a
combination of stability and capital growth unheard of in the U.S.
over the last 10 years.''
   No, you can't keep them down long, the real estate buyers,
sellers, developers and financiers. In fact, the fundamental real
estate problem may be to constrain the enthusiasm of participants.
   That enthusiasm gets them into trouble. They just love to hear
the tumble and grind of the concrete mixer at a new building site,
and because they do they often end up in the washing machine
instead, tumbled about and spun dry.

<HEAD>Remodeling at Any House, Especially the White House, Can Be Messy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among in-house White House headaches, a
reversed ruling against minority scholarships is likely to prove
more troublesome for President Bush than the embarrassment of
naming a Republican Party chairman who quit before taking the job.
   Both episodes point to disarray in an administration undergoing
some second-year remodeling. Both were the sort of surprises
presidents do not like. Both came in areas where the White House
already had problems - civil rights and political management.
   Bush got no warning and there was no consultation with his top
aides before an assistant education secretary ruled that
scholarships reserved for blacks and other minorities were out of
bounds at colleges and universities that receive federal funds. The
same official overhauled his ruling on Tuesday at White House
insistence. The new version permits such scholarships so long as
they are privately financed.
   Bush said he didn't think it was a flip-flop.
   There was a flip-flop though - the politically awkward exit of
William J. Bennett, two weeks after Bush announced he wanted the
former drug policy boss to become chairman of the Republican
National Committee.
   Bennett withdrew on Dec. 13, saying a second reading by the
White House lawyer raised doubt that he could properly accept
speechmaking and consulting fees during the next year if he took
the job.
   It was his old government job, not the party position, that
posed the problem. Federal ethics law forbids former federal
officials from lobbying their old colleagues on behalf of private
employers for a year after leaving office. In Bennett's case, that
could have been construed as applying to contacts he might have
made as party chairman on matters of interest to private
organizations that paid him for speeches.
   The party job pays $125,000 a year, and other chairman, in both
parties, have earned outside income to add to their salaries.
Bennett said the difference is that they came out of private life,
not executive branch jobs.
   Bennett made $240,000 in speech fees during the four months he
was out of the government, between tours as Ronald Reagan's
secretary of education and Bush's drug policy director. He also has
a book contract that paid him an advance of $187,500.
   His circumstances didn't change during the three weeks from
choice to announcement to withdrawal. ``The advice changed,''
Bennett said in withdrawing.
   A president ought to be able to count on better, more durable
advice than that when he chooses somebody for an appointment. The
Bennett affair drew taunts from Democrats and from conservative
Republicans as well.
   The conservatives first suspected that the choice of Bennett was
an attempt to control a voice that might have joined theirs in
dissent against Bush for what some of them say is a turn away from
Ronald Reagan's legacy. When he withdrew, they began suggesting
that Bennett had been pushed because he wasn't willing to take his
commands from John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
   ``John Sununu is a close friend of mine,'' Bennett said. ``He is
- and this is a message partly to my fellow conservatives - one of
the best and most longstanding conservatives in America.''
   Except as a political footnote, that chapter will close when the
Republican National Committee confirms Bush's backup choice for
chairman on Jan. 25.
   The scholarship issue may persist, although the administration
got it turned around before Congress convened recess hearings on
the subject. It may well come up again next year, when
congressional Democrats renew their drive for the civil rights bill
they could not push past a Bush veto this fall.
   The Democrats say the initial ruling against race-based
scholarships fits the pattern set in Republican administrations,
and they may write into their 1991 bill a provision to guarantee
that colleges and universities can reserve scholarships for blacks
and other minority students.
   Bush said he thinks the scholarship question eventually will be
settled by the courts. He said he might be open to legislation on
it. The president praised Michael J. Williams, assistant secretary
of education for civil rights, who issued the ruling and the
amendments. Williams, a black lawyer with a long record in civil
rights, said he had been naive not to anticipate the controversy.
   There's more of it coming.

<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Piles of garbage choke streets, drug
deals and murders are common, housing projects have been flooded
with raw sewage and weed-infested vacant lots checker the city.
   East St. Louis is a $47 million sinkhole, a city so burdened by
debt that some of its police cars lack tail lights and City Hall
was sold to pay a court judgment.
   To Mike Riddle, it's a place where houses fall down and nothing
comes back up.
   ``When they tear down a house, they don't put another one up,
and the weeds just take over. It's just rundown,'' said Riddle, a
school custodianand longtime resident.
   To Sandra Woods, it's a place so rough that cabbies won't come
when called, fear of crime makes for sleepless nights and her
grandchildren wait in the rain for school buses that don't run on
time.
   ``It's pitiful,'' she said.
   East St. Louis once was bustling with chemical, metal and glass
works. But labor troubles, crime and corruption in the 1960s led to
white flight. The population was 82,000 in 1960, but has shrunk to
40,000. Today, the city is virtually all black.
   The city's 63 slayings in 1989 gave it the highest per-capita
murder rate in the FBI's national rankings, and police say they are
overwhelmed by drug-related crime. Residents talk about their fears
of gang fights and drive-by shootings.
   Last year, East St. Louis' crumbling sewers flooded a school and
a housing project with raw sewage. The city in January was
convicted of reckless conduct for endangering police officers by
failing to outfit squad cars with working radios, head and tail
lights and other basics.
   East St. Louis has so little money that a judge awarded its $6
million City Hall building as a damage payment to a man who was
beaten in the city jail by another inmate. The beating victim has
sold the building to an undisclosed buyer, but the city is
appealing the damage award.
   In the poorest parts of town, drivers inch cars between
3-foot-high piles of trash that squeeze streets to one lane. Two
years ago, the city stopped picking up garbage, and people can't
pay anyone else to do it.
   Burned and abandoned downtown buildings are left to rot and
fall, within sight of the skyscrapers and Gateway Arch of more
prosperous St. Louis across the Mississippi River.
   Potholes create caverns in virtually every street, and on some
days the air stings with the smoke of burning tires dumped and
torched in vacant lots.
   There are bright spots: In some neighborhoods, the ranch-style
homes are lovingly maintained, with flower beds, manicured lawns
and freshly paved driveways.
   But bars over the windows tell of the city's dangers, and next
to a house that would fit in any middle-class suburb is a
dilapidated home with a junked car outside.
   Such contrasts are the legacy of those who refuse to leave and
those who can't.
   ``A lot of people stay here because they can't afford to go
anywhere else,'' said Russell Hudlin, president of the Chamber of
Commerce and owner of a gas station and convenience store.
   Others stay because the city offers familiarity, proximity to
jobs and shopping in St. Louis, and a thriving night life, Hudlin
said.
   Downtown East St. Louis' many bars offer rhythm and blues,
liquor and liveliness long after St. Louis clubs must close.
   Hudlin considers the night life a chance for municipal growth.
But the city cannot raise enough revenue to make improvements or
hire workers, despite having one of the highest property tax rates
in the state. Homeowners pay $9.50 for every $100 of assessed
value.
   Most major industries sit outside the city limits, providing no
tax base, and it's estimated that more than half of city residents
get government aid.
   In 1989, 13.2 percent of East St. Louis residents were without
work, not including the chronically unemployed or those on welfare,
according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security.
   City officials now pin their hopes on gambling and the state.
   East St. Louis has been chosen to receive one of five riverboat
gambling licenses in Illinois and, pending state approval of
private operators, officials hope to develop a riverboat port
within a few years.
   The city also expects $34 million in state loans, including $4
million for immediate needs such as police and firefighting
equipment, road repairs and garbage pickup. The rest will be used
for long-term improvements and debt consolidation.
   The entire sum, being raised by a state-backed bond issue, must
be repaid over several decades.
   The catch is that the mayor and Aldermanic Council must get
their annual budget approved by a state-appointed bailout
authority, and spending is monitored by an investment banking firm
working for the state.
   If the state doesn't like the budget, it can take control of
city finances and intercept bailout payments.
   The authority has been holding back a $3.75 million-loan
installment because the city missed the deadline to submit its 1991
budget. The Aldermanic Council this month finally approved a $5.7
million-budget at the demand of the authority.
   Last month, residents voted to have city officials hire a
professional city manager.
   ``On the whole, we are at ground zero and we can only go up,''
said Hudlin, the Chamber of Commerce head. ``You can only imagine
if we pay our debts and get back on our feet again what we can
do.''
   Riddle seemed to agree, as he stood across the street from a
vacant lot and abandoned building.
   ``I believe the people of East St. Louis don't give a hoot who
owns the city. They just want to see it improve,'' he said.
``There's a lot of people who love this city.''

<HEAD>Shopping for the Recession: Dove Bars Maybe, But No Spaghetti in
Cans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans might put off buying a new car or
stereo until the economy improves, but will they be shopping
differently at the supermarket?
   Yes, no and maybe, food industry analysts say.
   ``Food in general is pretty recession-proof compared to durable
goods. Even higher-priced items do well,'' said Max Busetti, editor
of the Food Industry Newsletter in Alexandria, Va. ``People who
want to treat themselves will buy Dove Bars and cut down on more
expensive durable goods.''
   Pastas, soups, cereals, potatoes and beer are considered classic
recession-proof food items. To this list Busetti adds a '90s
update: budget-priced convenience foods.
   The past decade witnessed a surge in carry-out and convenience
foods, and Busetti said there's no going back to scratch.
   ``People don't have time for scratch,'' he said. ``They will
concentrate more on convenience products that will give them
value.''
   Busetti singled out gourmet-type frozen meals, which already are
showing declining sales, as a product that would suffer.
   ``They're going to stop buying Le Menu at $3.50 a pop and go
back to Swansons. I expect they'll go back to pot pie,'' he said.
   But John McMillin, food industry analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York, predicted people would not change their
shopping habits appreciably.
   ``They'll still buy Hellman's instead of the store-brand
mayonnaise if that's what they like, except maybe they'll cut
coupons for it,'' McMillin said.
   The real savings will come from breaking the eating out habit,
he said.
   ``We spend 8 percent of our disposable income on food at home.
We now spend almost that much on food away from home. ... Unless we
have a pretty severe recession, I think most people will cut
corners by simply eating at home more,'' he said.
   That view was challenged by industry analyst Phil Lempert, of
the Montclair, N.J.- based Lempert Report.
   People won't eat out less but will go to less expensive
restaurants, he predicted. And folks definitely will bargain-hunt
at the supermarket.
   The three analysts did agree that value was the buzzword of the
'90s.
   During the mid-'70s downturn, gourmet items came into their own,
Lempert said.
   ``People who couldn't afford to buy a new car or refrigerator
would buy fancy food for the image it presented - `If I can buy
brie at $5 a pound, I can show my friends I'm still doing well.' As
a matter of fact, I'm not sure upscale items like brie would have
mae it without a recessionary period,'' he said.
   Health concerns - fat, salt, cholesterol - have turned shoppers
into label readers, and they'll use that skill to determine if a
product offers value for the money, Lempert said.
   When asked if his remark about splurging on Dove Bars applied to
more extravagant purchases, like champagne or $30-a-pound chocolate
truffles, Busetti said, ``The mood is different. Even if they can
afford it, people don't want to present an extravagant image. They
might still buy chocolate, but they might not buy Godiva
chocolate.''
   Not surprisingly, Godiva Chocolatier President Thomas Fey said
his product would do well.
   ``I think chocolate in the past, and foods packaged as gift
items in general, have proved fairly recession-proof,'' he said.
``Godiva is an affordable luxury. You can buy a half-pound for $15.
You can't buy too many luxury items for that price.''
   Similarly, Ken Himmel, vice chairman of Sutton Place Gourmet
Inc., stressed value in his company's pricy goods. Sutton Place
Gourmet, with offices in Rockville, Md., operates three fancy food
stores in the Washington area.
   ``People are working harder and working longer because of the
economy, which no longer provides time for eating out or preparing
foods,'' he said.
   So the Thai shrimp and scallops at $15.98 a pound may sound
steep, but it's cheaper than eating in a restaurant, he said.
   The Hansen Caviar Company, in Englewood, N.J., was one of the
few food purveyors to admit that retail sales were down from last
year. But spokesman Richard Bernstein said overall sales were up
because the company has expanded its mail-order and executive gifts
departments.
   ``Hansen learned from the 1973 recession that customers reverted
to entertaining at home,'' a boon to the mail-order side, Bernstein
said. People also are buying lesser grades of caviar, such as
sevruga and osetra, instead of beluga, he said.
   And then there's a more prosaic foodstuff: soup.
   David Hackney, a spokesman for the Campbell's soup company in
Camden, N.J., said soup is living up to its reputation as a food
that does well during hard times.
   In October, Campbell's introduced 20-ounce cans of its most
popular condensed soups that sell for 15 percent less than two 11{
ounce cans.
   The '80s trend toward single-serving sizes is out, although the
portability of the company's 8-ounce Microwave Soup ``adds value to
the product, because someone can economize by taking it to the
office and heating it up there rather than go out for lunch,''
Hackney said.
   ``People seem to be moving back to what we call the center of
the supermarket, buying more canned, packaged and dry goods, less
stuff from the supermarket deli and bakery,'' he said.
   Does that mean a return to eating spaghetti in cans?
   ``God forbid,'' said Lempert.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>

   They spent their youth fighting the
communists in China and their middle age building an economic
miracle in Taiwan under U.S. protection. Now they are old, and want
to go home.
   ``Falling leaves should return to the roots,'' said an aging
member of the Chinese Nationalist Party. ``We don't want to be away
from home forever.''
   He and other diehard anti-communists long for reunification, and
the strength of their desire is pulling Taiwan apart.
   Many native Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of the
island's 20 million people, say they want to remain apart from the
huge, poor, authoritarian country on the mainland.
   They fear the success of Taiwan's developing democracy and
powerful economy will evaporate if Beijing takes over.
   Relations between the rival governments have thawed in recent
years, and hundreds of old Nationalists have visited China. Several
have met contemporaries who lead China, like President Yang
Shangkun, whom they fought in the civil war that ended with a
communist victory in 1949.
   In May, Deng Xiaoping, paramount leader of China, held his first
meeting with a Nationalist Party member in more than 40 years.
   Many in Taiwan's old guard want reunification talks to begin
now, while they still hold power. Most will be forced out of the
government by the end of 1991 under a program to dismantle an
authoritarian system that has ensured Nationalist rule.
   ``Look, Germany has united and South Korea is talking with the
North,'' said Yen, 86, an electoral college member who spoke on
condition only his surname be used. ``Our leaders keep saying there
is only one China, but if we don't hold talks at all, there won't
be reunification in 100 years.''
   Hsu Hsin-liang, a leader of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, bemoans what he calls the romanticism of people
like Yen.
   ``We are more worried that these oldsters would join hands with
the communists to attack Nationalist liberals and thus hamper
Taiwan's democratization,'' he said.
   In a letter to President Yang and Premier Li Peng of China, the
Democracy Alliance in Taiwan accused the old Nationalists of
``making their last try to sell out Taiwan'' before retiring.
   President Lee Teng-hui, born in Taiwan, has pledged to seek
reunification but is proceeding cautiously. As conditions for
talks, he said in a recent speech that China must promote democracy
and a free economic system, renounce the use of force and end its
policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically.
   Members of the Nationalist old guard, in a remarkable reversal
of past attitudes, have described Lee's position as too harsh.
   ``It's like asking your enemy to cut his tongue before you agree
to talk to him,'' Yen said bitterly. ``How long must we wait before
they practice democracy? In 10 years, all of us oldsters will die.
How will talks proceed then?''
   Chang Yu-jen, an 84-year-old National Assemblyman and former
general, agreed it was time for reunification. He led nationalist
troops against communist rebels in central China in the 1940s, but
now has a different attitude toward his old foes.
   ``What's left of Chinese communism is but a scaffold without a
building,'' he said. ``Its rise was a tragedy of the times. It has
now fallen. The trend is for dialogue and reforms.''
   Yen and Chang revisited China recently and say their wish is to
see reunification talks begin before they die. The old leaders in
Beijing echo the feeling.
   Deng said in a meeting with retired Nationalist Gen. Teng Wen-yi
in Beijing in May that he hoped for peaceful reunification in three
years. Both are 86 and they once were schoolmates.
   President Yang told visiting editors of China Times, a major
Taiwan newspaper, the problem should be resolved while the old
Communist and Nationalist party leaders still live.
   Chang and Yen are among more than 600 officeholders who were
elected in China before 1949 and left in office to support the
Nationalist claim to be the sole legitimate government of all
China.
   They fear new deputies who replace them under the
democratization plan will vote to declare Taiwan independent of
China, which has threatened military action if it happens.

<HEAD>Land Reform Illustrates Problems in Ending Apartheid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRANDVLEI, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the vast, rolling countryside
of the northern Transvaal, efforts to end apartheid have sown
conflict between white farmers and millions of blacks who want
land.
   The government has promised that laws prohibiting blacks from
owning property in most of the country will be scrapped next year.
   Instead of easing tension, plans to repeal the Land Acts have
illuminated the deep divisions between blacks and whites about
South Africa's future.
   ``Historical injustices resulting from land-grabbing over three
centuries cannot easily be rectified now,'' the Star newspaper said
in an editorial.
   Under the land laws, 87 percent of South Africa is reserved for
the 5 million whites, most of it agricultural land owned by fewer
than 50,000 farmers.
   The 30 million blacks can own property only in black townships
around cities and in the 10 tribal homelands on the remaining, and
worst, 13 percent of South Africa's land.
   How to undo the disparity is a contentious issues for the
government and such black opposition groups as the African National
Congress as they negotiate a new constitution that will give blacks
political power.
   To blacks, reform means reversing decades of injustice, when
laws perpetuated the white expansion that drove them from the land
of their ancestors.
   Most delegates to a recent ANC workshop on land reform approved
a statement saying, ``The state should play the principal role in
effecting a major redistribution of land.''
   Many white farmers see land reform as a leftist plot to strip
them of their God-given heritage as the proper caretakers of the
land.
   ``We feel there is no way the blacks are going to go onto our
land,'' said Bill Ruthven, a supporter of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party.
   South Africa's Land Acts of 1913 and 1936 forced blacks with
small farms to give them up and move to homelands or work for
whites. The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups say those who lost
their land should get it back and large portions of the country
should be turned over to blacks.
   ``The existing inequitable distribution of land'' must end, said
Joanne Yawitch, coordinator of the private National Land Committee.
``In order to redress the apartheid legacy, there's going to have
to be a strong policy of affirmative action.''
   Ms. Yawitch also is an administrator of the ANC Land Commission.
   A central recommendation of the ANC workshop was a strong
government role in redistributing land, including a program of
loans and grants available to people of all races.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government has offered no formal land
policy, but said ``current title deeds of farmers and landowners
are safe.''
   The South African Development Bank, which provides government
loans for homeland developmewnt, has suggested turning over 5
million acres of state-owned land to blacks. It also recommends
that about 1,000 white farmers with heavy debts to the government
Land Bank sell their land to blacks in exchange for debt
write-offs.
   Such proposals smack of socialism to Ruthven and other white
farmers.
   Most are Afrikaners, the descendents of Dutch settlers who
dominate the government. They were raised on the doctrine that God
chose them to live in South Africa and farm the land.
   Afrikaner farmers generally believe de Klerk has betrayed his
people by seeking to share power with blacks. Some belong to
extreme right-wing groups that have organized private armies and
vowed to keep their land.
   Piet Swart, director of the all-white South African Agricultural
Union, said: ``I don't think we need any government agency going
around and telling people to whom to sell and for how much.
   ``It isn't only a question of changing land ownership; you have
to have the wealth and entrepreneurial skills. I think change is
going to come, not only in agriculture. It's going to take time. It
must take time.''
   His organization contends market forces alone should determine
who buys and sells property after the Land Acts are gone.
   Swart granted such a policy would maintain the status quo, since
few blacks would have the money to buy farmland.
   Johann Hartman of the Transvaal Agriculture Union, the most
conservative chapter of the national organization, said the debate
should focus on how best to use the land.
   ``Agricultural land should be utilized for maximum production,
to feed the people of the land and not for political purposes,'' he
said.
   Ruthven, a burly, bearded man of 53, fears the government or
independent agencies will provide loans or grants for blacks to buy
land. He also opposes affirmative action programs intended to help
blacks become farmers.
   ``For 300 years, the white people have been doing this for
blacks,'' he said. ``Now we're weaning them. We're not
breast-feeding them anymore. My nipples are sore.''

   ``In this country, there aren't
enough white people to handle all the managerial positions,''
Johann Haasbroek said. ``You have to use people of other
cultures.''
   Driving a pickup over bumpy trails cut through maize and wheat
fields northwest of Johannesburg, the 57-year-old farmer explained
why he began promoting black workers more than a decade ago.
   Such radical action was considered suicidal in the right-wing
world of South African farming, but it worked for Haasbroek, who
runs a successful family farm and is setting up another for his
son.
   He employs five whites and ``about 60 or 70'' full-time blacks
at the main farm. Some of the black workers hire seasonal work
crews and manage specific areas of the operation.
   ``When I was young, you'd very seldom get a black man who wanted
to be a foreman,'' Haasbroek said. ``There was a lot of
superstition, more than now, among the blacks. They thought
something would happen to them.''
   Then need and ambition combined, and ``about 12 years ago, one
of my black workers said he was willing to train as a foreman,'' he
said. When pressed, the farmer acknowledged encouraging the man.
   ``I said, `You know it would be much easier if I could have one
of you guys as foreman; it would take a lot of responsibility off
my hands','' he recalled.
   New responsibilities led to new commitment on both sides,
Haasbroek said. Workers displayed a better attitude, he said, and
he let them open a school for their children on the farm.
   Some of the workers attended courses on farm management at
government training centers, at their employer's expense.
   ``They give the basics of how it should be done, not only seen
from a job point of view, but communication among themselves and
other things,'' he said of the training centers.
   The result of it all, in Haasbroek's view, is a stable group of
workers who take pride in the farm.
   ``I'd never say it was expressed in words, but in their way of
doing things, taking responsibility and doing it for themselves,
they're all very proud of the farm,'' he said.
   ``For instance, we have two soccer teams. They always want to
win. They're very proud of the team.''
   People are like trees, Haasbroek said, with some growing taller
and straighter than others.
   ``The big thing is to be able to identify the bloke who can do
it,'' he said. ``There's a lot of potential in these people waiting
to be developed.''

<DATELINE>POVODA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slovak nationalism bottled up
during generations of Czech and Hungarian domination often breaks
loose in Bratislava, but hasn't affected this quiet village 40
miles away.
   A Slovak woman who identified herself only as Agneta said many
children speak both languages in Povoda, a farming community of 600
ethnic Hungarians and 400 Slovaks.
   ``Our only kindergarten is Hungarian language,'' she said.
``Most Slovak parents send their children there. It hasn't been a
problem in the past and I don't see it as one in the future.''
   The people of Povoda say they live in harmony.
   ``As far as remaining part of Czechoslovakia is concerned, we
all have more pressing day-to-day worries,'' Ladislav Dohnansky
told a visitor.
   Down the street, 5-year-old Dusan said, ``My pop is Slovak and
my mom is Hungarian, and I feel both Hungarian and Slovak.'' He
switched languages during the conversation.
   With the end of restrictive communist rule a year ago, Slovaks
in Czechoslovakia's eastern republic gained the freedom to express
their resentment of historic domination by Hungary and more recent
control by the majority Czechs.
   Some nationalists show anger by painting over Hungarian names one University.
``But unless we have a big
freeze, that shouldn't continue.''
   The various changes put the index for all consumer goods and
services at 133.8 in November. That means a hypothetical selection
of goods and services that cost $100 on average in the 1982-84 base
period cost $133.80 last month, up from $125.90 a year ago.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' real
earnings increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent. Still, over
the past year, wages have not kept pace with inflation. Average
weekly earnings for both full-time and part-time, non-supervisory
workers were $348.49 in November, up 3 percent from a year ago.
   For the first 11 months of the year, consumer prices rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 percent - the worst rate
since 1981 and well above last year's 4.6 percent rate.
   However, economists expect the inflation rate to subside to
between 3 percent and 4 percent next year as the slumping economy
further weakens demand and as oil prices turn down.

   To the reviews of the Sean Connery-Michelle
Pfeiffer spy movie ``The Russia House'' add this one from David
Cornwell: an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
   Who's David Cornwell? He's better known by his nom de plume,
John le Carre. He wrote the novel ``The Russia House,'' and a
string of other books about the world of spooks and moles. He is a
soft-spoken, benign-looking man with surprisingly strong opinions,
especially about how his works have been dramatized:
   - ``The Russia House'': ``I'm very pleased with the film, and
very grateful. It's a very classy movie. ... I think it contains
the best performances of any dramatization of my stuff. I'd give it
an 8 to 9 out of 10, for my requirements.
   ``It's not my vision of the story, and I don't expect it to be.
It's got to function as a movie. As long as the characters are not
cast, they live separately in everybody's imagination. Physically,
my Barley (the English publisher who is enlisted in the spy plot)
looked more like Peter O'Toole, gangly and more strange.''
   - ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'' (1966): ``I thought it
was pretty good, and it stands up. It was a terrible pity that it
was shot in black and white. I was never comfortable with Richard
Burton. I thought that he at that time was beginning to look
debauched rather than experienced. I wished we had had somebody
like a Trevor Howard or a Peter Finch, somebody more rugged. I
always thought that Burton had a soft center.''
   - ``The Deadly Affair'' (1966): ``Sidney Lumet made a little
movie of my first book, with James Mason, Simone Signoret, Max
Schell, Harry Andrews. It didn't quite work.''
   -``The Looking Glass War'' (1969): ``A perfectly dreadful film,
which to my mind didn't rate at all. It was embarrassing and
disappeared quickly.''
   - ``The Little Drummer Girl'' (1984): ``One of those failures
which in retrospect annoy me deeply. There was no studio
interference. George Roy Hill could make the film he wanted to. It
should have been a lovely movie, but we somehow got the wrong spine
out of it, the wrong thread. In my view, in retrospect, it was
terribly miscast (Diane Keaton was the spy). It was embarrassing,
and I was quite pleased when it left the screen.''
   Le Carre said that the long-form of the PBS-TV miniseries
sometimes better suited his books. ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy''
was ``absolutely wonderful,'' and ``Smiley's People'' was ``not at
all bad.'' Alec Guinness played the burned-out George Smiley in
both.
   ``We spoke of an actor's limiting one's perception of
characters,'' said the author. ``Alec didn't do that. He left the
possibilities of Smiley open in the eyes of the beholder.''
   John le Carre has been the premier chronicler of Cold War
espionage, but he feels no loss from the war's end.
   ``For me, it was absolutely wonderful,'' he said. ``I was sick
of writing about the Cold War. The cheap joke was to say, `Poor old
le Carre, he's run out of material; they's taken his (Berlin) wall
away.'
   ``The reverse was true. I wondered what more there was to be
said about a locked-up confrontation that was going on and on and
on. Everything was becoming so stereotyped. I was trying to thaw
the ice in my own imagination. I thought I had ended the cycle in
`Smiley's People.' Then I went back to it with `A Perfect Spy.'
Then `The Russia House' I really thought was ending it.''
   Le Carre figures he makes the break with his new book, ``The
Secret Pilgrim.''
   ``Ned, who is played by James Fox in `The Russia House,' is
approaching 60 and is the head of training in British
intelligence,'' he said. ``He invites Smiley to address the
`pass-out' dinner, when new agents go out to their assignments.
Through that device, we go back through a series of linked episodes
in Ned's life. It makes it a kind of fictional autobiography of the
Cold War, then a pondering on who we are now that the East-West
confrontation is over.
   ``Who we are is really a serious mystery to us, because we have
been identified by our enemies for a long time. Capitalism was seen
as the godly version of communism, if you like. ... That convenient
kind of reference has disappeared. Communism is now a minority
religion.
   ``In a strange way, we're a force without an opponent. We can
talk about Saddam Hussein, but we can't turn Islam into
communism.''
   He remains astounded by the onrush of events in Eastern Europe,
but Le Carre has no concern about finding new material.
   ``The spy story has only to pack up its bags and go where the
action is,'' he said. ``The whole world wants intelligence on the
Middle East, on Central America, South America. What the hell is
going to happen to Cuba now that it's a left-over imperial colony
with no empire to control it? Africa is constantly in flames.
Southeast Asia is a mystery. Will the new wave take over in China?
   ``These are massive requirements of the intelligence system.
Insofar as the spy novel goes ahead of that or behind that, the
espionage industry is having a boom time.''

   Bill Laimbeer was embarrassed.
   The baddest of the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys groaned meekly and
squirmed like a boy just kissed by his sister.
   He was on the radio with J.P. McCarthy, Detroit's king of the
airwaves.
   With McCarthy painting a kinder, gentler picture of the Pistons'
swaggering, scowling basketball forward, Laimbeer was reduced to a
mushy, 6-foot-11 slice of humble pie.
   ``He's the No. 1 guy around,'' Laimbeer said of McCarthy, whose
6-10 a.m. radio show consistently tops the local ratings. ``He's a
powerful guy. I wouldn't want to have him on my case.''
   Heady stuff from a guy who's made a career of offending
millions.
   But that's the sway Joseph Priestley McCarthy holds after 26
years as the top radio personality in America's sixth-largest radio
market.
   McCarthy's power rests on the audience he has built.
Politicians, business executives and other community leaders
frequently appear on his show to get their message out, even those
who rarely give interviews to other news media people.
   ``What McCarthy has been able to do is sit down and converse
with the Ford worker, the housewife in Troy or the janitor down in
Toledo,'' said Don Fitzpatrick, president of Don Fitzpatrick
Associates, a television talent and management recruiting company
in San Francisco.
   With a mellifluous, pull-up-a-chair voice that could melt the
polar ice cap, McCarthy hands out compliments on his morning show
and the early afternoon ``Focus'' interview program like a letter
carrier delivers the mail.
   ``He's got a captivating personality, a voice that sounds like,
`Here's a guy that wouldn't fool with you,''' said Neal Shine,
publisher of the Detroit Free Press, the morning newspaper in the
city of about 1 million.
   But McCarthy is more than a back-slapper.
   He can converse freely and without preparation with presidents
and pitchers, millionaires and mothers. If there's a question that
needs asking, he'll ask it. Straight answers usually follow.
   ``If he asks you a tough question, you feel obligated to answer
it,'' Shine said.
   Born in New York and raised on Detroit's east side, McCarthy got
his first broadcasting job in 1955 with Armed Services Radio in
Fairbanks, Alaska.
   He worked three months at WTAC-AM in Flint, Mich., before
starting at Detroit's WJR in 1957. He spent two years at KGO-AM in
San Francisco in the early 1960s and then returned to Detroit and
WJR on Dec. 7, 1964.
   McCarthy said he came back to WJR with an eye on bigger things.
   ``I really thought I wasn't going to be here very long,'' he
said. ``I thought I was going to Los Angeles or New York. But you
get caught up in something that's going pretty well.''
   Arbitron Co., a New York-based marketing information service
company, estimates about 3.6 million people over age 12 - those who
count in market-share studies - live in Detroit and surrounding
counties.
   But J.P. is heard by many more folks because of WJR's
50,000-watt, clear-channel signal, which federal regulations
protects from competition within a 750-mile radius. The station's
regular daytime audience extends throughout Michigan and into
Canada, northern Indiana, northeastern Illinois, most of Ohio and
western Pennsylvania.
   Partly because of his popularity and partly because of WJR's
range, there are few people McCarthy can't get on the air.
   He talked with George Bush on a live telephone hookup the day
before he was sworn in as president. Gov.-elect John Engler was in
the studio the morning after he upset Gov. James Blanchard.
``Jeopardy'' game show host Alex Trebek was a recent ``Focus''
guest.
   ``I look forward to different people for different reasons,''
McCarthy said. ``My favorite interview will be the next good one I
have.''
   ABC-TV says McCarthy was among the leading candidates to take
over as host of ``Good Morning America'' when David Hartman retired
in 1986. But McCarthy says he's still bitter because he feels he
wasn't given a fair shot at the job, which went to Charles Gibson.
   McCarthy had a television program on WJBK-TV in Detroit in
1983-86, and he says he'd go back to TV for the right opportunity.
   ``But I'm really quite happy where I am,'' he said.
   He gets eight weeks vacation, a salary that industry experts
estimate between $300,000 and $500,000 a year, national advertising
contracts with Chrysler and Kelly Services, a work day that
invariably ends at noon and far-flung influence.
   ``He gets more time off than Johnny Carson,'' said basketball
commentator Dick Vitale, a former Pistons coach and a regular guest
on McCarthy's show, when he was told on a recent program McCarthy
was on vacation.
   McCarthy said he enjoys the privileges he has earned.
   ``I kind of like being J.P. McCarthy. I suppose I enjoy the
power. It's fun.''

   There's no hiding the festive spirit inside the
spectacular apartment where Imelda Marcos lives, high above the
Manhattan skyline with a sweeping view of the East River.
   There are not one but two artificial Christmas trees in the
living room, one snow-white and festooned with pink ribbons and
another traditional green tree with ornaments. In one corner, Mrs.
Marcos plays the piano as members of her staff look on admiringly.
   But appearances can be deceiving. All is not going well for Mrs.
Marcos.
   Though she was acquitted on all counts following a lengthy trial
on federal racketeering and fraud charges in July, she faces a
myriad of civil lawsuits.
   A multimillion-dollar civil suit, based on the same racketeering
charges as the criminal trial, has been lodged against her by the
Philippine government in Los Angeles federal court. That case
should go to trial in about a year.
   The U.S. government also intends to retry Mrs. Marcos on those
same charges in a separate civil suit next year.
   Worse still, she says, because she is viewed as a ``security
threat,'' Mrs. Marcos is required to notify and receive permission
from the U.S. Justice Department at least 48 hours before she wants
to leave Manhattan.
   She has no passport and her current lawyer, James Linn of
Oklahoma City, said the federal government has not indicated when
it might lift the travel restrictions against her. The Filipino
government does not want her back.
   The former Filipino ``Mother of the Nation'' has become a
real-life prisoner of Second Avenue, tethered to her home near the
United Nations.
   ``I am beleaguered,'' said Mrs. Marcos during a recent interview
in her 42nd-floor apartment on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, one of
several she rents in the building.
   ``Do you know what it's like to survive without freedom in a
foreign country? You try to uphold your dignity, but you're living
in a vacuum. You're not in your own country, you're uprooted.''
   All she wants, Mrs. Marcos said, is to return to the Philippines
``so I can flourish and grow and live and love again.'' She also
wishes to bring back the remains of her husband for a proper
burial.
   ``It's overwhelming,'' Mrs. Marcos said of her predicament.
``It's good that I'm Oriental. I'm attuned to the spirit of Zen
Buddhism, that you are nothing and everything at the same time.''
   Ferdinand Marcos died in Hawaii in September 1989, three years
after he was swept from power in a ``people's revolution'' led by
Corazon Aquino.
   His declining health and his demise meant he was spared a trial
on charges that he and his wife illegally transferred $160 million
from the Philippines and defrauded financial institutions of $165
million.
   Mrs. Marcos went to trial and was acquitted. Six months later,
she continues to protest her innocence and that of her husband.
   ``Marcos was not bad, he was not considered a thief until he
landed here,'' she said. ``The CIA, Interpol, they all knew Marcos
for 20 years. Then all of a sudden, he is a thief. It is all a
mistake.''
   She displays sheaves of documents attesting to the Marcoses'
finances, and even an affectionate letter that President Reagan
wrote to them shortly after they arrived in Hawaii in exile. Reagan
called Marcos a ``patriot.''
   Now, she said, she has become a pariah as a result of what she
sees as an unfounded and puzzling public persecution.
   ``The Marcos issue has become so humongous that every leader in
this country is afraid to touch me with a 10-foot pole,'' she said.
   As she talked, Mrs. Marcos sat at the dining room table
clutching a rosary. She wore a black dress with a beaded necklace
and scarf and matching black suede shoes. Her nails were polished
in a pink and white French manicure.
   She also wore a pair of diamond, sapphire and ruby earrings with
a matching ring, two pieces of the jewelry she says she hurriedly
stuffed into her grandchildren's diapers when she and her husband
were given one hour to clear out of Malacanang Palace in Manila in
February 1986.
   Though even her former lawyer, Gerry Spence, labeled her a
``world-class shopper'' during her trial, Mrs. Marcos insisted that
most of her purchases were for the good of her country.
   ``I shopped for my country because for 400 years the whole world
shopped on my country,'' she said. ``I started buying paintings and
all sorts of things to bring the world back to the Philippines. I
wanted to rebuild our cultural identity.''
   Mrs. Marcos' infamous shoe collection remains in Manila. She
said she now has only about two dozen pairs in her Manhattan
closets.
   But Mrs. Marcos said she has ``no attachment to material
things.''
   ``I would shop more for others,'' she said. ``Most of my jewelry
and valuables were given to me by my family and my husband.''
   She said she has ``no regrets,'' allowing that if she did do
anything unseemly, it was merely out ``love and responsibility''
for her country.
   ``One makes mistakes, but they aren't deliberate,'' she said.
``If there was an excess, it was because my love for my country was
in excess.''
   Her extravagant life in Manila, she said, was fueled in part by
her belief that a first lady ``is someone who the people want to
look up to. You had to be a star.''
   The woman who had 15,000 people at her wedding after a courtship
that lasted 11 days now lives quietly with a small household staff
and a fw old friends who check on her regularly. Her son,
Ferdinand Jr., lives in New York. Her two daughters are abroad.
   She said she needs no more than two or three hours of sleep a
night and fills her days conferring with her lawyer about pending
cases. Most of of her former entourage, known as the ``Blue
Ladies,'' rarely contact her, she said, out of fear they will be
punished by the current Filipino regime.
   She is not entirely gloomy. She eagerly shows photographs of her
visits with world leaders, from Fidel Castro to Saddam Hussein. She
proudly displays pictures of cultural centers and hospitals she
built in the Philippines.
   She giggles flirtatiously with her lawyer and a photographer as
members of her staff hover and look at her in adoration.
   ``Things don't faze me,'' she said. ``I don't miss being in the
palace because the palace is in my heart.''
   But she does miss the Philippines.
   ``I'm a widow,'' she said. ``My husband is dead. And I'm
orphaned from my motherland. It's inhumane and immoral.''

   Sam Eagle Staff still mourns the death
of the several hundred Sioux who fell in a cold, grassy valley when
U.S. cavalry troops opened fire on an Indian camp a century ago.
   ``We feel it was a murdering of our people without weapons,''
says Eagle Staff, whose uncle was one of the victims. ``What
happened there must have been a nightmare, something hard to live
with if you were there.''
   The Dec. 29, 1890, bloodshed at Wounded Knee was the last major
armed conflict between government troops and Indians. It also wiped
out the Sioux's last dream of ridding their lands of white
invaders.
   The Army called it a battle.
   The Sioux call it a massacre, a needless slaughter of mostly
unarmed Indian men, women and children by cavalry troops seeking
revenge for Lt. Col. George Custer's death at the Battle of the
Little Big Horn in Montana more than a decade earlier.
   Though they still feel hurt and sorrow, many Indians also see
the 100th anniversary as a chance to mend the Sioux Nation's sacred
hoop - their spiritual and cultural traditions.
   Riders on horseback are retracing the trail Chief Big Foot took
to Wounded Knee a century ago, and ceremonies will be held Saturday
in memory of those slain at the southwestern South Dakota site.
   The Lakota, which is what the Sioux call themselves, see new
hope for better race relations since South Dakota Gov. George
Mickelson proclaimed 1990 as the Year of Reconciliation between
Indians and whites.
   The anniversary offers the Sioux a chance to tell their side of
the story and to continue their effort to recover land,
particularly the nearby Black Hills, which they consider sacred.
   ``We want to send a note to everyone in the country and the
world that this type of thing will never happen again to any
Indians or any nationality,'' said Eagle Staff, a leader of a group
of descendants of Wounded Knee victims.
   The site lies in a valley flanked by pine-dotted ridges that
provide the name for the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the home of
the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
   In a tiny cemetery atop a small knoll, a chain-link fence
surrounds a mass grave where 146 Indians were buried in a long
trench. A tattered white flag flies over the site, and pieces of
cloth and bird feathers hang from the fence and flutter in the
wind.
   A stone monument for Big Foot and the people who died with him
stands to the side of the burial trench. Part of the message carved
in the stone says: ``Many innocent women and children who knew no
wrong died here.''
   What happened still is debated. Accounts from Indians and the
cavalry differed greatly.
   Government records show about 150 Indians were killed and 44
were wounded, while 30 or more soldiers died. The Sioux argue that
at least 300 Indians and perhaps more than 400 were slain at
Wounded Knee.
   The Sioux had been the dominant tribe in the northern Plains for
about a century after getting horses from other tribes and guns
from French traders. The Sioux warrior society peaked in 1876, when
they defeated Custer.
   Their fortunes rapidly went downhill after that, however, when
treaties stripped them of land and forced them onto reservations in
South Dakota.
   By 1890, the Ghost Dance religion had arisen with a promise that
the land and the decimated buffalo herds would be restored to the
Sioux and the white man would be swept away.
   After Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed, Miniconjou Chief Big
Foot led a band of about 400 Sioux from central South Dakota to
seek refuge at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern
South Dakota.
   Cavalry troops found Big Foot's band, and by Dec. 29, the
rebuilt 7th Cavalry that Custer had commanded at the Little Big
Horn joined the other soldiers. Big Foot's camp was flying a white
flag.
   Accounts differ as to who fired first, but the shooting began
when the troops were collecting the Indians' guns. According to the
most common story, two soldiers wrestled with an Indian holding a
gun and the weapon fired.
   Army officers said a warrior took a rifle hidden under a blanket
and shot. When they heard that, the soldiers opened fire. The Ghost
Dance shirts worn by some of the Indians did not protect them.
   William Horn Cloud, 84, of Pine Ridge, heard the story of
Wounded Knee from his father, who was 14 when he survived the
fight. He and other descendants say soldiers drank heavily the
night before and wanted to settle an old score.
   ``They wanted revenge for Custer,'' says Horn Cloud. ``They were
there for one reason, and I guess they had a barrel of whiskey with
them.''
   Since they were in a circle, soldiers who died at Wounded Knee
probably were killed by their own gunfire, Horn Cloud says - the
same fusillade that cut down women and children as they tried to
escape to a nearby ravine.
   ``Those soldiers were shooting those screaming kids down,'' he
said.
   Each December for the past four years, Alex White Plume and
others have mounted horses and followed the trail that led Big
Foot's band to their death. They rode, he said, because they wanted
to change the future of the Sioux.
   This year's trail ride is the last one.
   White Plume, whose great-grandfather died at Wounded Knee, said
Sioux holy man Black Elk described how the sacred hoop of the Sioux
nation was shattered at Wounded Knee. Seven generations later, the
Sioux must mend the sacred hoop and rebuild themselves, he said.
   White Plume is not the only Sioux who is intent on looking
forward. The tribe lauds the governor's reconciliation effort.
   ``There is prejudice here in South Dakota. We hope to eliminate
this some day,'' said Eagle Staff. ``It can be done, but it's going
to take a long, long time. This is just the beginning.''
   The Wounded Knee Survivors Association asked Congress to issue
an apology, pay compensation to descendants and create a national
monument at Wounded Knee. In October, Congress passed a resolution
expressing ``deep regret'' for Wounded Knee. Many Sioux said it
wasn't much of an apology.
   But Eagle Staff said members of the survivors' group decided to
accept the congressional resolution as an apology, based on a
pledge that more attention would be paid to the national monument
and the compensation issue.
   Still, there is a lingering distrust. Some want the government
to revoke the congressional Medals of Honor given to soldiers who
were at Wounded Knee.
   Horn Cloud describes his idea for a monument: Some cannons on a
hill, with a statue of a soldier firing into a huddled group of
Indian children.
   ``His chest would be all filled up with medals for bravery,''
Horn Cloud said.

   A hundred years later, they're still fighting
the battle of Wounded Knee - in Congress.
   In October, Congress passed a resolution expressing the
government's ``deep regret'' for the bloodshed that ended the
Indian wars on Dec. 29, 1890. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,
chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said the
resolution amounted to an official apology.
   But the word ``apology'' was stricken from the draft that the
descendants wanted passed, and Congress did not act on accompanying
demands for reparations and a national monument.
   ``We were promised things and then the promises never
materialized,'' said Mario Gonzalez, a lawyer for the Wounded Knee
Survivors Association, which has 70 to 80 members.
   Members of South Dakota's congressional delegation say they'll
pursue compensation and a monument next year, and the Bush
administration has embraced the idea of a monument.
   The tangled politics and historical disputes that still surround
the events of 100 years ago surfaced when frustrated descendants
bitterly attacked the delegation's two Democrats.
   Sen. Tom Daschle and Rep. Tim Johnson are ``right-wing Indian
haters at heart,'' said Gonzalez.
   He called Daschle the ``David Duke of the North,'' referring to
the former Ku Klux Klan leader who ran for U.S. Senate from
Louisiana.
   ``There's a real macho cowboy attitude out there,'' said Suzan
Harjo, a lobbyist for Indian causes in Washington. ``If the
Congress of the United States had said, `We apologized,' ... I
don't think that would have meant the end of the republic as we
know it.''
   Daschle said he intended to ``work doubly hard this next
Congress to see if we can obtain the necessary funds for a
memorial. That to me is critical.''
   The delegation also hopes to win compensation in the form of
tribal health, education, housing and job benefits, he said.
   ``That would ... lead to the greatest reversal of many of the
things that have happened in the last 100 years,'' Daschle said.
   A Bush administration official called Wounded Knee a massacre.
   ``Because of the deaths of women and children and non-combatants
and unarmed men, it is a massacre. It is not an incident that
should pass on December 29 without recognition on part of the
government,'' said Knute Knudson, a former South Dakotan who is
deputy chief of staff for the U.S. Interior Department.
   Between 150 and 400 Sioux, depending on the historical account,
were killed by U.S. Army cavalry troops at Wounded Knee on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
   The descendants wanted Congress to declare the site a national
monument, which would make it a part of the National Park Service,
and pay for the estimated $20,000 in property that was taken from
the victims, plus interest.
   The congressional delegation, however, was divided on the
requests, no committee hearing was held until late September, and
money for a park service study wasn't requested until October, when
it was too late.
   South Dakotans have widely differing opinions, Johnson said.
Some wholeheartedly support the Indians' request; others say
Indians were to blame for the killings.
   The survivors association initially refused to accept the
resolution as an apology but reversed itself after Inouye promised
to pursue the other requests next year.
   ``I would sincerely hope that the Wounded Knee Survivors
Association would reconsider accepting (the resolution) as the
fulfillment of a well-deserved apology from the United States
government,'' Inouye wrote.
   The Interior Department's official position is that fewer people
were killed than descendants claim. But the department wants to do
a year-long study and plans to ask Congress for the money next
year, Knudson said.

   Alejandro Morfin ran his fingers over the
hairline cracks creeping into the Diego Rivera mural of peasants
bending over a bountiful wheat harvest.
   ``These fissures didn't exist and they're beginning to work
their way up,'' the art restorer said, looking toward the top of
the wall.
   ``La Era'' is one of 124 panels of frescoes Rivera painted at
the Public Education Department, one of the prolific muralist's
major works. Like other landmark buildings nearby, the early
20th-century structure is shifting on the spongy clay lakebed under
the city's historic downtown.
   Severe cracks from the big 1985 earthquake and the building's
structural faults add to the deterioration.
   Frescoes are painted directly on walls before the plaster dries
and aren't made to move. As the building has settled, some of the
scenes of workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers and high
society painted on the walls of its inner patios in the 1920s have
cracked.
   Six panels of the national treasures have had to be removed, a
risky, tedious process used only as a last resort.
   Dozens of others have been sealed with cloth, foam rubber and
plywood, bandages to protect them from further damage during
restoration work on the building.
   Forests of crosshatched timbers shore up arches around the
patios.
   ``If it weren't propped up, it would have begun to fall down,''
said Morfin, who heads a team of four protecting the murals until
repairs are complete.
   A jagged crack from the devastating earthquake of Sept. 19,
1985, splits the north and west walls from the top floor to the
ground. At Morfin's feet, a crack breaks the red tile floor, snakes
up the 14-foot walls on either side where murals had been removed,
and into the ceiling.
   Adding to the problems, a huge staircase built in the 1940s
pulls on the building. It vibrates from traffic and construction
work. Cracks run through it like networks of nerves. To relieve
pressure, weight was removed; the building moves to adjust.
   The pumping of water to keep the excavated ruins of the Aztecs'
Great Temple dry and on display has worsened the sinking problem
for the Education Department, Metropolitan Cathedral, National
Palace and other buildings in the area, said Morfin and officials
of the government's National Center for Conservation of Artistic
Works.
   ``The building is compressing. It's working with different
pressures,'' Morfin said.
   And, as in many old buildings, humidity seeps through its walls.
   When the conservation center, part of the National Fine Arts
Institute, gave Morfin responsibility for the Rivera murals in
March, one-third were slated for special protection while the
building is repaired. Now, there are more than 60.
   ``Only the north and south walls were contemplated. Now we have
to cover almost all the west,'' he said.
   Rivera began the murals in early 1923. He had spent more than a
decade in Europe, then returned in Mexico to become reacquainted
with his people and their problems after the 1910-21 revolution.
   Rejecting abstract art, he directed his painting toward the
masses rather than the elite, creating a nationalist, educational
school that became internationally recognized.
   Scenes of peasants and laborers struggling to improve their
lives; meetings of the proletariat contrasting with fancy dinners
of capitalists; revolutionary martyrs, heroes and soldiers are the
result.
   ``Since the Public Education Department more than any other
public building is the building of the people, the theme of its
decoration could not be anything other than the life of the people
themselves,'' Rivera is quoted as saying in an Education Department
book on the murals.
   On the second floor and part of the third, a series of
gray-toned frescoes painted to look like low reliefs depict
science, architecture, research, dance, music, medicine and other
intellectual pursuits. They contrast with the rich colors of the
other murals.
   Removing frescoes is a tricky business.
   Animal resin is applied, then gauzy cotton, and the painting is
pulled off. Upside down on a table in a room set aside for the
restoration project, it is flattened under weights. When the team
is satisfied, it's turned right side up and a steam chamber is
created to soften it. Hot compresses are applied and the cotton is
peeled off gingerly.
   ``It's only done when there's a great risk of losing the work.
It's a last resort,'' said Alejandro Flores, another member of the
team.
   Of the six murals removed, one is on display at a museum and the
others are in storage or being restored.
   Officials hope to have the murals on display again in 1992, but
say the project may take longer.
   Some of Rivera's other murals, such as those at the National
Preparatory Institute and the National Palace, are awaiting
conservation teams.
   ``Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park'' was moved to a
museum built behind the park after the Del Prado Hotel was heavily
damaged by the 1985 earthquake. That mural was not painted directly
on the wall, however.
   Rivera also painted murals in San Francisco, Detroit and New
York. Murals done for Rockefeller Center in New York that included
a portrait of Lenin were destroyed.

   The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said that banks must soon ump billions of dollars more into
the fast-dwindling government fund guaranteeing customers'
deposits.
   ``Action should be taken early next year,'' FDIC Chairman L.
William Seidman told the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions.
   Figures included in his testimony indicate he believes banks
should be required to pay a one-time assessment totaling $24
billion to $25 billion.
   Bankers reacted cautiously to the proposal.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mortgage delinquencies rose sharply from July
through September, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported in a
survey that it said was further proof the economy is in a downturn.
   The association survey found the delinquency rate was 5.0
percent, up from 4.52 percent in the second quarter and 4.41
percent in the first. The rate in the third quarter of 1989 was
4.96 percent.
   The survey also found that foreclosures had risen slightly. The
0.33 percent rate compared with a 0.31 percent rate in the previous
quarter.

   HONG KONG (AP) - The largest bank in Hong Kong announced it was
transferring all assets offshore, a move that was likely to damage
confidence in the British colony reverting to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Chairman William Purves said
the decision reflected the bank's global reach and did not signal
abandonment of the territory where it has flourished for 125 years.
   Nonetheless, stock brokers and others with a feel for Hong
Kong's financial pulse said the move would be interpreted as
another sign of eroding confidence in the future of the teeming
capitalist enclave on China's southern tip.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Trans World Airlines Inc. will get desperately
needed cash by selling valued London routes to American Airlines,
but the retrenchment will make TWA a smaller, weaker carrier facing
an uncertain future, analysts said.
   TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn said a day earlier he was selling six
London routes for $445 million to American. Further agreements
bring the total package to $625 million.
   Analysts said that in the short run the deal gives TWA needed
cash. But in the long run, it could cause problems as one of the
nation's weaker carriers surrenders its traditional strong suit.

year between a U.S. network news division and a Japanese
broadcaster.
   NBC News will have exclusive U.S. rights to all Japanese and
international news material of NTV, Japan's largest private

   NEW YORK (AP) - RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said it will offer
cash and stock in exchange for more than $750 million in costly
junk bonds as part of an expanded effort to lower the food-tobacco
conglomerate's debt load.
   RJR Nabisco, taken private in a record $24.53 billion leveraged
buyout last year, has been reducing its most expensive debt to try
to avoid finance problems that have plagued other heavily indebted
companies in recent months.
   The announcement on Monday follows the completion last month of
a $6.9 billion recapitalization effort that included retirement of
more than $4 billion in junk bonds and a $1.15 billion bridge loan.

   THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS (AP) - Iran agreed to pay $9 million to a
subsidiary of the American oil giant Arco, the last of hundreds of
millions of dollars in so-called Consortium claims of Western oil
companies against Teheran.
   The settlement on Monday was for expropriation of Arco's
operations in Iran during the 1979 Islamic revolution that
overthrew the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   Total compensation to the 14 British, French and American oil
companies in the Consortium has amounted to $320 million since
1982, according to figures broadcast over Teheran Radio, monitored

all-digital high-definition television system as Zenith's entry in
the HDTV sweepstakes.
   The system, touted on Monday as an improvement over a partially
digital system previously announced by Zenith, keeps the
manufacturer in the running for the coveted HDTV standard to be
selected by the Federal Communications Commission.
   The standard will be the sole format used by cable, satellite
and major commercial networks to provide Americans with the
crystal-clear pictures and compact-disc-quality sound of HDTV.

   Some bankers say they're willing to chip in more
to help rescue the government's ailing deposit insurance fund, but
say they want substantial reforms in banking regulations.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman on
Monday floated a proposal to boost the insurance fund by $24
billion.
   The proposal comes as industry officials and regulators ponder
ideas to dramatically restructure the nation's banks, which have
been beset by a stagnant economy, strong foreign competition,
declining real estate values and rising loan defaults.
   In the past 3{ years, 734 banks with $102 billion in total
assets have failed, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. The failures have drained the government's deposit insurance
fund from $18.3 billion in 1987 to an estimated $9 billion this
year, the FDIC reported. The fund is used to repay up to $100,000
in individual deposits in the event of a bank failure.
   ``I think there's no question the fund needs to be replenished,
that one way or another the industry is going to have to pay for
it. That's been the history since it's been established,'' said
John Rau, president and chief executive officer of LaSalle National
Bank in Chicago.
   But bankers say if they're asked to help rescue the fund, they
want federal banking laws reformed. They complain that current
regulations hamper them from competing with securities firms and
other large corporations that offer loans, credit cards and other
such financial services.
   Richard A. Kirk, president of American Bankers Association, said
any deposit insurance rescue must come with ``...modernization of
the financial system if future problems are to be prevented.''
   Kirk and others don't question the FDIC's grim predictions of
the fund's solvency, but says the banking industry overall is
healthy. The nation's 12,400 banks enjoyed a 13 percent increase in
profits for the third quarter of 1990, he said.
   Seidman, in prepared testimony before the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions, fell short of endorsing the
$24 billion plan.
   A similar strategy was used in 1984 when Congress voted to
strengthen the credit union fund. Under the bill, credit unions
were required to deposit 1 percent of insured shares into the fund,
he said.
   Seidman also suggested annual deposit insurance premiums should
be raised to 23 cents per $100 in deposits. He also discussed other
options, such as requiring banks to buy preferred stock in the
FDIC.
   He said the proposals would ``add only marginally to bank
failures.''
   That view was disputed, however, by three private economists -
R. Dan Brumbaugh of San Francisco, Robert Litan of the Brookings
Institution and James Barth of Auburn University - who presented a
report to the House panel.
   Brumbaugh said a one percent assessment on deposits would cost
banks the equivalent of two years of earnings. Litan said it would
cause additional failures costing $3 billion to $8 billion.
   Seidman also raised the possibility that regulators may hold off
shutting down weak banks that appear likely to recover, citing the
success of such a policy toward struggling farm banks in the
mid-1980s.
   Many bankers declined to comment on Seidman's statements until
they had a chance to review the proposals in detail.
   ``Our reaction in general has always been that every participant
in the financial services industry should be regulated by the same
standards,'' said Fraser Seitel, spokesman for Chase Manhattan
Corp. He, like others in the industry, endorses changes in banking
regulations to provide a level playing field with non-financial
corporations that provide some financial services.
   They object, for example, that AT&amp;T can offer its Universal
credit card without facing the same regulations as banks.
   Fritz Elmendorf, spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association
in Arlington, Va., said most bankers are willing to pay more into
the fund and avoid a taxpayer bailout along the lines of the
savings and loan scandal. Failures of the nation's savings and
loans are estimated to cost the nation's taxpayers billions of
dollars.
   ``It's an argument on how much the industry can truly afford,
and that's where it's unclear,'' said Elmendorf.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. may have leapfrogged
into the lead of the high-definition television race with a
proposed all-digital system that offers better picture resolution
than its competitors, analysts said.
   ``On paper, it still looks to me like the best of the
proposals,'' James Magid, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co. in New
York, said of the project that Zenith and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. announced Monday.
   The HDTV system that Zenith is developing jointly with the AT&amp;T
would transmit 1,575 horizontal picture lines every one-thirtieth
of a second compared with competing systems based on 1,125 or 1,050
lines. The pictures on today's TV sets are composed of 300
horizontal lines.
   The companies are competing with four other groups for the
coveted HDTV standard to be selected by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   The standard will be the sole format used by cable, satellite
and major commercial networks to provide Americans with the
crystal-clear pictures and compact-disc-quality sound of HDTV.
   Analysts said Zenith had to come up with an all-digital system
to keep pace with two other contenders - General Instruments Corp.
and a consortium of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, Thomson of
France, the NBC network and the David Sarnoff Research Center -
which previously made all-digital proposals.
   The other contenders for the HDTV standard are the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Fully digital systems can transmit HDTV signals in the ones and
zeros of computer language, making for clear reception even on the
fringe of a broadcaster's range. Zenith previously had proposed a
partially digital system.
   David Lauchenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, an
industry journal, said Zenith appears to have caught up with its
competitors in the all-digital area and may have surpassed them in
picture resolution.
   But he noted that the systems' relative merits won't really be
known until the FCC tests them, one by one, beginning next April.
   ``These things, I think, exist mainly on computers,''
Lauchenbruch said.
   Zenith spokesman John Taylor said Zenith and AT&amp;T already were
working toward an all-digital or mostly digital system prior to the
proposals made earlier this year by General Instruments and the
Philips consortium.
   ``We did it to reap the benefits of digital technology, to
provide interference-free and snow-free pictures,'' Taylor said.
   The test period for Zenith's system begins in late October,
Taylor said. The FCC hopes to select a standard by June 1993.
   Backers of HDTV say it could revitalize segments of the U.S.
electronics industry and - through military, educational and
medical spinoffs - be the linchpin for U.S. economic growth in the
next century.
   Zenith, the last major U.S.-based television manufacturer, is
gambling heavily on its system being chosen as the HDTV standard.
The company sold its computer division in 1989 and has committed
$50 million to HDTV research, in which it is cooperating with AT&amp;T
and its Bell Labs subsidiary.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and United airlines are lined up to fly
into London, but questions about whether they will be allowed to
land at the city's choice airport, Heathrow, cast doubts on the
carriers' plans.
   United agreed in October to buy most of Pan Am's London routes
for $400 million. American said Sunday it would buy TWA's London
routes and others overseas for $445 million.
   A treaty between Britain and the United States says only TWA,
Pan Am and their ``corporate successors'' can fly trans-Atlantic
routes from Heathrow, which is the closest airport to London and
served by the city's subway system.
   Negotiators for the British and U.S. governments are scheduled
to meet later this week in London to discuss whether that means
United and American can gain entry to Heathrow.
   Since 1977, the British government has disallowed any new
carriers at Heathrow, forcing them to Gatwick and other airports.
   Several British carriers also want slots at the airport and
argue that American and United qualify as new carriers, rather than
as two that are merely assuming existing routes.
   ``Whether they're right or wrong for doing it, (British
carriers) will try to read more into this,'' Paul Karos, an airline
analyst for First Boston, said Monday.
   Entry to Heathrow is key to both the United-Pan Am deal and the
American-TWA deal.
   ``All we're suggesting is one airline be allowed to substitute
or take the place of another, which does not seem unreasonable to
us given the changing fortunes of companies in the world of
business,'' said Robert Crandall, president of Fort Worth-based
American.
   United chairman Stephen Wolf has also said the carrier's
agreement with Pan Am would not proceed without access to Heathrow.
   Both airline executives think they will be allowed to fly to
Heathrow.
   ``This matter is likely to be resolved at least in part on the
longstanding goodwill between the United States and the United
Kingdom and by ... the fact we're not really asking for anything
except to substitute one carrier for another,'' Crandall said.
   American already flies to Gatwick from Miami andDallas-Fort
Worth. Gatwick has fewer connections than Heathrow.
   If the deals are completed, United and American will both serve
London from Los Angeles and two New York airports - Kennedy and
Newark.
   American will also fly between London and Chicago, Boston,
Philadelphia, St. Louis and Baltimore, while United will also fly
between London and Washington, San Francisco and Seattle.
   American bought a Chicago-London route from TWA last December,
but the deal has not been finalized pending the outcome of
negotiations over Heathrow.
   It was United's purchase of Pan Am's routes that got American
dealing with TWA, Crandall said. ``When the United-Pan American
deal was announced, that raised our awareness and that raised TWA's
awareness,'' he said.
   American plans to help finance its purchase by issuing new
common stock during the first three months of 1991, Crandall said.
He did not say how large the stock offering would be but expected
preliminary registration papers filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission late this week.
   American's deal with TWA also gives it an option for TWA's
unused overseas routes a year after the deal is complete. Six to 10
routes are likely to be picked up, said Donald Carty, American's
executive vice president of finance and planning. He said the
routes to Italy, Spain and Portugal are the most attractive.

   Private deposit insurance funds have not
had a tremendous track record. Bank runs have brought down insurers
in Ohio and Maryland and now the collapse of a small Rhode Island
bank threatens another.
   Nonetheless, as Rhode Island regulators piece together the
remnants of Heritage Loan and Investment Co. - and the private
agency that insured it - proposals are being floated to spin off
federal deposit insurance to the private sector.
   Proponents say the idea is to reform a system that allowed a
debacle such as the savings and loan scandal.
   ``Our first line of belief is private insurance can handle the
whole thing,'' said Dwayne Welsh, general counsel of the National
Deposit Insurance Corp. of Dublin, Ohio. ``The way you're going to
solve this insurance problem is privatize this thing and charge
people (depositors) for the insurance.''
   Welsh, whose firm is the largest of 10 private insurers of
credit unions in the country, warns that without reform, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. - protector of Americans'
commercial bank deposits - could go the way of the now-defunct
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   He thinks the S&amp;L-like failures in Ohio, Maryland and Rhode
Island were anomalies created by criminal wrongdoing or by state
and federal regulators more intent on satisfying politicians'
demands than on policing an industry.
   A private company, he argued, would be insulated from that kind
of pressure to prop up a failing institution.
   His opinion is far from universal.
   ``People are just looking around for ways to bring market
discipline to the system and private deposit insurance is a thing
that a lot of academics have suggested,'' said Ellen Lamb of the
Conference of State Bank Supervisors based in Washington. ``It's a
good theory, but we've seen a lot of cases where it doesn't work.''
   The most recent case has been at Heritage Loan, a small
operation in Providence's Federal Hill neighborhood, the base for
New England organized crime.
   News reports have linked bank president Joseph Mollicone Jr.,
for whom an arrest warrant has been issued, with mob figures. But
law-enforcement authorities shy away from revealing details of
their investigations.
   Heritage's insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity
Corp., pumped cash into the bank. But that seriously drained
RISDIC's $25 million fund covering $1.6 billion in deposits at 35
credit unions and 11 banks in the state. Most of the members of
RISDIC since have applied for federal coverage, although some of
the credit unions are looking to Walsh's private fund.
   Peter Nevola, RISDIC president, said he believed his members
applied to the federal system ``reluctantly'' because state
regulators suggested that otherwise ``they would sometime down the
line have no insurance.''
   But he argues the Heritage crisis proved the soundness of his
type of fund. When its reserves dipped below 1 percent of all
member institutions' deposits, the banks and credit unions were
reassessed to replenish the capital and all Heritage depositors are
recovering their money. And no taxpayers are footing the bill, he
said.
   ``I think we're demonstrating that it's probably the best idea
yet,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the crisis has led Rhode Island leaders to wonder
whether the private insurance fund has outlived its usefulness and
whether federal coverage should be required.
   ``I think those kinds of questions are going to be asked again
this year,'' said Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, who conceded that simply
transferred potential problems onto the backs of taxpayers.
   ``That's who pays for most things around here,'' the governor
said.
   Business Regulation Director Frederick J. Franklin said he has
seen a trend away from private insurance to federal insurance.
   That was largely what happened after private funds in Ohio and
Maryland were seriously depleted by crises in 1985. But as Rhode
Island's small banks and credit unions look toward protecting their
deposits with the Treasury-backed funds, fundamental questions
about the soundness of the federal insurance are being debated.
   Three separate studies examining the health of the nation's
deposit insurance are to be completed during the next several
months. Reforming the existing system is likely to dominate the
next session of Congress.
   ``It's No. 1 on the agenda for the (House) Banking Committee.
Everybody's going to jump into it,'' said Tom Seppy, a staffer on
the panel's subcommittee regulating financial institutions, which
commissioned one of the studies.
   Either supplementing or replacing the existing funds with
private insurance is just one of the many ideas being offered, but
it is one that has aroused plenty of interest among people who
believe the government failed to safeguard taxpayers when the S&amp;Ls
spun out of control and took a big chunk of the Treasury along with
them.
   ``Currently the mood, if you will, on Capitol Hill seems to be
to find some way to limit the government's risk or exposure due to
bank failures,'' said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman in Washington.
``To this point, nothing is really being endorsed over another
idea.''

<HEAD>Pickens Says All His Koito Stock Pledged as Loan Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas financier T. Boone Pickens' Boone Co. says
all of the shares it holds in a Japanese auto parts maker are
pledged as security for a loan, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
   Boone, the largest stockholder in Koito Manufacturing Co., had
said in a report filed on Dec. 7 that an unspecified number of
shares were used as collateral for the loan from Japanese stock
speculator Kitaro Watanabe.
   Watanabe was the source of a large block of the shares.
   The Finance Ministry asked Boone to specify how many shares were
pledged as collateral.
   An official of the Finance Ministry's Security Bureau, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said the ministry received an amended
report Monday specifying that all of Boone's 26.4 percent stake in
Koito was used.
   Pickens has demanded seats on Koito's board of directors and
charged that the company is unfairly discriminating against foreign
investors.
   Koito has refused the demand for seats, saying it questions
Pickens' intention in buying the shares.
   Noting the report that all of the shares were used as security,
Tamotsu Aoyama, Koito's director and general manager, said, ``Our
claim was justified. Boone Co. isn't a real stockholder that bears
the responsibility for a risk.''
   Koito contends that Watanabe actually holds the shares, and that
Pickens is a front for a greenmail attempt. In greenmail, a
company, fearing a takeover attempt, pays a premium to buy out some
shareholders.
   Under a Japanese law that took effect Dec. 1, investors who
purchase more than 5 percent of the ttal shares of a public
company must report information such as the source of funds and
purpose of the investment to the Finance Ministry.

<HEAD>Government Clears Satellite TV Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday cleared a merger between
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting.
   Trade Secretary Peter Lilley said he would not refer the deal to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   The Conservative government's decision sparked criticism from
opposition parties.
   ``It is detrimental to the public interest that Sky should be
allowed to establish a satellite television monopoly without
penalty,'' said Labor lawmaker Robin Corbett, the party's spokesman
on broadcasting matters.
   Sky Television, which had four channels, and BSB, which had
five, announced the merger in early November to stem mounting
losses from both operations.
   The renamed, five-channel British Sky Broadcasting, is 50
percent owned by Murdoch's News International and 50 percent by
BSB's existing shareholders, the publishers Pearson PLC and Reed
International PLC, the entertainment company Granada Group PLC, and
the French conglomerate Chargeurs SA.
   Until the launch of Sky in 1989, Britain had four land-based
channels. BSB began operating earlier this year.

<HEAD>Documents Say Kerkorian Refused to Limit Chrysler Stake to 10
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California billionaire ignored Chrysler Corp.
Chairman Lee Iacocca's plea that he promise to limit his stake in
the automaker to less than 10 percent, documents say.
   Chrysler has tightened its anti-takeover provisions despite Kirk
Kerkorian's assurances he has no plan to seek control of the
nation's No. 3 automaker after buying 9.8 percent of its stock for
$272 million.
   On Monday, Kerkorian filed papers with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that said he bought about 22 million shares of
Chrysler stock during the last two months for investment purposes.
   In the filing, Kerkorian said he bought about 5 million shares
of Chrysler stock on Nov. 19 and met with Chrysler officials Dec.
9. At that meeting, he rejected Iacocca's request he sign a promise
not to acquire 10 percent or more of Chrysler stock.
   Following the meeting, Kerkorian bought 10 million shares in two
transactions, Dec. 10 and lst Wednesday, through his Tracinda
Corp., the filing said.
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said Monday that
Chrysler's board tightened its ``poison-poll'' provisions on Friday
in response to Kerkorian's stock purchases.
   ``I don't think the action of Mr. Kerkorian and the action of
the board are coincidental,'' Bidwell said.
   The board lowered to 10 percent from 20 percent the amount of
stock an investor may hold before triggering a provision offering
Chrysler stock to shareholders at a discount.
   That, in turn, prompted shareholder Arun Shingala of New York to
file suit in Delaware on Friday seeking to overturn the poison-pill
provision as harmful to shareholders' interests. He also asked the
suit be made a class action.
   Chrysler officials ``just seem very insecure to me,'' said Terry
Christensen, Kerkorian's Los Angeles attorney. ``Kerkorian and
Tracinda have offered to be consistently supportive of Lee Iacocca,
both before, during and after the furor.''
   Chrysler officials told The Detroit News the company last year
discussed business deals with Kerkorian, including his possible
purchase of its Gulfstream aircraft subsidiary.
   No deal materialized, the officials said in a story in today's
editions of the paper.
   Chrysler was the most active stock onm the New York Stock
Exchange with 1.88 million shares traded Monday. It closed at
$12.87{ a share, up 62.5 cents a share from Friday's close.
   Bidwell, in charge of Chrysler's car and truck operations, said
Chrysler has no idea what Kerkorian's motives may be.
   ``All we know is the track record of the guy,'' he said. ``We're
playing wait-and-see.''
   Kerkorian, a 73-year-old billionaire, last month sold MGM-UA
Communications Co. for $1.3 billion to Italian financier Giancarlo
Parretti. He is also known for his investments in airlines and Las
Vegas hotels and casinos.
   In the past, he has bought the companies, sold off divisions or
subsidiaries, and then sold the organization, making millions of
dollars along the way.
   Kerkorian said in the SEC documents that he has no plans for
``an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger,
reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its
subsidiaries.''
   Kerkorian also said he has no plans to boost his Chrysler
holding beyond 9.8 percent, but noted he may increase or decrease
his holding depending on general economic, money and stock market
conditions.
   Analysts recently have viewed Chrysler's stock as undervalued.
At $12 a share, Chrysler is valued at about $2.7 billion, just a
shade more than Ford Motor Co. paid for the British luxury car
maker Jaguar PLC early this year.

<HEAD>News Sues Unions Over Interference With Dealers, Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News has sued its striking unions on
charges they have used violence to disrupt the publication and sale
of the newspaper.
   The News on Monday accused the unions of violating federal labor
law in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   It was the second lawsuit brought by the newspaper against the
unions since the strike began Oct. 25.
   The first lawsuit, brought Nov. 29 under the civil racketeering
statute, accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a violent
conspiracy to force a favorable labor settlement or the sale of the
newspaper.
   The new complaint claims the unions violated the
Labor-Management Relations Act, which prohibits unions from
interfering with the business of parties not involved in a labor
dispute.
   ``The defendants and agents acting on their behalf have mounted
a campaign of violence and intimidation against the News' dealers
and advertisers in an effort to disrupt the publication and sale of
the newspaper,'' the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit asks for more than $50 million in losses the News
claims it incurred as a result of the campaign, which it said
included ``many hundreds'' of incidents of arson, assault,
vandalism, threats and harassment.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor attorney and adviser to the unions,
denied the allegations. He cited recent testimony by senior police
officials who said investigations found the violence was committed
by individuals and was not part of a coordinated conspiracy.
   Kheel said the News' lawsuits against the unions constituted
``harassment.''
   He said ``the suits will, if successful, destroy the unions or
come close to destroying the unions by the cost in time and money
the unions will have to spend defending themselves.''
   The News has published every day during the strike, but the
majority of the city's 12,000 newsstands and vendors have stopped
selling the paper and many major advertisers - such as Macy's,
Alexander's and A&amp;S - have pulled their accounts.

   International Business Machines Corp. and
Cummins Engine Co. were the top corporate donors to charity in
1989, according to a survey.
   IBM, which contributed $135 million to charity in 1989, gave the
most money, while Cummins Engine was first in percentage of pretax
income. The Indiana diesel maker's $3.4 million in contributions
last year represented 16.5 percent of net income before taxes.
   Public Management Institute of San Francisco listed the top
givers among U.S. businesses in its second annual ``Generosity
Index.''
   Among dollar leaders, Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto was
second with $74.5 million in donations, and General Motors was
third with $62.2 million.
   Behind Cummins in percentage leaders was Adolph Coors Co., which
donated $4 million, or 15.6 percent of 1989 pretax income. Safeway
Stores Inc. of Oakland was third with $14 million in contributions,
or 14.9 percent of pretax income.
   Despite a looming recession, Public Mangement Institute
President Kenneth Gilman predicted contributions will remain steady
this year. He said most companies have told PMI their 1990
contributions are about the same or a little higher than last
year's.

   Regulators, bankers, politicians and
economists agree: The fast-fading government fund that guarantees
bank deposits will soon need an infusion of billions of dollars to
keep it alive during a recession.
   But they are vigorously debating who should be the donor.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady says the banking industry
is healthy enough to bail itself out, and he got backing Monday
from L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
   ``Any strengthening of the Bank Insurance Fund can and should be
financed by the banking industry, not by the American taxpayers,''
Seidman told the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions.
   Banking's problems do not amount to another savings and loan
crisis, he added.
   Subcommittee members, with memories of voters' reaction to being
forced to pay for the $500 billion S&amp;L debacle, generally welcomed
his words.
   ``We need to make certain that the taxpayers of this nation ...
are not asked to bail out the banks,'' said Rep. Frank Annunzio,
D-Ill., the panel's chairman.
   However, several other members noted a similar determination
within the Reagan administration regarding S&amp;Ls and wondered if it
would be better to face up to hard truths now.
   ``You only have two choices. You pay a little now or a lot
later,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Seidman is advancing a plan that would transfer $24 billion to
$25 billion into his fund by assessing banks a fee equal to 1
percent of their deposits. He also would raise the industry's
annual insurance premium to $6 billion, nearly triple last year's
rate.
   That should be enough to handle failures in all but a deep and
long recession. In that case, the FDIC could borrow from the
Treasury, Seidman said.
   In addition, Seidman suggested that some weak banks be permitted
to remain open under tight supervision by regulators, a tactic
known as forbearance that was adopted successfully to handle
troubled farm banks in the mid-1980s.
   ``If economic conditions continue to erode, we must ... explore
means to reduce losses and improve credit availability by
preventing failures. We cannot let weakness in the financial system
bring on recession or worse in the economic system,'' Seidman said.
   However, three economists who prepared a study on the health of
the insurance fund for the subcommittee said forbearance would
allow bank managers to take a chance on resurrection by gambling
with deposits.
   ``It could be that forbearance would work. ... But it's a
high-risk gamble. A very high-risk gamble,'' said Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution.
   He and his colleagues, James Barth of Auburn University and R.
Dan Brumbaugh of San Francisco, said it is better to inject
taxpayer money into the insurance fund so failed banks can be
closed promptly and consolidated into healthier institutions.
   Lita and Barth favor a loan from the Treasury to the fund, to
be repaid by banks if they are able. Brumbaugh said surviving banks
should not have to repay the money.
   Seidman estimated his fund will lose $4 billion this year and $5
billion next year, when around 180 banks will fail. That would
reduce reserves to $4 billion - to guarantee $2 trillion in
deposits - by the end of next year.
   ``Our best assessment of the situation is that the Bank
Insurance Fund remains solvent, and will be solvent at the end of
1991. But it is very weak,'' he said.
   ``Refunding should be in place before it is actually needed. In
other words, action should be taken early next year,'' Seidman
added.
   The economists say even a mild recession likely would produce
bank failures through 1993 costing $31 billion to $43 billion,
enough to bankrupt the fund. A severe recession would cost up to
$63 billion, they said, a figure Seidman called too low.

   Christie's International PLC plans to eliminate
146 jobs following a 50 percent drop in its autumn season sales,
the auctioneer said Tuesday.
   Christie's said it would lay off a tenth of its worldwide work
force, from clerks to art experts, over the next few weeks.
   The company said in a statement that it also would freeze the

   Christie's sales sank to $645 million in the months of August to

   Chairman Lord Carrington said that Christie's has ``decided to
take prompt action to reduce our cost base significantly enough to
weather the current climate, but in a way which will not erode our
ability to take full advantage of the next upturn in the market.''
   Despite the sales dip, Carrington added that the medium- to
long-term prospects for the company and the art market were
encouraging as a whole, particularly in continental Europe and
Asia.

   Is 1991 the year we learn how high Mario
can jump?
   ``Mario,'' that high-stepping hero of video games, has helped
Nintendo of America Inc., remain the top toy in America for the
past three years. But how will Nintendo hurdle a recession?
   Some toy experts think the video game craze has peaked, at least
in its latest incarnation. But even if sales do fall off, they say,
Nintendo won't vanish from the scene, especially if it launches a
planned new entertainment system next year.
   Executives at Nintendo's North American headquarters here say
the Nintendo Entertainment System now is in nearly one out of every
three U.S. households.
   This year, they estimate, Nintendo and its licensees will sell
$4.1 billion worth of game systems, cartridges and related
products. That's $1.4 billion more than in 1989.
   Nintendo of America, a subsidiary of Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd.,
has more than 80 percent of the entire U.S. home video market.
Nintendo projects the entire U.S. video game industry will tally
$5.1 billion in sales for 1990, a $1.7 billion gain over last year.
   Toy and Hobby World magazine has listed Nintendo's game machine
as the nation's top-selling toy since January 1988. Last month, the
trade magazine also listed four other Nintendo products in its top
10: The ``Super Mario Brothers 3'' game as No. 2, the Game Boy
hand-held set at No. 4, the ``Tetris'' game in sixth place and
``Super Mario Brothers 2'' at ninth.
   Nintendo won't make its 1991 forecasts until after the Christmas
season, spokesman Tom Sarris said.
   But a shaky economy and the prospects of poor retail sales this
Christmas don't add up to good news, says analyst Paul Valentine,
of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   ``There's no question, the signs are unmistakable that the video
game fad is slowing down,'' he says.
   Valentine notes that some video game cartridges are now selling
for $20 apiece when they sold for $35 or $40 a year ago. Sales of
the game sets also are down, with Nintendo predicting it will sell
7.5 million units this year, compared with 9.1 million in 1989.
   ``Nintendo has been sizzling for the past few years,'' Valentine
said. ``It's unrealistic to think that sort of momentum to support
video games will go on indefinitely.''
   David Leibowitz, an analyst with American Securities Corp. in
NewYork, disagrees.
   ``Taken as a totality, Nintendo will be the biggest seller this
year. This Christmas will do nothing to diminish the appeal of the
line,'' he said.
   Sure, times are tough, Leibowitz said, but ``the children of
America will not be denied.''
   Toy retailers are hedging their bets. The Child World chain has
slashed prices, Kay-Bee stores has offered 10 percent discounts,
and Toys ``R'' Us has held a $100 million clearance.
   Sales for the Nintendo game system have slowed, but demand for
the games and for Game Boy is strong, said Angela Bourdon, a Toys
``R'' Us spokeswoman.
   Though older game cartridges such as ``Zelda'' and ``Punch Out''
are included in the clearance, ``the hot ones like Super Mario
Brothers 3 have not been discounted,'' Bourdon said.
   Peter Main, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing,
says things may be tougher this holiday season, ``but Christmas
still happens.''
   Nintendo games are ``big value items'' - stuff that gets played
with beyond Dec. 26 - which should strengthen its appeal to
money-tight consumers, Main said. He also noted that the last video
game boom, led by the Atari system in the early 1980s, came in the
middle of a recession.
   To help boost first-quarter 1991, Nintendo is launching a major
new game, ``Startropics,'' the day after Christmas, Main said. The
game is a fantasy adventure similar to past hits ``Legend of
Zelda'' and ``Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.''
   Main said Nintendo also has been targeting adults more in its
marketing, with people over 18 accounting for 50 percent of the
hardware purchases this year. Game Boy especially is a hit with
adults, he said, and new games such as ``NES Play Action Football''
and ``Dr. Mario,'' a sequel to ``Tetris,'' were designed to appeal
to older players.
   Nintendo, which employs about 1,500 people in this Seattle
suburb, is betting on its future with plans for a
300,000-square-foot automated warehouse on a 110-acre site in North
Bend, about 25 miles east of Seattle. The warehouse, to open early
next year, will double Nintendo's plant space in the Seattle area.
   Valentine and Leibowitz said Nintendo could recharge its
business with a planned new entertainment system, a 16-bit machine
that offers substantially better graphics, sound and action than
the current 8-bit device. The new machine was launched in Japan
this fall and was well received, Leibowitz said.
   Nintendo's main competitors, Sega and NEC, already have 16-bit
players on the market.
   Main said Nintendo has been criticized for the past two years
for not bringing out the new machine. But he said Nintendo didn't
want to do that while demand remained high for the older
entertainment system. Existing Nintendo game cartridges can't be
played on the new machine.
   Sarris said Nintendo ``is looking at the second half of 1991''
to introduce the game, but no specific date had been chosen.
   Valentine said even if video games fade, Nintendo won't vanish.
He said he has made predictions before that Nintendo would suffer
the same fate as other fads in the volatile toy industry.
   ``I've always felt that the history of the toy business is
cyclical,'' he said. ``I've been maybe 18 months early predicting
the end of the video game fad while Nintendo was laughing all the
way to the bank.''

<HEAD>Japanese Business Lending Hand To Soviets Despite Official Chill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese businessmen are extending a tentative
lifeline to the ailing Soviet economy even though their government
has avoided wider ties pending resolution of a long-standing
territorial dispute.
   A number of companies have signed contracts or worked behind the
scenes to aid the Soviets' herculean task of converting to a
market-oriented economy, experts say.
   ``If Gorbachev is ousted and perestroika fails, it will be a
very big setback, so some politicians and corporations have decided
they must help it succeed,'' said Hiroshi Kato, a professor at
Tokyo's Keio University who specializes on the Soviet economy.
   Kato said these groups feel it's in their best interest to help
even though there has been no breakthrough in a dispute over a
group of islands north of Japan seized by Moscow at the end of
World War II. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is widely expected
to make a major concession on the islands when he visits Tokyo next
spring.
   ``If perestroika fails,'' Kato said, ``Japan will have to help
with refugees fleeing from Siberia. Inflation will become terrible
and cause a complete economic failure.
   ``And then the Japanese will have to pay even more than now to
bail the Soviets out.''
   Foreign Ministry officials say the business community has not
applied direct pressure on the government to drop recommendations
against expanding contacts with Moscow before the island dispute is
resolved. Still, Tokyo appears to be going along.
   ``The government is doing what it can to help the Soviets, and
the private sector is doing what it can,'' one senior ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
   While Japan continues to rule out official financial aid to the
Soviets until the islands are returned, it is providing some
emergency medical relief.
   And major Japanese trading houses and banks are carefully
finding ways to help Moscow that won't entangle them in
unprofitable trade deals, experts say. Trading companies also seem
to have abandoned their traditional fear that doing business with
the Soviets will lead to harassment by extreme right-wing groups.
   ``It is natural for the Soviet Union and Japan to consider more
cooperation,'' said Yohei Mimura, chairman of Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan's largest trading house. ``We should do what we can to help
ensure the survival of perestroika in this historical age.''
   Mitsubishi recently signed a $300 million contract to build 18
cargo ships for the Soviet shipping firm Sovcomflot.
   Mitsui Busan, another major trading firm, said it reached a
preliminary agreement with the Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas
Industry for two offshore oil and natural gas projects near the
eastern Soviet island of Sakhalin. The project will provide the
Soviets with offshore oil extraction technology and boost Soviet
petrochemical exports, the company said.
   In mid-November, five commercial banks agreed to lend the Soviet
Union $400 million to buy steel pipes and pay for goods already
imported from Japan, industry sources said. The loans will be
guaranteed by trading houses involved in Japan-Soviet trade.
   Seiji Tsutsumi, head of the Saison Group of retail and travel
companies, says he is writing a book with other major businessmen
to help the Soviets follow the Japanese example of rebuilding after
the war.
   The two-year-old Soviet policy of allowing 14,000 enterprises to
make their own deals with foreign companies without going through
the central government has bred great confusion.
   ``No one knows who's in charge. In the past, you could depend on
the government to back up Soviet firms, but now you can't trust the
system,'' said Michitaka Hatori, economist at the Japan Association
for Trade With the Soviet Union and Socialist Countries of Europe.
   Soviet businesses also have been told to become self-sufficient
because they can no longer rely on the state to bail them out.
   Foreign creditors have been unwilling to come to the rescue of
ailing Soviet firms, and as a result some exporters have stopped
shipments to the Soviet Union.
   Estimates of unpaid Soviet trade debts to Japan range from
several hundred million to as much as $1 bilion.
   When Soviet companies sought delays of up to nine months to pay
for steel from Japan, supplies were cut off until a partial payment
was made, Japanese officials say. Matsushita Electric Co. started
requiring advance payment for exports after Soviet buyers fell
behind in payments.
   Direct trade fell 6.4 percent in the first nine months of 1990
from the corresponding period a year earlier because of such
embarrassments.
   ``If you read the newspapers, it looks as if a lot is going on.
But it's not trade,'' Hatori said.

   Digital Equipment Corp. has found some
technical problems in its new line of mainframe computers,
prompting the company to retrofit the machines to make them more
reliable, a spokesman said today.
   Digital unveiled its VAX 9000 machines last year, entering the
mainframe market that has been dominated by rival International
Business Machines Corp.
   But some customers have reported troubles with the machines,
which are designed to handle massive amounts of information.
According to Digital, the problems caused the machines to ``crash''
every few days in certain applications.
   Mark Steinkrauss, director of investor relations for Digital,
said the problems arose in a ``handful'' of customers who run the
machines for lengthy periods.
   He said many customers did not experience the trouble, although
Digital expected there might be some problems when the company
introduced the machine.
   ``It would be unrealistic to think you're not going to get a
glitch here or there,'' he said.
   David Lynch, a Digital spokesman, said the enhancement was being
made on all VAX 9000s. ``It's important that they be at top
reliability,'' he said.
   Lynch said Digital did not consider the situation a serious
problem.
   The company has been looking to the VAX 9000 to help boost weak
revenues that led to Digital's first-ever quarterly loss earlier in
the year.
   Some analysts say the VAX 9000 has been hurt by production
delays, although the company insists the machines are being
well-received.
   ``This is a headache, but not a disaster,'' said Terry Shannon,
a consultant with International Data Corp. ``Digital is bending
over backwards to make sure these things run right.''
   Michael A. Guider, a vice president at Litel Communications
Inc., a regional long-distance carrier in Worthington, Ohio, told
The Wall Street Journal that the retrofit ``eliminated a serious
problem that had plagued our machine.''
   But Guider also praised Digital's support and said the retrofit
would not disrupt his operations.

<HEAD>Two Comedy Channels to Merge

<TEXT>
   Two all-comedy cable services that have battled
each other since April Fool's Day said today they are ending their
war of the chuckles and merging into a single cable network called
Comedy TV.
   Home Box Office's The Comedy Channel, begun in November, 1989,
and MTV Networks' HA! The Comedy Network, on the air since April 1,
will start their merged service early next year, company officials
said..
   Each is a 24-hour operation, and each has faced difficulties
getting onto cable systems due to a shortage of available channels.
   They made it official less than than a month after two proposed
rival cable services devoted to law - ``In Court'' and ``American
Courtroom Network'' - also said they would merge into one service
called American Courtoom Network.
   Time Warner Inc., which had hoped to launch one of the all-law
networks, owns HBO.
   The Comedy Channel is seen in 8.5 million homes. HA!, whose
parent company is owned by Viacom International Inc., is in 6.5
million homes. Their union will give the new service 15 million
homes, they said.
   All-sports ESPN serves the most cable homes, 55.9 million,
followed by Turner's Cable News Network, which serves 54.4 million.
   The advertiser-supported Comedy TV Network that will result from
HA! and The Comedy Channel will be a 50-50 venture, with a
programming lineup drawn from each network, the two companies said.
   Each network will continue its respective operations until the
new service begins ``in early 1991,'' HBO said.
   The president of the new network will be recruited from outside
the two companies, and the new network will be staffed by HA! and
The Comedy Channel employees.
   HBO chairman Michael Fuchs, in a statement, said the merged
comedy service ``is not only a very positive move for both
companies, but should have a salutary effect on the cable industry
as a whole.''
   About 12 new cable services plan start-ups in coming months,
according to one estimate by Erica Gruen, a cable analyst at
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. The hopefuls range from a 24-hour
talk show channel to the Cowboy Channel.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit, hurt by a
huge foreign oil bill and an unexpected surge in car imports,
climbed to $11.61 billion in October, the biggest imbalance in
almost three years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said both U.S. exports and imports hit
all-time highs, leaving the October deficit a giant 24.5 percent
higher than September's deficit of $9.33 billion.
   The country's October trade performance surprised economists who
had been looking for the number to remain virtually unchanged. Some
analysts said the sharp deterioration would make the start of the
new recession even more severe than had been expected.
   Economists said the October report suggested that what had been
the one bright spot in a lackluster economy, a narrowing trade
deficit, would not be available to help cushion the start of the
downturn in the October-December quarter.
   They also said the big rise in imports suggested that retailers
will be stuck with bloated inventories which could dampen
production and make the length of the downturn last longer.
   ``This is a bad number,'' David Wyss, an economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill, said of the October trade gap. ``It suggests that
we are not going to get as much help from net exports as we had
hoped and it suggests there is more inventory out there than we had
thought.''
   Much of the deterioration came from a 17 percent jump in
America's foreign oil bill, reflecting the huge jump in world
prices following Iraq's August invasion of Kuwait.
   Oil imports rose to $7.23 billion in October, the highest
monthly total since April 1981.
   The total trade gap widened to its largest imbalance since a
$12.56 billion deficit in February 1988.
   U.S. exports climbed 8.6 percent, hitting an all-time high of
$34.77 billion.
   This increase was viewed as good news that America's export
boom, the source of much of the economy's strength in the past
three years, was continuing.
   But imports were up in October by an even larger amount,
climbing 12.2 percent to $46.38 billion.
   The big jump in oil imports reflected a rise in price from
$24.31 a barrel in September to $29.04 in October. The volume
imported actually fell slightly to 8.03 million barrels a day, down
from 8.48 million barrels daily in September.
   The other big increase in the import category came in shipments
of new cars, which soared 39 percent to $4.51 billion in October.
   In other economic news today, the Labor Department reported that
the cost of living rose a moderate 0.3 percent in November, the
first inflation break for consumers since oil prices shot up after
the invasion of Kuwait. The seasonally-adjusted increase in the
Consumer Price Index followed an increase of 0.6 percent in October
and even larger rises of 0.8 percent in September and August.
   The Bush administration had been hoping that the trade deficit
would drop below $100 billion this year for the first time since
1983. However, October's big surge left the deficit for the first
10 months of the year running at an annual rate of $103 billion,
down only slightly from last year's $109.4 billion deficit.
   As usual, the biggest deficit in October was with Japan, a $4.90
billion imbalance which was the largest since a deficit of $4.91
billion in October 1989.
   The deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner, rose
to $1.4 billion in October while the deficit with China was $1.2
billion and the deficit with Taiwan was $1.1 billion.

   The stock market bounced back in choppy trading
this morning after a modest drop on Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 8.17 points at
2,601.49 after an hour and a half of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 6 to 5, with 657 up,

   Volume on the Big Board came to 50.66 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   There was no dominant pattern to today's early trading, but
analyst Jack Solomon at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said traders seemed to
have been reassured by the latest inflation figures from the
government. The Labor Department said today that the Consumer Price
Index had gone up 0.3 percent in November, half of the 0.6 percent
increase in prices in October and far less than the increases of
0.8 percent in September and August.
   ``Today's a bit of a respite and a bit of a sigh fo relief that
the CPI didn't upset the apple cart,'' Solomon said. There was also
a sense in the market that diplomats were trying to find a peaceful
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis, he said.
   High oil prices brought on by the crisis have hurt stock prices
in many trading sessions.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   Grain and soybean futures prices drifted lower in
quiet trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as dealers
awaited official word on rumored sales of U.S. corn to the Soviet
Union.
   Grain prices ralled Monday on indications the Soviets may have
bought as much as 600,000 metric tons of corn, but as of this
morning there was no confirmation of any grain sales.
   Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said traders were hoping for an announcement to come
out of London, where U.S. and Soviet negotiators were meeting to
discuss terms of a U.S. food aid package.
   ``Something might come out of that, but so far it's just a
quiet, dull day,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to \ cent

   Live cattle were unchanged to .10 cent lower with the contract
for delivery in December at 81.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.20 cent lower to .18 cent higher with January at 89.10 cents a

<HEAD>Industrial Output In Eastern Germany Drops 50 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial output in Germany's five new
eastern states has dropped nearly 50 percent from 1989, the
Economics Ministry said Tuesday.
   The figures clearly show that the new eastern states remain in a
``serious restructuring process'' as they move from a centrally
controlled economy to a market economy, the report said.
   The industrial output dropped 35 percent from autumn of 1989 to
July and decreased another 14 percent from July to August, the
report said. However, output increased about 2.5 percent in
September and another one percent in October.
   The report attributed the slight improvement to a 9.5 percent
increase in energy production and a 21 percent increase in the
production of foodstuffs.
   No data was available to determine if the big drop of output in
the summer months was traceable to seasonal factors.
   It was also not clear whether the slight increase in production
was due to a re-orientation of consumers toward eastern-made
products after a rush to buy western products following monetary
union on July 1, the report said.
   Separately, the report said that new orders for production
dropped 15 percent in August from July and another 10 percent from
August to September.
   However, new orders for industrial products increased by 2
percent from September to October.
   East Germany's industrial output started sagging last fall when
tens of thousands of mostly skilled, young workers fled to the
west. The problem was compounded when the borders were opened,
giving easterners free access to better-quality western products in
former West Germany, which for the most part had been denied them
for four decades.
   After monetary union, when the West German mark became the
official currency, western products took over many shelves in the
east, further cutting demand for locally produced items.
   Experts have predicted that many of former East Germany's
outdated factories and other businesses will be forced to shut down
in the restructuring process, and that up to half of the estimated
8 million workers in the eastern states could be jobless by the end
of 1991.

   Agreement is near between the United States
and the 12 governments in the European Community on sales of $420
million worth of American corn and sorghum to Spain and Portugal, a
U.S. official said Tuesday.
   A four-year accord was due to expire at the end of the year and
would be renewed for another year, said an official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Renewal would remove a threat of retaliation by the United
States against a similar amount of Europeanexports to this
country.
   The proposal for a year's renewal was made to the 12 governments
Monday by the European Commission, their joint executive.
   The dispute arose when Spain and Portugal became members of the
Community, also known as the common market. Under Community rules,
the two new members were bound to give preference to goods from the
other members.
   President Reagan's administration protested that American
farmers would lose sales. So it was agreed that Spain and Portugal
would continue to buy an annual two million tons of American corn
and 300,000 tons of sorghum for the four years.
   Expiration of the agreement and retaliation by the United States
would have damaged hope for progress in the Uruguay round of trade
talks among more than 100 countries on a wide variety of products
and services. Negotiations were stalled earlier this month by a
clash between the United States and the Community over subsidies
for farm products.
   Another meeting has been called in Geneva, Switzerland, on Jan.
15 by Arthur Dunkel, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.

   Like a party reveler sprawled on the dance floor after too many
drinks, the American economy awoke to a sobering skull-thumper in
1990 from the indulgent 1980s.
   An addiction to foreign imports, corporate takeovers and debt
finally took its toll on the longest peacetime expansion in U.S.
history.
   The downturn, now official by almost any measurement, has put a
million people out of work since June and caused thousands of
companies to fail or seek shelter from creditors in bankruptcy
court.
   Homebuying and construction have fallen to levels not seen since
the last recession eight years ago. Banks are weak, the stock
market is sick, car sales are anemic, and consumers spent sparingly
for Christmas.
   ``People are postponing the postponable,'' said Jerry Jordan,
chief economist at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
``All over the place, people are just sitting on their hands.''
   The U.S. economy, built on the free enterprise forces of supply
and demand, is accustomed to cycles of boom and bust. But this
time, things are different. External shocks to the economy - from
the Persian Gulf crisis and the savings and loan bailout, for
example - are exacerbating the slide.
   The Gulf standoff has added a ``war premium'' to oil prices and
stoked the embers of inflation. The thrift bailout has added to the
already enormous debt burdens of the federal government and
increased the ultimate bill to taxpayers. Some experts worry that
the pressures are too severe for the economy to bounce back
quickly. A few expect the worst is yet to come.
   ``If somebody asked me not too many years ago whether we would
have a major downturn similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s,
I would have said no,'' said James Barth, a finance professor at
Auburn University in Alabama and a former economist at the
government's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   ``But now it's to the point where people are talking about it,''
Barth said. ``That registers on the economic Richter scale. I'm not
willing to say it just won't occur.''
   The hard times have inspired an aggressive hunt for scapegoats.
The highest flyers of the '80s - Donald Trump, Michael Milken and
S&amp;L fraud defendant Charles Keating - have become targets of
editorials and the butt of late-night TV monologues. The young
baby-boomers on Wall Street have been generally cursed for sapping
the productive energies of American businesses by weighing them
down with excessive debt.
   ``There's a fixation on trying to blame some people, some
institutions for excesses in which many of us shared,'' said Jerry
Sterner, author of an off-Broadway hit play about a hostile
takeover called ``Other People's Money.''
   ``I think Trump, Keating and the boys were a reflection of what
we were, taken to a much larger level,'' Sterner said. ``It's
easier to blame `them bums.'''
   The question for 1991 is not who's to blame, but where will it
end. What's going to happen to pull the economy out of its nose
dive?
   Amid the gloom, some suggest the comparisons to the '30s are
misplaced.
   For one thing, the economy is more diversified and efficient
than it was 60 years ago, strengthened by an array of systems to
transmit goods, services, knowledge and ideas that are the envy of
the world.
   For another, the Federal Reserve, the central bank, recently has
taken steps to loosen credit, rather than tighten as the Fed of the
1930s did. That classic blunder precipitated an avalanche of
failures because even healthy businesses couldn't borrow to pay
their bills.
   ``The Fed is keenly aware we're in a recession now,'' said David
Bostian, chief economist at Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York
investment firm. ``The Fed has woken up to the realization that it
needs to aggressively ease.''
   Some studies indicate the present downturn could be shallow and
short. The University of Michigan's forecasters predicted at their
recent economic outlook conference that growth would show a modest
decline in the final quarter of 1990 but revive in early 1991.
   The Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development released a surprisingly optimistic assessment in late
November that said the United States is facing a period of slow
growth, but not a downturn.
   Some economists suggest the national perception has been skewed
by heavy reporting of bad news on the East Coast, where the economy
is slowest.
   Meanwhile, Texas and its neighbors are rebounding, the West
Coast remains relatively healthy and an export boom is
strengthening vast parts of the Midwest, notably around the Great
Lakes, which could become the catalyst for the next national
economic resurgence.
   Milwaukee, for example, devastated by a loss of manufacturing
jobs during the 1981-82 recession, is thriving because factories
have since retooled with modern equipment. It is now one of the
nation's leading job producers.
   In Cleveland, once a recession-scarred industrial hulk and now a
model American city, companies learned the hard way to cut costs
through automation and smaller work forces during the 1980s.
   ``Running lean and mean, running scared, has become a way of
life,'' said Adrian Dillon of Eaton Corp., an electrical and
automotive component manufacturer that is one of Cleveland's key
industries.
   A recent study by the American Express Co. on the outlook for
small and midsized businesses, the main generators of new jobs,
showed companies in the Pacific states should fare well in a
recession, while those in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions
would be hit hardest.

   Some economists have dismissed recession talk altogether and
argue that the United States is about to embark on a period of
stunning growth. They base this outlook partly on the premise that
many U.S. companies are much tougher than they were just a few
years ago, battle-hardened by foreign competition and recent cost
cutting.
   John Rutledge, senior economist at the Claremont Economics
Institute, a forecasting concern in Claremont, Calif., contends the
yawning trade deficits American manufacturers agonized over last
decade masked a critical advantage they enjoyed: the availability
of affordable foreign machinery to modernize and get back into the
game of making money.
   ``A lot of turnaround stories of the 1980s were businesses using
imported machines to retool,'' he said. ``If you look at what we
imported, it wasn't all Hershey bars and Hondas. It was things we
used to build other things.''
   Now, Rutledge said, ``We have survivor managers, good managers.
The capital stock has been groomed and rebuilt. We're all dressed
up and ready for a party, if there's enough money to make that
happen.''
   Whether there's enough money is the key question.
   Federal government debt, driven by repeated budget deficits, has
risen more than 60 percent in the past five years to $3.25
trillion, or more than $13,000 for every American.
   Business debt has swollen just as dramatically, largelybecause
of the mergers, buyouts and restructurings of the last decade.
DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., an economic forecasting firm in Lexington,
Mass., said corporate liabilities totaled $2.2 trillion in 1990,
about double the figure of five years ago and triple the total in
1980.
   ``A very substantial portion of corporate cash flow, 35 to 45
percent, goes into servicing existing debt, a historic postwar
high,'' said Robert Hormats, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., a Wall Street investment bank. ``This means there is less
money available for new investment. It also means companies are
very vulnerable to interest rate increases or declines in
earnings.''
   On the personal level, debts have been inflated by the
proliferation of plastic to finance credit-card purchases. By
DRI-McGraw Hill's estimate, total consumer debt exceeded $735
billion in 1990, 42 percent more than the level in 1985 and 146
percent more than the level a decade ago.
   But the debt pileup has led to some natural corrections.
Businesses are increasingly using bankruptcy court to reorganize.
Federal figures show more than 725,000 bankruptcy cases flooded
into the system for the year ended June 30, double the number of
1981.
   A Morgan Stanley Group analysis of companies that borrowed
heavily in the 1980s shows a majority were stable businesses like
public utilities and food processors. Cyclical industries like
retailers increased their debt only modestly.
   That means the United States may be able to battle its debt
hangover ``much better than the merchants of gloom believe,'' the
Economist magazine recently speculated.
   Debt accumulation by consumers also is slowing along with
spending, suggesting that Americans may be making healthy
adjustments in their personal finances.
   Major banks, by putting billions of dollars aside as reserves
against loan losses, are demonstrating the discipline needed to
return to profitability.
   Even on Wall Street, which has been mired in a slump since the
crash of 1987, some say prices have fallen so far, they could be
poised for a rebound as investors look for bargains.
   A forecast from Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. says the Dow Jones
industrial average could double to 5,000 as early as mid-decade.

   Visions of pizza parlors danced in the heads of the managers at
Pantera's, a small Midwest restaurant chain that borrowed $65
million during the easy-money '80s to buy much larger Pizza Inn
Inc.
   But first they overvalued and then mismanaged the Dallas-based
chain of 600 restaurants. Morale deteriorated, training evaporated,
employees quit, franchisers pulled out.
   In October 1989, 2{ years after the leveraged buyout, Pizza Inn
couldn't pay debts and sought protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. New management was
appointed and creditors were paid. About 150 restaurants closed,
but today Pizza Inn survives.
   ``I was amazed at the opportunity this provides a company to
save the baby and not liquidate the whole thing,'' company
president Jeff Rogers said. ``The bankruptcy gave us a clean
start.''
   Pizza Inn is a parable for the 1980s, in which wide-eyed
managements exploited loose credit to expand via LBOs financed by
high-risk junk bonds. The moral is found in the company's recovery
under America's benevolent bankruptcy code.
   The term bankruptcy is derived from the Italian ``banca rotta,''
which means broken bench. In medieval times, if a trader couldn't
pay creditors, they smashed his trading bench. For centuries in
Britain, debtors went to prison.
   But U.S. bankruptcy law was designed to allow companies to rise
from the ashes of collapse. The belief that failure is a forgivable
outgrowth of entrepreneurship is considered uniquely American.
   The 1990s are putting that notion to test. An ailing real estate
market, LBO debts, tightening bank credit, increased foreign
competition and new legal tactics are straining the nation's
bankruptcy system as never before.
   Federal statistics show more than 725,000 business and personal
bankruptcies were filed in the year ended June 30, double the 1981
figure. Ten of the 25 biggest bankruptcies in history have occurred
in the last 18 months, Beard Group Inc., a Washington research
firm, reports. Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. says 55,000 businesses failed
in the first 11 months of 1990 - 165 a day.
   ``We just ran out of space in our file room in Phoenix for
1990,'' said Kevin O'Brien, clerk for Arizona's two bankruptcy
courts. ``If nothing happens soon we won't have anywhere to put
'91.''
   Arizona is inundated with bankruptcies stemming from the
collapse of the real estate and savings &amp; loan industries. Annual
filings have more than quadrupled since 1980, to a projected 18,500
in 1990. The state's five judges handled 216 Chapter 11 cases
apiece in 1989, three times the national norm.
   In New York, hand-written signs point to rooms containing the
files of big-name bankruptcies such as Eastern Airlines, Drexel
Burnham Lambert, Lomas Financial and Ames Department Stores. Boxes
of documents are stacked in hallways.
   Bankruptcy, ironically, has spawned a vibrant industry.
Corporate debt restructuring is one of the few growth areas at Wall
Street investment houses. ``Workout'' firms help companies
repackage debt to delay payments without declaring Chapter 11.
   Businesses even have sprung up to help manage the regulatory and
paperwork maze. Finding opportunity in others' misfortune,
speculators invest and trade in the debt of distressed companies.
   Law firms are bulking up what 10 years ago was a necessary but
unglamorous area. Many specialists in the field say bankruptcy law
is to the 1990s what mergers and acquisitions law was to the 1980s.
   ``It's a hot area because of economic necessity,'' said Alan
Miller, a partner at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotschal &amp;
Manges, which has the nation's largest bankruptcy group.
   The first permanent federal bankruptcy law was enacted in 1898,
but was based on the British model under which creditors forced
companies into liquidation to collect debts. The idea of using
bankruptcy to help companies survive wasn't enshrined in the law
until 1938.
   U.S. bankruptcy statutes remained unchanged for another 40
years, until Congress in 1978 overhauled the Depression-era laws to
account for the nation's more sophisticated business environment.
   Under the reform, business reorganizations of all sizes were
combined into Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Existing
management was allowed to run a company during bankruptcy instead
of a court-appointed trustee.
   But none of the reformers envisioned today's multibillion-dollar
cases with multiple tiers of complicated debt and more creditor
committees than teams in the National Hockey League.
   ``When I became a judge in 1973 I never heard of a junk bond,''
said Robert L. Ordin, who stepped down from the Los Angeles
bankruptcy bench in 1983 and now is with the law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb.
   The costs of reorganizing in bankruptcy court also have
escalated. A typical case spins off big paychecks for attorneys,
investment bankers and accountants. Those fees can siphon millions
of dollars from a debtor's estate that could otherwise be used to
pay creditors.
   ``The costs for big companies are simply off the charts,'' said
Stephen Weinroth, chairman of Integrated Resources Inc., which
staggered into bankruptcy court 10 months ago $1.6 billion in debt.
The financial firm expects to spend more than $50 million on
professional fees during its reorganization.
   Drexel is paying up to $18 million every three months to
professionals hired by three creditors' committees and a
shareholders' committee. Including those hired by Drexel, about 20
law firms, four accounting agencies and three investment advisers
are involved in the bankruptcy.
   Some judges are fighting back. In the Drexel case, Judge Howard
Buschman III slashed lawyers' fee requests by 25 percent. In North
Carolina, judges are forcing debtors and creditors to streamline
cases to save time and money for smaller companies.
   ``The Chapter 11 law was designed for the large corporation,''
said Judge A. Thomas Small in Raleigh, N.C., who has cut case
completion time to six months from the national average of 18 to 24
months. ``It just doesn't fit for small ones.''
   In a Chapter 11, companies continue operating but all debts and
other legal obligations are put on hold. Creditors fight with the
debtor and each other over who gets how much. Secured creditors
such as banks are first in line; shareholders typically are last.
The two sides negotiate and vote on a reorganization plan.
   But the process can be nasty. Bankruptcy disputes increasingly
are feeding a wave of legal wrangling that can prolong cases,
sometimes by years.
   ``It's become way too litigious,'' said Harry Dixon, chairman of
the American Bankruptcy Institute. ``Even as recently as five years
ago lawyers and judges got together and these things got settled
with a great deal less expense than today.''
   One increasingly popular method of speeding the process is the
prepackaged bankruptcy, in which the debtor and creditors agree on
a reorganization plan before declaring Chapter 11. Southland Corp.,
owner of 7-Eleven stores, is in a prepackaged bankruptcy now.
   ``It cuts down on the amount of fees and costs involved. Judges
love them,'' said Thomas Salerno, a Phoenix lawyer who shepherded
sign-maker Kroy Inc. through a prepackaged bankruptcy in six
months.
   But new techniques alone aren't enough. Demand is growing for
reform and more judges. Experts predict the number of Chapter 11
filings to increase as more companies fail to honor debt
obligations.
   About $23 billion in high-interest junk bonds went into default
in 1990, said Richard Lehmann, editor of the Defaulted Bond
Newsletter, a Miami Lakes, Fla., trade publication. Another $50
billion is expected to default in 1991 and 1992.
   ``There's a lot of this stuff out there and we don't know how
it's going to shake out,'' said Nathan C. Thorne, head of
restructuring at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``It's like a snake just
swallowed a great big animal.''

   For stock-market investors and people who work
in the securities industry, it hasn't been easy to see much bright
promise in the early days of the 1990s.
   Stock prices have spent most of 1990 in a bear market that
surpassed the Crash of 1987 in duration, if not in severity.
   At the same time, Wall Street itself languished in the fourth
year of a stubborn industry slump.
   The end-of-an-era signals in 1990 seemed hard to miss. In
February the firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, kingpin of the '80s
junk-bond boom, abruptly collapsed and disappeared from the scene.
   Nine months later its foremost financier, Michael Milken, drew a
10-year prison sentence.
   But in the midst of these backward-looking events, many analysts
argue that the ground is being cleared and the seeds being sown for
more bounteous times in the investment world as the decade
progresses.
   ``The economy has tumbled into a serious recession,'' said Erich
Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New
York. ``The financial structure is at risk. Even so, the year ahead
could be surprisingly good for Wall Street.
   ``With an assist from the Federal Reserve, we expect the economy
to rebound during the second half of 1991. This has exciting
implications for financial markets.''
   To put a number on his optimism, David Bostian at Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co. forecasts that the Dow Jones industrial average
will climb to 5,000 as early as mid-decade.
   ``This recession is providing painful, but valuable, lessons to
governments, corporations and individuals that will improve their
economic conduct in the 1990s,'' he maintains.
   ``The new decade will see savings and investment favored
relative to consumption and equity favored over debt, to cite only
two critical changes.''
   Like many optimists in other areas of the economy, Wall Street's
bulls are counting on the present crunch ultimately to serve as a
purgative and restorative, rather than destructive, force.
   One central theme in this kind of argument is that the debt mess
of the 1980s, with all the problems it has caused, will be cleaned
up before too long, but not forgotten.
   Says Bostian, ``I think the banks may have learned a
long-to-be-remembered lesson on the importance of lending for
productive economic activity rather than financial speculation.''
   What is more, some observers argue, a reborn distaste for credit
excess is likely to help foster a long-lasting decline in interest
rates.
   ``Now that recession is clear to everyone, anxiety about
inflation will evaporate,'' contends Robert Barbera, economist at
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``Back-to-back decades of low inflation are likely to break the
back of inflationary expectations. As a consequence, interest rates
should decline more than inflation, as `real' rates fall as well.
   ``For investors who spent the past 10 years in money market
funds or certificates of deposit, the collapse of high real rates
on cash instruments is not good news.
   ``We believe that to obtain higher returns in the 1990s,
investors will need to accept the volatility associated with stocks
and bonds. And these of course would benefit from such a change in
strategy.''
   Whether they accept such reasoning or not, some analysts suspect
there is more pain to be endured before any party gets started.
   To establish a bona fide bottom to the bear market, they assert,
investors in greater numbers will have to be driven from the scene
in discouragement or disgust.
   This ``never again'' mood is not yet manifest in such important
arenas as mutual fund activity. Indeed, through the first 10 months
of 1990, while the stock market was sagging, investors snapped up
$56 billion in new shares of stock mutual funds, challenging a
record of $67 billion set in 1987.
   At past market bottoms, hardly anybody wanted any part of stock
funds.
   Observers looking for extremes of pessimism say the requisite
gloom is much easier to find, however, within the securities
industry itself, where talk abounds that the good days are forever
gone.
   Aside from the business of money management, executives in the
brokerage business these days seem hard-pressed to find any facet
of their operations that promises much money to be made.
   ``Wall Street has been through its own private recession for the
past three years,'' says Heinemann. ``Firms have cut back. They
have pared their costs.''

   Not so long ago Americans were carefree
consumers. Armed with credit cards, they went cheerfully into debt,
satisfying needs and whims with few worries about the future.
   But the broadening recession has made once-spendthrift shoppers
timid, as evidenced by a sharp downturn in spending. Yet some
observers see a silver lining to these hard times and say consumers
may emerge as wiser and more demanding customers.
   ``If consumers start retrenching and saving more, that might
make more money available for investment,'' which could stimulate
the economy, said Sandra Shaber, an economist with Futures Group in
Washington.
   The slowdown in consumer spending may just be a mixed blessing.
   ``It's bad in the sense that it's going to aggravate the
downturn in the economy in the short-term,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, a senior adviser with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., a
forecasting concern in Lexington, Mass. ``But in the long-term, a
lot of families have been loaded with debt, and they need time to
make an adjustment.''
   Still, consumer spending - which accounts for two-thirds of the
gross national product - must remain buoyant enough for the economy
to recover.
   Over the past few months, growth in consumer credit has dropped
sharply. In October, consumer credit was growing at an annual rate
of 2.4 percent, down from a 4.6 percent growth rate in September
and 5 percent in August.
   A year earlier, Americans were taking on debt much more freely.
Credit rose at an annual rate as high as 6 percent in August 1989.
   ``The great heyday when consumers were borrowing even more
rapidly than what their income growth was came in '86,'' Ms. Shaber
said. But for the next two years debt continued to grow but at
about the same pace as income, and since the beginning of 1990, it
has fallen behind the rate of income growth, she said.
   Ms. Shaber attributed the recent slippage in consumer debt to a
slowdown in income growth that began in 1989 and continued into
this past year. ``People have less money to spend and they're going
to buy less,'' she said.
   Other factors also have helped bring consumer spending levels in
line with income. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which phased out the
deduction for most consumer debt, made some Americans realize they
had to take a more responsible attitude toward spending.
   Many consumers have put spending on non-essentials such as
clothing, furniture and appliances, on hold as the unemployment
rate climbs and the Middle East crisis looms as a huge uncertainty.
   The reluctance to spend money in department and discount stores
has forced retailers to become more lean by cutting their
inventories and buying less merchandise. With less demand for goods
at U.S. factories, production is down, and that has meant layoffs
for hundreds of thousands of workers in recent months.
   It doesn't end there. Consumers who are not working have even
less money, so they are scaling back spending and the cycle begins
all over again.
   Harry L. Davis, a professor of marketing at the University of
Chicago Graduate School of Business, found another silver lining:
People, having little money to waste on goods that wear out or
break down easily, are becoming better consumers.
   They ``have learned how to say, `No, this quality isn't high
enough,''' Davis said.
   A consumer's decision to put off a big purchase ``may be the
result of being to some extent better informed and wanting to buy
things that are going to be longer-lasting values,'' he said.
   This growing sophistication among consumers is putting pressure
on U.S. manufacturers to come up with better ideas and products.
   Automakers must now market their cars based on durability and
safety instead of image, while ``McDonald's is spending a lot of
time grappling with consumer demands for healthier food,'' Davis
said.
   Manufacturers are not the only ones having to shape up.
   Retailers, facing tougher competition for fewer consumer
dollars, must come up with better merchandise at the right price.
They have to improve customer service and make their stores
convenient and attractive.
   ``The consumers are providing more challenge to companies,''
Davis said.

<HEAD>Bush's Higher Taxes, Saddam's Higher Oil Hits Families Hard</HEAD>

   If you read the lips of George Bush and Saddam
Hussein in 1990, you're probably wondering how you're going to pay
the oil and tax bills this coming year.
   Those two elements of the economic equation suddenly turned into
wild cards, but the news isn't all bad.
   Higher taxes, for one, could help trim the U.S. budget deficit,
which many economists call the main problem. Others fear a bigger
tax bite will hamper economic expansion.
   Higher oil prices might revive energy conservation, but it seems
doubtful they will last. The Persian Gulf crisis also has prompted
the government to speed efforts at developing a national energy
policy.
   But in the short run, the higher tax and fuel bills won't be
much fun for anybody except perhaps the tax collectors and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``Consumers have to cut back on their spending because they're
spending more money on fuel and heating oil,'' said Edwin S.
Rothschild, of Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group.
``Businesses are having to spend more and people are being laid
off. The airlines are having a hard time.''
   Rothschild estimated that before this cold season ends, the
average household that uses home heating oil will have to pay
between $300 and $500 more to keep warm.
   Consumers also were paying about 30 cents a gallon more for
gasoline as the year drew to a close. Experts pointed out, however,
that when inflation is taken into account, fuel prices were much
cheaper in 1990 thn they were in the early 1980s, when the
aftershocks of the Iranian revolution pushed oil prices higher.
   Regardless, the effects of the expensive oil will ripple through
the economy, which is already running into hard times.
   ``It is a major contributing factor to the recession that we are
entering,'' Rothschild said.
   Although many economists and Wall Streeters were proclaiming a
recession throughout the fall, the government carefully avoided
uttering what has become known as the dreaded ``R-word.''
   The administration's deeds spoke louder than words, however,
when Bush abandoned his ``read my lips'' pledge of no new taxes.
The government instituted a sweeping package of higher taxes on
income, gasoline, cigarettes and liquor.
   The gasoline tax increase of 5.1 cents a gallon added to the
burden of higher fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
Economists say it will hit working people and the poor hardest.
   During 1990, Americans had to work full-time from Jan. 1 to May
5 before they had paid off their entire tax burden, according to
the Tax Foundation, a Washington watchdog group.
   It's too early to pinpoint the date of ``Tax Freedom Day'' for
1991, but the foundation estimates it will be pushed back again.
   ``It really can't help but make it even worse,'' Tax Foundation
spokesman Bill Ahern said. ``The only thing that could prevent the
day from getting worse would be a phenomenal economic recovery for
1991 that doesn't seem to be in the cards. If you look at the taxes
... they are substantial.''
   Many economists see the tax burden as a bigger threat to the
family budget than expensive oil, because oil is plentiful despite
the Gulf crisis.
   In December, OPEC ministers agreed to reinstate production
quotas once the turmoil ends, but oil analysts predict the cartel
will have a tough time executing that plan.
   The American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry trade
organization, said if crude prices come down and stay down, the
prices of refined petroleum products will have to follow.
   As 1991 progresses, it could reveal whether the United States
has changed any of its energy priorities after suffering the oil
shock of 1990.
   The Energy Department is expected to release a long-awaited
energy strategy that will include expanded uses of alternative
fuels as well as proposals for drilling for oil in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.

   After years of haggling with the Third World
over unpaid loans, commercial banks began a new decade with a new
crisis in their own backyard.
   A recession, higher oil prices, sagging real estate markets and
growing corporate debt put the industry in more red ink over the
past year. Many were forced to tighten lending, cut dividends, lay
off staff and restructure operations to stay afloat.
   ``I'd say the banking industry is probably overall in the worst
shape it's been since we've been rating banks in the early 1970s,''
said Christopher Mahoney, a banking analyst for Moody's Investors
Service in New York. ``We have more troubled banks, more large
troubled banks, than ever before.''
   While others agree, they say current problems aren't likely to
escalate into another savings and loan fiasco. Nor are they making
many comparisons to the 1930s, when the list of bank failures was
as long as bread lines.
   In fact, some say a healthy dose of cost-cutting and lending
discipline could rejuvenate the industry.
   ``We have weathered this kind of storm before and we will
weather this one as well,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
recently.
   Stephen Berman, banking analyst with County Securities USA in
New York, agreed: ``This is a troubled industry coming to grips
with its problems.
   ``They're establishing reserves for the (weak) real estate
cycle, which will cause losses this year and next year. (But) they
will be stronger.''
   Experts recall the real estate recession in the mid-70s, the
collapse of the oil states and the rust and farm belts a few years
later, and the Third World debt crisis in the last decade.
   Banks dumped billions of dollars into special reserves to cover
losses from developing countries, whose deteriorating economies
forced them to put off or halt bank loan payments. By the start of
1990, big banks had amassed reserves to cover, on average, about
half their total loan exposure, according to a Moody's report.
   Just as they did with Third World debt, banks have set up
reserves or written off troubled real estate loans.
   By Sept. 30, these loans made up 61 percent of the nonperforming
loans of 23 large bank holding companies studied by
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Loans that are
nonperforming may be delinquent or in default.
   During the third quarter, bank earnings slid 29 percent over the
previous quarter, according to the latest data from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., itself under financial strain.
   The FDIC report noted, however, that 89 percent of the nation's
12,400 commercial banks made money in the quarter and that the
money losers were largely comprised of banks in the
recession-plagued Northeast. But it said that was likely to change
by 1991 as more banks, particularly on the West Coast, report
problems with real estate loans.
   Two-thirds of the nation's loan officers admitted to tightening
lending standards on construction and land development loans, a
recent Federal Reserve survey found. About a quarter restricted
credit for residential mortgages by requiring higher down payments
and bigger household incomes.
   ``Consumers can still get money, unless they're
over-leveraged,'' County Securities' Berman said.
   Overleveraging, or piling up more debt than one can easily
handle, was the name of the game during the '80s, and banks were
all too eager to accommodate the binge. But the buying spree ended
as the economy worsened.
   ``Banks are recognizing that maybe they did go beyond the bounds
of conservative lending,'' said Charles J. Orabutt, a vice
president at Duff and Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Bad loans from highly leveraged transactions made up 12 percent
of the nonperforming loans of the 23 banks surveyed by
Prudential-Bache in the third quarter. Some experts predict that as
many as 20 percent of highly leveraged companies will require some
form of debt restructuring.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. charged off $35 million of a loan to an
unnamed ``highly leveraged corporate borrower'' in the third
quarter. Analysts believe it was a reference to cash-strapped
developer and casino owner Donald Trump, who restructured some of
his bank loans.
   Banks scaled back foreign operations while consolidating and
strengthening domestically to save money and to meet stricter
standards for capital reserves, which take full effect in 1993.
   Citicorp, for instance, announced a major reorganization just
before the holidays that included laying off as many as 8,000
employees and cutting its dividend to shareholders by 44 percent.
The nation's largest bank also decided to close two-thirds of its
commercial real estate and corporate banking offices in North
America.
   Security Pacific Corp. eliminated its entire merchant banking
division, which lent money to large corporations and underwrote
securities overseas.
   Chase reduced its staff by about 5,000 and halved its dividend,
while Chemical Banking Corp. slashed its dividend 63 percent.
   ``Through the 1990s we'll see most banking companies concentrate
on establishing strong domestic operations,'' said Robert Dugger,
chief economist for the American Bankers Association trade group.
   Dugger also predicted more bank marriages of convenience.
   ``I suspect there will be many mergers of banks to economize on
their operations - interstate and intrastate - and improve
profitability,'' he said. ``This consolidation process will
continue through the 1990s.''

   The Big Three automakers have fresh management
teams and their employees have new contracts, but don't be fooled:
The U.S. auto industry is facing old problems requiring action.
   Car and truck sales tumbled in 199, profits fell and the
specter of losses reappeared. Blue-collar workers wondered weekly
if they would be at home or on the assembly line. The industry was
declared to be in a recession.
   In a climate of unprecedented competition that includes Japanese
companies building cars in the United States, executives and labor
union leaders are looking for new ways to make money.
   ``We are facing ... an extremely competitive struggle which is
not going to go away,'' Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz said.
``The economy can turn around, but the Japanese transplants and the
offshore producers will still be there.''
   ``We've got to tell the Fords, the Chryslers, the Hondas, the
Nissans that we've got a product for them,'' said Joseph
Hasenjager, union president at a General Motors Corp. brake
component plant in Dayton, Ohio. ``That's the only way you get job
security.''
   Union and management leaders are hopeful that new three-year
contracts between GM, Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. and the
United Auto Workers will create harmony and avoid disputes that
could further hurt the industry.
   The contracts cover more than 450,000 active autoworkers. The
companies have committed billions of dollars to provisions for full
wages for workers laid off from plants closed because of sales
slumps.
   ``It is essential that we retain the good will we have,'' Ford
President Philip Benton said. ``The contract has reinforced that
atmosphere.''
   The industry will need all the good feelings it can muster - and
more - to reverse losses in market share.
   At the end of November, the Big Three held just over 70 percent
of the U.S. car and truck market to about 24 percent for Japanese
automakers. In 1989, GM, Ford and Chrysler had a 73.7 percent share
to 22.4 percent for the Japanese.
   The industry appeared to be ready for a recovery in the late
summer when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Oil prices skyrocketed, and car
and truck sales fell. In the last three months of 1990, the Big
Three companies are expected to record their first quarterly loss
since 1981.
   ``Profits are under enormous pressure in North America, and they
started out from an abysmal level,'' Benton said.
   Analysts expect Big Three profits to fall about 75 percent in
1990 from $8.4 billion the previous year. That means intensified
competition for the fewer car and truck buyers.
   GM's is making the challenge from Spring Hill, Tenn., site of
its Saturn car project. The seven-year, $3 billion effort is aimed
directly at the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla.
   But car buying tanked as the first car rolled off the assembly
line. Executives predicted that up to one-third of first-year sales
would come from owners of other GM vehicles.
   Saturn's quality control resulted in far fewer cars being
shipped to dealers than expected. Some dealers, who had invested
millions in Saturn, were asked to delay openings or had only one or
two cars on the showroom floor.
   It didn't make for good public relations in an industry that has
stressed vehicle quality, recognizing the reputation of Japanese
automakers for reliability.
   Management shakeups also are part of the Big Three's hopes for
revival.
   Within 10 hours of officially succeeding Roger Smith in GM's top
job, Robert Stempel unveiled a new management structure. At Ford,
Harold Poling took over from Donald Petersen, but only for three
years.
   At Chrysler, vice chairman Gerald Greenwald took early
retirement to head a union effort to buy United Airlines. The bid
failed, but Greenwald still received a reported $9 million.
   As the industry worried about the erosion in Americans' devotion
to American cars, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca faulted Greenwald
for leaving the struggling automaker.
   ``He grew up with me. He'd been in the car business for 32
years, same two companies as me - Ford and Chrysler,'' said
Iacocca, who delayed his 1991 retirement plans. ``Isn't there
anything sacred anymore? Isn't there any loyalty to anything?''

<HEAD>After Billion-Dollar Losses, Steel Industry Rebuilds To Rebound</HEAD>

   Ten years after a flood of low-cost imports
devastated America's steelmakers, one of the nation's historic core
industries is competitive again.
   ``It took a great deal of pain and suffering, but the industry
is now awake and in some cases remarkably astute and smart,'' said
John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia.
   The pain came in the form of 200,000 job reductions, hundreds of
mill closings and billions of dollars in spending to increase
efficiency. The gain is evident in falling imports and rising
profits.
   Lower production costs and a weaker dollar have boosted American
steel's competitiveness. U.S. steelmakers now produce a ton of
steel in about 5{ man-hours, lowest in the world and nearly half
the time it took in 1980.
   Still, the United States remains the world's biggest steel
importer. Foreign rivals - especially Japan and the European
Community - aren't standing still.
   ``The Japanese already were further ahead and they're running at
a much faster pace,'' said Hans Mueller, an economics professor and
consultant at Middle Tennessee Stae University. ``The Americans
are just catching up.''
   In the first nine months of 1990, imports comprised about 17
percent of the U.S. steel market, making America the world's
largest importer, according to the American Iron and Steel
Institute, a Washington trade group. Most imports came from Europe
and Japan, followed by Canada, South Korea, Brazil and many other
countries.
   The EC and Japan are the world's leading exporters of finished
steel. The United States exported about 4.6 million tons in 1989,
far less than the top exporters.
   The relative value of international currencies, more than
anything else, will determine the global competitiveness of
American steel in the 1990s, said Charles A. Bradford, a metals
expert for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
   ``The steel industry may be the biggest beneficiary of the
weakness in the dollar,'' he said. ``The biggest cost of an
integrated steelmaker is wages. If you compare wages around the
world, it's all a matter of the value of the dollar.''
   The United States was the dominant force in the international
steel market following World War II and led the world in steel
production in the 1950s.
   But Japan and European countries rebuilt their postwar
industries from scratch using modern technology. As U.S. mills
rusted, imports cracked 15 percent by the 1970s and reached an
all-time high of 26.4 percent in 1984.
   American steelmakers lost about $11.9 billion from 1980 to 1986,
when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200,000 workers
nationwide left the payrolls.
   The picture is brighter now. Steelmakers made about $1.5 billion
in profits in 1989. The cost of halting production while plants
were modernized was a major factor in 1989 and will continue to
hurt profits.
   ``The cost of modernization is taking its toll, but in the long
run they're much better off,'' Bradford said. ``This is what you
need to do if you want to be competitive.''
   In 1980, about 20 percent of American steel was made in modern
continuous casters, which turn molten steel directly into slabs,
skipping costly and time-consuming steps.
   Today about 66 percent of American steel is made that way and
the figure is expected to reach about 90 percent by the year 2000,
said Sheldon Wesson, a spokesman for the American Iron and Steel
Institute. In 1989, Japan made about 94 percent of its steel and
Belgium about 91 percent in continuous casters.
   ``The effort goes on. Nobody is satisfied,'' Wesson said. ``The
industry says it has spent in the last 10 years perhaps half what
it would have liked to spend on mill modernization.''
   ``You look at the profit picture and you wonder where the next
billion is going to come from,'' he said. ``This is all
self-financed. This is all pulling yourself up by the boot
straps.''

   A city that relies on the auto industry
to avoid the recession gripping the rest of America? It's happening
in Nashville.
   Economists said this Southern city took its economic lumps early
and has settled into a period of stability as other regions are
forced to retrench. The consolidation and weeding out already has
occurred.
   ``I think what has happened in Nashville is that the boom growth
levels have slowed down,'' said William Fox, an economist at the
University of Tennessee's Center for Business and Economic
Research.
   ``And in that sense, Nashville might have taken its economic
lick early,'' he said.
   Leading the way in Nashville are a budding automotive
manufacturing industry, a diversified services sector and an early
brush with negative growth economists said.
   ``Construction, for example, took a beating (in 1989) and a
little into (1990),'' Fox said. ``But at a time when manufacturing
is generally going down, Nashville is being held up by the auto
industry, which is kind of odd.''
   Car and truck sales and industry profits dropped in 1990, but
two big manufacturers have chosen sites near Nashville for new
factories on which they are pinning hopes for buoyant sales.
   General Motors Corp. built its $1.9 billion Saturn Corp. plant
in Spring Hill, about 40 miles south of Nashville. The plant and
its more than 3,600 employees and 700 contract workers began making
the car in October.
   More than 3,500 people are employed by Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. in Smyrna, about 25 miles southeast of
Nashville.
   Nissan is in the midst of an $490 million expansion that will
add 2,000 production jobs for total employment of 5,500 by 1992.
The expansion will raise Nissan's Smyrna investment to $1.2
billion.
   GM embarked on the seven-year Saturn effort to develop a car
that could compete with the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota
Corolla.
   Saturn is in the early production stages and has not yet reached
full output, unlike aging plants that automakers are closing
elsewhere in the country.
   ``Nissan and Saturn don't look like they'll be a factor in
recession,'' Fox said.
   ``(Saturn) intended to start slowly. Nissan is still in its
expansion mode, so they are not influenced by the business cycle,''
he said. ``They very well may be influenced three years from now.''
   Nissan plans to build 165,000 Sentras at Smyrna in the 1991
model year. The plant has a production capacity of 180,000 cars a
year, Nissan's manufacturing president Jerry Benefield said.
   The Japanese automaker, which also produces light pickup trucks
in Smyrna, will add a third vehicle line - which has not been
disclosed - with theexpansion.
   Nashville also is weathering the decline facing other big cities
because of a broad and ``recession-proof'' services sector of
insurance companies, hospitals and the headquarters of Hospital
Corp. of America.
   ``It has a nice diversified economy, and it's very well
located,'' Fox said. ``This place is very well situated for growth
and there's no reason to worry about it.''

   Viewed as a mechanical structure, the U.S.
economy needs retooling, reconditioning, rebuilding. Parts have to
be rehoned, bolts and rivets tightened, and the whole works needs a
lube job.
   It hasn't collapsed like the Soviet system, and it isn't likely
to do so. It doesn't need junking either, because nothing better
has been invented to replace it. But it is badly worn, abused by
the greed and grind of the 1980s.
   The greatest erosion was from debt, and the Resolution Trust
Corp. has the job of liquidating or selling off hundreds of
collapsed savings and loan associations, with the total bill
conceivably reaching $600 billion.
   Throughout 1990, banks were forced to write off billions of
dollars in failed corporate deals, and loans with real estate
developers and Third World nations. The total bank bill could only
be surmised, but the extent of the damage was illustrated when just
one, Chase Manhattan Corp., took a $1 billion charge against
earnings to cover bad debts.
   One of the oddest twists in the credit disaster was that banks
themselves found it difficult to raise money; bankers, accustomed
to hearing tales of woe from would-be borrowers, had worse problems
of their own. Chase, the nation's second largest commercial banking
enterprise, was forced to offer 13.017 percent to sell $200 million
of notes. Citicorp, parent of the largest bank, suffered the
indignity of having its own credit rating lowered.
   Industrial companies, many loaded with debt, showed the strains.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. found that dividend increases in 1990 fell
to their lowest levels in 20 years, 23 percent fewer than in 1989.
The payout money just wasn't there.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that in the first 11 months of 1990,
55,000 companies failed, up 19 percent from 1989. Also disturbing
was that the size of liabilities was up sharply, indicating that
more large companies were filing for protection from creditors.
   Nearly every industry was affected by failures. Failures among
real estate companies, which floated the debt; among financial
institutions, which helped them raise the funds; and among
insurers, which bought the high-yielding debt, rose more than 30
percent.
   What was the extent of that corporate debts? This:
   -Nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago.
   -In the late 1980s, half the funds raised by nonfinancial
corporations came from debt issues, with the other half from equity
offerings. But as recently as the 1960s and 1970s, the average was
only 24 percent debt.
   -In the 20 years through 1989, the ratio of interest expense to
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent.
   Since the market plunge of 1987, securities firms had been
shrinking their own businesses - disbanding departments that had
helped arrange takeovers and junk-bond offerings, laying off
workers and closing entire offices. The pace quickened in 1990.
With the economy sinking, deal-making was done, and rather than
Christmas bonuses, many high-paid employees received pink slips.
   Consumers were in debt, up to the limit of their Visa cards or
the caps on their home equity loans. Personal bankruptcies rose 15
percent in 1990, and would likely rise again in 1991. Late in the
year home mortgage delinquencies also rose.
   Uncle Sam, of course, remained in debt, unable to balance his
budget. By some estimates, the budget deficit could exceed $300
billion in the coming year. This, after a tortuous round of
so-called budget trimming.
   Economic growth inevitably succumbed to such impossible
circumstances, and the big question now is how deep the downturn
will be. The consensus of forecasts, including that from the White
House, is that any recession will be shallow and brief, probably
ending during the summer.
   However, many of the forecasts come with a caveat - that never
in the post-World War II era have similar conditions been
encountered. Forecasters point to the rickety condition of the
financial underpinnings and ask if those loans can be repaid in an
orderly way; or whether the structural rivets will give way.
   Clearly, a new era is here. In the old era, credit was cool; in
the new, debt is dumb. Businesses seeking to rid themselves of debt
are offering lenders equity instead. RJR Nabisco Inc., taken
private in the biggest debt-financed buyout ever, offered just
before Christmas to trade stock and cash for some of it
high-yielding junk bonds.
   Lenders are biting the bullet and writing off loans that once
they claimed were still collectable. Consumers are cutting
consumption.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady hinted that legislation
affecting banking would be on the agenda for 1991. The
administration of President Bush, he said, was committed ``to
promoting legislation and encouraging regulations that will allow
banks to reshape their activities to operate profitably and soundly
in business environment made new by technological changes.''
   Meanwhile, businesses and households are seeking to cut waste,
work more productively, and get those bills paid. In short, America
is banking on a return to the old verities - chief among them the
exercise of common sense.

   Hard times could put a squeeze on research and
development spending by U.S. businesses, but experts warn against
cutbacks that divert Americans from the global technology race.
   ``It's an easy but foolish place to cut,'' said Richard Shaffer,
editor of Technologic Computer Letter, a computer industry
newsletter.
   Despite gloomy talk, many experts say U.S. scientists and
engineers continue to make breakthroughs in a variety of fields and
hold their own in a number of technologies.
   ``I don't think we're any less innovative and creative than we
were 20 years ago, even though some people think we're becoming
soft and the Japanese are going to run over us,'' said Donald
Wilson, an assistant professor of management at Rochester Institute
of Technology.
   Still, some financially struggling companies have little choice.
   ``It's self-defeating in the long run, but if you're worried
about surviving this year you don't worry about the long run,''
said David Wyss, research director of the economic consulting firm
DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
   The need for U.S. companies to maintain research and development
spending is especially acute in light of stepped-up research
efforts by Japanese companies, particularly in this country.
   In recent years, many Japanese high-technology companies have
opened U.S. research centers, to which they attract U.S. scientists
with high salaries. Japanese companies also have boosted research
spending at U.S. universities.
   Wilson said these moves are an admission that the United States
is a hub of innovation. ``We're seen as kind of the creative
leaders,'' he said.
   U.S. companies overall spend more than twice as much on research
and development as their Japanese counterparts, but a smaller
amount as a percentage of gross national product.
   Japan's Science and Technology Agency says that nation's
research and development spending equaled about 2.85 percent of its
GNP in 1989, compared with 2.53 percent in the United States.
   In 1990, U.S. corporate R&amp;D spending is expected to total about
$108 billion, with $35.7 billion of that coming from the federal
government, the National Science Foundation says.
   As for the year ahead, a trade group called the Industrial
Research Institute is optimistic. Its survey of 137 major
research-oriented companies shows 41 percent plan to spend at least
6 percent more on R&amp;D than in 1990. Only 16 percent expect a
decline.
   But, the group notes, ``The respondents' combined R&amp;D as a
percent of sales is not expected to change from 1990 to 1991. A
sluggish economy, therefore, would restrain actual R&amp;D spending
increases.''
   The National Science Foundation says it began detecting a drop
in annual growth of R&amp;D spending by U.S. companies as early as
1986. Such spending grew 4 percent to 10 percent a year in the
early 1980s after adjusting for inflation, but fell to 2 percent to
3 percent a year since 1986, the group says.
   ``One of the main reasons was simply a slowdown in sales and
profit expectations,'' said foundation spokesman John Jankowski.
   An additional drag on corporate R&amp;D spending has been the
decline in the federal defense budget, he said.
   Some xperts believe the recession will force U.S. companies to
change the emphasis of their research.
   ``I think they will try and do more with less, which really
means we will see a substantial focusing down. Peripheral areas or
(research with) longer-term horizons will disappear,'' said G.
Steven Burrill, director of high technology for Ernst &amp; Young, the
accounting and consulting firm.
   David Methe, another Rochester Institute of Technology
management professor, says the real danger in a recession is that
U.S. companies may lay off research workers. These employees
represent ``repositories of knowledge and receptors of knowledge
from outside'' that could not easily be replaced, he said.
   Experts say they don't expect the recession to have the same
impact on R&amp;D in Japan, where companies are said to have a much
longer-term focus.
   ``I see them going the other direction,'' with increased
research spending, Burrill said.
   While the total amount of U.S. corporate research spending is
important, experts say they are equally concerned - if not more so
- about the ability of U.S. companies to turn innovations into
products.
   U.S. companies have long excelled at basic research, but have a
spotty history of capitalizing on these breakthroughs in the
marketplace. That is an area in which the Japanese appear to have a
clear lead.
   ``When you look at almost any product, the basic work of it was
done in the U.S. and Europe, and when the products came out they
were Japanese, whether it's CDs or video tapes,'' said Wyss.
   Experts trace part of the reason to the greater number of
engineers in Japan as a percentage of the population than in the
United States. Another factor they cite is that Japanese research
is often more pragmatic and product-oriented.

   It was the year Manhattan apartment prices
actually went down and some California builders, staggering under
unsold inventories, gave away a new car with each house sold.
   In Florida, new homes and condos sat empty because retirees
could not sell their homes up North. Would-be home sellers in
affluent New York suburbs slashed asking prices by $100,000 and
more, and still no takers.
   It was the year when Lucille Ball's mansion in Beverly Hills -
an enclave where common economic trends aren't supposed to apply -
sat unpurchased even after the asking price was cut from $7.8
million to $5.6 million.
   It was the year in which even the red-hot Seattle market turned
as cool as the squalls off Puget Sound.
   In short, it was a time when regional weaknesses in home sales -
the Northeast since the stock market crash of 1987, the oil states
before that - threatened to engulf the country in a national real
estate recession.
   Or at least both coasts. In many parts of the South and Midwest,
home prices and sales levels have remained at more modest levels.
   Sales were up 3 percent during the first 11 months of 1990 at
RE-MAX of Northern Illinois, said Betty Hegner, the president of
the operation with 116 offices and nearly 2,000 agents.
   ``I have to say, there are some markets where there definitely
is a softening of the market, especially during the last quarter,''
she said.
   Expensive homes, those priced above $200,000, were selling
slowly recently, in part because their owners won't reduce prices,
she said. ``But we have a lot of bright spots, too. We think it's a
good time to buy.''
   Even on the coasts, was it a recession or merely the end of a
cycle? That was still unclear in many regions. Take the Northwest,
where few could believe that 1989 and early 1990 sales and prices
could long be sustained, any more than the increases in California
in 1988 could go on forever.
   ``We had phenomenal appreciation,'' said Maria Bunting,
executive vice president of Windermere Real Estate in Seattle.
``For a real estate agent, it was as good as the wildest dreams of
what they would like it to be.''
   By spring, houses flooded the market as prices peaked. Buyers
pulled back. Sellers panicked. And home prices began to fall over
the summer.
   ``It was an adjustment period,'' Ms. Bunting said, describing
the region as now having a normal buyer-seller balance.
   Lower prices brought home ownership closer to millions of
people. National Association of Realtors statistics showed a
decline from July to October of $98,300 to $92,800 in the median
price of a home, the price at which half of the sales were for
more, half for less.
   Jill and Robert McCarty saw both sides of the equation and
figure they came out ahead. The couple - he an accountant and she a
manicurist - bought their dream house in December - a four-bedroom,
2,100-square-foot new home with a three-car garage in Saugus, an
outer suburb north of Los Angeles.
   They sold their first home, a ``fixer-upper'' they bought six
years ago for $105,000 in the working class Sun Valley area of Los
Angeles, for $207,000.
   ``We listed it at $229,000, which would have been the fair price
a little while ago, but after two weeks we dropped the price when
we saw what was happening,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, they returned to the tracts in more comfortably
middle-class Saugus and found builders cutting prices and throwing
in extras with abandon.
   ``We had been looking for two years up there, and couldn't find
anything we could afford,'' she said. ``So when the market got
slow, we said let's see what we could do. We got a $310,000 home
for $250,000.''
   That price included $5,000 in closing costs paid by the builder
and another $5,000 in luxury carpet.
   ``We're never moving again,'' McCarty said. ``We would never
have been able to do it if the market hadn't been like this.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders waited in vain for
confirmation of rumored sales of U.S. corn and soybean meal to the
Soviet Union.
   Trading volume was light and the session was ``relatively
dull,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Prices rallied Monday amid talk that the Soviets were looking to
buy as much as 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and 100,000 metric
tons of U.S. meal, using credit offered last week by the Bush
administration.
   But no official confirmation of grain sales surfaced during
Tuesday's session. Lespinasse said traders were hoping for new
developments from London, where U.S. and Soviet negotiators were
meeting to discuss terms of the aid package.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.51} a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.25 a bushel; oats were
2{ cents to 4 cents lower with December at $1.06{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 5{ cents lower with March at $5.83\ a
bushel.

   The Federal Reserve Board announced today it
was lowering its key bank lending rate from 7 percent to 6.5
percent, effective Wednesday.
   ``Action was taken against the background of weakness in the
economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary
aggregates,'' the announcment said. ``The reduction, in part,
realigns the discount rate with market interest rates.''
   The Fed said the board acted on requests from Fed banks in
Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,
Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas.
   The vote was 6-0.
   A decrease in the Fed's discount rate often signals that other
short-term loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages and car loans
also will become less expensive.
   It was the first change in the discount rate since the central
bank raised it from 6.5 percent on Feb. 24, 1989, and the first
reduction since August 1986.
   The discount rate epresents the interest the Federal Reserve
charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions.
   The board acted on the same day its monetary arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, met behind closed doors to consider whether
to ease credit conditions.
   The reduction also came amid signs the already weak economy may
be sliding into a recession. The Fed began boosting the rate three
years ago to slow the economy and thus dampen inflationary
pressures.
   As evidence mounted that the economy was becoming dangerously
weak, the central bank slowly eased short-term rates that peaked in
the spring of 1989.
   The Bush administration had been pressuring the central bank to
ease interest rates aggressively in an effort to lessen the
severity of the recession that many economists think has begun.

<HEAD>Mail Order Company Faces Difficult Rebound During Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR L. SRB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lands' End Inc. is performing a
difficult juggling act this Christmas: Like most retailers, the
company is trying to keep its sales buoyant despite the recession,
but it's also gambling on new merchandise lines and a new marketing
scheme aimed at expanding and reinvigorating its business.
   The catalog giant, known for its turtleneck shirts, denim jeans
and soft-sided luggage, ran in the red for the first three quarters
of its current fiscal year following a disastrous Christmas 1989.
The firm is resting its hopes for a rebound on a shift in its
strategy.
   After selling for years through a general catalog, one that
included all of its stock, Lands' End is putting out specialty
catalogs featuring particular lines, such as men's shirts and ties,
children's wear or bed and bath products.
   The company has also expanded its main catalog to add novelty
gifts and pet products including a $75 pillow for dogs and a $10
brass silent dog training whistle.
   Analysts said the strategy is positive and appears to extend the
firm's reach into upper class markets already served by two big
Lands' End competitors, Spiegel and L.L. Bean.
   The new approach also delivers products more efficiently to
traditional customers by creating special catalogs for consumers
with special needs, the analysts said.
   ``This company is not changing from polka dots to stripes.
They're seeking to raise their appeal level to core customers,''
said Paul Shain, vice president of research for broker Robert W.
Baird and Co. in Milwaukee.
   Richard C. Anderson, Lands' End's president and chief executive
officer, agreed with the analysts, predicting significant sales
boosts from the specialty catalogs and their new products.
   He said the company would update its styles with new colors and
fabrics, but does not plan any radical fashion changes.
   ``We are classic and simple and generally understated,''
Anderson said. ``It's our belief that classic clothing will never
go out of style.''
   Lands' End, founded in 1963 in Chicago, initially supplied
sailboat hardware and equipment by mail. But in 1976, the company
changed its focus to leisure clothes.
   While the company is enthusiastic about its new strategy, it is
tempered somewhat by the fact that it will difficult to increase
sales while consumers are cutting back their spending in a weak
economy.
   ``They need to expand and they're moving in that direction. But
when the economy's lousy, people are cutting back on purchases,''
said Marsha Raley, an analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.
   For the first nine months of this year, sales rose 9 percent to
$374.6 million, but Lands' End recorded an operating loss of
$259,000.
   The company has blamed its troubles in part on the consumer
spending slowdown that has afflicted most retailers.
   ``We saw some fairly early signs of the recession,'' said
Anderson. ``We experienced some softness in sales. It was something
we couldn't do a heck of a lot about.''
   Lands' End also lost money because of the costs of selling off
large inventories after a disappointing Christmas 1989.
   A year ago, the company overestimated its sales and ended up
saddled with $85.7 million in inventory, up 28 percent from the
year before. Lands' End was forced to liquidate much of the
overstock at bargain prices and at the expense of its profits.
   The company declined to comment on how it is doing so far in the
current quarter.
   With the new strategy, the company's success will depend
somewhat on its ability to forecast sales with greater accuracy and
avoid being caught with too large an inventory, said Liz Armstrong,
an analyst with Johnson Redbook in New York.
   The company's slump this year has been a disappointment for the
3,200 residents in Dodgeville, the rural community nestled in
southwestern Wisconsin where Lands' End located its sprawling
facilities in 1979.
   ``There won't be any profit sharing this year; there aren't any
profits to share,'' said Hank Van Epps, an electrician and one of
hundreds of Dodgeville residents who work for Lands' End.
   Company officials said it's too early to estimate profits for
the current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31, since the fourth
quarter's holiday sales will determine how well Lands' End fares.

   The stock market spiked higher today following a
surprise announcement that the Federal Reserve was cutting a
critical lending rate.
   Prices languished until the final hour of trading and then
soared on news that the Fed was lowering the discount rate by 0.5
percent to 6.5 percent.
   The change in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges on
loans to banks and other financial institutions, marked the first
time the rate has moved lower since August 1986.
   Although economists had been calling for an easing of credit to
bolster the stumbling economy, the announcement was a surprise
because it came while the financial markets were still open.
   Analysts lauded the Fed action. The Fed ``has got to get this
economy turned around,'' said Gene Jay Seagle, a vice president at
Gruntal Financial Inc. He likened the move to lighting a fuse that
would allow money to flow into the stock market.
   ``This will put a cap on what was developing into a pessimistic
attitude toward stocks,'' he said.
   But other market watchers were more skeptical over how much of
an impact a half a percentage point cut can actually make. ``The
immediate response in the economy will be long delayed, and we're
going to have to slug through some very difficult quarters in
'91,'' said Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``This does not signal the end of the recession by any means,''
he added.
   Traders had hoped that today's Labor Department report showing
the Consumer Price Index advanced a moderate 0.3 percent in
November would give the Fed impetus to ease credit.
   The report indicated inflation was being held in check, giving
the Fed more leeway to ease rates without fanning the fires of
inflation. But traders still were surprised by the timing of the
move, which came while the Fed's policy making arm was holding a
private meeting in Washington.

<HEAD>Accounting Rule Change Leading to Cutbacks in Retiree Health
Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board that makes the nation's accounting
rules has approved a far-reaching change in the way businesses
report health-care costs for retired workers, a move spurring
companies to reduce retiree benefits.
   The new rule, which takes effect in 1993, requires companies to
subtract from their annual earnings a portion of the costs of the
benefits they have promised to future retirees.
   Experts say a handful of large companies already have instituted
cutbacks in retiree health benefits to reduce the rule change's
financial impact on their earnings statements.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, a federally sanctioned
body that sets the standards for how companies report their
financial condition, approved the change Dec. 7, said FASB project
manager Diana Scott. The board gave preliminary approval to the new
rule in October.
   Scott said detailed copies of the rule change will be made
publicly available beginning Friday.
   ``There's going to be a lot of (cost-cutting) in the next 2-3
years,'' said Dale Yamamoto, a group actuary with Towers Perrin, a
benefits consulting firm.
   Previously, businesses reported only the current year's outlays
for retiree benefits in what was commonly called a ``pay as you
go'' basis.
   But the accounting profession argued that this gave investors
and other company stakeholders an inaccurate picture of a company's
financial health by understating what their long-range obligations
actually were.
   The new rule does not require companies to set aside money for
future retirees. But it has the potential to slash billions of
dollars from companies' financial earnings in the short term,
hurting their appeal to investors, experts say.
   At the same time, it may help their long-term performance by
forcing them to prepare for a fiscal future darkened by the rising
cost of health care.
   Health care costs have been increasing at annual rates of about
14 percent for many large companies, consultants say, far exceeding
the nation's inflation rate. For companies with particularly large
numbers of retirees, such as automakers and steelmakers for
example, the benefit obligations are enormous.
   For many future retirees, the rule-change is generally not good
news. Benefits consultants say that companies that have already
moved to reduce their health care costs include TRW, American
Airlines, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Pillsbury.
   While businesses do not have to start subtracting projected
retiree benefits until their 1993 financial statements, many
already have taken measures because ``the magnitude of the
obligation has gotten a lot of companies to focus on what they have
promised and to amend that,'' said FASB's Scott.
   The options that companies have instituted or are considering
include having future retirees share the cost of paying for health
benefits, requiring them to use cost-containing health management
organizations, and relating the contributions retirees kick in to
their number of years with the company.
   In the latter instance, workers who have worked more years would
pay less.
   Another, more drastic cost-saving measure companies are
exploring is capping the total amount paid per year in medical
benefits to each retiree.
   Other companies may simply choose to report a significant
liability on their balance sheets, but that option is not expected
to be widely used.
   ``Some companies are very sensitive to reported earnings,'' said
Jeffrey Gathers, a Towers Perrin consultant.
   Under the new rule, companies have the option of reporting their
entire financial obligation to future retirees on the annual
financial statement, or to amortize, or spread out, that expected
obligation over the next 20 years, said Richard J. Poccia, a
partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the leading U.S. accounting
firms.
   ``It's hard to say which way companies will go,'' he said.
``Some companies could have the view it's worth getting behind
them.''

   Oil prices shot up late Tuesday as some traders
made last-minute purchases of crude to cover their losses from
erroneous speculation that peace prospects in the Persian Gulf
would send prices down.
   ``You play the game, you get hurt sometimes,'' said Brendan
Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``People looking for
a down move didn't get it.''
   Light sweet crude oil showed little change most of the day on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Near the end of trading, as the
contract for crude delivery in January was about to expire, oil
jumped up sharply, hitting $1.75 per barrel higher at the close.
   Crude settled at $27.86 per barrel, up 81 cents, for January
delivery.
   The expiration of the next-month contract forced late buying by
traders who had gone short, or agreed to sell oil on the theory
that prices would drop. They got trapped into a round of
``short-covering'' as crude hovered at a higher level than they had
hoped, analysts said.
   Before the late surge, oil prices had been fairly dormant as
persistant war fears were not strong enough to lift the market out
of some early holiday doldrums.
   The possibility that a peaceful resolution could end the Middle
East crisis was keeping a damper on the generally bullish mood
fueled by the continual failure of the United States and Iraq to
set up meetings for discussing the turmoil.
   ``The market seems to kind of be stuck on the one hand by the
perception that maybe war is more likely, but the fear is that if
there is an eleventh-hour diplomatic solution, it would send it
down,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric
Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   Natural gas prices, which have taken a heavy hit lately amid
warmish fall weather, tumbled another 12.9 cents, settling at
$2.046 per 1,000 cubic feet on January delivery contracts, which
also expired Tuesday.
   In October, natural gas for January delivery had traded as high
as $2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet, but the weather has stripped away
almost a third of that futures price by the time the industry was
getting set to arrange deliveries of natural gas for January over
the next week or so.
   ``Prices are declining in the cash market because of the very
warm weather we've had so far,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior
oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Futures prices for refined petroleum products showed little
change Tuesday.
   Home heating oil for January delivery was up .94 cent at 75.67
per gallon. Unleaded gasoline for January delivery was up .39 cent
at 66.72 per gallon.
   Unlike crude oil and natural gas, their contracts for January
delivery will be traded until later this month.
   After the oil market was closed, the American Petroleum
Institute reported the nation's crude supply had risen last week,
as had gasoline stocks, although the home heating oil supply was
down a bit.
   The crude oil stockpile was at 341.5 million barrels, up from
332.1 million barrels a week earlier but down from 347.8 million
barrels a year earlier, API said in its weekly survey.
   The gasoline stockpile was at 224.6 million barrels, up from
221.7 million barrels a week earlier and down from 226.5 million
barrels a year earlier.
   The supply of distillates, which include home heating oil, were
at 132.6 million barrels, down from 133.4 million barrels a week
earlier but up from 116.2 million barrels a year earlier.

   Stock price were whipped into a late rally
Tuesday by a surprise announcement that the Federal Reserve will
cut a key lending rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 33.41 points to
close at 2,626.73 after languishing for most of the session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
969 up, 577 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.46 million
shares, up from 118.56 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 214.56 million shares.
   Stock and bond prices spiked higher in the final hour of trading
following the announcement that the Fed will cut the discount rate
from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, effective Wednesday.
   The move, long sought by economists and politicians to prevent
the economy from stumbling into an unnecessarily deep recession,
marked the first easing of the rate since August 1986. The news
caught the markets by surprise in part because it came while
trading was still under way.
   Some analysts argued, however, that the cut was not important
from a technical standpoint since it merely brings the discount
rate into alignment with other interest rates that already have
been reduced.
   But all agreed the Fed's action was critical from a
psychological perspective. ``It sends a message to the markets and
to consumers - a very loud and strong message - that the Fed is
aware the economy is slowing and is doing something about it,''
said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   ``Therefore, it might be one of the many pieces that helps
stabilize consumer confidence, which has been rapidly
deteriorating,'' he added.
   The rate cut helped draw buyers, jolting the market higher. But
analysts were divided over how long the cut might influence
trading.
   Gene Jay Seagle, a vice president at Gruntal Financial Inc.,
likened the Fed action to lighting a fuse and allowing funds to
flow into equities. He said it could put the Dow average on track
to challenge the 2,700 level.
   But on the economic front, Michael Metz, a vice president at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., countered that ``this does not signal the end of
the recession by any means. ... We're going to have to slug through
some very difficult quarters in '91.''
   Economists generally agree that it usually takes between six and
nine months for a change in monetary policy to filter through and
have an impact on the economy.
   The Fed announcement followed a Labor Department report showing
a moderate 0.3 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index in
November. Traders felt the report, which indicated inflation is
restrained, gave the Fed room to ease rates.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Citicorp rose } to 14&lsqb;,
with more than 3.46 million shares changing hands. The nation's
largest banking company announced it was lowering its dividend,
taking a $300 millio charge to cover the cost of 8,000 job cuts.
   Manufacturers Hanover, which said it was not cutting its
dividend, jumped 1~ to 20~. Elsewhere, AT&amp;T advanced } to 31&rsqb;;
Philip Morris rose ~ to 51|; American Express was up { at 21};
General Motors rose 1\ to 35&lsqb;, and General Electric jumped 1{ to
56~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $31.97 billion, or 1.05
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.97 to 180.19.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index was up 4.10 to 386.06, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 4.03 at 330.05.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
advanced 4.45 to 370.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 305.03, up 1.04.

<HEAD>OJ Futures Surge But Florida Freeze is Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices soared in panicked buying Tuesday on
the New York Cotton Exchange as forecasts for a frosty Christmas
weekend in much of the country tripped memories of last year's
disastrous Florida freeze.
   But analysts and meteorologists said fears of a similar killing
frost in the next week were unfounded because freezing temperatures
from the cold wave are unlikely to reach Florida and the orange
harvest is running far ahead of last year's.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures rallied strongly;
precious metals rose; grains and soybeans retreated; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices settled 4.9
cents to 5.75 cents higher with the contract for delivery in
January up 5.75 cents at $1.0975 a pound, a four-week high.
   Orange juice futures have climbed by nearly 10 cents, or about
10 pecent, since dropping below $1 a pound on Dec. 10 for the first
time in more than four years.
   The market generally has been falling since mid-October, when
the Agriculture Department projected a Florida orange harvest of
165 million 90-pound boxes, a 45 percent increase over a year ago.
The forecast was unchanged in last week's USDA crop report.
   Orange juice prices spiked above $2 a pound last January after a
Christmas Eve freeze ruined an estimated 30 percent of the Flrida
orange crop.
   A Florida freeze looks unlikely for this weekend, although much
of the central and western United States is in for bitter cold,
said Peter R. Leavitt, executive director of Weather Services Corp.
in Bedford, Mass.
   ``We're not expecting this to be a threat to Florida, at least
over the next five days,'' he said. ``On the contrary, temperatures
over the next few days in Florida will be well above normal.''
   Judith Ganes, orange juice analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
said the rally began when traders holding obligations to sell
orange juice began buying offsetting contracts to even up their
positions ahead of the four-day holiday weekend.
   She said that buying prompted rumors of a Florida freeze threat,
``and then you saw people starting to panic. It was a snowball
effect.''
   But Ganes said that even if a freeze similar to last year's did
occur, the damage would be much less because the crop now is
concentrated farther south than a year ago and at least 25 percent
of it already has been picked compared with 8 percent at the same
time last year.
   Oil prices shot up late in the session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as some traders made last-minute purchases of
crude to cover their losses from erroneous speculation that peace
prospects in the Persian Gulf would send prices down.
   ``People looking for a down move didn't get it,'' said Brendan
Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 40 cents to 81 cents higher with
January at $27.86 a barrel; heating oil was .94 cent to 1.4 cents
higher with January at 75.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.39 cent to 1.13 cents higher with January at 66.72 cents a pound;
natural gas was 0.5 cent to 12.9 cents lower with January at $2.046
per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Gold futures fell slightly and silver edged higher in dull
trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold ended 40 cents to $1 lower with December at $376.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.4 cent higher with December at
$3.96 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly on the Chicago
Board of Trade as traders awaited confirmation of rumored sales of
U.S. corn and soybean meal to the Soviet Union.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department said private
exporters sold 266,500 metric tons of corn to the Soviets.
   Wheat futures finished 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with December at
$2.51} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with December at
$2.25 a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 4 cents lower with December
at $1.06{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 4{ cents lower with
March at $5.83\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were little changed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Pork futures fell.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower with December at
80.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with January at 89.22 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent
to 1 cent lower with December at 50.40 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .85 cent lower with February at 62.22
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls as Fed Cuts Discount Rate; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell moderately against most foreign
currencies Tuesday in a flurry of trading prompted by a
long-awaited move from the Federal Reserve Board to lower its key
bank lending rate.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   However, traders said the dollar's decline was cushioned by the
continued potential for a war in the Persian Gulf to disrupt
foreign economies heavily dependent on imported oil.
   ``In a normal market (the drop) would be a lot bigger,'' said
Walter Simon, vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co.
   The central bank's lowering of the discount rate from 7 percent
to 6.5 percent, effective Wednesday, had been expected for some
time. But traders took it as a further indication of the slumping
U.S. economy, which generally erodes the dollar's value against
foreign currencies.
   ``Action was taken against the background of weakness in the
economy, constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary
aggregates,'' the Fed said, in announcing its first discount rate
reduction since August 1986. A decrease in the Fed's discount rate
often signals that other short-term loans such as adjustable-rate
mortgages and car loans also will become less expensive.
   ``This is displaying to the market the lack of confidence in the
economy the Fed has,'' said Simon.
   Traders said the dollar displayed its greatest weakness against
the German mark amid a trend of rising interest rates in that
country.
   They speculated that some European economies may move this week
to firm up their interest rates to stabilize their currencies
against the German mark. This could further weaken the dollar.
   ``The market's response has been stronger buying marks instead
of selling dollars,'' said Chris Mendell, a vice president at
Security Pacific National Bank.
   The dollar closed at 1.4780 German marks in New York, down from
late Monday's 1.4870. In Europe, the late dollar rate was 1.4840
German marks, down from 1.4867 late Monday.
   The dollar decline on the Fed's move came after an earlier
weakening on the worst U.S. monthly trade deficit numbers in almost
three years. The government reported that the trade deficit climbed
to $11.61 billion in October, the biggest imbalance since February
1988.
   It cost $1.9305 in New York to buy one British pound, unchanged
from late Monday. In London, sterling rose to $1.9350 from $1.9290
late Monday.
   The dollar weakened in New York to a closing 132.72 Japanese
yen, down from 133.10 late Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.07
yen to a closing 133.03 yen, and later in London, it was quoted at
a higher rate of 13.25 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
prices, included: 1.2667 Swiss francs, down from 1.2745; 5.0375
French francs, down from 5.0620; 1,118.00 Italian lire, down from
1,122.75; and 1.1554 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1579.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.4840 German marks, down from 1.4867; 1.2695 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2747; 5.0550 French francs, down from 5.0578;
1.6735 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6760; 1,121.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,122.75; and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1572.
   Gold fell slightly in New York, down $1 a troy ounce to $376.50
on the Commodity Exchange. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a
bid of $375.75 a troy ounce, down 75 cents from late Monday.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $377.50 a troy
ounce, up from $377.00 bid late Monday. In Zurich, the metal rose
to a closing bid of $377.20 from $377.00 bid late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 37 cents to close at a bid
$377.31.
   Silver rose in New York to $3.96 a troy ounce, up 4 cents from
late Monday. In London, the precious metal fell to a late bid price
of $3.77 a troy ounce from $3.96 bid late Monday.

   Upjohn Co. said Tuesday that William U.
Parfet, who rose to executive vice president through the financial
ranks, will become president of the pharmaceutical company on Jan.
1.
   Theodore Cooper, who had served as chairman, president and chief
executive officer since Dec. 31, 1989, will continue as chairman
and chief executive.
   ``This reorganization represents succession planning to prepare
leaders for the future,'' said Cooper, 61.
   Cooper also said he was eliminating the company's current
four-member office of the chairman and expanding it to an 11-member
corporate management office, which he would use to evaluate
succession candidates.
   Cooper, who became chairman in 1987, hasn't announced retirement
plans, company spokesman John P. Lambrechts said.
   Parfet, 44, became an Upjohn executive vice president in 1989,
responsible for its agricultural division, chemical division,
consumer products and finance. As president he will also oversee
worldwide pharmaceutical research and development.
   Upjohn, which had 1989 sales of $2.91 billion, employs about
20,000 people worldwide. It produces human and animal health care
products and agricultural seeds and specialty chemicals.

<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. officials met with Trans World
Airlines Inc. Chairman Carl C. Icahn soon after getting his latest
buyout offer, a Pan Am spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``We have had a meeting with him since then,'' Jeff Kriendler
said. Kriendler declined to provide any details on who attended the
meeting, when or where it had occurred or what, if anything, had
been accomplished.
   Icahn did not immediately return a phone call placed to his
office in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
   Over the weekend, Icahn announced plans to sell all of TWA's
London routes and other assets to healthier rival, American
Airlines, in a package worth $625 million.
   At the same time, Icahn said he had written Pan Am Chairman
Thomas G. Plaskett in a letter dated Sunday in which he offered to
buy Pan Am's 150 million outstanding shares for $1.50 a share in
cash and $1 a share in either preferred stock or notes.
   ``In these extremely complicated and troubled times for the
airline industry, a combination of TWA and Pan Am might offer both
of us the opportunity to compete with the three major U.S.
airlines,'' Icahn wrote, saying the offer was good through Friday.
   Some analysts had viewed a TWA-Pan Am merger as a good move for
each of the struggling airlines, although others doubted it would
ever come off.
   Pan Am has the movie scenes inside the ornate
courthouse in May. He argued that the depiction of rioting black
characters would undermine what little faith blacks have left in
the justice system.
   Wilentz said in an affidavit that he is constitutionally
permitted and even duty-bound to consider whether the content of a
movie scene is ``inappropriate for the judiciary to be associated
with.''
   Essex County Executive Nicholas Amato sued Wilentz in May,
claiming the chief judge trampled on the First Amendment and
deprived the county of a $250,000 donation from Warner Bros.
   Politan ruled in the county's favor, but did not grant the
$250,000 monetary award the county sought.
   ``By acting to further his concern for the welfare of the black
community, (Wilentz) egregiously trammelled a fundamental bulwark
against the spread of governmental despotism,'' Politan wrote.
   Wilentz had offered to let the company film if they would change
a scene, but producer Fred Caruso declined.
   The film, based on Tom Wolfe's novel, looks at New York's legal
system, illuminating the city's racial and class divisions.
   ``The film is not about, nor is it designed to document rioting
blacks any more so than it is designed to malign drunken English
reporters or greedy philandering white men,'' Politan wrote.

<HEAD>Retailers Report $86.7 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federated and Allied department stores,
which have been operating under bankruptcy court protection for
nearly a year, said Tuesday they lost $86.7 million in the three
months ending Nov. 3.
   The companies called the figure a sign of improved performance
in the face of a weakening economy and lower-than-expected sales.
They lost $92.5 million in the same period last year before they
sought refuge from creditors.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. said total sales for
Bloomingdale's, Lazarus and its three other store chains fell 6.2
percent to $1.1 billion for the quarter. Allied Stores Corp. said
sales for its four store chains fell 2.8 percent to $624 million.
   For the nine months ending Nov. 3, Federated and Allied said
they lost $312.6 million, a lower figure than the $330.1 million
they lost in the year-earlier period.
   Federated said sales fell 5.3 percent to $3.1 billion for the
first nine months of the year. Allied, whose chains include The Bon
Marche and Jordan Marsh, said sales fell 2.4 percent to $1.7
billion.
   Federated and Allied sought protection from creditors Jan. 15
because of inability to service $7.7 billion in debts accrued when
they were taken over by the Campeau Corp. of Canada in the 1980s.
   A bankruptcy court has given them until February to file a
reorganization plan. After that time, creditors may propose their
own plans.
   Individually, Federated lost $57.8 million during the quarter,
14 percent above the $50.7 million it lost in the same period last
year. Allied lost $28.9 million, 30 percent below its $41.8 million
third-quarter loss last year.
   ``The consumer has not demonstrated a great deal of faith in the
nation's near-term economic future, and there is little indication
that this will change significantly in the closing weeks of the
year,'' Federated and Allied chairman and chief executive officer
Allen Questrom said.
   ``Still, we expect our earnings from operations will be
consistent with our plans for the season.''

<HEAD>Fed Steps Up Recession Fight with Discount Rate Cut</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new 7th-8th grafs: ``The Fed,'' analyst comment. Also
moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve cut a key lending rate by
one-half percentage point on Tuesday, sending its strongest signal
to date that it intends to battle the growing weakness in the
American economy with easier credit.
   The Fed announced that it was lowering its discount rate, the
interest it charges to make loans to banks, from 7 percent to 6.5
percent.
   It was the first reduction in this interest rate in more than
four years. Analysts predicted the cut would prompt a reduction in
a variety of business and consumer loan rates, including banks'
benchmark prime lendingrate.
   The announcement came hours after the release of two government
reports showing that consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in
November and that America's trade deficit soared in October to
$11.6 billion, its highest level in 2{ years.
   Analysts said the good news on inflation gave the Fed room to
lower interest rates while the trade report showed the urgent need
to do so by raising the possibility that the new recession could be
more severe than previously expected.
   The Fed took the unusual step of announcing its action 30
minutes before New York financial markets closed. The move prompted
an immediate rally on Wall Street with the Dow Jones industrial
average rising 33.41 points to 2,626.73.
   Many analysts interpreted the Fed's timing as an effort to
impress upon investors how committed the central bank is to
bolstering the economy.
   ``This aggressive and decisive easing move by the Federal
Reserve is an attempt to stop a run-away downturn and to set the
stage for recovery,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co., an investment advisory firm. ``The fact that the Fed
acted before the close (of the markets) was a clear signal ... that
the Fed is not going to stand by and let the economy dive into a
severe downturn.''
   For the last two months, the Fed had been making more modest
moves at easing credit conditions by engineering reductions in the
federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other, from 8
percent to the current 7.25 percent.
   A reduction in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the
Fed can send of its intention to fight economic weakness with lower
interest rates.
   The Bush administration, concerned by the signs of widespread
economic weakness, had been pushing for some time for a more
assertive credit-easing campaign on the part of the Fed.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
hailed the Fed decision as welcome news.
   ``It should be helpful in promoting growth in the economy in the
months ahead,'' Fitzwater said. ``This move appears justified by
the budget agreement and the general slowdown.''
   Until Tuesday the Fed had resisted administration entreaties for
an aggressive easing out of fear that financial markets would be
panicked into believing the central bank was abandoning its fight
to restrain inflation at a time when the Persian Gulf crisis had
sent energy prices soaring.
   However, economists said that the December report on consumer
prices, which showed them rising at a moderate annual rate of 3.7
percent, had given the central bank confidence that the initial oil
shock following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait was beginning to
abate.
   In addition, the steep widening of the trade deficit raised
concerns that the already bleak prospects for the economy in the
fourth quarter would be even worse by removing one of the few
remaining sources of strength.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said the Fed was
pursuing the right course.
   ``It needs to be worrying about the economy going down more than
it needs to be worrying about inflation,'' he said.
   The Fed's decision to lower the discount rate was the result of
a 6-0 vote by the Fed's board of governors. The vote came at the
end of a closed-door strategy session of the central bank's top
policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of
members of the board and presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks.
   In advance of Tuesday's meeting, many analysts had predicted
that the Fed would ease rates further, although few had been
expecting a cut in the discount rate this soon.
   Many thought the central bank would wait until January to see
whether a shooting war broke out in the Middle East, an event with
the potential of greatly increasing inflationary pressures by
pushing oil prices higher.
   In a statement, the central bank said it had taken the action
``against the background of weakness in the economy, constraints on
credit and slow growth'' of the nation's money supply.
   It was the first change in the discount rate since the central
bank raised it from 6.5 percent on Feb. 24, 1989, and the first
reduction since August 1986 when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker was fighting widespread economic weakness with lower rates.
   Economists said they had no doubt that the Fed policymakers are
convinced the country has entered its first recession since the
1981-82 downturn although Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
has stopped short of using that term, instead calling the current
weakness ``a meaningful downturn.''
   The discount rate cut comes after a string of economic
indicators pointing to widespread weakness. Industrial output has
fallen for three consecutive months while the nation's unemployment
rate has risen to 5.9 percent, its highest level in three years.
   Adding to the gloom was Tuesday's report on merchandise trade in
October.
   Export growth and a narrowing trade deficit have been two of the
few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster economy. Analysts said
a rising trade deficit means even this source of strength will be
removed in the final three months of the year, the period most
forecasters are pinpointing as the start of the recession.
   ``This is a bad number,'' David Wyss, an economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill, said of the October trade deficit. ``It suggests
that we are not going to get as much help from net exports as we
had hoped and it suggests there is more inventory out there than we
had thought.''
   Wyss said he had subtracted an additional one-half percentage
point from overall economic activity in the fourth quarter based on
October's trade number, putting the decline in the gross national
product according to his forecast at a sharp annual rate of 3.5
percent.
   Much of the deterioration in the trade deficit came from a 17
percent jump in America's October oil bill, which climbed to $7.23
billion, the highest monthly total since April 1981.
   The volume of imports was little changed at 8.03 million barrels
daily, but the average price per barrel shot up $4.73, to $29.04.
   For October, imports rose 12.2 percent to an all-time high of
$46.38 billion, while exports also set a record, rising 8.6 percent
to $34.77 billion.
   The trade gap, the difference between imports and exports, was
at its highest level since a $12.56 billion deficit in February
1988.
   Through the first 10 months of 1990, the trade deficit was
running at an annual rate of $103 billion, putting the country on
track for its seventh consecutive year of deficits above $100
billion.

   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. announced Tuesday it had
completed the sale of $119 million in additional equity to several
of its stockholders and received the proceeds from the transaction.
   Macy has said it planned to use cash from the sale to buy back
some of its bonds. The retailer, which is still paying the bills
from its $3.74 billion 1986 leveraged buyout, has taken steps
including bond buybacks in recent months to reduce its debt load.
   Four Macy shareholders - GE Capital Corp., Loews Corp., Mutual
Series Fund and Taubman Investment Co. - had given the retailer
commitments to buy a minimum of $100 million in Macy stock.
   Some analysts had warned the company could face financial
problems with suppliers early next year if it did not complete the
equity sale.
   On Dec. 7, Macy announced it had lost $56.5 million in its first
quarter, compared to a loss of $33.1 million a year earlier. The
quarter ended Oct. 31.
   Macy has been under sharp scrutiny since it lost $39 million
during its second quarter a year ago. That period included a
disastrous Christmas season.
   The company has not commented on how it is faring this holiday
season.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the retailer also owns the I. Magnin and Bullock's
department store chains in California and the West, and specialty
stores including Charter Club, Fantasies by Morgan Taylor and
Aeropostale.

<HEAD>Signs of the Time: Citicorp To Lay Off 8,000; Fed Stimulates
Economy</HEAD>

   A dramatic restructuring by the nation's largest
bank and the Federal Reserve's first discount-rate cut in more than
four years have underscored the deep troubles afflicting the
banking industry.
   But some analysts predicted Tuesday that further action looms to
nurse ailing banks and the economy as a whole back to health.
   Citicorp said it would lay off 8,000 workers, planned to slash
its annual dividend 78 cents to $1 per share, and set aside $350
million to cover bad commercial loans. The shakeup is estimated to
provide Citicorp $800 million in annual savings.
   The layoffs are planned over the next three years, Citicorp
said.
   Later in the day, the Federal Reserve wielded its most powerful
tool to stimulate economic growth by cutting the discount rate, the
interest it charges to make loans to banks, by { percent to 6{
percent.
   Stocks and bonds rallied on the Fed announcement, with the Dow
Jones industrial average rising 33.41 points to 2,626.73.
Citicorp's stock rose 75 cents a share in heavy trading.
   It was the discount rate's first drop since August 1986 and
appeared to be part of a larger plan by the Fed to loosen credit to
stimulate economic growth.
   ``They are obviously separate reactions to a similar problem,''
said Jim Chessen of the American Bankers Association in Washington.
   Falling real estate values and a widening national recession
have led to problems in the banking industry not seen since the
Great Depression of the 1930s. Many banks have closed, others are
cutting operations and the federal insurance fund protecting
depositor accounts is running out of money.
   Chessen, the ABA's deputy director for policy development, said
the moves are a response to slackening demand for loans and
problems with credit quality in parts of the country, particularly
recession-struck New England and the Southwest.
   The economic downturn has been blamed on the failure of 734
banks nationwide in the last 3{ years, which has drained the
government's deposit insurance fund. On Monday, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman discussed proposals to
revive the fund with $24 billion from a 1 percent assessment on all
bank deposits.
   Wayne Ayers, chief economist for the Bank of Boston, said
Cticorp's restructuring ``is symptomatic of much of the problems
affecting the banking industry.''
   ``Citibank is not alone,'' said Chessen, referring to the
company's banking subsidiary.
   The banking company said the layoffs would lead to a one-time
cost of $300 million, bringing a projected fourth quarter loss to
$300 million to $400 million. It said it was making the
announcement to keep stockholders ``appropriately informed.''
   The announcement on loan loss reserves followed an detailed
examination of its loan portfolio by the U.S. Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. A comptroller spokeswoman said banking
audits are confidential and the results won't be released.
   The company said it would discuss the developments in greater
detail following release of its year-end results in mid-January.
Based in New York, Citicorp is the nation's leading banking company
with assets exceeding $230.6 billion.
   The Fed's cut in the discount rate generally precedes a
reduction in a bank's prime rate, an important rate that is often a
benchmark for a range of other consumer loan rates such as
mortgages. Norwest Bank of Minneapolis, Minn., cut its prime rate \
percent late Tuesday to 9.75 percent.
   Norwest president James R. Campbell said the company is the
first major U.S. bank to lower their rate.
   Norwest Bank is the largest banking affiliate of Norwest
Corporation, a financial services organization with $29.6 billion
in assets. Three small banks cut their prime rates on Dec. 7 after
the Fed dropped to 7\ percent the rate charges for federal funds,
the rate which banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   How quickly other banks follow and cut their prime rates is open
to speculation, analysts said.
   The ABA's Chessen said banks ``will take slow, measured steps in
lowering their prime rate. There's a lot of uncertainty in the
market and they will react cautiously.''

   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company,
announced a drastic reorganization plan that will slash stock
dividends, quadruple projected layoffs to 8,000 and set aside
additional money to cover bad loans, resulting in a fourth-quarter
loss of at least $300 million.
   Tuesday's announcement followed similar steps taken by other
leading U.S. banks that have been hammered by declining real estate
values and a slumping economy.
   It was unclear when the layoffs would take place but the bank
had said previously it intended to lay off 2,000 workers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve cut a key lending rate by
one-half percentage point, sending its strongest signal to date
that it intends to battle the growing weakness in the American
economy with easier credit.
   The Fed announced Tuesday that it was lowering its discount
rate, the interest it charges to make loans to banks, from 7
percent to 6.5 percent. It was the first reduction in this interest
rate in more than four years.
   Analysts predicted the cut would prompt a reduction in a variety
of business and consumer loan rates.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States suffered the worst monthly
trade deficit in 2{ years in October, an $11.6 billion imbalance
that analysts said would make the early months of the recession
worse than expected.
   However, in a second report Tuesday, the government said
consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in December, reflecting
an easing of inflationary pressures.
   The bad trade news prompted some economists to revise downward
their already bleak forecasts for overall economic performance in
the current October-December quarter.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The board that makes the nation's accounting
rules has approved a far-reaching change in the way businesses
report health-care costs for retired workers, a move spurring
companies to reduce retiree benefits.
   The new rule, which takes effect in 1993, requires companies to
subtract from their annual earnings a portion of the costs of the
benefits they have promised to future retirees.
   Experts say a handful of large companies already have instituted
cutbacks in retiree health benefits to reduce the rule change's
financial impact on their earnings statements.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board approved the change
Dec. 7.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Attorneys general from 23 states accused a
pharmaceutical company of price fixing and other trade violations
in marketing a new drug for schizophrenics.
   In lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on
Tuesday, the states claim the drug, Clozaril, is available only if
a patient also buys an expensive blood-monitoring package.
   The attorneys general sued Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East
Hanover, N.J., and Caremark Inc., of Lincolnshire, Ill., which has
an exclusive contract with Sandoz to provide the blood-monitoring
package.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Intel Corp. has developed a speedier
version of its flagship microprocessor chip to challenge technology
that could jeopardize Intel's market share, according to an Intel
research paper.
   The new chip is about half the size of Intel's top-end 80486
chip, which is used in powerful personal computers and mid-range
machines, but it is up to three times faster, the San Francisco
Chronicle reported Tuesday.
   But the chip may operate too quickly for the way most computers
are currently designed, analysts and competitors say. They add that
Intel's factories may not be able to produce the chip in volume for
at least three years.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An administrative law judge has recommended
that President Bush's son Neil be restricted in any future
positions in the banking and savings industries, the Office of
Thrift Supervision announced.
   Neil Bush, who was charged by regulators with conflict of
interest in his role as a director of a failed Colorado savings and
loan, could have drawn a recommendation that he be barred
permanently from the industry.
   Instead, an administrative law judge proposed that Bush be
required to meet certain conditions if he again becomes a director

<HEAD>Asbestos Victims Appeal Judge's Approval of Class</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for asbestos victims asked a federal
appeals court Tuesday to overturn a judge's approval of a class
action in the Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. case.
   The victims, who have sued Eagle-Picher, asked the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to rescind U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein's approval earlier this month of the class action.
   In court papers, attorneys argued Weinstein did not have
authority to approve a mandatory class action for those suing the
company in federal and state courts.
   ``Judge Weinstein's attempt to stay and enjoin litigation
pending in other state and federal courts clearly and dramatically
exceeds his judicial authority,'' the papers said.
   The approval of the class action was seen as an essential step
in settling nearly 70,000 claims against Eagle-Picher.
   Weinstein wants to fashion a nationwide settlement of an
estimated 100,000 cases against dozens of companies whose
asbestos-containing products helped cause cancer and other
respiratory diseases in American workers.
   The battle over Eagle-Picher is important because it could shape
the future of what is by far the biggest product liability problem
ever to confront the U.S. legal system. Cases clog state and
federal courts nationwide and new claims are being filed by the
thousands.
   Asbestos was used widely in insulation, boilers, automobile
brake linings and other products. Illness from inhaling asbestos
fibers often takes decades to appear, and cases have been mounting
since the early 1970s.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. Tuesday announced they are discussing
combining their back-office data processing operations.
   The deal, which stands to cut costs for handling securities
transactions, would allow for other securities firms to join, the
brokerage firms said in statements.
   Computer systems that provide researc information and support
for financial advisers would not be part of the deal.
   Wall Street's back offices clear securities transactions, moving
securities to the account of the purchaser and money to the account
of the seller.
   The talks are aimed at creating a joint venture by combining the
back offices of Prudential-Bache and Shearson Lehman Brothers. The
venture would be structured to allow other firms to participate.
   The talks come as securities firms look for ways to cut costs to
cope with a Wall Street recession.
   Employment industrywide has dived 17 percent to 216,000 at the
end of June from 262,000 in October 1987, according to the
Securities Industry Association. The reductions place the industry
at 1985 levels, still about 55 percent above total employment in
1980.

<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday sought a civil contempt
order against former CenTrust Chairman David Paul for not posting a
$30.8 million bond.
   Paul was ordered to post the bond to prevent him from
squandering money from the failed thrift. He has challengd the
administrative order, but a judge rejected his arguments and Paul's
attorneys said they would appeal.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision alleged Tuesday that Paul has
made no effort to provide any portion of the security required by
the agency's temporary cease and desist order.
   Paul's Miami attorney, Sandy Bohrer, did not immediately return
a telephone call seeking comment.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis earlier this month rejected
arguments by Paul's attorneys that OTS was improperly pursuing
enforcement actions without benefit of due process or trial, and
cited an ``important governmental interest'' in protecting
depositors' interests.
   Federal regulators took over CenTrust, once Florida's largest
thrift, in February at an estimated loss of $1.8 billion.
   Spending that has been questioned by regulators includes
purchases of Old Masters paintings, a $15 million legal defense
fund for thrift officers and directors, and a private dinner at
Paul's home, cooked by European chefs flown in for the occasion.
