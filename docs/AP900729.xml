   A man who screamed threats over a telephone
emergency line apparently shot his wife and two young sons to death
as she tried to flee with them, then killed himself, police said.
   A 7-year-old family member ran from the house, but was not
injured, said police Sgt. Catherine Crews.
   The man and woman were dead at their home in east Tacoma, and
the two boys were taken to Mary Bridge Hospital, where they were
declared dead. The victims' identities were not immediately
available.
   The bodies of the woman and the children were found the back
yard, and the man's body was found in the house, Crews said. ``The
logical assumption is that she tried to get out of the house with
the children,'' she said.
   The children were six months and three years old, Crews said.
   She said the emergency call was made by the woman, who said her
husband was pointing a gun at the younger boy.
   ``There was a lot of screaming, and she threw the phone down. He
was threatening to kill the child,'' Crews said.
   Officers responded to the call, but in the meantime a neighbor
called to report three gunshots. Police found the bodies, Crews
said.
   There was no immediate indication of what provoked the man or
what led up to the shootings, the sergeant said.

   A 50,000-gallon oil slick from two
collision-ruptured barges in Galveston Bay moved away from shore
Sunday as cleanup crews tried to deflect the 5-mile-long patch from
sensitive marshlands, the Coast Guard said.
   Both barges were damaged Saturday in a collision with the
Liberian oil tanker Shinoussa in the Houston Ship Channel. One
barge nearly sank, and the other was listing.
   The barges were among three being towed by the tugboat Chandy N.
The tug was undamaged, and no injuries were reported.
   Crews worked Sunday to contain the spilling oil as the ship
channel remained closed, backing up several vessels for the second
time in a week.
   Oil leaking from the nearly sunken barge bubbled to the water's
surface, while oil spilling from the other vessel was mostly
trapped by absorbent pads.
   In addition to the main slick, a smaller patch developed near
the accident site, said Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene.
   ``It's nothing significant compared to the patch in the north,''
Greene said. However, the new patch was about a mile from a beach
south of the accident site.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Frank Whipple said officials flew over the
slick Sunday afternoon. ``It's in the same general area where it
was this morning, and that's good news,'' Whipple said.
   ``Our concern right now is mainly the oil in the water and
keeping it out of the sensitive areas, and the barge that's leaking
_ securing it so that it stops leaking oil,'' he added.
   The patchy slick drifted north-northeast earlier Sunday, further
into the larger part of the bay but also on a possible path towards
Trinity Bay, which has several sensitive estuaries, Coast Guard
Petty Officer Larry Meredith said.
   The slick, which starts about two miles from the accident site,
changed to a southerly course as currents changed Sunday afternoon,
Greene said.
   ``The slick is going to keep oscillating, back and forth, each
time farther and farther north and south with the tides,'' Greene
said.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Schaefer said salvage crews
were working to right the nearly sunken barge while tugboats
surrounded the second barge to keep it afloat.
   Booms were placed around both barges to contain spilling oil.
Together, the two were carrying about 700,000 gallons of ``catfeed
oil,'' similar to a No. 5 heavy crude used in refining, Greene said.
   He said crews also placed about 2,500 feet of boom at the
slick's leading edge.
   ``We hope to encircle the patch and hold it there, so they can
get skimmers out there to suck it'' before it hits land, Greene
said.
   Apex RE&amp;T Inc., a St. Louis-based towing firm, owns the tug and
barges, and was working with salvage contractor T&amp;T Marine of
Galveston on the cleanup, Schaefer said.
   Salvage crews had planned to transfer the fuel from the barges
to other vessels Sunday evening, but Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene
Maestas said the transfer process would not begin before Monday.
   Divers were expected to examine the almost sunken barge Monday
to determine the best way to transfer the oil, Maestas said.
   The third barge, carrying 20,000 barrels of fuel, was moved up
the ship channel, Schaefer said.
   The 601-foot tanker, carrying 29,400 metric tons of jet fuel,
remained anchored, Schaefer said. Although the collision left a
gash in its hull, the vessel didn't leak because of its double
hull. The 27,793-ton Shinoussa was built this year, he said.
   Texas Water Commission Chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne III said
there was some difficulty getting booms in place in the bay because
of the shallows surrounding the channel.
   ``It's in the open bay and we're quite concerned about that,
although this is not a relatively big spill,'' Wynne said. ``There
are some very sensitive estuary areas in Galveston Bay and they
could be threatened.''
   Although more oil was spilled from the Norwegian supertanker
Mega Borg last month, the latest accident could be more serious
because of the heavier oil and the proximity to marshlands, Wynne
said.
   ``Our sensitive areas are behind the barrier islands, where this
spill is,'' Wynne said.
   Some thought has been given to employing oil-eating bacteria,
which were used experimentally to clean up the Mega Borg spill oil
and were found to have done so without hurting the environment,
Wynne said.
   But the results of that bioremediation experiment haven't been
fully analyzed, so it might not be prudent to use the microbes to
clean the Galveston Bay spill, he said.
   Houston Audubon Society President Gary Clark said 75 to 100
species of Texas birds, including egrets, herons and terns nest
around the bay. He said the worst scenarios would be for oil to
pollute Armand Bayou, which he called ``the only pristine tributary
left in Texas.''
   ``We're going to have to do a lot of hoping,'' Clark said.
   The Mega Borg, which was transferring oil to a smaller vessel
about 57 miles off Galveston, was rocked by a series of explosions
June 8 and spilled 3.9 million gallons of light Angolan crude into
the Gulf of Mexico. Four crewmen were killed in the blast and 17
were injured. Cleanup crews worked in the area for more than two
weeks to contain the spill.

<HEAD>Tourists Avoiding Pisa; No Work Yet on Leaning Tower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after the Leaning Tower was closed
to the public, work to keep it from toppling has yet to begin and
the mayor of the tourist-abandoned city is appealing to Rome for
help.
   The tower's 293 steps to the top were last climbed on Jan. 7,
when the mayor reluctantly locked the wooden doors to the 180-foot
tower with a steel key and expressed hope work would begun soon so
the monument can reopen.
   Since then, the mayor's office has a new occupant and the city
has been losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in entrance fees _
the monument attracts some 800,000 tourists a year who pay $3.35
apiece to climb the spiral staircase for a disorientating view of
the Tuscan city.
   Some tourists, of course, still pass through Pisa, but with the
tower closed, the city is less appealing.
   Newly elected Mayor Sergio Cortopassi said he's appealing to
Premier Giulio Andreotti in hopes of spurring a quick start to
work, Italian newspapers reported Sunday.
   The reports said Cortopassi wants the government to convene a
meeting on the situation in the next two weeks.
   Cortopassi's predecessor signed a order in December authorizing
closure, but experts have yet to get moving on a plan to stop the
tower from leaning further. Parliament hasn't yet appropriated the
$400 million experts estimate the work will cost.
   The tower began to lean almost immediately after Bonnano Pisano
began work on it in 1173; the ground beneath it shifted. It now
leans some 13 feet off perpendicular.
   At least once a year, Italian experts announce new findings that
the tower has leaned some more, usually a couple a millimeters. At
this rate, the tower will eventually topple, experts say, but even
without intervention, it should stand at least 100 years.
   One plan under consideration calls for a wheel-shaped support to
be planted around the base of the tower and connected by spokes to
the marble foundation. Although experts disagree on which is the
best strategy, all say the tower must keep its famous lean.

   Bertha, the first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic
season, was downgraded to a tropical storm Sunday evening as it
headed toward open ocean. Forecasters said the storm could kick up
hgh surf along the Southeast coast.
   Born as a tropical depression off northeast Florida, Bertha grew
quickly Saturday into a swirling storm with winds of 75 mph, just
above the 74 mph needed for hurricane status.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, Bertha's maximum sustained winds were
near 70 mph and centered near 32.9 degrees north latitude and 69.5
degrees west longitude, about 390 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras,
N.C., said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center near Miami.
   The storm was moving northeast at near 14 mph, and was expected
to stay on that course and speed through early Monday while losing
some strength, said forecaster Bob Case.
   Tropical storm force winds of between 39 mph and 73 mph extended
outward up to 288 miles.
   ``Due to the large size of the storm, rough surf conditions will
occur along portions of the southeast U.S. coast from North
Carolina southward,'' Case said earlier Sunday.
   Forecasters said that because it was already edging
northeastward toward the open Atlantic when it was born, Bertha was
never much of a threat.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Arthur, which peaked with 70 mph winds
Thursday but quickly lost strength over the central Caribbean, had
completely dissipated by late Saturday.

   An Army helicopter crashed into a
hillside on a night flight in the early stages of a war game,
killing five soldiers and injuring eight others, authorities said.
   Rescuers had to walk more than a mile to find the UH-60
Blackhawk helicopter about five miles south of Charleston, and used
other helicopters to take the injured to St. Edward Mercy Medical
Center at Fort Smith, said Fort Chaffee spokesman Cecil Green.
   It was one of two fatal military helicopter crashes Friday
night. The second, in the Southern California desert, killed two
Marines and injured three others.
   On Tuesday, an Army helicopter crashed during a night exercise
at Fort Campbell, Ky., killing three soldiers.
   Green said he did not know if there was any indication that the
helicopter at Fort Chaffee had problems before it crashed in a
hilly region north of the Ouachita Mountains. He said weather was
not a factor.
   ``The only thing we know is that the helicopter was in radio
contact with one of the team members on the ground,'' he said. The
ground unit notified headquarters of the crash, he added.
   Reporters were not allowed at the crash site.
   The Army identified the dead as Capt. Gregory W. Sandborn, 1st
Special Forces, of Fort Lewis, Wash.; Master Sgt. Mark R.
Larochelle of the Joint Readiness Training Center, Little Rock,
Ark.; and Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Gradiewicz, Sgt. 1st Class John R.
Duryea and Staff Sgt. Christopher Cummings of 10th Special Forces,
Fort Devens, Mass.
   One of the injured was in critical condition with a head injury
Saturday night, five were in stable condition, one was treated and
released and the condition of another was not available, officials
said.
   The men aboard the $4.6 million helicopter were participating in
an early stage of an exercise slated to begin in earnest this week.
About 300 soldiers were participating in the early stages and when
the exercise is at its peak about 3,000 soldiers will be involved,
Green said.
   ``Realism is the key, and it's played out basically in the field
for about a 10-day war when it starts,'' he said.
   A team of investigators from the Army Safety Center at Fort
Rucker, Ala., arrived at Fort Chaffee around noon, Green said.
   He would not say where the helicopter normally was based. The
Blackhawk has a speed of 145 knots and can carry a payload of 2,640
pounds, according to the Army publication ``U.S. Army Weapons
Systems.''
   It wasn't known if night-vision goggles were being worn during
the exercise, said Col. Myrt Webb, Jr., base commander.
   Night-vision goggles, which amplify available light, came into
controversy in 1988 after 17 soldiers were killed at Fort Campbell,
Ky., when two helicopters collided during a night flight in which
the pilots were using the goggles. The goggles have since been
updated.
   In Southern California, a UH-1N Huey helicopter crashed in the
Chocolate Mountain Bombing Range, about 55 miles northwest of the
Marine Corps Air Station at Yuma, Ariz., said Capt. Mary Baldwin, a
Camp Pendleton spokeswoman.
   The helicopter's pilot, Maj. Bob Maguire, and co-pilot, Lt. Tony
Stancil, were killed in the crash, Baldwin said.
   The Huey was carrying practice rockets and small-caliber
ammunition, Rodriguez said. The pilots were not wearing
night-vision goggles.
   The chopper was assigned to the Medium Light Attack Helicopter
Squadron 367, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, at Camp Pendleton,
Rodriguez said. The squadron has been at Yuma since July 20 for two
weeks of exercises.
   The two helicopter crashes Friday followed another fatal
helicopter crash late Tuesday when an Army helicopter crashed at
Fort Campbell, Ky.
   The pilot, Dale Tate, 45, who suffered head injuries, died
Saturday morning at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn., the hospital said. Two other soldiers were killed
and two were injured, officials said.
   The CH-47D Chinook medium-lift helicopter was on a training
mission when it went down, officials said.

   Former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky,
Austria's most popular postwar political leader and an architect of
its policy of neutrality, died Sunday. He was 79.
   Kreisky was being treated at Lainz hospital for a heart
condition and had been in critical condition, doctors said.
   A Jew, Kreisky was forced to flee Austria from the Nazis but
returned to become its longest-serving chancellor.
   During his tenure as chancellor from 1970 to 1983, he took
advantage of Austria's position as a neutral country on the border
between East and West to carve a mediating role that gave his
nation prominence.
   He drew criticism abroad, especially from Israel, for his Middle
East policies and his ties to PLO chief Yasser Arafat, as well as
for receiving Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and freeing Arab
terrorists who staged a 1975 attack on OPEC's Vienna headquarters.
   However, he was also widely respected in Europe as one of the
leading post-war Social Democrats along with West Germany's Willy
Brandt and Sweden's Olof Palme.
   Born on Jan. 22, 1911, the son of a wealthy industrialist,
Kreisksy was forced to leave Vienna in 1938 after the Nazis annexed
Austria to Germany.
   He went to Sweden, where he first met fellow exile Brandt and
married Vera Fuerst.
   Kreisky returned to Vienna in 1949 and entered the government in
1953 as state secretary in the Foreign Ministry. He served as
foreign minister from 1959 to 1966, and became chancellor in 1970.
   It was the Socialists' failure to win a clear majority in 1983
elections that led Kreisky to step down and hand over the party
leadership.
   Foreign policy was Kreisky's passion.
   A longtime champion of East-West detente, he espoused the idea
of a common Europe long before Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
coined his phrase of ``a common European house.''
   ``There will only be a Europe when we accept that Europe is
everywhere, in the West and in the East as well as in the middle,''
he said in 1975.
   Kreisky sought improved relations with Austria's then Communist
neighbors. But he did not shy away from criticizing human rights
violations in the Soviet bloc and helped establish Austria's
liberal policy of granting asylum to tens of thousands of refugees
from Eastern Europe.
   It was Kreisky's pro-Arab stance and friendly policy toward the
Palestine Liberation Organization, however, that drew the most
attention abroad and brought him into bitter conflict with former
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
   Kreisky's embrace with Arafat at the Vienna airport in 1979
stunned many Austrians and drew sharply worded commentaries in
Israel and elsewhere.
   He once said, ``I am a friend of the Arabs, not with motives
like Laurence of Arabia. As a Socialist, I am a friend of every
people, also those in the Middle East, whether Arabs, Israelis or
Kurds. I am for people carrying out their differences in peace.''
   He also provoked outrage in the West in 1982 when he received
Gadhafi.
   In 1978, Kreisky suffered a strong defeat when Austrians voted
in a national referendum to reject nuclear power.
   In 1986, after indecisive elections forced the Socialists to
form a government with conservative rivals, Kreisky broke with his
party.
   However, he remained a vice president of the Socialist
International. He gave up that post in June 1989 and was elected
honorary president.
   Kreisky is survived by his son, Peter, and his daughter, Susanne.

   An oil tanker collided with two barges
in the Houston Ship Channel on Saturday, sinking one of the barges,
holing another and causing an oil spill of up to 50,000 gallons,
Coast Guard officials said.
   The Liberian-registered tanker Shinoussa was headed into
Galveston Bay when it collided with the barges being moved into the
channel by the tugboat Chandy N near Redfish Island just before 3
p.m., said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kevin Johnson.
   No injuries were reported.
   Both barges suffered damage and were leaking fuel, Johnson said.
One of the barges, loaded with 18,000 barrels of No. 5 heavy fuel
oil, sank at its stern on the channel's east side.
   The second barge, which contained 24,000 barrels of No. 5 fuel,
``is damaged and it's leaking oil,'' Johnson said. ``But it's still
attached to the tug.''
   A mile-long slick of black oil spread along the heavily polluted
channel, about 2 miles offshore and just south of the Galveston
suburb of Kemah, said Coast Guard Commander Frank Whipple.
   The two barges together were carrying 1.76 million gallons of
oil, and up to 50,000 gallons had leaked from them some seven hours
after the collision, Whipple said.
   Booms were deployed Saturday night to contain the spill and the
cleanup was under way, Johnson said.
   A third barge attached to the tugboat and carrying 20,000
barrels of fuel was not damaged, nor was the tug, Johnson said.
   The tanker was damaged and taking on water, but none of its
230,000-barrel cargo of jet fuel leaked, Johnson said. The ship was
moved back up the channel and anchored late Saturday.
   The tug and barges are owned by Apex RE&amp;T Inc., a St.
Louis-based towing firm, Johnson said.
   The damaged barge that did not sink was out of danger, said Tom
Kniestedt of Apex.
   The Houston Ship Channel was closed immediately after the
accident and remained closed at dusk.
   The cause of the collision was being investigated, Johnson said.

   An explosion and fire demolished a block of
buildings in Monroe on Saturday night, injuring at least two
passers-by and shattering storefront windows along Main Street.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but fire
officials said they suspected a gas leak was to blame.
   The explosion at around 10:30 p.m. leveled a building that
housed a bicycle shop and a clothing store and set fire to about
seven adjoining buildings along Main Street, authorities said. It
was followed by a series of smaller blasts.
   ``We have a whole block that's gone,'' said Kathy Phifer, an
emergency dispatcher for the town, which is situated about 25 miles
southeast of Charlotte.
   A Charlotte television station, WSOC-TV, reported that the blast
was heard several miles away.
   About 100 firefighters from across Union County fought the
fires, which were contained within 2{ hours, Ms. Phifer said.
   Two people who were walking nearby suffered minor cuts and were
listed in satisfactory condition at Union Memorial Hospital, said
nursing supervisor Nancy Sarno. Several other people at the scene
were administered first aid for minor injuries, she said.
   Shop owners rushed downtown when they heard of the explosion.
   ``I don't think there's a window left in town on Main Street,''
said Butch Tucker, who owns a jewelry shop across from where the
explosion occurred.

   A siege at a central London nightclub ended
peacefully Sunday when police arrested a gunman holding hostages
and reportedly demanding an aircraft to take him to Beirut,
Scotland Yard said.
   The gunman, wrapped in a red blanket which covered his head,
emerged first from Tokyo Joe's, a popular Middle East haunt in
Clarges Street off Piccadilly, and was bundled into a police
vehicle. Four or five men in suits and casual clothes were then
escorted from the building by police.
   ``Everybody is out and nobody has been hurt,'' said David Dowell
of Scotland Yard. ``A man has been taken away for questioning.''
   The four or five male hostages in the club when the siege ended
appeared tired and dazed but otherwise unhurt, Scotland Yard said.
   Police had no immediate details on how the siege ended.
   The gunman had demanded a bus and plane to take him to Beirut
with 60 Arab hostages, according to a hostage who escaped.
   The Arab hostages included members of the Kuwaiti royal family,
according to another eyewitness, Yacoub Ibrahim, who got out of the
club earlier.
   Scotland said a number of Arab VIPs had been in the club but
gave no names.
   Police carried out lengthy negotiations with the man, reported
to be armed with a shotgun, a pistol, a sword-like knife and a
bomb-like device strapped around his waist.
   When the man burst into the club brandishing guns at about 2
a.m., there were between 100 and 200 patrons inside. Some managed
to escape, and Scotland Yard said a number were released after two
smoked salmon sandwiches were sent in to the gunman this morning.
   Police said some of the escapees needed medical attention and
one was taken out on a stretcher. Shortly before the siege ended at
12:15 p.m., Scotland Yard said 95 people had left the club.
   The siege ended after police negotiated ``face to face but at a
distance'' with the man, who had been drinking heavily, witnesses
said.
   Scotland Yard would not discuss the gunman's demands.
   But Peter Antonello, 53, a barman who escaped from the club
before the siege ended, told reporters the gunman wanted a bus to
take him and 60 Arab hostages he held at one point to the airport
to board a plane for Beirut.
   Antonello said the man had promised police he would not harm 15
European hostages he was also holding.
   ``He just said he was doing it for his wife who had gone to
Beirut with their three children this morning,'' the barman said.
   Police said negotiations were conducted with the aid of an
interpreter, although the man spoke some English.
   Christina Broderick, 20, one of several young British women the
gunman used as a human shield, said she escaped when he fell over
after drinking heavily and snorting cocaine.
   She said the man told police he was Lebanese, with an English
wife and three children, and had indicated that some of his or his
wife's family were being held hostage in Beirut.
   ``The gunman had a button on his belt which was connected to
electrical wiring and what he claimed was TNT,'' she said. ``He
kept calling to the police, saying `Come and check it, it's real.'
   ``But I don't think he has got the guts to use it. He is drunk
and coked to the sky. He was drinking from a bottle of Black Label,
and fell over breaking it and cutting his leg open. It is bleeding
badly.''
   Staff and visitors who were in the street said the police were
called early Sunday after a man with a gun was seen walking through
the packed club toward the basement area about 2 a.m.
   Dennis Tuerena, 38, the doorman, said: ``There were some people
moving at the time and this man just pushed them back and ran in.''
   ``He opened up his waistcoat to show that he had some sort of
device strapped to his front,'' Tuerena said.
   Yacoub Ibrahim, who said he was in London on vacation and had
been inside, told a reporter members of the Kuwaiti royal family
were in the club. Ibrahim said he had not seen them since he
escaped.
   He said the man fired a handgun harmlessly to show it was loaded.

<HEAD>Customs Orders New Procedures for Computer Checks at Borders</HEAD>

   A California real estate agent returning to
the United States was stopped by Customs officials because a
government computer identified him _ falsely _ as a suspected drug
smuggler.
   Norbert Steyer was taken to a small room at the Dallas airport,
where Customs officials spent a half-hour searching him and poking
through his belongings.
   Steyer eventually received an apology from the Customs Service
and his name was expunged from its TECS II computer system. But the
May 3 episode illustrates what the General Accounting Office called
``deficiencies in controls'' over who is listed as a suspect in the
Customs computer system.
   A GAO report concluded that because of sloppy data-entry
procedures, ``there is an increased risk that known or suspected
law violators may enter the United States undetected and that
innocent persons may be stopped and intensively inspected at the
borders for offenses they did not commit.''
   On July 20, Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett approved new
procedures aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of the
system.
   When someone arrives in the United States, the person's name or
license-plate number is entered into a computer, which cross-checks
the information with records on suspected smugglers, terrorists,
drug traffickers or fugitives.
   A person's name is included in the computer list if an arrest
warrant is pending or authorities suspect the person may commit a
crime or a terrorist act, officials said.
   The computer network, which serves 14 federal agencies, connects
to the FBI's National Crime Information Center system. With records
on 5 million people, TECS II also is being considered by the Bush
administration as the primary computer system for the anti-drug
effort.
   Steyer's case showed the system is fallible.
   The 38-year-old real estate agent from Costa Mesa, Calif. was
listed as a suspected drug smuggler.
   Steyer says that over a three-year period he was searched every
time he returned to the country from a foreign trip.
   ``It has been a real problem for a couple of years,'' said
Steyer. ``It became inconvenient and a hassle because everybody I
travel with ends up being searched as well.''
   Steyer said he finally discovered the reason for the searches
after stepping off the plane in Dallas. ``I happened to glance at
the computer to read it. I got very concerned,'' he said.
   Steyer's lawyer complained to the Customs Service. In June, he
said, the agency wrote a formal apology and promised to purge the
false information from its extensive computer system.
   Customs Service officials declined to comment on Steyer's case,
saying only that problems of mistaken identity are isolated.
   ``Customs is not perfect,'' said spokesman Dennis Shimkowski.
``That is the reason why we do issue letters of apology in the
isolated occasions that mistakes do happen.''
   The spokesman acknowledged the agency receives a steady, though
small, stream of letters from people who say their names don't
belong in the computer.
   But critics of TECS II, short for Treasury Enforcement
Communications System, say Steyer's experience in Dallas last
spring underscores the weaknesses of the electronic network.
   ``Stories of people being detained because of inaccuracies are
rampant,'' said Mark Rotenberg, the Washington director of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, an advocacy group that
studied the FBI's National Crime Information Center.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, looked at 69 records
at the Customs Services' San Ysidro, Calif. checkpoint. It found 41
examples of missing, inaccurate or incomplete information about the
individuals.
   It also found 82 discrepancies between information in the
records and case-file documents.
   Customs objected to some of the findings in the GAO report, but
``we agreed that we need better guidelines for what defines an
accurate and complete record,'' said Rod MacDonald, the agency's
director of enforcement systems.
   The new Customs procedures call for closer review of records
being entered into the computer by Customs Service supervisors,
MacDonald said.
   More than 30,000 people throughout the government have varying
degrees of access to the system. Information also is entered by
other federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and DEA,
officials said.
   Part of the problem is evaluating the accuracy of sketchy tips
from informants. ``You have to make a decision of how good is your
information, MacDonald said.
   ``We want to alert our people there is a potential smuggling
event to take place. We got to get it into the system,'' he said.
   ``If the guy is bad, if he is trying to bring a load of dope
into the country, you certainly don't want to be the one who
doesn't follow up.''
   MacDonald noted a computer ``hit'' does not trigger anything
more than a special search, which many travelers are subjected to
for other reasons.
   ``Our inspection personnel don't take action based on something
in the system alone,'' he said. ``That record in the system may
cause them to start asking questions but our inspectors take no
legal action'' without evidence of wrongdoing.

<HEAD>GOP Hopes Souter Selection Won't Inflame Abortion Issue in '90</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's choice of David H. Souter for
the Supreme Court may help the president avoid further inflaming
the abortion issue in the fall elections. But analysts say it no
more than papers over a fundamental division within the Republican
party.
   While scouring Souter's record for clues to the thinking of this
relatively unknown judge, Democrats privately saluted Bush's savvy
in choosing a man with no fingerprints on the most explosive
political issue of the time.
   Both Democrats and Republicans cautioned, however, that the
Republican Party remains internally split on what to do about
abortion.
   It is a division that threatens the successful electoral
coalition Ronald Reagan bound together, using economic appeals to
unite social conservatives and moderates. And it is one that
inevitably will come to a head, perhaps before Bush comes up for
re-election in 1992.
   Observers also caution that unforeseen information about Souter
could change the political equation at any time.
   ``From a narrow political perspective in 1990, unless something
comes up, undoubtedly he's the safest choice,'' said Eddie Mahe, a
Republican political consultant. ``It clearly keeps the life issue
from being a major topic of debate this year.''
   Abortion is a major issue in some of this year's hottest races:
Iowa's Senate and governor's race and the governors' races in
Florida, Ohio and Texas, are among them. But Mahe and other
Republicans argue that the choice of Souter doesn't raise the
political temperature.
   ``Most people who view abortion as a voting issue are already
activated, on both sides,'' said David Keene, a GOP consultant and
president of the American Conservative Union. ``I don't think
anything's going to happen to change that equation. I think it's a
wash.''
   ``I can imagine nominations that would have increased the
fervor, but I don't think this nominee will decrease the fervor,''
said Gary Bauer, a former Reagan administration official who heads
the anti-abortion Family Research Council.
   Still, the selection of a seeming abortion-neutral nominee only
postpones the GOP's indecision on abortion.
   President Bush embraces the anti-abortion position, although in
his political past he once supported the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   In what could be read as a warning to Bush from the right wing,
Bauer and some others warn that if Souter turns out to be other
than what they hope on abortion, Bush may face trouble within the
party.
   ``If he does not go on the pro-life side, then I think George
Bush would have some problems in 1992, some kind of challenge from
the pro-life side,'' Mahe said.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia said fellow
conservatives should have no problem with a man who was considered
a potential Supreme Court nominee by then-Attorney General Ed Meese
during the Reagan administration.
   ``If David Souter is good enough for Ed Meese and Ronald Reagan,
then he's certainly good enough for me,'' Gingrich said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press'' program Sunday.
   The party continues to have a strongly anti-abortion platform,
pledging dedication to reversing the Roe decision.
   At the same time, the party has several candidates who take the
opposite view and support abortion rights. The GOP suffered
electoral losses in 1989 that were attributed to shifting public
sentiment toward keeping abortion legal in the face of fresh court
challenges.
   The day after Bush announced his choice of Souter, he made a
campaign appearance in Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate
for governor, Barbara Hafer, supports abortion rights.
   Some of the GOP's best chances for capturing Senate seats,
central to the party's hopes of regaining control of that chamber,
are also abortion rights supporters, such as Rep. Lynn Martin in
Illinois and Rep. Claudine Schneider in Rhode Island.
   Bush's Republican National Committee chairman, Lee Atwater, has
tried to make both sides feel welcome. And several groups of
Republicans have formed in an effort to push the party away from
its anti-abortion platform.
   Bob Beckel, a Democratic consultant, said the Souter nomination
means moderate Republicans such as Martin, Schneider and Sen. Pete
Wilson of California, who is running for governor, won't be put on
the spot by having to defend a vote for an ideological,
anti-abortion nominee. Nor will they have to oppose their president.
   ``It's probably on balance pretty good news for any Republican
candidates having to worry about defending right-to-life (court)
candidates,'' Beckel said of Souter's nomination. ``The last thing
Wilson would have wanted in California was having to defend a
hard-right candidate.''
   But the issue could be forced to a head by 1992.
   ``Going past the 1990 elections to 1992, we're going to have a
fairly early opportunity to see where he (Souter) is'' on abortion,
Bauer said.
   Democrats will be trying to put Republicans on the defensive
this fall, of course.
   ``You have all kinds of people running for the Senate who are
going to have to address the question of how they will vote. A lot
of candidates for governor who will have to address the question of
what they would do if the abortion issue comes back to the
states,'' said Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike McCurry.
   Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant for abortion-rights
candidates, said much depends on what picture of Souter emerges
from confirmation hearings.
   If he emerges as a moderate not out to reverse the abortion
decision, Greer said, that could soften the image of the Republican
Party as the anti-abortion party.
   ``If he's perceived as a very conservative selection set to
upset Roe vs. Wade, then I think it's going to hurt Republican
candidates from the congressional level, Statehouses, and Senate
races,'' Greer said.

   Two girls whose small sailboat
capsized in the Mediterranean were rescued by King Juan Carlos, who
dived fully clothed off his own boat and swam over to them, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Diario de Mallorca said the 52-year-old Spanish king, who was
returning to port Saturday aboard a rubber boat after training for
a yacht race, surprised those accompanying him and his security
guards by plunging into the drink when he saw the girls' boat
overturn in heavy winds.
   After helping the two girls, identified only as two Spanish
sisters, to get aboard his rubber boat, the king took them to port
and also towed their boat.
   Naval authorities on the island sent the king a message of
thanks.

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers have been appearing recently
at rest stops on East German highways asking travelers for bread,
chocolate and cigarettes, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Berliner Morgenpost, a West Berlin newspaper, said the
soldiers' appearances at autobahn rest stops were the result of
drastic price rises in East Germany following the July 1 economic
merger of the two Germanys.
   Prices also rose at Red Army commissaries, the newspaper said.
   Quoting unidentified travelers, Morgenpost cited one instance
where two Soviet soldiers, wearing dusty, unkempt uniforms,
approached parked cars asking if the drivers could give them
something to eat or drink.
   To make the event less embarrassing, the newspaper said, one
soldier had a 1-mark piece in his hand to offer as payment.
   Requests have ranged from bread and other types of food to
chocolate, cigarettes, soft drinks and beer, the newspaper said,
adding that more and more drivers were reporting such encounters.
   One driver from Potsdam, at a rest stop near East Berlin, called
the soldiers ``really poor devils who acted like slaves.''

<HEAD>Ten Candidates Vying To Replace Retiring GOP Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma's political history is replete
with knockdown, drag-out Democratic primaries for governor. But
it's the Republicans this year who are mixing it up early in a bid
to keep the governor's office in GOP hands.
   With Gov. Henry Bellmon retiring after one term in office, five
Republicans are in a hotly contested battle for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination in the Aug. 28 primary.
   The Democrats, too, have a five-way primary race, and U.S. Rep.
Wes Watkins is the odds-on favorite, largely because he has raised
a $1.5 million campaign war chest.
   GOP primaries in Oklahoma generally have been ho-hum events.
State GOP Chairman Clinton Key says the fact that this year's race
is hotly contested is a sign that the Republican Party is reaching
maturity.
   ``It shows we have come of age as a party in this state,'' Key
said. ``I can't recall any time when we have had so many viable
candidates.''
   Education, jobs and taxes are among the big issues in the
campaign, and candidates of both parties appear to be taking note
of public sentiment against professional politicians.
   The GOP primary is regarded as a wide-open race between former
federal prosecutor Bill Price and attorney Burns Hargis, with
restaurateur Vince Orza also making his presence felt.
   Hargis has attacked Price's support for repeal of a $223 million
school reform and tax bill enacted at a special legislative
session, saying that killing the measure would create financial
chaos.
   Price, meanwhile, has accused Hargis of violating former
President Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment against speaking ill of
another Republican.
   On the Democratic side, Watkins, 51, has raised nearly three
times as much in campaign contributions as that of any other
opponent and more than Bellmon spent for the entire campaign four
years ago.
   He is the son of itinerant fruit-pickers and likes to tell the
story of his humble beginnings, how he overcame a speech
impediment, worked his way through college, and went on to gain the
House seat that had been held by former House Speaker Carl Albert.
   One Watkins campaign ad in black and white opens with a farm
scene reminiscent of the Dust Bowl. It shows a little boy and the
voice-over says: ``Route 66, from Oklahoma to California. Parents
with little education. Picked fruit to survive. The experts say a
kid from this background _ an outsider _ should be doomed to
failure. But not this kid. Education and gut-tough determination
were his way out.''
   Watkins is expected to be a strong candidate in the rural areas,
but a big question remains on how his homespun style will sell in
metropolitan areas like Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
   A tireless campaigner, Watkins is taking credit for an increase
in jobs in his district and pledging to ``turn the lights back on''
in Oklahoma, a state still recuperating from an economic nose dive
in the early 1980s.
   Watkins stresses that he was not the favorite of established
political leaders when he won a state Senate seat and then was
elected to Congress.
   His main challengers in the primary appear to be House Speaker
Steve Lewis and businessman David Walters, the 1986 Democratic
nominee.
   Lewis' ads say he ushered the school reform and tax bill to
passage, when ``a lot of politicians said `Steve, it will never
pass.'''
   Walters is voicing praise for a proposed constitutional
amendment to limit legislative service to 12 years, saying the
public is tired of career politicians.
   All of the major Democratic candidates have taken pro-choice
stands on the abortion question, while the main contenders for the
GOP nomination _ except Orza _ oppose abortion.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some ways, Toshiki Kaifu resembles that American
vice president of nearly half a century ago who was seen as a
political expedient, a compromise choice destined for a quick
return to obscurity.
   Like Harry S. Truman, Japan's prime minister has proven a
surprisingly resourceful leader during his first year in office.
Kaifu has exhibited a talent for both politics and statesmanship
that, by vastly exceeding expectations, has sent his popularity
booming.
   He has left little doubt, as Give 'em Hell Harry was quick to
do, that he is capable of handling the nation's highest office.
   When Kaifu was chosen last year, he was a career member of
Parliament gien little chance of surviving long in an office
coveted by the governing party's older generation. In the sedentary
politics of Japan, his elders were lined up ahead of him and had
every right to it.
   This time there was a difference: the Recruit bribery and
insider-trading scandal, which tainted nearly all the Liberal
Democratic party elders.
   Kaifu, youthful and untouched, was chosen to fill the position
until the scandal died down. The scandal abated, but Kaifu did not
behave as expected.
   The 59-year-old prime minister has fought off powerful faction
leaders who sought to manipulate his Cabinet, beat a more glamorous
rival in a hard-fought election and won over his Western colleagues
with an aggressive performance at the Houston economic summit.
   A poll published three weeks before his first anniversary in
office Aug. 9, gave his administration a 60 percent approval
rating, the second highest for a Japanese government since World
War II.
   In April 1989, the height of the influence-buying scandal, a
survey indicated only 3.9 percent of the people supported the
government of Noboru Takeshita, then prime minister.
   That came as a shock to the Liberal Democrats, who have governed
Japan since the party was formed 35 years ago.
   Some of the pundits who predicted he would last only a few
months now concede that Kaifu, whose motto is ``Be resolute, and
even the devil will run,'' was the right man for the moment.
   ``A lot of people thought he was weak,'' said Hideo Sato, dean
of International Relations at Tsukuba University. ``Such
expectations turned out not be true. That was psychogically very
important.''
   Many Japanese wanted an end to the political old-boy network
that was generous in protecting big business at the consumer's
expense.
   ``The whole political scene in the last year has made it clear
that the average Japanese citizen is fed up with the old odiferous
poitics as usual,'' said Patricia Steinhoff, former head of the
Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Hawaii.
   Sato said: ``I think people want new leadership not based on
factional power. He's not the maneuvering type. The Japanese people
want a leader to be exercising some sort of leadership, not just
reacting to outside pressure and events.''
   In that respect, he resembles Truman, the compromise choice for
vice president in 1944 who was made president the following year by
the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Like Truman, Kaifu has taken
plainspoken arguments to the people.
   There is less similarity between politics in the two countries.
   In some ways, politics here works less like U.S. constitutional
government than like New York's Tammany Hall early in the century,
when political bosses wielded power by carefully building a web of
personal support based on patronage.
   Japan's political bosses are the leaders of four major factions
in the Liberal Democratic Party. The main danger to Kaifu's future
is the fact that he is wedded to one of two minor factions.
   His rivals for future party leadership, such as former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe and former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
are heads of powerful factions who have remained visible.
   Miyazawa recently led a Japanese mission that met with President
Bush in Washington. The well-traveled Abe will lead a delegation to
Moscow in September.
   Kaifu could stumble on his promises of reform: revision of an
unpopular sales tax, measures to tighten political ethics and
change the national election system and opening Japan's markets to
more foreign goods.
   ``I would say that if he continues to have very high popularity
ratings ... it would be less easy for the LDP to simply elbow him
aside,'' Steinhoff said. ``It's a question of whether he can
sustain it.''

   Making his latest appeal to
kidnappers, Pope John Paul II on Sunday prayed that hostage-takers
be moved by the suffering they've caused and release their victims.
   The pope has periodically appealed to kidnappers, often singling
out specific cases. During his noon prayer before the public in the
courtyard of his summer palace residence here, John Paul cited the
case of an Italian industrialist's wife, Mirella Silocchi, who was
kidnapped a year ago this month.
   Mrs. Silocchi's family and friends led thousands of people
Saturday night in a torchlight vigil outside the cathedral in
Parma, her hometown.
   The Roman Catholic leader made his appeal after wishing those on
vacation a restful holiday and remembering those who cannot go on
vacation: the sick, imprisoned and kidnapped.
   Referring to hostages, the pope prayed that the heart of every
kidnapper be moved by ``the silent suffering of these victims, so
cruelly kept apart, the waiting and the anguish of their families,
the solidarity of all of us, as well as faithful prayer.''

   More than 60 gravestones at a
Jewish cemetery were desecrated by vandals who spray-painted some
of them with Nazi symbols, and police said Sunday they suspected
right-wing radicals.
   Police said Saturday's rampage by vandals at the cemetery did
about $125,000 in damage. Some of the gravestones were
spray-painted with symbols of the Nazi SS or with slogans like
``Jews Out'' and ``The gassing never happened.''
   More than 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, many of
them in the gas chambers of Nazi concentration camps.
   Heinz Galinski, head of the German Jewish community, expressed
outrage over the desecration on Saturday and demanded better
protection for Jewish cemeteries.
   Two weeks earlier, vandals caused similar damage at a gravesite
for victims of the Nazis in Tuebingen, 30 miles south of Stuttgart.
No arrests were made.
   There have been a wave of similar incidents of vandalism. The
most widely publicized was in Carpentras, France, where in May, a
recently buried body was dug up and impaled on an umbrella pole.

   Tamil rebels stormed a mosque and
opened fire, killing 10 worshipers and critically wounding 13,
military officials said Sunday.
   The officials said the massacre took place Saturday when 10 to
15 Tamil rebels entered the mosque in Sammanthurai, 25 miles east
of Batticaloa, the eastern capital.
   The victims were inside the mosque when the shooting began, the
officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was the second attack on a mosque in Sammanthurai during the
past week. The rebels on Tuesday killed four Moslems at another
mosque in that town.
   On Sunday, police found the bodies of 12 Moslem men in a well in
the north-central Anuradhapur district, an opposition leader said.
   Mohammed Ashrof, president of the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress,
said the 12 men were questioned by troops last week. They
disappeared from their homes on Friday and it is unclear who killed
them, he said.
   Moslems, who make up about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's population
of 16 million people, have often become victims in the 7-year-old
war between Tamil rebels and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic
Tamils, who are mostly Hindus.
   The Sri Lankan government and military are dominated by ethnic
Sinhalese who are mostly Buddhists.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Sinhalese comprise 75 percent.
   Military officials said the rebels kill Moslems and burn their
homes and shops because the Moslems support the government in the
civil war.
   Ashrof said, however, that Moslems are kill because they refuse
to take a side in the war.
   In an separate attack Saturday, Tamil rebels ambushed and killed
14 Sinhalese soldiers returning to their camp after patrol duties
in northeastern Sri Lanka, military officials said.
   In the northwest and the north, 10 rebels, two soldiers and
three civilians were killed Saturday in fighting between the rebels
and government forces, the officials said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the insurrection,
which began in 1983.
   About 3,000 people have been killed in the latest round of
fighting, which began June 11 after a 13-month cease-fire.

   Seven officials have been charged in the June 1989
pipeline explosion that blew apart two Trans-Siberian Railroad
trains and killed 575 people, Soviet media reported.
   The officials, who held various managing posts at the time of
the accident, were charged after the Moscow prosecutor's office
completed it investigation, the newspaper Izvestia reported
Saturday. No details of the charges were given.
   The accident occurred June 3, 1989 after a liquefied gas
pipeline exploded between the central Asian city of Ufa and the
town of Asha, 750 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Investigators concluded that the pipeline was built in gross
violation of official standards, the newspaper said. A section of
the pipeline had been damaged by an excavator in 1985, but no one
noticed, it said.
   The pipeline was buried and then leaked, and a spark from an
overhead electric line caused the explosion.
   Two parked trains with 1,200 passengers aboard were engulfed by
a wall of fire. The blast, which was heard 16 miles away, and fire
were so devastating that many of the dead were burned beyond
recognition.
   At least 623 people were injured in the explosion, which caused
$21 million in damage.
   Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the military chief of staff, said the
blast had a force of a 10-kiloton bomb and hurled two locomotives
and 38 passenger cars from the rails.

   The slayings of 15 Palestinians this month for
suspected collaboration with Israel are raising fears among
Palestinian leaders that the uprising is turning on itself in
frustration.
   A statement from a Palestine Liberation Organization official
was published in a Jerusalem weekly criticizing the killings and
saying Arabs should be battling Israelis, not each other.
   The mounting internecine toll is particularly conspicuous
because it contrasts with a marked drop in fatal clashes with
Israeli troops, who have adopted a more restrained strategy in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Just one Palestinian has died in clashes with soldiers in July.
   Analysts blame the increased killings of Palestinians by their
own people on a noticeable slowdown in the 31-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation and its failure to make political gains.
   Israeli politicians have used the killings as ammunition in
their campaign against the PLO, while PLO leaders have expressed
fears the killings are getting out of hand.
   In a statement Friday in Jerusalem's An Nadwa weekly, Intisar
Wazir, a member of the mainstream PLO Fatah faction's central
committee, said Palestinians were undercutting their own cause.
   ``Masked activists who appear during the night and attack
citizens and property must be condemned,'' said Mrs. Wazir, widow
of the PLO military leader Khalil al-Wazir.
   ``The uprising security committees must confront those who hurt
the revolution of stones and endanger its continuation,'' she said
from Amman, Jordan.
   According to figures kept by The Associated Press, 724
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and
45 Isralis have been slain by Palestinians since the uprising began
in December 1987.
   In that time, 243 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs.
   In most cases, the victims have been taken from their homes or
shops by masked Palestinians. They later have been found hanged,
beaten or stabbed to death, and wall slogans or leaflets have
proclaimed them collaborators with Israel.
   Yossi Olmert, director of the government press office, denied
that all of those killed were collaborating. He suggested that
Palestinians involved in crime or family feuds ``try to legitimize
killings by saying they (the victims) are collaborators.''
   Olmert also blamed the PLO for the deaths, charging that they
were aimed at blocking Israeli efforts to cut the PLO out of the
peace process. Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist
organization.
   ``The PLO and its accomplices want to show that no one should be
under the impression he can talk with Israel without being
punished,'' Olmert said.
   The PLO has several times tried to stop the killings. Leaflets
from the local uprising leadership have criticized needless
slayings, and last fall PLO Chief Yasser Arafat issued a radio
appeal during a series of attacks in the West city of Nablus.
   This week in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, slogans appeared on
walls and a leaflet was issued saying a supposed collaborator
killed last Sunday by masked Palestinians was ``an innocent man.''
   The leaflet distributed by Arafat's Fatah faction blamed his
death on ``mercenaries linked with the enemy's (Israel's)
intelligence.''
   ``His killing is our concern because the goal is to hurt the
uprising and its reputation,'' said the leaflet, which pledged to
avenge the attack.
   In another incident, feuding Fatah factions on Thursday
exchanged gunfire and petrol bombs in the village of Salem east of
Nablus.
   Residents told reporters that one faction blamed the other for
kidnapping and badly beating a member suspected of collaboration.
``He is not guilty and he is one of us,'' the activists announced
over loudspeakers before attacking the rival group.
   Daoud Kuttab, a respected Palestinian journalist, blamed the
internal conflict on the stalled peace process.
   Israel has refused any steps toward compromise with the Arabs,
and lately the revolt has drawn less attention abroad.
   ``The Palestinian people need to have something to look forward
to, a realistic goal,'' said Kuttab. ``This hope is fading because
of the failure of the political process.''
   He added: ``This lack of hope and the clever Israeli military
policy of withdrawing and avoiding confrontations have distracted
the people from their common enemy.
   ``The key,'' he said, ``is whether the Palestinian leadership in
the next three to six months can pull itself together and find
courageous solutions.''

   Premier Ante Markovic on Sunday
announced the formation of a political coalition that will unite
all parties committed to the government's reform program.
   Speaking at a rally of 100,000 people on Mount Kozara in central
Yugoslavia, Markovic said the Alliance of Reform Forces would be
registered soon as a political party, and that ``initiative
committees of reform forces can now be set up in every place in the
country.''
   The alliance will include all national and state parties that
support Markovic's radical economic and political program. The
program has been in jeopardy because of open clashes between the
leaders of the country's six republics and two provinces.
   Leaders in two of Yugoslavia's six republics have threatened to
withdraw their states from the Yugoslav federation.
   ``The government has decided to form the Alliance of Reform
Forces of this country to contest'' upcoming federal elections,
Markovic declared in a nationally televised speech.
   Dozens of political parties have been formed in the past year in
this country of half a dozen diverse ethnic groups but almost all
have been based on narrow, nationalistic platforms.
   In the republics of Slovenia and Croatia center-right
nationalist parties defeated the Communists in free elections
earlier this year.
   Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro plan to hold their own free
elections by the end of this year, while the country's largest
republic of Serbia still remains under firm Communist control.

<HEAD>Family Planning Aims for 1 Percent Population Growth</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Couples like Faustino and Gloria
Aquino are one reason Mexican officials are having trouble reducing
population growth.
   Their shop, on a hillside overlooking metropolitan Mexico City,
is next door to a family planning clinic. They have eight children
and are expecting a ninth.
   ``There didn't used to be planning,'' said Aquino, 45. His wife
added: ``Now that there is, we don't practice it.''
   Aquino, his dark eyes twinkling, was leaned against a meat case
at their butcher shop-fruit stand. Gloria, 37, dipped a shet of
pork rind into a vat of smoking fat outside the store.
   An extensive network of family-planning programs shrank Mexico's
annual population growth from 3.5 percent in the early 1970s to an
estimated 2.1 percent.
   Now the goal is 1 percent growth. Officials recently presented a
plan that backed off on that target, but an annoyed president
ordered them back to their original goal.
   It isn't an easy task.
   Aquino jokes with the doctor, Hipolito Ascencio Mateo, at the
clinic next to his butcher shop-fruit stand. Painted sunny yellow,
the clinic occupies two rooms rented to it by Aquino.
   But the Aquinos don't avail themselves of its services. Aquino
says he is afraid to have a vasectomy, and his wife Gloria, 37,
says her body won't tolerate contraceptives.
   Their children range in age from 1 to 19.
   A well-publicized family planning program quickly reaches half
the women, those who want to limit their families and are waiting
for the means to do it, said Evold Hosein, director of program
support for the International Planned Parenthood Federation.
   ``That figure stabilizes unless we do something differently,''
he said by telephone from New York. ``We're not sure what it is
that we must do differently.''
   About 55 percent of Mexican women of reproductive age use
contraceptives, according to the Health Department. The number
varies widely by education level and between rural areas and the
cities.
   Young families with only two children, once an oddity, are
becoming common in large cities.
   Abortion is illegal, but common. Although Mexico is
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the church does not actively oppose
family planning.
   The 1 percent annual growth goal was in 1977, four years after
the constitution was changed from advocating births to promoting
family planning, and the sale of contraceptives was legalized.
   To reduce population growth to that level, 82 percent of fertile
women will have to use contraceptives, more than in the United
States or China, government demographers say. The number of
children a woman bears must decline from an average of 3.4 this
year to 1.67 in 1999.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari links reducing population
growth to development.
   ``The social needs and economic demands, especially for job
creation, are too many for us to abandon this original goal of 1
percent demographic growth by the year 2000,'' he said in February.
``Even reaching it, the challenges will be formidable; imagine if
we don't achieve it.''
   He spoke after officials admitted missing earlier marks and
proposed a goal of 1.5 percent a year. That would put the
population at 105 million in 2000, about 4 million more than at
Salinas' pace, according to estimates made before the 1990 census.
   In a rare public reprimand, Salinas singled out the three
largest public health services.
   ``Your effort has diminished and, as a consequence, we have to
redouble it, especially in rural areas,'' he said. The director of
the National Population Program was replaced.
   Mexico is emerging from deep depression and has difficulty
providing education, public services and utility installations.
With half the population under age 19, more than 800,000 people
enter the job market each year.
   In May, the United Nations said in its annual population report
world fertility rates were declining more slowly than expected. The
1990s will determine whether the world population of 5.3 billion
doubles or triples before leveling off, said Dr. Nafis Sadik,
director of the U.N. Population Fund.
   Uncertain figures make it even harder to chart Mexico's growth.
   Preliminary figures from the 1990 census, released Friday, show
the population is 81.1 million, more than 4 million below earlier
government projections. The validity of the estimated population
growth rate has been questioned, said a public health official who
asked not to be identified, and the announcement gave no new
current growth figure.
   Jesus Kumate, the health secretary, calls for better education
and job opportunities for women, more local health workers to
insert intrauterine devices, increased sex education in schools and
a subsidy for an injectable contraceptive developed in Mexico.
   Aquino, whose youngest children were playing at his feet, said
he approved of Salinas' objective ``because that way everyone will
be able to eat the same.''
   ``After this next one,'' he said, ``we're going to stop.''

   After months of screaming headlines,
closed-door hearings and ``tell-all'' articles in adult magazines,
sex and prostitution wound up having little to do with the House
reprimand of Rep. Barney Frank.
   That Frank paid prostitute Stephen L. Gobie $80 for sex in 1985
and then allowed him free access to his Capitol Hill apartment
played almost no role in the punishment meted out to Frank.
   What mattered to the House was Frank's word.
   Frank lied twice in a document he prepared under his
congressional letterhead which was sent by a friend to a Virginia
prosecutor overseeing Gobie's probation on sex and drug
convictions. Frank lied about how he met Gobie and he lied when he
wrote that, as far as he knew, Gobie was obeying the law.
   As Congress becomes increasingly inured to sex violation
allegations against its own, and as homosexuality diminishes as an
issue unto itself in public life, the enduring problem for Frank
among his peers may be his own credibility.
   Frank, already back to his old feisty self, discounts talk of
any long-term damage.
   ``If this was the first thing people knew about me then it might
have that sort of effect,'' Frank said after Friday's reprimand.
Earlier, on the House floor, he said, ``I have a reputation for
honesty.''
   If anything, the homosexual nature of Frank's relationship
benefited the Massachusetts Democrat. Frank himself said he wrote
the misleading statements on the 1986 memo because to do otherwise
would have revealed his homosexuality. It was a year later, in June
1987, that Frank publicly stated that he is homosexual.
   The committee's interpretation of the memo received relatively
little attention during floor debate. The committee said Frank
failed to mention Gobie's prostitution in the memo _ and the fact
that he met Gobie by answering an ad for an escort service _ in
order to help Gobie avoid a longer probation on sex and drug
charges.
   During last week's floor debate, Democrats and Republicans alike
repeatedly said that the sexual aspects surrounding the case had
nothing to do with Frank's punishment.
   ``The issue was not the sexual preference of Barney Frank. The
issue was conduct,'' Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who led an
unsuccessful effort to expel Frank, said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press'' program.
   ``This should not be perceived as a referendum on purely private
lifestyle or conduct,'' said Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman
of the ethics committee.
   ``Gay bashing just isn't popular among respectable people any
more,'' said Christopher Foreman Jr., a congressional expert at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``It's not
surprising that allegations or revelations that would have been
shocking or damaging no longer are.''
   Frank's reputation as a champion of progressive causes also gave
him a built-in group of allies in the House, some of whom made a
point of sitting beside and around him during the debate.
   ``This wasn't just member `X' _ this was Barney,'' Foreman said.
``Were this some other individual who were less well liked, less
well respected as a person and for his intellect, things might have
gone quite differently.''
   Politically, Frank appears to have a smooth road ahead of him.
His most serious Republican opponent dropped out of the race
recently, citing personal reasons. That leaves an unknown
Attleboro, Mass., attorney as his only opponent.
   Even the challenger, John Soto, acknowledged that the reprimand
amounted to ``a victory'' for Frank. Soto continues to argue that
Frank's behavior warrants his departure from Congress.
   In Washington, Frank was already getting back into the daily
life of a member of Congress. On Friday he attended legislative
hearings and this week he plans to take part in floor debate on
housing legislation.
   Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Political Report, a
Washington-based periodical, said Frank began his recovery from the
ethics allegations months ago. And to some degree, he said, he used
the points in the ethics report that upheld his own claims to his
advantage.
   Frank particularly emphasized that the committee concluded he
was unaware that Gobie was running a prostitution ring out of his
apartment and that the two did not have sex in the House gymnasium
_ two of the more sensational charges.
   ``Barney put a good spin on it, from his point of view,''
Rothenberg said. ``Barney Frank's a tough cookie. He knows how to
play politics.''

<BYLINE>Soviet Cigarette Shortage: After the Cold War _ Cold Turkey?
^By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets have grudgingly endured scarcities of
soap, sugar and shoes. But they are fuming at an economy that has
stubbed out their supply of cigarettes.
   What is being called the worst cigarette shortage in decades has
some smokers doing a slow burn in lines of more than 200 people,
while others are expressing their anger with strikes,
demonstrations and vandalism.
   ``Communist Party _ Give Us a Light!'' proclaimed a sign at a
rally of angry smokers last week in the Ural Mountains city of Perm.
   Government officials are blaming the shortage, which began more
than a month ago, on various reasons: factories that are shut down
for annual summer repairs; a lack of paper, foil, glue and cotton
supplies to make the cigarettes; ethnic unrest disrupting a factory
in Armenia that produced cotton filters; and reduced purchases of
cigarettes from Bulgaria, a key supplier for the Soviet Union.
   Hard-core addicts are picking up butts in the streets, puffing
dried tea leaves or buying tobacco dust that gardeners use as an
insecticide, according to the Worker's Tribune newspaper.
   ``Three times I've tried to quit, but I almost went mad,'' said
Viktor Mayorov as he waited in line for cigarettes in Moscow.
``Tobacco is much worse than vodka. My God, it's worse! I can do
without vodka but I can't do without cigarettes.''
   The pungent odor of cheap tobacco hangs in most public places in
the Soviet Union, a country of 70 million smokers who persist in
lighting up despite government warnings and kick-the-habit
campaigns in the West.
   The shortage has pushed black market prices up. They range from
$4.80 for a pack of the most inferior, non-filter brand _ about 10
times its official, state-subsidized price _ to $12.80 for a pack
in Perm's central market.
   Perm's ``tobacco rebellion'' began at 6 p.m. on July 26 when up
to 1,000 people gathered on Lenin Street in front of a smoke shop
that hasn't sold cigarettes for days. They blocked trams, cars and
trucks, according to the Interfax news service.
   The Worker's Tribune reported that the crowd grew angry, calling
for bureaucrats to come out of their offices; one person suggested
smashing the windows of city hall.
   A strike committee of 12 was formed, went to city hall and
demanded that authorities straighten out the problem, Interfax
said. By 7 p.m., the authorities had produced 12,000 packs of
cigarettes from an army garrison, which were sold to the dispersing
crowd, it added.
   ``We have to admit that the situation with the sale of
cigarettes has gotten out of control,'' G. Karavayev, the head of
the regional government, told the Worker's Tribune. ``But who could
think that such things could happen just because of cigarettes?''
   Soviet media have chronicled the smoldering discontent:
   _Combines halted during the harvest near the Russian city of
Krasnodar in early July as farmworkers protested the lack of
cigarettes. Similar strikes have been threatened or have occurred
in the western Russian cities of Kuibyshev, Berezhniki, Ulyanovsk,
Lipetsk and Ufa.
   _Smokers tired of lining up for cigarettes blocked the main
thoroughfare in the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk on July 23,
demanding that authorities restore order in cigarette sales.
   _In the city of Voronezh, more than 15 street kiosks were broken
into in an apparent search for cigarettes in the latter half of
July, according to V. Zvyagintsev, head of Soyuzpechat, which runs
the newsstands.
   _An aircraft factory in Kuibyshev has a plane prepared to fly to
whatever city is selling cigarettes.
   ``I have heard on the radio about those strikes, like in
Kuibyshev, and I think they are right,'' grumbled Valentina V.
Nikonorova, 36th in a line of 58 at a tobacco kiosk two blocks from
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   The 17-year-old Muscovite said she sometimes waits in line for
more than an hour as an unofficial rationing system in Moscow
limits city residents to five packs per person and out-of-towners
to two packs per person. She claimed authorities were stockpiling
cigarettes at storehouses.
   Izvestia reported that 16 out of 24 cigarette factories have
closed for repairs in the Russian republic alone. It said there
were 17 billion fewer cigarettes produced in the first half of
1990, compared with last year.
   Economic planners saw the shortage coming last year, but they
could do nothing because of a lack of hard currency, Izvestia
reported.
   The Soviet Union also bought 5 billion fewer cigarettes from
Bulgaria this year, Izvestia said, apparently because of its hard
currency problems. On July 21, the Council of Ministers decided to
dip into its reserves and buy more cigarettes from India and
elsewhere, promising relief in a month.
   ``According to our newspapers, almost all Americans have quit
smoking,'' said a man who gave his name as Leonid, who went without
cigarettes for five hours before he finally got a pack. ``So it's
time for us to do the same.''

   Four years ago, President Samuel Doe asked the
United States for an unusual favor: would it fix Liberia's budget
mess?
   The administration agreed, sending 17 experts to Monrovia. Doe
spent 10 minutes with them. Said one U.S. official, Doe's
``interest in this didn't last very long.''
   Nor did the two-year project. The United States brought the
experts home midway, frustrated with Doe's insistence on keeping
much of his budget outside government control.
   That was the final break in the bond that has tied the United
States to Liberia since that nation was founded in the 1840s by
Africa slaves set free from American plantations.
   And in recent weeks, as rebels threaten Doe's rule and his life,
the United States appears to have washed its hands of the problem.
   ``The resolution of this civil war is a Liberian
responsibility,'' Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said in
recent congressional testimony. The United States ``will not
intervene to stop the fighting or to influence the outcome of the
conflict in any way.''
   The seeds of the deterioration were sown when William Tolbert,
the strongly pro-Western president of Liberia, was overthrown in
1980 by master sergeant Doe and a band of non-commissioned officers.
   Tolbert, a member of a tiny urban elite that traces its ancestry
to Liberia's founders, was shot and disemboweled by Doe's followers
_ poorly educated tribesmen resentful of the minority's monopoly on
power.
   ``We had two options: walking away, or trying to deal with this
new group of people,'' said a U.S. official. ``We decided the
historical relationship dictated that we remain engaged.''
   History wasn't the only factor.
   Libya was making overtures to Doe in the early days of his rule,
and the United States wanted to make sure he didn't respond.
   Liberia was considered important to the United States as a
buffer against the spread of Soviet influence in Africa, which was
at its height in the early 1980s. And, the United States had much
invested in Liberia.
   Two U.S. facilities relayed diplomatic communications from
Washington to U.S. embassies in Africa, the Voice of America
relayed its broadcasts to Africa through a station in Liberia, a
military airfield was always available for use by American
aircraft, and a tracking station run by the Coast Guard emitted
navigational signals for U.S. shipping.
   Little wonder, then, that U.S. aid to Liberia more than tripled:
from $19.1 million in 1979 to $61.4 in 1981. And special attention
was paid to making the military _ Doe's mainstay _ happy. For
example, the United States built new barracks for his troops.
   In return, Doe promised to restore an independent judicial
system and hold elections.
   He did so in 1985, but the balloting was fraudulent _ all agree,
including the United States. They disagree about the scale.
   Human rights organizations and domestic critics complained of
wholesale fraud and ballot burning. But the United States argued
that by announcing he only won 51 percent of the vote, Doe conceded
a sizable opposition.
   ``That was a slap in the face to us, a complete insult,'' said
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, an opposition senate candidate who served as
finance minister until Doe took over.
   ``The Reagan administration's policy engendered a sense of
betrayal among Liberians across a broad spectrum,'' said Michael H.
Posner of the New York-based Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights.
   An aborted coup against Doe in November 1985 unleashed
widespread repression, including executions and imprisonments
without trial, torture and suppression of press freedom.
   The administration cajoled Doe in private to mend his ways, but
in public, criticism was withheld and even some praise awarded.
   ``Foreign policy is not about getting up on soapboxes. We don't
think it particularly effective,'' said the U.S. official.
   Congress, however, was fed up. Starting in 1986 lawmakers began
whittling away at aid to Liberia until in fiscal year 1990 it was
down to $7.5 million _ food aid only. The administration,
despairing of Doe and bowing to the inevitable from Congress,
suspended all military aid in 1989.
   In recent months, the administration focused its efforts on
trying to get Doe to negotiate with the rebels. That didn't worked,
either.
   The administration offered Doe one last favor: if Doe asked, and
if the fighting that approached his palace was not a danger to
American lives, U.S. officials would escort him to asylum in
another African nation.
   ``Doe ignored our urgings,'' the U.S. official said. ``There's
nothing more we can do.''

   One Cuban woman in her 80s can probably sum up as
well as anyone what's good and bad about Cuba's revolution these
days.
   She hurt her back in a bathtub fall, and she'll be laid up for
three months. She lavishly praises her doctors, using words like
``magnificant'' to describe her care under Cuba's free medical
system.
   But don't ask this woman, who did not want her name used, what
it's like to go shopping for food.
   ``No hay nada,'' she says _ there's nothing. It's a common
refrain these days.
   A dozen Cubans interviewed in recent days agreed that food has
seldom _ if ever _ been so scarce.
   Not far from the elderly woman's home, plantains and pineapples
were the only items available for 100 or so people lined up at a
local market. At a market next door, the shelves were almost empty.
   A joke making the rounds alludes to the mathematical impact of a
recent 15 cent increase in the price of eggs: H &plus; H@15 x 10H &equals;
MS90.
   Translated, that means hunger plus 15-cent eggs times 10 hours
of work a day equals certain death _ muerte seguro _ in 1990.
   To Cubans, a line for food means there's probably something to
buy at the end of it. They worry when there's no line because that
means nothing's available.
   The more fortunate households have one or more retired people,
who spend their twilight years standing in line buying food. That
spares the rest of the family from the time-consuming duty of
buying food.
   This spring, a local Communist Party leader exhorted her
neighbors at a meeting not to complain publicly about shortages
because that would only benefit American imperialism.
   But a few weeks later, the same woman was heard complaining
loudly about the meager selection at a market. A fellow shopper
reminded her of her earlier admonition. ``The situation has become
intolerable,'' she responded.
   Waiting in line at a market the other day, several women
expressed outrage that the government had invited to Cuba for an
extended stay some Russian children who were fallout victims of the
nuclear disaster at Chernobyl four years ago.
   The women all agreed that they had nothing against the children
but felt that the government should put the interests of Cuban
children ahead of those of foreign children.
   In some ways, though, Cuban children are better off than
children elsewhere.
   The government has worked hard to keep down the rate of infant
mortality, a scourge in much of the Third World. Official tallies
indicate that the figure nowadays is 11.1 per 1,000, which compares
favorably with wealthy industrialized countries.
   President Fidel Castro cites the lowered infant mortality rate,
saying that if not for the revolution, 300,000 Cubans would not be
alive today.
   So extensive is Cuba's ability to deliver medical services that
increasing numbers of middle-class Latin Americans, unable to get
proper care at home and unable to afford treatment in the United
States, come to Cuba.
   This phenomenon, known as ``health tourism,'' attracted 1,200
foreigners to Cuban hospitals and clinics last year, according to
official figures. The country also has had some success with
earning hard currency through the export of vaccines.
   Castro has spoken of turning Cuba into a ``medical power.''
   Still, even the health system here is draws some of the same
kind of criticism heard at food markets: many medicines are simply
nowhere to be found.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people demonstrated in the
capital Sunday, demanding President Hussain Muhammad Ershad resign
and hold free national elections.
   The daylong rallies and processions were organized by four major
political opposition groups. Witnesses said about 20,000 people
took part in the four separate rallies.
   ``Down with autocracy! Fight for democracy!'' the demonstrators
chanted as they marched through the city before gathering in
central Dhaka to hear their leaders speak.
   Sunday's rallies capped a 17-day opposition campaign against
Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a bloodless coup
in March 1982.
   Begum Khaleda Zia, the leader of a seven-party opposition
alliance, told one rally that people must unite to establish
democracy in the country.
   Anti-Ershad rallies were reported in at least three other towns.
   Ershad has said he is willing to hold talks with the opposition
to ensure next year's presidential polls are fair. But opposition
leaders say they will boycott the elections unless Ershad steps
down first and hands over power to a caretaker government.
   Muzzafar Ahmed, leader of an eight-party alliance, said people
do not believe Ershad will hold fair elections.
   ``It is almost certain that (Ershad) will steal votes as he did
in the past,'' he said.
   Ershad has said he will contest the May 1991 presidential
elections. The next parliamentary polls are not scheduled before
1993.
   Bangladesh, a nation of 110 million people, has been bufetted by
political turmoil since it was created in 1971. More than 17
military coup attempts were made up until Ershad, then the army
chief, took over.
   A fractious opposition has been struggling since November 1987
to unseat the government, accusing it of corruption and
inefficiency.
   The last three national polls were marred by vote fraud and
violence blamed on Ershad's Jatiya, or People's Party.

<TEXT>
   Nearly one in four state inmates in prison for
killing someone committed the crime against a close relative or
intimate friend, according to a Justice Department report released
Sunday.
   Almost 60 percent of prisoners serving time during 1986 for a
violent crime did not know the victim, said the Bureau of Justice
Department Statistics.
   At the same time, only 43 percent imprisoned that year killed
strangers and 24 percent killed a close relative or intimate
friend, according to the report.
   And almost one of every six of the offenders committed a violent
crime against a minor, the bureau said. Slightly more than half of
the sex offenders reported their victim was younger than 18.
   The 245,562 male and female offenders serving time in state
prisons for crimes of violence had victimized a total of 408,936
people. In all, they killed about 79,300, sexually assaulted
51,100, robbed 201,200 and assaulted 56,400, the report said.
   Minors made up about 10 percent of the victims, totaling more
than 40,000. Of those victims, 71 percent were raped or sexually
assaulted, according to the report.
   As for the crimes that landed them in prison, about 27 percent
of the inmates had committed a homicide and 38 percent had
committed a robbery, most of them armed.
   Another 16 percent had sexually assaulted someone, 15 percent
had committed assault, and 4.5 percent had committed another
violent crime, primarily kidnapping.
   The findings were based on a survey of a representative sample
of 13,711 inmates.
   Three-quarters of those imprisoned for violent crimes said they
had victimized one person on their current imprisonment offense,
almost 16 percent said they had two victims, and just over 10
percent said they had victimized three or more people.
   Some statistics differed for men and women. For example, while
only 26 percent of the men in state prison for a violent crime had
killed someone, homicide was the reason why almost half of the
women imprisoned for a violent crime had been incarcerated, the
study found.
   A separate report on family voilence released Sunday by the
Justice Department's National Institute of Justice said FBI figures
showed that 30 percent of female murder victims in 1986 were killed
by their husbands or boyfriends.

   Nelson Mandela accused the
government Sunday of using an alleged Communist conspiracy to delay
peace talks. He spoke before tens of thousands of people
celebrating the launch of the South African Communist Party.
   Mandela said the government was trying to whip up hysteria with
claims that Communist members of his African National Congress had
plotted to seize power.
   ``To suggest ... that these outstanding sons and daughters of
our people harbor ideas of unilateral military action against the
peace process is an insult manufactured by the enemies of
democracy,'' Mandela said.
   ``If it is genuinely interested in peace and negotiations, the
government must act to bring about this result,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela also stressed that the ANC was not a Marxist movement,
although many Communists hold senior positions in the ANC.
   ``They have never sought to transform the ANC into a tool and
puppet of the Communist Party,'' Mandela said.
   Police claim Communists and militants within the ANC's military
wing have stockpiled weapons and were formulating plans to seize
power if talks between the government and the ANC on ending
white-minority rule fail.
   Government officials in Pretoria said they were studying
Mandela's charges and had no immediate response. Communist Party
officials said they were committed to a negotiated solution to
South Africa's racial divisions.
   President F.W. de Klerk has reportedly asked Mandela to drop the
Communists from the talks. The ANC and the government are to meet
Aug. 6 to try and clear the way for full-scale negotiations.
   About 35,000 people, nearly all of them black, turned out for
the rally marking the Communist Party's move into mainstream
politics after being banned for 40 years by the South African
government.
   Thousands sang, chanted slogans and waved red hammer-and-sickle
flags during the rally, held at a football stadium in the black
township of Soweto outside Johannesburg.
   ``Viva, South African Communist Party, Viva!'' the crowd roared.
   Despite the enthusiasm of the crowd, the turnout in the
70,000-seat stadium appeared smaller than organizers had predicted.
   Communist officials told the crowd ``many'' people had been
stopped from attending, but gave no details.
   Witnesses said police used tear gas to disperse small crowds of
youths who tried to march after the rally, but there were no
serious clashes. Police had no comment on the report.
   Mandela received a huge ovation when he arrived with Communist
Party secretary general Joe Slovo and other top party leaders.
   Slovo also denied the charges of a Communist plot, calling it an
``outright and deliberate lie.''
   He indirectly defended the opposition's right to wage an armed
struggle against racial injustice, however.
   ``Until the police stop hunting blacks ... we have a right not
only to protest, but to defend ourselves,'' he said.
   Slovo said South Africa's Communists were hated by many whites
because of their long fight against apartheid.
   ``They fear us even more than the devil,'' he said.
   Slovo said the Communists in South Africa supported democracy,
and acknowledged that the party's authoritarian approach elsewhere
_ such as in Eastern Europe _ had failed.
   ``But at least many socialists recognize some of the mistakes
and misdeeds,'' he said.
   Jai Naidoo, a trade union leader, said democracy and socialism
were the same thing. ``Apartheid is proved to the most brutal and
inhuman form of capitalism the world has ever seen,'' he said.
   The party introduced its internal leadership for the first time,
including Chris Hani, head of the ANC's military wing. At least
half of those presented are also prominent ANC officials.
   But the party is keeping the identity of some top leaders secret
for ``strategic reasons.''
   De Klerk legalized the Communist Party, the ANC and other
opposition groups in February to help set the stage for the talks
on sharing power with the black majority.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters demanding immediate
registration of political groups for multiparty elections were
blocking trains at a railroad hub in the republic of Georgia, it
was reported Sunday.
   Georgia's Communist Party leader was quoted as warning
protesters that they are inviting the use of force to break up the
demonstration.
   The protest, which began Thursday, has stranded 30 passenger
trains and 90 freight trains laden with wheat, oil, sugar, meat and
gasoline at the Samtredia railway junction of the trans-Caucasian
railroad, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   The junction is about 125 miles northwest of Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital.
   The protesters _ numbering about 700, according to the
unofficial Postfactum news service _ are demanding the Georgian
parliament, or Supreme Soviet, convene immediately to adopt a law
to register groups for Oct. 28 elections.
   Parliament is not scheduled to meet until Aug. 17.
   The protest ``destabilizes the situation, bears heavily on the
socio-economic life of the republic and aggravates its critical
position,'' the republic's government warned in a statement.
   ``Confrontation of force is not ruled out, which may lead to
anarchy, chaos and to hard, unpredictable consequences,'' said a
statement by Communist Party leader Givi Gumbaridze published in
the capital of Tbilisi and quoted by Pravda.
   Gumbaridze urged protesters ``to show the maximum political
prudence and responsibility, strictly observe the current laws in
order to prevent a further complication of the situation and avert
a threat to civil peace,'' Pravda said.
   On April 9, 1989, Soviet soldiers moved into a crowd of peaceful
demontrators in Tbilisi and killed 19 of them. A patrol shot a 20th
person for violating curfew.
   Gumbaridze became Georgian leader after that, and has spoken out
for more autonomy for the republic.
   The June 17 election was postponed by Georgia's parliament in
order to introduce a multiparty system and permit opponents to
organize against the ruling communists.
   On March 9, the Caucasus republic joined the other republics
trying to break with the Kremlin. Its parliament condemned what it
called the republic's forcible annexation into the Soviet Union in
the 1920s and demanded negotiations on restoring independence.
   Several small pro-independence parties have been pressing hard
for Georgian secession for more than a year.
   Pro-independence groups have done well in local elections this
year elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   Georgia's parliament also struck the article of the republic's
constitution granting the Communist Party a monopoly on political
power. The amended constitution gives all political parties and
public organizations the right ``on an equal basis to take part in
working out the policies of the government, in managing government
and public affairs.''
   The People's Front political movement had sought the change,
arguing such a provision already had been dropped from the national
law.

<HEAD>Inmates at Four Prisons Protest Pardon for Convicted Terrorist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inmates at four French prisons refused to return to
their cells Sunday to protest a presidential pardon granted to a
convicted terrorist whose release was sought by Iran.
   In some cases the prisoners demanded similar pardons.
   In Tehran, where convicted terrorist Anis Naccache and his four
accomplices flew after their release, a top Iranian official
praised France's move as a ``humanitarian gesture.''
   Naccache had served 10 years of a life sentence for the failed
assassination of Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   A policeman and a passer-by were killed and another policeman
paralyzed in the 1980 assassination attempt in Paris.
   Naccache was allegedly acting on Iranian orders and his
imprisonment has been a major object of contention between France
and Iran.
   Mahmoud Vaezi, deputy Iranian foreign minister in charge of
Euro-American affairs, told France's Ambassador to Iran, Christian
Graffe, that the pardoning of Naccache would have a positive impact
on Lebanese Moslem groups, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, mainly by
pro-Iranian groups.
   They include six Americans. The longest-held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In France, five employees of the Caen prison were slightly
injured in incidents Saturday night sparked by the pardon, prison
officials said. None was hospitalized.
   Several hundred inmates at Ensisheim in eastern France,
Loos-Les-Lille in the north, Baumettes in Marseille and Caen in
Normandy all refused to return to their cells following the evening
exercise period Saturday. Calm was restored by early Sunday morning.
   In each case, officials said, the prisoners were protesting the
pardon of Naccache and his accomplices.
   Police took up positions around Ensisheim Prison, near Mulhouse,
as up to 180 inmates spent five hours outside their cells.
   At Loos-Les-Lille, about 150 inmates remained in the courtyard
for an hour after exercise, demanding to be pardoned like Naccache.

   Former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky,
Austria's longest-serving chancellor and an architect of its
poliicy of neutrality, died Sunday. He was 79.
   Kreisky was admitted to Lainz Hospital last week with a heart
condition, which seriously worsened over the weekend. He died of
heart failure at 6 a.m., Wolfgang Enenkel, a doctor at the hospital
said.
   A Jew, Kreisky was forced to flee Austria from the Nazis but
returned to become its longest-serving chancellor.
   Kreisky won an absolute majority in Parliament for his ruling
Socialist Party three consecutive times in the 1970s representing
``a lone record in the free democratic world,'' the Austria Press
Agency reported.
   With Kreisky's death, ``Austria loses one of its most
distinguished postwar politicians, European democracy one of its
most convincing leading figures, the Socialist International one of
its most highly esteemed honorary presidents,'' said former West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said: ``I believe it is no
exaggeration when I say that we have lost with Bruno Kreisky one of
the greatest Austrian politicians of this century.''
   Condolences were received from around the world, including from
PLO chief Yasser Arafat. Kreisky was the first Western leader to
receive Arafat.
   During his tenure as chancellor from 1970 to 1983, Kreisky took
advantage of Austria's unique position between Eastern Europe and
Western Europe to carved out a mediating role which gave his tiny
nation unexpected prominence.
   He drew criticism abroad, especially from Israel, for his Middle
East policies and his ties with Arafat. He was also criticized for
receiving Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and freeing Arab terrorists
who attacked the Vienna headquarters of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1975.
   But he was also widely respected in Europe as one of the leading
postwar Socialists.
   At home, Kreisky was an adored, if irascible, figure who
skillfully handled the press.
   Born Jan. 22, 1911, the son of a wealthy industrialist, Kreisky
was forced to flee his native Vienna in 1938 after the Nazis _
cheered by many Austrians _ annexed the nation to Germany.
   He went to Sweden, where he first met fellow Brandt, who was
living in exile.
   There, he married Vera Fuerst. The couple had two children,
Peter, born in 1944, and Susanne, born in 1948, who survive him.
His wife died in 1988.
   Kreisky returned to Vienna in 1949 and entered the government in
1953 as state secretary in the Foreign Ministry. He served as
foreign minister from 1959 to 1966, and became chancellor in 1970.
   It was the Socialists' failure to win a clear majority in the
1983 elections that led Kreisky to step down and hand over the
party leadership.
   But foreign policy was Kreisky's passion.
   A longtime champion of East-West detente, Kreisky espoused the
idea of a common Europe long before Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev coined his phrase ``a common European house.''
   Kreisky sought improved relations with Austria's then-Communist
neighbors, although he did not shy away from sharply criticizing
human rights violations in the Soviet bloc. He also helped
establish Austria's liberal policy of granting asylum to tens of
thousands of refugees from Eastern Europe.
   ``The Austrians' task is to win maximum trust in the West, and
at the same time only evoke a minimum of mistrust in the East,''
Kreisky once said.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   The first person ever charged under
Australia's war crimes legislation, a 74-year-old retired man, was
shot and wounded Sunday night, the eve of his trial.
   Two passers-by found Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich about a
block from his home in Adelaide's western suburbs. He was
tentatively listed in stable condition and was to undergo surgery
for a chest wound at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
   Polyukhovich has been charged with 24 counts of murder and with
involvement in the deaths of 850 other people in the Ukraine during
World War II.
   Police spokesman Bill Lonie said the circumstances surrounding
the shooting were unclear and the incident was under investigation.
   Police, however, said earlier that there were indications the
wound was self-inflicted.
   Early this year Polyukhovich became the first person charged
under Australia's War Crimes Act, which was passed by the Federal
Parliament in December 1988.
   His trial was due to begin Monday morning in Adelaide.

<HEAD>PLO Fighters Capture Two Hills in Lebanese Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrillas wrested two key
hills from Iranian-backed fundamentalists Sunday in savage combat
that forced the Red Cross to cancel a plan to remove decomposing
corpses from the battlefield.
   Police said at least 35 combatants were killed and 90 wounded in
36 hours of fighting for the Hamadeh and Sakhriah hills near the
zone Israel occupies in south Lebanon. That raised the toll to 180
dead and 536 wounded since the region erupted in violence on July
16.
   The casualties included seven Palestinian dead and 12 wounded.
The rest were Lebanese militiamen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
and the pro-Syrian Amal, said a police spokesman who by regulation
cannot be named.
   Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas
intervened on Amal's side in an attack launched before dawn
Saturday to dislodge Hezbollah from the strategic village of Kfar
Milki, the spokesman said.
   The Sakhriah and Hamadeh hills above Kfar Milki command all
supply routes to Hezbollah's 50-member garrison holed up in the
village, whose 5,000 inhabitants have already fled their homes
seeking refuge in Sidon.
   Kfar Milki is six miles southeast of Sidon, where the PLO has
its main bases. The fighting later spread to Jarjou on the
southeastern edge of Hezbollah's enclave in the Apple Province.
   The region covers 50 square miles of rocky highlands on the
northern flank of the zone Israel carved out in 1985 as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla raids.
   Israel's chief of staff, Gen. Dan Shomron, toured the zone
Sunday and told reporters Israel was closely watching the progress
of the Amal-Hezbollah fighting.
   ``We shall not interfere in Lebanon's domestic wars unless it
develops into a threat endangering us,'' Shomron said, according to
the radio station of the Israeli-funded South Lebanon Army militia.
   Hezbollah and the more secular Amal, Arabic for hope, have been
fighting on and off for three years for mastery of the 1.2 million
Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest sect. More than 1,200 have
been killed and 4,000 wounded in the inconclusive power struggle.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross called
for a four-hour ``mercy cease-fire'' Sunday morning to allow Red
Cross teams to evacuate corpses that have been rotting for days in
Jarjou.
   But the fighting raged without letup, forcing the Red Cross to
call off the mission and withdraw its rescuers and ambulances
waiting in hills near Jarjou back to Sidon, 25 miles south of

   An International Committee and Lebanese Red Cross statement

   When the final vote on the 1990 farm bill was
taken on the Senate floor it was a time for tears or cheers for
about 200 special spectators.
   Special interest spectators, that is.
   Ralph Page, a lobbyist for minority farmers, rushed into the
anteroom of the Senate floor joyfully punching the air with his
fist.
   ``We got it,'' he said as he rushed to a small knot of
colleagues among the 40 or so lobbyists milling about.
   He threw a bear hug around a Senate aide to express his pleasure
at the Senate's unanimous approval of an amendment to the farm bill
that sets up a program to end racial discrimination in Agriculture
Department programs and halt the decline in numbers of minority
farmers.
   Others had less to crow about last Friday.
   Sam White, of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association,
had been working the bill until 2 a.m. the night before and was up
at five Friday morning for a breakfast meeting.
   But the Senate didn't go along with his efforts to change a
section of the bill that bans export of pesticides that are
unregistered in the United States.
   The lobbyists that are a part of any legislative process were
out in force for the $54 billion farm bill which passed the Senate
70-21 on Friday.
   They're still on the job as they try to educate, cajole and
seduce members of the House into their way of thinking on the
issues still unfinished by that body. Then they'll start working on
the conference committee members assigned to put the two bills
together.
   One lobbyist, a former congressional agriculture aide, estimated
that there are more than 200 people like him working on various
aspects of the farm bill.
   ``It's a whole community, it's what they do,'' he said.
   Throughout consideration of the bill, a flock of farm lobbyists
stood vigil around the rooms and corridors off the House and Senate
chambers, glancing up each time someone moved toward the chamber.
   There were the usual representatives of commodity groups and
organizations such as the American Agriculture Movement.
   But among the farm corps, some with cowboy boots protruding from
under their suit pants, were unlikely allies _ the labor and
environmental lobbies.
   They started watching agriculture after passage of the 1985 farm
bill. That measure contained landmark conservation provisions and a
section that used overseas sales of surplus grain to subsidize the
U.S. merchant marine.
   It was a coalition Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., couldn't defeat
when he tried to eliminate subsidies from the wealthiest farmers in
the House version of the bill.
   ``We never had enough support on the outside,'' Schumer lamented
after his amendment failed 263-159. The farm lobby ``was out there
in force, and they were united.''
   He said the members of the Agriculture Committee pour all their
efforts into this one bill every five years, making friendships and
doing favors for colleagues to ensure its passage.
   ``This is the most important issue to 40 or 50 members of
Congress. And that's hard to beat,'' he said.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who tried unsuccessfully to cut back
subsidies in the sugar program, said ``Some of the better labor
lobbyists were watching the farm bill closely.''
   ``Bartering 40 or 50 solid votes is a very powerful coalition,''
he said of the agriculture bloc. ``I was astonished by the number
of votes that beat us'' on the sugar amendment. ``They play
hardball.''
   House Agriculture Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
acknowledged the some of the unlikely bedfellows that were joining
the farm lobby. ``You take help wherever you can get it,'' he said.
   ``If you drive farmers out of the program, you take acres out of
the program that you will not be able to keep environmentally
sound,'' he said of the environmentalists' interests in keeping
even the wealthiest farmers on government subsidies.
   As for organized labor: ``I think their interest is jobs. Like I
tell my friends in the UAW in Detroit: no farmer, no pickup.''

<HEAD>Testimony Raises New Questions About Bush's Iran-Contra Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Testimony in a federal civil trial here has raised
new questions about then-Vice President Bush's knowledge of the
illegal Contra supply network run by Oliver North.
   Bush has repeatedly denied being informed of air drops of
supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1986 at a time Congress had
barred lethal aid.
   But Richard Gadd, a retired Air Force colonel who helped set up
the network for North and and retired Air Force Gen. Richard
Secord, said in a deposition that he was told that the vice
president was briefed on the operation at the time.
   A federal grand jury has been meeting in Washington to continue
the investigation into the Iran-Contra affair and is reportedly
considering the roles of Bush and former President Reagan.
   Gadd's sworn deposition was read Friday during trial on a damage
suit filed against Secord by Contra supply plane crewman Eugene
Hasenfus, the sole survivor from a C-123 shot down over Nicaragua
in October 1986. The crash and Hasenfus' capture helped unravel the
Iran-Contra affair.
   In Gadd's deposition, Hasenfus' lawyer asked if former CIA agent
Felix Rodriguez, who helped oversee the base in El Salvador where
many Contra supply flights originated, had ever voiced complaints
about shoddy equipment. Rodriguez worked closely with Robert
Dutton, supervisor of Secord's Contra supply network.
   The deposition _ sworn testimony taken outside of open court _
continues:
   Gadd: ``I can recall one conversation that Mr. Dutton related to
me that Mr. Felix Rodriguez discussing (sic) those kinds of issues
with the Vice President.''
   Attorney: ``Did Mr. Dutton say that Rodriguez was discussing
those issues with Vice President Bush?''
   Gadd: ``Yes, he told me that.''
   Attorney: ``Did he tell you where he got that information?''
   Gadd: ``I don't recall.''
   Outside the courtroom, Rodriguez, who also testified Friday in
the case but did not say what he told Bush, strongly denied
discussing Contra aid with the vice president. He said two meetings
they had in 1986 dealt only with Rodriguez's legitimate mission
helping the El Salvador air force hunt leftist guerrillas.
   He said he deliberately avoided discussing the Contra operation
with Bush because he wanted to avoid another Watergate-type scandal.
   Spokesmen for the president did not immediately respond to the
deposition, but in the past Bush has energetically denied his
meetings with Rodriguez covered the illegal Contra supply network.
   ``There was no discussion, direct or indirect, on the Contra aid
network,'' the president has said previously.
   Questions about that account were first raised in 1987 when a
memo by Bush's national security aide, Col. Samuel J. Watson, was
released by the Iran-Contra investigating committee.
   The memo, dated April 30, 1986, mentioned a meeting planned for
the following day between Rodriguez and Bush.
   ``Felix Rodriguez, a counterinsurgency expert who is visiting
from El Salvador, will provide a briefing on the status of the war
in El Salvador and resupply of the Contras,'' the memo said.
   Bush aides later testified the memo was simply mistaken.
   In May, copies of North's diary were released by a private
watchdog group showing that North met with Bush only hours after
lying to a congressional panel by denying that any U.S. officials
were helping the Contras. At the time, Aug. 6, 1986, federal aid to
the Contras had been cut off.
   Both Gadd and Dutton, also a retired Air Force colonel,
testified for the prosecution at North's 1989 trial, and they also
testified under grants of immunity at the Iran-Contra hearings.
   Efforts to locate Gadd over the weekend were not successful.
There is no telephone listing under his name in the area of
Washington, D.C., where the deposition was taken.

   A French trawler sank Sunday in the
English Channel, and the coast guard said three people died.
Officials said two people were rescued.
   The names of those on board the trawler Ar-Roak, based in
Dieppe, France, were not immediately available.
   Rescuers continued searching the channel for a possible sixth
person aboard the trawler, which went down about 30 miles off the
Sussex coast, said a spokesman with the British coast guard, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Divers recovered two bodies from inside the vessel and a rescue
helicopter picked up the two survivors, one of whom was flown to a
hospital in Brighton where he was listed in serious condition,
officials said. The condition of the second survivor was not known.
   Two bodies were flown by helicopter to the Haslar Royal Navy
Hospital in Gosport where they were pronounced dead. The third body
was picked up by lifeboat and taken to Newhaven.
   Officials speculated that the trawlers' nets may have snared on
a submerged wreck and caused the boat to keel over.
   The rescue operation involved other fishing vessels as well as
lifeboats, helicopters, divers and coast guard vessels, officials
said.

<TEXT>
   The world's most powerful agriculture officials
prepared Sunday to tackle some of the thorniest disputes in world
trade _ farm issues.
   Top agriculture officials from the United States, Japan, Canada
and Australia were to open a two-day meeting in Ireland on Monday
with the European Community's agriculture minister.
   The European Community said the five farm officials will assess
developments since the Group of Seven summit in Houston earlier
this month, where the industrial world's leaders gave impetus to
efforts to end farm supports.
   ``The meeting is an occasion for certain major players to
exchange views. That is extremely useful,'' an EC official, who
spoke on conditon of anonymity, said Friday.
   Through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 105
nations are negotiating for more liberalized world trade, which
could bring added growth and prosperity to the world's economies.
   There are doubts that an overall agreement can be reached by the
end of GATT talks in December.
   The GATT talks cover 15 areas of trade _ including intellectual
property rights, textiles, trade-related investment and trade in
services _ but the principal disagreements center on agriculture.
   The United States and 14 other farm-exporting countries want the
12-nation EC to end its export credits system and cut direct
subsidies for farmers, which the critics say distort trade.
   The developed world's farm subsidies cost consumers and
taxpayers $245 billion last year, according to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It said the
EC's cost was $93 billion, Japan's $68 billion and the United
States' $46 billion.
   The EC agriculture minister, Ray MacSharry of Ireland, called
this week's meeting, to be held at Dromoland Castle near Shannon in
western Ireland.
   Attending are Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Japanese
Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto, Australian Agriculture
Minister John Kerins and Canadian Agriculture Minister Donald
Mazankowski.
   Domestic agricultural policies, international agricultural
trade, rural development and Eastern Europe are on the agenda, the
EC said.
   The communique issued at the Houston summit left it to GATT
negotatiators to decide how much to cut subsidies, but suggested
that trade negotiators use as a basis a compromise proposal written
by the chairman of GATT's agricultural negotiating committee,
Dutchman Aart de Zeeuw.
   The paper called for quick cuts of export subsidies as part of
lowering farm support levels.
   The farm subsidies were the toughest issue negotiated at the
Houston summit, attending by the leaders of the United States,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, as well as the
EC.
   The summit's communique called for ``substantial, progressive
reductions in support and protection of agriculture _ covering
internal regimes, market access and export subsidies.''
   But it also conceded the EC point that ``variations among
countries in the mechanisms of agricultural support reflect the
differences in the social and economic conditions of farming.''

<HEAD>Winter Haute Couture is Short, Scintillating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This winter's tale of haute couture as seen last
week was a fabulous fantasy, with designers spinning out their
dreams in rich confections for the elite, or just for show.
   Short to shorter is the norm in daytime lengths, though houses
like Saint Laurent and Givenchy generally kept skirts wearably just
above the knee.
   And was enough gold and jeweled embroidery around to boost many
prices into the stratosphere.
   But dream on ... and take note of silhouettes, fabrics and
color, often more modestly available in ready-to-wear. There is a
rainbow of possibilities, with each designer pushing his own
outlines and themes.
   The fashion world was pleased to see Claude Montana win the
coveted Golden Thimble award for his Lanvin collection, following
his disappointing debut there last January.
   His pyramid shortie coats and babydoll jackets, his lean pants
or skirt suits, his great use of luxury fabrics from cashmere to
faille taffeta showed Montana's mastery of his art, so often
praised before in his own luxury ready-to-wear line.
   The pyramid shape or other shortie-coat looks cropped up all
over the place. Saint Laurent's more sober versions have deep, full
dolmen sleeves.
   Shoulders are mainly rounded, even sloped. The only hold-outs
for important padding are Saint Laurent and Givenchy.
   Suits are body-skimming but not so tight as a few seasons ago,
with great long jackets and some nice flyaway boleros.
   Generally the daytime fabrics were smooth, light and soft in
cashmeres or broadcloth or tweedy, with flecked or herringbones,
some bold black and red plaids _ great at Valentino, for example.
Python is a new favorite for trim at Givenchy, for a whole jacket
or more at Saint Laurent.
   Daytime colors included fall stand-bys _ siena, gray, burnt
orange, ochre, pine and brick, plus some white and all the browns
from caramel to chocolate. Dior's Gianfranco Ferre did
extraordinary things with mixes of blue shades from plum to
ultramarine or indigo.
   In both daytime and late-day wear, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
pleased those who would like to look young and kittenish with minis
over fancy thigh boots _ from hot satin to jeweled or embroidered
suede.
   Lagerfeld's boots were among the most flamboyant in a
newly-revived trend for long, lean and high or flat-heeled boots.
   He seems torn between the 1960s ingenue look and the l8th
century of Marie-Antoinette, topping dressy, skimpy minis with big
satin and taffeta embroidered pannier skirts.
   Exotic lands and themes inspired many designers. Jean-Louis
Scherrer was praised for a collection based on the splendors of
North Africa and the Near East in Persian-rug weaves for his suits
and colorful hooded burnoose-style coats.
   Except for a wild jeweled bathing suit with tights, Christian
Lacroix kept his exuberance in check, though there was plenty of
glamor in evening dresses inspired by Goya, or contemporary gold
lame suits topped with enormous velvet artists' berets, as well as
some extravagant Moorish-style embroidery.
   Everything came up roses at Ungaro, who used magnificent flower
prints from dawn to dark. His bright piped tweed daytime suits in
grey, red or royal blue with their checked stoles were stunning too.
   It was in evening wear, however, that Ungaro and other
couturiers turned into real showmen. His extravagant, rosy silk
panniered dresses might not be to everybody's taste. But he offered
an alternative: glamorous black slinky crepe or chiffon gowns with
halter necklines, camisole or scooped-out tops draped in
rhinestones or pearls.
   For evening, anything goes as long as it looks rich. And
decolletes are more daring than ever, with bosoms pushed up under
empire curved bodices, visible in sparkly net or chiffon
see-throughs, or suggestive with necklines slashed to the waist.
   Feathers came out often _ ostriches, pheasant, cock and other
types were used. Scherrer's spicy asymmetrical draped and feathered
minis were especially titillating.

<TEXT>
   Most of Alaska is the sort of country
smokejumpers were born for _ vast tracts of roadless wilderness
accessible only by air.
   But in this extremely dry summer, many fires are too big for the
crack parachute firefighters, whose purpose is to prevent small
fires from growing. And the men are grounded for days by
unfavorable weather.
   Sunday's weather was slightly improved with lower temperatures
and showers scattered across the state, meaning fires weren't
growing nearly as fast as they did last week, said Trish
Hogervorst-Rukke of the Interagency Fire Coordination Center in
Fairbanks.
   Dozens of fires burned hundreds of thousands of acres of
unpopulated land Saturday near the central Alaska city of McGrath,
about 225 miles northwest of Anchorage.
   Nobody was fighting them.
   ``They're a little bored. We haven't jumped a fire in two
days,'' said Allen Biller, 34, of Fairbanks, leader of a
smokejumper unit that was killing time at the McGrath airport.
Nobody smoked _ the air just smells that way here these days.
   ``We were pulled off a fire two days ago because the winds
kicked up and it got away from us,'' he said. ``There was no use in
staying because we couldn't catch it.''
   As of Sunday morning, 2,176,501 acres of Alaskan timber and
tundra had been burned since the fire season began this month, an
area more than three times the size of Rhode Island, and 119 fires
were still active, Hogervorst said. More than 5 million acres
burned in 1957; in 1969, more than 4 million acres burned.
   The state's largest fire had burned 210,000 acres at Kanuti, 140
miles northwest of Fairbanks.
   Smokejumpers, the top firefighting units of the Bureau of Land
Management and the Forest Service, usually can keep nine of 10
Alaska blazes they attack from spreading, they say.
   Not so this year.
   ``I've been on a lot of fires this year in Alaska and I think
we've only caught one,'' said Roger Staats, 26, of McCall, Idaho.
``It's hard on guys' morale.''
   Smokejumpers need a good head start on a fire, catching it when
it's still small. This summer, smoke from other fires has obscured
the flames, giving the small ones time to grow undetected.
   Biller, whose job is to spot fires from the plane to see if
smokejumpers should jump, said he has bypassed more sites than
usual this summer because the fires were already too big for the
small number of people on hand.
   And while fire retardant usually is dropped from planes to help
smokejumpers, this summer the vegetation is so dry the retardant
isn't working, officials said.
   Alaska is having one of its most arid seasons on record,
according to the National Weather Service. Since June 21, McGrath
has had about 1 inch of rain, compared with an average 1.8 inches.
   Last week, Biller's unit of eight smokejumpers parachuted to a
three-acre fire southwest of McGrath. They worked on it from noon
all the way to 5 p.m. the next day but couldn't prevent it from
racing to 500 acres. The smokejumpers pulled out and have been in
McGrath waiting ever since.
   The vast majority of fires _ those that aren't near villages or
cabins _ are just being left to burn out.
   Even so, there were about 2,700 people working 19 fires in
Alaska, only a fraction of them smokejumpers, officials said.
   ``We're just bare bones with people resources,'' said Andy
Alexandrou, a state forester in McGrath. ``We've been bouncing
people around from fire to fire trying to keep pace with it.''
   Firefighters in Alaska face problems not often encountered in
the Lower 48 states. In addition to forests, they must fight blazes
on the treeless tundra, a mat of arctic-region vegetation that
usually sops up water like a sponge. This summer, firefighters say,
even the bottom of the sponge is dry.
   A fire doused on the surface can leave embers that burn through
the lower layer and erupt to the surface elsewhere.
   ``Down south a fire usually creeps along the ground from tree to
tree, but once you get a line around it you can mop it up,'' said
Staats. ``Here, you soak it and soak it and you turn around and
it's burning all over again.''
   And heavy equipment like bulldozers can't be used against fires
here, partly because the tundra is too fragile but mainly because
usually there isn't a road within hundreds of miles.
   Beneath the tundra is permafrost. ``Down south you could scrape
a fire line with your boots _ there's dirt,'' said Alexandrou.
``Here you'd break your boot.''

   Nepal has abolished the death sentence,
saying Sunday that the punishment was considered inconsistent with
the new multiparty system of government.
   Two laws enacted by the previous government have been repealed,
removing capital punishment for murder, involvement in murder or
subversive activities, said a Law and Justice Ministry spokeman.
The spokesman cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The two laws were enacted in 1985 by the partyless Panchayat
system of government that was dismantled by King Birendra in April
after a massive pro-democracy movement.
   Sunday's announcement was the latest in a series of decisions by
Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai's administration toward
distancing itself from the previous government's policies.
   Bhattarai took over as the head of an interim government April
19 after Birendra loosened his hold over power and lifted a 29-year
ban on political parties.
   National elections are scheduled to be held in April.

<HEAD>Opposition Demands Release of Leader, Convening of Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition party that won elections
two months ago called Sunday for the new Parliament to convene in
September and demanded the release of its leaders held by the
military government.
   The National League For Democracy, wrapping up a two-day
conference, also called for talks with Burma's military rulers, who
have so far refused to turn over power.
   In addition, the opposition demanded democratic rights including
freedom of the press and freedom of expression during the
transition to civilian rule.
   There was no immediate reaction from the government.
   The League won a landslide victory in May 27 parliamentary
elections. The government said last month that the
opposition-dominated parliament could be convened after election
expenses and candidates' objections to the poll results have been
settled. But it gave no timetable for convening the body.
   On Friday, the government set new conditions that would in
effect indefinitely postpone the transition to civilian rule.
   Outside the hall where about 500 members of the League held
their gathering, about 30 youths outside shouted demands for the
release of the party leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. They then dispersed
peacefully, witnesses said.
   Throughout the conference, the hall was cordoned off by police
and troops were armed with automatic rifles.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since July 20, 1989. The
government accused her of subversion but filed no formal charges.
   Authorities have not said why they were still holding her,
although the initial one-year sentence has passed.
   ``We hereby demand the calling of a parliamentary session in
September, dialogue between the (military government) and the
(League) and the release of detained leaders including Aung San Suu
Kyi,'' said the resolution approved by the conference.
   Party leaders also reported the drafting of a provisional
constitution to allow a transfer of power to the elected
parliament. They said a national convention should be held later to
draft and adopt a permanent national constitution.
   The League won 396 seats in the 485-member parliament elected in
the May elections, the first free vote in 30 years. Attending the
weekend conference were 379 of the party's members elected to
parliament.
   The government said Friday it would convene its own national
conference to provide guidelines for drafting the constitution, and
that the constitution would be adopted after a referendum _ and
only then would it turn over power. No timetable was given for
these actions.
   The spokesman, Kyaw Sann, warned that the authorities would
``take action against any attempt to adopt any interim constitution
and government.''
   The military government of Gen. Saw Maung took over in September
1988 by crushing a national pro-democracy uprising and killing
hundreds of demonstrators. It has ruled by martial law since.
   There have been some anti-government demonstrations in recent
weeks, with youths rallying in small groups in Rangoon and the
major central city of Mandalay.
   They demanded an early transfer of power and the release of Ms.
Suu Kyi.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday urged
impatient Soviet republics not to print their own money, saying it
would damage efforts to reform the banking and credit system.
   Gorbachev made the appeal in a directive setting in motion an
analysis of the country's banking system by officials from both the
15 Soviet republics and Moscow.
   Gorbachev, in an appeal transmitted by the Tass news agency,
said he wanted the republics to understand the ``negative
social-economic consequences that could result from breaking the
united monetary system of the country, releasing money of the
republic that would have closed sphere of circulation.''
   ``To correct the finances of the country the strength of all
union republics and the carrying out of active, coordinated money
and financial-budget policy is necessary,'' he said.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all
working on plans to print their own money as they press for
complete independence from the Soviet Union. Earlier this month,
the Ukraine included plans for a separate currency in its
declaration of sovereignty.
   The chairman of the European Community, which is looking for
ways to help the Soviet economy, said on a visit to Moscow on July
20 that it would be a ``devastating'' blow to Soviet efforts to
integrate into the world economy if republics started printing
their own money.
   ``To complete the building of a European Community we decided to
have a single financial system and a single currency,'' Jacques
Delors said.
   ``That is why we said we were surprised on hearing that the
Ukraine and other republics want to introduce their own
currencies,'' Delors said. ``I think that at this stage of economic
reforms, that step would have devastating consequences.''
   On Saturday, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the
Soviet Union is ready to join the International Monetary Fund.
   ``Our country regards its membership in the IMF as a logical
continuation of its policy of wider involvement in global economic
cooperation,'' Tass quoted Shevardnadze as telling Michel
Camdessus, the managing director of the fund.
   Camdessus responded positively to the proposal, Tass said.

<HEAD>Andean Leaders Seek Crop-Substitution Help to Fight Coca
Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heads of the world's main
cocaine-producing countries said Sunday they welcomed U.S.
anti-drug efforts, but said poor Andean peasants who grow the coca
leaf need another way to make a living.
   Members of the Andean Presidential Council issued a joint
declaration saying the fight against drugs was not only a law
enforcement problem, but one with political, economic and social
dimensions.
   The presidents _ Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia, Alberto Fujimori of Peru, Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela, Patricio Aylwin of Chile and Carlos Menem of Argentina _
met privately late Saturday in Lima, only hours after Fujimori's
inauguration.
   Ecuador was represented by its vice president, Luis Parodi,
Peru's presidential office said.
   At his swearing-in ceremony on Saturday, Fujimori said Peru will
combat drug trafficking. But he said it is not fair or realistic to
expect Peruvian peasants to simply stop growing coca leaf _ from
which cocaine is made _ without some other livelihood to turn to.
   The Andean presidents said crop-substitution efforts were a top
priority.
   They reiterated overall support for a U.S. anti-drug plan _
announced by President Bush in Cartagena, Colombia in February _
involving Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. But they said the United
States also must provide financial help to the poor Latin nations
trying to stop drug production.
   The Bush administration has proposed a $2 billion-plus program
of military, economic, police and Drug Enforcement Administration
aid to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru through 1994.
   Latin countries, however, have been wary about allowing direct
U.S. anti-drug operations in their countries, often on the grounds
that in doing so would represent a loss of sovreignty.
   The Andean presidents called Bush's proposals ``a first step.''
   Latin American leaders, most notably Colombia's Barco, have said
repeatedly that drug-consuming nations such as the United States
are just as responsible for the cocaine problem as are the South
American countries that produce the drug.
   ``You cannot place the weight of responsibility for this fight
on a poor country buried in a severe economic crisis,'' Fujimori
said in his inaugural address.
   The Andean Presidential Council set another meeting for Aug. 7
in Bogota, Colombia. They expect to be in the Colombian capital
then for the inauguration of that country's new president, Cesar
Gaviria.

   She was a Playboy club waitress turned
policewoman, then a fired officer convicted of killing her
husband's ex-wife in a trial that left many doubting her guilt.
   Now 31-year-old Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek has captured the
public's taste for the lurid again _ this time by escaping from
prison and apparently fleeing with her fiance, Dominick Gugliatto.
   The couple disappeared July 15, just three weeks before their
scheduled prison wedding, touching off a fugitive love story that
has caught the public's fancy and left many cheering her escape.
   ``There's something about her history that appeals to the voyeur
in everyone,'' said sociologist Eleanor Miller.
   The renewed interest in the case has prompted entrepreneurs to
sell ``Run Bambi Run'' T-shirts and bumper stickers and cardboard
cutouts of the former model.
   It also has left hundreds calling for a new trial for her,
creating a circuslike atmosphere in her native Milwaukee.
   Ms. Bembenek, once a waitress at the now-defunct Playboy club in
Lake Geneva, became a police officer in Milwaukee in the late
1970s. She was fired from the department in 1980 for lying and the
next year was arrested in the shooting death of Christine Schultz.
   Mrs. Schultz was the ex-wife of Ms. Bembenek's then-husband,
police detective Elfred Schultz. She was found by her two young
sons in her bed. She had been bound, gagged and shot in the back,
apparently by Schultz's gun.
   Police speculated Ms. Bembenek took her husband's revolver and
shot Mrs. Schultz over the $700-a-month in alimony that Schultz had
been ordered to pay his ex-wife.
   A jury convicted Ms. Bembenek of first-degree murder despite
testimony from one of the victim's sons that the person seen in the
house the night of the killing was not Ms. Bembenek.
   Prosecutors, while rejecting calls for a new trial, have
conceded their case against Ms. Bembenek was based on
circumstantial evidence.
   When Ms. Bembenek escaped, she was serving a life term but would
have been eligible for parole in 1993. Her efforts to win a new
trial have been rejected by state appeals courts three times and
the state Supreme Court once.
   Even nine years later, many remain convinced she was innocent _
the victim of circumstantial evidence and poor police work. More
than 200 people showed up for a ``Run Bambi Run'' rally Friday
outside the courthouse where she was convicted.
   They gave impassioned speeches calling for a new trial, raised
money for a legal defense fund, sold Bembenek memorabilia and even
wished her good luck in avoiding capture.
   Police believe Ms. Bembenek fled with Gugliatto, a 34-year-old
Milwaukee factory worker whom she planned to marry Aug. 3 in a
prison chapel wedding. Prison officials say she squeezed out of a
laundry-room window and scaled a 7-foot high fenced laced with
barbed wire.
   Gugliatto's parents and his sisters were among those gathered at
the rally last week. Florence Gugliatto, his mother, said the
family believed the two were together, although they had not heard
from the couple.
   Even before the escape, Ms. Bembenek's case got plenty of
attention.
   A private investigator volunteered to painstakingly review all
evidence in the case in hopes of finding a compelling argument to
overturn her conviction. A suitor donated $30,000 for her legal
expenses. And a congressman asked the FBI to review the evidence.
   So why such a fascination for a woman branded by the justice
system as a killer?
   Ms. Bembenek is ``very beautiful and can look very beautiful in
a variety of ways'' and that has added to her mystique, explained
Ms. Miller, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
   ``The sense is somehow the criminal justice system is the bad
guy and she is the good guy,'' she said.
   Another sociologist claims Ms. Bembenek fits the role of the
``femme fatale,'' the alluring but dangerous woman fancied in novel
and movies.
   ``No one knows exactly who she is,'' said Richard Knudten of
Marquette University in Milwaukee. ``Either she is very clever or
else she fully believes in her innocence. It's much more
titillating and much more exciting than most homicides, by far.''

<HEAD>Algeria Announces Early Elections, Meeting Fundamentalist Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RACHID KHIARI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid said Sunday
that he would move up parliamentary elections, making a major
concession to Moslem fundamentalists who swept June's local
elections.
   Bendjedid said the decision to dissolve the National People's
Assembly and hold early elections in the first four months of 1991
was made ``after lengthy reflection and my conviction that the
political parties will respect the rules of democracy.''
   Elections had been scheduled for February 1992.
   The decision came days after Islamic Salvation Front leader
Abassi Madani made his latest call for the immediate dissolution of
the Assembly.
   The Islamic Salvation Front won a wide victory in the June 12
municipal and provincial elections, the first multiparty voting
since Algeria gained independence from France in 1962. Since then,
Madani says, the parliament ``represents nothing.''
   The ruling National Liberation Front holds all 295 seats in the
Assembly. The party trailed second in the June balloting, which was
boycotted by many opposition parties.
   Bendjedid said the elections would only take place if conditions
for ``peace and security'' are met. He did not elaborate.
   ``We are thus giving the people the occasion to choose freely
their representatives,'' said Bendjedid at a special Cabinet
session installing the nation's first defense minister, Gen. Khaled
Nezzar.
   He added that his decision ``in no way signifies that the actual
Assembly has failed in its mission.''
   The Front has ruled Algeria for nearly 30 years but is in the
midst of a broad restructuring following its June defeat in local
elections.
   A new constitution allowing pluralism was approved in a February
1989 referendum. The changes were made following the 1988 riots,
spurred by an economic crisis, in which hundreds of people were
killed.
   Since the June elections, the Islamic Salvation Front has moved
to introduce programs based on Islamic law in the localities it
controls.
   Algerian radio announced earlier Sunday that wearing shorts has
been made illegal in the vacation town of Jijel, in eastern Algeria.
   A decree forbidding shorts in Tipaza, a tourist resort 50 miles
west of Algiers, had been issued earlier. The Islamic Salvation
Front controls both towns.
   Islamic fundamentalists consider wearing shorts to be immodest.

<HEAD>Referendum Calling for Popular Vote Apparently Defeated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A referendum on Sunday calling for
popular presidential elections was headed for defeat because voter
turnout was too low, media reports said.
   Under current law, legislators pick the president. Switching
over to a popular vote would have required the backing of 50
percent of Hungary's 7.8 million voters.
   Hungarian television said only 15 percent turned out, far short
of the number needed.
   Scorching weather and the holiday season were blamed in part for
the low turnout. Sunday was the hottest day in Hungary this year,
with 90-degree temperatures.
   Of those who did take part, 88 percent voted in favor of a
direct presidential vote, while 12 percent voted for presidential
elections by lawmakers.
   Parliament is currently dominated by the conservative Democratic
Forum and other center-right parties.
   If the failure of the referendum is officially confirmed, it
would be a blow to the the Socialists _ the former Communists _ who
were defeated in this spring's first free multiparty elections in
more than 40 years.
   The Socialists wanted a direct presidential vote, because former
Premier Miklos Nemeth still enjoys considerable popularity, and
they believed he might have had a chance to be elected president in
a popular vote.
   At least one parliamentary faction, the Smallholders Party, had
called for a boycott of the referendum. It said the country needs
economic improvement, not a referendum or presidential election.
   Others criticized the election date, in the middle of the
summer-vacation season, and criticized the referendum's $6.6
million cost.
   An agreement signed last September by the government and
opposition state that Hungary called for revival of the
parliamentary system that existed before the Communist takeover,
after World War II.
   Some politicians, though, contended the parliamentary system was
fragile and the country needed an independent presidency.
   A constitutional amendment passed in the final days of the
previous Communist-dominated Parliament stipulated that the
president must be elected directly.
   In April, the biggest party in Parliament, the Hungarian
Democratic Forum, and the biggest opposition party, the League of
Free Democrats, signed an agreement calling for the constitution to
be amended yet again and the president elected by parliament.
   In response, the Socialists launched a petition drive and
succeeded in calling a referendum on the subject.

   Here are some facts and figures on Trinidad and Tobago:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ The island of Trinidad is in the Caribbean about
eight miles off northeast Venezuela. The smaller island of Tobago
lies about 20 miles farther to the northeast. Together, they cover
1,978 square miles, about 1{ times the size of Rhode Island. The
capital is Port-of-Spain. The terrain consists of plains and low
mountains. The climate is tropical.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The nation has a cosmopolitan population of about
1.3 million, all but 45,000 residing on Trinidad. Most of the
people are of African or East Indian origin. Trinidadians of mixed
race make up slightly more than 16 percent. Whites comprise 1.7
percent. The two major folk traditions are Creole, a mixture of
African elements influenced by Spanish, French and English culture,
and East Indian. About 33 percent are Roman Catholics, 24.5 percent
Hindus, 15 percent Anglicans and about 6 percent Moslems. The
language is English.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Trinidad and Tobago's exports consist mainly of
petroleum and petroleum products, fertilizers, chemicals, sugar and
cocoa. It has a small tourism industry, with a famous reef for
divers off Tobago and a carnival in Port-of-Spain. The territory is
largely dependent on imported food.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Columbus discovered Trinidad on his third voyage to
the New World in 1498. Spain made the first successful attempt to
colonize the island in 1592 and Spanish rule continued until
Trinidad was captured by the British in 1797. Abolition of slavery
throughout the British Empire in 1833 led to a wave of immigration
from India that went on until 1915. Trinidad and Tobago were merged
in 1888. After a brief spell of being part of an autonomous
Federation of the West Indies with Jamaica, Barbados, and the
Leeward and Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago became
independent and joined the Commonwealth in 1962.
   The nation has a bicameral legislature of Senate and House of
Representatives. The Cabinet consists of the prime minister,
appointed by the president, and other ministers.

<HEAD>Armenia Defying Gorbachev on Decree to Disarm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenian lawmakers have voted to defy President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decree that armed groups must turn in their
weapons and disband, a local activist said Sunday.
   Lawmakers on Saturday gave preliminary approval to a resolution
that would suspend Gorbachev's decree on Armenian territory, as
well as in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, according to a
spokesman for the Armenian National Movement.
   The measure will be discussed further at the legislative session
Monday, said the spokesman in a telephone interview from Armenia's
capital of Yerevan.
   The spokesman, who declined to give his name, said the lawmakers
believe the presidential decree contradicts the Armenian
constitution.
   Gorbachev issued a decree Wednesday giving illegally armed
militants across the country 15 days to turn in their weapons or
risk having them confiscated by local police, officials of the
republics or Interior Ministry troops.
   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin said Friday that if
armed groups disobeyed the order, military force would be used. He
referred specifically to armed groups in Armenia.
   He estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 Armenians were
involved in illegally armed groups, but said others put the figure
at 40,000 and as high as 100,000.
   Bakatin acknowledged there could be problems implementing
Gorbachev's decree if Moscow does not have the full cooperation of
the republics.
   The Interfax news agency, affiliated with Radio Moscow, reported
that many Armenian lawmakers sharply oppose the decree, and some
wanted to form an independent Armenian army during the 15 days.
   Gorbachev's decree encompassed all groups that threatened
people's lives, seized arms, assaulted soldiers or police, or
attacked military and civilian facilities.
   Besides Armenia, Bakatin said illegally armed groups also
operate in Moldavia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia.
   Bakatin said Interior Ministry troops would be sent to republics
requesting them, and army troops could go in if a state of
emergency were declared. He said many local officials are swept up
in the same nationalism as their neighbors and are powerless to
stop ethnic fighting.
   In Armenia, troops have seized 6,000 firearms, including 1,500
automatic weapons, Bakatin said.
   Interior Ministry soldiers already patrol the border between
Azerbaijan and Armenia. At least 200 more have been killed, and
many thousands have been forced to flee their homes in violence
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the past two years.
   Much of the bloodshed has been over who should govern the region
of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave controled by
Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Meanwhile, in the republic of Georgia, hundreds of protesters
demanding immediate registration of political groups for multiparty
elections were blocking trains at a railroad hub.
   The protest, which began Thursday, has stranded 30 passenger
trains and 90 freight trains laden with wheat, oil, sugar, meat and
gasoline at the Samtredia railway junction of the trans-Caucasian
railroad, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   The junction is about 125 miles northwest of Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital.
   The protesters _ numbering about 700, according to the
unofficial Postfactum news service _ are demanding the Georgian
parliament convene immediately to adopt a law to register groups
for Oct. 28 elections.
   Parliament is not scheduled to meet until Aug. 17.
   Georgian Communist Party leader Givi Gumbaridze, quoted by
Pravda, warned the protest could lead to ``confrontation of force.''

   Malcom Muggeridge, one of Britain's most
celebrated media pundits, was listed Sunday in ``stable condition''
after suffering a stroke, according to hospital officials.
   The 87-year-old journalist, author and television personality
was admitted Friday to St. Helen's Hospital in Hastings, 32 miles
east of Brighton.
   Since January 1937, when he was asked by the British
Broadcasting Corp. to read his own short story on the air,
Muggeridge's iconoclastic, anti-Establishment journalism has been
read and listened to throughout the world in newspapers, magazines,
books, published diaries and on TV.
   He converted to Roman Catholicism when he was 80 and, after a
life of globe trotting, has spent the last decade in a 400-year-old
Sussex cottage with his wife of 60 years, Kitty.
   ``I have always looked forward to death. ... It would be a
terrible prospect, wouldn't it, to just go on and on and on.
Everything is bearable because we die,'' Muggeridge said in a 1981
interview with The Times.
   ``I take Pascal's wager. If you have to bet on there being a
heaven or not, you should presume there is, because otherwise, if
you lost, you would never know.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 6,000 people crowded into this small
south-central Oregon town for a tongue-in-cheek celebration of an
insect whose bite and whining buzz drive people up the wall.
   The seventh annual Mosquito Festival featured giant replicas of
the insect and the coronation of a Ms. Quito, 45-year-old Joanne
Solheim.
   The festival was started in 1983 as a way to raise money to
combat swarms of hungry mosquitoes that flew into the town of 365
residents from irrigated fields on nearby ranches and from adjacent
swamps.
   A woman named Beverly Hills, co-chairwoman of the event, said
Saturday's festival was ``the biggest and best we have had in seven
years and, if you'll notice, there weren't any mosquitoes. That
means our program is working.''
   Organizers said the festival usually raises about $20,000, with
approximately $11,000 left over for mosquito control after expenses
are paid.
   The money buys biologically safe insecticide that is sprayed in
town to knock down adult mosquitoes and attack mosquito larvae in
the ponds and puddles where they breed.
   The parade was indicative of the town's laid-back style. There
were several gaps between entries, with some float drivers stopping
occasionally to talk with friends along the route.
   Before mosquito eradication efforts began in ernest, 17
varieties of the little pests were identified around Paisley.

   Princess Diana was among 60,000 cheering fans who
attended one of Tina Turner's last live shows, held in the open-air
theater at the stately Woburn Abbey outside London.
   The rock and soul singer is on what she says is her final
concert tour before concentrating on films. Her acting career
includes roles in ``Tommy'' and ``Mad Max III: Beyond Thunderdome.''
   Ms. Turner's press agent, Bernard Docherty, said she is
negotiating with several film producers and was particularly
interested on playing in a science fiction movie after her tour
ends in six weeks.
   She also will try her hand at producing records and videos, he
said.
   The 51-year-old singer entertained an audience Saturday night
that included singers Elton John, Mark Knopfler and Kate Bush, in
addition to the princess who stayed for the entire two-hour show.
   Prince Charles, who is recovering from a broken arm, did not
accompany his wife to the concert Saturday. On Sunday, the couple
celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary out of the limelight
because of his injured arm.

   President Bush went boating in the
early morning fog, attended church and hit the tennis courts Sunday
while monitoring the progress of a coup attempt in Trinidad.
   Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, were
kept abreast of developments in the Trinidadian capital of
Port-of-Spain, where rebels were holding Prime Minister Arthur
Robinson and several ministers hostage.
   Bush took his speedboat Fidelity out for an early morning spin
in the Atlantic while fog still blanketed the rugged coastline
around Walker's Point.
   Photographers in a chase boat lost track of the president, and
overheard on marine radio a call to local Kennebunkport fire
authorities for a rescue boat. That gave rise to rumors that Bush
might have lost his way in the fog.
   But a presidential spokeswoman said later that was not the case.
   ``The president's boat was fine. There was some `Rescue 1'
request that was heard ... but that was completely unrelated to the
president,'' deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said.
   ``There's always a Coast Guard boat with him, and they have the
best radar systems one can have,'' she said.
   She denied that the Coast Guard had to show Bush the way back to
Walker's Point.
   ``I cannot tell you whether there was any fish caught.
Regardless, the president's boat was always in control,'' she added.
   After hitting the local golf course Friday as soon as he arrived
in Maine, Bush managed to skip golf the rest of this sunny weekend.
He often golfs daily here, even in the rain.
   Bush attended the wedding of a cousin's son on Saturday at St.
Ann's Episcopal Church, the same stone church where the Bushes
attended services Sunday.
   Bush was returning to Washington on Sunday without wife Barbara,
who planned to spend the entire month of August here with Bush
children and grandchildren. The president was to return here Aug.
10 and stay until Labor Day.
   Bush will resume deficit reductions talks with leaders of
Congress this week. On Thursday he flies to Aspen, Colo., to
address the Aspen Institute and meet with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. The institute sponsors seminars on both domestic
and international issues.
   Bush will spend Thursday night in the Rockies and fly back
Friday to spend a bachelor weekend at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md.

   Israel called Sunday for the elimination of
chemical weapons in the Middle East and denied that Israel
possesses such arms.
   The statement, issued by the Defense Ministry, came two days
after Science Minister Yuval Neeman warned that Israel could
respond in kind if Iraq used chemical weapons against it.
   Neeman, who also heads Israel's space program, later said he had
been misunderstood.
   Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, has threatened in the past to
use chemical weapons against Israel if Iraq was attacked with
nuclear weapons.
   Sunday's statement said Israel ``is a signatory of the Geneva
Protocol of 1925 and abides by it.'' The protocol prohibits the use
of chemical weapons.
   The statement, issued by ministry spokesman Dan Naveh, expressed
``dismay'' that ``other countries who also are signatories of this
protocol have violated it.''
   ``Israel hopes that in the near future we may have a new
comprehensive convention for the total elimination of chemical
weapons, a convention that will deal with the Middle East problem
and Israel's security needs,'' the statement added.
   In Iraq, a spokesman for the Foreign Minister criticized the
United States for maintaining silence over Neeman's statement on
Friday.
   ``Everybody knows that Israel has all kinds of weapons of mass
destruction,'' said the spokesman, who was not identified. ``But we
are surprised that America and the West made a lot of fuss about
Iraq's weapons potential and kept silent on the statement by the
Isreli minister.''
   Saddam threatened in April to attack Israel with chemical
weapons if the Jewish state attacked Iraq with nuclear arms.
   ``In my opinion, we have an excellent response, and that is to
threaten (Saddam) Hussein with the same merchandise,'' Neeman said
Friday.
   Israeli officials have refused to discuss foreign reports that
the country has stockpiled nuclear arms. Although it is widely
believed that Israel has chemical weapons, officials have never
admitted it.

<TEXT>
   In her soon-to-be-released autobiography, Kitty
Dukakis says that the night she drank rubbing alcohol she didn't
realize what she was drinking was poisonous, according to reports
published Sunday.
   Mrs. Dukakis, the wife of former Democratic presidential nominee
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, chronicles her bouts with
alcohol and diet pill addiction in her book ``Now You Know.''
   In the book to be released in August by Simon &amp; Schuster, she
also tells of the shock she felt when she learned her mother was
born out of wedlock.
   The Boston Sunday Herald reported it had gathered details about
the closely guarded book from relatives and friends of the Dukakis
family. The Boston Sunday Globe also reported about some of the
items in the book.
   In the book, Mrs. Dukakis, 53, says that on the night of Nov. 7,
1989, when she drank the rubbing alcohol _ an incident that made
headlines _ she wasn't attempting suicide, the Herald reported.
   The rubbing-alcohol episode was another in a string of
disappointments for Mrs. Dukakis that started long before her
husband's defeat in the 1988 presidential election.
   In the book, Mrs. Dukakis recalls starting to take diet pills a
year after she learned her mother, Jane Goldberg Dickson, had been
adopted and illegitimate.
   Mrs. Dickson, who died in 1977, was the daughter of Margaret
Buxbaum, who had her daughter out of wedlock and offered the child
to Henry and Mabel Goldberg, a wealthy New York family. Buxbaum
gave the child up for adoption on condition she become the nanny
for the girl, the Herald said, citing unidentified sources.
   Mrs. Dukakis was reportedly told the truth about her mother when
she was 18, and Mrs. Dickson would not discuss the matter with her.
The shock stayed with Mrs. Dukakis for years.
   The future first lady of Massachusetts also suffered
disappointment in her first marriage at 19 to John Chaffetz. In the
book, Mrs. Dukakis blames her diet pill addiction and the failure
of the marriage, after four years, to her mother's hiding the truth
from her.
   Mrs. Dukakis later met Dukakis, and the two married in 1963.
   Over the next two decades, Mrs. Dukakis remained addicted to
diet pills. In 1980 she went to the Hazelden Foundation in
Minnesota for treatment.
   In the 1980s, however, her addiction turned to alcohol, and it
caused problems behind the scenes during her husband's failed 1988
presidential campaign. The Herald reported that Mrs. Dukakis twice
passed out from drinking on the stressful campaign trail.
   In March 1989, Mrs. Dukakis admitted publicly that she was an
alcoholic, after treatment at Edgehill Newport in Rhode Island.
   After drinking rubbing alcohol later that year, she again sought
treatment. She returned to Massachusetts in February to finish the
book, which was written with Jane Scovell.
   Mrs. Dukakis is currently being treated for manic depression and
sees a psychiatrist once a week, the Herald said.

<HEAD>Kuwait Seeks ``Just Settlement'' With Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait said Sunday it welcomed a meeting aimed at
settling differences with Iraq, but said both countries should have
a chance to air their grievances.
   Two weeks ago, Iraq accused its tiny neighbor of border
encroachments and producing more than its OPEC quota of oil, and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened use of military force.
   Kuwait said it hoped the talks, set Tuesday in Saudi Arabia,
would bring a ``just settlement of all pending problems'' between
the two countries ``in a manner ensuring the national sovereignty
and legitimate rights of each country.''
   The Kuwaiti statement stressed the need for ``objective and cool
dialogue'' but did not specify what Kuwait was seeking.
   The Saudi Press Agency said late Sunday that the meeting was
scheduled for Tuesday. The official Iraqi News Agency also
announced that the meeting would take place then.
   A diplomatic source in Saudi Arabia, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Kuwait had balked at Iraqi conditions for the
talks, saying that would amount to acknowledging all Iraqi charges
and demands beforehand.
   Mediators Egypt and Saudi Arabia had hoped to arrange earlier
talks between Iraq and Kuwait in the Saudi summer capital of
Jiddah, but they did not materialize.
   The Kuwait-Iraq tension eased somewhat last week after members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to
respect production quotas in an effort to reach a target price of
$21 per barrel, $3 above the previous target. The aim is to boost
the price of oil.
   Sunday's Kuwaiti statement, issued after the weekly Cabinet
meeting, said it hoped all OPEC states would adhere to the quotas
to ``boost cohesion of the organization and achieve the interest of
all parties concerned.''
   Diplomatic sources said Kuwait had demanded that, as a condition
for talks, Iraq withdraw troops sent to the 100-mile border during
the crisis.
   However, the sources said the 30,000 troops remained in place
and Kuwait apparently shelved that precondition.

<TEXT>
   At least 50 suspected Kurdish
guerrillas were killed in three days of stepped-up fighting against
the separatists, the regional governor's office announced Sunday.
   It described the action as one of the largest anti-guerrilla
operations in southeastern Turkey and said it was still being waged.
   Government troops and rebels clashed in the provinces of Siirt,
Sirnak and Hakkari, said the announcement.
   Local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
government authorities had armed more than 20,000 peasants, known
as village guards, to protect local communities.
   It could not be immediately determined if the guards had helped
the government troops during the operations.
   News coverage in the area has been restricted since April under
special security measures adopted by the government.
   The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist
group fighting to establish an independent Kurdistan in Turkey's
southeastern provinces bordering Iran, Iraq and Syria.

   An official with the agency that arranges tours
for Jewish teen-agers said Sunday he hoped a bomb explosion on a
beach that killed a 17-year-old Canadian will not frighten visitors
from Israel.
   Marnie Kimelman of Willowdale, Ontario, died of a shrapnel wound
Saturday after a bomb exploded on a Tel Aviv beach. She had been
visiting Israel on a tour organized by the Canadian Zionist
Federation.
   No group claimed responsibiliy for the explosion. Police
detained eight Arabs for questioning in the bombing.
   On Sunday, the 42 Canadians also on Miss Kimelman's tour
returned to the beach where she was killed for a brief memorial
service. Several other people on the tour were among the 19
slightly wounded in the blast.
   In Ottawa, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Sunday that
Canada was ``shocked and angered'' by what he described as ``acts
of senseless violence (which) only serve to deepen fear and
hatred.''
   The Canadians, who are on a six-week tour, are among 5,000 North
American youths who are participating in summer programs in Israel
this year.
   ``It is only natural after a tragic accident that people will
have a second thought, but I think if this happens then the
terrorists simply get what they want and nobody wants that,'' said
Gad Ben Ari, a spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency.
   ``This is very clearly a tragic event which could not be
prevented or anticipated,'' he said.
   Saar Kadmon, the Israeli tour guide for the Canadian group, said
at least 15 teen-agers who were on the beach when the bomb exploded
have asked to return to Canada and that ten families have asked
that their children be sent home.
   ``It's hard to argue with parents when they hear that even in
Tel Aviv it's not safe for their kids,'' Kadmon said on Israel army
radio.
   Ms. Kimelman was the fourth tourist and third Canadian killed
during the 31-month-long Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The other three were
among 16 people who died when a Palestinian grabbed the steering
wheel of a bus and sent it plunging down a ravine off the Tel
Aviv-Jerusalem highway in July 1989.
   In the revolt, 724 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers and civilians, and 45 Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians.

<HEAD>Sharon Presents Housing Plan for Expected 1 Million Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon presented a plan
Sunday for housing about 1 million immigrants _ mostly Soviet Jews
_ that is expected to cost $13.5 billion over the next five years.
   Sharon's plan, presented to the right-wing government's Cabinet,
does not include constructing new housing in occupied Arab
territories.
   The Cabinet held a five-hour debate on the program but made no
decision and scheduled further deliberations for a special meeting
Thursday, an assistant to Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubinstein said.
   Most of the housing will be needed for an expected massive
influx of Soviet Jews which has resulted from rising fears of
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, liberalized Soviet emigration
policies, and tighter U.S. restrictions on visas for Soviet Jews
going there.
   Already this year, 61,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated to Israel,
and 90,000 more may arrive by the end of the year.
   The immigration wave has pushed up rents and caused a housing
shortage, creating a potentially explosive ethnic and social
situation.
   According to Sharon's plan, details of which have been widely
reported in the Israeli media, the country will need 550,000 new
housing units in the next five years for Israeli families and an
estimated 1 million immigrants.
   Sharon has proposed purchasing locally or importing 50,000 house
trailers and 40,000 prefabricated homes.
   Of these, 3,000 house trailers and 20,000 prefabricated homes
would be bought immediately as part of an emergency package that
also includes renovating 8,500 government-owned apartments.
   The Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot said Sharon's plans call for
initial funding of $2.2 billion. The Israeli media reported
Sharon's plan would cost $13.5 billion over five years, but housing
officials would not confirm the figure.
   Sharon's new program is opposed by Finance Minister Yitzhak
Modai, who dislikes the idea of prefabricated housing for new
immigrants.
   Speaking Friday on Israel army radio, Modai suggested housing
Soviet immigrants in tent camps or barracks like those used for
Sephardic Jews arriving in the 1950s. He said the government should
concentrate on finding jobs for the new arrivals.
   After Sunday's Cabinet session, Modai said Sharon's plan was too
expensive, and he would present a ``more modest'' plan at
Thursday's Cabinet meeting.
   Israel has been seeking $400 million in loan guarantees from the
United States to help house the Soviet immigrants.
    The Bush administration has made any U.S. aid for helping
absorb Soviet Jewish immigrants conditional on an Israeli guarantee
that money would not help settle the new arrivals in areas outside
Israel's 1967 borders, including Arab east Jerusalem.
   Israel has declined to provide such a guarantee, saying it would
not encourage immigrants to move to the occupied territories but
would not prevent them from doing so either.
   Israeli officials have said only a fraction among the tens of
thousands of Soviet immigrants arriving since April 1989 have
settled in the occupied territories.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Looters hauled away carloads of
television sets and other appliances while vigilante squads guarded
some homes Sunday during the chaos of an armed uprising by Moslem
extremists.
   Fires broke out in several parts of the capital, Port-of-Spain,
and a thick cloud of acrid smoke hung over the city.
   A government-imposed curfew took effect in mid-afternoon, and
the streets were deserted _ except for looters.
   ``Everybody is trying to secure themselves because people don't
know what's going to happen,'' said Trinidanian Ian Mckenzie, who
was watching looters on the outskirts of Port-of-Spain. ``We don't
want our country this way. We are a democratic country.''
   In middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods, residents banded
together to stave off attacks. Several homes in the Westmoorings
suburb, about six miles northwest of the capital, were ransacked,
and residents fenced off the area to keep intruders away.
   A witness said he said two men _ armed with 12-gauge shotguns
and a .38-caliber revolver _ trying to shoot open a large safe by
the side of a road.
   Widespread looting broke out along the Churchill-Roosevelt
highway, the main artery between the airport and the capital.
People pulled their cars up to warehouses and filled them with
refrigerators, televisions and radios.
   Supermarkets, pharmacies, clothing, hardware and appliance
stores were systematically stripped by convoys of vehicles. Looting
also spread outside the capital to the villages of Barataria, San
Juan, Mount Hope and El Socorro.
   Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah broadcast an appeal over
government-run radio for looters to stop.
   ``My heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter
places to take foodstuffs. I can perhaps ask God's forgiveness for
this,'' he said.
   ``But when you line up a convoy of vehicles to take away items
like refrigerators, television sets and videos, that is not right.''
   Army and police patrolled downtown Port-of-Spain around the
Parliament building, known as Red House, where Prime Minister
Arthur Robinson was being held hostage by black Moslem rebels.
   But in many parts of the city, no police were visible. Some
people kept an eye out for police while friends looted stores.
   On Saturday, a witness in the Picadilly area of eastern
Port-of-Spain said about 50 policemen fired shots into the air to
stop the looters. But people ignored them and continued to plunder
stores.

   Cockroaches inspire most people to swat, smack
or stomp, or withdraw in disgust.
   But they inspire Jamie Buchsbaum to create sculpture, of a sort,
dressing giant dead roaches up in celebrity costumes.
   Buchsbaum, 26, is president of Cockroaches Unlimited, a business
he founded last October to market his cockroach creations.
   Pete Roach. Elvis Proachley. Santa Roach and his eight tiny
roachdeer. All have found a place in Buchsbaum's pantheon of pests.
   If it sounds disgusting, well, that's what Buchsbaum's after.
   ``Everyone recognizes roaches, and most people are pretty
disgusted by them,'' he said. ``I thought that would add to what I
was doing _ to pick the most disgusting insect and turn it into
something not disgusting.''
   Buchsbaum said he has made roach couture a serious pursuit for
about two years, starting in 1988 with a Santa Roach display.
   ``Everything kind of took off from there,'' he said.
   Buchsbaum said he gets most of his roaches after they die of
natural causes at the insect exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo, where
he works as a volunteer. These are not your average, domestic
roaches; they are nightmare-size exotics including the bat cave
cockroach and the South American giant.
   He stores the little corpses in the freezer until he is ready to
create.
   Before painting or clothing one, he positions its legs, then
bakes it for two hours.
   Buchsbaum's Elvis Proachley sculpture is a South American giant
roach displayed in Elvis Presley's trademark regalia _ white
jumpsuit, guitar, microphone and blue suede shoes.
   He acknowledged that there hasn't been a consumer stampede for
his creations.
   ``Everyone seems to think they're really neat, but as far as
buying, it hasn't been going too well,'' Buchsbaum said.
   The only poster of his creations that he has out on the market
so far _ ``Batroach, the Anti-trend'' _ has raised the ire of Time
Warner Inc., which owns the rights to Batman.
   Time Warner sent Buchsbaum a letter claiming the poster
infringed on its rights to Batman, said Buchsbaum's lawyer, Nancy
Greiwe.
   ``We're continuing to discuss the matter to work out a
resolution,'' Ms. Greiwe said.
   However that turns out, Buchsbaum, a research assistant at the
University of Cincinnati, isn't through with roaches.
   ``I definitely want to keep going with it, to see what I can do
_ as long as I don't lose too much money on it,'' he said.

   It's no more ``yo, ho, ho and a bottle
of rum'' for the Navy, which is trying to deglamorize alcohol _ a
switch of long-standing tradition in its clubs for enlisted men and
officers.
   ``It's not like it used to be. I remember those days when you
would just get totally bombed and stay at the clubs until you
passed out,'' said Pensacola Naval Air Station spokesman Harry
White.
   The change in Navy philosophy is evident at Navy bases here and
in Pensacola, where anti-drinking programs abound and recreation
and other activities are becoming popular on Navy bases.
   ``We want to get across to sailors that there are ways to enjoy
their leisure time other than drinking,'' said Julian Barrs,
director of Mayport Naval Station's morale, welfare and recreation
department.
   Nick Young, spokesman for Jacksonville Naval Air Station and a
former sailor, said he's seen a 180-degree change in the Navy's
philosphy about alcohol.
   For years U.S. sailors were given a daily ration of spirits
called a grog with their bread, salt pork and peas _ a tradition
rooted in the rum-powered British navy. The practice was banned in
1862, and one lament went: ``They've raised his pay three cents a
day but stopped his grog forever.''
   All booze was banned in 1914, when the blue-nosed teetotaler
Josephus Daniels as secretary of the Navy ended the custom of
officers having wine in their quarters. He earned the bitter
nickname ``Grape Juice Josephus.''
   Even so, drinking was the rule at Navy parties.
   Now it often is the exception, Young said.
   ``I attended a going-away party at noon and the only alcoholic
beverage was consumed by the guest of honor. Everyone else had
Cokes and iced tea,'' Young said recently. ``Drinking is thoroughly
frowned upon.''
   The Navy now realizes that alcohol can cause work, family and
health problems, he said.
   Happy hours when sailors used to guzzle down two brews for the
price of one are now forbidden. Free food, instead, now induces
sailors into the clubs instead of extra booze.
   ``Our bartenders are instructed to stop serving sailors before
they get too many,'' Barrs said.
   In addition, the naval bases in Jacksonville and Pensacola use a
designated-driver program or arrange transportation to keep
drinkers from behind the wheel.
   Drinking is not as popular among Navy personnel as it once was,
partially because the average sailor has changed from a young
single man to one with a wife and children, Barrs said.
   ``We've got a lot of young sailors with families and drinking is
not that attractive to them anymore,'' Barrs said.
   A new $1.2 million Mayport Sports Club opening in October will
feature indoor and outdoor sports activities such as volleyball and
basketball. Mayport's new sports bar is one of three being opened
on bases by Harborage, a Dallas company. The others are at Norfolk
and San Diego, Barrs said.
   The switch to the sports bars was partially resulted from a 1986
study conducted for the Navy by the University of Georgia on how
sailors liked to spend their leisure time and what they wanted in
recreation and entertainment.
   ``They wanted a different atmosphere in clubs,'' Barrs said.
   Cecil Field Naval Air Station's club just underwent a $1
million, seven-month renovation and has reopened as Ace's Place, a
sports bar, with a new chief petty officer's club and refurbished
dining and dance areas.
   At Jacksonville Naval Air Station, $1.9 million in improvements
are being made to the enlistment personnel club and adding a dining
room, game room, ballroom and fast-food restaurant.
   ``The main thrust is to give people activities that are
alternative to sitting in a bar and drinking,'' Young said.
   At the Pensacola Naval Air Station, a sports bar is in the
planning stages, White said.
   Besides providing an atmosphere that reduces drinking, the clubs
are having to scramble to find ways to recoup the money that had
been spent on alcohol.
   And come October, the Navy is cutting off all funds to base
clubs.
   ``They have to be self-sufficient or they close,'' Young said.

<HEAD>Winona Company Buys Rights to Irving Berlin's Sheet Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINONA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest print music publisher
has purchased the distribution and printing rights to Irving
Berlin's vast sheet music treasury.
   Keith Mardak, president of Hal Leonard Publishing Corp., said
the Winona-based company plans to use Berlin's songs to develop new
publications, including a deluxe coffee table-style song book and a
children's song book.
   Mardak would not disclose the purchase price, but said the
company will earn about $500,000 a year in gross sales from the
deal.
   Berlin, who died last September at age 101, composed nearly
1,000 songs, including such classics as ``White Christmas,''
``Puttin' on the Ritz'' and ``God Bless America.''
   The sheet music will be taken from New York City to Winona,
where it will be stored in warehouses, according to Dan Bauer, Hal
Leonard's controller.
   Hal Leonard already publishes instrumental and choral
collections of Berlin's music.
   Hal Leonard, founded in 1947, is the world's largest print music
publisher. It has branches in Milwaukee, England, Spain and West
Germany. The Winona office of the company is primarily responsible
for printing, warehousing and distribution.

   Rain was scattered over the western Plains and across parts of
the South on Sunday, and it was cool over the western Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed during the afternoon over
the central High Plains, including eastern Colorado, southeastern
Wyoming and westernmost Nebraska, as a cold front approached from
the north.
   Rain also was scattered over the southern High Plains and the
upper Midwest as showers and thunderstorms developed along and
ahead of another cold front crossing the central part of the nation.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms were over the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast. Showers and thunderstorms
were fairly numerous over eastern North Carolina and along the
middle Atlantic Coast.
   A few showers and thunderstorms formed over northern New England.
   Rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT were less
than one inch.
   From late Saturday into Sunday morning, locally heavy rain fell
from the southern and central high Plains to the upper Mississippi
Valley.
   Rainfall totals in northeastern Nebraska ranged up to 3.20
inches at Elgin. Amounts in north-central Iowa included 4.21 inches
at Lake Mills, 3.56 inches at Northwood and 2.48 inches at Dubuque.
   The Cedar River at Waterloo, Iowa, is expected to crest at 17
feet by Tuesday, 5 feet above flood stage, the National Weather
Service said. Flooding of some residential areas is expected around
Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Vinton, it said.
   Hot weather continued west of the Rockies, and temperatures were
already in the 90s by midday as far north as Washington state.
   Overnight temperatures dipped into the 50s in the northern and
central high Plains and Sunday morning lows were in the 40s and 50s
in the Rockies.
   Pueblo, Colo., dipped to a record low of 52. The previous record
for the date had stood since 1892.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 37 degrees in West
Yellowstone, Mont.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germany and Japan are threatening to beat
America on the economic front because they make better use of their
people, the president of the National Urban League said Sunday.
   ``America is going to lose the economic war with Japan and
Europe unless it finds a way to use its secret weapon _ the
underused, underestimated, underserved minority that is the core of
the future work force,'' said John E. Jacob, head of the civil
rights group.
   In the keynote speech to the group's 80th annual conference,
Jacob called for a summit meeting of President Bush and other
leaders from government, business, labor, education and community
organizations to devise a plan for improved education and
job-training focusing on minority youths.
   Jacob also reiterated the league's program for economic and
social improvement of the nation's cities, called the Urban
Marshall Plan after the program to help Europe recover from World
War II.
   He said the plan would involve repairing and modernizing the
cities' physical infrastructure, including roads and public
transportation. It also would involve investments in training and
social programs for disadvantaged citizens, he said.
   ``Understand that we're not going to be able to remain
competitive unless we deal with the infrastructure of our cities
and the human infrastructure of our people by making them better
educated, by making them more technologically literate, and by
including them into the mainstream,'' Jacob told a news conference.
   Money for such a program would come from cuts in the defense
budget, he said. He estimated that about $50 billion should be
available for rebuilding cities.
   The four-day conference is to include speeches by federal
anti-drug czar William Bennett, New York Mayor David Dinkins, and
Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder.

<TEXT>
   Darkness and rugged terrain slowed the
rescue of eight injured victims of a helicopter crash that also
killed five soldiers, mostly Green Berets, officials said Sunday.
   The modified UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crashed during a combat
training mission on a rugged, forested mountainside about five
miles south of this Army base in western Arkansas late Friday night.
   It was one of two fatal military helicopter crashes Friday
night. The second, in the Southern California desert, killed two
Marines and injured three others.
   Officials said they were mystified by the Arkansas crash.
Weather was good and the pilot did not appear to have had vision
obstacles, officials said. The helicopter's payload was heavier
than normal.
   ``Usually with vision problems you run into something,'' Fort
Chaffee spokesman Cecil Green said. ``This one didn't run into
anything ... It went down.''
   Rescuers had to walk more than a mile in darkness and didn't
reach the crash site until about 2 a.m. Saturday, 2{ hours after
the crash. The site was remote, the terrain steep and the
underbrush thick, said Fire Chief Cecil Tuck.
   ``We fell down a lot,'' Tuck said.
   When the two four-man rescue crews arrived, they instructed
evacuation helicopters to land about 250 yards from the wreckage.
Two helicopters were used to airlift the injured.
   The injured were admitted to St. Edward Mercy Medical Center at
Fort Smith between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., a hospital spokesman said.
   Seven of the soldiers were still hospitalized Sunday, Green
said. One had a critical head injury while the others, includind
the two pilots, were in stable condition. The eighth patient was
released Saturday.
   Rescue personnel did their best considering the terrain, said
Col. Myrt Webb Jr., the base commander.
   ``I don't see how it could have been done any quicker,'' he said.
   A team of investigators from the Army Safety Center in Fort
Rucker, Ala., returned to the crash scene Sunday morning, beginning
a probe that is expected to take several months, Green said.
   Green said he did not know whether the pilots were wearing
night-vision goggles, although that would have been normal
procedure.
   Some pilots say the goggles, which electronically enhance
moonlight and starlight, fail to pick up looming clouds and limit
peripheral vision. The Army said it had improved the goggles after
the were blamed for a 1988 crash at Fort Campbell, Ky., that killed
17 soldiers.
   The UH-60 helicopter was destroyed, and the investigating team
took it out in pieces, said Webb.
   The helicopter and the men aboard were participating in
preliminary maneuvers of an exercise to begin next week involving
about 3,000 soldiers.
   The exercise involves a mock war in which a task force is
dropped behind enemy lines in a made-up foreign country, said Green.
   The helicopter that crashed was designed to carry 11
combat-equipped passengers with a payload of 2,640 pounds. Army
officials said the chopper had been modified to carry 13 passengers
and a heavier payload.
   Tuck said conditions at the crash site indicated the payload,
which was classified, was very heavy. Workers performed cleanup
work related to the helicopter's payload for about an hour after
rescuing the injured, he said.
   The commanding officer, who was killed in the crash, was Capt.
Gregory W. Sandborn, of the 1st Special Forces at Fort Lewis, Wash.
   Most of the soldiers aboard the helicopter were soldiers from
the 10th Special Forces based at Fort Devens, Miss., or from the
160th Task Force based at Hunter Army Airfield, Ga.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Black Moslem rebel Abu Bakr, long
at odds with authorities, says their decision to spend $500,000 on
a memorial to a dead woman leader was the ``straw that broke the
camel's back.''
   Shortly after his followers seized Parliament house Friday, Bakr
commandeered the government television station and announced he had
overthrown Prime Minister Arthur Robinson and was holding him
hostage with his Cabinet.
   Speaking to the country on television, he accused Robinson's
4-year-old government of mismanagement and corruption. He singled
out Robinson's announcement on June 23 that a monument would be
built in honor of Jean Miles, a senior public servant who died more
than a decade ago.
   ``That was the straw that broke the camel's back: the allocation
of $500,000 to create a concrete statue to this woman, while poor
people all over the country are starving,'' he said.
   Bakr, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-2-inch, charismatic leader, has
long considered himself a spokesman for the poor.
   A former mounted policeman who converted to Islam while studying
in Canada in the early 1980s, Bakr founded and has been the leader
for six years of the Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune. It is on eight
acres of former swamp land on the western edge of Port-of-Spain,
the capital.
   The rebel leader, in his late-40s, is married and has a son and
daughter believed to be attending the University of Toronto. His
wife, Annisa, is an executive for the Trinidad and Tobago
Industrial Development Corp.
   Another major source of friction with authorities is the city
council's contention that Bakr built his commune without a clear
title to the land.
   In the early 1970s, the late Prime Minister Eric Williams
donated the land to East Indian Moslems to build whatever they
wanted. But they never picked up the offer.
   Abu Bakr returned from Canada in 1984 and grabbed the land,
saying his black Moslems had a right to it.
   He built a mosque in the center and living quarters for his 250
to 300 followers. Four major buildings include a kitchen for the
poor and a large school.
   The dispute came to a head in the 1980s when Bakr was jailed for
several weeks for contempt of court when he failed to answer
charges of illegal occupation brought by the council.
   Over the years, the commune has been raided by police looking
for arms and ammunition. They found a few rifles and small amounts
of ammunition.
   Three months ago, police and defense force soldiers seized a
portion of the commune where Bakr was constructing a new building.
Bakr sought a court order to remove the troops.
   A week ago, High Court Judge Ivol Blackman ruled against Bakr.
   Another irritant was the government's recent refusal to
distribute free medical supplies and pharmaceuticals Bakr wanted to
donate to people of the island.
   He said he had received the supplies from a U.N. agency.
However, it was widely believed in Trinidad that they came from
Libya.
   Bakr is thought to receive financial support from Libya and has
visited that North African country several times.
   He has also been highly critical of the government's record on
fighting drugs and even formed a paramilitary squad to raid drug
dealers. This earned him the enmity of the police.
   Moslems in mostly Hindu and Christian Trinidad make up 6 percent
of the population of 1.3 million people.
   There are only a small number of black Moslems outside Bakr's
group. Most are East Indians, who consider the blacks as
opportunists guided by politics more than the Koran.
   A Moslem leader in Canada who knew Bakr when he converted to
Islam, said he was ``committed to social justice.''
   Hardon Salamat, head of the Toronto and Region Islamic
Congregation, said in an interview that he thinks Bakr's action
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.''
   Salamat said Bakr's group receives financing from Moslems around
the world, including those in Toronto and Montreal.

   The nose gear on a Pan Am Express flight
carrying 44 people collapsed as the plane landed Sunday, but no one
was injured, officials said.
   Flight 4805 from Boston landed at John F. Kennedy International
Airport at 5:57 p.m. after two approaches, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
   On the previous approaches, the plane's instrument panel
indicated problems with the nose gear, Bergen said. The pilot put
the aircraft down on the third approach, and the gear collapsed.
   The plane, a four-engine turboprop, de Havilland Dash 7, was
carrying 41 passengers, two cockpit crew members and one flight
attendant, said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon. The passengers
got off safely without using emergency chutes.
   Pan Am Express is a regional airline and subsidiary of Pan Am
World Airways, Hanlon said.

<TEXT>
   A gunman took more than 100 hostages in a London
nightclub and demanded a plane to fly to Beirut on Sunday, but he
surrendered to police and freed his captives.
   The 10{-hour siege ended when the gunman was persuaded to leave
his last six hostages and walk up a staircase where police were
waiting, said Detective Superintendent Alex Edwards of Scotland
Yard.
   The gunman was identified early Monday as Hani Elrayes, a
30-year-old London importer and exporter. He was charged with false
imprisonment, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life,
perpetrating a bomb hoax and making threats to kill.
   Police said he would appear later in the day at Bow Street
magistrates' court.
   On Sunday night, also police detained a man and a woman at
separate addresses and confiscated shotgun parts, British
Broadcasting Corp. TV news reported. Both were being questioned by
police in connection with the seige, but there were no details.
   Police said some hostages needed medical attention and one was
taken out on a stretcher. They were examined by doctors at the
scene but none needed to be hospitalized.
   The hostages included members of the Kuwaiti royal family,
according to Yacoub Ibrahim, a witness. The club, Tokyo Joe's on
Clarges Street off Piccadilly, is a favorite haunt of Middle
Easterners and Scotland Yard confirmed a number of Arab VIPs had
been there, though it gave no names.
   The gunman, who appeared to be Lebanese, had been armed with a
12-bore shotgun, a rifle, a bayonet, a replica hand gun and a fake
bomb, Edwards said.
   ``The bomb was a sophisticated hoax,'' Edwards said. ``It
appears he had put some great effort into his planning.''
   Edwards said his motive for taking hostages remained a mystery.
   Several hostages said the man claimed relatives of his or his
English wife were being held hostage in Beirut.
   The club's owner, Hrad Darian, said the gunman lectured the
Arabs among the hostages.
   ``His major complaint was that his Arab sister countries, like
Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria, are not giving enough support to the
Palestinians,'' Darian said.
   But Edwards, who commanded the operation, said the gunman had
been drinking heavily and appeared to have taken drugs.
   His demands changed constantly and at one point, the gunman
threatened to kill himself, Edwards said.
   Bartender Peter Antonello said the gunman demanded a bus and
plane to take him to Beirut with 60 Arab hostages.
   ``He just said he was doing it for his wife who had gone to
Beirut with their three children this morning,'' the barman said.
   ``A lot of what he said just didn't make sense. But at one stage
he said: `God sent me to do it and I don't care if I burn myself
up,''' Antonello said.
   The barman said he was forced to help the man count the
hostages, which at the time totaled 115.
   When the man burst into the club about 1:45 a.m., he fired one
gun and told club members to ``get downstairs,'' said doorman
Dennis Tuerena, 38, who escaped with two others and alerted police.
   Armed officers surrounded the club and detectives started
lengthy negotiations with the man. Many patrons managed to escape
and some were released, including two freed by the gunman in
exchange for two smoked salmon sandwiches, Edwards said.
   Antonello said the gunman forced several British girls to sit in
front of him on a coffee table as a human shield while he crouched
behind them to avoid any possibility of being hit by a police
marksman.
   Christina Broderick, 20, one of several young British women the
gunman used as a human shield, said she escaped when he fell over
after drinking heavily and snorting cocaine.
   ``The gunman had a button on his belt which was connected to
electrical wiring and what he claimed was TNT,'' she said. ``He
kept calling to the police, saying `Come and check it, it's real.'''
   She said she believed he hoped to exchange some of the Arab
hostages for relatives in Beirut.
   When the siege ended at 12:10 p.m., the gunman, wrapped in a red
blanket that covered his head, emerged first and was searched
before being bundled into a police vehicle.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of his first acts as president,
political newcomer Alberto Fujimori dismissed the heads of the navy
and air force but refused Sunday to explain the decision.
   The moves were widely seen as an effort by Fujimori _ a
political outsider with little support in Congress or among the
country's established parties _ to impose his authority over the
military. The military overthrew a civilian government in 1968 and
ruled the country until 1980.
   Fujimori _ the upset winner in June's elections _ made the
changes late Saturday night just hours after he was sworn in as
president, and he confirmed the dismissals at a news conference
Sunday.
   At his first news conference, Fujimori also announced a bank
holiday for Monday and Tuesday. He said the banks would be closed
to help prepare the way for emergency economic measures he planned
to announce later in the week.
   Peru is facing one of its worst economic crises ever, with
inflation running at 3,000 percent a year.
   The new president said his government needed at least $700
million in emergency economic aid this year to feed and provide
basic services to the country's poor.
   Fujimori also said he wanted to restore Peru's standing with the
international financial community by resuming payments on its
foreign debt, which now totals $20 billion.
   His predecessor, Alan Garcia, had suspended debt payments in
1986, causing Peru to be cut off by international lenders.
   Regarding the military changes, Fujimori said he was confident
that the armed forces would continue to respect the powers of the
presidency to the same degree as in recent years.
   ``I must deny that there exists any discontent in the armed
forces,'' Fujimori said.
   On Saturday, Fujimori removed Gen. German Vucetich as head of
the air force, replacing him with Gen. Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez.
Press reports had raised allegations of corruption against Vucetich.
   He also appointed Adm. Luis Montes Lecaros to replace Adm.
Alfonso Panizo as head of the navy.
   However, the new president retained Gen. Jorge Zegarra as head
of the army, the most powerful of the three branches of the armed
forces.
   There had been recurring rumors before Fujimori defeated
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the presidential race that the navy
might back a military coup.
   High-ranking sources in Garcia's government had said senior navy
officers were plotting a military takeover if Fujimori won the
election by a narrow margin.
   But the 52-year-old former college professor _ the son of
Japanese immigrants _ won a landslide victory.
   Panizo told the newspaper La Republica that such dismissals had
not accompanied previous changes of government. The ousted navy
commander said he expected an explanation from the new president.
   Asked at a news conference about Panizo's remarks, Fujimori
refused to explain his decision.
   ``The president does not have to give explanations,'' he said.
   He added that ``the laws give this right (to dismiss military
commanders) to the president.''
   Earlier this year, a leading television newsman, Cesar
Hilderbrandt, accused Vucetich of making money for himself by
manipulating air force funds deposited in private banks. Vucetich
has denied the corruption allegations.
   In his inaugural address Saturday, Fujimori pledged to wage a
campaign against what he described as widespread government
corruption.

<TEXT>
   The nation's governors moved Sunday toward
endorsing a Democratic-led call for a national commission to
investigate the savings-and-loan crisis in what one governor called
a ``vote of no confidence'' in the federal response so far.
   On a day when the National Governors' Association broke from its
normal bipartisan consensus, the group's executive committee voted
to send the full governors a resolution to investigate the S&amp;L
bailout and find a way for ``equitable recovery'' of taxpayer money
spent on the bailout.
   The action came on a busy opening day of the governors' annual
summer conference, which concludes Tuesday.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat, predicted Congress
and President Bush would ignore the S&amp;L request, directed at them.
   But he said the statement amounted to ``a vote of no-confidence
in federal action'' on S&amp;Ls.
   ``It's really a way to say we don't have a lot of confidence in
what's happening so far,'' Blanchard said.
   Republican governors mounted a futile effort to strip the
recommendation of a commission from a statement of concern over the
S&amp;Ls. Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico called it ``a
feel-good'' vote, and Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri said it would
only delay any solution.
   ``We don't need rocket scientists and commissions _ we need
action,'' Ashcroft said.
   The vote came after the governors divided in a partisan dispute
on education _ a subject on which they previously had voiced only
consensus _ before tentatively agreeing on the makeup of a panel
that would grade states on their progress in education.
   At Democrats insistence, they added a provision that the panel
also vote on the federal government's progress toward meeting
education goals.
   Democrats, concerned that they not give up a political advantage
to the White House and Republicans, forced cancellation of a
bipartisan task force meeting on education reforms while they met
alone.
   They met later in private with GOP colleagues and White House
officials and announced a tentative agreement, but not before
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who is
co-chairman of the governors' bipartisan task force on education
reform, blasted the Democrats. He said they were disrupting
consensus and trying ``to polarize this.''
   ``If partisanship is more important than education, then I'll
let them defend that,'' Campbell said.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, a former chairman of the
governors' association, defended President Bush's budget before the
governors and said Bush would insist on fundamental budget reform
as part of any deficit-reduction package.
   Sununu was politely received and only gently questioned about
the Bush administration's latest proposal to raise revenues by
limiting the deduction for state income taxes by federal taxpayers.
   The S&amp;L resolution was tacked onto an existing policy statement
Sununu had authored when he was governor of New Hampshire.
   Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the Democratic
governors, noted to Sununu that when Sununu was chairman of the
NGA, ``One of the concerns you raised at that time was how to
protect the revenue base of state and local government.''
   Sununu said he could not comment on details still being
negotiated with congressional budget leaders but said the
administration's preference was for Bush's proposed budget, now
virtually discarded, which had no such tax increase.
   ``That's consistent with the concerns you raised,'' Sununu said.
   The governors have written the administration opposing the
elimination of state tax deductibility, saying it would increase
pressure on the states to limit or roll back taxes.
   Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia was one of those pushing the
resolution on S&amp;Ls. He said he was not trying to attack the Bush
administration but wanted the commission to act ``without any
desire to protect the reputation of those responsible.''
   ``It's not a witch hunt that I'm interested in,'' he said before
the governors met. ``The question is how did we get in this
quagmire,'' he said.
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, a Democrat, pushed a proposal
calling for regions hardest hit by the S&amp;L collapse to pay more of
the bailout cost. But the resolution the governors took up did not
refer to regional inequities.
   The dispute over the education panel marked the first time in
recent years that the governors have voiced anything other than
bipartisan agreement on the issues they debate. The Democrats'
unscheduled meetings ran for more than two hours.
   The Democrats' restiveness followed a private meeting they held
a day earlier in nearby Pascagoula, Miss.
   Some Democrats voiced concerns privately that they were turning
over too much influence to Republicans by giving President Bush
authority to put some members on the judging panel.
   The panel, recommended by the governors in their meeting last
winter, would be made up of governors, members of Congress and
White House appointees.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, co-chairman of the education panel,
said the dispute was resolved with a plan to put on the panel six
governors, three from each party; four Bush administration
officials; and two members of Congress from each party, who would
have no voting power.
   White House domestic policy adviser Roger Porter also agreed to
the plan.
   The governors rejected a proposal by House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, that education specialists be included.
   The panel would be given authority to issue a report card on
each state's progress in meeting education goals. Clinton said the
governors wanted the panel to also issue reports on how the federal
government was doing in meeting education goals the governors and
Bush agreed on last fall in a meeting in Charlottesville, Va.
   The governors on Saturday released a report calling for a
significant overhaul of the nation's schools, including a
de-emphasis on grouping elementary and secondary students by age or
narrow categories of ability.

   Manuel Noriega's longtime personal banker was
convicted with five other people in federal court Sunday in a
scheme to launder $32 million in cocaine profits for Colombia's
Medellin cartel.
   Prosecutors hailed it as a precedent-setting case, the first in
which international bankers have been convicted under U.S.
money-laundering laws, and as a key victory in the war on drugs.
   The verdicts came after seven days of jury deliberations and a
6-month-long trial of five international bankers and a Colombian
businessman associated with the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
   Convicted of conspiracy and various money laundering counts were
Amjad Awan, Miami-based assistant director of BCCI's Latin American
division and onetime banker to the deposed Panamanian leader; four
other ex-employees of BCCI; and a Colombian businessman.
   The verdicts were read shortly before noon Sunday in a courtroom
packed with friends and relatives of the accused.
   The defendants showed little emotion, but people in the gallery
broke into wails, wept and hugged one another and shouted curses in
a tumultuous scene following the verdicts. One woman appeared to
faint, then ran screaming from the courtroom when she recovered.
   ``Six months in court, and for this?'' said an angry Gloria
Bilgrami, whose husband, Akbar A. Bilgrami, and three other
defendants are natives of Pakistan. ``All this for lies. ... So
this is America.''
   Defense attorneys had little comment, but one vowed appeals.
   In a statement issued in Washington, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said, ``Money laundering is the secret accomplice of
death-dealing drug traffickers, and today's guilty verdicts ... are
significant victories in our efforts to dismantle the drug cartels'
ability to hide their tainted profits in the worldwide banking
system.''
   ``This case is important to the United States of America,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Jackowski, ``because it shows that
those who sit in the ivory tower of society, the bankers in the
gray suits, they don't touch the dope but they should know that if
they violate the law and they are convicted they're going to jail.''
   An 11-member panel decided the case after one original juror was
kicked off last week for independently phoning a reputed member of
the Medellin cocaine cartel while the jury was deliberating.
   Jurors, ordered sequestered following the incident, reached
their decision late Saturday, but U.S. District Judge William
Terrell Hodges delayed announcing it to give out-of-town attorneys
time to get to court.
   Awan and the other defendants were arrested Oct. 6, 1988, at a
bachelor party and wedding staged by the U.S. Customs Service to
lure them to Tampa.
   An undercover agent who infiltrated the ring had brought in
another undercover agent posing as his girlfriend. They became part
of the suspects' social and business circles and later announced
their engagement.
   Wedding invitations were sent and the suspects were put up at a
posh resort for the weekend. Limousines, chauffeured by undercover
agents, ferried the suspects to the bachelor bash. But instead of
stepping out of an elevator into a penthouse suite, the suspects
walked into the arms of federal agents waiting with handcuffs.
   They were accused of conspiring with an undercover Customs agent
to launder $14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six
U.S. cities. During the two-year investigation, the government
processed $32 million in partnership with a Medellin cash launderer.
   Before the trial began in January, two subsidiaries of the
Luxembourg-based bank pleaded guilty to the money-laundering
charges and forfeited $15 million to the government, more than
triple the previous largest penalty ever assessed against a bank.
   In addition to the hefty fine, BCCI, one of the world's largest
private financial institutions with 72 offices, was put on five
years probation under the Federal Reserve System and agreed to open
the books to prosecutors investigating Noriega, a BCCI customer.
   BCCI, in a statement issued from its London office, said the
offenses charged in the case were ``contrary to the expressed
written policies'' of the bank and were not known to senior
management or its board of directors.
   Also convicted Sunday were Ian Howard and Sibte Hassan of BCCI's
Paris branch; Akbar A. Bilgrami of the bank's Miami branch; Syed
Aftab Hussain, who worked for BCCI in Panama; and the Colombian
businessman, aircraft broker Rudolph Armbrecht.
   Hodges ordered all the defendants taken into custody by U.S.
marshals, but he did not set a date for sentencing. The six each
face up to five years on the main conspiracy charge. They also
individually face sentencing on specific money-laundering counts
that each have a 20-year maximum.
   Hassan was convicted on three of six money-laundering counts;
the others were all convicted of all the money-laundering counts
lodged against them: Awan on 14, Bilgrami on 21, Hussain on 19,
Armbrecht on nine and Howard on four.
   Prosecutors portrayed the defendants as greedy men eager to help
hide hefty sums of cash from drug sales in American cities through
intricate global banking transactions.
   Defense attorneys, however, maintained their clients didn't know
they were breaking any laws and were set up by overzealous
government agents who turned what seemed to be a legitimate banking
relationship into a money-laundering business.

   Mongolians narrowly elected
Communist Party chief Gombojavyn Ochirbat in a key legislative race
of this nation's first multiparty elections, early results showed
Monday.
   More than 90 percent of eligible voters, some braving heavy
rains that washed out roads, cast ballots Sunday to determine
whether the Communist Party should stay in power after nearly seven
decades of authoritarian rule.
   By holding its first multiparty election ever, this remote
Central Asian nation joins the ranks of Soviet-bloc countries that
are experimenting with democracy.
   Results from individual races began trickling in Monday morning.
   In the most dramatic race of the election, the Communist Party
leader narrowly defeated his non-Communist challenger, Ganbold, a
29-year-old lawyer. Ganbold's party, the Party of New Progress,
said Ochirbat won slightly more than 51 percent of the vote in Ulan
Bator's legislative District 12, to Ganbold's nearly 48 percent.
Some votes were invalid.
   Nationwide figures will not be ready until Tuesday, said
Sharvamdy, secretary of the National Election Commission, who like
most Mongolians uses only one name.
   Both the Communists and the opposition say they want to
establish rule by law, reform the stagnant economy and build closer
ties to the West. However, the opposition claims the Communists are
insincere and chiefly seek to stay in power.
   The Communists were guaranteed control of the national
legislature because of a shortage of opposition candidates.
   But the five new non-Communist parties, born out of popular
demonstrations, hoped to win in a smaller body that will meet
between annual sessions of the full legislature.
   ``It's just a beginning,'' said Jargaal, a member of the
opposition Social Democratic Party who was observing balloting at
the Gachuurt State Farm outside Ulan Bator. She said more time was
needed for Mongolians accustomed to a one-party system to gain the
courage to join another party.
   Entire families arrived by horse, truck and car at Gachuurt's
school. A holiday atmosphere prevailed. The elderly wore their best
clothes, usually traditional herders' costumes.
   Sukhe, a 69-year-old veteran of World War II, pinned his 15
medals on his chest, some from the war and some for civilian honors.
   ``It is a happy event,'' he explained.
   In some parts of the country, heavy rains cut roads and
telephone lines, and election officials in Ulan Bator sent
emissaries by plane to learn the results, Sharvamdy said.
   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (6 p.m. EDT Saturday) and closed at 10
p.m. (7 a.m. EDT). As of an hour before closing, 91.9 percent of
the approximately 1 million eligible voters had cast ballots, the
official said.
   Local election commissions began counting ballots by hand
immediately after the polls closed, and most expected to finish by
Monday morning. The results are to be telephoned and then carried
to the National Election Commission in Ulan Bator for computation.
   Voters selected candidates for the national, provincial and
local legislatures and, on a separate ballot, selected their
favorite party. The results of the party popularity poll will be
used to allocate the 53 seats in the Small Hural, which will meet
between sessions of the 430-seat Great People's Hural and have
considerable power.
   The poll gives opposition parties that did not have time to put
up candidates a chance to win Small Hural seats. The opposition
parties had complained that nominations were already made in many
districts by the time they registered.
   The Communists, formally known as the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party, legalized opposition parties only in April,
following mass demonstrations for democratic reform that were
inspired by the ouster of Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   Mongolia's Communists also overhauled their leadership and
declared their readiness to make democratic reforms.
   A Communist election victory would not necessarily indicate
popular confidence in the party. Urban votes carry less weight than
rural votes under the new election law, skewing results in favor of
the Communists. They are weakest in the cities where there is more
knowledge of the outside world.
   Having a choice was confusing for some voters.
   ``In the past, there was only one name on ballots,'' said
Davaasambuu, chief of the election commission at a polling station
in western Ulan Bator. ``This time there are two names and you have
to choose.''
   Observers came from Britain, the United States, Poland and the
Soviet Union and Hungary. None reported major problems.

   The spiritual leader of the world's Eastern
Orthodox Christians ended his historic U.S. tour Sunday with a
service for thousands of people before flying home to Turkey.
   The service capped the 27-day visit by Ecumenical Patriarch
Dimitrios I, the first patriarch ever to visit the Western
Hemisphere.
   About 7,500 followers attended Sunday's three-hour divine
liturgy at the Hynes Auditorium, said Sophia Nibi, spokeswoman for
the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Boston.
   The 75-year-old primate led the service, assisted by Archbishop
Iakovos, primate of the Greek Orthodox church in the Americas, and
Bishop Methodios of Boston.
   The liturgy included hymns sung in Greek and a recitation in
both Greek and English of the Nicene Creed, a testimonial of faith
for the Christian Church.
   Dimitrios left for Istanbul, Turkey, on Sunday evening, Nibi
said.
   The primate, who spent five days in Boston, was especially
delighted by the young people who were among the area's 200,000
Eastern Orthodox Christians flocking to greet him, she said.
   Dimitrios on Friday received an honorary degree from Hellenic
College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology. He spent
Saturday resting and visiting relatives in Quincy.
   The patriarch began his U.S. tour July 2 in Washington, where he
blessed about 3,000 young people.
   He also visited New York City, Perth Amboy, N.J.; Allentown and
Johnstown, Pa.; San Francisco; Chicago; and Buffalo, N.Y., where he
made a side trip to Niagara Falls.
   Dimitrios is the spiritual leader of 180 million to 250 million
Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide.
   The United States is home to an estimated 6 million Eastern
Orthodox Christians, a general label that covers the Greek,
Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Albanian, Bulgarian and Serbian
traditions.
   Roughly parallel to the Roman Catholic pope, the Eastern
Orthodox patriarch presides over a confederation of self-governing
churches mostly in Eastern Europe.
   Dimitrios is also known as the archbishop of Constantinope
(modern-day Istanbul). The archbishop's office traces back to the
apostle Andrew. The office of pope traces back to Andrew's brother,
the apostle Peter.
   Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism split almost 1,000 years
ago over differences about the origin of the Holy Spirit and over
the Roman pope's claim of authority over the eastern church. But
the two churches maintain similar beliefs on most points.

<HEAD>Judge to Hear Arguments on Pennsylvania Abortion Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>READING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most restrictive state abortion law in
the nation goes before a federal judge Monday in a case that could
eventually give the U.S. Supreme Court another chance to reevaluate
Roe vs. Wade.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III is to hear
arguments on whether bills passed by the state Legislature in 1988
and 1989 illegally restricted the rights of women to abortions.
   Should the bill end up in the Supreme Court, as many observers
expect, it would be the second time in a decade that Huyett has
considered a key abortion rights challenge on its way to the high
court.
   Huyett rejected provisions of a 1982 Pennsylvania abortion law
that in 1986 was rejected by the Supreme Court in a stunning
confirmation of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the nation's most restrictive
abortion bill last year, but Huyett ordered the provisions
temporarily blocked.
   The hearing this week springs from a challenge to the state
bills by Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania, other women's
organizations, and doctors in the state who perform abortions.
   The contested provisions would require married women to inform
their husbands before they can obtain abortions, and generally ban
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.
   Some of the other challenged provisions also were included in
the 1982 bill.
   They include measures to obligate doctors to provide pregnant
women with specified information regarding fetal development and
their rights to obtain child support; require a 24-hour waiting
period between a woman's visit to a doctor and the performance of
the abortion, and force clinics to publicize the names of doctors
who perform abortions and other information.
   Opponents say the law interferes with doctors and invites
harassment of abortion facilities and staff members, while imposing
reproductive choices on women but not on men.
   ``What it does is pose a series of restrictions that put
roadblocks in a woman's ability to have an abortion,'' said Kathryn
Kolbert of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive
Freedom Project.
   Robert R. Gentzel, a spokesman for the attorney general's
office, said the commonwealth believes the bill's restrictions are
permissible under existing Supreme Court rulings.
   Only Guam, in the Pacific, has adopted a more stringent abortion
code than the one passed in Pennsylvania in November. The U.S.
territory's legislature banned all abortions except when a woman's
life is endangered and outlawed all abortion referrals.
   As in Pennsylvania, that law has been temporarily blocked by a
federal court order.
   Stringent anti-abortion measures were passed this year by the
Idaho and Louisiana legislatures, but were vetoed. Louisiana
legislators have threatened to call a special session to override
Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade outlawed
state regulation of abortions unless the regulations were clearly
to safeguard the health of the woman.
   But last year's high court ruling in a Missouri case, Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services, gave greater restrictive power to
state Legislatures.
   The Pennsylvania law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood,
Women's Suburban Clinic, Women's Health Services Inc., Reproductive
Health and Counseling Center, Allentown Women's Center and Dr.
Thomas Allen of Allentown on behalf of all Pennsylvania physicians
who perform or make referrals for abortions.
   The defendants in the suit are Casey, state Secretary of Health
N. Mark Richards and state Attorney General Ernie Preate.

<HEAD>Retarded Man's Family Says He May Have Been Lynched</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives and friends of a retarded man
found naked and hanged from a tree in January say he may have been
lynched, but authorities ruled the death an accident caused by a
deviant sexual practice.
   The body of Tommy Phillips, who had the mental capacity of a
kindergartner, was found outside a group home where he lived. A
sock was stuffed in his mouth and his hands were loosely tied
behind his back.
   Authorities at first ruled the 36-year-old's death a suicide,
but the Department of Public Safety later determined he had died
accidentally because of a sexual game gone awry, The Dallas Morning
News reported Sunday.
   The police report said Phillips rigged the noose to partially
cut off air to the brain and enhance sexual excitement. There have
been previous reports of accidental death from the practice, police
said.
   Staff members at the group home where Phillips lived said he was
incapable of the detailed preparations involved in the hanging.
   They said the report's authors ignored the fact that Phillips
was severely scalded six months earlier by someone who reportedly
threatened to kill him if he talked about it.
   Several employees of the group home said they had received
threatening phone calls after Phillips' death and were told to
leave town. The group home closed in April.
   ``It's absolutely the worst excuse for an investigation that
I've ever seen in my life,'' said Eve Stickney, a supervisor at the
Waxahachie home who found Phillips' body.
   Texas Ranger George Turner said he drew a conclusion of
accidental death the moment he saw the crime photographs.
   ``If I thought somebody had dusted him, then I'd try to dust
them in return,'' Turner said. ``But it's just not that. It is not
a homicide.''
   An independent forensic pathologist hired by The Morning News
said that it would have been almost impossible for Phillips, who
had an IQ of 34, to devise and complete the task.
   ``The only thing that would be more inconceivable would be to
call it a natural death,'' said pathologist Linda Norton.
   Eight current and former state employees who supervised Phillips
at the home said they also are convinced that he was killed. They
said many people in the neighborhood resented the presence of the
group home.
   The scalding Phillips suffered caused severe burns to his back,
legs and genitals, requiring hospitalization for two weeks, the
former employees said. Although Phillips told police a neighbor
attacked him, no arrest was made.

   A single donor's lung, liver, heart, and kidneys
were transplanted into four separate patients over the weekend by
surgeons at Baylor University Medical Center.
   Three of the organ transplants were performed simultaneously
Saturday, and a fourth on Sunday.
   The organs came from an 18-year-old woman who suffered a fatal
head injury in a car crash, said Dr. Peter Alivizatos, leader of
the surgical team that performed the transplants.
   Doctors know nothing more about the woman than that, he said.
   ``The only important thing for us was that this donor really
helped a patient _ for a heart, a lung, a liver and two kidneys,''
Alivizatos said. ``That's a hell of a lot of help for people, that
was more than we would expect.''
   Gene Gilliard of Seneca, S.C., the lung transplant patient, was
in critical but stable condition Sunday, said Baylor spokeswoman
Susan Hall.
   Gilliard's diseased right lung was replaced in a five-hour
operation, Alivizatos said, in the hospital's first lung
transplant. Gilliard suffers from emphysema.
   At the same time, surgeons provided a new liver to 61-year-old
Shim Park of Waco and a new heart to Brenda Strawbridge, 34, of
Tyler.
   Park was listed in fair condition Sunday. Ms. Strawbridge was in
serious but stable condition.
   Michelle Kasin, 23, of Richardson, was given two new kidneys in
the fourth transplant, completed Sunday morning. Kasin was in fair
condition late Sunday.
   At Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, meanwhile, a Corpus
Christi 3-year-old who received a rare double transplant began
breathing on her own, and her condition was upgraded from critical
to serious, doctors said Sunday.
   Tracey Kay Gonzales, who received a new liver and small
intestine during 14 hours of surgery Tuesday, was removed from a
respirator late Friday, according to a statement from the hospital.
   Only two adults have survived small intestine transplants. The
three children who have received small intestines at Children's
Hospital since 1983 all died within a year of their operations.

   OPEC ministers agreed to halt overproduction in
hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil.
   The 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries signed an accord Friday to notch up their target price
immediately to $21 a barrel from $18.
   The cartel set a new production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels
a day for the rest of the year. OPEC members now are producing
about 23.1 million barrels of oil a day, over the ceiling of 22.1
million in effect in the first half of the year.

   The U.S. economy sputtered at an anemic annual
growth rate of 1.2 percent from April through June with virtually
every economic sector exhibiting weakness, the government said.
   The Commerce Department report Friday on the gross national
product _ the country's total output of goods and services _

   GNP growth in the first three months was revised down to a 1.7
percent rate, compared to 1.9 percent previously, while growth from
October through December was cut to a barely perceptible 0.3
percent, far below the 1.1 percent previous estimate.

   The Soviet economy tumbled from January through
June as workers earned more rubles for producing less and paid
higher prices for scarce necessitites, according to statistics
released Sunday.
   The gross national product dropped 1 percent and labor
productivity fell 1.5 percent compared with the first half of 1989.
But the government printed 9 percent more rubles and the average
wage for industrial and service workers shot up from 236 rubles
($407) to 257 rubles ($443), said a first-half economic report
printed in official newspapers.
   Also Sunday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged impatient
Soviet republics not to print their own money, saying it would
damage the ecnonomy.
   Gorbachev, in an appeal transmitted by the Tass news agency,
said he wanted the republics to understand the ``negative
social-economic consequences that could result from breaking the
united monetary system of the country.''
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all
working on plans to print their own money as they press for
complete independence from the Soviet Union. Earlier this month,
the Ukraine included plans for a separate currency in its
declaration of sovereignty.
   
   The price of potatoes, meanwhile, shot up 10 percent, fruit
prices were up 14 percent and vegetable prices increased 9 percent.
Overall, consumers spent 14.2 percent more on basic goods and
services.
   The litany of economic gloom released by Tass and the government
paper Izvestia should have provided few surprises to Soviet
consumers who battle daily with finding food, clothing and other
daily necessities.
   But it indicated that the government so far has been unable to
make progress on correcting some of the economy's major problems.
   ``A definite increase in pay for labor in comparison to the
output of production is continuing, which worsens the situation on
the consumer market,'' Tass reported. ``The output of money
increased.... The buying power of the ruble dropped. The foreign
trade balance remains negative.''
   This year's budget deficit is estimated at about $103 billion.
   The balance of trade also continued to worsen. The value of
exports dropped from $57.6 billion in the first half of last year
to $52.2 billion this year. Meanwhile, imports increased from $61.9
billion to $63.3 billion.
   Exports to countries of COMECON, the Soviet-led economic union
that includes its former East bloc allies, dropped 10.2 percent.
Those countries, most of which threw out hard-line Communist
dictators last year, are trying to reorient their economies away
from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov have pledged to start
putting reforms in place next year that will free the economy from
heavy state control. They have acknowledged that state-controlled
prices will have to be raised.
   But the plans have been met with stiff resistance from more
traditional- minded Communist Party and parliamentary officials, as
well as consumers worried that their standard of living will fall
even further.
   At the same time the government has acknowledged that some of
its plans were ill-conceived. Last month, Yuri D. Maslyukov, the
head of economic planning, said the Supreme Soviet parliament had
been wise to kick back a government plan to raise the price of
bread beginning July 1.
   The reports, citing figures from the State Statistics
Commission, said that while there were no improvements in basic
economic indicators, some decentralization was taking place in the
Soviet economy.
   About 1.3 million people were working in enterprises in which
groups of workers were renting facilities from the government,
rather than working directly in the state economy, they said.
   The number of people working in cooperatives _ small privately
run businesses _ almost doubled and the value of their goods and
services reached $51.7 billion, it said.
   The amount of consumer goods produced in factories retooled from
defense production, meanwhile, increased more than 20 percent, it
said.

   American movies have been such a hit in the
Soviet Union, the movie magazine couldn't have been far behind.
   Movies USA, which gives away 1 million copies a month to
American moviegoers, will be distributed in theaters and video
stores in Leningrad beginning with the September issue. Actor Jack
Nicholson will be on the cover to welcome Soviets to the American
world of movie news.
   Some American business and scientific magazines have begun
Soviet distribution recently, but the Atlanta-based Movies USA is
the first entertainment magazine.
   And even though the Soviets will be reading about movies that
won't get to their theaters for months, magazine officials and
Soviet experts expect the first 10,000 copies to sell quickly.
   ``The magic of American pop culture shouldn't be
underestimated,'' said Thomas Remington, a Soviet media expert at
Emory University.
   Todd Macrae, Movies USA publisher, said the magazine signed a
one-year test agreement with Russkoye Video Association, the Soviet
Union's first independent media company, to distribute the magazine
in five Leningrad theaters and four video stores.
   ``I thought it would be a great idea to test the waters,'' he
said, adding that if the magazine sells well, more copies will be
distributed in October.
   The issues will be in English, with a greeting in Russian in the
first issue. Macrae said he may distribute Russian versions by next
year.
   The idea started with Larry Namer, the founder of the Movietime
cable network who last year created Global Media Alliance, a
company to help media development in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   Namer became a consultant for Russkoye, which set up the first
independent film production company in the Soviet Union and started
the country's first commercial TV station in Leningrad. Namer says
an entertainment magazine was the next logical step.
   ``It just made all the sense in the world to bring that magazine
over there,'' Namer said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
``There's a tremendous amount of people that speak and read and
study English.''
   ``There is, of course, in my country a tremendous interest in
all things American _ fashion, music and especially movies,'' said
Russkoye President Dimitri Rozhdestvensky. ``Perhaps someday we'll
have a Movies USA and Movies USSR.''
   American publishers have been hesitant to sell their magazines
in the Soviet Union because rubles are not convertible to dollars.
   But Business Week began distributing a Russian version in the
Soviet Union this month, and will begin monthly publication in
1991. Omni, a consumer science magazine, began bilingual
publication last fall.
   Soviet magazines and newspapers, including Liternaya Gazeta and
Moscow News, also have begun distribution in the United States. But
Remington said it is too early to say how well it is doing.
   Movies USA will be sold for the ruble equivalent of $1 _ about
enough for the company to recoup its publication and distribution
costs. ``This is not a money-making venture,'' Macrae said.
   But it will be soon, Namer insists, because Western companies
that have re-invested their rubles in the Soviet Union will become
big money-makers if rubles become convertible.
   ``The way we need to look at this is as a culture exchange, a
developmental phase for what will become a very lucrative deal,''
he said. ``It's just like McDonald's _ they're investing their
rubles in building a second store and a third. In five years, when
rubles are convertible and McDonald's has a few hundred stores,
they'll be perfectly positioned for a massive consumer market.
   ``At a smaller scale, so will we.''

<BYLINE>What Will the Baby Food Leader Do After the Baby Boom?

<TEXT>
   The world's largest baby-food company,
Gerber Products Co., says it's getting ready for when the baby boom
goes bust.
   Gerber has new products and selling strategies aimed at
expanding sales beyond the 1-year-old and younger babies who
currently slurp, throw and spit most of its applesauce, strained
carrots and other mushy meals.
   With such a specialized market, Gerber executives keep a close
eye on demographic trends, snatching up indications of how many
babies are born or will be born.
   ``Last year for the first time in 25 years, births topped the 4
million mark,'' Gerber Products Division President Robert L.
Johnston reassured stockholders in the high school auditorium in
Gerber's western Michigan headquarters town of Fremont. ``It isn't
over yet,'' he said at the annual meeting.
   Food industry analyst William McMillin of Prudential Bache
Research in New York, said that for Gerber, ``the test will come
later in the decade when the birth rate slows.''
   Baby boomers aren't having as many children as their parents,
who filled the nurseries with a record 4.3 million new tots in 1957
at the height of the post-World War II boom, said Greg Spencer of
the U.S. Census Bureau in Washington.
   Births have surged recently as many of those children had
children, said Martin O'Connell, head of the bureau's fertility
statistics branch.
   Many baby-boom women put off having babies in the 1970s while
they were in their 20s and busy with college or careers, O'Connell
said.
   By the end of the 1980s, they were in their 30s and decided it
was time to have children if they were going to.
   The boomlet will fade, Spencer said. ``Thousands of baby-boom
women are turning 40 every day. A much smaller number of women are
turning 16.''
   Later in the 1990s, O'Connell said, ``I would say the companies
that prosper will be those dealing with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds.''
   Gerber employs more than 12,400 people, sells baby products in
50 countries and reported $1.14 billion in sales in its last fiscal
year.
   It has no intention of going to its room just because of a burp
in the demographics.
   To start with, said chairman Alfred A. Piergallini, ``Our
strategy is to attempt to dominate the zero- to 4-year-old range.''
   ``Three to 5 and 5 to 10 might be the next alternatives,''
Johnston said.
   Stockholders were told Gerber has ways to ride with the trend:
   _Sell to different ages. High-fiber juice drinks aimed at older
children and adults will be in stores next month. Microwave snacks
like spaghetti and meatballs for children up to 3 hit the shelves
in September.
   They carry the Gerber name, but the Gerber baby is gone from the
label.
   New age groups are fertile ground. Johnston said infant formulas
introduced last year snatched up 3.6 percent of a $1.6 billion
formula market and could nurse that to 5 percent this year.
   The company already has 71.5 percent of the $900-million-a-year
market for traditional baby foods like strained carrots, applesauce
and cereals for babies up to 1. The market for babies up to 3 also
could thrive, Johnston said. ``We feel it is equal to the baby food
market, or about $900 million.''
   _Streamline. Gerber, which makes about 180 baby food products,
has sold some sidelines to raise cash for the basics. It sold 115
day-care centers in May for an undisclosed amount. In the past two
years it has shed a trucking company and furniture and car-seat
making units.
   In March, it cut unprofitable clothing lines such as
low-profit-margin private label sleepwear for older children and
sold three apparel plants. It closed a Canadian baby food plant,
consolidating food making in three U.S. plants, which Johnston said
cut $2 million a year from manufacturing costs.
   _Sell in more countries. Piergallini said sales in Poland
recently topped the $1 million mark. The company anticipates new
business in Hungary and Czechoslovakia and has new ventures under
way in Egypt, Turkey, Greece and Saudi Arabia.
   _Add products. ``Mothers trust us,'' Piergallini said. He said
Gerber will put its brand on bottles, pacifiers, dishes and toys,
and add Gerber clothing to that marketed by its Buster Brown and
Weather Tamer units.

<HEAD>U.S. Cracking Down on International Insider Trading</HEAD>

   Less than 24 hours after Contel Corp. and GTE
Corp. announced a $6 billion merger this month, federal regulators
were in court charging insider trading by a group of overseas
investors.
   In January, even before Rorer Group Inc. sold a large stake to
Rhone-Poulenc SA of France, a court froze the U.S. brokerage
accounts of three foreign firms charged with insider trading during
merger talks.
   Last November, when Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. bid for Combustion
Engineering Inc., the government quickly accused a Liechtenstein
company with making $2.8 million in illegal profits.
   The bad guys in insider trading scams aren't necessarily
Americans. Recent cases show U.S. regulators are cracking down on
foreigners profiting from the notorious activity made famous by
Ivan Boesky in the 1980s.
   Chasing overseas insider trading _ using nonpublic information
to profit from securities trades _ means negotiating a maze of
foreign laws, tangled bureacracies, mystery investors and
clandestine bank accounts, not to mention foreign languages.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has made the process
easier in recent years by signing information exchange agreements
with foreign governments. Countries that winked at insider trading
or didn't consider it a crime in the past now have tough laws.
   ``There's no question that other countries are reacting to the
American experience,'' said Donald Langevoort, a Vanderbilt
University law professor.
   ``Virtually all major capital marketplace countries have
prohibitions on insider trading, but they don't have SECs,'' he
said. ``So you have conduct that's illegal but you don't have
someone there to enforce the law.''
   Japan only recently assigned a prosecutor to its securities
investigations branch. After years protecting its vaunted bank
secrecy, Switzerland has outlawed insider trading and signed a
cooperation treaty with the United States.
   ``Ten years ago if we had a case involving a Swiss bank it was
almost a dead end,'' said a former SEC lawyer now working for a
major Wall Street firm, who asked not to be named.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he wants to ensure U.S.
markets aren't at a competitive disadvantage overseas.
   ``Part of that is assuring that people understand that there
isn't going to be an advantage in going to a Swiss bank or a
Liechtenstein trust to trade in violation of our standards,'' said
John Olson, a Washington securities lawyer.
   The U.S. government can pursue insider trading by foreign
investors as long as trades are made on a U.S. exchange. SEC
investigators scour daily trading records looking for sharp jumps
in trading volume of stocks, especially ones mentioned in takeover
or merger talk.
   If a spike up is apparent _ as it was in the GTE, Rorer and
Combustion Engineering deals _ regulators quickly ask a federal
judge to freeze trading accounts of those suspected of insider
dealings.
   Why? Options trades, which are popular in merger deals because
they give investors the option but not the obligation to buy a
stock within a given time, are cleared by brokerage houses
overnight. Stock transactions take seven days.
   After transactions settle, the money is turned over to
investors. After money is transferred out of the United States,
it's practically irretrievable.
   The SEC has not attempted to get back money after the fact from
defendants overseas. But it is expected to make such an attempt
soon in the case of Eddie Antar, the former Crazy Eddie discount
electronics store chain whom investigators believe squirreled away
millions overseas.
   ``In those cases where we need to protect the assets from being
moved and secreted we have to act quickly,'' said Thomas Newkirk,
the SEC's chief litigation counsel.
   That means seeking an injunction based on the mere suspicion of
illegal behavior. Judges are giving the SEC the benefit of the
doubt by signing orders before receiving hard evidence a run-up in
a stock price is due to insider trading.
   In freezing more than $4 million in two trading accounts in the
Rorer deal, U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram supported the
government's use of circumstantial evidence. ``The sudden and
timely interest these defendants had in Rorer securities is
suspicious and has not been adequately explained,'' she wrote.
   In the Contel-GTE deal, the SEC got a freeze before identifying
the investors accused of making at least $1 million through insider
trading. Last week it named four West Germans, three European
companies and nine Swiss bank employees.
   The judge in that case concluded that there appeared to have
been a leak of information, so he blocked twelve U.S. banks and
securities firms from disposing of Contel stock and options. None
of the banks or firms was charged, but they were forced to
cooperate with investigators and name their customers.
   Brokerage houses often get caught in a jurisdictional tug-of-war
between regulators and customers overseas. Complicating matters,
some investors remain unidentified by trading through banks.
   In a key 1981 case involving insider trading in the takeover of
the mining company Santa Fe International by the Kuwaiti
government, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. had its accounts frozen here and
was sued in Kuwait.
   Chasing insider trading involving foreigners also is expensive
and can be fraught with delays, such as getting Justice Department
clearance, hiring foreign lawyers, getting foreign judges to
approve investigations, securing evidence such as foreign telephone
records and translating sheaths of documents.
   ``We have to try to gain disgorgement of ill-gotten gains or
profits, and that can be a very cumbersome process,'' SEC
Enforcement Director William McLucas said.

   Fraud, lax government regulation and talk of a
taxpayer bailout.
   It sounds like a litany from the savings and loan crisis.
Instead, it is the story of federally guaranteed student loans.
   The two problems cannot be compared in magnitude or severity,
but there are parallels.
   Both speak to the inherent abuses that can occur anytime the
federal government attempts to protect private parties against
risk. Both involve what critics charge is lax government oversight.
   Cracks in the student loan system were underscored last week
when the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, or HEAF, said it
needed federal help to avoid a financial collapse.
   HEAF is the largest of 47 state government and private,
non-profit agencies guaranteeing student loans made by 12,000
commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions and other
lenders.
   Based in Overland Park, Kan., it has guarantees $8.8 billion in
loans, or about 17 percent of the national total of $51 billion.
   Disclosure of HEAF's problems last Monday sent ripples through
the financial markets, contributing to a 105-point plunge in the
stock market during the first 90 minutes of trading.
   At stake is a system that last year lent $12 billion, at
subsidized rates, to 4.7 million students at 8,000 four-year
universities, community colleges and trade schools.
   Bankers say that if the government allows HEAF to default, the
entire student loan program could be jeopardized.
   ``Student loans, if not for the guarantee, would be very risky
and would probably not be made,'' said Floyd Stoner of the American
Bankers Association. ``They are loans to people with no credit
history, no assets and no fixed address.''
   ``If people get nervous, they tend to get more cautious. And the
way you get more cautious as a lender is to make fewer loans,'' he
said.
   Analysts say the market's reaction to HEAF's crisis is evidence
of broader investor concerns about the federal budget deficit,
which is being swelled by the S&amp;L bailout, and the potentially
staggering taxpayer liability for government guarantee programs
benefiting farmers and home buyers, in addition to college students.
   ``The question is: How many of the government funding agencies
will go the way of the thrift funding agency?'' said economist
Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.
   Education Department officials rushed to reassure nervous
lenders, borrowers and investors. They dispatched a team of
auditors to HEAF offices and said they were hoping to avoid a
default by finding another guaranty agency to take it over.
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that following a weekend meeting, Office of Management and
Budget and Education Department officials hoped to resolve the
problem this week.
   ``They (HEAF) have the cash flow to make it for another week,''
the official said. ``The situation is urgent but not so urgent that
we don't have time to sit back and assess our options.''
   Student loan problems affect taxpayers in two ways: directly
through the Education Department and indirectly through Sallie Mae,
the Student Loan Marketing Association.
   The Education Department is budgeted to spend $2 billion this
year on student loan defaults. It reimburses guaranty agencies for
100 percent of the loss for default rates under 5 percent.
Reimbursement drops to 90 percent when the default rate tops 5
percent and to 80 percent when the rate hits 9 percent.
   HEAF is the only guaranty agency to reach the 9 percent default
level this year. Its income from insurance premiums paid by
borrowers has not been enough to make up for the loss of federal
reimbursement.
   But because HEAF's default could scare off all lenders, the
federal government is under great pressure to arrange a takeover,
which will probably require an additional expenditure of taxpayer
dollars.
   Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders told the Senate Banking
Committee on Friday that the ``outside number'' for a bailout would
be $100 million, but he said the department still hoped to arrange
a takeover that would avoid additional federal liability.
   Sanders said five to seven other guaranty agencies are
experiencing difficulty. But none are having as much difficulty as
HEAF, and collectively they are about half as big as HEAF, he said.
   Sallie Mae is a federally chartered, but shareholder-owned
secondary market company that buys student loans from lenders. It
finances about four of every 10 loans.
   In theory, there is no credit risk on its $17.3 billion
portfolio because all of the loans are insured by the guaranty
agencies. But $2.9 billion of the loans are insured by HEAF.
   That's why Sallie Mae stock led the price decline last week. At
the end of trading Friday, it sold for $46.50 a share, off 14
percent from a week earlier.
   Technically, taxpayers aren't at risk from Sallie Mae beyond its
$1 billion line of credit to the U.S. Treasury. But most investors
assume the government would not stand idle if the fortunes of
Sallie Mae, considered the healthiest of the government-sponsored
enterprises, turned sour.
   Congress, shellshocked by the savings and loan crisis, wasted
little time in exploring the causes and laying blame for the
student loan woes.
   ``Once again, it appears that the federal government has
explicitly or implicitly guaranteed risks stemming from the
behavior of financial institutions over which it has little or no
control,'' said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee.
   Administration officials vigorously reject the comparison.
   ``While we take these problems very seriously, analogies of this
situation to the savings and loan crisis are quite simply
inappropriate,'' Sanders said.
   Estimates of the cost of the S&amp;L crisis run to $500 billion, or
$2,000 for every man, woman and child in the nation.
   If every single student loan in the country soured, it would
amount to a $51 billion problem _ and 89 percent of student loans
are in fact sound, according to the General Accounting Office,
Congress' auditing agency.
   Still, the default problem is growing four times as fast as the
loan program. While all student loans increased 83 percent from
1983 to 1989, defaults are up 352 percent over the same six-year
period, according to the GAO.
   HEAF is attributing its problems to its numerous loans to
students attending beauty, truck-driving and other trade schools,
where defaults are highest.
   Critics charge that although many trade schools run good
programs, others are scam operations, existing only to collect
tuition from students who borrow the money and then default. The
default rate hits 90 percent at a handful of the schools.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate education
subcommittee, blames student loan problems on budget cuts during
the Reagan administration.
   No school can participate in a federal aid program unless it is
certified by the Department of Education. However, Pell said, the
department's audits dropped from 1,977 in 1981 to 890 in 1986.
   More fundamentally, he said, loan problems are occurring because
the Reagan and Bush administrations have been using loans as a
substitute for grants.
   ``We began the last decade with the typical student aid package
composed three-fourths of grants and only one-fourth loans. Today,
it is precisely the opposite,'' he said.

   Roger B. Smith, an accountant who drove General
Motors Corp. over some of its roughest roads, retires Tuesday as
chairman, ending a 9{-year tenure criticized for focusing too much
on money and too little on cars.
   Money is among the things Smith bragged about during an
interview two weeks before leaving.
   ``I think the corporation is in super shape,'' he said. ``We
made more money last year than any corporation in the world except
Royal Dutch Shell.
   ``I don't think that's too bad a target.''
   GM reported $4.2 billion in profit for 1989, down 13 percent
from 1988, the best year in company history. In 1981, Smith's first
year as chairman, GM made $333.4 million.
   That's a turnaround of which any accountant, including Smith,
would be proud.
   In 1981, GM's share of the U.S. car market stood at about 46
percent. At the end of last year it was 35.1 percent. Smith, the
third longest-serving GM chairman since 1912, dismisses that when
looking at the big picture of the corporation.
   ``You can't pay dividends out of market share,'' he says.
   That doesn't fly with Herb Adcox, a Chevrolet dealer in
Chattanooga, Tenn. Adcox has been a dealer for 38 years, three
fewer than Smith has been with GM.
   ``I know the shareholders have got to make money, but if the
market share begins slipping, you lose,'' Adcox says.
   Plenty of people think GM lost during Smith's watch.
   Books critical of him and his policies are in book stores. H.
Ross Perot quit the GM board in late 1986 in a highly publicized
fight with Smith over the way the company was managed. GM spent
about $700 million to quiet Perot. That move generated harsh
criticism, especially from GM's main union, the United Auto Workers.
   Most recently, the movie ``Roger and Me'' takes Smith to task
for GM's cutbacks in the company's birthplace of Flint, Mich. Smith
says he hasn't seen the film and doesn't plan to.
   ``I feel good about the situation the company is in with its
products, quality and future,'' he says. ``It makes my going a lot
easier.''
   Smith claims the 1984 corporate reorganization which combined
engineering, manufacturing and marketing of each of its car
divisions into two groups as his greatest accomplishment.
   The execution of that reorganization was another matter,
especially in communications. Smith said he regrets that.
   The acquisitions of Electronic Data Systems Corp. in 1984 from
Perot and Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1986 are proud moments.
   ``If EDS never did a thing for us in terms of working together,
just look at the financial aspects,'' he says. Last Wednesday, EDS
reported its second-quarter earnings rose to $125.3 million, up
19.5 percent from a year ago.
   ``Look at Hughes, 15,000 engineers we picked up there,'' he
said. ``We haven't caught up with that yet. The automobile isn't
quite ready for what they've got. When it gets there, it's going to
be wonderful.''
   For all the criticism leveled at Smith ``the beancounter,'' his
final official act will come from behind the wheel of a car. He
will drive the first Saturn off the line at Spring Hill, Tenn.
   In 1983, Smith announced the project. GM so wanted Saturn to be
separate from the corporation that it set up a subsidiary to
coordinate all activities.
   A new, $1.9 billion manufacturing complex was built in Spring
Hill.
   Such a ceremony at GM typically is rife with publicity, but
Saturn isn't the typical GM manufacturing plant. Smith's turn at
the wheel would be a private affair.
   There had been speculation that Saturn officials were worried
that pictures of Smith mugging for cameras from the driver's seat
may conjure up thoughts that Saturn isn't really that distinctive
from other GM cars.
   All during the 1980s, GM heard criticism that all its cars
looked essentially the same. ``Oldsmobuicks'' and ``Chevymobiles''
were among the nicknames.
   Industry observers say that should fade under new Chairman
Robert Stempel, who takes over Wednesday. Smith rose through GM's
financial ranks. Stempel, GM's president for nearly three years,
came up through its engineering and marketing organizations. The
two have had adjoining offices and have worked closely.
   The switch in GM's leadership has received rave reviews.
   ``I will never sell GM short,'' says auto analyst Mary Anne
Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``When that
elephant learns to dance, and it's learning some of the steps, you
have a very formidable powerhouse in there.''
   Smith may or may not be missed. But he will miss GM.
   ``I've been running the thing for 10 years,'' said Smith, the
third of four children born to a Columbus, Ohio, banker and his
wife. ``I'm going to miss that, I'll tell you for sure.''
   Smith plans to dabble in commercial real estate.
   ``There's a guy where I keep my boat up north who wants to build
a boat storage building that doesn't have the capital. I can help
him,'' said Smith, who will pull in about $1.2 million in pension a
year. He also will be paid to remain on GM's board.
   Smith said Stempel can have the physical demands of the
chairmanship.
   ``There's a lot of nights that you get home at 2 o'clock in the
morning and you come in here at 6,'' he says. ``I'm not going to
miss that.''

<HEAD>Ms. Magazine Back on Newstands With First Ad-Free Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also in AMs report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight months after suspending publication, Ms.
magazine is headed back to the newsstand without advertising but
with an avowed mission of unashamed feminism.
   The magazine also has a slightly new name, Ms.: The World of
Women, which its backers say better reflects its worldwide scope.
   The first issue of the redesigned magazine goes on sale Monday
for $4.50 a copy at newstands and through the Waldenbooks and B.
Dalton bookstore chains.
   Subscriptions are priced at $40 a year for six issues that will
appear every other month.
   The cover of the first issue shows a tiny globe nestled between
two women's hands. ``Collector's edition,'' it says across the top.
``No advertising, editorially free. Ms. Lives.''
   But it is not entirely accurate to say it has no advertising.
There are six ads displayed on the inside cover under the heading
``No Comment,'' a feature that Ms. editors formerly used to
showcase examples of bad or sexist ads.
   This time, four of the ads were culled from the pages of the old
Ms. magazine while two others are ads in which Ms. touted itself to
advertisers in trade publications.
   One of the trade ads showed a woman wearing a dress made of $10
bills below the heading ``What do you call a woman with serious
money to invest? Ms.''
   The other trade ad shows several photos tracing the evolution of
a young woman from someone with straight-hair and a headband to a
glamour-puss. ``We're not the Ms. we used to be,'' the ad said.
   The 17-year-old Ms. suspended publication after the November
1989 issue. Its new owner, Dale Lang, said the magazine was losing
substantial sums of money and he was persuaded to reshape it,
banning paid ads and trying to survive on circulation revenue alone.
   Lang, who also publishes Working Woman, Working Mother, Sassy
and Success magazines, more than doubled the previous $16 a year
subscription rate and reduced the number of issues from 10 a year.
   But he felt there was enough interest in serious examination of
feminist issues and writing that the magazine could break even on
circulation alone.
   Lang spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said the magazine can get by with
less than 100,000 circulation. It had been guaranteeing advertisers
550,000 circulation.
   Industry analysts have expressed doubts about the magazine's
chances for survival without advertising. They say the relatively
high price will discourage some readers, and that the topics Ms.
made its reputation on are now covered adequately in other mass
magazines.
   Robin Morgan, a novelist, journalist and feminist activist who
has been hired as the editor of Ms., said there is an audience for
the magazine.
   ``Because the world is shrinking and the women's movement is
growing, this Ms. will be international and unabashedly feminist,''
she wrote in a letter to readers.
   The magazine has a report by Ms. co-founder Gloria Steinem on
advertising and magazines, called ``Sex, Lies &amp; Advertising.''
   Also in the issue is a report on women of Eastern Europe, an
essay from former Rep. Bella Abzug on widowhood and a conversation
between country singer k.d. lang and pop singer Lesley Gore.
   It also contains poetry by Toni Morrison and Adrienne Rich, an
essay by Marilyn French, book, music and film reviews and regular
sections on international news stories, a photo essay and
ecofeminism.
