   Earl Wild celebrated his 75th birthday and lots
of people came. Wild strode onto the Carnegie Hall stage and gave a
magnificent piano recital on Monday night, the 75th anniversary of
his birth in Pittsburgh.
   A few days before his birthday, Wild said he'd always been known
as having expert technique and these days he is thinking about the
music more.
   He began Monday night with Beethoven's ``32 Variations on an
Original Theme,'' differentiating the variations with a tiny pause
between each.
   Then he played Chopin's four ``Ballades,'' chosen because
they're serious pieces that he has lived with all his life and
still is trying to project better. These ``Ballades'' aren't
program music. But it's easy for a listener to visualize being in a
beautiful maze garden, turning corners and seeing something quite
different as Chopin moves between power and delicacy.
   After intermission, Wild played Liszt's ``Funerailles,'' moving
and somehow uplifting, with none of Liszt's well-known bravura,
plus two concert etudes and ``Rhapsodie Espagnole.''
   Wild composes and makes transcriptions for piano which he
considers virtuoso etudes. He played three transcriptions as
encores, ``Floods of Spring'' by Rachmaninoff, ``Pas de Quatre''
from Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' and Gershwin's ``I Got Rhythm.''
Pianist Billy Taylor was seen in the audience smiling broadly
during the last one.
   Wild received a standing ovation, two bouquets and a cake
wheeled out from the wings.
   He was 14, in 1929, when first engaged by Otto Klemperer as
pianist for the Pittsburgh Symphony. Trying to build a career
during the Depression, his first job was making orchestrations. In
1936 he got hired as staff pianist at NBC. In 1939 he gave the
first piano recital on American TV. In 1942, when Toscanini decided
to conduct his first ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' he chose Wild, who'd
never played it either, as his soloist. Wild was immediately hailed
as a Gershwin expert.
   He taught at the Juilliard School for 10 years and now is
distinguished artist-in-residence at Ohio State University.

<TEXT>
   The familiar rugged faces and slight
builds of the Yemenis, once conspicuous in markets across Saudi
Arabia, are slowly disappearing as a result of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Instead, Egyptians are showing up in larger numbers, along with
more Indians and Pakistanis in a gradual transformation of the
lower echelons of the kingdom's labor force.
   The unique position of up to 2 million Yemenis disintegrated
after their government supported Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia retaliated by ending the work and trade privileges
which the Yemenis alone enjoyed among scores of other Third World
communities, primarily because of the common Saudi-Yemeni border.
About half of the Yemenis have already returned home.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, on the other hand, has led the
cry against Saddam Hussein from the start of the invasion, and his
Egyptian work force is reaping the benefit.
   Informed sources here expect the Egyptian labor force, already
estimated at 750,000, to grow by thousands as the Yemenis depart.
   One diplomatic source noted that several large companies plan to
hire Egyptians and have applied to the Interior Ministry for work
visas.
   ``We've even heard that Egyptian workers whose contracts were
renewed in September received generous raises in salary,'' said one
informed source. ``It was the private sector showing their
appreciation for Egypt's stand.''
   The Yemenis' departure has already left some scars, albeit
temporary. A trip down Riyadh's Wazira Street reveals scores of
empty storefronts, the interiors nothing but rubble and a few
remnants of goods sold in haste.
   ``A Yemeni man used to deliver my newspaper every morning,''
said one executive. ``I haven't seen him for two months. Tomorrow,
he's being replaced by a Pakistani.''
   Some complain that the Yemeni bakers, known for their delicious
Arabic bread, will be sorely missed and impossible to replace.
``Thank goodness the baker I go to is still here,'' said one
expatriate.
   Although the move against Yemen was an angry response to Yemen
President Ali Abdullah Saleh's alignment with Saddam, diplomatic
sources in Riyadh said the decision probably made sense regardless
of politics.
   ``To have 10 percent of your total population running around
without documentation just seems silly,'' said one diplomat. ``It
was silly before the invasion, but it was really brought home to
them after Aug. 2.''
   The authorities had simply decreed that Yemen nationals,
previously allowed to work in Saudi Arabia without formal
sponsorship, would be treated like everyone else.
   Except the timing of the measure meant many Saudis would not
sponsor them.
   The majority of Yemenis in Saudi Arabia were shop owners and
vendors, semi-skilled and unskilled laborers. Many were mechanics,
bakers, merchants, porters, car washers and tea boys.
   The effect of the new rules on Saudi Arabia's economy has been
minimal. A former Saudi government advisor noted: ``There's a lot
of underemployment here anyway and the Yemenis contributed to that.
I don't think there will be major repercussions from their loss. In
fact, I think there will be some benefit.''
   Businesses previously in competition with Yemeni merchants would
now prosper, he said.
   A diplomat, however, pointed out that Saudi Arabia may feel the
loss of Yemeni spending power. While the average Yemeni salary is
700 riyals (the equivalent of $186) monthly, Yemenis do not remit
the greater part of their salaries back home.
   ``Most of the expatriates can't bring their families with them,
but the Yemenis can,'' said the diplomat. ``So they don't send as
much money home. It's an important demographic difference - most of
the money they earn goes back into the Saudi economy.''
   Sources estimate that approximately 1 million Yemenis will
remain in Saudi Arabia under official sponsorship. Few expect that
number to increase when the Persian Gulf crisis is over.
   ``I wouldn't like my government to give equal opportunity to
those who did not stand with us,'' said the chief operating officer
of a major company.

<HEAD>City's Last Family Farm Hangs on in Queens</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

   John Klein weeds a row of beets and white
radishes with a turn-of-the-century, wood-and-iron push hoe.
Nearby, tall zucchini plants sprout limp yellow blossoms. His
mother, Barbara, sells corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and fruit to
passers-by from a stand on the street.
   This is New York City's last family farm, two green acres in the
Fresh Meadows section of Queens, surrounded by small brick
apartment houses, an elementary school, paved ball court, and a
broad street noisy with buses and traffic from nearby expressways.
   ``A couple of weeks ago, these guys from Florida got off the
Clearview Expressway and came down the street asking directions,
and they couldn't believe there was a farm in the middle of Queens.
They thought they were in the Twilight Zone,'' said Klein, 25, a
fourth-generation farmer.
   The two acres - slightly bigger than a square city block, with a
chain-link fence on three sides and a lawn and tall oaks in front -
are all that's left of a 100-acre spread that was sold off piece by
piece over the years.
   The Kleins grow beets, carrots, scallions, radishes, basil,
dill, parsley, cucumbers, squash, and kohlrabies - ``stuff that
doesn't need that much room to grow,'' Klein explained.
   The rows are so short, he has to weed them by hand. ``It's too
small to use a tractor,'' he said. ``By the time you got there,
you'd have to turn it around.''
   But the family also grows corn, melons and produce that needs
more space on 100 acres in Riverhead, on Long Island's eastern tip.
It's trucked in each day to the farm stand.
   Open July to November, seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
the farm stand on 195th Street and 73rd Avenue does a brisk
business.
   ``In Queens, to find a farmer's market, this is really an
oasis,'' said Sylvia Ehrlich as she examined tomatoes.
   ``I come here all the time - the stuff is delicious,'' agreed
Michael Morache, who was buying zucchinis.
   Freshness is key. ``I go out and pick it in the morning and by
the end of the day, it's home in their refrigerator,'' said Klein.
``We run out and pick the basil and dill and parsley right away for
people because if you leave it out for a half-hour, it gets
wilted.''
   His great-grandfather, Adam, began farming in Fresh Meadows in
the 1890s. His great-aunts, Margaret and Stella, live in two brick
houses on the remaining two acres.
   Why keep the Queens land, when the family owns 100 acres in
Riverhead?
   ``It's definitely a tradition, but it's making a living also,''
said Klein. ``If you go out to Riverhead, on every corner there's a
farmstand. But we're the last ones here.''
   Certainly Queens is better known as home to the Mets, Archie
Bunker and 2 million of the city's 7.5 million residents than as an
agricultural community.
   But Queens, like the four other boroughs, has a rich farming
past dating to the 1600s. Only in the 1800s did industry and
housing begin to replace open space around the city. Narrow,
winding streets in Lower Manhattan recall cowpaths. Bleecker Street
in Greenwich Village harks back to the Bleecker Farm of colonial
times. In the 1830s, trains chugged ``through miles of rocky
wasteland overrun by pigs and goats'' from what is now Little Italy
up to Harlem, according to the Works Progress Administration Guide
to New York City.
   Small farms - called truck farms because their produce was
trucked into urbanized areas to be sold - remained common in
Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx until after World War
II, when developers gobbled up land to build housing.
   Henry Ludder, the Queens borough historian, recalled cutting
across vegetable fields as he walked home from school in Bayside,
Queens, in the early 1940s. ``I can remember pulling a carrot or a
beet out of the ground, rubbing the dirt off on my pants and
chewing it as I went along,'' he said.
   About 20 farmhouses dating from 1679 through 1871 around the
city are designated landmarks; most are owned by historical
societies. Two - the Queens County Farm Museum in Floral Park, and
the Decker Farm, owned by the Staten Island Historical Society -
remain working farms.
   But the Klein enterprise is the last family owned farm within
city limits. Even the Klein farm in Riverhead is one of a vanishing
breed.
   ``I imagine another 25 years, Riverhead will be like here, and
you'll be out there writing about the last farm,'' said Klein's
father, also John, 47.
   After Adam Klein sold most of the Queens property, he bought
farmland in Hicksville, Long Island, and then was pushed out
further east to Melville, and again out to Riverhead.
   ``I guess we can't go too much further or else we'll be in the
ocean,'' said the younger Klein.
   ``There's no farms in Hicksville now and there's only four or
five farms left out in Melville and property is worth a million
dollars an acre out there, so the guys holding it are just dumb,''
his father said.
   Would he consider selling the two acres in Queens?
   ``If I didn't want to farm anymore, I'd just plant it with
grass, put a big swimming pool in the back,'' he said. ``If you
don't have to sell it, why sell it?''

<HEAD>Antique-Loving Teachers Add One-Room Schoolhouse to Collection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMERALD, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two antique-loving teachers are making a
major addition to their collection - a historic one-room
schoolhouse.
   The 96-year-old Lane School must be moved 21 miles to their
farm, where Tom Lutzi and his wife, Judy, plan to fix it up.
   ``One-room schoolhouses are kind of like dinosaurs; they'll be
extinct before too long,'' Lutzi said. ``We wanted to save one. You
almost have to be a teacher to appreciate it.''
   Lutzi and his wife, both second-generation teachers, intend to
outfit the schoolhouse with a stove, school bell, desks and slate
chalkboards to re-create the classroom as it was when it opened
nearly 100 years ago.
   Lane School was built in 1894, said 82-year-old Leo Taylor, who
attended classes at the first- through eighth-grade schoolhouse and
later taught there for five years. It closed in 1962.
   As many as 2,000 pupils attended the school during its 68 years
of operation, Taylor said.
   It won't be the first building the Lutzis have saved. Years ago,
they moved an old gas station 35 miles to their farm in
southeastern Nebraska. Lutzi said he also has bought a
Depression-era outhouse to be placed close to the school.

<HEAD>Deficit-Cutting Lawmakers Know: Keep Your Hands Off Social
Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers looking for ways to trim the federal
deficit can cut defense spending and even raise taxes if they have
to. But they have found they'd better not touch Social Security.
   This year, Social Security will dispense about $265 billion -
more than one-fifth of all federal spending. But the program was
untouched in the deficit-reduction package enacted last month.
   And new budget rules make Social Security virtually untouchable
in the future.
   The reason has much to do with the political power of the
elderly, but also with the program's overall popularity, analysts
and lawmakers say.
   ``It's a real gut issue,'' said Sen. John D. Rockefeller,
D-W.Va.
   Both Social Security and Medicare, the health care program for
the elderly, are ``enormously popular programs,'' noted Henry
Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
``The public opinion polls indicate that people would prefer to cut
the deficit in any other way.''
   That explains why, as lawmakers were voting billions of dollars
in new taxes and defense cuts to cut the budget deficit last month,
Social Security recipients being were told their benefits would
increase 5.4 percent in January.
   The Bush administration announced this month it was looking at
ways to shift government benefits from the wealthy to the poor, but
it specifically excluded Social Security.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., noted that ``members of Congress are
still pretty sensitive'' after having to repeal the Medicare
catastrophic illness program last year after an outcry by senior
citizens who didn't want to pay for it. The program was designed to
protect the elderly from financial ruin if they were struck by a
devastating illness.
   A fight over Medicare cuts was one issue that delayed last
month's budget agreement. In the final version, Medicare takes a
$42 billion hit over five years. About $10 billion of that comes
from beneficiaries' pockets.
   Social Security and Medicare are widely considered the most
effective government programs ever to improve the lives of senior
citizens.
   A 1988 Census Bureau report said Social Security benefits lifted
15 million elderly citizens out of poverty in 1986 and cut the
poverty rate among the elderly from 47 percent to 14 percent.
   ``It's done a fantastic job of reducing poverty among the
elderly,'' said Robert Ball, former Social Security commissioner.
``About two thirds of beneficiaries get more than half their income
from Social Security.''
   Social Security and the hospital part of the Medicare program
are funded in the same way - with a payroll tax held in a trust
fund earmarked solely for that program.
   Neither program is run like welfare; benefits are given to rich
and poor alike. Rather, the criteria are related to age or
disability, plus a person's lifetime contributions to the program.
   ``It's precisely the fact that they're not programs for the poor
that gives these programs their unifying force,'' said Gary
Burtless, a senior fellow at Brookings.
   ``People think they have paid and now they're entitled'' to
benefits, Aaron said.
   Judy Schub, senior economic lobbyist at the American Association
of Retired Persons, said the elderly tend to think of their Social
Security benefits as money that was put away for them, ``that
there's a piggy bank with my name on it.''
   However, the system is an inter-generational plan, with today's
recipients receiving far more than they ever paid into the system.
Current workers are paying those benefits.
   After financial troubles in the early 1980s, Social Security
benefits were scaled back in 1983 and other changes were made to
keep its trust fund solvent.
   Now there's a large surplus, and Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
tried this year to reduce the Social Security payroll tax so that
money from the program would not grow so quickly and be used to
mask the size of the federal budget deficit.
   His effort was unsuccessful, but others in Congress did succeed
in removing the program from the calculations used to determine the
federal deficit. That means that cutting Social Security won't help
the deficit.
   Medicare, however, is facing mounting pressure, as inflation in
medical costs continues to outpace overall inflation. The reserves
in the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund are shrinking and the
fund faces bankruptcy in 13 to 15 years unless action is taken,
according to the 1990 annual report of the program's Board of
Trustees.
   Ball said he is mindful of Social Security's popularity and the
political risk in touching it.
   ``Changes should be made in Social Security from time to time
... to bring it up to date and make it a better program,'' said
Ball, a member of the Social Security Advisory Committee at the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   But, he said, ``The changes should be made for sound Social
Security policy, not to reduce the deficit.''

   Critics of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, arch-foe of
federal spending on ``obscene art,'' hooted with glee over rumors
that the conservative California Republican had written a movie
script ablaze with steamy love scenes.
   But Rohrabacher is having the last laugh. He says he's on the
brink of signing a deal with Hollywood producers to film his
screenplay, ``The French Doctoresse,'' a World War II drama of
romance and intrigue that he predicts will earn nothing worse than
a PG rating.
   ``There's not a single bedroom scene, or people not wearing any
clothes,'' he said. ``It's something the whole family could see. I
think it's going to be the `Dr. Zhivago' of the 1990s.''
   Rohrabacher is a bearded, 43-year-old bachelor, surfing
enthusiast and former newspaperman who was a speech writer for
President Reagan until he won election to the House in 1988 with a
campaign boost from White House buddy Oliver L. North.
   In the House, where he represents a staunchly conservative
coastal district south of Los Angeles, Rohrabacher quickly became
the scourge of the National Endowment for the Arts, which he
accuses of financing pornography and sacrilegious works.
   Rohrabacher said he sold everything he owned, except for his car
and his typewriter, to finish ``The French Doctoresse'' in the late
1970s, and was reduced to sleeping on his brother's living room
sofa.
   As poor as he was, Rohrabacher said, he never once contemplated
applying for a federal grant. Besides, he said, his script was much
too tame to interest the arts endowment.
   ``Who knows what kind of steamy sex scenes would be required for
me to get an NEA grant?'' he said with a chuckle.
   His screenplay is based on the real-life story of Jeanne
Varagnat, a wealthy, red-haired, divorced French physician who
falls in love with a handsome young French fighter pilot named John
Fontaine.
   Madame Varagnat spends the war years trying to win the release
of her lover, who is captured and eventually executed by the
Germans. After the war, she is imprisoned on charges of
collaborating with the Nazis, but she is acqitted at her trial
when she proves she was not a traitor but a spy for the French
Resistance.
   Rohrabacher's screenplay reads more like a Harlequin romance
written for the ``Care Bears'' crowd. Even a PG rating might be
overreacting.
   Rohrabacher's story has the lovers meeting on a skiing vacation.
The pilot has taken a tumble on the slopes. Cut to the resort's
infirmary.
   ``As Jeanne waits for John to regain consciousness, she can't
help noticing his handsome features and rugged, virile body. ...''
   ``A whirlwind romance ensues. The couple take sleigh rides
through the snow; many nights are spent in front of a fireplace.
Against the majesty of the French Alps, they kiss as they ride a
ski lift.''
   Midnight is tolled at a New Year's Eve party, and ``the lovers
kiss as 1940 explodes into reality around them.'' They enjoy a
picnic in the countryside. ``The food and wine are consumed with
gusto, and the two lovers embrace under the shady branches.''
   That's about as hot as it gets. There isn't enough steam to take
the Marine Corps crease out of Ollie North's trousers.
   Rohrabacher envisions Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep or even Jane
Fonda playing the ``older woman,'' and said the young lover's role
should go to a ``Mel Gibson with a French accent.''
   But Rohrabacher warns that once a deal is signed, Hollywood
producers will be free to write sex or violence into the final
script to enhance the movie's box-office appeal.
   The congressman said he wouldn't object if the R-rated material
improved the plot and wasn't merely exploitative. In any event, he
would have little say in the matter.
   ``If they want to make it steamy, they can do it. They own it,''
he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congressional Staff Shows High Turnover, Low Pay</HEAD>

   Many scholars and commentators speculate on
why Congress does what it does, with explanations ranging from
partisan theology to personal avarice to group psychology.
   Fewer have tried to explain, however, why Congress does what it
does as poorly as it often does. But a new survey by the
Congressional Management Foundation offers some insight with a look
into the inner workings of House members' offices.
   The picture that emerges is not one of an elite cadre of public
policy experts as voters might expect. Instead, it's a revolving
door where some offices must have higher turnover than fast-food
restaurants.
   ``Work in Congress has become a stepping stone for the young and
restless rather than a career for the dedicated and experienced,''
said Rick Shapiro, executive director of the foundation and a
coauthor of the study.
   The foundation, which tries to instill professional management
practices in lawmakers, found data that make Shapiro's statement
seem quite mild.
   For example, 52 percent of House legislative assistants, the
people who tackle specific issues for the members and recommend
solutions, have been at their jobs less than one year. Nearly 40
percent of their bosses - the legislative directors - are in the
same category.
   A congressman's top aide is called an administrative assistant.
This is the person who oversees everything, is the keeper of the
body, the equivalent of the president's chief of staff.
   Amazingly, nearly a third of these people have been on the job
less than a year.
   And all House staffers have held their jobs for 15 percent less
time than they did in 1987.
   ``It means that members of the House are generally receiving
essential advice and support from staff who have considerably less
experience than the staff they worked with just three years ago,''
Shapiro said.
   To put it more bluntly, there are a lot of people on Capitol
Hill tinkering with the nation's laws who may not know what they're
doing - and it's not just the people who are elected.
   The foundation points to salaries as one explanation for the
rapid turnover. The average House employee makes $29,542, more than
$2,000 less than the average federal worker and $11,000 less than
private sector earners.
   This statistic is misleading, however, since so many House
employees are so young. The average administrative assistant is 38;
the average legislative assistant is 26.
   Senior staffers in Congress are quite well paid. The average
administrative assistant gets nearly $63,000, and more than 10
percent are above $80,000. Some of them can - and do - turn around
and double or triple their salaries by signing on with lobbying
firms.
   All of this suggests that legislative competence is getting
short shrift in congressional offices. Just think back to this
year's budget-making mangle, and it's hard to argue with that
conclusion.
   So where are congressmen putting their priorities? Toward
getting re-elected, of course.
   This year's elections showed once again that big, national
issues weren't the downfall of very many lawmakers. Perhaps that's
because the built-in advantages of incumbency are nurtured by the
members.
   The biggest pay raises handed out in congressional offices over
the past three years, totaling 18.8 percent, went to press
secretaries, the men and women who make sure their bosses get good
coverage in hometown newspapers and local television programs.
   Another reason members are rarely kicked out of Congress is
because of the favors they do for the folks back home.
   Next to the press people, the directors of the lawmakers' home
district offices had the biggest salary boosts, at 18.3 percent
over three years. They also had more job stability than any other
type of congressional office employee, with an average of 5.5 years
in the position.
   Right after them in tenure - with an average 4.7 years - were
the caseworkers, the folks who can help straighten out a citizen's
problem with Social Security or a businessman's beef with the Small
Business Administration.
   These are the kind of favors that challengers can only dream of
delivering to voters.
   Challengers might be more successful if they could convince
voters that those services would continue no matter who holds the
jobs, while the issues they are voting on are getting less and less
expert attention.

   Better times have helped ease loan pressures
on the Farmers Home Administration, but a backlog of hard-luck
cases has sharply boosted foreclosure actions by the agency.
   In the 1990 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the FmHA tallied
50,803 loan applications, down 13 percent from 58,539 in 1989,
according to a year-end report.
   Overall, the FmHA - traditionally called the government's farm
lender of last resort - had a farm loan portfolio of about $24
billion among 210,458 active borrowers. Of those, 31,925 were
behind in their payments as of Sept. 30.
   A year earlier, when there were 230,013 loans outstanding,
41,213 were in arrears, an 18 percent delinquency rate.
   The FmHA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, makes loans
to farmers and others who can't qualify at banks and other
commercial lenders. The agency's total portfolio, including farm,
rural housing and other programs is around $57.5 billion.
   Marlyn Aycock, an agency spokesman, said the loan decline is
attributable to ``what's happened in the farm economy, generally''
over the last few years.
   According to USDA economists, cash farm income nationally in
1990 is expected to be at a record level, probably in the range of
$59 billion to $63 billion, up from $55 billion in 1989.
   That is the money left over in a calendar year from gross cash
income after paying cash expenses, according to USDA analysts. The
previous high was $58.4 billion in 1988.
   But the mills grind slowly in FmHA, and thousands of farmers are
still being affected by the financial crunch of the early and
mid-1980s when debt loads forced thousands into restructuring loans
and, for some, into foreclosure proceedings.
   The number of potential foreclosures is indicated by
``acceleration'' letters sent to delinquent borrowers, a major step
toward final closeout of an FmHA loan through foreclosure.
   Another step is the number of accelerated cases referred to USDA
lawyers to await formal foreclosure action by the government.
   Last fiscal year, according to the report, 5,462 acceleration
letters were sent out, representing 2.6 percent of all farm
borrowers. In the previous year, notices went t 4,045 borrowers,
or 1.8 percent.
   Aycock said bankruptcy petitions and the number of FmHA
delinquency cases sent to the department's Office of General
Counsel for foreclosure action also have increased.
   ``It means that we're working through the old backlog, and more
and more of these cases are getting closer to a conclusion,'' he
said.
   Foreclosures aren't the only way FmHA can collect what is owed,
nor are foreclosures the only reasons farmers go out of business.
   Pressure by the agency can result in the sale of property, in
which case the debt is often settled, or in the voluntary transfer
of property to FmHA as part of a settlement deal.
   According to the annual report, there were 2,505 FmHA borrowers
who left farming ``due to financial difficulties'' in the 1990
fiscal year, representing 1.2 percent of the total number of farm
borrowers.
   In 1989, only 2,066 left farming due to financial difficulties,
representing 0.9 percent of 1989 borrowers.
   Actual foreclosure actions completed by FmHA last year totaled
243 against only 45 in 1989. In addition, there were 179
foreclosure actions completed by banks and other lienholders that
share loans with the agency, compared with 258 in 1989.
   Eight states accounted for three-fourths of last year's FmHA
foreclosures: Alabama, 18; Georgia, 18; Minnesota, 26; Mississippi,
12; Missouri, 28; North Carolina, 29; South Dakota, 17; and Texas,
35.
   Meanwhile, the FmHA has written off in one way or another nearly
40 percent of $8.8 billion in overdue loan payments.
   The forgivenesses stem from the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987,
which allowed write-down and write-off of debts in cases where
collection costs would exceed the recovery value. Some borrowers,
working with FmHA, also are allowed to ``buy out'' their loans at
current liquidation rates.
   Aycock said that as of September, the buyouts of 6,774 loans
showed net losses totaling $1.46 billion. Write-downs of 6,580
totaled $1.02 billion.
   In addition, about $1 billion in old debts, some going back 10
years or more, have been written off completely as uncollectable.

   Mercenary ``killer wasps'' are being deployed in
a battle to rescue besieged cabbage, broccoli and other vegetables
without resorting to chemical pesticide warfare.
   Scientists say the wasps cost about the same as pesticides but
attack pests on parts of plants that chemical sprays don't reach
and can eliminate crop-eating bugs that have developed immunities
to insecticides.
   The wasps also are choosy about their victims. They do not sting
humans or animals.
   Wasps released two weeks ago in the Rio Grande Valley naturally
seek out the larvae of the diamond-back moth and lay eggs inside
them, ensuring their destruction.
   ``Our research has shown that the wasps can provid  a new way to
reduce insect damage to cabbage, broccoli and other vegetables
without using insecticides,'' said entomologist K. Duane Biever of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   In previous tests, Biever found only 5 percent pest damage to
broccoli fields after releasing 300 to 600 pairs of wasps per acre.
In fields without the wasps, 25 percent of the crops were damaged.
   The strain of wasps was developed at a USDA laboratory in
Washington and bred commercially at a private laboratory in Sinton,
a town north of Corpus Christi.

   AIDS is no laughing matter at the Safer Sex
Boutique, but the unique shop offers such lighthearted gifts as
condom-shaped candy and boxer shorts adorned with smiling condom
cartoons that glow in the dark.
   Shoppers also can buy earrings and key chains that discreetly
store condoms inside, or use a computer that calculates a person's
likelihood of exposure to AIDS.
   The unusual store, open this holiday season, is a commercial
experiment to market both silly and serious products that promote
safe sex and draw attention to the needs of those who have acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``This is designed to talk about and promote safer sex by making
it more fun and exciting,'' said Dave Rompa, executive director of
the AIDS Support Network in Madison, an advocacy group that helped
develop the business.
   ``Some stores will have a safe-sex corner or cute little condom
section, but there's never been a whole store devoted to it,'' he
said.
   Since the boutique opened Nov. 5, it has drawn about 2,000
people - both shoppers and the simply curious - ranging from
teen-agers and their parents to divorcees returning to the dating
scene, Rompa said.
   In addition to shelves of books, magazines and videotapes about
the dangers of AIDS and ways to minimize exposure, the store sells
cards containing condoms, comic books promoting and explaining
their use and T-shirts urging contraceptive use because it's
``condom sense.''
   There are also pink-and-black boxer shorts dotted with pictures
of smiling condoms that glow in the dark.
   ``Condom-shaped chocolate mints and glow-in-the-dark condoms are
also big sellers,'' Rompa said.
   The store was funded through donations and fund raising by the
support group, Rompa said. Many of the products were donated by
manufacturers and merchants throughout the United States, Great
Britain and Canada, he said.
   Rompa declined to say how much money the store has earned. It is
staffed by volunteers and all profits are returned to the group.
   The shop will close Dec. 31, but Rompa said the group seeks more
funding and hopes to reopen next year.
   ``If people take safe sex seriously, it could be an ongoing
business,'' Rompa said. ``We opened now for two months because
these are the best shopping months and we're providing products
that are outreach, educational and practical.''
   The store sells several types of condoms - barriers against
sexually-transmitted diseases such as AIDS - anti-bacterial soaps
and other products designed to halt the spread of the incurable
virus.
   It also features a computer that estimates a person's risk of
exposure to AIDS based on their sexual practices and another that
describes possible treatments for those stricken with the fatal
virus.
   ``We have a huge number of parents coming in and young people -
high school-age - who want to know more because they aren't sure
what safer sex was all about,'' Rompa said.

   Promises have been made a year after
Africans braved tear gas and gunfire to shout for democracy in more
than a dozen capitals, but not a single one-party government has
been unseated.
   Fifteen regimes have said they would accept multiparty rule, but
there is no sign that democratically elected administrations will
replace any of them soon.
   Leaders who could not crush protest movements with troops and
arrests have turned to delaying tactics. While paying lip service
to democracy with promises of free elections, critics say, they use
a bag of dirty tricks to stay in power.
   Those who mimicked the communist system and told their people to
look there for inspiration were taken at their word when East
Europeans started demanding freedom.
   After the collapse of Communist parties in the Soviet bloc, the
writing was on the wall for Africa's one-party governments. Western
nations that helped corrupt leaders, in order to keep them from the
Soviet orbit, found it difficult to justify more support.
   ``There is no true development without genuine democracy,''
Jacques Pelletier, the French minister in charge of relations with
Africa, said recently.
   France is a staunch advocate of aid to Third World countries,
but Pelletier's comments echoed those of African opposition
leaders, not governments.
   At a conference on Africa, Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for African affairs, said governments that
resisted their people's demands for democracy would find themselves
``in an increasingly disadvantageous position'' in the competition
for aid.
   Bans on opposition parties have been lifted in six countries:
Benin, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Sao Tome and Zaire.
   Nine have agreed to move toward ending one-party government, but
opposition parties are not yet operating. They are Angola,
Cameroon, Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia
and Zambia.
   The first show of unrest came from Benin, where protesters
stoned a statue of Lenin. They blamed the nation's bankruptcy on
the Marxist-Leninist ideology adopted by President Mathieu Kerekou,
who gained power in a coup, and demanded his resignation.
   Kerekou renounced communism in response and said his government
was writing a new constitution to liberalize the economy and
guarantee human rights. In a move later copied by President Mobutu
Sese Seko of Zaire, he appointed a transition government but set no
date for himself to step down.
   Mobutu shocked Zaire in April when, under intense pressure from
the United States and other Western backers, he said he would give
in to demands for multiparty democracy.
   Student unrest continued and Belgium, the former colonial power,
accused Zairean commandos in May of killing more than 100 at
Lubumbashi University. Mobutu's government claimed only one student
was killed and blamed local government officials.
   In November, six months after Mobutu legalized opposition
parties, soldiers still were breaking up their meetings.
   On Nov. 6, opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said Mobutu had
ordered him prevented from leaving the country to meet with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in the United States.
   Other leaders, like President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya,
Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone, have
said no to change and often have called out soldiers to enforce the
decision.
   Gabon moved closer to democracy than the others when President
Omar Bongo was forced to conduct the first multiparty general
election in 22 years.
   Several rounds of voting had to be held because voters smashed
ballot boxes, burned government cars and attacked officials they
claimed were rigging the election.
   Bongo emerged with a bare majority in the National Assembly, but
his term as president does not expire for three years.
   Ivory Coast held its first contested presidential election in
October. Police dispersed opposition campaign rallies with tear gas
and clubs. On election day, voters smashed ballot boxes and claimed
fraud.
   Government-controlled television and radio denied the opposition
access until the campaign was nearly over, then censored their
statements.
   Laurent Gbagbo, a history professor, was the only opposition
candidate. Two others could not raise bonds equivalent to $80,000
each, which the government announced as a requirement one week
before the 10-day campaign began.
   Everyone expected the victory of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, the octogenarian who has ruled since independence
from France in 1960, but many doubt he got the 81.67 percent of the
vote his government claims.
   The country's first multiparty parliamentary election was held
Sunday, and opposition leaders claimed it was marred by
intimidation and fraud perpetrated by Houphouet-Boigny's Democratic
Party. Turnout was light.
   The Democrats were expected to easily win a majority,
reinforcing Houphouet-Boigny's huge victory last month.

   Four storage tanks holding more than 2 million
gallons of jet fuel caught fire Sunday near Stapleton International
Airport, snarling comings and goings at the terminal as holiday
travelers headed home after Thanksgiving.
   A fire at a holding pond that had collected some of the spilled
fuel was extinguished with foam, but authorities feared it might
reignite and spread to a nearby 2 million-gallon fuel tank.
   Firefighters had been trying to cool two 800,000-gallon tanks
containing jet fuel throughout the day, spraying them with strong
jets of water, but they caught fire about 10 p.m.
   When the two tanks ruptured, firefighters had to be pulled back.
The tanks were designed to rupture, rather than explode, when
overheated, officials said.
   An attempt to snuff that part of the fire with foam failed.
   ``We didn't have the capacity to provide foam in the amount
needed,'' Fire Chief Rich Gonzales said.
   Three firefighters were treated at Denver General Hospital for
dehydration and heat exhaustion and two others were treated for
smoke inhalation at the scene, but the fire caused no serious
injuries.
   Smoke from the blaze cast a pall over metropolitan Denver and
caused visibility problems on nearby Interstate 70, which remained
open.
   Norm Avery, a Stapleton spokesman, said the airport was open,
but United Airlines was forced to delay, cancel and divert flights
because of a fuel shortage.
   There also were traffic jams outside the airport on one of the
it's busiest days, when travelers were returning from the
Thanksgiving holiday. Stapleton is the nation's fourth-busiest U.S.
airport as measured by numbers of passengers traveling through it.
   Airport officials initially planned to contain the intial fire
and let it burn itself out, but they changed their plans when
flames altered by shifting winds began to threaten the larger
tanks.
   The fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. at the fuel tank farm
about a half-mile north of the Stapleton terminal and just south of
I-70.
   Also threatened were two tanks about 100 yards from the blaze
that held 1.5 million gallons of jet fuel each, said Mike McNeill,
a Denver Fire Department spokesman.
   The fire torched nearby utility poles and generated so much heat
that firefighters worked in 30-minute shifts near the flames.
   The blaze apparently was caused by a broken valve leading into
one of two 400,000-gallon-capacity storage tanks, and the heat from
the first fire ignited the second tank, Avery said.
   There are no homes or businesses anywhere near the site.
   The storage tanks were part of Stapleton's fuel storage farm,
which supplies jet fuel to most of the airlines at the airport. It
is the chief source of fuel for United Airlines.
   In attempting to control the fire, firefighters shut off the
underground pipeline from the tank farm to the Stapleton terminal,
and United officials were scrambling to find ways to obtain jet
fuel, said Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware.
   United Airlines reported flight delays of up to four hours out
of Denver, affecting connecting flights at other major hubs,
officials said.
   ``United is virtually out of fuel and trying to make
arrangements to get more,'' said Boulware.
   Some United flights were diverted to Colorado Springs and other
nearby airports to obtain fuel, and other flights were delayed or
canceled, United officials at the airport said.
   Boulware said Continental Airlines was forced to shift its
refueling operations to a Stapleton concourse, but this had little
effect on its operations.

   The dollar closed higher against the yen Monday,

percent from 7.465 percent.
   Currency traders said there was no major market-moving news on
hand, although reports the United States will seek U.N. approval
this week for a resolution authorizing the use of force against
Iraq spurred some dollar buying.
   Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, a dealer with Industrial Bank of Japan, said
the trading was rather active on cross trading between West German
mark and the yen, affecting the dollar-yen trading.
   ``As for dollar-yen trading, it moved in a narrow range,'' he
said.
   On the stock market, the index started higher on small-lot
buying on a broad front in a favorable reaction to a firmer bond
market, securities dealers said.

<HEAD>Legislators Face Budget Cuts After Passage of Term-Limit
Initiative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN GRUBB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California lawmakers returning to work next
week will be tackling a familiar issue: budget cuts. This time,
however, they'll be slashing their own budgets.
   Voters on Nov. 6 narrowly passed Proposition 140, which limits
lawmakers' terms, eliminates their pension benefits and demands
cuts of about 40 percent in the Legislature's budget.
   Analysts say half of the 3,200 legislative staff members could
be laid off.
   The day after the proposition passed, Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown spoke to Capitol staffers.
   ``He said, `Don't worry till after the holidays. Go ahead and
try to have a good Thanksgiving and Christmas. We've got 'til
July.''' said Michael Reese, Brown's press secretary.
   Still, most lawmakers returning for the new session Dec. 3 are
already pondering prospects of layoffs and lawsuits. Many members
of their staffs are looking for new jobs. The session lasts through
August.
   The Senate Rules Committee sent a memo suggesting senators begin
planning staff reductions. The committee said it would offer
``golden handshakes'' to encourage long-time employees to retire.
   ``What's out there permeating the place is the human factor,''
said Bob Forsyth, a spokesman for Sen. David Roberti, chairman of
the committee. ``I think most people who came to work for the
Legislature came here voluntarily. They do not get civil service
benefits. They're anxious about their job futures.''
   Proposition 140 passed with 52 percent of the vote. It was
backed by anti-tax crusader Lewis Uhler and conservative Republican
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum.
   It limits Assembly members to three two-year terms. Senate
members, the governor and other elected statewide officials, and
members of a state tax board, can serve no more than two four-year
terms.
   The measure also eliminates legislators' pension benefits,
leaving only what had been accrued by Election Day. The mandated
legislative budget cuts must be made by July 1, but the proposition
does not spell out how.
   ``I think it's clear then when you have over 3,000 legislative
employees, you could probably prune pretty heavily and still get
the legitimate legislative business done,'' Uhler said.
   San Francisco attorney Joe Remcho said he believes Proposition
140 is vulnerable to a legal challenge. The Senate Rules Committee
is also reviewing the legal issues involved.
   Remcho successfully sued on behalf of the Legislature's
Democratic leaders and others to overturn a campaign spending
initiative approved by voters in 1988. Backers of the measure are
appealing that federal court decision.
   Remcho said lifetime term limits on legislators disenfranchise
voters, particularly minorities.
   Uhler said the initiative was drafted to withstand court
challenges. Sponsors reluctantly agreed to give incumbens the same
fresh six- to eight-year limits newcomers face, he said.
   ``That's a long time for those who carry grudges in the
Legislature and who seek retribution, a lot of time for that to
play out,'' Uhler said.

<HEAD>Big Three Shutdowns to Idle About 40,000 Workers This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers are blaming economic
uncertainty and dealer backlogs for the temporary layoff of 38,800
employees.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said the
layoffs would begin today and run through Dec. 7 at 14 assembly
plants in eight states.
   ``We are watching the marketplace and then we adjust production
to meet those needs,'' Kathy Tanner, spokeswoman for GM's
Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group, said Sunday.
   Additional layoffs would be announced five to 10 days before
they were to be imposed, officials said.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see more,'' said Joel Pitcoff,
Ford's research and analysis manager.
   ``We've been having shortages of dealer orders for some time,''
Pitcoff said. ``It's clear the dealers are nervous about the
recession talk.''
   The shutdowns won't put a big pinch on workers' wallets.
Contract agreements with the United Auto Workers union provide
laid-off workers with up to 95 percent pay during shutdowns.
   The layoffs are an indication of a slowdown in the industry,
with manufacturers possibly wanting to avoid the over-buildup they
experienced a year ago when 107,000 Big Three workers were
furloughed in January.
   Ward's Automotive Report, an industry newsletter, reported
inventory for the nine major U.S. automakers stood at 72 days Nov.
10, compared with 88 days in December 1989.
   The largest single layoff will be at Chrysler's Toledo, Ohio,
plant, where company spokesman Doug Nicoll said about 4,700 workers
are affected.
   GM announced about 21,900 layoffs, and Ford has furloughed about
12,200 workers.

<HEAD>Florida Panther Genes Diluted, Protection in Jeopardy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genetic tests show that as many as half the 50
Florida panthers still remaining in the wild may not be true
Florida panthers at all, but a hybrid species, biologists said.
   Scientists warn that if the hybrids found in Everglades National
Park and the neighboring Big Cypress Swamp area continue to dilute
true Florida panthers' bloodlines, the species could become so
watered down it could lose its place on the endangered-species
list.
   ``If the panther were to lose protection, then the entirety of
wild Florida is left open to development,'' says Melody Roelke, who
studies panthers for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission.
   If bumped off the list, the cats would no longer be protected by
a federal ban on killing or capturing them. The federal Endangered
Species Act doesn't cover hybrid animals.
   Genetic tests of 26 panthers in South Florida showed only 13
were true Florida panthers. The others were a hybrid of Florida
panthers and a South American cousin released into the wild in the
1950s and 1960s.
   The pure descendants of true Florida panthers are characterized
by a kink in the tail and a cowlick, of ruff of spiky hair, on
their tawny colored backs. They live mostly in the Big Cypress
National Preserve.
   The others, descendants of Florida panthers and seven captive
cats released into the wild between 1957 and 1967, also are tawny
colored.
   Similar cross-breeding has prompted officials to consider
removing others from the endangered species list.
   The federal Farm Bureau has asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to take the gray wolf off the list because genetic evidence
shows some gray wolves cross-bred with coyotes.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
chose Monterrey for the summit with President Bush because this
northern city symbolizes the economic miracle he envisions for
Mexico.
   But as Bush arrives to discuss a free trade agreement, some
businessmen fear Mexican industry could suffer under such a pact.
   ``It's inevitable: Some businesses will fail, others will have
to change,'' said Miguel Garza, who owns a ceramics factory. ``It's
a new world.''
   Because the agreement has not taken form, uncertainty is mixed
with the skepticism. Formal negotiations don't begin until next
year and could take two years to complete.
   ``A free trade agreement will not change our situation and could
help us,'' said Ernesto Garcia Martinez, director of Cifunsa, an
auto parts company in nearby Saltillo. ``The Mexican automotive
industry has proven itself for quality and volume.''
   Labor leaders predict a free trade agreement will cost jobs by
creating a form of economic Darwinism that will choke industries
unable to compete with U.S. technology and industrial efficiency.
   When President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Monterrey in 1943,
it already was on the way to becoming Mexico's industrial capital.
   ``We are the locomotive that is pulling the nation to
modernization,'' Mayor Socrates Rizzo says now.
   Glass-and-steel towers occupied by businessmen with U.S.
university degrees have come to overshadow the colonial buildings
and cobbled streets of Old Monterrey.
   The city glitters with prosperity, but city workers made it over
for the summit nonetheless, painting buildings and repairing
streets while White House teams checked security arrangements.
   More than 1,000 telephone lines were installed to accommodate
hundreds of journalists. A heliport was built in Monterrey and an
airstrip added to Salinas' nearby hometown of Agualeguas for the
Bush visit.
   On a mountain facing Monterrey's 100-acre Grand Plaza, a neon
sign flashed ``Welcome'' in English and Spanish.
   The monument to the meeting between Roosevelt and President
Manuel Avila Camacho, a large concrete cross on a street corner,
had been vandalized and its plaque was missing. It was cleaned up,
repaired and moved to a park.
   A monument to the Bush visit has a flame that will remain
lighted while he is here.
   Interdependence with the United States has developed in
Monterrey through cross-border culture, U.S.-owned assembly plants
and travel. The city is 150 miles from Texas, and the U.S.
consulate issued more than 200,000 visas last year for travel north
of the border.
   Nuevo Leon state, of which Monterrey is the capital, now has
7,500 businesses. The number is expected to increase with a free
trade agreement and completion of new border-crossing facilities
and bridges.
   Monterrey's press is generally recognized as the fairest and
most aggressive in Mexico. The newspaper El Norte prepared a
100-page bilingual special section for the summit.
   In a year, the city plans to open one of Latin America's largest
art museums. A 17-mile light rail transit system is to begin
service in March and an international business and trade show
center will be inaugurated in the spring.

<HEAD>Kasparov, Karpov Agree to a Draw</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The second half of the World Championship
between chess masters and arch-rivals Garry Kasparov and Anatoly
Karpov began with a draw.
   They were to return to the table today for the second game of
the championship's French phase.
   The 13th game had adjourned Saturday night after 41 moves in
five hours of play with a draw inevitable, according to the
experts.
   Karpov, who is trying to regain the world championship title
from defender Kasparov, proposed the draw on Sunday by telephone
through the intermediary of Dutch referee Geurt Gijssen, officials
said, an option open to either player.
   Kasparov accepted.
   Karpov, playing white, would have opened Sunday's play with the
42nd move, which was sealed Saturday night in an envelope.
   Kasparov, 27, and Karpov, 39, now each have 6{ points. They were
tied at six points apiece after the first 12 games in New York from
Oct. 8 to Nov. 7 - 10 of which were draws.
   The first player to gain 12{ points wins the championship and
$1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In the event of a tie, Kasparov
retains the title.
   Saturday's match in the main auditorium of the Palais des
Congres in this southcentral city was the first in the championship
series in two weeks.
   Karpov moved the queen's pawn to begin play. The players went
through a series of moves known as the Grunfeld defense, which was
used in Game 9.
   Kasparov varied it a bit when he castled on the eighth move.
   The pair traded queens before the 20th move and were reduced to
eight pieces each by the 30th.
   Karpov repeatedly left his chair in the early part of the match.
Kasparov stayed at the board, hunched over in deep thought.
   At the adjournment, Kasparov had just taken a pawn to finish
with five pawns, a rook and the king.
   Karpov had four pawns, a rook and a king but was about to take a
black pawn to even things up again.
   Karpov waited more than 10 minutes as the five-hour time limit
drew close before sealing his 42nd move.
   ``I thought it was reasonable exciting,'' said international
grandmaster Mike Valvo of Perth Amboy, N.J. ``It was not a dull
25-30 move draw you would see in other matches.''
   Karpov ran into a time problem as the time limit approached,
with only nine minutes to complete eight moves. Each player is
alloted 2{ hours for his first 40 moves.
   But Karpov moved eight times in his next seven minutes.
   ``Most of us who sat and watched thought that white had chances
to win,'' Valvo said. ``In time pressure, Karpov seemed to let
whatever edge he had slip away.''
   Kasparov gained the title in 1985 from Karpov, who had held it
from 1975.
   Their dislike for each other is well-known.
   The two men differ in temperment, looks, politics and even
playing style.
   Kasparov considers Karpov a product of the Soviet system.
   ``Normally chess is a battle between two individuals,'' Kasparov
has said in an interview. ``But in my case, with Karpov, it's a
fight between two different mentalities in Russia. I identify him
with the system I've been fighting.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds Against Yen, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded against the yen today, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose again in thin
trading.
   The dollar closed at 127.95 yen, the day's high, up 0.82 yen
from Thursday's close of 127.13 yen. It opened at 127.50 yen and
went no lower than 127.45 yen.
   In the previous three trading days, it had fallen a total of
2.60 yen.
   Japan's markets were closed Friday for a national holiday.
   Some $6.94 billion changed hands in today's spot trading, down
from $9.95 billion on Thursday.
   Currency traders said there was no major news to move the
market, although reported U.S. plans to seek U.N. approval this
week for a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq
spurred some dollar buying.
   ``Amid a lack of incentives, the dollar moved gradually up on
short-covering,'' said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
583.29 points Thursday, added another 362.58 points, or 1.55
percent, closing at 23,762.86.
   A total of 250 million shares were traded on the first section,
down from 360 million shares Thursday.
   Securities dealers said the index rose on arbitrage and
index-linked buying.
   In arbitrage trading, investors seek to profit from price
differentials between the spot and futures markets.
   ``The market was encouraged by a firm movement on the bond
market,'' said a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 86.56, from Thursday's close of
86.11. Their yield fell to 7.365 percent from 7.465 percent.

<HEAD>Astronomers Plan Detailed 3-D Map of Universe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists eager to create a three-dimensional
map of the universe are embarking on a $14 million telescope
project aimed at exploring the origins of galaxies.
   The search of the skies is expected to produce the most detailed
charts of the universe to date, according to members of the
Astrophysical Research Consortium, a group composed of several
universities and the Princeton N.J.-based Institute for Advanced
Study.
   Scientists said they hope to produce a three-dimensional layout
of 1 million galaxies, 100,000 quasars and numerous intergalactic
gas clouds.
   A two-dimensional color version of 100 million galaxies also is
planned.
   The survey ``is the cosmic equivalent of a U.S. Geological
Survey map,'' said Richard Kron, a professor of astronomy and
astrophysics at the University of Chicago.
   ``It will show the details of galaxy and quasar distribution as
well as the large-scale `geography' of the universe,'' Kron said.
   Quasars are starlike, celestial objects that produce immense
quantities of light or powerful radio waves, or both.
   The University of Chicago is a member of the consortium that
includes the Institute for Advanced Study, New Mexico State
University, Princeton University, the University of Washington and
Washington State University.
   The consortium voted Nov. 20 to move ahead with the project,
which is scheduled to begin in 1995. The University of Chicago,
Princeton and the Institute for Advance Study will split the costs,
said University of Chicago spokesman Larry Arbeiter.
   The new telescope and its instruments have been specially
designed by astronomer Jim Gunn of Princeton to map the universe
quickly. The telescope, combined with digital and robotic
technology, will enable astronomers to complete the mapping in five
to seven years, the group said.
   The telescope will be placed on Apache Point in New Mexico's
Sacramento Mountains.
   The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill. is
expected to provide the computer equipment needed to store and
analyze the survey's estimated 10 million megabytes of information
- roughly enough data to fill a telephone directory for 250 billion
people, officials said.
   Scientists say the map could help answer questions about the Big
Bang theory, which proposes that the universe was created in a
massive explosion 15 billion years ago.
   The simplest theory indicates the explosion should have
scattered matter uniformly across the universe, but galaxies are
found in clusters.
   The survey may show if still unknown sub-atomic forces or
particles formed the beginnings of galaxies during the Big Bang,
scientists said.
   Information gathered by the survey may also provide astronomers
with an insight into the nature of ``dark matter'' - material that
has been detected through its gravity but remains unidentified.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa faces a runoff in Poland's
presidential contest, but if it were up to the 36,000 Poles who
cast ballots in North America he'd already be in office.
   ``He is the only man for the job,'' St. Louis cab driver
Alexander Gorka said Sunday. ``He can take the country out of the
critical situation it's in.''
   Walesa, the Solidarity leader who led the revolt against four
decades of Communist rule in Poland, got 60 percent of the vote
among Poles in Canada and the United States who voted Saturday,
said Consul Andrezj Jaroszynski in Chicago.
   Citing unofficial figures, he said Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki placed second with 33 percent of the ballots cast by
36,006 voters in North America.
   Upstart emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who beat
Mazowiecki for second in voting in Poland, had about 3 percent of
the North American vote.
   In Poland, Walesa had just under 40 percent of the vote with 44
of 49 provinces reporting. Tyminski, with 23 percent, made a
surprise showing by beating Mazowiecki, who had 16 percent of the
vote. Three other candidates trailed far behind. Final results were
expected later today.
   A Dec. 9 runoff will be held between the two top vote-getters if
neither wins an outright majority.
   Gorka, who drove from St. Louis to the Polish Consulate in
Chicago to vote, said he cried when he cast his ballot for Walesa,
who had been favored to win.
   ``It was such an important day for me,'' Gorka said. ``It was
the first time in my life I had the freedom to vote in a truly
democratic election in Poland.''
   Turnout was lower than expected in Chicago, where only 9,810 of
more than 40,000 eligible voters went to three polling places,
Jaroszynski said.
   The metropolitan area has a larger bloc of Poles and
Polish-Americans, a total of 800,000 to 1.2 million, than any
municipality outside Warsaw.
   More than 16,000 ballots were cast in New York state, according
to the consulate in New York City.
   Alderman Roman C. Pucinski, a Walesa supporter, said returns in
Chicago, especially in the heavily Polish 41st ward he represents,
show Walesa ``does get his strength from the blue collar workers.''
   In Chicago, Walesa got 76 percent of the vote to Mazowiecki's 18
percent.
   Unofficial North American results showed Walesa with 21,608, or
60 percent; Mazowiecki with 11,823, or 33 percent; Tyminski with
1,238, or 3 percent; and the remainder for the other three
candidates, Jaroszynski said.
   Poland allows naturalized U.S. citizens to hold Polish passports
and vote. Newly arrived immigrants and visitors to the United
States also could vote. Balloting was at sites in North America on
Saturday; voting by mail was not permitted.

<HEAD>China Charges Two With Sedition, Seeks To Wrap Up Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have charged two prominent figures in
last year's pro-democracy movement with plotting to overthrow the
government, a crime punishable by death, Chinese sources said
today.
   The charges against Chen Zeming, publisher of the now-banned
Economic Studies Weekly, and Wang Juntao, its editor, are the most
serious to be brought so far against intellectuals involved in the
pro-democracy movement.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said relatives
of the two men received formal notices late last week that Chen and
Wang had been charged with ``plotting to overthrow the government
and counterrevolutionary incitement.''
   The Beijing city Foreign Affairs Office said it had not heard
about the charges.
   The government's move, more than a year after the two men were
arrested, indicated its desire to wrap up remaining cases from the
protest movement and put the controversial events behind it.
   Other sources have said the government is preparing to hold
trials for alleged ringleaders of the protests, which began with
student marches in Beijing in April 1989 and spread nationwide. The
movement was crushed when the army opened fire on protesters in
Beijing two months later, killing hundreds on unarmed civilians.
   Hundreds of participants in the protests already have been sent
to labor camps, a punishment that requires no trial. Dozens of
others have been tried secretly, and at least 18 are known to have
been executed.
   However, none of the alleged ringleaders has yet been put on
trial. One reason is the Communist Party's fear that trials would
require releasing information about the involvement of high-level
party officials in the movement. The party has closed its
investigation of ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang without announcing
any conclusions or punishment for that very reason.
   Zhao was dismissed as party general secretary last year for
allegedly supporting the democracy movement.
   Chen and Wang acted as advisers to the Beijing student protests,
helping plan the strategy of early student marches and formulate
demands.
   Both got their first experience in confronting the government in
1976, when they joined a protest in Tiananmen Square against the
radical leftist officials who led the destructive Cultural
Revolution.
   They were arrested then, but were released when the Cultural
Revolution leadership was ousted and the protest was officially
reappraised as patriotic.
   Wang became a leader in the Communist Youth League, but
continued challenging the official line. He helped found an
unofficial journal called Beijing Spring in 1978 during a brief
period of open political debate called the Democracy Wall Movement.
Many other participants in that movement were jailed.
   He and Wang were arrested in October 1989, in Canton, where they
apparently were trying to flee the country.
   Family members have not been allowed to visit Wang and Chen in
prison, although they have been allowed to send books and clothing.
Wang's wife, Hou Xiaotian, also was jailed for several months after
the protests. She was recently released from a hospital after being
treated for ailments she said were related to her prison stay.
   The government recently set up a special group of lawyers to
defend protesters brought to trial. Sources said the protesters
would not be allowed to hire their own lawyers or organize their
own defense.
   Authorities say 355 people remain in jail under investigation in
Beijing in connection with the democracy movement, and two in
Shanghai. No figures have been released for the rest of the
country.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To silence critics who suggested selling
nearly empty buses and using the money to buy lonely riders cars of
their own, officials made bus rides free, but the gravy train is
nearing the end of the line.
   Starting New Year's Day, the buses will cost 50 cents again,
meaning riders will have to pay for the first time in 15 months.
   Under an order approved by the Capital Metropolitan
Transportation Authority board, the elderly and disabled would
remain exempt from the renewed fee.
   Some downtown express service still won't cost anything and
there will be discounted bus passes available, but some say free
rides should not end because the move attracted tens of thousands
of new riders.
   City Councilman Max Nofziger, who serves on the transportation
oversight panel, wants to keep the no-fare system, pointing to a
three-quarter cent sales tax that funds the bus system.
   ``I don't think they should charge the riders an additional fee
to actually get on the buses, because those folks have already paid
once through the sales tax,'' Nofziger said.
   A panel of elected officials must review the decision to
reinstate fares, which was approved 4-3 by the Capital Metro board
after considering reports of problem passengers and concerns about
lost revenue.
   Capital Metro board members Lyndon Henry and Dennis Garza said
the system is losing $3.8 million a year.
   ``No other transit system in the country is doing what we're
doing, and I think for good reason,'' Garza said. ``They can't
afford it.''
   Dennis Kouba of the American Public Transit Association in
Washington said he knows of no other city offering free bus fares.
   The elimination of fares began as a three-month program in
October 1989, when jokes abounded about the number of empty city
buses rolling around town. The running gag was that selling the
buses and buying riders cars would save money.
   After fares were suspenced, ridership grew by 82 percent in the
first nine months of 1990, compared to the same period last year,
said Capital Metro spokesman Howard Goldman.
   On the average weekday in September 1989, 50,765 people rode the
bus. This September, the average was 84,540.
   The president of the local bus driver's union, Joneth Wyatt,
said a big drawback of the free-ride program has been problem
passengers.
   ``People tend to disrespect something that you get for free,''
Wyatt said. He said the city traded ``good passengers for the bad
passengers.''
   ``We gained the transients, we gained a lot more school kids who
would normally walk to school, we gained the gangs, the
undesirables,'' Wyatt. Lost, he said, were ``everyday working
people.''

<TEXT>
   An early morning explosion delayed service on an
express ``bullet train'' line today but did not prevent Emperor
Akihito from taking the railroad hours later to an ancient shrine
for a rite of enthronement.
   Police found batteries at the site of the explosion and suspect
the bombing was the work of ultra-leftist radicals who oppose the
monarchy.
   A loud explosion was heard at about 6 a.m. near Shin Yokohama
Station, about 12 miles west of Tokyo. Pieces of a concrete wall
were thrown as far as 110 yards and blocked the tracks, halting the
train service for two hours, police said. No injuries were
reported.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko boarded an express train on the line
six hours after the explosion, bound to pay their respects to the
imperial family's ancestral deities enshrined in Ise in central
Japan. They were not delayed.
   Akihito's enthronement ceremony was held Nov. 12.
   Last week, he offered sacred rice to the gods in a controversial
rite called the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering.
   Ultra-leftists, who oppose the imperial system as symbolic of
Japna's militarist past, have publicly declared their intentions to
disrupt enthronement-related rites that continue until early
December.
   Police reported nearly 40 incidents on enthronement day alone,
including attacks with homemade mortars and arson at several
shrines. One police officer was killed in an earlier bombing at a
Tokyo police dormitory.

   The dollar continued its strong gains against the

   Gold was higher.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.95 yen, the day's high, up
0.82 yen from Thursday's close of 127.13 yen. There was no trading

the life of a white girl raised by a black couple.
   ``Pretty Hattie's Baby'' also stars Broadway actor Charles
Dutton, known for his role in ``The Piano Lesson.''
   The film depicts the struggle of Fauna Hodel, now 39, to
discover her identity during her childhood with the late Homer and
Jimmie Faison in Sparks, Nev. The woman suffered ridicule from
whites and blacks while growing up.
   Mrs. Faison was working as a hotel cleaning woman in 1951 when
she met a white woman from San Francisco who asked her to take in
an illegitimate baby. The film directed by Ivan Passer is scheduled

   Jewish college students who share a
kosher kitchen that was defiled with anti-Semitic slurs and human
waste said the incident has left them united.
   ``If we can continue having kosher meals together...then there's
still the sense of community, and of Jewish people as survivors,''
student Aline Iskander said Sunday.
   Police classified the vandalism in a section of Macalester
College's Kirk Hall dormitory as a bias crime against Jews. The
dormitory section is known as Hebrew House.
   Ted Leventhal, 21, a former director of Hebrew House, said he
and two friends who iive there found an obscene note and a mixing
bowl filled with feces in the kitchen Friday night.
   The note read in part: ``Achtung... Can't you clean up after
yourselves? Didn't Hitler teach you nothing? Remember neatness
reflects your character? Shape up or ship out!!!''
   In signing the note, the vandals claimed to be members of the
Aryan Youth Movement. Police officer Larry Sandell said police have
no information about the group.
   The intruders also broke eggs, extinguished cigarettes on the
carpet and littered the floor with beer cans and other debris.
   Hebrew House has its own kitchen so Jewish students in Kirk Hall
can prepare kosher meals under strict religious standards.
   ``I think they knew that striking in the kitchen, defiling the
kitchen, would have been significant to the house,'' Leventhal
said.
   The kitchen will be cleaned and blessed before it is used again.
   ``The message is sickening, and anti-Semitism is sickening,''
said Robert Gavin, president of the small liberal arts college. ``I
certainly find it abhorrent.''
   Police are investigating the incident. Gavin said access to the
kitchen would be restricted.
   Bernard Raskas, a rabbi emeritus of Temple of Aaron in St. Paul
and a Macalester faculty member, called the incident shocking.
   ``My first reaction is that this is the product of sick and
twisted personalities, and they need help,'' Raskas said. ``On the
other hand, one is not surprised with the rising tide of
anti-Semitism all over the world.''
   About 8 percent of Macalester's 1,750 students are Jewish.

   Iraq today denounced U.S. plans to seek a
U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing military force in the
Persian Gulf and said it would not withdraw from Kuwait even if
such a resolution were approved.
   ``If anybody believes that this newest resolution will influence
our position or force us to abandon our rights, they are completely
wrong. We respect U.N. resolutions only when they are just and
balanced,'' the ruling Baath party said in its daily newspaper,
Al-Thawra.
   The front-page editorial was the first official reaction to
reports that the United States would ask the Security Council to
approve military force unless Iraq withdraws its troops by Jan. 1.
   The proposed resolution was circulated as the council prepared
to begin debate on new steps to try to resolve the Persian Gulf
crisis. If adopted, it would mark the strongest step taken by the
council since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Baghdad has refused to abide by previous resolutions demanding
that it withdraw from Kuwait.
   Ten days after the invasion, President Saddam Hussein said he
would negotiate about Kuwait if talks were also held on other
Middle East problems, specifically the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Iraq has insisted that the Security Council resolution calling
for Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian lands must also be
implemented if it is to abide by resolutions on the Persian Gulf.
   Al-Thawra claimed the United States is using ``terrorism,
threats and blackmail'' to try to win approval for the resolution.
   The editorial urged other Security Council members to vote
against the resolution, which it said would pave the way for ``an
overall American hegemony, not only in the region, but in the world
at large.''
   ``Nobody should blame us if we say that what's going on in the
Security Council is a scandal on a wide-scale level, which violates
all international laws and norms,'' Al-Thawra said.
   ``We wonder how other parties themselves will react to the
American attempt to impose their hegemony and tyranny over the
whole world,'' it said.

   A Marine who expected to ship out to Saudi
Arabia in January was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he went
to the aid of a stranded motorist.
   Lance Cpl. Reynaldo Martindale, 19, of the New York borough of
Brooklyn, was here on a Thanksgiving visit with his family.
   Martindale and a friend, Steven Morales, 24, were en route early
Sunday morning to La Guardia Airport - where Martindale was to
catch a flight back to Camp Lejeune, N.C. - when they saw a
disabled car on the expressway, police said.
   Morales told Barbara Perrino, a spokeswoman for Jamaica
Hospital, that they stopped to push the car off the road and
Martindale was hit by a light green car that dragged him 50 feet.
   Morales was injured and was listed in stable condition today at
the hospital. The people in the car were uninjured, police said.
   When Martindale died, so did his dream of a career in the
military, a dream that began in his native Trinidad, his father
said Sunday night.
   ``He always wanted to join the military since he was a kid,''
said Jeffrey Martindale. ``He was so contented, so happy.''
   ``If all kids were like him, you'd have a perfect world.''
   Morales said he heard a bang ``and then I looked over to my side
and I didn't see my friend. ... I lost a very dear friend.
   ``He wanted to do one last good deed before going to Saudi
Arabia. I thought he'd go over there and maybe die for his country
instead of on some highway.''
   Reynaldo Martindale was assigned to an engineering battalion at
Camp Lejeune, according to his father.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a shocking-pink picture of Tokyo's skyline
gracing its front page, Japan's first newspaper designed for women
- Lady Kong - hit the newsstands today with lots of fluff but
little feminism.
   As with virtually all enterprises here, men run the daily
tabloid, leading some critics to complain that the publication is
not likely to challenge the subservient role of women in Japanese
society.
   ``Everything, even sanitary napkins, has been planned and
produced by men,'' said Harueko Kato, a communications professor at
Tokyo Women's Christian University. ``And news coverage is not an
exception.''
   The tabloid's name refers to King Kong's girlfriend. The name
apparently is meant to show that women are strong, too.
   Kato believes the most important aspect of the new daily
newspaper will be ``how the opinions of the female employees are
reflected in the decision-making and news writing.''
   That will depend to a large extent on Masahiro Oshima, the
41-year-old man who is the tabloid's editorial director.
   Twenty-seven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are
women, but they are in charge of only the entertainment and city
guide sections.
   The company specifically recruited male writers to work in the
news department, Oshima explained, ``to give news stories a serious
tone.''
   Despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its
odd name and its advertisements suggesting greater independence for
women, there appears to be little emphasis on feminism and social
issues.
   The leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for
Tokyo's commuter trains to extend operations a few hours each night
to 2 a.m. for the benefit of people who stay out late drinking and
dancing.
   The rest of the 80-cent newspaper, which describes itself in
English as a ``newsy tabloid for Tokyoites,'' reads like a typical
fashion magazine with a few pages of news slapped onto the front.
   The first edition included a series of interviews with female
business executives, as well as a soft-porn story titled ``Honest
Legs,'' gossip items and entertainment news.
   Oshima says he had wanted to carry more features on social
issues, but a six-month marketing research program led him to
reduce stories on politics, business, women's issues and the
environment.
   ``Japanese women are not ready for such a progressive paper ...
I was quite disappointed to discover that,'' he said in a recent
interview at his office.
   To achieve its daily circulation goal of 350,000, Lady Kong
largely reflects the editorial content of the many popular women's
magazines already flooding the market with heavy doses of fashion,
cooking and new products.
   The tabloid says it also is trying to attract female readers by
using stain-free print that does not rub off. Young Japanese women
often complain that ink from the regular broadsheet newspapers
dirties their hands and expensive designer dresses.
   One kiosk in central Tokyo carried a few dozen issues of Lady
Kong along hundreds of existing tabloids that aim exclusively at a
male readership - heavy with sports coverage and female nudes.
   Lady Kong is a joint venture between a Japanese publisher and a
British brokerage. Investors include Orient Co., the nation's
leading finance company.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council have reached agreement on a draft accord to settle the
Cambodian conflict, U.S. officials said today.
   The agreement paves the way for reconvening the Paris Conference
on Cambodia in the next few months, said Richard Solomon, the
assistant secretary of state who represented the United States in
the three days of talks that ended Sunday.
   ``This was an important step forward in the process of a
political settlement'' to the 12-year-old Cambodian civil war,
Solomon said.
   The latest talks brought together the five permanent Security
Council members - the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union,
China and France - as well as representatives of Indonesia and the
United Nations. France and Indonesia are co-chairs of the Paris
Conference on Cambodia, which closed in failure in 1989. Indonesia
also agreed to the draft accord.
   A statement issued by participants in the talks said it is
``urgent'' that the four Cambodian factions resolve differences
over leadership of the Supreme National Council.
   The Supreme National Council is to help guide Cambodia through
elections after a truce. It has six representatives from the
government and six from the three-party resistance coalition led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The council's first meeting broke down Sept. 17 over guerrilla
demands that Sihanouk be its chairman and 13th member. The Phnom
Penh government says making Sihanouk head of the council would tip
the balance in the coalition's favor.
   The statement by the five permanent Security Council members
said they would welcome the election of Sihanouk to head the
council, but that Cambodians themselves should work out a formula
for the body's composition.
   On Sunday, Sihanouk urged the government and the three
resistance groups to meet as soon as possible in Paris to discuss
their differences.
   The ``draft comprehensive political settlement'' agreed to after
the latest talks in Paris is based on the framework agreement of
August and endorsed by the Security Council and the U.N. General
Assembly.
   It contains a draft agreement covering major aspects of the
settlement, as well as five annexes to the political settlement
dealing with the U.N. role, a cease-fire and withdrawal of foreign
forces, elections, repatriation of Cambodian refugees and
principles for a new constitution.
   The five Security Council members also set out a draft agreement
on the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and
neutrality of Cambodia and a draft declaration on rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the nation.
   The resistance coalition has been fighting the Hun Sen
government since it was installed after the Vietnamese invaded in
December 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge, which had killed a
million people during its reign.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest military arm in Sihanouk's
resistance coalition.

   Israel urged Egypt today to clamp down on
extremists after a lone gunman crossed the lightly patrolled
frontier and killed four Israelis in a roadside ambush before being
shot and retreating into Egypt.
   ``We cannot grow accustomed to enduring a peace with Israeli
bloodshed,'' said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
   ``The Egyptian government must understand that everything must
be done to end this serious situation, which is intolerable.
Israeli blood cannot be cheap in Egypt,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Twenty-seven people were wounded in Sunday's attack, which
occurred about 15 miles north of Eilat and was among the worst ever
along the border.
   The attacker sprayed fire from a Kalashnikov automatic rifle
into a bus and three military vehicles before he was himself shot
and fled, officials said.
   A Moslem fundamentalist group called Islamic Holy War-Jerusalem
claimed responsibility.
   Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, but there have
been periodic border incidents. The last attack was on Feb. 4 when
gunmen abmushed an Israeli tour bus in Egypt, killing nine Israelis
and wounding 20.
   Despite strong Israeli concerns about the violence, a top
Israeli army official said there are no plans to reinforce Israel's
most peaceful frontier.
   ``The Egyptian border is different than the others ... it is
border of peace, and I suggest we don't make the mistake of
relating to this border as a hot one at war, it would be a real
mistake, a psychological mistake,'' said Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron on Israel television Sunday.
   It was the third attack against Israelis in two days.
   In a suicide bombing earlier Sunday, a Lebanese woman with a
handbag packed with explosives was killed and two Israeli soldiers
were wounded in southern Lebanon.
   On Saturday, at least four Palestinian guerrillas were killed
when an Israeli navy gunboat sank a dinghy off the Lebanese coast.
A Palestinian group said four of the guerrillas were missing but
one swam ashore. It said the guerrillas had planned a raid in
Israel.
   Following the shooting near Eilat, Egyptian soldiers captured a
suspect described as an border policeman stationed in the area, a
senior Egyptian security source said. Israeli reports said the
suspect suffered a head wound after a bus guard shot at him as he
fled.
   The assailant's blood-stained flak jacket was found on the
Israeli side of the border, with ``Allah'' written on it, army
radio reported.
   During the half-hour rampage, the gunman killed the drivers of
all four vehicles he attacked. Three of the drivers were soldiers,
and most of the wounded were civilians, the army said.
   The assailant had acrossed the border through a dry river bed
early in the morning, taking up a position near a gravel shoulder
of a road, army and television reports said.
   Passengers on Egged Co. bus recounted moments of terror and
confusion after the gunman flagged down the bus.
   ``Ten seconds didn't pass before we were showered with gunfire.
Everyone hit the floor ... It was a difficult sight. There was
blood and glass everywhere, the windshield was full of bullet
holes,'' said Nuriel Yehud, 35, of Eilat, a construction worker at
a nearby army base.
   The gunman fled as a guard on the bus returned fire with an Uzi
submachine gun.
   Sunday's attack was claimed in Jordan's capital of Amman by a
Moslem group called Islamic Jihad-Beit Al-Maqdes, or Islamic
Holy-War Jerusalem. Their statement said the shootings were in
memory of Suliman Khater, an Egyptian policeman who shot to death
seven Israelis, including four children, in Sinai in October 1985.
   Khater hanged himself four months later in a Cairo, Egypt,
prison hospital, according to the Egyptian authorities.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack
appeared to be an outgrowth of ``incitement by many factors in the
Arab world like (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein.''
   Legislators from right and left-wing parties called for an
urgent Parliament debate.

   Snow and chilly temperatures helped firefighters battle two huge
range fires in Montana, and dying winds aided efforts to extinguish
a wildfire that destroyed 10 mountain homes in Coloradao.
   Firefighters in Colorado took advantage of a break in high winds
that reached up to 70 mph over the weekend to build a fire line
Sunday around the Olde Stage Road fire that consumed 2,200 acres in
the rugged foothills northwest of Boulder. Officials said they
expected the blaze to be under control today.
   There were no serious injuries reported in either Colorado or
Montana, but several firefighters were overcome by heat, smoke and
exhaustion after battling the Colorado blaze since early Saturday
morning.
   In Montana, snow fell Sunday night on two fires that were the
largest of a swarm that swept over an estimated 45,000 acres of
grass and timber Friday night and Saturday, racing across the
central Montana range on winds that gusted up to 100 mph.
   The smaller of the two huge range fires, a 10,000-acre blaze
that reached within a quarter-mile of the tiny community of
Bohemian Corners north of Lewistown, was extinguished early today.
   ``It is out. We had about 2 to 3 inches of snow last night. Any
hot spots are well out now,'' Fergus County Deputy Sheriff Ron
Rowton said.
   Several homes were destroyed, and ranches lost numerous
outbuildings in the Montana fires.
   About 280 firefighters worked on the lines Sunday at the Turkey
fire, which burned about 32,000 acres near the farming communities
of Stanford and Hobson, east of Great Falls, said Jane Weber,
spokeswoman for the Lewis and Clark National Forest.
   Officials said fire lines had been finished around 90 percent of
the blaze, and officials expected to have the fire under control by
Tuesday, Weber said.
   Local ranchers said they believed the blaze was sparked by
Forest Service ``slash fires,'' or controlled burns designed to
clear dead timber and other debris from heavily wooded areas.
   Jerry Dombrovske, district ranger for Stanford, said several
slash fires begun in 8 inches of snow Nov. 6 were still smoldering
Friday, the day the fire began raging. But Dombrovske said he
dispatched several staffers earlier that day to extinguish any
remaining hot spots.
   In Colorado, two National Guard helicopters continued to drop
250-gallon buckets of water on hot spots on the Olde Stage Road
fire, but officials said the blaze may be extinguished today.
   Arnold Stein, 62, was being held in Boulder County Jail for
investigation of felony fourth-degree arson, reckless endangerment
and firing woods and prairies. He was arrested Saturday.
   Authorities said Stein dragged a burning mattress from his home
early Saturday, and the fire was spread rapidly by strong winds. It
was not immediately known how the mattress fire started.
   Boulder County Sheriff's Deputy Anthony Matthews said Stein
lapsed into an incoherent account of the fire.
   ``He referred to the ensuing fire as World War III and said he
was on a suicide mission,'' Matthews said in a report made
available Sunday. ``He also said that it all must be a dream and
that it was not reality.''
   Stein was scheduled to appear in court today.
   The fire consumed Stein's home and nine others. Another home was
damaged, and five outbuildings were destroyed.

   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's
party won an overwhelming majority in parliament in multiparty
elections that ended 30 years of unchallenged rule, the government
said today.
   Opposition politicians accused the governing party of
intimidation and fraud during Sunday's voting.
   The Interior Ministry said the governing Democratic Party won
163 seats in the 175-member assembly, while the Popular Front, the
main opposition party, won nine of 10 seats captured by government
opponents. The remaining two seats went to governing party members
who ran as independents.
   Two opposition leaders who both are university professors were
elected - the Popular Front's Laurent Gbagbo, and Francis Wodie,
head of the Ivorian Workers' Party and dean of Abidjan University
Faculty of Law.
   Wodie, a former president of the Amnesty International human
rights organization, beat Gbagbo's top ally and two candidates from
the governing party to win the seat for the affluent Cocody suburb
where Houphouet-Boigny voted.
   Wodie said in an interview that, ``it is difficult to believe
tese results are correct ... that the opposition is in such a
minority.''
   He blamed a low voter turnout, which he estimated at between 50
percent and 60 percent, and suggested some Ivorians did not bother
to vote believing balloting would be rigged.
   The Democratic Party had been expected to win, but not with such
a vast majority.
   Its victory reinforced Houphouet-Boigny's re-election last month
in the first contested presidential race in this West African
nation's 30 years of independence, all under his rule.
   The president's sole challenger, Gbagbo, has charged that the
governing party also rigged that election, in which the
octogenarian president was awarded 81.67 percent of votes.
   About 4.4 million people registered to vote in the contest among
490 candidates from 19 parties. Results are not official until the
Supreme Court ratifies the count later this week.
   Popular Front officials charged that the governing party hired
thugs to intimidate voters.
   In Abidjan's high density suburb of Yopougon, for example, they
said thugs drove three cars into a crowd of their followers on
Saturday, injuring several. In an ensuing fight, 17 people were
hurt and 10 of them were being treated in the hospital, a spokesman
said.
   Yopougon's deputy mayor, Mustapha Doukoure, said Popular Front
militants provoked the clash by attacking governing party
supporters with sticks and stones to stop them from holding a
peaceful march.
   He said 37 of his supporters were injured.
   Voting was generally peaceful and policed by armed soldiers.
   The opposition alleged several irregularities.
   In Yopougon, for example, reporters found three polling stations
closed because electoral lists were missing names of voters. The
Popular Front said this was to prevent people voting in an area
where it has strong support.
   Yopougon was the site of the first pro-democracy protests in
Ivory Coast in February. Weeks of strikes and violent riots
followed, forcing Houphouet-Boigny to legalize political
opposition.
   Opposition parties were handicapped by a nationwide network the
governing party has built up over 30 years of single-party rule and
its large funds from compulsory contributions exacted from civil
servants' salaries.
   Also against them was the government's insistence that
non-Ivorian Africans working in the country be allowed to vote.
Such foreigners comprise at least a third of the 11.2 million
population, and almost all support Houphouet-Boigny.
   A security guard from neighboring Burkina Faso said he and his
brother were beaten up by Popular Front supporters when they lined
up to vote.
   He said they fled their polling station in Adjame suburb without
voting. The guard requested anonymity, saying he feared
repercussions.

<TEXT>
   More than a quarter-million railroad workers in
eastern Germany were on strike for higher pay today in the first
widespread job action since the two Germanys united seven weeks
ago.
   The strike started Sunday evening in Berlin, halting inter-city
rail traffic from the main stations in the eastern and western
halves of the city, and it spread to 26 other cities in eastern
Germany this morning, union spokesmen said.
   Pay levels in the former Communist part of the country for
almost all lines of work are about a third of western pay scales,
and most industries plan to raise eastern scales gradually over
several years to levels in the west.
   In another job action related to German unification, 10,000
civilian workers at NATO bases staged warning strikes today. Their
union, the Public Service and Transport Union, said the workers
need higher pay, job protection or retraining because NATO troop
reductions are expected to cut 23,000 of the 100,000 civilian jobs
at NATO bases.
   The warning strikes hit such major U.S. bases as Ramstein Air
Base in southwest Germany and Rhein-Main Air Base just outside
Frankfurt, union spokesman Rainer Hillgaertner said. But there was
no immediate indication of possible impact on U.S. troop movements
through the bases to the Persian Gulf, U.S. spokesmen said.
   The strikes ``are for better contracts for the workers. They are
not politically motivated and are not directed at slowing down
movement of soldiers,'' to the gulf region, Hillgaertner sad.
   NATO troop strengths in Germany are to be reduced as Soviet
troops withdraw from eastern Germany over the next four years as
part of the international agreements that permitted East and West
Germany to unify.
   The eastern and western rail companies in Germany are to be
gradually unified by 1992, but the eastern rail workers joined the
western Union of German Rail Workers months ago.
   They demand immediate raises to 50 percent to 60 percent of
levels in western Germany and protection against the layoffs
expected in many eastern industries. Last week management said it
anticipated laying off 68,000 eastern rail workers.
   The union says western rail workers get about $675 a month more
than their eastern counterparts, whose pay ranges from $675 to $945
a month.
   Commuter trains and subways were unaffected by the strike, but
its impact extended to western Germany and neighboring countries to
the east.
   Trains from western German cities such as Frankfurt and Hamburg
to Berlin and other cities in the east were canceled, and hundreds
of passengers were put on buses instead. Trains from Hungary and
Romania were stopped at the border in Czechoslovakia, according to
the Czechoslovak news agency CTK.
   Though the strike affected freight as well as passenger traffic,
the German news agency ADN reported that the rail workers were
still permitting aid shipments for Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Negotiations between the union and management broke down
Thursday and another round of talks is scheduled for Wednesday. A
poll of Eastern rail workers ended Sunday with 97 percent voting to
strike.
   There have been scattered strikes in eastern Germany since
unification of the Germanys on Oct. 3, but the job action by the
260,000 eastern rail workers was the first major strike in unified
Germany.

<TEXT>
   Stanislaw Tyminski, the political unknown
whose strong showing in presidential elections shocked observers,
apparently struck a responsive chord among voters disenchanted with
difficult economic reforms.
   Tyminski, 42, who returned to his homeland this fall after 21
years in Canada and Peru, finished second in Poland's first popular
presidential elections on Sunday, giving him a spot in the Dec. 9
runoff with Lech Walesa.
   Walesa finished first in the six-person field with 40 percent.
But Tyminski won an estimated 23 percent of the vote, enough to
shut out Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who took only 16
percent in unofficial returns.
   In his campaign, Tyminski promised Poles a quick cure for their
economic woes, a pledge he repeated today.
   ``I want to make this country rich and prosperous ... It will be
better within a month,'' he told a packed news conference today at
his headquarters.
   Tyminski said he was undaunted by the prospect of facing Walesa,
who won first fame a decade ago as the leader of Solidarity.
   ``I will win these elections, otherwise I would not have come
back,'' Tyminski said. ``I am not afraid of Walesa, I am not afraid
of anyone.''
   Opponents claim Tyminski's economic policies are wildly
unrealistic. Critics have also questioned his qualifications, his
Canadian and Peruvian citizenships, his business dealings and his
leadership of the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada, and even his
mental stability.
   For the first month of the campaign, Tyminski was not treated as
a serious contender, thus escaping media scrutiny and criticism
from rivals.
   He finally got his opponents' attention with his accusations
that the Mazowiecki government is selling off the national property
to foreigners at cut-rate prices in its bid to privatize
floundering state-owned companies.
   Tyminski also spent liberally on campaign advertisements, served
refreshments at some events and campaigned hard.
   His appeal may have been bolstered by dissatisfaction with both
Mazowiecki and Walesa, onetime Solidarity allies turned political
foes. But after the polling, both the Mazowiecki and Walesa camps
agreed on one thing: they were alarmed by Tyminski's showing.
   Walesa strategist Lech Kaczynski, Solidarity's deputy chairman,
called Tyminski a ``dangerous phenomenon.''
   Andrzej Wielowieyski, a senator allied with Mazowiecki, called
Tyminski ``an opportunity for escape'' whose showing was ``an
alarming signal.''
   ``Tyminski has revealed a black hole in Polish society,'' said
Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a chief Mazowiecki campaigner. ``It is the
result, to put it bluntly, of darkness, stupidity, a lack of
experience in democracy.''
   A state television exit poll suggested Tyminski garnered strong
support among the farm and small-town population. Political
analysts said the discontent of the Poles who voted for Tyminski
has to be taken seriously.
   ``I want to warn about making light of this electorate,'' said
Stefan Bratkowski, a well-known commentator. ``It is not an
electorate of stupid people. It is an electorate of disappointed
people.''
   Polish election law, drafted in the year since Communism was
toppled, allowed any candidate who could gather 100,000 signatures
to appear on the ballot. It did not, for example, require that a
candidate live in Poland.

   Police today investigated
reports that white men with whips attacked a group of black
children on a Sunday school trip who tried to used a public park.
   Meanwhile, police and news reports today said 19 people were
killed in clashes in various parts of the country over the weekend.
Most of them died in fighting between rival black groups. A police
statement gave few details.
   Among the incidents, the state-run South African Broadcasting
Corp. reported on Monday that nine blacks were killed late Friday
near Harding in Natal Province when two vans were ambushed. The
report gave no details on who may have been responsible for the
attack.
   Natal Province has been the scene of fighting between supporters
of the African National Congress and the conservative Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party. The two sides are divided by leadership
claims and plans for a future South Africa.
   The independent South African Press Association said several
children were injured Saturday in Louis Trichardt in the far north
of the country. The party tried to use the local park while on a
church-sponsored outing.
   About 25 white men told the children that blacks were not
allowed to use the park and ordered them to leave, SAPA said. As
the children were leaving, the whites attacked them with whips and
sticks, it said.
   The report did not say how many children were involved or how
many were injured or the seriousness of the injuries.
   Rev. George Mohali, who was leading the Sunday school trip, said
police were in the area, but did nothing to stop the attack. He
said he complained later to police and was told to come back with
the children who had been assaulted.
   Police Lt. Werner Voigt said authorities would not tolerate such
incidents and senior officers were investigating the incident.
   The government recently scrapped apartheid laws that segregated
parks and other public facilities. Some right-wing local
governments and their supporters refuse to accept the changes and
have attempted to stop blacks using facilities previously reserved
for whites.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end apartheid and share
power with the black majority. The pro-apartheid opposition
Conservative Party refuses to accept the reforms.

   The Foreign Ministry said today Iraq's failure to
free 1,000 Soviets could lead to a ``tougher attitude'' toward
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin demanded the immediate
release of the Soviets. He also told reporters Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq
for four hours today to reiterate the demand that Iraq withdraws
its troops from Kuwait.
   Churkin said Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia
would meet with Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   He said Iraq agree to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract
workers, to leave during November but that only about 350 were
permitted to do so.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000
Soviets, including several hundred military advisers, in Iraq.
About 3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to
leave shortly after the invasion and about 1,000 left during
September and October.
   Churkin said Iraq agreed to allow another 1,000 to leave in
November, but is not living up to its promise. ``Iraq is not
keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from
leaving,'' he said. ``This is totally abnormal and unacceptable.''
   He added, ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and
allow our citizens to leave, this will complicate the present
situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude.''
   Churkin said that to his knowledge, no Soviets were being
detained at potential military targets. ``All (Soviet) nationals
are still where they were before the crisis,'' he said.
   Iraq has prevented hundreds of foreigners from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait since Saddam Hussein's troops overran the emirate four
months ago. It has been slowly releasing some foreigners.

<TEXT>
   The annual fall gathering of bald eagles at
Glacier National Park, once a natural wonder that awed thousands,
has disappeared, a victim of man's tinkering with nature.
   While human blunder destroyed the birds' feeding on salmon at
Glacier, 200 miles to the south another attempt to modify nature
has provided a new food source and a new eagle gathering area.
   Just a few years ago, the ark in northwestern Montana was
considered one of the best places in America to view bald eagles in
the fall. Salmon swarmed upstream to spawn in the park's Lake
McDonald, and migrating eagles by the hundreds paused to perch in
trees and feed on fish.
   Tourists jammed viewing areas where it was common to see six of
the threatened birds per tree just 100 feet away.
   But in 1986, the salmon run collapsed after an attempt to
enhance the salmon population backfired.
   A tiny creature called the mysis shrimp was introduced about 20
years ago by the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks into
nearby Flathead Lake, with the idea that it would be a new food
source for the salmon. Instead, the mysis competed for plankton
that salmon eat, and the salmon population dwindled.
   Once there were more than 100,000 spawning salmon in the creek
every fall, park officials say. This fall, there were only about
200.
   As the salmon disappeared, so did the eagles. In 1981, the peak
count was 639 bald eagles in the Lake McDonald area. Last year it
was 25. Last week it was 13.
   The bald eagle's are protected nationwide, except in Alaska,
where populations thrive. Federal officials estimate there were
2,660 nesting pairs in the Lower 48 states last year.
   ``Eagles are opportunistic feeders,'' said Glacier park
spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt. ``If there aren't salmon, they're not
going to hang around. They're going to go where there's food.''
   Riley McClelland, a park research biologist, said many of the
birds still fly over, ``but none of them are stopping. Most of them
are simply passing through.'' The birds are migratory and many are
believed to spend part of the year in Canada and part in Mexico.
   The loss of the eagles has cost the area tourists. McClelland
said 46,500 people used to come and watch the eagles in October and
November. Last year, only 1,000 people visited during the same
period.
   Meanwhile, at Canyon Ferry Reservoir just east of Helena, an
experiment with kokanee salmon also went awry - but with beneficial
results. Salmon stocked for fishermen escaped from the reservoir
and made their way into the Missouri River below, where they began
spawning.
   The booming salmon population has attracted so many eagles that
officials have closed part of the river to protect their nests and
feeding ground. More than 200 bald eagles are there now. Five years
ago, observers say perhaps half a dozen stopped there.
   The new group don't appear to have come from Glacier, McClelland
said. Only a few banded Glacier eagles have shown up at Canyon
Ferry.
   Whatever their origin, the majestic birds attracted tourists as
word of the new gathering spread.
   Pat Gubbins, a regional manager with the state wildlife and
parks department, said more than 600 people have flocked to the
site nearly each weekend this fall, plus hundreds more during the
week.

<HEAD>Arizona Officials Lose Appeal For Immunity From Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that state officials may be sued for shutting down a day-care
center without giving the owner a chance to respond to charges of
child abuse and overcrowding.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Arizona
officials seeking immunity from a lawsuit by a Tucson day-care
center.
   The Arizona Office of Child Protective Services investigated the
Chalkboard Inc. center after Tucson police received a complaint in
1985 that a young girl was sexually abused by a teacher there.
   The investigators said they discovered at least one other
complaint of sexual abuse against the same teacher, learned of
several complaints of physical abuse of the children and found
overcrowding despite an earlier warning to Chalkboard.
   The investigators also said the teacher accused of sexual abuse
had been suspended, and that there was evidence the physical abuse
had been halted two months earlier.
   Within a week of the preliminary investigation and eight days
before a scheduled hearing on the charges, officials suspended
Chalkboard's license to operate.
   The center's owner, Karen Hoyt, sued the state officials for
violating her due-process rights by shutting down the center
without a hearing or a court order.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May refused to kill her
suit. The appeals court rejected arguments by the officials that
they are entitled to immunity because they acted swiftly to protect
the children.
   The appeals court said the officials ignored state law that
required due-process for the day care center in such circumstances.
   ``Arizona has provided procedures ... requiring notice and
hearing in the absence of a showing of actual emergency,'' the
appeals court said ``In ignoring these procedures ... reasonable
officials would have known that their actions were not lawful.''
   The appeals court sent the case back to a lower court for
further proceedings that could lead to an award of monetary damages
against the officials.
   Twenty-two states urged the justices to hear Arizona's appeal
and give state officials broader protection against being sued. The
states are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,
Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming.
   The case is Brandt vs. Chalkboard, 90-270.

<HEAD>Shiite Group Claims Responsibility for Iraqi Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem group has claimed
reponsibility for what it said were violent student protests in
Iraq against Saddam Hussein.
   The statement by the Lebanon branch of the Supreme Council of
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq was published today by the Middle
East Reporter, an English language daily newsletter based in
Beirut.
   The group is believed linked to the Dawa party, an opposition
group formed by Imam Mohammed Baqr Sadr, the Shiite spiritual
leader of Iraq who was executed by Saddam 10 years ago.
   The statement said ``selected units of martyr Sadr's cubs waged
as of November a widespread campaign of resistance against Saddam's
aggressive policies.''
   The campaign included distribution of anti-government leaflets
in schools in Baghdad and the Iraqi cities of Kofa, Basra, Amara,
Kirkuk and Irbil, the statement said. It said the leaflets urged
Iraqi troops to ``rebel against the regime.''
   Iraq's official news agency has referred recently to student
unrest and arrests, but given no details. The statement published
in Beirut was the first to claim responsibility for recent Iraqi
unrest.
   The statement claimed more than 4,500 people, most of them
students, were arrested after ``bloody clashes with knives and
daggers on Nov. 7 and 15 in Baghdad and several other parts of
Iraq.''
   It asked international humanitarian organizations to intervene
to prevent Saddam from executing the detainees, who the statement
said were tortured.
   The Dawa party is Shiite. Saddam is a Sunni Moslem.
   The 17 bombers who were jailed in Kuwait for blowing up the U.S.
and French Embassies in the emirate in 1983 belong to the Dawa
party. Two of the 17 were released last year. There has been no
word on the others' fate following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The release of the bombers has been sought by Shiites holding
most of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon, including six
Americans.

   The Supreme Court today refused to kill an
affirmative action program in Florida aimed at awarding more public
works contracts to businesses run by minorities and women.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by companies that
said the Tampa-area program is unconstitutional because it condones
reverse discrimination against white men.
   The affirmative action program was adopted in 1984 by
Hillsborough County, Fla. The county set a goal of awarding 25
percent of the value of all annual construction contracts to
businesses owned by women and minorities, primarily blacks and
Hispanics.
   The program, in effect, calls for county officials to favor
contractors who have lined up companies run by minorities and women
as subcontractors.
   If the contractor submitting the low bid on a project has met
the county's affirmative action goals, that company is likely to
win the contract. The low bidder may lose the contract if it fails
to convince officials it has at least made a good-faith effort to
meet those goals.
   After a group of white-owned construction companies sued, a
federal judge in 1989 ruled the program was unconstitutional and
barred the county from enforcing it.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the judge last
August and reinstated the program. The appeals court said the
program, at least on its face, does not violate equal-protection
guarantees.
   But the appeals court did not throw out the suit, but instead
sent it back for a trial at which the white-owned companies will
have a chance to prove their allegations.
   The appeals court said the Hillsborough plan appears to be
significantly different from a so-called set-aside program adopted
by Richmond, Va., that was overturned by the Supreme Court last
year.
   The Richmond plan established a quota that required 30 percent
of the value of annual public works contracts to be awarded to
minority businesses.
   In striking down that plan, the high court said local
governments must narrowly tailor affirmative action plans to remedy
proven past bias.
   The 11th Circuit court said Hillsborough County acted only after
a six-year, wholly voluntary plan failed to do enough to help
minorities and women in the building industry.
   ``Unlike Richmond, Hillsborough County decided to implement its
law based on statistics indicating that there was discrimination
specifically in the construction business commissioned by the
county,'' the appeals court said.
   It noted that the county shunned rigid quotas and only adopted
flexible goals for awarding contracts to minorities and women.
   Another plus for the county program is that most of the
contracts are intended to go to struggling, smaller companies, the
appeals court added.
   The companies that challenged the plan said it is designed to
achieve racial balance without proof of past discrimination against
women and minorities in the construction industry.
   The case is Cone Corp. vs. Hillsborough County, 90-587.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Industry Loses Effort to Scuttle Training Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's nuclear power industry today lost
a Supreme Court effort to scuttle anticipated federal rules for the
training of nuclear plant workers.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that forces the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to issue such binding rules.
   Only Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case.
Four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The appeals court said Congress intended to have binding rules
imposed when it enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The
law requires ``regulations or other appropriate commission
regulatory guidance'' for training nuclear power plant workers.
   But lawyers for the nuclear power industry contend the
commission complied with the 1982 law when it issued a ``policy
statement'' in 1985 endorsing the industry's self-improvement
safety program.
   The dispute has its roots in the 1979 accident at the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.
   A presidential commission appointed to investigate the accident
concluded, among other things, that inadequate training of nuclear
plant employees increased the risk of future accidents.
   The nuclear industry created an independent organization to
bring about self-improvement. According to the Nuclear Management
and Resources Council, comprising all utilities holding operating
or construction permits for nuclear plants, the industry spent
``hundreds of millions of dollars to expand and refine ... (the)
training and accreditation program.''
   A coalition of groups sued the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in
1986, seeking to have binding rules imposed on the nuclear
industry's training efforts. The industry's Nuclear Management and
Resources Council was allowed to intervene as a defendant.
   The original lawsuit was dismissed for having been filed too
late.
   But after the commission revised its policy statement in 1988,
the coalition of groups again sued over the commission's failure to
impose binding rules.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
ruled last April that the commission had not complied with the 1982
law's provision for ``regulations or other appropriate regulatory
guidance.''
   The full appeals court later refused to reconsider the April
decision, but several judges noted that the commission could
``devise regulations that preserve most if not all of the
flexibility the commission sought'' in its 1985 policy statement.
   The nuclear industry's council then sought Supreme Court review,
arguing that the appeals court ruling threatens nuclear safety.
   ``This is not a case ... in which an industry is simply
attempting to evade wholesome regulations,'' the appeal said.
``Uniform adherence to the highest safety standards ... must
involve the industry in setting and policing its own standards of
excellence.''
   Lawyers for the coalition of groups that pressed for binding
rules urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   The federal commission, which did not appeal the appeals court
ruling to the Supreme Court, told the justices it did not oppose
the nuclear industry's appeal.
   The case is Nuclear Management and Resources Council vs. Public
Citizen, 90-360.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Retirement Issue for State Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether state judges may be forced to retire at age 70.
   The court said it will hear arguments by two Missouri judges
that their state's mandatory retirement age violates federal law
and unconstitutionally treats them differently than other Missouri
employees.
   The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
March that a federal law banning age discrimination in employment
does not apply to state court judges.
   The appeals court, upholding a ruling by U.S. District Judge
William Hungate, said Missouri's state court judges fall into the
anti-bias law's exception for ``appointees on the policymaking
level.''
   The appeals court also ruled that the state's mandatory
retirement age is constitutional because it is a rational way to
ensure a vigorous and healthy judiciary and to increase
opportunities for younger people to serve as judges.
   The 8th Circuit court's ruling appears to conflict with a
decision announced two months later by the New York-based 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed a 71-year-old state judge
from Vermont to remain on the bench.
   The 2nd Circuit court ruled that appointed state judges are not
``appointees on the policymaking level'' and therefore are
protected by the federal anti-bias law.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Missouri judges Ellis
Gregory Jr. and Anthony Nugent Jr. urged the justices to resolve
the conflicting rulings.
   The Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue, but in 1988 left
intact New York's policy of forcing elected judges to retire at age
70 even though no such mandatory retirement is imposed on appointed
judges in the state.
   Lawyers for Gregory and Nugent contend that forcing judges, and
no other state employees in physically undemanding jobs, to retire
at age 70 violates judges' constitutional right to equal treatment.
   The case is Gregory vs. Ashcroft, 90-50.

<TEXT>
   Don Geronimo Vela, 73, hitched up his
pants a notch, pulled down his cowboy hat and said, ``We are going
to be proud to have President Bush here, but President Bush will be
proud to be in Agualeguas.''
   Welcome, President Bush, to President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's northern Mexico hometown: fiercely regionalist, friendly
and open as the skies it shares with the U.S. southwest.
   Bush was to arrive this afternoon for talks with Salinas and
travel to nearby Monterrey in the evening for more discussions.
   Nearly 5,000 people live in this farming and cattle community of
stone homes. Some are from families that arrived in the mid-1600s.
   The town's name comes from the Gualeguas Indians, one of a few
groups of semi-nomadic tribes that lived in the region when the
Spaniards came.
   The Salinas and Lozano families, the two sides of the
president's lineage, are believed to have settled in Agualeguas
with a group of 12 Spanish families in the late 1700s.
   The large, old one-story Salinas home sits across the street
from Don Geronimo's home. Just around the corner from the main
plaza, the location indicates that the owners were among the town's
first families.
   ``They are good people,'' said Don Geronimo. ``Don Raul (the
president's father) always has been a very decent man, a man of the
people who came here to rest and visit whenever he had a chance,
even when he was a high government official.''
   Raul Salinas served as a senator, congressman and commerce
secretary.
   ``He always brought his children with him. I remember the
president being a rather quiet, shy boy at the time,'' Don Geronimo
said.
   President Salinas was born in Mexico City, but he always comes
back to his family roots and spends long holidays and vacations in
Agualeguas.
   ``We are proud of him,'' said Ernesto Vazquez, who owns a small
grocery story and claims he sells some of the best home-made beef
jerky in northern Mexico.
   ``Someone from a town nearby said the other day Salinas was not
even born here and we should not brag about him, but I think there
is even more merit in the fact that he wants to be from here,''
Vazquez said.
   ``I think the visit here is like when you invite a friend to
your home. Then they go to Monterrey to talk about serious
matters,'' Don Geronimo said.
   ``I am going to sit on my porch and watch it all. I hope
everything goes well. Bush has too many things to worry about now,
but we want him to feel at home here.''
   It will be close. Agualeguas is like a lot of Mexican towns near
the U.S. border that have a constant interchange with their
northern neighbor country.
   ``We understand the United States and we understand Americans,''
said Mauro Martinez, high school teacher and city chronicler.
   Vazquez offered U.S. brand beer at his grocery store, while on
the sidewalks outside his young nephews and nieces, in town on a
short visit, chatted in English.
   Many Agualeguas residents work or live temporarily in the United
States but come home regularly for visits, Martinez said.
   ``They are not unlike the Salinases,'' he said. ``They want to
come back to their roots. It is an emotional thing.

   Only days before a U.N. Security Council vote on
the use of force in the Persian Gulf, the United States has
effectively ended a moratorium on high-level exchanges with China.
   Chinese officials today announced that the United States had
invited a Chinese vice minister of trade to visit next month. He
will be the highest-ranking Chinese to make an official visit to
the United States since the June 1989 crushing of China's democracy
movement.
   Word of the planned visit came as the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
announced that Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will travel to
New York to cast China's vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution
allowing the use of force against Iraq.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell said today the Chinese
government had notified the embassy of Qian's plans to come to New
York for the U.N. vote. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked for
confirmation, did not immediately respond.
   The United States has been engaged in an intensive international
lobbying campaign to win support for the resolution, which would
authorize the use of force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, which it
seized Aug. 2.
   China, as a permanent Security Council member, could veto the
measure. A vote on the resolution is expected sometime this week.
   Bell refused to discuss details of talks between Beijing and
Washington on the resolution. ``We are in regular contact with the
Chinese on a whole range of diplomatic issues,'' he said. ``To my
knowledge, we still don't know how the Chinese are going to
respond'' to a vote on the resolution.
   In keeping with China's longstanding opposition to superpower
intervention in regional issues, Chinese officials have urged
exhaustive efforts for a peaceful solution. They have refused to
say publicly how China will vote on the resolution.
   However, U.S. officials have said they do not expect China or
the Soviet Union, which is also a permanent member of the Security
Council, to block the measure. Moscow also has been reluctant to
allow force.
   China's international standing has improved greatly since the
Persian Gulf crisis began because of Beijing's support for
resolutions against Iraq. This has spurred the Bush
administration's efforts to resume normal relations with China.
   The United States had joined other Western countries and Japan
in imposing sanctions to punish China for its June 1989 army attack
on student-led protesters for democratic reform. Among other
things, the sanctions halted high-level exchanges.
   The forthcoming visit was announced today by the Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. It said its vice minister, Gu
Yongjiang, will visit the United States from Dec. 10-14 at the
invitation of Commerce Department Undersecretary J. Michael Farren.
   Although there was no formal U.S. announcement, by inviting Gu
the Bush administration effectively ends its own moratorium. Gu's
trip falls in the category of those banned since June 1989.
   Japan and the European Community already have sent
ministerial-level officials to Beijing, but Washington has not
announced any such plans.
   Washington had violated its own ban once, when it sent National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to Beijing in November 1989.
   Otherwise, the only high-level contacts since June 1989 have
been at the United Nations and in third countries.
   Secretary of State James A Baker III met Qian in Cairo in early
November, for example. Washington said such meetings were not
covered by the sanction.
   Other sanctions also have eroded. The United States has resumed
import-export bank loans to China, and dropped its opposition to
World Bank loans. The EC and Japan have resumed low-interest
government loans.
   A ban on arms sales remains the only clear-cut Western sanction
against China.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers walked off
their jobs today, responding to an appeal by the opposition trad
union for a general strike aimed at forcing Socialist Premier
Andrei Lukanov to resign.
   There were conflicting reports about the extent of the protest.
But the walkout called by the Podkrepa labor federation was
apparently limited to about 10 percent of the nation's work force
of 4.5 million.
   ``The political tension in this country has reached threatening
dimensions, and its further escalation is impermissible,'' Valentin
Stoyanov, spokesman for President Zhelyu Zhelev, said on Bulgarian
Radio.
   Zhelev called on the Socialists - formerly the Communists - and
the opposition to meet today to negotiate a plan to bring the
Balkan country out of its political and economic crisis.
   Lukanov's government had said the strike would be illegal. The
action started at 6 a.m., but it was unclear how long it would
last.
   Podkrepa announced the strike last week as demands intensified
for the resignation of Lukanov and his former Communist associates.
   Bulgaria's main trade union organization, the Socialist-backed
Confederation of Independent Unions, said Sunday it would not back
the strike. Both unions claim hundreds of thousands of members.
   The opposition alliance in Parliament, the Union of Democratic
Forces, said it would hold a rally Tuesday in support of the
strike.
   Podkrepa, which means support, is a non-active, non-voting
member of the Union of Democratic Forces, to counter Socialist
charges that it is a political organization rather than a trade
union.
   The Socialist Party, successor to the former Communist Party,
won June elections. But the continuing economic decline and
shortages of basic foods and consumer goods have led to growing
demands for Lukanov's resignation and daily protests against the
government.
   Lukanov and his government narrowly survived a no-confidence
vote in parliament on Friday. That capped months of wrangling
between the governing Socialists and the opposition over how to
revive the economy.
   The state news agency BTA, some of whose staff joined today's
strike, said that about half a million people walked off the job.
   Podkrepa's deputy chairman, Toncho Ivanov, said earlier the
strike was strongest among miners and health workers throughout the
country. He claims his union has 350,000 members.
   Podkrepa members were on strike in 30 enterprises in Sofia and
in 40 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city, BTA said. It
quoted Krustyu Krustev, chairman of the Podkrepa national strike
committee.
   Symbolic or full strike actions were in progress in many other
Bulgarian cities, BTA said.
   Deputy Premier Nora Ananieva told Bulgarian radio that ``by and
large,'' economic enterprises were functioning normally, and that
strikes were isolated to individual cities and enterprises.
   She denied reports that a main petrochemical combine in Burgas
on the Black Sea and a metallurgical plant near Sofia were on
strike.
   Rail, air and maritime traffic were working normally, Ananieva
said, adding that with the exception of several bus lines, city
transport in Sofia was also in operation.
   In a television appearance Sunday, the leader of the Podkrepa
trade union, Konstantin Trenchev, said the government must resign
if it cannot achieve a minimum standard of living for its
population.
   In a seprate televised statement, Lukanov warned that a strike
would hurt the economy even more and could lead to further unrest.
   He urged citizens ``not to support the adventurers who, in their
greed for power, are prepared to push Bulgaria onto the fatal path
of civic conflict.''
   ``God won't fill the shops, but the strike will certainly empty
them,'' Lukanov said.
   Many basic foodstuffs are scarce or beingrrationed. An energy
crisis has led to periodic power cuts.

<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman
could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did
little else to help women along.
   For some, it was enough that her political career reached the
heights.
   One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her
7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor
would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a
girl's name.''
   Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once
unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.
``She has broken the mold once and forever,'' Ms. Nicholson said in
an interview.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before studying law,
said she viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman. She
believed the battle for women's rights had been largely won and was
no believer in feminism.
   ``What has it ever done for me?'' she once asked.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to get
involved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.
   Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive
posts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in a
Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lords
from 1981 to 1983.
   ``The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, she
doesn't believe in the advancement of women,'' Clare Short, a Labor
Party lawmaker, said last month.
   Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other
prime minister would have had several women in and out of the
Cabinet.
   ``It's Margaret's fault that the only people standing (to
succeed her) wear trousers,'' Mrs. Currie said last week. Trree men
are vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thus
prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.
   Traditional male attitudes remain strong in Britain, from the
upper-crust, all-male clubs of London to the topless women pictured
daily in the tabloid press.
   Women are paid less than men and are poorly represented in
management jobs and in Parliament.
   However, campaigners for women rights say there are encouraging
signs at the grassroots.
   ``The critical mass of women have entered middle management in
government and business,'' said Lesley Abdela, a founding member of
the 300 Group.
   The group seeks equal representation for women in the 650-seat
House of Commons, which now has 43 female members.
   Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988,
compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became prime
minister. Britain has a higher proportion of working women than
other European Community countries.
   Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues,
she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions for
workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; and
legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.
   But as prime minister, she angered feminists by often
emphasizing women's traditional roles of homemakers and
care-givers.
   Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women's
issues, contends that an ``enormous amount'' has been done for
women during the Thatcher years.
   ``I'm not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting people
who were there just because they were women,'' she said in an
interview. ``Margaret Thatcher is a great meritocrat. She believes
in getting people to succeed on their merits.''
   Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal numbers of
women in the House of Commons, believes Mrs. Thatcher's
extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the
needs of the average woman.
   ``She would say that anybody can do it, just stick to your
principles and get up and do it,'' Ms. Hawkins said. ``I think
because of her character, her personality and her amazing
self-confidence, she isn't aware of how the normal person
struggles.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Consider Curtailing Federal Courts' Review Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to consider
curtailing dramatically the power of federal courts to review
criminal defendants' state court convictions.
   The justices, without comment, turned away a Florida case in
which prosecutors asked them to bar most convicted defendants from
going into federal court with claims that their so-called Miranda
rights were violated.
   In its famous Miranda vs. Arizona decision in 1966, the high
court said criminal suspects in police custody may not be
interrogated unless told of their rights to remain silent, to have
a lawyer's help, and to have a lawyer appointed for them if they
cannot afford one.
   Confessions or other evidence obtained in violation of the
Miranda ruling, which was based on the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination, cannot be used at
trial.
   Florida prosecutors urged the court to rule that defendants
given a full and fair chance in state courts to mount a Miranda
challenge to the use of incriminating evidence be barred from
carrying such challenges to federal courts.
   The court in 1976 shut down such federal court access for
convicted defendants given a fair and full chance in state courts
to challenge evidence allegedly obtained unlawfully by police. The
Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable police searches and seizures.
   Over the past decade, the justices several times declined
invitations to extend the 1976 decision, reached in a case called
Stone vs. Powell, to criminal law areas outside the Fourth
Amendment context.
   But in a 1989 case decided on other grounds, two justices -
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia - voted to extend the ban on
federal court access to such Miranda challenges.
   In the case acted on today, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last April threw out Jack Towne's state court conviction
and the 22-year prison sentence it drew.
   The appeals court ruled that Towne's confessions had been
obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right because police
continued to question Towne without trying to clarify ``an
equivocal request for an attorney.''
   Towne was arrested Dec. 4, 1984, for loitering and prowling at
an apartment complex near his home in Gainesville, Fla.
   At the police station, an officer questioned Towne about several
rapes and burglaries that had occurred recently in the same area.
   After Towne made some incriminating statements, the officer
called in a detective who questioned Towne for an additional three
hours.
   Towne subsequently pleaded ``no contest'' to charges of battery,
sexual battery, armed robbery and armed burglary. But he reserved
his right to appeal a state judge's refusal to suppress his
confessions as evidence.
   After state appeals courts ruled that Towne's confessions were
obtained in compliance with his Miranda rights, he turned to the
federal courts for help.
   A federal trial judge ruled against him, but the 11th Circuit
court threw out his conviction.
   The appeals court noted that at one point Towne said to the
police officer who first questioned him, ``What do you think about
whether I should get a lawyer?''
   ``Questions such as the one posed by Towne are equivocal
requests that require clarification before investigating officers
initiate any further questioning,'' the appeals court ruled.
   The case is Dugger vs. Towne, 90-345.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling On Wisconsin Campaign Finance Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a state may limit how much money a candidate receives from
political committees.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that such a
Wisconsin campaign financing law violates free-speech rights.
   The constitutionality of the law was challenged by John Gard, a
Republican state assemblyman who was fined $500 for violating its
limits in 1987. Other GOP officials in the state joined his
challenge.
   Gard received $18,820 from committees in his campaign that year,
$7,607 over the limit.
   The law places a cap on the total a candidate may receive from
all committees, including political action committees (PACs) run by
special interests and party-related committees.
   Gard and his allies said the law violates the free-speech rights
of committees that may be barred from making even symbolic
contributions to candidates who have reached the limit.
   They also said the law violates the candidate's free-speech
rights by, in effect, limiting the amount of money he or she may
spend.
   The Supreme Court in 1976 upheld federal campaign financing
regulations limiting contributions to candidates. But the high
court struck down provisions restricting campaign expenditures.
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court in June relied heavily on the 1976
ruling in upholding the state law.
   ``There is a compelling state interest in placing an aggregate
limit on the contributions that an individual candidate may receive
from allccommittees,'' the state court said. ``The purpose ... is
to limit the impact of huge special interest contributions on a
candidate and to encourage a broad and diverse base of support in
order to prevent either actual corruption or the appearance of
corruption.''
   The state court said it is necessary to apply the limit to all
committees, not just PACs, to prevent special interests from
``laundering'' contributions by funneling them through
party-related committees.
   ``The aggregate limit encourages candidates to seek
contributions from a greater number of sources and to compel people
who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory
limits to expend such funds on direct political expression,'' the
Wisconsin court said.
   It said laws in at least five other states - Hawaii, Montana,
Arizona, Louisiana and California - impose similar restrictions.
   The case is Gard vs. Wisconsin Elections Board, 90-536.

<HEAD>Former Florida Congressman Loses Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard B. Kelly the former Florida
congressman who served 13 months in prison for his Abscam bribery
conviction in 1981, today lost a Supreme Court appeal in which he
said new evidence shows he was denied a fair trial.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that threw out
Kelly's latest appeal.
   Kelly, now 66 and living in Stevensville, Mont., was one of
seven members of Congress convicted in the FBI's Abscam undercover
operation.
   Kelly represented the Tampa area for three terms but lost a 1980
re-election bid after he was indicted.
   The jury that convicted him had watched a videotape of Kelly
stuffing his pockets with $100 bills given to him by an FBI agent
posing as an aide to a non-existent Arab sheik.
   Kelly said he accepted $25,000 from phony Arabs who said they
had immigration problems because he was conducting his own
investigation of ``shady characters.''
   Kelly was imprisoned from Nov. 1, 1985, to Nov. 28, 1986, at the
minimum-security federal prison camp on Eglin Air Force Base in the
Florida Panhandle and at the Suncoast Rehabilitation Center in St.
Petersburg.
   In the appeal acted on today, Kelly contended that a former FBI
informant, James Davenport, stole key defense documents from his
Capitol Hill office in August 1980 and gave the documents to
federal prosecutors.
   Kelly said the new evidence about Davenport's theft entitles him
to a new trial.
   A federal trial judge and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
previously rejected Kelly's appeal.
   The case is Kelly vs. U.S., 90-682.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge To Customs Agents' Seizure of Magazines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the seizure by U.S. Customs agents of some 2,700 allegedly
obscene magazines shipped from Cleveland and denied entry into
Canada.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that the
magazines could be treated as imports from a foreign country once
they were headed back to Cleveland.
   Trans World News Co. of Cleveland shipped, on three occasions in
1987, some 0,000 magazines to Canada for North American News in
Toronto. About 10,000 of the magazines were rejected at the
Canadian border by officials who deemed them too sexually explicit
and offensive to Canadian standards.
   When those magazines were returned, Customs agents in western
New York seized and confiscated 2,703 of them after determining
they probably were obscene under the standards of that part of the
country.
   The magazines were seized under a federal law banning the import
of obscene materials.
   U.S. District Judge John T. Curtin in Buffalo upheld the seizure
and confiscation despite arguments by Trans World News lawyers that
the magazines were not imports because they never had reached their
Canadian destination.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit upheld Curtin's ruling last July. ``Whether
the magazines were accepted into Canada or denied entry and held by
Canadian Customs is irrelevant,'' the appeals court said.
   It added: ``Regardless of their fate in Canada, the
objectionable publications were presented at the United States
border for entry into the United States from without when they were
seized.''
   The case is 1903 Obscene Magazines vs. U.S., 90-642.

   France is selling weapons - including
Exocet and anti-tank missiles - to the Kuwaiti government-in-exile,
a French newspaper reported today.
   The arms are being shipped to Saudi Arabia from an air base in
France aboard Lebanese aircraft, the daily Nouvelle Republique du
Centre-Ouest said.
   The Defense Ministry would not comment on the report.
   The French news agency Agence-France Presse quoted a source as
saying the shipments were essentially spare parts for French-made
aircraft.
   Kuwait's rulers fled because of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of the
emirate, and set up a government-in-exile in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
Kuwaiti pilots have been training in Saudi Arabia with Saudi and
American forces.
   The Kuwaiti pilots flew 15 Mirage F-1 fighters, 20 A-4 Sky
Hawks, six Hawk trainers and 15 French-made Gazelle helicopters -
about 80 percent of the Kuwait air force's planes - to Saudi
Arabia, officials have said.
   The Nouvelle Republique said the French arms deliveries began
Nov. 6 and include anti-tank Hot missiles and airplane motors.
   Twenty-two flights carrying the arms left the airport at
Chateauroux-Deols, 140 miles southwest of Paris, last week and
three more are scheduled this month, the newspaper quoted sources
as saying.
   The shipments are being carried out under a contract worth $180
million between France and the exiled emir of Kuwait, it quoted the
sources as saying.
   It said the planes belong to Trans Mediterranean Air Cargo
System, the cargo affiliate of Middle East Airlines of Lebanon.
   A spokeswoman for Middle East Airlines in Beirut who identified
herself only as Mrs. Saadeh denied the airline was involved.
   Iraq freed all French nationals in Iraq and Kuwait on Oct. 30,
but Paris has maintained there were no negotiations or conditions
for their release. France has stressed its solidarity with the
U.S.-led multinational force assembled in the Persian Gulf after
the invasion of Kuwait.
   Argentina used a French-made Exocet missile to sink a British
warship during the war over the Falkland Islands. Exocet missiles
were used with less success during the Iran-Iraq war.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate New York Parental Rights Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
New York parental rights law that barred many men from vetoing the
adoptions of their illegitimate children.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by New York's
highest court that the law violated fathers' constitutional rights.
   Until a 1979 ruling by the nation's highest court, fathers of
children born out of wedlock had no parental rights.
   But in a series of decisions since, the court has said an unwed
father may challenge a mother's putting the child up for adoption
if he has ``manifested a significant paternal interest in the
child.''
   Under the invalidated New York law, a ``significant paternal
interest'' had to be proved in three ways:
   -The father had to have lived with the mother or the child
during the six months before the child was placed for adoption.
   -He had to openly acknowledge his fatherhood.
   -He had to have paid for pregnancy and birth expenses.
   In striking down the law last July, the New York Court of
Appeals said, ``The ... requirement that the father openly live
with the mother before a child's placement for adoption neither
legitimately furthers the state's interest nor sufficiently protect
that father's, and (the law) must therefore be declared
unconstitutional.''
   The July ruling cast doubt on the proposed adoption by a Nashua,
N.H., couple of a girl born out of wedlock in White Plains, N.Y.,
two years ago.
   Lower courts had ruled that the adoption could be finalized
without the consent of the child's biological father.
   The little girl, Raquel Marie, was born May 26, 1988, to a woman
identified in court documents only as Louise N. The child's
biological father is identified only as Miguel T.
   When Raquel Marie was 2 months old, her mother consented to the
girl's adoption by the New Hampshire couple, identified as Robert
and Ana C.
   Raquel has lived in Nashua ever since, but in November 1988
Louise N. and Miguel T. reconciled and were married. They opposed
the as-yet completed adoption.
   Louise and Miguel had met while students at Eastchester High
School in the suburban New York City area.
   They had their first child, a girl named Lauren, in 1986, but
the couple lived together only a brief time in 1987. According to
court documents, they had a stormy relationship, and Miguel T. on
several occasions had been so physically abusive that Louise N.
needed medical treatment.
   Since challenging Raquel's adoption, Louise N. and Miguel T.
have separated.
   The case is Robert and Ana C. vs. Miguel T. and Louise N.,
90-597.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Get Involved in Getz Divorce Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to become
involved in a bitter divorce dispute between jazz saxophonist Stan
Getz and his wife of 32 years.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by Monica Getz
that New York's divorce law violates the rights of women.
   Getz, 63, sued for divorce in 1981, after Mrs. Getz, 56, went to
court alleging her husband - suffering from alcoholism and drug
addiction - abused her. She sought a court order for family support
payments and protection against Getz.
   The couple later made attempts at reconciliation before the
divorce became final in 1987. A state jury ruled in Getz's favor in
granting the divorce. He had accused his wife of infidelity and
trying to poison him.
   Mrs. Getz said her husband had been repeatedly unfaithful and
unpredictably violent, but said she stood by him when drugs and
alcohol could have cost him his life.
   A state judge ruled that Mrs. Getz is entitled to half her
husband's royalties from the beginning of their marriage in 1956 to
1981. That ruling was not at issue in the case acted on today.
   In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Getz said the divorce
decree against her is unfair. She said the case should have been
resolved in New York's family courts rather than by trial courts
that handle corporate disputes and other matters.
   She said the state law favors men by permitting them to wage
``legal wars of attrition'' against their wives, who often lack
equal financial resources.
   Family courts are designed to expedite resolutions of divorce
cases and spare the couple excessive legal fees, she said.
   Mrs. Getz said she has spent more than $600,000 in legal fees
and will be forced to use the proceeds from the couple's mansion in
Irvington, N.Y., where she still lives, to pay off the bills.
   In a legal brief in her behalf, Mrs. Getz's lawyer, Whitney
North Seymour Jr., said, ``The wife's entire life has been left in
shambles by this case. She has been branded an adulteress. She has
become obligated to pay legal fees of many hundreds of thousands of
dollars. She is being forced out of her home and to give up her
old-age security.''
   The case is Getz vs. Getz, 90-562.

<HEAD>Torture and Killings Charged in Papua New Guinea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that soldiers and
riot police tortured and killed scores of people on Papua New
Guinea's Bougainville Island during anti-rebel operations in the
past two years.
   The London-based human rights organization warned such
violations could be repeated on a wide scale if the troops and
police in the Pacific island nation are allowed again to take the
law into their own hands.
   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 3.6 million in an area
slightly larger than California, has been an independent member of
the 50-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies since
1975.
   It consists of the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and
nearby islands, including Bougainville.
   Amnesty International said accounts of violations emerged soon
after the government launched a counterinsurgency operation against
the opposition Bougainville Revolutionary Army in early 1989. A
state of emergency was imposed in June of that year.
   ``They bombed and raided more than 40 villages, burning houses,
beating and sexually abusing villagers and killing dozens of
people, including children as young as three months,'' said the
group's 50-page report.
   ``Soldiers killed dozens of unarmed civilians they suspected of
supporting the armed opposition and tortured scores of others,''
before government security forces were withdrawn from Bougainville
in March of this year, the report said.
   The human rights group called for an impartial authority to
investigate the allegations.
   Amnesty International also said the Papua New Guinea government
took few steps to stop or investigate the human rights violations
on Bougainville.
   There were frequent violations during states of emergency
imposed in different parts of the country, which gave sweeping
powers and immunity from prosecution to troops and police, the
report said.
   It said journalists, religious workers, politicians, doctors,
government workers and villagers were among the victims during the
counterinsurgency operation on Bougainville.
   One politician was forced to lick the blood of a slain police
officer; another man was beaten so badly he had to have a leg
amputated and he later died, and a pastor and five of his
congregation were seized on the street, beaten, stripped and shot
to death, the report said.
   It gave details of ill-treatment, torture and killings and
identified a number of victims. The group said it had
well-documented evidence that 19 people died in apparent
extrajudicial executions or after torture.
   The report said its findings were supported by medical records,
autopsy reports, testimony from victims and eyewitnesses, press
accounts and government documents.
   The group said it knew of only one soldier who was brought to
justice for the abuses in the two years since they first became
known.
   Amnesty International campaigns for freedom of non-violent
political prisoners and against torture and capital punishment.
   It was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize.

   One fishing boat sank, two were
abandoned and at least seven other boats were endangered by a
severe winter storm east of the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea,
the Coast Guard said.
   Seas were cresting as high as 45 feet today, and other fishing
boats were standing by to provide assistance.
   ``The weather is still pretty crummy. But there have been no
injuries or deaths. That's phenomenal,'' Petty Officer John Germain
said today.
   The Seattle-based crabber Winter Hawk sank Sunday morning about
150 miles east of the Pribilof island of St. George, said Lt. Sue
Hargis at the Coast Guard's Rescue Coordination Center in Juneau.
   All five crewmen were rescued by other fishing boats, the Coast
Guard said.
   The Shannon Marie, based in Portland, Ore., and the Pisces,
believed to be based in Bellingham, Wash., were abandoned and left
drifting Sunday after 30-foot waves and winds gusting to 90 mph
battered them and other boats fishing for crab between the
Pribilofs and Port Heiden in the Aleutian Islands, about 600 miles
southwest of Anchorage, Coast Guard officials said.
   The Pisces' five crew members and the six crewmen aboard the
Shannon Marie also were rescued, officials said.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today told
a group of Americans visiting Baghdad that they were free to take
their detained relatives home at any time, Baghdad Radio reported.
   The report did not say how many hostages were involved, or give
their names. However, the husband of a Massachusetts woman who is
in Iraq to seek the release of her brother said his release had
been promised.
   Mary Trundy of Brockton, Mass., is in Iraq with her brothers,
Jame Stevenson and Bill Stevenson of Panama City, Fla. Their
brother, John Stevenson, is a computer specialist who worked in
Kuwait for 11 years.
   Mrs. Trundy's husband, Dennis, said Saddam himself had told them
her brother would be released.
   ``She and her two brothers met with Saddam Hussein sometime this
morning and he said `sure, take him,''' said Trundy, who spoke with
his wife by telephone from Massachusetts.
   ``It was getting kind of dragged on there. They didn't know what
was going on. But things moved kind of fast the last day or two,''
he said.
   The Baghdad Radio report, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Saddam as
telling the relatives the United States did not have the right to
appoint itself to police the world, and said Iraq wanted peace and
a solution to the Palestinian conflict.
   A number of Americans are in Baghdad seeking their relatives'
freedom.
   Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash., has a son, Vala Fouroohi,
who is seeking his release. Briton Nigel Nightingale's wife Jean,
an American, also traveled to Baghdad to seek his freedom.

   Iraq today accused the United States of using blackmail to win
U.N. backing for a military strike to free Kuwait, and Saddam
Hussein met relatives of some American hostages and told them their
loved ones were free to go.
   Baghdad Radio, which reported on the meeting between Saddam and
the Americans, did not say how many hostages would be allowed to
leave. The report did not name the hostages or their relatives.
   However, Dennis Trundy of Brockton, Mass., said Saddam promised
to free his brother-in-law, John Stevenson. Trundy's wife and her
two other brothers are in Baghdad and called with the news.
   ``She and her two brothers met with Saddam Hussein sometime this
morning and he said `sure, take him,''' Trundy said.
   Also today, oil prices - which have fluctuated wildly since Iraq
seized the oil-rich emirate - rose about $2 a barrel on the futures
market, as traders speculated the United Nations was about to
authorize the use of force against Iraq.
   By late morning, light sweet crude was up $2.05 at $33.95 on
contracts for delivery in January. Contracts for delivery in later
months were sharply higher.
   The Soviet Union, meanwhile, which has advised patience in
dealing with Iraq, today threatened to take a ``tougher attitude''
because Saddam failed to allow 1,000 Soviets to leave in November.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin spoke at a news
briefing that coincided with a four-hour meeting in Moscow between
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and the Iraqi
foreign minister.
   Churkin said Iraq allowed 350 Soviets to depart this month,
adding:
   ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our
citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even
further and force us to take a tougher attitude.''
   In other developments:
   -The Iraqi parliament voted to free the 58 Swedes remaining in
Iraq, the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad reported. The vote requires
approval from Saddam, the embassy said. Iraq freed more than 100
Germans and 10 Greeks on Sunday. Iraqi officials said 70 Italian
hostages would be allowed to leave Tuesday.
   -Saddam warned that if the U.S.-led force attacks, he will
unleash his missiles on Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf Arab
states.
   -Iraqi authorities took steps Sunday to make sure any shortages
caused by a U.N.-mandated trade embargo are felt in Kuwait. The
official Iraqi News Agency said food rationing would begin soon in
the oil-rich emirate.
   -Kuwait's government-in-exile, citing reports from escapees,
said Kuwaiti resistance fighters recently wounded the
Iraqi-appointed governor of Kuwait. The report could not be
independently confirmed, but Iraq did announce the appointment of a
new governor earlier this month.
   The proposed U.N. resolution authorizing military force against
Iraq unless it withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 1 was circulated as
the Security Council prepared for this week's debate on the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The resolution was given to the other permanent members of the
Security Council - Great Britain, France, Chia and the Soviet
Union. Any one permanent member has the power to block it.
   U.S. officials have said they did not expect the Soviet Union
and China to veto such a resolution, but raised the possibility
they would seek softer language. The Soviets and others who
counseled more diplomacy have urged the Bush administration to be
patient for at least two more months.
   Iraq said the proposed U.N. resolution will not force it to give
up any of the land it seized Aug. 2.
   ``If anybody believes that this newest resolution will influence
our position or force us to abandon our rights, they are completely
wrong,'' the ruling Baath party said in its daily newspaper,
Al-Thawra.
   The newspaper said the United States is using ``terrorism,
threats and blackmail'' to try to win approval of the resolution.
   The United States is seeking a U.N. vote this week because its
one-month presidency of the council ends Friday. Taking over is the
Red Sea state of Yemen, which has supported Iraq in the past.
   The United States wants international legitimacy behind any
military action to liberate Kuwait. It also wants unanimity in
issuing the strongest warning yet to Saddam.

   The Army said today it ordered National Guard
combat units from four states to report for active duty Friday.
They will be the first Army reserve combat forces to be activated
for Operation Desert Shield.
   The reservists are to undergo desert warfare training at Fort
Irwin, Calif., before the Pentagon decides whether to send them to
the front lines in Saudi Arabia.
   An Army announcement being prepared for release by the Defense
Department said Guard combat brigades from Georgia and Louisiana
would be activated Friday, but no mention was made of a Mississippi
Guard brigade that had been expected to get activation orders.
   Besides the 48th Infantry Brigade(Mechanized) of Georgia and
the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana, the Army also
said a battalion of the 152nd Armor of Oneonta, Ala., and the 1st
Battalion, 263rd Armor of Mullins, S.C., were being called to
active duty to support the Persian Gulf operation.
   Those units, plus the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi, were
among National Guard forces alerted Nov. 16 for possible
activation. Last Wednesday the Army said all three combat brigades,
plus three smaller combat units, would be put on active duty soon
but that no firm date had been established.
   An Army spokesman, Maj. Joe Padilla, said he had no immediate
information on why the 155th of Mississippi was not included in the
units ordered to report for duty Friday.
   ``There are no plans to take them off the alert list,'' Padilla
said.
   The Army had said last week that about 5,000 members of the 48th
of Georgia would be put on active duty, along with about 5,500
members of the 256th of Louisiana, 3,700 members of the 155th of
Mississippi and about 900 members of smaller combat units from
Alabama, South Carolina and Texas.
   Today's announcement made no mention of a Texas unit being among
those reporting for duty Friday, and no official estimate of the
total number of forces being activated was immediately available.
   Here are the units ordered to report for duty on Friday:

   Lech Walesa won the first round in
presidential elections but, in a startling upset, Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki was shut out of next month's runoff by a
wealthy, enigmatic emigre.
   Mazowiecki met with his government today to decide whether to
resign, and a secretary in his office said there would be a
decision tonight. She refused to give her name.
   Walesa, the favorite in Sunday's balloting, had 39 percent of
the vote with all 49 provinces reporting.
   The emigre businessman, Stanislaw Tyminski, won 23 percent to
Mazowiecki's 18 percent, according to provincial election
commission results reported by the official PAP news agency. Three
minor candidates split the rest. Turnout was about 60 percent.
   It was a stunning setback for Mazowiecki, the East bloc's first
non-Communist head of government, who during 15 months in office
had spearheaded an economic ``shock therapy'' reform program.
   Mazowiecki survived in office 15 months after becoming the East
bloc's first non-Communist head of government. He had said he would
quit as prime minister and move into political opposition if he
lost the election.
   It was unclear whether he would support his former Solidarity
ally, Walesa, in the runoff.
   Walesa told reporters at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk today
that he is ``hesitating'' about contesting the Dec. 9 runoff with
Tyminski, and said he does not consider him ``a serious man.''
   ``I wouldn't like to run but one has to think over what is good
for Poland,'' Walesa said. ``For the last 10 years, I was at the
helm of Polish reforms. There were victims and sacrifices and it
wouldn't be proper to leave it now.''
   The election, Poland's first popular presidential vote, was the
first in Eastern Europe to focus not on defeating communism but on
choosing between visions for the post-Communist future.
   The new president will take over from Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
who ordered martial law to crush Solidarity and imprisoned Walesa
and Mazowiecki in December 1981. Jaruzelski is retiring early to
complete the democratic transformation. The new president will be
elected to a five-year term.
   Tyminski, a 42-year-old virtual political unknown, returned to
his homeland this fall after 21 years in Canada and Peru.
   He apparently impressed Poles worn by economic hardship and the
political scrap that split Solidarity. The free-spending head of
the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada has promised Poles a quick
cure for their economic woes and accused the government of
incompetence.
   Tyminski was confident today.
   ``I will win these elections,'' he said as he arrived at his
headquarters. ``I want to want to make this country rich and
prosperous. ... It will be better within a month.''
   He said he knows ``people in Warsaw who are already dying of
poverty and hunger'' and offered to provide addresses when
challenged by reporters.
   Walesa, a shipyard electrician who as Solidarity leader
marshaled the forces that ended four decades of Communist rule, has
said it would be ``horrible'' to face Tyminski in a runoff.
   He has described the emigre as ``a man straight from the bush,''
an apparent reference the challenger's experiences in Peru's
interior.
   In the country's largest newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, commentator
Piotr Pacewicz attributed Tyminski's showing to ``a second Poland''
of disaffected rural and small-town voters. He said Tyminski
backers were enticed by this man ``who arrived `clean,' from
outside the situation ... who came from the world of success, from
the Americas.''
   An exit poll by state television indicated that farmers, who
represent 40 percent of Polish society, deserted Mazowiecki en
masse, angry at the abolition of guaranteed prices for their
produce. Mazowiecki also fared poorly among workers, winning only
among intellectuals.
   Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a pro-Mazowiecki senator, compared
Tyminski to ``pseudo-medical swindlers ... People trust them, and
not the real medicine.'' Mazowiecki was a longtime adviser to
Walesa, who last year tapped Mazowiecki to become head of the
government. But they had a bitter falling-out, and the voting
climaxed an often acrimonious campaign that splintered Solidarity.
   The charismatic Walesa, 47, had contended that Mazowiecki was
too slow in his reforms and called for ridding the government and
industry of Communists.
   Mazowiecki, who has cautioned against ``witch hunts,'' accused
Walesa of destabilizing the country. The 63-year-old prime minister
argued that Poland needs his team to stay and finish the job
through consistent, gradual change.
   He has accused Walesa of making promises he cannot keep, and
some of his backers say Walesa would be a demagogue.
   Ernest Skalski, a pro-Mazowiecki newspaper editor, predicted
Walesa would beat Tyminski handily, but called his strong showing
``a shameful episode in our political history.''
   It was the first time that Poles voted for a president by
popular election. In the past, both under Communist rule and before
World War II, presidents were elected by the Parliament.
   The new president will be head of state and commander of the
military, with powers to nominate the prime minister, dissolve
parliament and declare a state of emergency under strictly defined
circumstances.
   However, the president's powers will be redefined and possibly
strengthened in a new constitution expected next year, when new
parliamentary elections are also due.
   The lower house of the current parliament has a large proportion
of former Communists, who were seated last year as part of the
political deal through which the long-ruling party ended up ceding
power to Solidarity.

   Iraq accused the United States on Monday of using blackmail to
win U.N. backing for a military strike to free Kuwait and said it

not force it to give up any of the land it seized Aug. 2.
   ``If anybody believes that this newest resolution will influence

Al-Thawra.

<HEAD>Taking Care of Your Eyes Can Prevent Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. T. Franklin Williams</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Poor eyesight does not ``just happen'' with
age. Most older people maintain good eyesight into their 80s and
beyond. However, some physical changes occur during normal aging
that can cause vision to decline gradually.
   Because many eye diseases have no early noticeable symptoms, you
should have an examination every two or three years. A complete
exam includes an evaluation of vision and glasses, an eye muscle
check, a glaucoma check, and a thorough examination of the
light-sensing nerve tissue that lines tha back of the eye, the
retina.
   If you have diabetes or a family history of eye disease, you
should have a thorough eye exam each year. If you experience eye
pain, excessive discharge from your eye, dry eyes, double vision, a
loss or dimming of vision, or swelling of the eye or eyelid, you
should make an appointment immediately.
   Sight-saving treatment is available for those eye diseases that
are related to aging, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related
macular degeneration.
   Cataracts are cloudy or opaque areas in the eye's lens, which is
normally clear. They affect vision by preventing light from passing
through the lens.
   The most common form of cataract is related to aging, although
this type can occur at age 50 or earlier. It usually develops
gradually, without pain, redness, or tearing in the eye.
   If a cataract remains small, it may not affect vision. But if it
becomes large or dense, it can be surgically removed before it
impairs vision and hampers normal activity. Cataract surgery is a
safe procedure and almost always successful.
   Glaucoma is essentially a plumbing problem in the eye. It occurs
when the fluid in the eyeball drains too slowly. Without early
detection and prompt treatment, the fluid build-up causes pressure
inside the eye to rise. The result is internal eye damage and a
gradual loss of vision.
   Glaucoma has no early symptoms. Treatment includes special
eyedrops, oral medications, laser treatments, or in some cases,
surgery.
   Regular eye exams are important for people whose risk of
glaucoma is higher than average. This includes everyone over 40,
because glaucoma usually begins in middle age or later.
   Although scientists do not know why aging makes a person more
susceptible to glaucoma, it is clear that risk increases. Those at
higher risk also include blacks, people with diabetes or high blood
pressure, and people with a family history of glaucoma.
   Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a condition in
which the macula loses its ability to function efficiently. The
macula is the part of the retina that is responsible for sharp
straight-ahead and reading vision.
   Warning signs include blurred vision, a distortion or loss of
central vision (You may see a dark spot in the center of your field
of vision.), and distortion in vertical lines. Early detection is
important because some cases may be treated successfully with laser
surgery.
   Other disorders of the retina are diabetic retinopathy, a
possible complication of diabetes, and retinal detachment.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Fair-Trial Issue in Michigan Sexual Assault Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide how
far states can go to shield victims of sexual assaults from unfair
treatment without violating defendants' fair-trial rights.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Michigan officials
seeking to reinstate the conviction of Nolan K. Lucas, charged with
forcing his former girlfriend to have sex with him.
   At issue is whether evidence of the couple's past sexual conduct
may be barred from the trial because Lucas failed to notify
prosecutors 10 days before the trial began that he would seek to
introduce such evidence.
   Lucas was convicted by a judge of criminal sexual conduct and
sentenced to a prison term of 3 years 8 months to 15 years.
   His former girlfriend said Lucas forced her at knifepoint to
have sex with him on Aug. 31, 1984, two weeks after they broke up.
   He said she consented to have sex with him and noted that she
did not leave his home until late in the evening of the following
day.
   On the opening day of the trial, a lawyer for Lucas sought to
admit evidence of the couple's past sexual conduct.
   The judge refused to allow the evidence on grounds Lucas failed
to comply with the state's rape shield law requiring 10 days
advance warning for the prosecutors.
   The Michigan Court of Appeals threw out the conviction, ruling
that Lucas's constitutional right to confront his accuser was
violated.
   The state court said the trial came down to who was telling the
truth - the defendant or his former girlfriend. In such a case, the
state court said, a defendant should not be barred automatically
from introducing evidence of past sexual conduct.
   The state court noted that the rape shield law permits the judge
to question witnesses and review such evidence in private before
deciding whether it should be aired in open court. The judge has
the opportunity to decide whether the evidence is relevant and
whether it would unfairly prejudice a woman who accused someone of
rape, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also said the 10-day notification requirement
is designed to give prosecutors enough time to investigate a
defendant's claim.
   For example, it would allow them to question alibi witnesses in
advance of a trial or determine the validity of an insanity claim
by the defendant.
   In the case of past sexual conduct between two people, the state
court said, there are no other witnesses that have to be questioned
and little reason to give prosecutors extra time to prepare.
   Michigan prosecutors said similar notification provisions have
been upheld in other states.
   The case is Michigan vs. Lucas, 90-149.

   Villagers armed with bows and arrows

   About 3,000 villagers trapped the elephants in a field, and
police used batons to stop some of them from trying to kill the
beasts, the Banglar Bani newspaper reported.
   It said the elephants crossed into Bangladesh from India
Saturday along the northern Sherpur frontier, killing two farmers
and destroying crops in the hilly, forested area.
   The elephants finally were stopped about 20 miles from the
border at Batateguria, a village 100 miles from Dhaka, the
newspaper reported.
   Government officials urged the villagers not to harm the
elephants and said they would be caught and sent to a zoo, the

   A 12-year-old girl was found dead
hanging from a towel rod hours after seeing a television report
about a boy who committed suicide because he was harassed by
hoodlums, police said Monday.
   Police said an investigation was under way, but that they

Sunday, hanging from a towel rod in the bathroom with a towel
wrapped around her neck, police said.
   ``I watched television last night,'' fifth-grader Kang Chi-hyun

   Many Koreans were shocked by reports of the 11-year-old boy's
death. He jumped from his apartment last week after telling his
mother he was frightened to go to school because of crime.
   President Roh Tae-wool recently declared a war on crime, and
police have begun a major crackdown on criminals and illegal

<HEAD>Security Council Agrees of Draft Peace Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council have forged a draft peace accord aimed at settling
Cambodia's civil war, bolstering chances for an end to 12 years of
fighting, officials said Monday.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, France and
Indonesia, co-chairmen with France of the Paris Conference on
Cambodia, urged the warring factions to resolve their differences.
   ``This was an important step forward in the process of a
political settlement,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Solomon, U.S. representative to the talks.
   In three days of talks, ending late Sunday, the six nations
agreed to a ``draft comprehensive political settlement'' to the
Cambodian conflict. It paves the way for the reconvening of the
Paris Conference on Cambodia, which recessed in failure in
September 1989.
   A senior U.S. official suggested the Paris conference could be
reconvened ``in the next several months.''
   ``We've established the basis for moving forward, and this is
one-half of it,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The Cambodians are the other half of the process.''
   He said the Paris conference could ``go forward to its
conclusion only if there is a functioning Supreme National
Council.''
   Divisions between the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and
the three-party resistance coalition center mainly on the
composition of the Supreme National Council, formed in September at
talks in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   Hun Sen objects to coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk's
bid to head the body, which would be titular head of the nation
until free elections are called. Under the peace plan, the United
Nations would administer Cambodia during the period of transition,
taking over key ministries.
   Sihanouk has proposed making Hun Sen vice-chairman of the
national council, but his main coalition partner, the dreaded Khmer
Rouge, objects.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, and Sihanouk's refusal to
disavow them, have been the main stumbling block to a settlement of
the conflict, which started when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in
December 1978 to topple them from a three-year reign of terror.
   Sihanouk, following a meeting Sunday with Solomon, urged all
four Cambodian factions to meet as soon as possible in Paris to
resolve their differences. There was no immediate word on whether
such a meeting would occur.
   The other members of the coalition are the non-Communist Son
Sann and Sihanouk's party, led by his son Prince Rannaridh.
   The statement by the five permanent Security Council members
said they would welcome the election of Prince Sihanouk to head the
Supreme National Council, but that Cambodians themselves must work
out a formula for its eventual composition.
   Hun Sen also has objected to the vast U.N. role planned for the
country.
   ``None of us doubts that there do remain significant
difficulties,'' the U.S. official said. But there is now a
``permanent momentum'' to the peace process, underscored by the
cooperation among the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, several of whom have a direct stake in Cambodia.
   ``Phnom Penh's friends are going along with the consensus,'' the
official said, indicating that the Hun Sen government could be
forced to back down on its objections or demands.
   The draft settlement is based on the framework agreement of
August 1990, endorsed by the Security Council and the U.N. General
Assembly.
   It contains a draft agreement covering major aspects of the
settlement, according to the statement by the five, as well as five
appendices dealing with the U.N. role, a cease-fire and withdrawal
of foreign forces, elections, repatriation of Cambodian refugees
and principles for a new constitution.
   The five also set out a draft agreement on the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia
and a draft declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction of the
nation.

   Troop numbers aren't the only
thing escalating in the desert. The Christmas crush of mail has
arrived, and postal workers are braced for a flood of holiday
packages.
   ``The Christmas rush is here. It's been non-stop since
Thanksgiving,'' said Cpl. Calvin Williams, 23, of Montgomery, Ala.,
a member of the Alabama National Guard 1241st Postal Unit.
   The raw numbers are staggering for the letters, cards, care
packages, bottles of water, cookies, elementary school projects,
banners and Brooklyn bagels coming from the United States.
   Until now, the Army had been averaging 125 tons of mail sent
from home each day, - about 2.5 times the volume from a month ago.
   On Sunday, a single-day record of 211 tons was unloaded. And in
the next few weeks, officials expect a peak of 400 tons of mail per
day - enough to fill three wide body commercial jets - just for the
Army. Add in the mail for the Air Force, Navy and Marines and that
number will about double.
   ``We never imagined these kinds of numbers. We say we have
Christmas every day,'' said Lt. Col. Fred Nichols of Atlanta,
deputy commander of the organization that handles the Army's mail.
   How much mail is it? Well, the U.S. Postal Service in Newark,
N.J., handles 800,000 pounds of mail a month with 800 workers,
Nichols said. The Army moves that much in a week with 300 soldiers,
now working 12-hour shifts in a 24-hour operation. Some even worked
on Thanksgiving.
   At the post office here, bundles of mail are stacked on a
loading dock. Many have stickers featuring jolly Santa Claus
figures or tags that said ``Do not open until Christmas.'' Convoys
of 40-foot trucks are backed up, and some trucks make three trips
daily to the troops.
   Mail is the link, however tenuous, that connects the troops with
home. It is especially important at Christmas.
   ``It's really the only contact we have with our families. From
the generals on down to the lowest private, mail is the lifeblood
of the morale system,'' Nichols said.
   ``It's like a drink of water for somebody who's been out in the
desert for 10 days,'' said Sp. Judith Huffman of Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, who works in the post office. ``If the troops didn't have
their mail, they'd go bonkers.''
   The troops here have received nearly 10 million pounds of mail
since being deployed in August as part of Operating Desert Shield.
They've sent home about 800,000 pounds.
   Among the items going back are prayer rugs, gold jewelry,
blankets, trinkets, video tapes, cassette tapes and snapshots.
   They are also sending home the most plentiful Saudi souvenir
there is - sand. Sand is never more than a reach away, and the
granules are stuck into envelopes, much to the chagrin of postal
officials.
   ``We would like to discourage that as much as possible. It tends
to leak out the envelopes and foul up the automated sorting
equipment back in the states,'' Nichols said.
   For more conventional gifts, a canvas tent called Cindy's Saudi
Store just behind the military post office offers rugs and
knickknacks.
   There's also a trailer for the Army and Air Force Exchange
Service, a computerized shopping network that allows GIs to pick
gifts from a catalog and ship them to loved ones back home.
   ``Being away from family and being away from friends, depression
can set in,'' said Maj. Willie Newson of the Army's postal
directorate. ``Christmas is an especially important time of year
for mail.''

<HEAD>Homosexual Couple Seek DC Marriage License in Court Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homosexual couple sued the District of
Columbia Monday, contending the city had discriminated against them
by refusing to approve their request for a marriage license.
   ``We demand the right to marry, and we demand the same legal
rights and protections of our relationship that are freely given to
people in heterosexual relationships,'' said Craig R. Dean, a
lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of himself and Patrick G. Gill.
``We are outraged by this blatant act of discrimination.''
   Currently, no state or locality in America allows same-sex
marriages, said William Rubenstein, director of the Gay and Lesbian
Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``There were several lawsuits of this nature that were rejected
back in the early 1970s,'' Rubenstein said in a telephone interview
from his New York office.
   Frederick B. Beane, clerk of the city's superior court, denied
the couple's application for a marriage license last week on
grounds that ``the sections of the District of Columbia Code
governing marriage do not authorize marriage between persons of the
same sex.''
   However, Dean and Gill contend that city law explicitly
prohibits only polygamists and practitioners of incest from
obtaining marriage licenses, and does not require a couple to be of
different sexes to wed.
   In addition, homosexuals are protected from discrimination under
the city's human rights act.
   ``The clerk of the court saw fit to deny us the marriage license
because we are gay,'' Dean said. ``He saw fit to devalue and
degrade our love and the very nature of our relationship.''
   The lawsuit asks Superior Court Judge Geoffrey M. Alprin to
order Beane to grant the couple the marriage license.
   Dean and Gill are also seeking $250,000 in compensatory damages
and $1 million in punitive damages.
   ``With punitive damages ... we want to be able to make a
statement that the clerk ... will not deny marriage licenses to gay
people again,'' Dean said.
   However, both men denied that their primary concern was setting
a legal precedent.
   ``We love each other,'' Gill said. ``We are here in an attempt
to formalize our relationship.''
   Beane has 20 days to respond to the lawsuit.
   Neither Beane nor Claude Bailey, a spokesman for the city's
corporation counsel, was immediately available for comment.

<HEAD>Court to Study Relationship of Bankruptcy Law and Divorce
Settlements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to study the
relationship of federal bankruptcy law and divorce settlements. It
will review a ruling one judge said makes bankruptcy law ``a tool
by which bounders defraud their spouses.''
   The justices said they will decide in a Wisconsin case whether
divorced people awarded ownership of the family home may use
federal bankruptcy law to avoid their ex-spouses' corresponding
award of a lien against the home.
   The court's decision, expected by July, ``will affect many of
the 1.2 million divorces granted every year in this country,'' the
justices were told.
   When state divorce courts divide marital property, they commonly
award one of the spouses sole ownership of the family home and the
other spouse property of equal value.
   But if there are few assets to offset the worth of the family
home, divorce courts often order the spouse awarded the home to
make cash payments to the ex-spouse to balance the scale. A lien is
imposed on the house to secure those payments.
   That is what happened when Gerald Sanderfoot and Jeanne Farrey
were divorced in 1986 after a 20-year marriage.
   Sanderfoot was awarded ownership of the couple's home in
Hortonville, Wis., but was ordered to make cash payments to Ms.
Farrey.
   Three months after the divorce judgment, Sanderfoot filed for
bankruptcy and sought to have the lien against his home nullified.
   A bankruptcy judge refused but a federal trial judge agreed that
the judicial lien against Sanderfoot's home could not be enforced
once he filed for bankruptcy.
   Ms. Farrey appealed, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last March agreed that federal bankruptcy law treats such divorce
judgment liens as it does other judicial liens - it allows them to
be avoided.
   Other federal appeals courts have reached conflicting rulings,
stating that such divorce judgment liens cannot be avoided.
   Dissenting from the 2-1 ruling in March, Judge Richard Posner
called the result ``a perversion of bankruptcy law.''
   ``The bankruptcy code as liberalized in 1978 is widely
criticized as making bankruptcy an ordinary tool of business
planning, but after today it will also be criticized as a tool by
which bounders defraud their spouses,'' Posner said. ``When a
debtor uses the code to steal from his former wife we should not
lightly conclude that the code, properly read, commands such a
result.''
   The case is Farrey vs. Sanderfoot, 90-350.

   The Supreme Court today let stand New York
City's ban on poor and homeless people begging for money in the
city's subways.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the
city's ban on ``begging and panhandling'' throughout the subway
system violates free-speech rights.
   Today's action carries no direct impact for other cities with
similar policies. The action, merely a denial of review, sets no
national legal precedent.
   In other action, the court:
   - Agreed to decide how far states can go to shield victims of
sexual assaults from unfair treatment without violating defendants'
fair-trial rights.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Michigan officials
seeking to reinstate the conviction of Nolan K. Lucas, charged with
forcing his former girlfriend to have sex with him.
   At issue is whether evidence of the couple's past sexual conduct
may be barred from the trial because Lucas failed to notify
prosecutors 10 days before the trial began that he would seek to
introduce such evidence.
   - Agreed to study the relationship of federal bankruptcy law and
divorce settlements. It voted to review a ruling one judge said
makes bankruptcy law ``a tool by which bounders defraud their
spouses.''
   The justices said they will decide in a Wisconsin case whether
divorced people awarded ownership of the family home may use
federal bankruptcy law to avoid their ex-spouses' corresponding
award of a lien against the home.
   - Agreed to decide whether state judges may be forced to retire
at age 70.
   The court said it will hear arguments by two Missouri judges
that their state's mandatory retirement age violates federal law
and unconstitutionally treats them differently than other Missouri
employees.
   - Refused to kill an affirmative action program in Florida aimed
at awarding more public works contracts to businesses run by
minorities and women.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by companies that
said the Tampa-area program is unconstitutional because it condones
reverse discrimination against white men.
   - Refused to kill two fair-housing lawsuits that stem from
newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models
posing as homeowners.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that forces
developers of a Virginia condominium community to defend themselves
in a jury trial against allegations they violated federal laws.
   - Let stand a ruling that state officials may be sued for
shutting down a day-care center without giving the owner a chance
to respond to charges of child abuse and overcrowding.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Arizona
officials seeking immunity from a lawsuit by a Tucson day-care
center.
   - Turned down a bid by the nation's nuclear power industry to
scuttle anticipated federal rules for the training of nuclear plant
workers.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that forces the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to issue such binding rules.
   - Agreed to review one aspect of a long legal battle in which
animal rights groups are seeking to save four monkeys used for
medical research.
   The justices said they will decide whether a federal agency may
transfer the groups' lawsuit from state to federal court.
   - Let stand a ruling that a state may limit how much money a
candidate may receive from political committees.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that such a
Wisconsin campaign-financing law violates free-speech rights.
   The high court in 1980 ruled that the free-speech protections of
the Constitution's First Amendment extend to people who go
door-to-door soliciting money for charities.
   But the justices never have ruled that soliciting for one's own
needs is constitutionally protected.
   That is just what a federal judge in New York ruled last
January. U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand struck down the ban
imposed by the city's transit authority. ``While often disturbing
and sometimes alarmingly graphic, begging is unmistakably
informative and persuasive speech,'' he ruled.
   Sand said the transit authority could limit where and when
begging is allowed and regulate beggars' conduct, but could not
impose a flat ban.
   Referring to the Supreme Court's 1980 ruling, Sand said, ``A
meaningful distinction cannot be drawn for First Amendment purposes
between solicitations for charity and begging.''
   The city's subway system does not ban ``solicitation for
charitable, religious or political causes.''
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Sand's ruling by
a 2-1 vote in May and reinstated the ban on begging.
   ``Even if begging and panhandling constitute protected
expressive conduct, which is in serious doubt, we hold that the
regulation at issue ... is not in violation of the First
Amendment,'' the appeals court wrote.
   The appeals court said Sand's ruling ``reflects an exacerbated
deference to the alleged individual rights of beggars and
panhandlers to the great detriment of the common good.''
   The appeals court pointed to evidence that subway passengers
find begging, unlike soliciting by organized charities, to be
intimidating and threatening. ``The difference must be examined not
from the imaginary heights of Mount Olympus but from the very real
context of the New York City subway,'' it said.
   In the appeal acted on today, advocates for poor and homeless
people urged the justices to rule that ``begging is speech'' and
should be accorded some legal protections.
   ``An individual who represents a charity that the (transit
authority) has approved for solicitation may place a cup at her
feet on subway facilities and hold a sign that says `help the
homeless', but if the individual acts on her own, and the sign says
`help me, I'm homeless' she will be subject to arrest,'' the appeal
said.
   ``If this court does not act promptly to protect First Amendment
rights the court of appeals refused to recognize, the poorest
members of our society will be subject to further assaults on their
dignity as human beings,'' the justices were told.
   Lawyers for the city's subway system urged the court to reject
the appeal, contending that the ban is a reasonable regulation
governing the time, place and manner'' of individual solicitations.
   New York's subway system, encompassing 468 stations and 648
miles of track, serves about 3.5 million passengers each workday.
It operates seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
   The case is Young vs. New York City Transit Authority, 90-591.

<TEXT>
   President Bush began a two-day visit
to Mexico to advance the two nations' goal of enacting an open
trading policy across their border.
   Bush's itinerary today called for consultations with President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on trade and other U.S.-Mexico issues.
The trip marks a shift of hemispheric focus three days after Bush's
return from a Thanksgiving trip to the Middle East.
   Salinas was welcoming Bush to his hometown of Agualeguas and
taking him to a rodeo before hosting him for lunch and talks at
Salinas' family residence.
   Tuesday's schedule calls for the two to meet in Monterrey, 55
miles from Agualeguas and the prosperous industrial capital of
Mexico, where Bush will address Mexican business leaders.
   The principle focus of the sixth meeting between Bush and
Salinas is the drive for a free trade agreement, similar to one the
United States completed with Canada in 1988.
   Mexico and the United States are committed to achieving a free
trade pact. Both countries stand to reap financial benefits,
although some sectors of the Mexican economy are resisting the idea
of competing with their industrial giant neighbors.
   Hesitation also comes from some U.S. sectors. Labor groups raise
concerns that U.S. jobs will go across the border because of the
drastically lower wage scale there. A U.S. government study shows
the average hourly wage at foreign-operated assembly plants on the
Mexican side of the border is $1.63 compared with $14.32 in the
United States.
   The two countries have begun informal talks, and the Bush
administration has asked Congress to provide the necessary approval
early next year so formal negotiations can begin.
   Administration officials say a pact could be settled by early
1992.
   ``We have made a commitment to a free trade agreement with
Mexico. We want to do it as soon as possible,'' Bush told the
Mexican government news agency Notimex in an interview last week.
   Mexico wants any free trade agreement to make it easer for
Mexicans to enter the United States, and the two presidents may
take up the sensitive issue of treatment of Mexicans who cross into
the United States to find work.
   U.S. officials said officials also are considering bringing
Canada into the talks for a trilateral free trade pact.
   Bush, who will visit five South American countries on a separate
trip next week, is counting on Mexico and other Latin nations to
keep hemispheric solidarity in the face of the deteriorating trade
talks with European nations that go into final negotiations next
week.
   The so-called General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks are
in danger of collapsing because of European nations' refusal to
relinquish their farm subsidies.
   With the Persian Gulf crisis dominating the world scene, Mexico
has joined the U.S. bandwagon against Iraq by increasing its oil
exports to make up for the loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. Mexico
has boosted its production by 100,000 barrels a day for export to
the United States.
   ``That was a very welcome and constructive contribution, not
just to the United States, but to all the countries in the world
who are affected by the current runup in oil prices,'' Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs,
said last week.
   Any discussion on the issue of drugs was not expected to be in
depth.
   Mexican officials say their cooperation on the drug problem is
at least as good as it ever has been, but U.S. officials have
stated concerns about increased shipments of Colombian cocaine
through Mexico. Mexico is the largest foreign source of marijuana
sold in the United States and one of the largest sources of heroin.
   A new State Department report said there has been a significant
increase in drug enforcement activities by Mexican authorities over
the past two years, although corruption continues to be a problem.

   The Bush administration is ready to ask the
United Nations Security Council to approve military force to
liberate Kuwait unless Iraq withdraws its troops by Jan. 1, U.S.
officials say.
   The proposed resolution was circulated as the council prepared
for today's start of a week-long debate on the Persian Gulf crisis.
If adopted, it would mark the strongest step taken by the council
since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded his oil-rich neighbor
Aug. 2.
   The Jan. 1 deadline ``is not locked in concrete,'' a U.S.
official told The Associated Press Sunday night. This leaves room
for more maneuvering as the Bush administration tries to maintain
an international alliance against the invasion amid Soviet
reservations about using military force without trying further
diplomacy.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had demanded the Iraqi
invaders leave Kuwait by the end of the year. ``We've just kind of
formalized it'' in the proposed resolution, he said.
   The resolution was circulated among the other permanent members
of the Security Council - Great Britain, France, China and the
Soviet Union - all of which have the power to block it.
   Officials of all five delegations held a strategy session today
hosted by the Chinese delegation, diplomatic sources said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today he was
hopeful the U.N. would approve the resolution on military force.
``We're very optimistic,'' he said.
   Speaking to reporters accompanying President Bush on a flight to
Mexico, Fitzwater indicated the administration wants a deadline for
Saddam's pullout from Kuwait. ``We think there's some value to have
a date certain. But we don't want a specific date because it's
still subject to negotiation,'' he added.
   Fitzwater declined to say, however, whether any deadline was
included in the draft U.N. resolution.
   ``We want Saddam Hussein to know what we're talking about, how
long he has to act,'' the spokesman said. ``And to take some of the
uncertainty out of the situation.'' Fitzwater also said if the
resolution is passed, ``we hope he'll pull out immediately.''
   The proposed U.S. resolution would refer to force indirectly by
saying that if Iraq did not pull its forces out of Kuwait, ``all
necessary means'' would be used to get them out, a U.S. official
said.
   Bush, leaving the White House this morning for the two-day visit
to Mexico, gave a jaunty thumbs up when asked if he had the votes
in the U.N. to win support of the resolution.
   U.S. officials have said they did not expect the Soviet Union
and China to block a resolution on force, but raised the
possibility they would seek softer language than the United States
prefers. Britain and France were expected to back a resolution
authorizing force.
   The Soviets and others who counseled more diplomacy have urged
the Bush administration to be patient for at least two more months.
   Another administration official, who also asked not to be
identified by name, said the draft amounts to a compromise that
Baker expects to be adopted by Thursday - one not authorizing
immediate action, but allowing action sooner than the two months
suggested by the Soviets.
   The United States yields its presidency of the Security Council
on Friday. Yemen, which objects to threatening Iraq with force,
takes over the leadership the following day.
   The president of Yemen said in an interview published in today's
editions of The Washington Post that United Nations backing for
force would be ``a very dangerous development that would threaten
the entire region.''
   ``It is still possible to find a peaceful solution for the
complete withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait and all foreign
forces from the region,'' Ali Abdallah Salih said in the interview,
conducted in Sanaa, Yemen.
   Baker will lead the U.S. delegation in the Security Council,
which is hearing first from Kuwait's ousted rulers presenting their
case against Saddam.
   Most, if not all, of the 15 nations on the Security Council will
be represented in the debate by their foreign ministers. This will
give Baker the chance to coordinate closely with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The two have cooperated on the resolutions adopted by the
council since the invasion, including a worldwide ban on trade with
Iraq.
   The Bush administration is determined to keep the Soviets on
board in order to maintain the makeshift alliance against Iraq that
also includes major Arab and European countries.
   Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser,
said earlier Sunday in Washington there was a ``common feeling''
among members of the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq and the U.N.
General Assembly that the Persian Gulf crisis must be brought to an
end.
   Although the United States has labored to put together a strong
alliance against Saddam, United Nations approval is not necessary
to legitimize any American action against Baghdad, Scowcroft said
on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Bush made a similar pronouncement Friday, saying ``We have the
authority to do what we have to do'' against Saddam, regardless of
a U.N. vote.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation'' program, said one hazard was that the coalition against
Iraq could fall apart before U.N.-imposed economic sanctions
succeed in forcing Saddam out of Kuwait.
   Many countries, particularly Arab nations such as Jordan, Turkey
and Egypt, are paying a high economic price for cutting off all
ties with Iraq, Cheney said.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in
an interview in advance of President Bush's arrival for two days of
economic talks, accused the United States of engaging in trade
protectionism.
   ``Today American products can enter the Mexican market without
restriction, but ours are detained at customs and there are always
many restrictions,'' Salinas said in the Monterrey daily El Norte
Monday.
   Salinas and President George Bush were scheduled to hold two
days of talks Monday and Tuesday focusing on a free trade
agreement.
   Salinas said the United States has adopted protectionist
attitudes in agricultural and fishing product trade, especially
with a recession looming in the background.
   Mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the
United States on the grounds that they don't meet quality
standards. Those bans are seen in Mexico as the manipulation of
regulations engineered by small U.S. lobbies.
   A recent ban on Mexican tuna, which environmentalists said was
caught in nets that kill dolphins, caused a huge outcry here. The
ban was recently reversed by a U.S. federal District Court.
   ``What you have to ask is: what are they defending, their
nation's interest or the particular interest of these protectionist
groups?'' Salinas said.
   He said his talks with Bush would cover free trade, but not
migrant workers or democratic reforms in Mexico. He said charges of
fraud in recent elections in the states of Coahuila, Hidalgo and
Mexico will not affect the talks.
   ``We are going to negotiate exclusively aspects of trade, goods
and services. This will be the main thrust of negotiations:
Mexico's internal political affairs will be settled internally by
Mexicans,'' he said.
   Salinas said economic reforms must take precedence over
political reforms and claimed opposition parties have not been able
to present ``a consistent alternative.''
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has
ruled Mexico since its foundation in 1929. Critics have accused the
party of ensuring its hold on power by suppressing the opposition
and election fraud.
   The United States has not pushed Mexico for democratic reforms
as it has smaller countries in the region such as Nicaragua.
   The Bush administration has said it hopes to have the free trade
pact by 1992.
   ``I believe that during this meeting we will ratify our
political commitment to move ahead with negotiations and to design
a way to promote in our respective countries the positive climate
necessary to conclude these negotiations,'' Salinas said.

<TEXT>
   A Michigan Republican said Monday he will
challenge Rep. Jerry Lewis for the party's No. 3 House leadership
position, deepening the fissures that divide the chamber's minority
party.
   Rep. Carl D. Pursell, a seven-term lawmaker from Ann Arbor, said
he made the decision to seek a leadership post after receiving
support from colleagues.
   ``Many of us believe my past leadership is a good example of how
the Republican Conference should, and can, craft better policies
than the Democrats,'' Pursell said in a statement.
   The conference is the organization of all House Republicans - a
group that will total 167 in the 435-member House that convenes in
January. After suffering a net nine-seat loss in this month's
elections, the party finds itself at its lowest ebb in the House
since 1982.
   Pursell's challenge to Lewis, R-Calif., will be the second
contested leadership race when party members meet in a week to
select their leaders for the coming two years.
   Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., already has said he will seek the
job of chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
which raises money and aids GOP House candidates. That job has been
held for 14 years by Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich.
   Many see the two races as signs of a division in the party over
ideology and tactics, one which became apparent two years ago when
Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., narrowly won the party's No. 2
leadership post, Republican whip.
   The recent battle over the federal budget was one indicator of
splits within the party. Lewis supported a budget deal backed by
President Bush, while Pursell joined Gingrich in attacking the
plan.
   In the NRCC race, Gingrich is supporting Vander Jagt's bid to
retain control, while Sundquist is being encouraged by Republicans
who believe the campaign organization has stalled and needs new
leadership.

   A senior citizens group put its payroll money
into a neighborhood bank dedicated to serving the same people it
was trying to help.
   ``It was an opportunity to show a united front and maintain the
stability of the community,'' said Grace Harwood, executive
director of the Fort Greene Senior Citizens Council.
   But it and a number of other charitable organizations got a rude
awakening this month when Freedom National, once one of the
nation's largest minority-owned banks, went under.
   Groups that had more than $100,000 - the limit for federal
deposit insurance - were told they were out of luck, even if the
money was divided among several, smaller accounts.
   The United Negro College Fund had $414,000 in a certificate of
deposit, money that was being held in trust for member schools.
   ``We'll have to take funds from other sources,'' said executive
vice president Bill Allen. ``We might have to do a special
fund-raiser.''
   Bhrags Inc., which provides 700 home attendants for senior
citizens in Brooklyn, had $612,000 in Freedom when the bank was
closed Nov. 12.
   The Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council, operating 10
social-service programs that reach nearly 5,000 people, put its
losses at $700,000, said executive director Charles Joshua.
   ``We think that millions of dollars (are) at risk here,'' said
Ed Barbini, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
``It's a major setback for social services in the city.''
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. considers multiple accounts
belonging to a single depositor as a single account, said spokesman
David Barr. The only exception would be if one person or group was
holding money in trust for others, he said.
   Abrams argued that many of the community groups fit that
description, prompting the FDIC to reconsider its decision to
reimburse the groups only $100,000.
   ``We have to go back and look at that ownership trail,'' Barr
said.
   Abrams' representatives and FDIC officials met Wednesday and
plan to meet again this week.
   In the meantime, some agencies have gotten advances from city
agencies, including the Fort Greene group, which was in danger of
missing its payroll right before Thanksgiving.
   The senior citizens council, which runs five Brooklyn centers
and also provides day care services, had $316,506 in Freedom in 24
accounts, Harwood said. Since none was over the $100,000 FDIC
limit, they thought they were safe.
   ``That money is operations money; it's not money that sits
there,'' Harwood said. ``If this money is not replaced, we will
have to curtail the programs.''
   The Central Brooklyn council also got temporary funding from the
city, but Joshua stressed it would have to be paid back.
   Barr noted that Freedom's situation was not unique.
   ``When you close 600 banks over a three-year period, you're
bound to run into everything,'' he said.
   The largest bailout of an insolvent bank was the $4.5 billion
government takeover of Chicago's Continental Illinois in 1984.
   In that case, the FDIC did insure all deposits because its
failure would have had such a severe impact on the financial system
that it would have cost the government more to close it than to
save it.
   But some of Freedom's depositors see that as unfair.
   ``If that was done for Continental, why not for Freedom?'' Allen
said.
   Unless the attorney general works out a deal for the charities,
Allen said the United Negro College Fund will be standing in line
with the bank's other creditors when the FDIC auctions off its
remaining assets.
   Barr said the organizations still owed money - including the
FDIC itself - can expect to get something, depending on how much
the auction raises.
   ``Chances are they will not receive 100 cents on the dollar,''
he said.

   Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini wrote an aide in
1986 asking what ``we can do to bring heat'' on a federal banking
regulator who was opposed by savings and loan owner Charles H.
Keating Jr., the Senate Ethics Committee was told today.
   The senator's memo to his staff aide, Laurie A. Sedlmayr, was
written in December 1986, after Keating had made clear his
opposition to top bank regulator Edwin Gray, who wanted Keating's
thrift to adhere to investment limits.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett cited the memo in
questioning Sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings
into allegations DeConcini and four other senators improperly
intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating, a financial
contributor.
   Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office.
DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press accounts
of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray and asking,
``Anything we can do to bring heat?''
   She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably
unnecessary'' for him to take action and suggesting the senator
``stay out of this.'' Sedlmayr, under questioning by Bennett, said
Keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt
with.
   ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn't
comfortable with that,'' she said.
   ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the
case,'' she said.
   Keating, who owned the now defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and
his associates contributed $1.3 million to the senators' campaigns
or favored causes.
   As the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks,
DeConcini, D-Ariz., was the only one of the five senators under
investigation who attended the session. The other four are
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of
California, Donald Riegle of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio.
   Sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to DeConcini in
1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of
Keating's savings and loan. DeConcini denies he offered a deal or
tried to negotiate for Keating in the April 2, 1987, meeting.
   Sedlmayr testified that DeConcini went to the April 2 meeting
with three other senators and Gray despite being warned by an aide
that the session was a ``political mistake.''
   She testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of
the meeting, but was concerned Gray ``would misrepresent it''
later.
   ``I told him I didn't think it was a good idea and could later
be misinterpreted by the press,'' she said. ``I thought ... it was
a political mistake.''
   Sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting, but
she said that when it ended, DeConcini ``said he was pretty
disgusted.'' She said DeConcini recounted that Gray had said, ``I
don't know anything about Lincoln, I don't have any information and
you'll have to meet with the regulators in San Francisco.''
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, did not attend
that meeting. However, he did attend a session on Lincoln a week
later with the other senators and San Francisco-based federal
regulators.
   The question of whether DeConcini offered a deal on Keating's
behalf is considered crucial to the ethics investigation.
   Bennett, told the panel ``there is overwhelming evidence''
DeConcini asked Gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by Keating in
exchange for a promise by Lincoln to make more home loans.
   The regulation limited Lincoln's ability to make risky
investments in speculative real estate ventures.
   Sedlmayr's memo to her boss detailed ``What American Continental
wants from Gray for concessions,'' and ``What American Continental
is willing to do.'' American Continental was Lincoln's
Phoenix-based parent company, controlled by Keating.
   A sworn statement by another Senate aide says that DeConcini
took the Sedlmayr memo with him to the April 2 meeting and ``made
verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum.''
   That statement was by Mary Jane Veno, administrative assistant
to Glenn. She said she was told of the memo's use by Gene Karp,
DeConcini's administrative assistant. When the meeting was over,
she said, McCain asked DeConcini to explain what he had been
talking about and in response DeConcini gave McCain a copy of the
memo.
   But Karp said Friday he did not know if DeConcini actually
referred to the memo and could not recall what he told Veno.
   ``As I remember it now, Gray said at the very beginning he
didn't know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never got into the
subject matter of the investigation or anything about that,'' Karp
said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Whether there was
any specific reference made, I can't answer. Only the principals
that were there can answer it.''
   Gray has said DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo'' proposal and
that Gray believed the meeting was improper.
   No aides attended the April 2 meeting, and Bennett said there is
evidence DeConcini's office instructed all to come alone.
   Lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time
of the meeting. Bennett said the senators were there ``with varying
degrees of intensity, to pressure the board to end promptly the
Lincoln examination.''
   Lincoln was seized by the federal government in April 1989 at a
potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion to
cover insured deposits.

<HEAD>Rail Workers Strike, Demand Protection From Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of rail workers in eastern Germany
walked off the job Monday demanding protection from layoffs caused
by unification, and the strike disrupted travel in neighboring
countries.
   The strike was the first major walkout since the Germanys united
on Oct. 3. It started in Berlin Sunday evening, then spread across
eastern Germany Monday, forcing some trans-European express trains
to stop in Czechoslovakia.
   About 260,000 employees of the former East German Reichsbahn
rail authority, facing heavy layoffs in a merger with the former
West German Bundesbahn, voted overwhelmingly to strike after
negotiations broke down on Thursday.
   No new talks were scheduled.
   The East German Reichsbahn estimated that the strike caused
150,000 people to postpone trips or find other ways to travel. The
rail line carried an average of 1.6 million passengers a day in
1989.
   The planned layoffs of 68,000 workers affect not only people in
former Communist East Germany but also West Berliners, said Peter
Lind, a local strike leader advising travelers aboutbus
connections at the Berlin-Zoo Station, the main railhead in western
Berlin.
   ``We agree that there are too many workers now, but we say there
should be a longer time to reduce the number as people retire,''
Lind said.
   In another job dispute, union officials said more than 10,000
workers employed by the United States and other military services
in Germany staged one- and two-hour warning strikes Monday.
   Members of the Public Workers and Transport Union fear they may
lose 23,000 of the 100,000 civilian jobs at NATO bases because of
troop reductions resulting from the East-West accords that
permitted unification.
   The warning strikes ``have had no impact'' at Ramstein Air Base,
which is being used to send troops and supplies to the U.S.-led
multinational force arrayed against Iraq in the gulf, said Doug
Moore, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force.
   NATO base employees, like the rail workers, want retraining or
protection against layoffs.
   The rail strike hit freight as well as passenger services, but
the German news agency ADN said shipments of relief supplies to
Poland and the Soviet Union were permitted to continue.
   In Prague, the Czechoslovak news agency CTK said Germany-bound
express trains from Hungary and Romania were denied entry into
Germany and were waiting on Czechoslovak territory.
   The national rail authority would have to limit international
trains bound for Germany that already are on the Hungarian border,
CTK said.
   Pay levels in the former Communist part of Germany are about
one-third of pay scales in the west. Most industries plan to raise
eastern salaries gradually over several years to levels in the
west.
   Germany's eastern and western rail companies are to be unified
by 1992, but eastern rail workers joined the western Union of
German Rail Workers months ago.
   The union says eastern workers earn $675 to $945 a month, an
average of $675 less than their western counterparts.
   The union wants eastern salaries to reach 60 percent of western
scales in January, but its primary demand is no mass layoffs.
   Most eastern German industries, now being administered by a
national trust organization, face heavy layoffs and restructuring
to become competitive with the west.

   A blaze feeding off more than 1.6 million gallons
of jet fuel burned unchecked at Stapleton International Airport
today but appeared to diminish in intensity as two of three
ruptured tanks burned themselves out.
   Fears that a fourth tank, which had sprung a leak and was
buckling, might rupture eased by late morning.
   ``Things are going real, real good. The intensity has dropped
dramatically,'' said Fire Department spokesman Nick Nuanes, adding
that firefighters were moving closer to the tanks as the intensity
tapered off.
   Flight delays caused by a fuel shortage wrenched thousands of
travelers hurring home from their Thanksgiving visits Sunday, but
replacement fuel was being trucked in today to make up for the fuel
lost in the blaze.
   The blaze erupted Sunday morning and engulfed two tanks
containing 400,000 gallons of fuel each. It exploded from huge to
gigantic later that night when an 800,000-gallon tank became
overheated, ruptured and ignited.
   The two smaller tanks largely burned themselves out today, but
the 800,000-gallon tank continued to burn. Fire officials said the
tank contained enough fuel to burn until about midday Wednesday.
   A fourth tank containing 350,000 gallons of fuel was leaking
fuel from the bottom and the fuel was erupting into flames, but the
tank was not expected to rupture as authorities had feared earlier.
In all, the tank farm contains 12 tanks.
   Firefighters initially said Sunday that another 800,000-gallon
tank also had ignited, but it turned out that that fire was at a
holding pond where fuel had gathered behind the burning
400,000-gallon tanks. Firefighters kept fire hoses trained on that
800,000-gallon tank, hoping to keep it cooled so it would not
ignite.
   The Sunday after Thanksgiving traditionally is Stapleton's
busiest day of the year. The tanks had been filled Saturday night
in anticipation of heavy holiday air traffic, officials said.
   The fire caused flight delays, because of refueling
difficulties, and traffic jams. Stapleton is the nation's
fourth-busiest airport in terms of passenger volume.
   ``You know, I'm really hassled,'' said actress Goldie Hawn,
whose Sunday afternoon flight to Los Angeles was canceled. She and
actor Kurt Russell had been skiing in Aspen.
   The fire continued to burn fiercely and unchecked this morning.
Firefighters monitored the blaze's progress and kept fire hoses
trained on the second 800,000-gallon tank, but did not plan an
offensive to extinguish the fire.
   The blaze, which cast a haze over Denver this morning and
occasionally caused visibility problems on nearby Interstate 70,
could burn for days.
   ``This was bad and it's gotten worse, and we just have to stay
with it until it does what it's going to do,'' Denver Aviation
Director George Doughty said. ``Right now, I think it's a serious
problem, but I don't think it is endangering anything other than
the fuel farm.''
   The fire burned well north of the Stapleton terminal, where air
traffic continued. There are no homes or businesses anywhere near
the site.
   There are 12 tanks holding about 12.5 million gallons of fuel in
the storage area. The tanks are designed to rupture, not explode,
when they get overheated.
   The fire caused long flight delays Sunday for United Airlines,
which depended almost exclusively on the tank farm for its jet
fuel.
   ``This is a big problem,'' said United spokeswoman Laura
Winiarski. ``And it was a bad day to happen. This is one of our
busiest travel days of the year.''
   She said all of United's 186 flights into and out of Denver were
delayed by the fire, with some of the delays four hours or longer.
She said 24,000 passengers in Denver were affected, and thousands
of others also were delayed as flights into and out of Denver, a
major United hub, backed up.
   But today, United said its aircraft were being fueled by tanker
trucks from Conoco, predicting that the airline would return to a
normal flight schedule. Spokesman Joe Hopkins said flights arriving
at Stapleton were carrying extra fuel, further reducing the problem
of refueling.
   Firemen worked 30-minute shifts before having to take breaks
from the work near flames reaching 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``It's real debilitating,'' said firefighter Jim Hawkins. ``It's
like being in a sauna for too long. You feel like you have
spaghetti for legs.''
   Five firefighters were treated at Denver General Hospital for
dehydration and heat exhaustion and two others were treated for
smoke inhalation at the scene, but the fire caused no serious
injuries.
   Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware said jet fuel costs about
$1.40 a gallon, meaning the fuel being consumed by fire is worth
about $2.2 million.

   A Miami federal judge expressed concern today about
a growing perception that General Manuel Noriega won't be able to
get a fair trial.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who will preside over the
trial, said he would rule by Thursday on whether taping of Noriega
phone conversations may have prejudiced the case against the former
Panamanian dictator.
   He also told government attorneys he wanted proof that frozen
Noriega funds are drug-tainted, and said he would set another
hearing on the funds issue by next week.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' said Hoeveler.
   The judge said today that his ruling on the tapes issue could
extend to more than just whether the tapes violate attorney-client
privilege, but could deal with whether the tapes threaten the
broader drug case against Noriega.
   The tapes were obtained by CNN, which last week turned them over
to Hoeveler. That was after Noriega's defense attorneys moved to
block CNN from airing the tapes, saying they would prejudice the
case against their client.
   Some of the tapes are of Noriega talking to his attorney or
legal representatives.
   Hoeveler transferred the tapes to a federal magistrate in Miami,
and transcripts of them are expected to be ready this afternoon.
   Hoeveler has called a lawyers' conference for Wednesday, and
says he will issue his ruling right after the meeting or sometime
Thursday.
   On the question of Noriega's funds, Hoeveler said he planned to
a schedule a hearing within 10 days. Noriega's attorneys say they
will have to withdraw if they can't get paid because funds are
frozen.
   Hoeveler, who would have to appoint new attorneys, asked the
government to make another effort to get some Noriega funds freed
to pay for his defense. He earlier had said Noriega must have had
some legitimate income in military salary, but prosecutors have
said Panama and other foreign governments have their own forfeiture
actions tying up Noriega's money.
   Prosecutors have indicated they don't want to help the defense
by showing pretrial proof of Noriega's drug links.
   ``The government won't get to try this case by trial by
ambush,'' lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said after today's
hearing.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two strategists of last year's pro-democracy
movement have been charged with plotting to overthrow the
government, a crime punishable by death, Chinese sources said
Monday.
   The accused men are Chen Zeming, 37, who was publisher of the
now-banned Economic Studies Weekly, and Wang Juntao, 32, who was
its editor. They were also charged with counterrevolutionary
incitement.
   The charges, which come more than a year after the two were
arrested, are the most serious brought so far against any
intellectuals involved in the June 1989 protests, which were
crushed by the military.
   Their families received official notices late last week of the
charges, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. No trial
dates were set.
   In charging the two, the government moved closer to confronting
the sensitive issue of what role high-level support and
behind-the-scenes maneuvering played in the protests.
   Neither Wang nor Chen was publicly prominent during the seven
weeks of student-led marches for democratic reform that began in
Beijing and spread nationwide.
   But after the movement was crushed, the official media accused
Chen and Wang of being ``black hands'' who manipulated the students
in an effort to topple the government.
   Hong Kong news reports said the two men, both participants in
earlier democracy movements, met frequently with student leaders
and helped plan strategy, including the timing of marches and
wording of demands.
   Wang had ties to high Communist Party officials dating from the
early 1980s, when he was an alternate member of the Communist Youth
League's Central Committee.
   Official Chinese news reports last year accused Bao Tong,
secretary to then-Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, of
involvement in plotting the protests. By formally charging Wang and
Chen, the government has committed itself to reveal more details of
what happened behind the scenes, potentially implicating Zhao's
aide.
   Zhao himself was ousted for allegedly supporting the movement,
but the party has closed its investigation of him without
announcing any conclusion because of the danger of splitting party
ranks.
   After announcing thousands of arrests immediately after crushing
the protests, authorities stopped releasing information. Word of
charges being filed and sentences being handed down has come only
from relatives and friends of those accused.
   The Beijing city Foreign Affairs Office said it had not heard
about Wang and Chen being charged. Their trials are likely to be
closed.
   At least 18 workers and peasants have been executed on charges
of murder, theft and destroying state property during riots that
followed the army crackdown on the protesters.
   Unofficial reports have emerged of other protesters receiving
prison sentences of up to 15 years. Hundreds of lesser participants
have been sent to camps for three-year terms of ``education through
labor,'' a sentence that can be handed down by police without
trial.
   The government also has acknowledged that 355 prisoners are
still awaiting charges in Beijing alone.
   Neither family has been allowed to visit Wang or Chen since they
were arrested in Canton in October 1989, apparently while trying to
flee the country. They are believed held in Beijing's Qincheng
Prison, where other political offenders are jailed.
   Both men were active in earlier movements for democratic reform.
Wang helped found and edit an unofficial journal called ``Beijing
Spring'' during a brief period of oen political debate in 1978-79
known as the Democracy Wall Movement.
   He and Chen were arrested in 1976 for taking part in mass
protests in Tiananmen Square against the radical leftist leaders of
the Cultural Revolution.
   They were released and praised as heroes when the Cultural
Revolution leadership was ousted and the protest was officially
reappraised as having been patriotic.

   Commuter traffic backed up for miles on icy roads
today after a weekend deluge sank a floating bridge across Lake
Washington, which separates Seattle's eastern suburbs from
downtown.
   Still, it could have been worse, the Washington State Patrol
said. Most commuters were aware the Interstate 90 bridge was closed
and got an early start, patrol communications supervisor Vickie
Crawford said.
   ``It's really not as bad as we thought it would be,'' she said.
But, she added, ``It was pretty much gridlocked earlier this
morning.''
   About 2,100 feet of the 2-mile-long Mercer Island floating
bridge sank into the lake Sunday after a weekend of high winds and
record rains. The bridge, adjacent to the year-old I-90 floating
bridge, was being renovated for eventual use as I-90's eastbound
lanes.
   Officials said the new bridge would probably be closed for
weeks. As the main link between Seattle and its suburbs east of the
lake, the bridge normally handles 110,000 cars a day.
   Freezing temperatures overnight caused icy roads, which resulted
in numerous fender-benders, Crawford said. No serious injuries were
reported.
   Metro, the regional transit agency, added extra buses to try to
ease the commute.
   Floodwaters started to back down today after the weekend storm
left thousands of people scrambling for higher ground.
   Twenty rivers overflowed their banks and highwater marks for
five of them set records. Rainfall set records too, with 5.82
inches in Olympia and 3.56 inches at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport during the 24 hours ending Saturday afternoon.
   Sixteen highways and dozens of local roads remained closed early
today. Gov. Booth Gardner issued an emergency declaration for 12
counties, bringing to 17 the number for which federal aid has been
sought.
   The state is still reeling from flooding in five counties two
weeks ago that caused an estimated $40 million in damage.
   ``My state is falling apart on me,'' Gardner said Sunday.
   More rain was forecast for today, but colder weather was
expected to ease the flooding by holding precipitation as snow in
the upper watersheds, National Weather Service specialist Patrick
Brandow said.
   At least 3,000 people across the state fled their homes over the
weekend because of the flooding. Thirteen Red Cross shelters
remained open Sunday night.
   Gen. Gregory Barlow, head of Washington National Guard, said an
area about 40 miles northeast of Seattle appeared to be hardest
hit, with water covering the roofs of houses.
   One man was missing and presumed drowned after he drove past a
barricade and into the floodwaters of the Snoqualmie River early
Sunday, police said. His wife and infant daughter were rescued.
   A 125-foot barge broke free from its mooring and slammed into a
bridge before sinking, but no major damage resulted and no one was
injured.
   State transportation engineers and police closed the new
seven-lane I-90 bridge between Seattle and Mercer Island, after the
old floating bridge that parallels it collapsed. They feared loose
pieces of the old bridge could damage it.
   The bridge floated on the water like a ship anchored nn place,
and has flotation chambers that can be pumped out. Dedicated in
1940, it was the world's first concrete pontoon floating bridge,
said William Southern Jr., a spokesman for the Washington
Department of Transportation.
   He said the new bridge would be closed at least through Tuesday
and possibly as long as three weeks.
   Brian Henkel, the former manager of the bridge project, told
KIRO-TV in Seattle that the bridge may have collapsed because of an
oversight by construction crews.
   Henkel inspected what was left of the bridge Sunday. He said
sections of the bridge deck and hatches in the concrete pontoons
were left open.
   That allowed to rising lake water to pour through the side
hatches and started ``a domino effect which finished up with losing
portions of the bridge,'' Henkel said.
   Other officials said high winds and heavy rain contributed to
the collapse, although the exact cause was under investigation.
   Emergency volunteers in Stanwood, about 40 miles north of
Seattle, were treated to Swedish meatballs, salads, cheese and
wedding cake after a wedding party was cut off from its reception
hall.
   In Whatcom County, Mike Walsh of Marietta vowed to sell his home
after being swamped twice in two weeks. ``That's it. I'm out of
here.''

<TEXT>
   In the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. announced today that it is
buying MCA Corp., owner of Universal Studios, in a deal worth $6.6
billion.
   Matsushita, a $37.8 billion giant known for such brand names as
Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, is Japan's biggest manufacturer of
consumer electronics equipment.
   By buying the maker of such box office hits as ``Jaws'' and
``Back to the Future,'' Matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace
with archrival Sony Corp., which bought Columbia Pictures for $5
billion a year ago, analysts said.
   Universal is the fourth Hollywood studio to come under foreign
control. The deal seems likely to heighten fears in the United
States that too many major U.S. companies are falling under
Japanese control.
   Asked how the purchase would affect U.S.-Japan relations,
Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, said jokingly that he hoped
``MCA will make a movie called `Japan-Bashing.'''
   Under the agreement, Matsushita is to start a cash tender offer
of $66 a share for MCA's about 92.8 million shares of common stock
by Nov. 30.
   MCA shareholders will also get stock in a television station
that cannot be sold to Matsushita because federal rules prohibit
foreign-based companies from owning U.S. broadcast stations.
   The deal calls for MCA shareholders to get one share in a new
company that will own MCA's New York-area television station, WWOR,
for every five shares of MCA stock they own just before the tender
offer is completed.
   Company officials have estimated the new shares will be worth
about $5 for every share of MCA stock. Adding that to the $66 per
share in cash brings the per-share value to $71, or nearly $6.6
billion, for MCA's fully diluted shares.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MCA was the most
actively traded issue, slipping 25 cents a share by late morning to
$65.12{.
   MCA Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, 77-year-old
Lew Wasserman, stands to earn about about $355 million from the
deal. Wasserman had personal holdings of 5 million MCA shares, or 7
percent, and controlled an additional 6 million through trusts and
charities.
   ``Matsushita is a great international company,'' Wasserman said.
``This combination assures the structural integrity of MCA and its
worldwide operation. MCA will continue to operate under its own
name and will be run by its existing management.''
   The purchase, which followed two months of intense, sometimes
frustrating negotiations, is seen as Matsushita's attempt to
dominate the growing merger of technological hardware and
entertainment industries.
   ``Software and hardware have been developing simultaneously -
they are like wheels of the same car,'' Tanii said at company
headquarters in Osaka. ``We intend that excellent works made by MCA
will be distributed all over the world through a variety of
media.''
   Analysts say Matsushita will now have a ready stock of
high-profile movie and television programming to use for its high
definition television, considered the next generation in home
entertainment.
   Nonetheless, several analysts said the much-touted ``natural''
linkup between hardware manufacturers and movie, video and TV
entertainment companies is still an unproven strategy. For one
thing, digitalizing older movies and TV programs for high
definition TV is very expensive.
   ``It looks like they're doing it and trying to figure out
strategy afterward,'' said Mike Jeremy, an analyst in Tokyo for
Baring Securities.
   In Japan, Matsushita is jokingly called ``Maneshita,'' or
``copycat,'' for its custom of introducing products only after its
competitors have tested the market for them.
   But some people envision a future of integrated home
entertainment consoles that would include high definition TV, a
personal computer, stereo and other gadgetry. And that future may
accrue to the company with the most prominent image, analysts said.
   ``Sony has a strong image. People in most countries would
automatically know what a Walkman is,'' Jeremy said. ``Matsushita
has Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, but they need to rationalize
themselves into one image.''
   But in an atmosphere of trade friction between the United States
and Japan - not to mention the potential of a further downturn in
the U.S. economy - Matsushita is taking a big risk, analysts say.
   ``The biggest problem is the negative image of Japanese buying
up everything in the U.S.,'' said Rodney Harada, an analyst for
Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``One of the biggest reasons I was
surprised by the deal was because Matsushita has always been
careful to improve its image before.''
   Apart from Universal Pictures, which also produced such hits as
``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' MCA's holdings include a robust
television division featuring winners like ``Murder, She Wrote''
and ``Quantum Leap.''
   MCA Records carries the popular teen vocalist Tiffany, as well
as the sultry star Sheena Easton.
   MCA, which earned $191 million last year on revenues of $3.4
billion, also owns a book publishing division, theme parks and real
estate.
   In addition to Universal and Columbia Pictures, the other two
Hollywood studios to come under foreign control are 20th Century
Fox, now under Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. based in Australia, and
MGM-UA Communications Inc., now owned by Italian-controlled Pathe
Communications Corp.

<HEAD>Poet's $2,200 Trust for Elderly Home Grows to $215,000 After 72
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $2,200 gift by a farsighted poet 72 years
ago has swelled nearly one hundredfold and will be used to
establish a home for the elderly retarded.
   Henry C. Burns, who died in 1918 a childless widower, left
$2,207.21 in trust along with a collection of his poetry and prose.
He directed that the trust be used to fund housing for the elderly
retarded once it reached $175,000.
   The account, held at Pittsburgh National Bank, passed that
amount about a year ago, bank officials said, and now stands at
almost $215,000.
   In accordance with the terms of the trust, bank officials began
soliciting proposals for the home when the account surpassed the
$175,000 point, said John D. Culbertson, a bank vice president.
   The bank, named Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co. at the time of Burns'
death, was instructed in the will to give the money to city, county
or state authorities, ``whichever shall give the best assurance''
of establishing such a home.
   City and state officials deferred to Allegheny County, which
already contracts with agencies for services for older citizens.
The county began site searching this month.
   A gift from a trust ``happens occasionally, but not in this
order of magnitude,'' said Raymond Firth, deputy director of the
county's mental health program.
   County officials said they may seek funds from private
foundations to add to the trust, and may establish more than one
group home, Firth said.
   Advancements in medicine have increased the life span of
retarded people and the need for housing, Firth said.
   Burns' will instructed that the home be named ``Our Father's
Relief Accumulated Fund Home for Aged and Infirm People.'' He also
stipulated that bound copies of ``Musings of a Blind Man,'' a
collection of his poems and prose writings, were to be kept at the
home ``for general use and reading.''
   But residents of the home will not be able to read Burns' books.
Officials of Pittsburgh Nationl Bank don't know what happened to
the volumes, which were last referred to in records in March 1924.
   Culbertson speculated that the books may have been stored in the
bank's downtown vault, which was swamped in a 1936 flood.

   Move over, Jose Canseco. Shove aside,
Barry Bonds. Make room for Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee.
   The booming trading card market, already crowded with baseball,
hockey, football, basketball, bowling and golf cards, has a new
contender: astronaut cards.
   They are the idea of Ed White III, whose father was one of three
astronauts who died in the launch-pad fire of the Apollo I
spacecraft in 1967. The others were Grissom and Chaffee.
   White has paid tribute to the three Apollo astronauts in series
No. 1 of SpaceShots, which he bills as The Trading Cards of The
Future. He says the cards are drawing the attention of card
collectors and space buffs.
   ``We're advertising in several space-oriented publications with
a mail-in form and a toll-free telephone number,'' said White, who
lives in Houston. He was on Mississippi's Gulf Coast to visit
relatives.
   White said he was a baseball card and coin collector in the
1960s, and when he read a newspaper column about three years ago
describing the value of old cards, he pulled his collection out of
the attic.
   ``I was surprised,'' White said. ``The baseball card collection
was worth five times the coin collection.''
   That is when the idea came to him.
   He was in the telecommunications business at the time, and the
space card project was a hobby. He sold his business earlier this
year so that he and a friend, Jim Roettger, could devote their full
attention to the cards.
   SpaceShots are produced by their Dallas-based company, Space
Ventures Inc.
   White said he and Roettger hope to put out four sets a year,
with each set containing 110 cards. ``Eventually, we will also
package them in smaller sets like baseball cards,'' he said.
   White said 25 percent of the proceeds will be donated to the
Astronaut Memorial, which is under construction at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida. The monument will honor those astronauts
who lost their lives aboard Apollo I, the space shuttle Challenger
and four who died in training before 1967.

   Bands of Jewish zealots are burning shops and
threatening Jerusalem merchants to force the firing of Arab
workers, and the intimidation campaign is drawing angry comparisons
with racist treatment of Jews.
   On Monday, police arrested four followers of slain extremist
Rabbi Meir Kahane on suspicion of involvement in the incitement.
Politicians ranging from the left to the right joined in protesting
the violence.
   ``For anyone familiar with Jewish history, it brings to mind
difficult pictures from our past,'' Justice Minister Dan Meridor of
the right-wing Likud bloc said on Israel radio. ``Such things must
be uprooted. ... We should not tolerate expressions of racism.''
   He pointed particularly to efforts to force shopkeepers to
display signs saying ``I don't employ Arabs'' - chillingly similar
to signs disavowing employment of Jews that appeared in German
shops before the Holocaust. Six million Jews were killed by the
Nazis.
   ``I can remind you where and when it appeared on storefronts,
`Jews Don't Work Here,''' said lawmaker Yossi Sarid of the liberal
Citizens' Rights Movement.
   Jerusalem Police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said four suspects,
all followers of Kahane's Kach movement, were arrested on charges
of threatening shopowners, incitement and causing damage.
   He identified three as Kach spokesman Noam Federman, and
activists Tiran Pollack and Baruch Marzel. The fourth was not
identified.
   Israel radio said police were conducting an intensive
investigation of the threats and violence.
   The anti-Arab campaign plays on Jewish fears following a series
of revenge attacks on Israelis for the deaths of 17 Palestinians in
police gunfire during stone-throwing riots on Jerusalem's Temple
Mount in October.
   The attacks spurred calls to replace the thousands of
Palestinians from the occupied territories and annexed east
Jerusalem who work in Israel, often as trash collectors, restaurant
workers and at other low-paying jobs.
   Federman told Israel radio prior to his arrest that the party
was not using violence. But he admitted Kach was trying to persuade
shop owners to fire Arabs.
   ``We have approached shopkeepers, including one whose shop was
burned, and asked them to fire (the Arabs). He did not fire them so
it's reasonable to believe that angry citizens did it, and I
understand them,'' Federman said.
   The campaign against employing Arabs began shortly after the
shooting death of Kahane in New York on Oct. 5. The suspected
gunman is an Arab-American.
   Groups of young Jewish men have paid visits to shopkeepers in
the predominantly Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhoods of Beit Israel
and Geulah, urging them to dismiss Arab workers. Slogans were
spray-painted on the walls of stores, saying: ``A warning to the
employer of the Arabs.''
   In Beit Israel, walls were plastered with posters that said:
``Employing Arabs in our midst is dangerous to life. We are not
ready to live in danger and permanent fear just because the
merchants who employ Arabs want to make some extra money.''
   The posters were signed by ``residents and rabbis of the
neighborhood.''
   Although dozens of Arabs still work in Beit Israel, only a few
of the original 40 remained at the nearby Bukharian Market,
newspaper reports said Monday.
   About two weeks ago, a butcher shop was set ablaze in Beit
Israel. A grocery store was burned in the neighborhood Sunday
night, and the writing on its wall said: ``Death to the Arabs.''
   ``This month, they started to threaten with slogans painted on
the walls outside. ... We fired the Arabs and still they came and
burned the shop,'' said the grocery's owner, Aryeh Moshe.
   Another shopkeeper, Mordechai Mizrahi, was stabbed in the arm
earlier this month by a Kach supporter while trying to defend his
Arab employee. The Arab, Amad Abu Sina, suffered serious wounds.
   Now, Mizrahi's butcher store features a sign: ``No Arabs
employed here.''
   ``We defended the Arab as we would defend anybody who is
attacked in the store,'' Mizrahi told the daily Maariv. ``But when
we speak of income, it's another matter. We have no choice, if we
employ Arabs we starve. People are not ready to buy the goods when
they see than an Arab had touched them.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev forcefully warned
Saddam Hussein Monday that the unity of those nations allied
against Iraqi aggression cannot be broken.
   Another Soviet official, meanwhile, accused Baghdad of breaking
a promise to allow the departure of 1,000 Soviets still in Iraq and
threatened a ``tougher attitude'' by Moscow if they were not
permitted to leave.
   As the United States sought United Nations approval this week of
a resolution authorizing the use of military force if Iraq does not
withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1, the Soviet Union embarked on a new
round of meetings with officials from Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
   Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met
with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in the Kremlin Monday to
reiterate the Soviet demand that Iraq withdraw troops from Kuwait.
Shevardnadze will meet with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal
on Tuesday.
   Gorbachev told Aziz to ask Saddam to rethink the Iraqi position
because Baghdad's destiny is in the hands of its leadership and
time is slipping away, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The Soviet leader told Aziz that if Iraq wants to avoid the
worst, it must leave Kuwait, free Western hostages and permit all
foreigners to leave, Tass said. Saddam's arguments that Kuwait is
Iraqi land and that Iraq was threatened by its neighbor are not
taken seriously, the news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   Aziz replied he would take Gorbachev's message to Saddam, and he
indicated that a ``bureaucratic accident'' had resulted in the
delay of the departure of the Soviet specialists, Tass reported.
   Answering questions from legislators in the Supreme Soviet
parliament about the possibility of a conflict in the Persian Gulf
involving the United States, Gorbachev said the crisis was a test
of the new post-Cold War cooperation.
   ``Our position remains based on principles and it includes the
following: Aggression is inadmissible. It should be punished, and
the pre-aggression state should be restored,'' Gorbachev said, his
voice booming.
   ``We are in favor of preserving a unity of action in the
framework of the United Nations ... and the Security Council.
That's important,'' he said.
   ``And we are reaffirming that we are going to cooperate with
everybody - the United States, the permanent members of the
Security Council, all the members of the Security Council and the
United Nations organization, Arabs, Europeans, etc. - so as to
leave no pretext and no hope for the Saddam Hussein regime that it
can break this unity,'' Gorbachev said, pounding the lectern.
   He said Saddam's aggression could not be allowed to prevail
``because we are just moving away from the Cold War, when
everything was decided from a position of force.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would discuss with other U.N.
Security Council members whether a new resolution needed to be
adopted.
   The Soviet Union has given its qualified consent to the use of
force in the gGulf, but is pushing for a diplomatic settlement. It
has urged the Bush administration to be patient for another two
months.
   Also Monday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin
said Iraq had agreed to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract
workers, to leave during November, but only about 350 people were
permitted to do so.
   There were about 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred
military advisers, in Iraq when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. About
3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to leave
shortly after the invasion and about 1,000 left during September
and October.
   Churkin said Iraq had agreed to allow another 1,000 to leave in
November, but was not living up to its promise. ``Iraq is not
keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from
leaving,'' he said. ``This is totally abnormal and unacceptable.''
   He said, ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and
allow our citizens to leave, this will complicate the present
situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to kill
two fair-housing lawsuits stemming from newspaper real estate
advertisements showing only white models posing as homeowners.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that forces
developers of a Virginia condominium community to defend themselves
in a jury trial against allegations they violated federal law.
   The suits center on ads that appeared in The Washington Post
over a 17-month period beginning in 1985 for Colonial Village, a
condo community in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from
the District of Columbia.
   The suits were filed by Girardeau Spann, a black resident of
Washington who is a professor at Georgetown University's law
school, and two advocacy groups - the Metropolitan Washington
Planning and Housing Association and the Fair Housing Council of
Greater Washington.
   Named as defendants are Colonial Village Inc., and its parent
firm, Mobil Land Development Corp., a subsidiary of the oil
company.
   The lawsuits allege that the defendants violated the Fair
Housing Act by featuring only white models in ads that appeared in
the Post. The suits said the ads were racially preferential and
discriminatory, and they sought an injunction and monetary damages.
   A federal trial judge in 1987 threw out the suits, ruling they
had been filed too late.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reinstated them last
March 13, and sent the dispute back to U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene for trial.

<HEAD>Court Revives Suit Over Use of Monkeys in Research</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Scotus Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court revived a longstanding legal
battle Monday in which animal rights groups are trying to save four
monkeys used for medical research.
   The justices said they will decide whether a federal agency
should have been allowed to transfer the groups' lawsuit against it
from state to federal court, where the suit was killed.
   If the animal rights groups win in the high court, their fight
will be sent back to a Maryland state court. If the justices had
rejected the groups' appeal, their legal fight would have ended.
   The controversy dates back to 1981. Alex Pacheco, then a George
Washington University student, said the research business for which
he worked as a volunteer did not provide sufficient food and water,
sanitation or veterinary care for 17 macaque monkeys.
   Only four of the original group of 17 are the subjects of the
legal fight. Five have been moved to the San Diego Zoo and eight
have died or been killed.
   In a federally funded project at its Silver Spring, Md.,
laboratory, the Institute for Behavioral Research was studying the
ability of monkeys to use limbs after nerves were severed.
   Maryland police seized the monkeys in late 1981, and the
National Institutes of Health, a federal agency, assumed custody of
the animals. They eventually ended up at Tulane University's Delta
Regional Primate Research Center in Covington, La.
   NIH was sued in 1988 by Pacheco and the group he founded, People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and two other animal rights
groups - International Primate Protection League and Louisiana In
Support of Animals.
   The groups filed their lawsuit in a state court, but the NIH had
the case transferred to a federal court. Eventually, the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the lawsuit dismissed.
   The issue to be decided by the Supreme Court is whether the
federal agency should have been allowed to remove the lawsuit from
the state court.

<TEXT>
   Two state lawmakers filed a bill Monday to prevent
singing groups like the pop duo Milli Vanilli from giving the
audience nothing but lip service in Massachusetts.
   ``If you pay `real' money for a concert, you ought to get `real'
live music in return,'' said Rep. Kevin Poirier.
   The bill would require promoters to disclose whetherany part of
a performance consists of pre-recorded vocals. Ticket agents would
also be required to notify concertgoers of plans for the headline
performer to use pre-recorded vocals. Under the bill, ticket agents
could be fined up to $5,000 and promoters up to $50,000 for
violations.
   Similar legislation has been proposed in New York and New
Jersey. Both were introduced before the revelation two weeks ago
that the Milli Vanilli duo of Fabrice Morvan and Rob Pilatus did
not sing in concerts or on their album. No action was taken on the
legislation in either state.
   New York's bill would have gone further than the proposed
legislation in Massachusetts and New Jersey, requiring disclosures
in advertisements.
   ``It's time to stop the phoney road shows,'' said Rep. William
Vernon, co-sponsor of the Massachusetts legislation.
   Carl Freed, executive director of the North American Concert
Promoters Association, said lip-syncing has become more prevalent
in live acts because performers are expected to do complicated
dance routines.
   In a recent concert tour, Madonna performed a duet with a dancer
who lip-synced a song that Warren Beatty sang on her album.
   Instead of forcing promoters and ticket sellers to disclose
lip-syncing, Freed said the artists should tell their fans what
they do in performance. The music industry may not be inclined to
take action unless ticket sales drop off at concerts where the
singing is staged, he said.

a New York parental rights law that barred many men from vetoing
the adoptions of their illegitimate children.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling by New
York's highest court that the law violated fathers' constitutional
rights.
   Until a 1979 ruling by the nation's highest court, fathers of
children born out of wedlock had no parental rights.
   But in a series of decisions since, the court has said an unwed
father may challenge a mother's putting the child up for adoption
if he has ``manifested a significant paternal interest in the
child.''
   Under the invalidated New York law, a ``significant paternal
interest'' had to be proved in three ways:
   -The father had to have lived with the mother or the child
during the six months before the child was placed for adoption.
   -He had to openly acknowledge his fatherhood.
   -He had to have paid for pregnancy and birth expenses.
   In striking down the law last July, the New York Court of
Appeals said, ``The ... requirement that the father openly live
with the mother before a child's placement for adoption neither
legitimately furthers the state's interest nor sufficiently protect
that father's, and (the law) must therefore be declared
unconstitutional.''
   The July ruling cast doubt on the proposed adoption by a Nashua,
N.H., couple of a girl born out of wedlock in White Plains, N.Y.,
two years ago.
   Lower courts had ruled that the adoption could be finalized
without the consent of the child's biological father.

   ``Cheers'' star Kirstie Alley said her
whole life changed when she broke free of drug addiction.
   ``It changed my relationship with my family,'' she said. ``I
started telling the truth, which was a big difference for me. I
started having real relationships. I married a really hot-looking
guy. I started a career rather late in life from what most actors
and actresses start their careers.''
   Alley, who spent the Thanksgiving weekend with relatives in
Wichita, said she has been drug free since entering the Narconon
program in Los Angeles in 1979. On Sunday, she and her husband,
actor Parker Stevenson, visited Narconon Chilocco, the group's new
drug rehabilitation center outside Newkirk, Okla.
   Alley portrays self-conscious ``Cheers'' manager Rebecca Howe on
the television show and stars in the current film comedy ``Sibling
Rivalry.'' She said she turned to cocaine when her life took a
series of wrong turns while she was working in Wichita as an
interior designer in the late 1970s.
   ``I wasn't an actress, like I wanted to be,'' she said. ``It was
sort of hard in Kansas to say, you know, `I want to be a movie
star.' You don't get a lot of validation for that.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The former wife of jazz saxophonist Stan Getz
lost a Supreme Court appeal alleging New York's divorce law
violates the rights of women.
   The justices, without comment, on Monday rejected arguments by
Monica Getz that the state law favors men by permitting them to
wage ``legal wars of attrition'' against their wives, who often
lack equal financial resources.
   Getz, 63, sued for divorce in 1981, after Mrs. Getz, 56, went to
court alleging her husband - suffering from alcoholism and drug
addiction - abused her. She sought a court order for family support
payments and protection against Getz.
   The couple later made attempts at reconciliation before the
divorce became final in 1987. A state jury ruled in Getz's favor in
granting the divorce. He had accused his wife of infidelity and
trying to poison him. A state judge ruled that Mrs. Getz is
entitled to half her husband's royalties from the beginning of
their marriage in 1956 to 1981.
   In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Getz said the case
should have been resolved in New York's family courts, which are
designed to expedite divorce cases to save legal fees, rather than
by trial courts that handle corporate disputes and other matters.
   Mrs. Getz said she has spent more than $600,000 in legal fees
and will be forced to use the proceeds from the couple's mansion in
Irvington, N.Y., where she still lives, to pay off the bills.

   Bo Schembechler doesn't coach here
anymore, but his $12 million legacy at the University of Michigan
is being criticized as sexist.
   Schembechler Hall, named after the football coach who resigned
in January, opened this fall as the home of Michigan's football
program. But the Center of Champions is off limits to Michigan
athletes who don't play football.
   ``This is the 1990s. People (of both sexes) can work in the same
space. This would have been the perfect time for equality,'' said
Tricia Maran, a Michigan field hockey player.
   The criticism probably won't make any difference, officials
said.
   ``It's pretty hard for me or anybody else on the Board of
Regents to say Bo can't build a building for football, especially
if he raises the dough for it,'' trustee Philip Power said Sunday.
``You have to be realistic.''
   Schembechler, who ended his 26-year career at Michigan with a
234-65-8 record, is president of the Detroit Tigers baseball team.

said Monday.
   The informal visit had been scheduled for the summer, but was

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Science fiction writer Ray Bradbury says the
heart should always rule the head, even if it means jumping off a
few cliffs.
   The 60-year-old author of such books as ``Fahrenheit 451'' and
``The Martian Chronicles'' said he succeeded because he learned to
ignore naysayers.
   ``If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love
affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business
because we'd be cynical,'' Bradbury said in a recent interview.
   ``Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the
time and build your wings on the way down.''
   Bradbury, who shunned college in favor of independent reading,
has published more than 500 short stories plus several successful
novels and screenplays, including a 1954 adaptation of ``Moby
Dick.''
   Two of Bradbury's books have been published this year. ``A
Graveyard of Lunatics,'' is a murder mystery based on his
experiences as a screenwriter. ``Zen and the Art of Writing,'' is a
nonfiction work.

<HEAD>Plan Calls For Tolls, Other Fees to Visit Florida Keys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visitors would have to pay to play in the
Florida Keys under a state proposal to raise money to protect
what's left of the fragile marine environment there.
   The biological slide of the Keys has pushed the stat Department
of Natural Resources to create the state's first marine reserve,
funded by a 50-cent road toll on the Overseas Highway, a $1 flight
fee at county airports and a $5 snorkeling charge.
   ``Like it or not, Keys waters - that are not owned by the people
in the Keys but by the state as a whole - are the most important
national and international resource that we have,'' said Edwin
Conklin, the agency's director of marine planning.
   But independence-minded Keys residents - who once staged a mock
secession from the union and declared themselves citizens of the
Conch Republic when they became fed up with federal policies -
aren't exactly buying into the proposal, which goes before Gov. Bob
Martinez and the Cabinet on Tuesday.
   ``I just don't think we need this level of bureaucracy,'' Monroe
County Commissioner Doug Jones said.
   If the fees are adopted, the state expects to collect $10
million a year to fund enforcement, research and education projects
in the reserve, which would cover state waters roughly three miles
into the Atlantic and 10 miles into the Gulf of Mexico.
   The 50-cent toll would require congressional approval because
U.S. Highway 1, which stretches south to Key West, is a federal
road.
   The airport fee would be paid by anyone flying into the Keys'
commercial airports in Key West and Marathon, and the snorkeling
fee would be in the form of a $5 annual stamp similar to existing
fishing license fees.
   ``Divers are a big user of the Keys,'' Conklin said. ``It is
unfortunate that we have to ask for money but a few bucks, which is
what we're asking for, is not going to kill the industry.''
   Access would be limited or barred in some threatened portions of
one of the world's prime coral reef tracts, which drew 1 million
visitors last year.
   An operating license would be required for Keys boaters even
though legislation for a statewide boating license failed this
year.

<HEAD>Rapid X-Ray Test Developed for Detecting Coronary Artery Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer-enhanced X-rays are showing promise in
rapidly detecting coronary artery disease in people under 60
without requiring the insertion of tubes or other equipment into
the body, radiologists said Monday.
   A technique called ultrafast computed tomography that uses such
X-rays to detect calcium in arteries could be highly accurate and
cost-effective in detecting coronary artery disease, the doctors
reported.
   ``Ultrafast CT appeared to be able to rule out significant
coronary artery disease in 100 percent of the cases we studied,''
said Dr. Jerome Breen of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   He presented his findings at the 76th annual meeting of the
Radiological Society of North America, which began its five-day run
Monday in Chicago.
   Ultrafast CT was performed on 100 patients ages 23 to 59 who
were sent to specialists for coronary angiograms, primarily because
of symptoms such as chest pain or chest tightness that suggested
coronary artery disease, Breen said.
   An angiogram requires that an artery, usually in the groin, be
punctured and a tube threaded up into the chest arteries that feed
the heart. An X-ray dye is then injected into the heart arteries
and X-rays are taken of them.
   The accuracy of the ultrafast CT was determined by comparing its
results to the results of angiograms taken on each of the patients,
Breen reported.
   ``In every case in our study, if no calcium was detected on CT,
there was no significant coronary disease seen on the angiogram,''
Breen said. Significant disease was defined as at least one
coronary artery blocked by 50 percent or more.
   ``Ultrafast CT is exquisitely sensitive at detecting the
presence of calcium in the arteries, a sign of atherosclerotic
disease,'' Breen said.
   Atherosclerosis is a buildup of patchy deposits that can clog
arteries and may eventually lead to heart attacks.
   ``Detecting calcium on ultrafast CT does not necessarily mean
serious disease, but the more severe the calcification, the more
likely it is that significant disease is present,'' he said.
   Dr. Daniel Mark, a cardiologist at Duke University Medical
Center, said the test sounds promising but will require further
study.
   ``It does not seem to me they've come out with something
totally, radically new,'' he said, noting that calcium deposits in
arteries have long been linked with heart disease.
   Also, many, if not most, heart patients are over 60, when
calcium begins to appear in the arteries as a normal sign of aging,
limiting the test's usefulness, he said in a telephone interview
Monday from Durham, N.C.
   Because calcium is increasingly present as elderly people age,
the researchers limited their study to people under 60, Breen said.
   He said ultrafast CT is non-invasive, painless and virtually
risk-free. The procedure is expected to compete in cost with
conventional heart-stress tests and to be performed in a few
minutes, he said.
   However, he emphasized that his results were preliminary, and he
said researchers should study more patients before the test's
usefulness is established.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide on Mandatory Retirement Age for State Judges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs lede to clarify that state judges are asking for same
rights as other state employees, not federal judges.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether states may force judges to retire at age 70 if those states
impose no such requirement on virtually all other employees in desk
jobs.
   The high court voted to study arguments by two Missouri judges
that their state's mandatory retirement age violates federal law
and unconstitutionally treats them differently from other state
employees.
   The justices, four of whom are over 70, are expected to announce
their decision by July. The court's nine members, like all federal
trial and appellate judges, are appointed for life.
   In another case, the court left intact a ban on poor and
homeless people begging for money in New York City's subways.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the ban on ``begging and panhandling'' throughout the subway system
violates free-speech rights.
   A federal judge had ruled that the ban was unconstitutional but
a federal appeals court reinstated the ban by a 2-1 vote last May.
   In other matters Monday, the high court:
   -Refused to kill two fair-housing lawsuits that stem from
newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models
posing as homeowners. Now, developers of a Virginia condominium
community must defend themselves in a jury trial against
allegations they violated a federal anti-bias law.
   -Revived a long legal battle from Maryland in which animal
rights groups are seeking to save four monkeys used for medical
research. The court said it will decide whether a lawsuit against a
federal agency, already thrown out of federal court, should return
to a state court.
   -Rejected the appeal of Richard B. Kelly, the former Florida
congressman who served 13 months in prison for his 1981 bribery
conviction in the FBI's Abscam undercover sting operation.
   -Agreed to decide in a Michigan case how far states can go to
shield victims of sexual assaults from unfair treatment without
violating defendants' fair-trial rights.
   -Agreed to decide in a Wisconsin case whether divorced people
awarded ownership of the family home may use federal bankruptcy law
to avoid a divorce court's order to pay their ex-spouses one-half
of the home's value.
   -Refused to kill an affirmative action program in Hillsborough
County, Fla., aimed at awarding more public works contracts to
business run by minorities and women. A lawsuit filed by white men
who say they are victims of reverse discrimination is pending
before a federal judge.
   -Refused to revive a New York parental rights law that barred
many men from challenging the adoptions of their illegitimate
children.
   The court's eventual decision in the Missouri dispute over a
mandatory retirement age for judges likely will affect many states
with similar laws.
   If the justices reach the constitutional issue - whether such a
law violates equal-protection guarantees - both appointed and
elected state judges will be affected. If limited to a federal law
banning age bias, the ruling would affect only appointed state
judges because the federal law does not apply to elected officials.
   The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
March that Missouri's judges fall into the anti-bias law's
exception for ``appointees on the policymaking level.''
   The appeals court also ruled that the state's mandatory
retirement age is constitutional because it is a rational way to
insure a vigorous and healthy judiciary and to increase
opportunities for younger people to serve as judges.
   The 8th Circuit court's ruling appears to conflict with a
decision announced two months later by the New York-based 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed a 71-year-old state judge
from Vermont to remain on the bench.
   The 2nd Circuit court ruled that appointed state judges are not
``appointees on the policymaking level'' and therefore are
protected by the federal anti-bias law.
   Lawyers for Missouri judges Ellis Gregory Jr. and Anthony Nugent
Jr. urged the justices to resolve the conflicting rulings.
   The Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue, but in 1988 left
intact New York's policy of forcing elected judges to retire at age
70 even though no such mandatory retirement is imposed on appointed
judges in the state.
   The court's four oldest justices are Thurgood Marshall, 82;
Harry A. Blackmun, 82; Byron R. White, 73, and John Paul Stevens,
70.

   Snow smothered two large Montana range and timber fires, but
authorities warned Monday that the warm, dry, windy weather that
nurtured the blazes could return by midweek.
   ``The potential for this thing to blow back up is really not
much affected by this snow,'' said Dave Turner, a Forest Service
information officer. He said it would take ``a lot more snow and
lot more moisture'' to snuff Montana's unusually late fire season.
   In Colorado, firefighters took advantage of a break in high
winds that reached up to 70 mph over the weekend to build a fire
line Sunday around the Olde Stage Road fire that swept across 2,200
acres in the rugged foothills northwest of Boulder. Officials said
they expected to control the blaze Monday.
   Boulder County sheriff's deputies arrested a man Saturday who
was accused of starting the fire by dragging a burning mattress
from his home.
   The two Montana fires, fanned by hurricane-force winds, charred
more than 40,000 acres of central Montana over the weekend, killing
cattle and sheep and destroying houses and ranch buildings. No one
was injured.
   The Turkey Fire burned across 32,000 acres near the
ranching-farming communities of Stanford and Hobson, southeast of
Great Falls, and continued burning in some timbered areas Monday.
Officials said some 433 firefighters and support personnel were
called in.
   The second, 10,000-acre blaze reached within a quarter-mile of
the tiny community of Bohemian Corners north of Lewistown,
officials said. It was extinguished early Monday.
   The Bohemian Corners fire was blamed for the loss of buildings
on two ranches. Losses in the Turkey Fire included 175 cattle, 50
sheep, stacks of hay, miles of fence, two houses and 13 other
outbuildings.

   Leftist guerrillas kidnapped three
American and two Colombian engineers at an oil field in
northeastern Colombia over the weekend, the state-run oil company
Ecopetrol said Monday.
   The Americans were working on a pilot project for a new way of
extracting oil, an executive at a private oil company said on
condition of anonymity.
   Al Smith, personnel director at NATCO, a Tulsa, Okla.-based
company, said the three Americans were employees of NATCO and that
two of them come from Tulsa and one from Bakersfield, Calif.
   ``As we understand it, it was a non-violent taking of these
gentlemen from the site where they were working,'' Smith said,
adding that there had been no demands for the men's release.
   He declined to release their names, but Ecopetrol spokesman
William Giraldo identified them as as Robert Hogan, Larry Sands and
John Bagbey. He said he could not confirm the spellings of their
names.
   More than 1,000 people have been kidnapped in Colombia so far
this year, officials say. Most of the blame falls on leftist
guerrillas, drug traffickers and common criminals looking for
ransom money.
   Two men and a woman belonging to the pro-Cuban National
Liberation Army abducted the American and Colombian engineers
Sunday afternoon near the town of Tibu, in North Santander
province, Giraldo said in a telephone interview.
   The rebels subsequently released one of the Colombians, who
delivered the news of the abductions, Giraldo said.
   The Colombian engineer who was not released, Ignacio Alonso, was
taken by the guerrillas to act as a translator, Giraldo said.
   The National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish acronym ELN,
has been attacking Colombia's oil infrastructure for years.
   Since 1986, the group has bombed the country's main oil pipeline
scores of times, causing an estimated $700 million in losses.
   The ELN is trying to pressure the government to reduce the
presence of U.S. and other foreign oil companies in Colombia.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel, meanwhile, on Monday freed one of
nine journalists it has kidnapped. The cartel recently offered to
surrender to Colombian authorities in exchange for deals with
prosecutors.
   Drug traffickers released magazine editor Juan Vitta because of
a heart problem that required medical attention, former Medellin
Mayor Juan Gomez said in a live radio interview. Gomez said he
talked briefly with Vitta after Vitta was freed in the northwestern
city of Medelin.

   The United States consulted with other
Security Council members Monday about a proposal authorizing
military force to liberate Kuwait. It sets a Jan. 1 deadline for
Iraqi withdrawal.
   The resolution would mark the second time in U.N. history that
the Security Council has authorized the use of force to counter
aggression. The first time was in 1950 in the Korean conflict.
   Kuwait, meanwhile, was preparing a presentation - including a
videotape - for the Security Council on Tuesday to describe Iraqi
atrocities since the Aug. 2 invasion, including the murder of
children and the looting of hospitals.
   The resolution would authorize ``member states cooperating with
the government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before Jan. 1, 1991,
fully implements the foregoing resolutions (calling for
withdrawal), to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the
Security Council resolutions passed in response to Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait, and to restore international peace and
security,'' according to the proposed text.
   The text of the resolution, obtained by The Associated Press,
says that despite all U.N. efforts ``Iraq refuses to comply with
its obligation'' to implement U.N. resolutions demanding withdrawal
from Kuwait ``in flagrant contempt of the council.''
   It cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use
of military force to counter aggression, if sanctions and other
steps fail.
   Foreign diplomats sai  they expect the proposal to be amended
before the vote later this week, noting some member states are
opposed to imposing a deadline for the withdrawal of Saddam
Hussein's troops from Kuwait.
   U.S. officials said Sunday the United States favors a Jan. 1
deadline but could be flexible about a later date to ensure broader
support. Other Western diplomatic sources said a later deadline
might be imposed to allow more time for negotiations.
   Judith Kipper, an associate at the Brookings Institute, a
Washington research group, said it would be a mistake for the Bush
administration to try to set a deadline.
   ``To put a date is to put his (Saddam's) back to the wall and
make things impossible,'' said Ms. Kipper, who just returned from
Baghdad where she met with the Iraqi president. ``If we go
public,'' she said, ``it's a guarantee that we'll have to go to
war.''
   The United States has the nine votes it needs to ensure passage
by the 15-member body, and the vote is likely to be held Thursday
or Friday. Opposition by any one permanent Security Council member
- the United States, Britain, China, France, or the Soviet Union -
could block the resolution, but a veto is considered unlikely.
   On Monday the United States consulted with the other four
permanent council members in an attempt to agree on final wording
of the resolution. Informal talks also were held with the other
council members.
   The United States is president of the council for the month of
November and U.S. officials want to secure a resolution on the use

<HEAD>Lawyer: War Criminal Klaus Barbie Allegedly Stricken with Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie has cancer
and needs special treatment from a French specialist, his lawyer
said Monday.
   Deputy Justice Minister Georges Kiejman said the request by
lawyer Jacques Verges amounted to an ``appalling media operation''
- a public relations ploy - and was unlikely to lead to Barbie's
early release from prison.
   Barbie, 77, was convicted of crimes against humanity in July
1987 and sentenced to life in jail following a lengthy trial in
Lyon, where he had served as Gestapo chief during the World War II
Nazi occupation.
   ``A sentence of life in prison is not a death sentence for lack
of care,'' said Verges, who defended Barbie in his trial.
   Verges said Barbie had suffered from cancer of the blood the
past three months, but did not specify whether it was leukemia.
Verges said Barbie, serving his sentence in Lyon's St. Paul Prison,
had been undergoing chemotherapy treatment the past month.
   Verges asked that top cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg
examine Barbie. Members of Schwartzenberg's family died in Nazi
concentration camps.
   The Justice Ministry said Verges had been sent a response ``of a
medical nature'' to his request that Barbie be examined by
Schwartzenberg. The ministry said the choice of doctor was up to
his treating physicians.
   ``I totally disagree with the principle of this operation,''
Kiejman said of Verges' effort to get Schwartzenberg to examine his
client.
   Kiejman said it was unlikely Barbie could now benefit from an
early release because of the reported illness.
   ``Medical pardons are always distributed with great parsimony,''
he told reporters. ``The only thing admitted is to put the dying in
contact with his family. According to the information I now have, I
don't believe we are in such a situation.''

   U.S. foreign relations have long been based on
a state of ``permanent crisis,'' but with the end of the Cold War,
the United States needs to reconsider its place in the world, Sen.
Daniel P. Moynihan said Monday.
   ``We have very little preconceived thoughts,'' Moynihan, a New
York Democrat, said as he opened the first of three hearings on the
enr. ``We want to make a record and keep this issue
before the Senate.''
   Moynihan, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that
the U.S. government has been shaped by three factd of the Cold Waors: the
emergence
of the president as commander-in-chief; the secrecy system, in
which much of what the executive branch does is unknown to Congress
and the public; and the so-called permanent crisis, which began
with the world wars and extended through the Cold War.
   Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, said he was dismayed that there has been no significant
public debate on what role the United States should play in the
post-Cold War world.
   ``The world and the American position in it is different now and
we have to respond to that,'' he said.
   Geo-economics will have a greater influence than geopolitics in
the future, and, as a result, we won't be choosing our alliese were 160

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury

   The Treasury Department sold $10.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.02 percent, down from 7.08 percent
last week. Another $10.1 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.96 percent, down from 7.05 percent last

   Mick Jagger has married his longtime girlfriend,
Texas model Jerry Hall, on the Indonesian island of Bali, the press
agent of the Rolling Stones singer said Monday.
   The wedding took place last Wednesday, said a spokesman for the
London public relations firm Laister Dickson. The couple are on
vacation in the Far East, he said.
   Few details of the ceremony were available, except that it was a
traditional Indonesian wedding, and the couple's two children,
Elizabeth, 6, and James, 5, attended, the spokesman said.
   ``Even we didn't hear about it until today, so they have clearly
managed to keep the wedding very secret,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Alan Dunn, Jagger's longstanding friend and the Rolling Stones'
tour director, was the best man, the spokesman added.
   British-born Jagger was divorced from first wife, Bianca, in
1979. They have one daughter, Jade, 19. Miss Hall has not been
married before.
   The couple have been together for more than 10 years.

<TEXT>
   Stanislaw Tyminski found out Monday that
becoming a real contender for Poland's presidency had one immediate
result: chaos.
   Journalists packed his press center, clamoring for specifics
about his economic program. Bodyguards tried to keep order. A
staffer painted her fingernails.
   His Peruvian wife, who speaks almost no Polish, was near tears.
   Tyminski, who left his homeland 21 years ago and returned only
this fall, scored a stunning election upset on Sunday when placed
second in balloting for the presidency. He will face Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa in a runoff on Dec. 9.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki finished a humiliating third,
behind Tyminski, and resigned Monday.
   Tyminski, a 42-year-old millionaire businessman, is an
incongruous sight in economically strapped Poland, with his aviator
glasses and fancy Italian suits.
   But the secret of his campaign success may have been his
promises that the wealth will rub off.
   ``After this victory I will roll my sleeves up, go to work and
make this country rich and prosperous. It will be better within a
month,'' he boasted at a news conference.
   ``My candidacy is not a political candidacy, it is an economic
one,'' he added in an interview.
   Tyminski - who holds Polish, Canadian and Peruvian citizenship -
says he left Poland penniless, going first to Sweden as a tourist
and then emigrating to Canada.
   He started a cable television outfit and a restaurant in the
Amazon port of Iquitos, Peru, and then returned to Canada, where he
runs Transduction Ltd., a computer automation firm near Toronto. He
leads the Libertarian Party of Canada, a tiny party that has no
representative in Parliament.
   For all his personal wealth, Tyminski is hard-pressed to outline
his solution to Poland's economic woes.
   ``Capitalism will start when people have disposable income,'' he
said, fidgeting. ``We must change the banking system, which is
Stalinist. We need to have better division of the budgets, like the
famous pie drawings.''
   Tyminski raised eyebrows in Poland with his free-spending
campaign, which he financed himself. Asked how much he spent, he
said he did not know.
   ``We have two boxes packed with receipts,'' he said, adding that
his wife, Graciela Perez, handled the campaign finances.
   On Monday, Mrs. Tyminski appeared distressed and distracted,
frequently blinking her eyes. She did not leave her husband's side.
Asked what she thought of the campaign, Mrs. Tyminski said in
English: ``It's interesting.''
   The couple have three children, and Tyminski also has a son by a
first marriage.
   In the course of the campaign, Tyminski became the subject of a
state prosecutor's slander investigation after accusing Prime
Minister Mazowiecki of treason for his economic policies.
   Tyminski assailed what he said were unfair press reports about
him during the campaign. He denied he was refused service into the
army as a youth because of mental illness, and dismissed reports he
traveled to Libya in the 1980s.
   The candidate also denied that he has called for the development
of nuclear weapons for Poland.
   ``I do not want the atom bomb in Poland,'' he said, adding
cryptically: ``But it saved my mother's life.'' He was apparently
referring to radiation treatments his mother received for cancer.
   He expressed confidence about facing the popular Walesa.
   ``I will win these elections,'' he said. ``I am not afraid of
Walesa, I am not afraid of anyone.''
   He said he looked forward to the next phase of the campaign, but
added that he wanted to concentrate on ``the country's future and
not my past.''

<TEXT>
   A federal advisory panel won qualified support
Monday for setting mathematical standards for students in specific
grades but was urged to measure achievement in ways that avoid
``invidious comparisons.''
   The National Assessment Governing Board heard testimony from
educators representing both public and private schools on its plan
to define what students in grades four, eight and 12 must know in
math to obtain one of three levels - basic, proficient and advanced
- when tested by the National Assessment of Educational Progress,
NAEP.
   Mandated by Congress, NAEP is the only nationally representative
and continuing assessment of what American students know and can do
in various academic subjects. The 24-member board sets policy for
NAEP, popularly called the Nation's Report Card.
   Normally NAEP tests simply describe how students perform without
judgement. If the proposed standards are approved, results of the
1990 NAEP test will be the first to measure students' actual
performance against established achievement standards.
   Frank Betts of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum
Development said the public must be cautioned against inappropriate
use of NAEP test results, which are based on sampling.
   ``Such comparisons, or rank ordering based on these data, are at
best misleading and at worst positively dangerous from the
statistical viewpoint,'' he said.
   Betts added, ``I believe there is a very real potential for
further harm in reporting three levels of achievement. My fear is
that the inappropriate use of ... data will lead to invidious
comparisons.''
   The 1990 math exam, to be released next year, is the first NAEP
assessment to provide state-level data on a voluntary basis in
eighth grade only. Each of 37 states in the trial state program
will have the option of using achievement levels to report results
in addition to the previous scoring system.
   Mary Johnson of the District of Columbia Public Schools
questioned the use of the terms ``basic, proficient and advanced''
in describing the achievement levels. If renamed proficiency levels
one, two and three, Johnson said, students might feel more positive
about their achievements at each level.
   Roy Truby, executive director of the board, acknowledged that
the ``board struggled with the notion that the three levels'' were,
in essence, tracking. Tracking is a controversial process in which
students are grouped based on academic performance. He added,
however, that ``the proficient level is the level we hope all
students will achieve.''
   Joyce McCray of the Council for American Private Education noted
a concern ``about the relationship between test content and
curriculum,'' but said the concept of three levels ``allows
flexibility and we all agree that appropriate achievement goals are
probably more easily defined in mathematics than in other areas of
the curriculum.''
   According to the board's resolution, ``proficient'' level for
each grade represents ``solid academic performance,'' while the
``basic'' level denotes ``partial mastery of fundamental knowledge
and skills. The ``advanced'' level signifies ``superior
performance,'' such as that needed at 12th grade to ``show
readiness for rigorous college courses.''

<TEXT>
   The two top British commanders in
the Persian Gulf on Monday predicted allied forces would defeat
demoralized Iraqi forces in ``days or weeks'' if war breaks out.
   Lt. Gen. Sir Peter de la Billiere and Air Chief Marshal Sir
Patrick Hine said the allies already have air and naval superiority
and will be able to match Iraq's ground forces once reinforcements
arrive.
   ``I think it will be a swift war ... days or weeks,'' de la
Billiere, the commander of British forces in the gulf, told a news
conference here.
   ``By removing the imbalance in ground forces ... we can win this
operation if it comes to it in the days and weeks that Gen. de la
Billiere has referred to,'' added Hine, the British-based joint
commander of the force.
   The commanders provided the first insight into allied thinking
since President Bush announced this month he was sending 200,000
more U.S. troops.
   De la Billiere said he meets daily with the U.S. commander, Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf.
   The fresh U.S. soldiers and 14,000 British reinforcements now
heading to the gulf will bring the multinational troop strength to
more than 500,000 by mid-January.
   Iraq currently has about 430,000 troops in and around Kuwait,
plus 250,000 reinforcements Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he
was dispatching.
   De la Billiere said Saddam will be taking ``a very severe risk''
by weakening his other borders to deploy more troops to Kuwait.
   ``If he were to take that risk and redeploy that number, then I
believe we will still have the forces in theater to fight a
decisive battle and bring it to a fairly speedy conclusion,'' the
general said.
   Iraq has sizable troop deployments along its borders with
Turkey, a NATO member, and with Iran, its foe during an eight-year
war that ended 1988.
   The British commanders said the allies hope to minimize
casualties by ``softening-up'' Iraqi ground forces with air and
artillery strikes before sending troops and tanks across the border
into Kuwait.
   ``I'm confident the softening-up process will be effective and
will enable any offensive operations, if we're asked to do them ...
to be conducted with a degree of initiative on our side and
assurance that we are not battering our head against a castle
wall,'' said De la Billiere.
   Some Iraqi defenses ``will certainly need tackling and dealing
with,'' he said, but barriers such as tank trenches filled with
gasoline aren't ``the sort of stuff that you stop armies with.''
   Hine said he hoped an operation could be done not to endanger
Western hostages, including some being kept as human shields at
strategic sites. But he added, ``It's not a driving
consideration.''
   ``I think they will look after these hostages well with an eye
to events after a war is all over,'' he said.
   The British commanders said they didn't want to underestimate
the fighting capability of the Iraqi army, especially its regular
forces, or the quality of some of its equipment.
   But de la Billiere said he wondered whether the Kuwaiti
occupation hadn't severely blunted the motivation of the Iraqi
troops because it has ``brought them nothing but deprivation at
home and distaste and dislike by the rest of the world.''
   ``I think many of them will feel they are fighting for a lost
cause - indeed they are,'' the general said.
   Hine said Saddam seems to be making policy week-by-week, in
response to reactions from various countries, with the aim of
dividing the allies and delaying any military action.
   ``When he can see that military action against him is perhaps
inevitable, then we may see some movement in terms of withdrawal or
partial withdrawal or something of that nature. At the moment, it
seems there's been no real force put on him ... to withdraw now,''
he said.
   Hine said a U.N. resolution with a deadline for an Iraqi
withdrawal might help focus Saddam's attention.
   At the United Nations on Monday, the U.S. consulted with other
Security Council members about a proposal authorizing military
force if Iraq has not withdrawn from Kuwait by Jan. 1.

   Ronald Reagan's autobiography is a
best-seller, but sales of the former president's memoir are lagging
those of ``Millie's Book,'' the dog's-eye-view of life inside the
Bush White House.
   ``Millie's Book,'' ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, was No. 3 on
this week's New York Times non-fiction best-seller list, five
notches ahead of the weightier Reagan book.
   The light-hearted canine narrative held down the No. 5 spot on
the Washington Post's best-seller list, while the former
president's 748-page memoir came in at No. 7.
   ``Millie's Book'' was brought out in September by William Morrow
&amp; Co. and has been perched on the best-seller charts for nine
weeks. ``An American Life'' by Reagan was published just three
weeks ago.
   ``It's a bit of an unfair comparison,'' Jack McKeown, publisher
of Simon &amp; Schuster's trade division, said Monday. ``We certainly
don't begrudge any success to `Millie's Book,' but they are
appealing to quite difference audiences.''
   Simon &amp; Schuster is the publisher of the $24.95 Reagan
autobiography.
   ``Millie's Book'' lionizes the president's English springer
spaniel, wrapping a droll narrative of White House life and lore
around scores of full-color pictures of Millie in the Oval Office,
Millie in the Lincoln Bedroom and Millie mingling with celebrities,
George, Barbara and assorted grandchildren.
   All the royalties from the $17.95 book are going to Barbara
Bush's literacy foundation. Mrs. Bush penned a similar book about
an earlier pet dog, C. Fred Bush, to raise money for charity when
her husband was vice president.
   Sales of the Reagan book are accelerating at the major book
chains and ``all the vital signs'' point to big sales of ``An
American Life'' as a Christmas gift book, said McKeown.
   But ``Millie's Book'' is winning the race at the bookstore
nearest the White House, a Crown Books outlet on G Street, one
block away.
   ``Millie's the hottest item in the store,'' said assistant
manager Larry Hoffer. ``It's out the door. People come in and buy
10, 15 each - and then come back and buy more. It's a really cute
gift idea.''
   Some of the mega-purchases are by people with White House
connections who can get the books ``signed'' by the first lady and
Millie, via a paw-print stamp.
   The Reagan book, which has received lackluster reviews, is
selling well at Crown, ``but not as fast as Nancy Reagan did,''
said Hoffer.
   The former first lady hit the best-seller lists last year by
lashing back at critics and ungrateful children in her life story,
``My Turn.''

<HEAD>Iraqi Sanctions Will Need Time to Work, Kuwaiti Minister Says</HEAD>

   U.N. sanctions against Iraq will take a long
time to work because the country's centralized economy allows
Saddam Hussein to shift needed resources easily, Kuwait's finance
minister said Monday.
   Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah also said Saddam has no compunction
about putting the needs of his military before those of the general
population.
   ``In a centralized economy, you can shift resources,'' Al-Sabah
said in a speech at the National Press Club. As a result, the
sanctions will succeed only ``over a very long period.''
   Sanctions virtually cutting off Iraq from the rest of the world
were imposed after Saddam invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Al-Sabah said the sanctions are also hurting Iraq neighbors -
countries that traded heavily with Baghdad in the past such as
Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, he said.
   Moreover, the world's less-developed economies are suffering
because the gulf crisis has produced an increase in the price of
oil, he said.
   ``The rest of the world is also suffering from sanctions,'' he
said.
   Al-Sabah's pessimism about the effectiveness of the U.N.-imposed
sanctions came as the United States prepared to ask the U.N.
Security Council to adopt a resolution that would authorize the use
of force against Iraq if necessary. U.S. officials have said a
draft resolution sets a Jan. 1 deadline for Iraq to get out of
Kuwait.
   The council's five permanent members, who have veto power, are
discussing the measure in New York. A vote could come Thursday
after debate this week.
   Al-Sabah said Kuwaiti officials are planning to recount to the
Security Council some of the atrocities that are occurring in their
country.
   Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait have shot and killed young men in
front of their families and raped the women, he said. The troops
have pilfered the country of medical and factory equipment and
stolen goods of every kind, including food, he added.
   Visitors to Baghdad have reported that stores in that city are
filled with canned goods from Kuwait, one of the reasons that
sanctions have yet to bite hard on the Iraqi people.
   So far, Iraq has shown little willingness to heed the U.N. or
Arab League resolutions that have called on Saddam to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   ``That leaves very little choice,'' he said.
   Al-Sabah's pessimistic remarks about sanctions underscored those
make Sunday by Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security
adviser, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.

<TEXT>
   U.S. concern over the Persian Gulf crisis has
produced the highest-level meeting between the United States and
Cuba since the two countries opened diplomatic offices in each
other's capitals 13 years ago, U.S. and Cuban officials said
Monday.
   Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmitt, the third-ranking
official at the State Department, met Sunday with the chief of
Cuba's diplomatic mission here, Jose Arbesu.
   Previously, the most senior U.S. official to meet with Cuba's
chief diplomat here has been the assistant secretary for Latin
American affairs.
   A spokesman at the Cuban mission said the Sunday meeting was
limited to a discussion of the consultations on the gulf at the
U.N. Security Council, of which Cuba occupies one of the 10
non-permanent seats.
   A U.S. official said Kimmitt extended an invitation to Cuba to
attend a Security Council meeting on the gulf set for Thursday.
   The United States has been pushing hard for a resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq.
   Cuba has expressed support for the restoration of Kuwaiti
sovereignty but also has called for efforts to find a peaceful
solution.
   The United States and Cuba consult periodically on immigration
and other issues but the Bush administration has ruled out the
possibility of normalizing relations with the island, accusing Cuba
of human rights abuses.
   The two nations broke off full diplomatic relations 30 years ago
this coming January.

<HEAD>American University President Wants to Remain on Faculty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former American University president Richard
Berendzen, who resigned after being charged with making obscene
telephone calls, said Monday he wants to remain on the faculty.
   Berendzen said Monday the controversy over a reported $1 million
buyout of his contract as president and as a tenured professor of
physics has caused him ``great anguish.''
   ``I am seeing the fabric of this family torn by rumor and
innuendo,'' Berendzen said in a statement issued through his
attorney. ``I have initiated steps that I hope will bring harmony
to the university I love so dearly.''
   He pleaded guilty in May to two charges of making obscene phone
calls in Fairfax County, Va., and received two 30-day jail
sentences, which were suspended on the condition that he remain in
psychiatric treatment.
   Berendzen said he was hopeful the board of trustees will approve
his return to teaching ``after an appropriate period of leave.''
   Last week, acting president Milton Greenberg asked the trustees
to rescind the buyout offer. He cited ``serious rifts'' which the
arrangement had caused between the trustees and the rest of the
university.

<HEAD>Court Backs Chiropractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday left intact
rulings aimed at prohibiting the American Medical Association from
boycotting chiropractors.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by the AMA
that its tactics did not violate federal antitrust laws.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Chicago last
February upheld a federal judge's order aimed at making it clear
that AMA members may associate professionally with chiropractors
without violating AMA ethical standards
   The case stems from a complaint filed by four licensed
chiropractors against the AMA in 1976. The chiropractors accused
the AMA of trying to drive them out of business by branding them as
quacks.
   Over the years, the AMA has settled other antitrust suits
brought by chiropractors and recently adopted a resolution that it
is ethical for members to associate professionally with
chiropractors.
   But a judge in the case of the four who sued in 1976 ordered the
AMA to take steps to eliminate ``lingering effects'' from the AMA's
boycott.
   The judge said the AMA must make its members aware they are free
to associate with chiropractors.
   The 7th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling that the AMA
failed to prove it was acting in the interest of patients when it
conducted the boycott.
   The case is AMA vs. Wilk, 90-542.

<TEXT>
   A defendant in the Central Park jogger trial
testified Monday that police hit, coached and deceived him to make
him confess to attacking a female runner who was gang-raped and
almost beaten to death.
   Kharey Wise, 18, also said detectives took him to a
blood-covered spot in the northern end of Central Park and told him
to dip his fingers into the woman's congealed blood and smear it on
his clothing.
   Defense lawyer Colin Moore said he called Wise as a witness to
try to convince the jury that police and prosecutors used
``Hitlerian tactics'' to make his client incriminate himself.
   Wise testified that Detective Robert Nugent slapped him and
called him a liar after the teen told of his whereabouts the night
of April 19, 1989.
   Wise said he had told police he left the park with another
teen-ager and had not attacked anyone.
   He said he gave police an incriminating statement after
Detective John Hartigan told him to lie to Nugent.
   ``Tell him that you were there. Put yourself in it,'' the
defendant quoted Hartigan as saying. ``I said, `If I tell him a
lie, can I go home?' He promised me I could.''
   Wise said he told Nugent he had seen the attack on the woman.
``Then I asked him, `Can I go home now?'''
   ``He looked at me and laughed,'' Wise said. ``He said, `You're
going straight to jail.'''
   In the second of two videotaped statements that have been played
in court, Wise implicated himself and others. He told police,
``This was my first rape, and it will be my last.''
   Wise and co-defendant Kevin Richardson, 16, are the second set
of teens to be tried on charges of rape, attempted murder, sodomy,
assault, robbery and riot in the attack on the female jogger and
two men.
   Thee others were convicted Aug. 18. All were sentenced to five
to 10 years in prison. Another youth will be tried early next year.
   The 30-year-old jogger, who testified at the trial, has
recovered from most of her injuries and has returned to work as an
investment banker. She said she still suffers vision and balance
problems and cannot smell.

   High winds whipped parts of Utah early Monday, causing power
outages in three communities, while snow blanketed mountains and
valleys.
   Snapped power lines darkened Snyderville, Summit Park and Kamas,
all east of Salt Lake City, for up to five hours late Sunday and
early Monday.
   The wind led off a fast-moving storm that brought snow and
colder temperatures to much of Utah. By noon Monday, the storm
dropped up to 2 inches on the valley floors, with at least 6 inches
in the mountains.
   High winds also blasted Arizona and California with gusts to 63
mph during the late morning at Show Low, Ariz., and 67 mph at
Daggett, Calif.
   Flood warnings remained in effect over the St. Joe and Coeur
D'Alene Rivers in northern Idaho, where several bridges and roads
were under water from previous flooding.
   Flood warnings also remained in effect for the Snoqualmie,
Snohomish, Skagit, Chehalis, Cowlitz, Cedar and White Rivers in
western Washington.
   At midday, rain extended over south central Arizona changing to
snow from central Arizona across northern Arizona, the mountains of
Utah, southeast Idaho, Wyoming, southeast Montana and northwestern
North Dakota, and over northwest Montana.
   Freezing rain fell over parts of Minnesota reaching into South
Dakota, changing to rain across southeastern South Dakota and
moving northeast to southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.
   Rain was scattered over central Indiana and central Alabama.
Showers and thunderstorms fell over Oklahoma and northern Texas.
   Monday morning's low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 11
degrees below zero at Cutbank, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 1 below
zero at Cutbank, Mont., to 88 at McAllen, Texas.

<HEAD>Finding Hitler's Art: One Woman Tries Classifieds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's an advertisement that
practically jumps off the page: ``Want to purchase any art work by
artist Adolf Hitler.''
   Hitler's name is in bold type, as if it needed to be.
   Betsy Gainey, a Wrightsville Beach real estate broker, placed
that ad in last Friday's Wall Street Journal as part of her
international search for Hitler's art.
   The German dictator was struggling to make it as an artist when
he began his political career.
   Ms. Gainey, who said she's working for an investor who doesn't
want to be identified, said she's already had ``quite a few'' calls
to her toll-free line - most of them from the curious.
   ``Very honestly, bluntly put, they're very nosy,'' she said. ``I
have had a couple people say they think they may know where some
is. Whether or not they can deliver, I don't know.''
   Ms. Gainey, who said she often takes such assignments, said her
investor wanted Hitler paintings for their artistic value.
   ``It's just someone who has the money who wants to invest for
the art value itself, not for the philosphy or whatever,'' said Ms.
Gainey, who professes no particular expertise in art.
   But Billy F. Price, a Texas compressor manufacturer who has made
an avocation of identifying Hitler artworks, says: ``Buyer
beware.''
   He said it's not too difficult to find watercolor landscapes
being sold as the late German dictator's creations. The problem is
detecting the real from the fake.
   ``It will be very, very unwise for a person to buy a (Hitler)
painting who doesn't check with some authorities,'' he said in a
telephone interview. Price published his own book in 1984, ``Adolf
Hitler: The Unknown Artist,'' in which he cataloged authentic and
fake Hitler paintings.
   Price says he often sees advertisements placed by people seeking
to buy or sell Hitler art and that many of them contact him.
   ``I got a fax the other day from Venezuela. This man wanted $3
million for a Hitler painting and said he would wait 48 hours
before he sold it to the Japanese,'' Price said. Price doesn't give
such offers much credence.

   The Bush administration's top military
officials - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell -
will be conspicuous by their absence Tuesday when the Senate begins
hearings on the buildup toward an ``offensive military option'' in
the Persian Gulf.
   The hearings, scheduled after President Bush decided to send an
additional 200,000 troops to the gulf, get under way with members
of Congress pressing for closer collaboration on gulf policy.
   However, Cheney and Powell will delay their appearances before
the Senate Armed Services Committee until next week, after U.N.
action on a resolution authorizing military force against Iraq.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel,
said Monday that Cheney is ``quite willing to testify before the
committee and will do so on Monday.''
   Powell also is scheduled to appear before the panel.
   After a meeting with the committee's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., Warner said Cheney had delayed his testimony until next
Monday ``to have a report from Secretary of State Baker on the U.N.
resolution.''
   Secretary James A. Baker III is in New York to press the United
Nations Security Council to approve military force to free Kuwait
if Iraq refuses to withdraw its troops. Baker is to testify on
Wednesday of next week before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., asked that the
House be called back from adjournment to discuss the U.N.
resolution, lest war be raging by the time Congress returns as
scheduled in January.
   Several congressional leaders, including Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole, asked earlier this month for a special session,
but that idea quickly died. And there was no indication of action
on Schroeder's request.
   The absence of Cheney from this week's witness list - and the
lack of any guarantee he would testify at all - had been portrayed
as a part of struggle between Nunn, a possible 1992 Democratic
challenger for Bush's job, and the White House.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of the committee, said in
an interview that the hearings were ill-timed and the
administration had every reason to wait before testifying.
   The timing, he said, ``is what you do when your purpose is more
political than policy. Not partisan politics, national politics.
The chairman is opening a presidential campaign,'' Wallop said
referring to Nunn.
   Nunn invited Cheney and Powell to appear before the panel nearly
two weeks ago to discuss the administration's policy since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The military leaders have had prominent roles in defending
Bush's decision to send the additional troops to the gulf to
provide a potential attack force. And many in Congress have said
the administration has yet to justify such a strategic shift.
   With Baker, Cheney and Powell unavailable until next week, the
witness list for this week's Armed Services sessions reads less
like a high-level policy consultation than like the lineup for
recent television talk shows.
   On Tuesday, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director James
Schlesinger will testify during a morning session with a closed
briefing by intelligence officials scheduled in the afternoon.
   Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen William J. Crowe Jr., and
David C. Jones will appear on Wednesday morning and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is scheduled to appear that
afternoon.
   Thursday's hearing includes former Navy Secretary James Webb,
former assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle and Edward Luttwak
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   Bush's announcement that he was greatly increasing the U.S.
deployment in the Persian Gulf - and adding the offensive
capability - touched off criticism by lawmakers, including Nunn who
said the administration had failed to justify a policy shift from a
defensive to offensive stance.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, a senior member of the House Armed
Services Committee sent a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., urging him to call back the House to debate the U.N.
resolution.
   Rep. Schroeder, who contended two weeks ago that it would be
useless for Congress to return in a special session to debate a
hypothetical action, said Monday a possible resolution makes a
session necessary.
   ``All of a sudden the time has come,'' Schroeder said in a
telephone interview. ``It would look awfully silly if we come back
and this thing is raging.''
   Congress included in its adjournment resolution in late October
a provision giving the Democratic leadership, in consultation with
the Republican minority, the authority to call Congress back in an
emergency.
   Schroeder said she did not think Congress would oppose the U.N.
resolution but ``we have to at least debate it.''
   Meanwhile, a delegation of 19 House members left on Sunday for a
weeklong visit to the Persian Gulf region.

   Moving men were hauling Margaret Thatcher's
belongings out of 10 Downing St. on Monday and the Western world's
longest-serving leader was shopping around for office space.
   Such is the banality and the swift brutality of the fall of a
British leader.
   ``I think she will write her memoirs, but at the moment I think
she could write the guide to fast house moving,'' Carol Thatcher,
37, said in a television interview after helping her mother pack
over the weekend.
   On Monday night, Mrs. Thatcher gave a party for the 200 staff at
Downing Street, ranging from cleaning people to her topmost
advisers, and declared, ``Life begins at 65 and I shall be working
for the future.''
   The party was possible because Mrs. Thatcher has longer than
most to vacate 10 Downing St. - the six to eight days it takes to
elect a new leader of the governing Conservative Party following
her decision last Thursday to step down.
   Her predecessor, James Callaghan of the Labor Party, had to get
out with less than a day's notice after Mrs. Thatcher led the
Conservatives to victory in a May 3, 1979, election.
   Within hours of the result being declared early on May 4, the
moving men arrived and Callaghan was gone shortly after midday.
Then Mrs. Thatcher moved in.
   The furniture, the silver plate, the chandeliers, the oil
paintings and most else at No. 10, a 17th century row house near
the Houses of Parliament, belong to the nation.
   But after 11{ years, the occupant gathers things besides
clothes. In Mrs. Thatcher's case they include boxes of personal
documents that may form the basis of a publisher's dream: the Iron
Lady's memoirs.
   There also are 1,000 bouquets of flowers sent by well-wishers
all over the world following Mrs. Thatcher's ouster as leader by
the Conservatives. Personal letters are coming in at more than
1,000 a day, aides say.
   Speculation about Mrs. Thatcher's future range from
tongue-in-cheek suggestions that she run a European bank to
becoming a countess and sitting in Britain's unelected and often
somnolent upper house.
   Her memoirs will be hot property and offers abound for lecture
tours.
   Aides say her priority is to find an office in central London
from where she may operate some kind of foundation to promote the
free-market political philosophy of Thatcherism.
   ``I don't think she has decided anything,'' a close aide said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Her preoccupation at the
moment is to get moved out of here into Dulwich and to get an
office.''
   Michael Gerson, head of the moving firm Mrs. Thatcher and her
husband, Denis, called in, estimates he can get most of it into one
large truck for the seven-mile journey to Dulwich, a southeast
suburban district.
   The Thatchers bought a double-storey house there in 1985 for
about 400,000 pounds, now the equivalent of $800,000. Mrs.
Thatcher, whose political tenets include home ownership, said it
was a hedge against the then-rapidly rising house prices in
southeastern England.
   Neighbors are ducking reporters and police are patroling the
suburban road. The security will remain a part of life for the new
resident, a permanent target of the Irish Republican Army.
   The Thatcher offices will be under guard, too.
   For now, her only office is one of the cramped rooms, sometimes
shared, allotted to a rank-and-file member of Parliament.
   It is not a role likely to suit her for long. ``She won't do a
Heath and stay there in sullen discontent,'' said a Thatcher aide,
referring to Edward Heath, now an ordinary MP, whom Mrs. Thatcher
ousted as party leader in 1975.
   Last week, the same party election rules that Mrs. Thatcher
turned against Heath brought her own career to an end.
   If Tuesday's vote is inconclusive among the three contenders for
the leadership, there will be a final ballot on Thursday.
   Mrs. Thatcher will move out the day after the winner is
declared.
   Meanwhile, it's farewell parties, flowers and some business as
usual.
   When President Bush telephoned Saturday to report on his visit
to the Persian Gulf, he caught Mrs. Thatcher sorting out the main
sitting room, her daughter said.
   An aide hastened in, Miss Thatcher added, saying, ``Drop that
packing case, prime minister, the White House is on the
telephone.''

Conservation Service.
   The post has been vacant since last summer with the resignation
of Wilson Scaling. The agency has nearly 14,000 employees and has
offices in all states, working with farmers to carry out soil and
water conservation programs.
   Richards, a graduate of Ohio State University, was named as one

<HEAD>Cavazos: College Is Still Affordable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, upset by
predictions that four years of college soon may cost several
hundred thousand dollars, urged colleges and universities Monday to
make ``tough choices'' to cut costs.
   Cavazos insisted that colleges still are affordable, although
tuition increases during the 1980s averaged about 8 percent a year.
Average tuition and fees for fall 1990 ranged from $884 at two-year
public colleges to $9,391 at four-year private colleges.
   Escalating costs of higher education have some analysts
predicting that ``four years of college early in the next century
may cost several hundred thousand dollars,'' said Cavazos.
   Cavazos stressed that the predictions are based on
``misperceptions about both the true cost of college and the
availability of student financial aid.'' Yet he released a
handbook, entitled ``Tough Choices,'' to help colleges examine
institutional goals and priorities and make decisions to control
spending.
   ``If we are to keep higher education affordable, colleges and
universities are going to have to make serious efforts to control
costs,'' he told reporters. ``Each institution must identify its
central mission and focus, and then allocate resources accordingly,
with the understanding that no single institution can do everything
well.''
   For example, Cavazos said colleges should consider merging
duplicative services or programs and possibly eliminating programs,
including certain athletic or sports programs. Institutions also
might consider coordinating services with nearby schools, he said.
   The handbook also advises school presidents to take the lead,
think long-term, involve the entire institution and communicate
well with all members of the institution's community.
   Cavazos also released a survey of college financial officials,
who said they could control expenditures more easily than they
could raise revenues. The college administrators cited as reasons
for raising tuition increased academic expenditures, declining
state contributions and the desire to improve the institution's
quality.
   According to the survey, institutions usually control
expenditures by delaying or modifying new construction, using more
part-time faculty or freezing hiring, imposing budget cuts and
cutting services.

<TEXT>
   An outsider's surprise second-place
showing in Poland's first popular presidential election has
provided a lesson in humility for the two quarreling camps of
Solidarity.
   Commentators conceded Monday they underestimated the depth of
public unhappiness with Western-prescribed economic reforms begun
during 15 months of non-Communist rule, and the credulity of a
public, most of whom were voting in their first democratic election
for president.
   Stanislaw Tyminski did not underestimate those factors. Now the
emigre Toronto businessman, who spent 21 years in Canada and Peru
and returned to his homeland only three months ago, is a step away
from being president.
   While the two halves of Solidarity represented by Lech Walesa
and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki were trying to bury each
other in an acrimonious battle for the presidency, a fresh-faced
unknown from abroad slipped in and nearly stole the electorate.
   ``The dark horse took advantage of a fight in the family,'' said
Dariusz Fikus, editor of the government paper Rzeczpospolita. ``It
is a defeat both for Walesa and Mazowiecki.''
   Walesa - founder of the East bloc's first independent trade
union, Poland's only Nobel Peace laureate and creator of the first
non-Communist government between the Elbe and the Pacific in 40
years - eked out 39.96 percent of Sunday's vote.
   Mazowiecki - who created a non-Communist government that began
the dismantling of the hated former system and won Poland respect
and praise abroad - drew only 18.08 percent.
   Tyminski won 23.10 percent based on his claim to be free of
politics and to be a millionaire and therefore an expert in
economic matters.
   Election returns showed he did best in rural areas and small
towns, where the benefits of a freer economy have so far been
negligible. Young people waiting for housing and miners worried
about their jobs also rallied to him.
   Voters new to democracy seemed to trust him because he looked
the part, with the sheen of a successful, self-made North American
executive. In the countryside, people were surprised to learn from
reporters that Tyminski is an unknown in his adopted country of
Canada, or that his Libertarian Party has no one in the federal or
provincial assemblies there.
   They distrusted last-minute criticisms of him in the press,
saying it reminded them of Communist propaganda campaigns.
   Tyminski was willing to articulate the rage felt by that part of
the population most immediately affected by the radical economic
reform program generally endorsed by both Solidarity candidates.
   Commentator Piotr Pacewicz wrote in Monday's Gazeta Wyborcza
that these people constituted a ``second Poland'' who found no
place for themselves in the Poland run by Solidarity. ``Had it not
been for Tyminski, they would probably have stayed home,'' he said.
   ``In Tyminski, this `second Poland' found a man who embodied
their hostility to the Solidarity state, someone clean, coming from
outside the alignment in which Communist memories are blending with
the hardship of radical reform.''
   Walesa told reporters after the election he had sensed a growing
anger and feared it would be exploited by ``a third force.'' He
said that's why he launched his campaign of ``acceleration'' so
that this disaffected bloc would not become alienated from
Solidarity forever.
   In its postmortems, the prime minister's camp was still pointing
a finger at Walesa - blaming him for fanning the anger.
   ``The `war at the top' unleashed by Walesa has led to this,''
groused Mazowiecki's election committee Monday in a half-hearted
recommendation to its supporters to oppose Tyminski.
   But in some ways, Mazowiecki was trapped in a vise between the
demands of Poland's foreign creditors and the limited patience of
his own people.
   Mazowiecki's tough economic reform policies were drafted last
fall in close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund,
which for years refused to unlock the door to desperately needed
new foreign credits until Poland got its economic house in order.
   The plan mandated a wage cap and a government-induced recession
that caused real wages to plummet 35 percent.
   Unemployment climbed from almost zero at the start of 1990 to
over 1 million today.
   Tyminski pledged a fast turnaround in the economy and accused
Mazowiecki of treasonous mismanagement of the economy - and wound
up collecting 1 million more votes than the prime minister.
   The returns and Mazowiecki's resignation Monday night as prime
minister may contain a cautionary lesson to the IMF and Western
countries who want to see democracy succeed in Eastern Europe:
   There is only so much austerity the West can realistically
expect the new democratic governments of Eastern Europe to impose,
and still remain the government.

<TEXT>
   Leona Helmsley, who has been trying to change
the public's perception of her as the mean hotel queen, presented a
$300,000 check Monday to the New York City chapter of the
Alzheimer's Association.
   With the donation, the association is establishing the Helmsley
Alzheimer's Alert Program, a regional network to locate, identify
and return people with Alzheimer's who wander from home and become
lost, according to Howard J. Rubenstein Associates Inc., the public
relations concern that represents Mrs. Helmsley.
   Carolina Edwards, a Rubenstein spokeswoman, said Mrs. Helmsley
became interested in efforts to find a cure for the disease through
her lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, whose mother suffers from the
progressive, irreversible disease characterized by degeneration of
the brain cells.
   ``She hooked into it personally with the Dershowitz family and
then Howard Rubenstein knew of her interest in Alzheimer's and
matched her up with this program,'' she said.
   The alert program is immediately available for the estimated
225,000 Alzheimer's victims in the New York City area. The program
will eventually expand to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington D.C.
   Participants in the alert program will wear a bracelet and
clothing emblem that will identify them by code and provide a
tollfree hot line number that anyone who spots them can call to
alert police.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 70, was convicted in August 1989 of billing
personal expenses to the Helmsley business empire. She is free on
bail pending her appeal.

   The Bush administration asked the Supreme
Court on Monday to kill a Texas businessman's lawsuit that alleges
government regulators caused the collapse of his healthy savings
and loan.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson said in oral
arguments before the court that allowing the lawsuit to be heard
could open the floodgates for scores of similar claims.
   In earlier written arguments, the government said that allowing
the case to go forward could also restrict regulators' options ``at
a time of urgent need for swift and flexible intervention.''
   Thomas M. Gaubert of Dallas alleges in his suit that negligence
by federal regulators who took over day-to-day operations of his
savings and loan, Irving-based Independent American Savings
Association, caused its financial ruin.
   The regulators forced Gaubert out of management in 1985 and
replaced directors in 1986. State authorities closed the thrift in
1987.
   ``They (regulators) just came in and lied to us, misled us and
for all practical purposes extorted us,'' Gaubert said following
the hearing. ``We had no right to have any say in it.''
   Gaubert, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who persuaded former
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Fort Worth, to intervene with federal
regulators on his behalf, is seeking compensation for $25 million
worth of real estate he lost when his S&amp;L failed.
   ``We have not had our day in court,'' said Gaubert's attorney,
Abbe David Lowell. When the case is heard, he claimed, ``the facts
will show these people (regulators) took unbelievably negligent
actions.''
   The high court is expected to rule on the case by July.
   The government contends that regulators seeking to restore a
thrift to safer and sounder management practices are immune from
such claims.
   While the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that
Gaubert can pursue is claim for $25 million, it did not let him
continue his bid to collect from the government the $75 million
lost value of his Independent American shares.
   Gerson told the court that the Justice Department has 132 cases
stemming from the savings and loan crisis that seek damages from
the government. But Lowell said only one is actually in the courts.

   The Army on Monday ordered 10,567 National
Guard combat troops to report for active duty Friday in support of
Operation Desert Shield, and it said dozens of other reserve units
have been alerted for possible noncombat duty.
   The combat forces called up, which were alerted Nov. 16 that
they would be activated, are the first units among the Army's
reserve combat forces to be activated in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   More than 45,000 other Army citizen-soldiers put on active duty
since August are in non-combat roles such as transportation or
medical services. The Army said Monday it had alerted an
unspecified number of National Guard and Army Reserve members from
30 states and Puerto Rico that they may be called up soon for
non-combat duty in Desert Shield.
   Separately, the Marine Corps disclosed that it is sending to the
gulf the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, a regular unit of about
15,000 Marines based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Three Marine
expeditionary brigades already are in the gulf area and the
Pentagon announced Nov. 8 that the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade
of Camp Pendleton, Calif., was heading there.
   Maj. Nancy J. LaLuntas, a spokeswoman at Marine Corps
headquarters, said the 6th Brigade would link up in Saui Arabia
with a squadron of ships carrying equipment and 30 days of supplies
from Norfolk, Va.
   The Army said the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Georgia
and the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana were
ordered to report for active duty Friday. Also reporting will be
two smaller combat units, the 1st Battalion of the 263rd Armor from
Mullins, S.C., and a battalion of the 152nd Armor from Oneonta,
Ala.
   The Army gave no other details, but officials said last week
that the Georgia brigade and the Mullins battalion would form an
``independent'' unit for possible deployment with the 24th Infantry
Division (Mechanized), a regular Army division from Fort Stewart,
Ga., already is in Saudi Arabia.
   The Louisiana brigade and the Oneonta battalion are to bring to
full strength the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) of Fort Polk,
La., a regular Army division that the Pentagon last week said may
be sent to Saudi Arabia.
   The announcement made no mention of the 155th Armored Brigade of
Mississippi, a National Guard combat unit that the Army last week
said would be ordered to active duty and be made part of the 4th
Infantry Division (Mechanized) of Fort Carson, Colo., a regular
division that has not yet been deployed to Saudi Arabia.
   About 130,000 Army troops already are deployed in Saudi Arabia
as part of a 230,000-strong U.S. military force that President Bush
has said may be used to try to liberate Kuwait. Additional U.S.
forces of up to 200,000 are heading to the gulf.
   Bob Harper, spokesman for the Mississippi Army National Guard,
said the 155th was told by the Defense Department last Friday to
expect to be activated about Dec. 7.
   Harper speculated that the 155th was not activated at the same
time as the two other Guard brigades because the Army's National
Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., cannot handle all three
brigades at the same time. The brigades are to undergo desert
warfare training at Fort Irwin before the Pentagon decides whether
they are proficient enough to be deployed to Saudi Arabia.
   The 141st Infantry Battalion of McAllen, Texas is expected to be
activated with the 155th of Mississippi, although it was not
included in Monday's announcement.

   A woman known as the ``Dragon Lady'' of New
York Harbor was sentenced to five years' probation Monday for
fouling the harbor with sewage sludge.
   Evelyn Berman Frank had pleaded guilty in July to unlawful
abandonment and release of the sludge - some of it toxic - in New
York Harbor in 1987 and 1988.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Iuliani ordered the 75-year-old
Frank family matriarch to cut all ties with the web of family-owned
sludge-hauling companies she has run for 25 years.
   Mrs. Frank could have been sentenced to up to 10 years in
prison, but the judge said he declined to incarcerate her because
of her age and medical problems. Iuliani also ordered Mrs. Frank to
perform 500 hours of community service each year for the next five
years, a total of 2,500 hours.
   One of the Frank companies, General Marine Transport Inc.,
presented a check to the state at the hearing for $500,000, half of
a $1 million fine levied on it as part of the plea agreement.
   For decades Mrs. Frank has controlled a complicated marine
empire of more than 45 interlocking concerns.
   Competitors and employees dubbed her the ``Dragon Lady'' for her
sharp tongue and aggressive management style. She, in turn,
christened one of her tugboats The Dragon Lady.
   The Frank family's environmental violations date back to at
least 1970, but drew widespread attention only in September, after
the decrepit Sarah Frank barge dumped more than 40,000 gallons of
waste oil into the Kill Van Kull near Staten Island.

<TEXT>
   Mick Jagger has married his longtime girlfriend,
Texas model Jerry Hall, on the Indonesian island of Bali, press
agents for the Rolling Stones singer said Monday.
   The couple were married Wednesday in ``an Indonesian wedding
ceremony,'' after a six-week vacation touring the Far East, said
spokeswoman Lori Somes of the New York publicity firm Rogers and
Cowan Inc.
   She said Jagger and Hall's two children, Elizabeth, 6, and
James, 5, attended the wedding. The couple's best man was Alan
Dunn, a friend of Jagger's who has been a Rolling Stones tour
director.
   ``Even we didn't hear about it until today, so they have clearly
managed to keep the wedding very secret,'' added a spokesman for
the London public relations firm Laiser Dickson, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   British-born Jagger was divorced from first wife in 1979. Miss
Hall has not been married before.
   It was not immediately clear whether Jagger and Hall were joined
by Jagger's other two daughters, Jade, 17, from his marriage to
former model Bianca Perez Morena de Macias of Nicaragua, and Karis,
18, by U.S. actress Marsha Hunt.
   Jagger, 47, and Hall, 34, have been together 12 years, sharing
homes in New York, France and the remote Caribbean island of
Mustique.
   There long has been speculation over their marriage plans.
   As long ago as 1983, Jagger announced they would be tying the
knot ``any day now.''
   But in February, Jagger laughed off questions about his
intentions. ``My marital status will not be changing in the
near-future,'' he said in an interview.
   Around the same time, Hall made her West End acting debut,
playing a nightclub singer in a revival of ``Bus Stop,'' the part
Marilyn Monroe made famous in the 1956 movie.
   Hall, who has been a successful model, was quoted in British
newspaper reports at the time as saying: ``We have agreed (on
marrying), only the time and the place have to be set.''
   She was reported to have said that during the years they had put
off marrying, she and Jagger had watched friends marry and divorce.
   ``We say, `OK, even though we didn't get married, we've lasted
longer than most,''' she said.

   The water went back where it came from Monday but
hundreds of people stayed away from the homes they fled over the
weekend after heavy rains caused the second ruinous floods in two
weeks.
   One man was presumed dead in the deluge. A pontoon bridge
linking Seattle and its eastern suburbs sank. Many residents had
just managed to return home and start cleaning up earlier damage
when the new rainstorms hit.
   At least 2,600 people were evacuated as 20 rain-swelled rivers
spilled their banks, authorities said. Most of the flooding
occurred west of the Cascade Mountains, which form the north-south
spine of the state, inundating much of western Washington. Hardest
hit were rural areas.
   More rain but in less quantity was forecast for Monday night and
Tuesday.
   ``Except for the Chehalis River, the worst is over,'' said Dick
Milne, spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management.
   A flood surge was moving down that river toward Grays Harbor on
the coast, and officials feared more evacuations downstream would
be necessary.
   At least six rivers set records for high water. State officials,
who already tallied more than $40 million in flood damage earlier
this month, said that figure would soar. They had no new figures
yet.
   A storm that dumped a record 3{ inches of rain on Seattle in two
days was blamed for the collapse of the old Lake Washington
floating bridge, which was being renovated into the new eastbound
lanes for Interstate 90.
   About 2,100 feet of the four-lane, 8,600-foot-long bridge sank
in 200 feet of water Sunday morning. Bridge debris severed some
cables anchoring the new, seven-lane I-90 bridge, 60 feet north of
the old structure.
   State engineers closed the year-old bridge and said it would be
reopened only after temporary replacement cables are installed.
   The bridge is a chief artery linking Seattle to populous suburbs
to the east, handling 110,000 vehicles a day. On Monday, drivers
accustomed to a 12-mile commute between Bellevue and Seattle were
forced to endure a clogged, 30-mile detour.
   King County police said Scot Alan Scott, 28, of Duvall, was
missing and presumed drowned Sunday after he drove past a barricade
on a county road, left his stalled car and tried to walk through
high water. He was swept into the Snoqualmie River. His wife and
their 6-month-old son were rescued from the river by firefighters.

   The nation's former chief S&amp;L regulator
testified Monday that his 1987 meetings with five senators, now
subjects of an ethics investigation, capped ``years of private
threats'' designed to stop banking officials from curbing
high-flying thrift institutions.
   Edwin J. Gray only had time to read a 13-page opening statement
at the Senate Ethics Committee hearings into the five senators'
ties to former S&amp;L operator Charles H. Keating Jr.
   But he immediately set the stage for confrontation with the
senators by declaring that he was trying to stop risky investments
by instutitions like Keating's failed Lincoln Savings and Loan -
while powerful politicians were trying to stop him on Keating's
behalf.
   Gray did not go into details on the conduct of the senators:
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   But his testimony starting Tuesday will be crucial in
determining whether the senators made improper demands of
regulators on behalf of Keating, a political contributor to all
five.
   Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
that his meetings with the five senators in April 1987, when they
intervened for Keating, ``capped years of private threats and
public vilification designed not just to change particular
decisions by the bank board but to render us unable to carry out
our central responsibilities.''
   ``No one in Washington with the slightest knowledge of this
issue can have been ignorant of this situation or the effect it
would have on the way the regulators received and interpreted
messages from senators and congressmen.''
   Gray is a crucial witness because because of his House Banking
Committee testimony a year ago that DeConcini offered a deal on
Keating's behalf when he, Cranston, Glenn and McCain met with him
on April 2, 1987. DeConcini has vigorously denied proposing a deal.
   Earlier, an aide to DeConcini said her boss once asked her if
there was a way to ``bring heat'' on Gray.
   Nearly four months later, the aide said, she told DeConcini it
could be politically disastrous for him to intervene on Keating's
behalf with Gray, but he ``thanked me for my suggestion and said he
was going to go ahead anyway.''
   DeConcini's aide on banking issues, Laurie A. Sedlmayr,
testified on the fifth day of Ethics Committee hearings.
   Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office
and that DeConcini also wanted him replaced.
   DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press
accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray
and asking, ``Anything we can do to bring heat?''
   She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably
unnecessary'' for him to take action and suggesting the senator
``stay out of this.'' Sedlmayr said Keating was more aggressive
than many other businessmen she dealt with.
   ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn't
comfortable with that,'' she said.
   ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the
case,'' she added.
   Keating contributed $1.3 million to the campaigns and favorite
causes of the Keating Five senators, much of it while he was
battling thrift regulators during an intense examination of his
Lincoln Savings and Loan. The institution was seized by regulators
in April 1989 and it could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to
cover the losses.
   Asked by committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett what advice
she gave her boss before the April 2, 1987, meeting with Gray, Ms.
Sedlmayr said: ``I told him I didn't think it was a good idea ...
politically it was a mistake.''
   The aide said she was concerned that word of the meeting would
leak to the news media - a prediction that came true - and that
``Mr. Gray would misrepresent that meeting.''
   Ms. Sedlmayr also was the second senatorial aide to back
Bennett's assertion that Riegle was far more involved than he
acknowledged in organizing the April 2 meeting with Gray - and a
meeting April 9, 1987, between all five senators and the regulators
examining Lincoln. McCain aide Gwendolyn van Paasschen said last
week she believed Riegle was involved in setting up the meetings.
   While Riegle has denied organizing the meetings, Sedlmayr said
she understood from DeConcini that the first one meeting with Gray
was Riegle's idea.
   She described herself as disturbed that DeConcini told her to
write Riegle a letter inviting him to the April 9 meeting.
   ``It was sort of, why are you doing this - he is just as
interested in this issue as we are,'' she said. Ms. Sedlmayr wrote
in a chronology she prepared in December 1988 that each of the
meetings was ``the brainchild of Sen. Riegle'' and he had asked for
the letter of invitation to ``cover himself'' to explain his
attendance on April 9.
   Riegle said he went to the April 9 meeting with the San
Francisco-based regulators because of his expertise on the Banking
Committee, of which he is now chairman.
   Under cross-examination by Riegle attorney Thomas Green, Ms.
Sedlmayr said ``I was being flip'' when she wrote that the meetings
with regulators were the brainchild of Riegle.
   When Green asked her whether Riegle's suggestion that senators
concerned about Lincoln meet with Gray was ``rather conventional,''
she responded that it was.
   Ms. Sedlmayr also told Green she had no reason to doubt that
DeConcini wanted Riegle at the meeting with Gray because Riegle was
an expert on banking matters.

   The State Department has sent a survey team to
Lebanon to determine whether it is safe for American diplomats to
return to that country, the department said Monday.
   A spokesman said the administration hopes to return diplomats
``when we can be reasonably assured of their safety and
effectiveness.'' The survey team arrived Sunday. It will not
conduct diplomatic business.
   Former U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy closed the embassy more
than a year ago. A new ambassador, Ryan Crocker, was sworn in
recently but has remained in Washington.
   The State Department began re-evaluating the security situation
in Lebanon last month after Syrian forces crushed the 11-month

   A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues
in the CNN-Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness
could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone
conversations.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in
warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free
$20 million in frozen Noriega-linked bank accounts to pay defense
lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the
money was drug-tainted.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' Hoeveler said. ``There's an obvious need by all of us
in a case like this to show that our system, in fact, does work
from top to bottom.''
   On the tapes issue, the judge said transcripts of tapes handed
over by Cable News Network last week were expected to be completed
by late Monday, and will be discussed by all sides in a closed
hearing Wednesday morning.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Thursday on whether to maintain
his order preventing the network from broadcasting the tapes made
of calls the former Panamanian leader made from his prison cell
outside Miami.
   The judge emphasized he would review all CNN's tapes, not just
those between Noriega and his lawyers. He said an 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals opinion upholding his original gag order allowed
him to consider ``broader questions'' than attorney-client
privilege.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock protested, saying the issue should
not include matters such as pretrial publicity because the defense
had not asked for such a ruling.
   Outside the court, he said he was alarmed by the judge's
comments.
   ``It's bad enough that the court's engaging in this process of
pre-publication review,'' he said. ``But it's more disturbing that
the court is going broader than even the litigants are seeking.''
   Noriega's lawyers were pleased with the handling of the tapes,
however.
   ``How the devil can he ever receive a fair trial ... if CNN's
going to play his innermost, private discussions with his lawyers
planning his defense strategy,'' said Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead
attorney.
   In the second part of Monday's hearing, the judge said he would
postpone appointment of government-paid lawyers to replace Rubino's
defense team to give the government another chance to unfreeze
Noriega's foreign bank accounts.
   Prosecutors agreed in June to free the money, but later said
foreign governments had stepped in by filing their own confiscation
orders against the 27 accounts.
   Hoeveler said he would order a hearing on the frozen accounts
within 10 days to determine if the money was illegally earned.
   Noriega is facing up to 145 years in prison on a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect and facilitate their
U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami.

<HEAD>Protest Over Fare Hike Ends at Easter Island, Air Strip Cleared</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Easter Island's only landing strip was
cleared by protesters Monday after the sole airline operating there
temporarily agreed to end a fare increase to mainland Chile, the
government reported.
   LAN, the privately owned Chilean carrier, announced it was
postponing its fare hike until Jan. 1.
   The protesters had blocked the remote Pacific island's only
runway on Friday night, preventing the takeoff of a LAN Boeing
aircraft with 108 passengers aboard just before it was to fly on to
Tahiti.
   LAN President Jose Luis Moure said the fare increase would be
frozen until the new year, and then would be gradually implemented.
   LAN, the only airline operating to the volcanic island 2,300
miles west of Santiago, had announced it would increase its
roundtrip fare for residents from $206 to $410. The fare is 40
percent lower than that applied to visitors coming to see the
island's huge stone carvings and famed hieroglyphs.
   Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said the landing strip at
Mataveri airport was cleared by midafternoon Monday, allowing the
LAN plane to take off.
   An air force plane landed from Santiago carrying a group of
government officials for further discussions with the islanders,
Krauss said.
   The island has about 1,900 residents.

   A former school administrator has
confessed that he killed his ex-girlfriend, ending an 11-year-old
murder mystery.
   Francis Malinosky, 45, appeared in Chittenden Superior Court
Monday and told a judge what police and the victim's family had
long suspected: He killed schoolteacher Judith Leo-Coneys in
November 1979.
   ``I am ashamed of myself right down to the very center of my
being,'' Malinosky said, admitting his crime to District Judge
Frank Mahady.
   As part of a plea bargain, Malinosky last week led police to
Leo-Coneys' body, which had never been found. The corpse, covered
in plastic, was located in a 2-foot-deep grave off a logging road
in Cabot.
   An autopsy showed Leo-Coneys had been shot.
   In return for Malinosky's cooperation, the state reduced its
charge against him from first-degree murder to voluntary
manslaughter. The plea agreement called for a 10- to 15-year prison
sentence, with all but five of those years suspended. He could be
released from prison as early as late 1993.
   Mahady weighed whether to accept or reject the plea agreement
for more than an hour.
   ``The penalty contemplated in the agreement simply doesn't fit
the offense,'' the judge said on returning to the bench.
   But he said he accepted it because ``it accomplished important
goals that could not have been accomplished in any other way. It
resolved what happened 11 years ago.''
   ``We settled for half a loaf but half a loaf is much much better
than none,'' said Chittenden County State's Attorney William
Sorrell. ``There was enough uncertainty about what might happen at
the hands of a court or the hands of a jury that it made sense on
both sides to try to reach an agreement.''
   Malinosky was arrested in April in a Los Angeles-area motel,
where he had been staying under an alias. He claimed then that he
was the victim of a ``small-town witch hunt.''
   Malinosky was an assistant director of special education for the
Burlington schools and Leo-Coneys was a Milton special education
teacher when their two-year relationship ended in the summer of
1979. The breakup reportedly left Malinosky distraught, his
attorney said.
   Leo-Coneys, 32, disappeared Nov. 5, 1979, after going to
Malinosky's home to pick up her personal belongings.
   Malinosky had been a suspect from the beginning, but police were
never able to connect him with Leo-Coneys' disappearance, police
said. Several diggings around his house failed to uncover any
evidence.
   As the investigation accelerated, Malinosky disappeared in
December, and wandered the country using a host of aliases, police
said.
   In 1989, Sorrell took over as state's attorney and, after
reading the case file for three days, reopened the case.
   ``I was convinced when I looked at the file that he had murdered
her,'' Sorrell said. ``It bothered me that this guy was getting
away with murder.''

   The foreign minister of this small
South American nation resigned Monday after one of his sons was
charged with marijuana possession.
   A government statement released Monday said Rashleigh Jackson
resigned his ministry post after learning his son Martin and a
female companion were charged with possessing four grams of
marijuana.
   The statement said President Desmond Hoyte ``accepted his
resignation reluctantly'' and would temporarily take over as
foreign minister.
   Jackson, who had been minister more than a decade, has been
beset by personal problems since his British-born wife drowned two
years ago. Friends said the death had a devastating effect on
Jackson.
   His son faces a mandatory four-year jail sentenced if found

   ``Home Alone,'' the lightweight story of an
abandoned offspring, is crushing the competition at movie theaters
nationwide, appealing to children and adults from big and small
cities alike.
   The family comedy's stunning box-office haul - $28.7 million
over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend - is all the more remarkable
because many of the admissions are discounted for children. As of
Monday, the film has grossed $48.3 million in two weeks of release.
   In a movie season loaded with adult fare such as ``Predator
II,'' ``Jacob's Ladder'' and ``Reversal of Fortune,'' ``Home
Alone'' appeals to all audiences, its box-office revenues indicate.
   Over the holiday weekend, parents wanting to take their children
to the movies chose ``Home Alone'' overwhelmingly, 20th Century Fox
said.
   The movie stars Macaulay Culkin as 8-year-old Kevin McCallister,
accidentally left behind at Christmas when his family leaves for a
Paris vacation. While at home, the youngster defends the residence
from two bumbling burglars.
   ``Home Alone'' was written and produced by John Hughes and
directed by Chris Columbus.
   ``Everyone seems to be coming and we're getting a lot of repeat
business,'' said Tom Sherak, head of marketing and distribution for
Fox.
   ``It doesn't matter where you are. There's not a weak spot in
the entire country - small cities or big cities,'' Sherak said.
``We look at some of the (box-office) grosses from some of those
small cities and wonder where the audiences will come from the next
day.''
   The movie can be seen in 1,284 theaters nationwide, and more
theaters may be added this week, Sherak said.
   To build an audience for ``Home Alone,'' Fox screened the film
in sneak previews Nov. 10. Originally set to open on Nov. 21, its
release was moved up four days so it would not compete head-to-head
with the family-oriented ``Three Men and a Little Lady.''
   CinemaScore, a movie testing service, says ``Home Alone'' has
scored as high as the year's hits ``Ghost'' and ``Pretty Woman.''
   A survey of about 450 patrons of ``Home Alone'' in Las Vegas and
St. Louis found that 82 percent said it deserved an A grade. The
majority of moviegoers under age 25 said ``Home Alone'' merited an
A-plus, said CinemaScore's Ed Mintz.

   Two Minnesota brothers and their two
Soviet companions pedaled up to the state Capitol Monday to
complete a 13,000-mile round-the-world bicycle tour that began
eight months earlier.
   ``We couldn't be happier,'' 30-year-old Dan Buettner of
Minneapolis told family members, supporters and reporters who
turned out on a cold, drizzly morning to welcome the team.
   ``We went through a hurricane and earthquakes and floods, and we
had the salmonella sicknesses. At times we didn't think we were
going to make it, and we knew a lot of folks back here were
watching us and rooting for us, and that's really what kind of kept
us going.''
   His brother Steve, 25, of Roseville, said: ``I feel fantastic.
This is the happiest day of my life.''
   The Buettners and Soviet bikers Vladimir (Volodya) Kovalenko,
32, and Alexander Razumenko, 31, began their journey April 1.
   The foursome's goal was to circle the globe, following as
closely as possible the 45th parallel, and to get credit in the
Guinness Book of World Records as the first people to cycle across
the Soviet Union. The trip took the four to Novosibirsk, Siberia,
the Soviet bikers' hometown.
   The 7,353-mile stretch across the Soviet Union took 125 days. A
spokesman for the team said Guinness is going over the
documentation to verify the record. Dan Buettner already holds a
Guinness record for cycling from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
   Buettner said the most challenging part of the trip was in the
far eastern part of the Soviet Union.
   ``The roads came to an end,'' he said, ``and we had about 800
miles where we pushed our bicycles along footpaths and through the
mud and knee-deep bogs. When things got really bad, we went up to
the trans-Siberian railway and pushed our bikes along it. That was
probably the toughest part. We were drinking water out of mud
puddles and we were eating buckwheat and Chinese pork fat.''
   Physically, the trip was ``not so difficult,'' said Razumenko,
although Dan Buettner disagreed.
   ``It's easy for Alexander to say it wasn't so tough because he's
been to Antarctica and the North Pole and for him bicycling is
probably easy,'' said Buettner, who lost 18 pounds during the
journey.
   The Buettners met Razumenko and Kovalenko through a suburban
Minneapolis group called CONNECT U.S.-U.S.S.R., which arranges
visits and business transactions between the two countries. The
largest sponsor of the $30,000 trip was 3M Co. of St. Paul. Raleigh
Bicycle Corp. of America donated the off-the-rack mountain
bicycles.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki resigned
Monday along with his government a day after a political neophyte
dealt him a humiliating defeat in presidential elections.
   ``Poland's painful but necessary program of getting out of
economic catastrophe can only be realized with the understanding of
the majority of the nation,'' said Mazowiecki, the first
non-Communist prime minister in the East bloc. ``Society made its
choice.''
   He had come in third in presidential elections Sunday, failing
to qualify for a runoff with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who
finished first.
   Mazowiecki was knocked out of the race by Stanislaw Tyminski, a
wealthy businessman who returned to Poland this fall after 21 years
in Canada and Peru.
   ``I will win these elections,'' an optimistic Tyminski told
supporters and the curious at his Warsaw headquarters. ``I am not
afraid of Walesa, I am not afraid of anyone.''
   Walesa said Tyminski's success was an ``accelerated lesson in
democracy.''
   Mazowiecki, 63, took office in August 1989 and spearheaded
Eastern Europe's most ambitious economic reforms and won
international acclaim for his historic role in the democratization.
   But the election results made clear his inability to head off
discontent among ordinary Poles, particularly those in the
countryside, suffering through inflation, unemployment and
widespread uncertainty after four decades of Communism.
   ``The vision of creating a Polish democracy and a healthy
economy that my government served has been questioned,'' Mazowiecki
said.
   He told state radio he and his government could not be
responsible ``for promises made by the other candidates.''
   Mazowiecki announced he will submit his government's formal
resignation to Parliament. The government will continue only in a
caretaker role until a new one is formed following the Dec. 9
runoff, Mazowiecki said.
   It was the first time Poles voted for a president by popular
election. In the past, both under Communist rule and before World
War II, presidents were elected by the Parliament.
   News of Mazowiecki's resignation drew an angry reaction from
Walesa, who had tapped him for the post of prime minister, then
split with him over the pace of reforms in the post-Communist era.
   ``That's great responsibility,'' Walesa said sarcastically,
contacted at home by The Associated Press. ``Now, let the Poles see
this responsibility, this patriotism and this democracy of
Mazowiecki.''
   He later told state television that the resignation would be
``complicating things,'' but he hoped ``calm will prevail and
everything will end up well.'' He added he would try to ``sew up''
Solidarity.
   Tyminski, 42, who was not taken seriously by other candidates
until polls indicated a late surge of support, promised to make
Poland prosperous and assailed the Mazowiecki government as
incompetent.
   Tyminski's promises of wealth were particularly alluring to
voters worn down by economic reforms launched by Mazowiecki.
   With Mazowiecki's resignation, a new prime minister presumably
would be nominated to Parliament by the new president.
   Both the Mazowiecki and Walesa camps expressed shock at
Tyminski's showing.
   Walesa, at his Solidarity union office in Gdansk, called
Tyminski ``an accident in Polish democracy'' and said he was not
``a serious man.''
   With all 49 provinces reporting, Walesa had nearly 40 percent of
the vote, Tyminski 23 percent and Mazowiecki 18 percent; three
minor candidates split the rest, according to election commission
results collected by the official news agency PAP. Turnout was put
at 61 percent.
   Walesa, the shipyard worker who marshaled the forces that ended
Communist rule, had hoped for a huge mandate in Sunday's vote. He
had said earlier it would be ``horrible'' to face Tyminski in the
second round of balloting.
   ``I must say I am hesitating,'' he said Monday, but added: ``One
has to think over what is good for Poland.''
   One newspaper commentator attributed Tyminski's strong showing
to support from ``a second Poland'' of disaffected rural and
small-town voters who are looking for quick answers to their
country's difficulties.
   The major candidates and the press underestimated their numbers,
Piotr Pacewicz wrote Monday in the country's largest newspaper,
Gazeta Wyborcza.
   He said Tyminski profited from being an outsider ``who came from
the world of success, from the Americas, and who was not a part of
the world of politics.''
   Tyminski was also the beneficiary of a split in Solidarity,
which held together and battled Communism for more than a decade
but then broke into separate camps supporting and opposing Walesa
and differing over the pace of economic reforms.
   There was no indication whether Mazowiecki would throw his
support to Walesa, or what his backers would decide. Mazoweicki
vowed to continue the ``the struggle for a democracy as we want
it,'' but added: ``I am afraid I expect a period of chaos.''
   The head of the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada, Tyminski has
sometimes puzzled reporters with odd statements. He promised Poles
again on Monday he would quickly cure their economic woes.
   ``I want to make this country rich and prosperous,'' he said.
``It will be better within a month.''
   Tyminski has said a routine business trip to Warsaw in September
turned into a campaign for the presidency. He said he had been
denied entry to Poland in the 1980s.
   ``I just want to help my country, and I couldn't before,'' he
said.
   The new president will take over from Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
Communist general who ordered martial law to crush Solidarity but
now is retiring early to complete the democratic transformation.
   The election was the first in Eastern Europe tofocus not on
defeating communism but on choosing between visions for the
post-Communist future.
   The new president will serve a five-year term.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC said Monday it is putting Jane Pauley into
the Sunday night ratings wars opposite ABC's to-rated ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' and CBS' durable ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   The battles will start Jan. 6 at 8 p.m. EST when her ``Real Life
With Jane Pauley'' starts, followed by another NBC News series,
``Expose,'' an investigative program anchored by Tom Brokaw.
   Each will be a half-hour series for three Sundays a month, with
Pauley's show getting a full hour on the fourth Sunday and
Brokaw's``Expose'' getting that night off, NBC said.
   The two programs, the first NBC News series since the division's
low-rated ``1986'' newsmagazine, will take over the time slot
currently occupied by the medical series ``Lifestories,'' which
will appear monthly after Sunday's broadcast.
   NBC also said it is bringing back its ``Amen'' comedy series,
which had been axed from its fall lineup after four seasons, as a
midseason replacement beginning Saturday.
   ``The Fanelli Boys,'' a new situation comedy now on Wednesdays,
will move to Saturdays starting this week.``Working It Out,''
another new sitcom, will move from Saturday to Wednesday.
   Pauley's series began last summer as five one-hour specials. The
shows - and a new NBC contract - came after her controversial
replacement as ``Today'' anchorwoman by Deborah Norville.
   In becoming Sunday night regulars, Pauley and Brokaw will be
part of NBC's midseason bid to overcome the low ratings the network
has suffered during the first two hours of that evening.
   Last month, NBC axed its new ``Hull High'' series, which had led
off the network's Sunday night schedule against CBS' powerhouse
``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Life Goes On.''
   NBC has since has filled the ``Hull'' time period with specials
and movies, a spokesman said. A permanent replacement for ``Hull
High'' will be announced later.

   The U.S Air Force launched a new,
more powerful Delta rocket Monday carrying a $65 million Navstar
navigation satellite that will help troops stay oriented in the
Saudi Arabian desert.
   The loss of wind data from a weather balloon caused a brief
delay. But at 4:39 p.m., the $45 million, 128-foot Delta 2 -
boosted by an improved main engine and nine new, larger solid
rockets strapped around its first stage core - lifted off.
   The 10th Navstar satellite launched since February 1989
separated from its booster 25 minutes after launch. It is scheduled
to reach its final 11,000-mile orbit above Earth on Wednesday.
   The Navstars allow U.S. and allied troops inthe Middle East to
use telephone-sized, hand-held receivers to determine their
position within 35 feet in the nearly featureless desert of Saudi
Arabia. The troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   More than 1,000 receivers produced for civilian use have been
distributed to the troops in the Persian Gulf, said Lt. Gen. Thomas
Mooreman, Jr., chief of the Air Force Space Command. Another
thousand are on order.
   The Navstars also contain atomic clocks, the most accurate time
pieces in the world. They allow soldiers to synchronize their
watches and carry out split-second timed secret operations, the Air
Force said.
   Besides providing navigational and positioning data, the
3,675-pound satellites carry nuclear detection devices designed to
pinpoint the location of nuclear explosions.
   The new Navstar circling Earth is part of the $8.5 billion
Global Positioning System that eventually will have 24 satellites,
including three spares, in six orbital planes. The remaining
spacecraft in the series are to be launched by the end of 1992.

   China said Monday that Washington had invited a
Chinese vice minister of trade to visit next month. The report came
days before a major vote on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council, of
which China is a permanent member.
   A senior State Department official insisted the United States
had not changed its policy of barring high-level exchanges with
Beijing, a moratorium imposed after soldiers crushed the Chinese
democracy movement in June 1989.
   The official, speaking in Washington on condition of not being
identified, said the ban precludes ``large, formal ceremonial
exchanges,'' and that the visit of Vice Trade Minister Gu Yongjiang
does not fall into that category.
   He said meetings have been held since June 1989 at the vice
minister level, and next month's meeting is consistent with what
has gone on before.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, China and the Soviet Union on
Monday joined America, Britain and France in agreeing on a U.N.
draft resolution authorizing use of military force unless Iraq
withdraws by January from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.
Washington has pushed hard for such a resolution.
   Word of Gu's planned visit came as U.S. Embassy spokesman
Sheridan W. Bell announced that Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen will travel to New York to vote on that Security Council
resolution.
   Bell said the Beijing government notified the embassy of Qian's
plans. The Foreign Ministry here did not immediately respond when
asked for confirmation.
   As permanent council members, the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France each has veto power over any
resolution.
   China's longstanding policy is one of opposition to superpower
intervention in regional issues. China has pressed for a peaceful
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Beijing government's world standing has greatly improved
following China's support for resolutions against Iraq, prompting
efforts by the Bush administration to resume normal relations with
China.
   The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade said that
Vice Minister Gu will visit the United States from Dec. 10-14 at
the invitation of J. Michael Farren, Commerce Department
undersecretary.
   The only clear-cut Western sanction on China still in effect is
a ban on arms sales.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying U.S.-Mexican
relations ``have never been better,'' met with Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday for talks the White House said
focused on negotiating an end to trade barriers.
   ``Let's commence a new era for both our nations,'' Bush said,
addressing tens of thousands of people at an evening welcoming
ceremony in a plaza in this industrial city in northern Mexico.
Bush was here for two days of talks.
   ``Viva Mexico!'' Bush declared to cheers that filled the large
plaza.
   A prospective U.S.-Mexican free trade agreement, similar to one
the United States negotiated with Canada two years ago, headed the
agenda.
   But the president also cited ``challenges in the world beyond
our borders,'' particularly reconstruction in Central America ``and
restoration of stability in the Persian Gulf region.''
   Salinas has supported Bush's Persian Gulf policy and has hinted
he might send troops to fight along with U.S. forces if the United
Nations agrees to a U.S.-backed resolution authorizing force
against Iraq.
   Mexico has also increased its oil production to help offset oil
lost from Iraq and Kuwait, boosting its exports to the United
States by 100,000 barrels a day. There are 42 gallons in each
barrel.
   ``I've come to Mexico tonight with a message of respect... and
hope for a brighter future shared by our two countries,'' Bush
said. He called the ending of trade barriers vital to both nations.
   ``I believe that U.S.-Mexican relations have never been
better,'' Bush said in his first official visit as president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that, at their first
session, the two leaders focused on the proposed free trade
agreement.
   ``Both presidents are interested in pursuing the agreement as
fast as possible and attach high priority to its successful
conclusion,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Bush and Salinas also talked about increasing
cooperation in the war against drugs and working more closely to
end border violence.
   Bush and Salinas discussed the situation in El Salvador and
agreed ``to press for a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement to
the situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   Despite warm greetings the two presidents paid one another,
Salinas signalled difficult trade talks ahead, accusing the United
States of trade protectionism even before his guest arrived.
   ``Today, American products can enter the Mexican market without
restriction,'' he told the Monterrey daily El Norte. ``But ours are
detained at customs, and there are always many restrictions.''
   Bush got a red-carpet airport greeting, then travelled with
Salinas by helicopter to Salinas' hometown of Agualeguas, a small
farming and cattle community about 60 miles northeast of Monterrey.
   Salinas took Bush to a charro, or rodeo, where the two
presidents were tieless while their wives wore light suits under a
glaring sun.
   They watched Mexican dancers before walking through the packed
streets of the town square to a luncheon and talks.
   It was the sixth time Bush and Salinas have met since they were
both elected in 1988, but Bush's first trip to Mexico as president.
   Salinas, introducing Bush at the rally, hailed what he said was
``a new relationship between our countries'' as Mexico assumes its
``new place in the world.''
   ``Geography made us forced neighbors, history made us wary
neighbors, may our will and vision of the future make us respectful
and progressive neighbors,''Salinas said.
   ``Mexico has changed, faithful to its principles and traditions
but looking to the future with liberty and sovereignty to become a
modern, competitive and just nation,'' said Salinas.
   On Tuesday, the two were to meet for more talks and Bush was to
address a group of Mexican business leaders in Monterrey, a
manufacturing city of more than 3 million only 143 miles from
Laredo, in Texas, Bush's adopted homestate.
   Preliminary discussions on the free-trade pact have been under
way since Salinas visited Washington in June. Bush notified
Congress in September of his plans to negotiate such an agreement,
possibly by 1992.
   But even as the United States and Mexico worked toward achieving
such an accord, trade frictions remained.
   Salinas has resisted Bush administration suggestions that the
state-run oil industry be opened up to U.S. investment as part of
the free-trade negotiations.
   Mexico also wants any free trade agreement to make it easer for
Mexicans to enter the United States.
   In the newspaper interview, Salinas said he was concerned that
protectionist attitudes in the United States were making it hard
for Mexico to ship agricultural products and fish.
   Mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the
United States for not meeting quality standards, restrictions that
Mexicans contend favor U.S. growers and fishing interests.
   A recent U.S. ban on Mexican tuna, which environmentalists said
was caught in nets that kill dolphins, caused an outcry here. The
ban has since been overturned by a federal court.

   Defending champion Garry Kasparov and his
fellow Soviet rival Anatoly Karpov adjourned their 14th game of the
World Chess Championship on Monday after both players encountered
time troubles following five hours of play.
   The rapid-fire finish ended when Kasparov sealed his 41st move.
Both had three pawns, a rook, a queen and king left.
   They also adjourned after Saturday's 13th game, which led to a
draw. Kasparov and Karpov each have 6{ points.
   They were tied at 6 after the first 12 games in New York, 10 of
which were draws, between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7.
   The first player to gain 12{ points wins the championship and
$1.7 million of a $3 million purse. In event of a tie, Kasparov
retains the title.
   Monday's 14th game, and second of the French phase of the
championship, started when Kasparov walked on stage and sat behind
the white pieces. He thought a few minutes and moved the king's
pawn.
   Karpov arrived and matched it by moving his king's pawn.
   Kasparov used an opening that Karpov has seen before in
top-level competition known as the Scotch game.
   Until the eighth move, the game matched two contests that Karpov
played with black against Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman in the
mid-1980s.
   Karpov won one game in 28 moves and drew the other after 57, so
experts noted that he was acquainted with this line of play.
   He played black at least seven times in major competition
against the Scotch opening, winning three and drawing four.
   But when Kasparov moved a queen's bishop's pawn, a new game
developed.
   After almost two hours and 17 moves of the game, Karpov already
had an hour more in playing time than Kasparov.
   Karpov used almost 20 minutes to decide his 18th move, moving
his queen in a position to apply some central pressure.
   By now, Karpov had less than 48 minutes to do 22 moves. Each
player is allotted 2{ hours for his first 40 moves.
   Saturday, in the 13th game, Karpov also ran into time trouble
but got out of it with eight moves in seven minutes.
   But on Monday, Kasparov wasted away his time advantage on the
19th move. He thought for 53 minutes before he decided to move the
queen's knight.
   On the 21st move, Karpov brought up a knight to add more
pressure and grandmasters were saying that Karpov could be
threatening mate quite soon.
   But Kasparov battled back after being in check on the 23rd move.
   After a flurry of exchanges, Karpov had just five minutes left
for 14 moves but moved quickly to use just three minutes for six
moves.
   But Kasparov was under pressure, too, and realized he had just
eight minutes left after move 32.
   From then on, both players made moves in a series of rapid
decisions that left them both flirting with the time limit after
five hours.
   Karpov put Kasparov into check three consecutive times but
Kasparov kept moving his king out of danger.
   The two played almost exactly the five-hour limit for the first
40 moves before Kasparov sealed his 41st move.
   Experts again were divided on who had the better posiion.
Another draw could be agreed upon before play resumes Tuesday.
   After Saturday's adjournment, Karpov offered a draw Sunday
morning, six hours before the restart.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie came out of hiding briefly Monday
to tape a television interview in which the author said he wants to
put together ``bits of my life'' and talk to Moslems about threats
on his life, the BBC reported.
   Rushdie has been in seclusion since February 1989 when the late
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill
him for blaspheming Islam in his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie went to the BBC's Lime Grove studios in West London for
an interview on the arts program ``The Late Show,'' which was
broadcast Monday night, the BBC said.
   The BBC refused comment on why Rushdie decided to go to the
studio instead of being interviewed at a ``safe'' house as he has
in the past.
   ``I want to slowly begin to pinch back bits of my life and to
continue to work as hard as I can to bring the temperature down,''
he said.
   ``That involves talking to Moslem leaders to try and find a
common ground and it seems to me there is a lot of common ground
but the point is to make it more solid.''
   He again denied that ``The Satanic Verses'' was an incitement to
religious hatred.
   Asked what he would like to be doing in a few months, Rushdie
said, ``I would like to spend it on a beach, but I can't see it
happening. I am not looking too far ahead.''

<TEXT>
   Patience, and a quarter of the water Denver uses
in one day, helped firefighters rein in a fire Monday that burned
more than 1.9 million gallons of jet fuel at a tank farm near
Stapleton International Airport.
   The strategy of the 150 firefighters was to let the fire that
began Sunda consume fuel in the ignited tanks and prevent it from
spreading by drenching nearby tanks with water and foam.
   ``We, at this point in time, feel like everything is under our
grasp,'' said Denver Fire Department Capt. Nick Nuanes. ``Things
are going real, real good. The intensity has dropped
dramatically.''
   Meanwhile, the black smoke from the fire that darkened the sky
and caused potential health problems was tracked with help from a
crew of computer scientists at Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   The fire at the Ogden Allied Services Corp. tank farm began when
a valve on a 400,000-gallon storage tank broke and jet fuel began
to leak. The flames eventually spread to three other tanks.
   The facility has 12 storage tanks with a capacity of 12.5
million gallons of fuel. They include the primary fuel source for
United Airlines, which was forced on Sunday to delay and cancel an
undetermined number of its 186 flights into and out of Denver.
   But the carrier was nearly back on schedule Monday after finding
alternate fuel sources, said Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman in
Chicago.
   The fire caused few problems for other airlines at Stapleton
because most had alternate sources of fuel on hand. Stapleton is
the nation's fourth-busiest airport in passenger volume.
   By midday Monday firefighters had used 15,000 gallons of foam.
About 24 million gallons of water had been poured on the blaze,
about one-fourth the water used in the city system on an average
fall day.
   Temperatures near the fire reached 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit,
well beyond the melting point of iron.
   By Monday, the fire that consumed fuel in two 400,000 gallon
capacity tanks left them blackened, crumpled masses of metal.
   But flames continued to burn in one tank containing about
350,000 gallons of fuel and in an 800,000-gallon tank. Officials
said the latter held enough fuel to burn until about midday
Wednesday.
   Authorities decided to let the fuel burn, rather than attempt to
smother the fire and face potential ground contamination, Nuanes
said.
   ``We'd like to see the fuel burn itself off,'' he said. ``We're
not going to attempt to extinguish the fire. We don't want a
contamination problem on our hands.''
   Rocky Flats scientists helped Colorado health officials by using
a computer model to forecast the path of the fire's smoke.
   The plume of black, billowing smoke twisted in several
directions across Denver as a storm front traveled through the
city, but was headed southwest late in the day, said Reed Hodgin,
manager of emergency assessments for EG&amp;G Inc., which operates the
weapons plant north of Denver.
   ``The (computer) model has been very accurate as far as what
we've seen the plume do,'' said Steve Arnold, manager of the
technical services program at the Colorado Department of Health.
   The Rocky Flats team helped state health officials determine
whether the plume will affect the population and which it might
affect most, Arnold said.

   More than 100 Americans, Britons and other
Europeans held at strategic sites in Kuwait have been moved to
Baghdad, diplomats reported Monday.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, said three American
hostages can go home, and the Swedish Embassy announced more than
50 Swedes in Iraq have also been given permission to leave.
   U.S. and British diplomats said the Western hostages in Kuwait -
including five Americans and 70 Britons - were brought to the
Mansour Melia Hotel in the Iraqi capital.
   The diplomats, however, were unsure if the Westerners would
replace Germans allowed to leave strategic sites inside Iraq or
were brought to Baghdad to be released.
   They also said that Iraq has not allowed any Iraqis to enter
Kuwait for a week and has been encouraging those in the country to
go home.
   Britons are largest group of Westerners in the two countries,
with about 400 hiding in Kuwait, another 400 not allowed to leave
Iraq but free to move within Baghdad and 330 hostages, the British
Embassy said.
   The U.S. Embassy has said there are more than 900 Americans in
the two countries, including 104 held at strategic sites.
   A broadcast on Iraqi television Monday included footage of
Saddam meeting with a group of Americans and their relatives, who
were told they would be allowed to leave together.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said three American hostages will
be allowed to leave.
   Some U.S. government officials have criticized relatives' trips
to Iraq, and said the broadcast was a propaganda exercise by
Saddam.
   ``If you feel that hospitality has come to an end, you can
travel to the United States of America, or anywhere else in the
world at any time you deem appropriate,'' the report quoted Saddam
as saying.
   Those in the meeting shown on TV were Fred Harrington, 59, of
Bellevue, Wash., whose son, Vala Fouroohi, has been seeking his
release; and Bill Stevenson and James Stevenson of Panama City,
Fla., and their sister Mary Trundy of Brockton, Mass., who sought
the release of their brother, John, 44, a computer specialist who
worked in Kuwait for 11 years.
   ``I believe I'm coming home,'' Harrington said in a telephone
call to his wife, Najmi, at their home in Bellevue. He did not to
give her details on when he or other hostages could be freed.
   Harrington, founder and president of the Redmond, Wash.-based
American Pulp and Paper Co., is a native of Iran. He changed his
name after emigrating to the United States. He became a U.S.
citizen in 1986.
   The daughter-in-law of hostage Clyde Jesse, 55, a U.S. citizen
who was living in Kuwait, said Monday that Jesse has also been
promised he can leave Iraq.
   Kim Nickel of Yuma, Ariz., said her mother, Honey Jesse, 54,
appeared before the Iraqi parliament last week and pleaded for
Jesse's release. Ms. Nickel said Jesse and his wife were at a
Baghdad hotel Monday.
   The Swedish Embassy announced a group of Swedish
parliamentarians and peace activists secured the release of 56
Swedes as well as a non-Swedish dependent and a citizen of Iceland.
   According to the embassy, the National Assembly, or parliament,
decided to release the Swedes after the Swedish group met with
Iraqi officials.
   The embassy said no date has been fixed for the hostages'
departure, and a diplomat said the parliament action would have to
be ratified by Saddam.
   Also in Parliament on Monday, a letter from Swedish Prime
Minister Ingvar Carlsson was read condemning Israeli policy in the
region and pointing out that Kuwait was not the only country
occupied in the region, a reference to Palestinian lands controlled
by Israel. He also said Sweden would not back a military settlement
to the crisis.
   Two Finnish delegation members were also meeting with Iraqi
officials in an effort to win the release of nine Finns in Iraq.
   But Iraqi Deputy Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan criticized a recent
Finnish statement implying the nation would approve a U.N.
resolution backing the use of force in the gulf, Finnish radio
reported.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners beginning Dec. 25 in
exchange for U.S. guarantees he will not be attacked. The release
period from Dec. 25 to March 25 coincides with the time considered
best to launch a military operation since temperatures are lower
and there are frequent stretches of calm weather.
   Western governments and others have said they will not negotiate
releases because they believe Saddam is trying to divide the
anti-Iraq coalition.
   He has freed several hundred people, mainly Europeans, after
mercy missions to Baghdad by former prime ministers and other
non-government figuers.
   In Milan, Italy, an Italian who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage
while held in Iraq arrived Monday and was placed in a hospital.
   A medical plane of the Europe Assistance group flew Maurizio
Rossetti, 53, from Baghdad, where he had been hospitalized, the
Italian news agency AGI reported.
   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze sought
clarification on why only 350 of a promised 1,000 Soviet citizens
had been allowed to leave this month.

   A man convicted of sexually assaulting a
woman with 46 personalities requested a new trial Monday because
prosecutors failed to disclose the woman was having a sexual
relationship with a key witness.
   Mark A. Peterson, 29, was convicted Nov. 8 of second-degree
sexual assault and faces a 10-year prison sentence. Prosecutors
argued he manipulated the woman's mental illness, called multiple
personality disorder, to have sex with her.
   Wisconsin law forbids sexual contact with mentally ill people
who cannot understand the consequences of their action.
   Peterson filed an appeal in Winnebago County Circuit Court,
citing information disclosed last week by a former counselor to the
woman. The counselor was fired for trying to profit from book and
movie contracts about the case.
   The counselor disclosed to the court the woman has had a sexual
relationship for a year with a neighbor who was a key prosecution
witness against Peterson. The woman admitted to the relationship.

   A judge Monday set bond at $100,000 for
the man accused of helping convicted murderer Lawrencia Bembenek -
popularly known as ``Bambi'' - escape from prison and flee to
Canada in July.
   Dominic Gugliatto, a 35-year-old suburban Milwaukee factory
worker, was returned to Wisconsin last week, about a month after he
and Ms. Bembenek were captured in Thunder Bay, Ontario.
   He is charged with aiding and abetting Ms. Bembenek's escape, a
felony carrying up to five years in prison.
   Fond du Lac County Circuit Judge Henry Buslee said he ordered a
large bond because authorities may question Gugliatto about other
crimes, including a homicide.
   The judge and District Attorney Peter Grimm would not explain
further.
   Ms. Bembenek, 32, a former Playboy club waitress and
policewoman, was serving a life prison sentence for the 1981 murder
of her then-husband's ex-wife when she escaped July 15 from
Taycheedah Correctional Institute near Fond du Lac.
   Ms. Bembenek and Gugliatto were captured in October after a
visitor to Thunder Bay recognized them from a recent segment of the
television show ``America's Most Wanted.''

   The five permanent members of the Security Council agreed Monday
on a U.N. draft resolution authorizing military force against Iraq
by January unless it quits Kuwait. Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Iraq
its aggression will be punished.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said on Monday a ``great number''
of Iraqis were dying because U.N. sanctions were depriving them of
medicine, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Diplomatic sources discounted previous Iraqi claims it was short
of medicine. Medical shipments qualify as humanitarian aid, not
barred under the U.N. trade embargo imposed to make Iraq leave
Kuwait after its blitz invasion on Aug. 2 following disputes over
oil, land and money.
   The draft agreed Monday by the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France would be the 11th U.N. resolution aimed
at Iraq since the Persian Gulf crisis began. It would authorize
``all necesary means'' - meaning military force - unless Iraq
withdraws by Jan. 1 or Jan. 15.
   A firm date will be decided before the 15-member council votes
this week, diplomats said. The measure is expected to be adopted at
an extraordinary council session of foreign ministers.
   As Soviet President Gorbachev pledged in an address to the
Supreme Soviet parliament that the alliance against Iraq would not
be broken, the Bush administration called up combat reserve troops
from four states.
   Oil prices jumped $2 a barrel amid speculation about war in the
gulf.
   Saddam blamed the United States for the alleged shortage of
medicine in his remarks to the relatives of three American hostages
released in Iraq on Monday, INA said, monitored in Cyprus.
   Saddam said no foreigners had died as a result of not being
allowed to leave Iraq, the report said.
   Iraq has held hundreds of Americans trapped by the Kuwait
invasion, among other foreign hostages. He said Monday that in
holding them, ``we only intended to add factors that might make
some of those who seek war hesitate a little to think better.''
   President Bush and other leaders have said the hostages will not
be a factor in deciding whether to attack Iraq, and called for
their immediate release.
   Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met
with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in the Kremlin to demand
that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait.
   Answering questions from legislators in Moscow, Gorbachev said
the gulf crisis was a test of the new post-Cold War cooperation.
   ``Our position remains based on principles and it includes the
following: Aggression is inadmissible. It should be punished, and
the pre-aggression state should be restored,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said Saddam could not break the alliance assembled against
Iraq and that Iraq's aggression could not be allowed to prevail
``because we are just moving away from the Cold War, when
everything was decided from a position of force.''
   In the Iraqi capital, U.S. and British diplomats said more than
100 Americans, Britons and Europeans held in Kuwait were brought
overnight to a Baghdad hotel. The group included at least 10
Americans and 60 Britons.
   The diplomats said they were unsure if the new arrivals would be
used to replace Germans allowed to leave strategic sites in Iraq or
were being brought to Baghdad to be released.
   They also said Iraq had not allowed any Iraqis to enter Kuwait
for a week and had been urging those in the country to go home.
   The Swedish Embassy said nearly 60 Swedes, the last remaining
Swedish citizens in Iraq, will be allowed to leave.
   However, the Soviet Union complained Iraq reneged on a promise
to free 1,000 more Soviet citizens this month.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Iraq's actions
were ``totally abnormal and unacceptable.'' The official Soviet
news agency Tass said Aziz attributed the Soviets' delayed
departures to a ``bureaucratic accident.''
   Dennis Trundy of Brockton, Mass., said Saddam told his wife in
Saddam's meeting Monday with relatives of hostages that her twin
brother, John Stevenson, would soon be allowed to go.
   ``She and her two brothers met with Saddam Hussein sometime this
morning and he said `sure, take him,''' said Trundy, who spoke with
his wife by telephone.
   Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash., also apparently was among
those promised freedom. ``I believe I'm coming home,'' Harrington
said in a telephone call to his wife, Najmi, at the family's
Bellevue home.
   The family of Clyde Jesse, an American living in Kuwait, said
Jesse was also to be freed.
   In other developments:
   -Six hundred Kuwaiti volunteers completed six weeks of basic
training in Saudi Arabia. Some will join the regular Kuwaiti army
serving near the border with their homeland, while others will
serve in support positions. Some 3,000 to 5,000 Kuwaiti troops are
part of the multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   -An Indian cargo ship will unload its remaining 4,700 tons of
rice for foreigners trapped in Iraq, Indian reports said. Iraq had
refused to let the cargo ship leave the port of Umm Qasr with the
rice. The ship arrived in Iraq in early September with food and
supplies for Indians in Iraq and Kuwait.

   The Soviet Union and China joined the
United States, Britain and France on Monday in delivering an
ultimatum that gives Iraq until January to withdraw its troops from
Kuwait or face a military strike.
   The nations - the five permanent Security Council members with
veto power - agreed Monday on a draft resolution that allows use of
``all necessary means'' to liberate Kuwait and restore its
government.
   The draft contains optional deadline dates - Jan. 1 or Jan. 15.
It gives Iraq one last chance in ``a pause of goodwill.''
   The deadline in the final resolution, to be adopted Thursday,
will be decided in consultations among the 15 council members,
diplomats said.
   Monday's accord ends speculation the Soviets and Chinese might
abstain. Previously, the Kremlin and Beijing indicated only they
would not veto the measure. Now a positive vote by the Soviet Union
and China seems assured on the proposed resolution.
   All five permament members voted on the 10 earlier resolutions
passed against Iraq.
   The broad coalition against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait now has
passed its toughest test - authorization of military force.
   The resolution demands that Iraq withdraw and authorizes ``all
necessary means'' - meaning military force - to drive Iraqi
invaders from Kuwait. But it decides ``to allow Iraq one final
opportunity, as a pause of goodwill,'' to leave the sheikdom it
invaded Aug. 2.
   The measure is expected to be adopted at an extraordinary
session of foreign ministers. It would mark the second time in U.N.
history the Security Council authorized military action to counter
aggression. The first was in 1950 during the Korean conflict.
   The council also authorized military action to enforce the
maritime embargo of Iraq and the blockade against Rhodesia - now
black-ruled Zimbabwe - in 1966.
   British Ambassador David Hannay told reporters the January
deadline, whether the first or 15th ``is not a pause for good
offices.''
   ``It is a pause in which we all are making clear that no new
measures will be taken against Iraq prior to the end of that
period, after which the authorization to use all measures ... which
includes the use of force, would become available,'' he said.
   The envoy said Britain supports a Jan. 1 deadline because that
would mean ``nearly six months that Iraq has been in illegal
occupation of Kuwait and long enough to realize the world is united
against it.''
   The United states also favors Jan. 1, but U.S. officials in
Washington indicated the resolution and date were negotiable.
   Kuwait was preparing a presentation for the Security Council on
Tuesday - including a videotape - to portray what it describes as
Iraqi atrocities since the invasion, including the murder of
children and looting of hospitals.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuliy M. Vorontsov told reporters Monday as he
entered consultations ``there is broad agreement'' among the five.
He did not specify the deadline for Iraqi troop withdrawal, but
Western and other diplomats said the Soviets favor more time for
peace efforts.
   The draft resolution would authorize ``member states cooperating
with the government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before Jan. 1 (15)
1991, fully implements the foregoing resolutions (calling for
withdrawal), to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the
Security Council resolutions passed in response to Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait, and to restore international peace and
security.'
   The resolution text, obtained by The Associated Press, says that
despite all U.N. efforts ``Iraq refuses to comply with its
obligation'' to heed U.N. resolutions demanding withdrawal from
Kuwait ``in flagrant contempt of the council.''
   It cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes use of
military force to counter aggression, if sanctions and other steps
fail.
   Foreign diplomats said they expect the proposal to be amended
before the vote this week, noting some member states are against
imposing a deadline for withdrawal of Saddam Hussein's troops from
Kuwait.
   Judith Kipper, an associate at Brookings Institute, a Washington
research group, said it would be a mistake for the Bush
administration to try to set a deadline.
   Ms. Kipper, who just returned from Baghdad where she met the
Iraqi president, said: ``To put a date is to put his back to the
wall and make things impossible. If we go public, it's a guarantee
that we'll have to go to war.''
   The United States has the nine votes needed to ensure passage,
and the vote is likely Thursday or Friday. Any permanent member
could block the resolution, but a veto is considered unlikely.
   The United States consulted with the other four permanent
members Monday in an attempt to agree on final wording of the
resolution. Informal talks also were held with the other council
members.
   U.S. officials want to secure a resolution on use of force
before turning the December presidency over to Yemen, which has
favored Iraq in the past.
   Other Security Council members at present are Canada, Colombia,
Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and
Zaire.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
Monday that many Iraqis were dying because United Nations sanctions
were depriving them of medicine, the official Iraqi news agency
reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted him Monday as telling
relatives of three American hostages about to be freed that the
United States - in the forefront of the effort to push Iraq out of
Kuwait - was responsible for the deaths.
   ``But do you know, ladies and gentlemen, how many children and
people died as a result of the United States denying medicine to
the people of Iraq?'' INA quoted him as saying.
   ``Go to the hospitals and ask them to supply us with lists, we
will find out what great number of people are dying as a result of
being deprived of medicine.''
   Diplomatic sources have discounted previous Iraqi claims it was
short of medicine. Foreign hospital staff leaving Iraq have not
reported any gaps in drugs, although they said Iraq lacked medical
personnel in some specialized fields like pediatrics.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that
tons of medicine have been flown in weekly from European nations
seeking hostage releases. The latest large shipment was 25 tons
from Italy on Saturday. Medical shipments qualify as humanitarian
aid, not barred under the U.N. trade embargo.
   Kuwaiti officials have said they had a six-month stockpile of
medicine for almost 2 million people in Kuwait that Iraq seized
after its Aug. 2 invasion.
   The diplomatic sources said Iraq was claiming a shortage of
medicine to stockpile supplies for the military in case the Persian
Gulf confrontation erupts.
   Saddam said no foreigners died as a result of not being allowed
to leave Iraq, INA reported.
   He told the American families that Iraqis were also unhappy that
hundreds of foreigners were barred from leaving.
   ``But our only excuse lies in the intention, we do not intend to
harm anybody or deny anybody his rights,'' he said.
   ``We only intended to add factors that might make some of those
who seek war hesitate a little to think better.''
   President Bush and other leaders have said the hostages will not
be a factor in deciding whether to attack Iraq, and called for the
immediate release of all hostages.
   Saddam repeated his call for peace by alluding to Iraq's 1980-88
war with Iran.
   ``We know very well what war means because we have been through
it. We also know that should this war take place, it will be very
horrifying, both for humanity in general and for the interests of
mankind,'' he said.

<HEAD>Second Mistrial Frees Man Accused of Shooting Ex-Wife, Killer Her
Lover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EXETER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose ex-wife awoke from months in a
coma and accused him of shooting her and killing her boyfriend
walked free Monday after the second mistrial in his case.
   George Gurney won his freedom when a lone juror's dissent led to
a mistrial. It was the second hung jury in five months.
   The Rockingham County Superior Court jury had deliberated 14
hours since early last week before telling Judge Douglas Gray they
were deadlocked with 11 votes to convict and one to acquit,
Assistant Attorney General Michael Ramsdell said.
   Prosecutors had decided not to seek a third trial if the jury
couldn't reach a verdict.
   Miriam Stoltz-Gurney, 48, was found in woods near her Windham
home in February 1989, shot in the head and left for dead.
   Nearly five months passed before she regained consciousness. But
when she did come around, Stoltz-Gurney identified her ex-husband
as her assailant.
   Neither the jurors nor Gurney, 54, would speak to reporters.
   Defense lawyer Albert Scherr said Gurney was relieved and felt
good.
   Gurney of Newburyport, Mass., was a newspaper advertising
salesman when he was arrested last year. He had been behind bars
ever since.
   Stoltz-Gurney told authorities that she and her boyfriend, Roger
Whittemore, were surprised the night of the assault by a man
wearing camouflage fatigues who burst into her home and beat,
stabbed and shot Whittemore.
   Whittemore, 52, was found dead at the scene.
   Gurney was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder
and kidnapping.
   Stoltz-Gurney is now in a rehabilitation center in Boston.
   Last June, a mistrial was declared in Gurney's first trial after
jurors deliberated 19 hours and failed to reach a verdict. Half
voted to convict him, half to acquit him.
   The testimony by Stoltz-Gurney was all the prosecution had to
put Gurney at the scene.
   The defense hammered at the reliability of her memory, calling
experts who testified that people with her kind of head injury
sometimes create memories to fill in gaps in their actual recall.

<TEXT>
   President Najibullah of Afghanistan
said Monday he has received proposals from the exiled king and
Moslem rebels that could help end the 12-year-old civil war.
   Najibullah said the proposals from former King Zahir Shah and
the mujahedeen guerrillas were made last week during his four-day
trip to Geneva. He did not give details of the plans.
   ``We talked with a number of opposition leaders and exchanged
views for a political settlement,'' the 43-year-old president told
a news conference in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   His remarks were broadcast later by state Kabul Radio on a
program directed toward the more than 5 million Afghan refugees
living in neighboring Iran and Pakistan.
   ``I can say that I am pleased and satisfied with the results of
that meeting. It could be the real foundation for future
meetings,'' he said.
   The Afghan president also said he stopped briefly in Mashad,
Iran, en route to Geneva for talks with government officials. About
nine guerrilla groups are headquartered in Iran.
   Najibullah and his government have repeatedly claimed to have
had contacts with the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, over
the past two years. However, they have refused to disclose the
names.
   Najibullah again on Monday refused to give details of the
meetings, saying it could damage the peace process.
   But guerrilla leaders based in Pakistan have accused the Kabul
government of concocting stories about peace talks to try to
undermine and further divide the resistance.
   One guerrilla leader also accused the fundamentalist guerrillas
of launching a smear campaign to link the more moderate leaders who
favor the return of the former king with Najibullah. The
fundamentalist have threatended to kill the former king if he
returns from exile in Rome.
   At least two Pakistani English-language newspapers carried
front-page stories Monday, claiming the two most moderate guerrilla
leaders had met this month with Najibullah.
   The Muslim and The Frontier Post said Pir Sayed Ahmed Gailani,
leader of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, met Najibullah
in Geneva and that Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, leader of one of the
smallest guerrilla groups, met the Afghan president earlier in
Iran.
   Both newspapers based their reports on Afghan News Agency, run
by fundamentalist leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and often criticized
for its highly exaggerated reports and erroneous information.
   NIFA spokesman Azim Nasser-Zia denied reports. ``It was
physically nt possible,'' he said.
   For more than 12 years, the guerrillas headquartered in Pakistan
have been fighting to topple successive Communist governments in
Afghanistan.
   After the Soviet army intervened in Afghanistan in 1979,
Washington sent billions of dollars to the resistance.
   Pakistan has served as the conduit for U.S.-supplied weapons,
but Western diplomats said Washington has little control over the
allocation of arms. It is widely known that Hekmatyar's
Hezb-i-Islami, or Party of Islam, receives the lions' share of
weapons even though it is the most anti-Western of the seven
guerrilla groups.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nguyen Van Tam, prime minister to former Vietnamese
emperor Bao Dai, has died, his family said Monday. He was 97.
   Nguyen died Friday, family members said. Cause of death was not
given for Nguyen, who had lived in exile here the last 35 years.
   Nguyen was president of the Vietnamese Council from 1952-53
after holding several ministerial posts from 1946.
   He was nicknamed the Tiger of Cai Lay for eliminating communist
Vietnamese resistance groups in the Cai Lay region of the Mekong
Delta.
   Named chief of criminal investigations in Saigon in 1950, he put
an end to a series of assassination attempts by the communist
resistance.
   Nguyen had French nationality since 1927 and was awarded several
decorations by the French government including commander of the
Legion of Honor.
   Details on surviving family members were not available.

   Decades of stubbornness paid off - at
least temporarily - for Doris Gagnon Monday when the state
abandoned its effort to evict the 73-year-old squatter from her
makeshift beachfront home.
   The state had until Friday to evict Gagnon from her compound of
shacks and trailers in Milford on Long Island Sound so it could
proceed with plans laid 19 years ago to build a park.
   Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle said she wouldn't enforce
the order because the the state Department of Environmental
Protection decided it didn't immediately need Gagnon's land.
   For two decades Gagnon refused to sell her house and half acre
and stood fast when the state marshaled its legal forces against
her.
   On Monday, Gagnon was as steadfast as ever. She said she'll
never give up her sandy plot bordered on three sides by tall marsh
grass. Nevermind that she has no electricity, running water or
telephone - this is home, with a family of cats, dogs, chickens,
geese and ducks.
   ``They met somebody that wasn't afraid of them,'' she said,
standing outside the combination chain-link and chicken-wire fence
that surrounds her property.
   ``For 39 years I give it right back,'' she said. ``Thank God.
With God's help I've been able to take it and I'll take it until
this case is over. I won't give them the satisfaction of dying.''
   Gagnon's battle with the state began in the mid-1960s, when
about 100 cottages in her neighborhood were torn down to make way
for a state park.
   She refused to sell. The state seized her house and land under
the right of eminent domain and her house was demolished in 1971.
Gagnon was to get $15,000 for her land. She refused to take the
money.
   Instead, Gagnon stayed as a squatter. The state sought an
eviction order in 1988, after Milford health officials expressed
concern about squalid conditions including bags of human waste
piled behind her living quarters.
   In her battle with the state, Gagnon argued she was never fairly
compensated for her property, and that she should receive an amount
equal to its current market worth.
   Riddle also said she had been assured by Milford health
officials that sanitary problems cited in the original court action
had improved.
   ``There are times when circumstances change,'' Riddle said. ``We
are dealing with changed circumstances here.''
   Riddle said the decision doesn't mean Gagnon can stay
indefinitely. Eviction efforts could resume in two to three years,
when the land is more likely to be needed, she said.
   ``This is only a postponement,'' Riddle said. ``If it becomes
necessary because the state needs the land, the state will be
prepared to go forward with evicting her.''

<HEAD>Government Troops Flee Camp Under Rebel Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebel fighters are hunting down
government soldiers who fled a beseiged military camp into the
swampy jungles in northern Sri Lanka, a guerrlla leader said
Monday.
   The government statement said 150 soldiers were missing and more
than 100 of them were feared dead. It also claimed 196 rebels were
killed in the clash before government troops retreated Saturday.
   The rebel militia said its fighters found 158 bodies of soldiers
in the camp, and 30 guerrillas were killed.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed. Both sides are
known to make exaggerated claims.
   Military officials said the troops made a ``tactical
withdrawal'' after Tamil forces stormed a military encampment in
Mankulam, about 160 miles northeast of Colombo.
   ``We regard the capture of Mankulam camp as a great victory,'' a
rebel leader, Sathasivam Krishnakumar, said in a telephone
interview from London.
   The fall of the camp is one of the worst setbacks suffered by
the government since rebels resumed their separatist campaign in
June this year.
   In September, the Tiger rebels killed 60 soldiers when they
overran the Kokavil army camp, 10 miles north of Mankulam.
   Krishnakumar said at least 250 soldiers have fled into the
jungles.
   ``They have split into small groups or individuals and are lost.
Our cadres are hunting them down,'' he said.
   The nearest military garrison is Vavuniya, 30 miles south of
Mankulam. ``The troops will never make it there,'' Krishnakumar
said.
   The Tamil guerrillas seek an independent nation, claiming they
are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority in jobs and
education.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed since Tamils started
the separatist campaign in 1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population,
control the government and military.
   With the fall of Mankulam, the government now controls only five
isolated military bases in the predominantly rebel-controlled
north.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa called an emergency government
meeting Monday to discuss the Mankulam attack, senior government
officials said. Details of the meeting were not disclosed.

   Cuba's communist regime has replaced Vice
President Jose Ramon Fernandez as education minister with educator
Luis Ignacio Gomez Gutierrez, the Mexican official news agency
Notimex reported Monday.
   Fernandez, whose formal title is Vice President of the Council
of Ministers, has held both jobs for more than two decades, and the
decision to replace him in the education slot was taken by the
Political Bureau of the Cuban Communist Party, Notimex said.
   A Notimex dispatch from Havana quoted in a party news release as
saying this was the third change in the council this month, but
gave no reason for Fernandez's replacement.
   Gomez Gutierrez was rector of Central University at Las Villas
Province.
   The dispatch from the Cuban capital, monitored here, said
Fernandez will continue to serve as president of the Organizing
Committee of the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana.

<HEAD>Energy Officials Back Off Restart Date for Savannah River Site
Reactors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just weeks before the scheduled restart of
the first Savannah River Site reactor, the Energy Department said
Monday it doesn't know when the plant's three reactors will begin
operations.
   A top agency official Monday also said the Energy Department
might not need to restart all three reactors to continue meeting
the nation's needs for nuclear weapons materials.
   Deputy Secretary Henson Moore said the Savannah River reactors
aren't ready to be restarted because they still fail to meet Energy
Department standards.
   In an interview with The Augusta Chronicle, Moore refused to be
specific about when the reactors might be restarted. Moore was in
the Augusta area Monday to present a grant to the South Carolina
Universities Research and Education Foundation.
   The reactors, located in South Carolina about 30 minutes east of
Augusta, are the nation's sole production source of plutonium and
tritium, two key elements in nuclear weapons. Tritium, a
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear
weapons, decays at the rate of about 5.5 percent a year and must be
replenished in warheads periodically.
   All three reactors have been shut down since August 1988 for
safety improvements. In May, Energy Secretary James Watkins said
the first reactor would be restarted in December or January, and
the other two reactors would restart by six months later.
   Nuclear experts, including Watkins, previously have said that a
delay in the timetable could result in a dismantling of some
nuclear weapons because enough of the tritium in them would have
decayed to render them useless.
   But Moore said Monday such time pressure no longer exists.
   ``The Soviet Union is changing, and the pressure on us to have a
certain amount of nuclear materials by a certain date is changing
to where we are not under any bind in the foreseeable future,''
Moore said.
   Moore said the previously scheduled restart dates were simply an
estimate by the department made at Congress' request. He said the
department never intended to restart the reactors until they met
department standards.
   ``Our schedule has always been that when they're ready, they
will operate. Our standards still haven't been met, and so
therefore, those reactors aren't going to run,'' Moore said.

   Leftist rebels shot down an air
force helicopter in eastern El Salvador on Monday, three days after
downing a jet fighter.
   The armed forces said the pilot and co-pilot sustained minor
injuries when the UH-1M crash-landed after being hit by guerrilla
ground fire. The rocket-equipped helicopter went down near
Jiquilisco, 50 miles east of San Salvador.
   Air force mechanics were on the scene at midday, salvaging the
turbine engine of the U.S.-supplied copter as well as munitions and
avionics. The fuselage and rotors of the U.S.-made helicopter were
damaged beyond repair, and officers on the scene said the stripped
hulk would be left where it crashed.
   The helicopter was hit by ground fire while providing air
support to government forces battling guerrillas along the coastal
highway.
   The rebels downed an A-37 Dragonfly jet fighter last week with a
surface-to-air missile. It was their first successful use of the
missiles in the 11-year-old civil war.
   In other fighting Monday, commandos from the rebel Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front ambushed an army infantry patrol in
the western sector of the capital. The armed forces press office
said six soldiers were wounded.
   It also said the FMLN bombed five bank offices during the night
in El Salvador. There were no injuries, it said.
   So far 91 people have died and 309 have been wounded in the
military campaign launched last week by the FMLN.
   The rebel high command said the push is aimed at pushing the
government into making concessions at the negotiating table on
sweeping reforms in the armed forces.

   Sikh militants forced a Hindu man inside
his home in a Punjab town and fatally shot him, his parents and a
sister on Monday, police said.
   Press Trust of India said the gunmen shot three neighbors while
fleeing after the attack in Ludhiana, 96 miles south of Amritsar,
the center of a Sikh secessionist movement.
   Senior police superintendent Paramjit Singh Sandhu said four
Sikh militants drove in a car to the shop of a HIndu youth and led
him at gunpoint to his home next door.
   Inside, the gunmen fired indiscriminately with Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles, killing the man, his 60-year-old father Ram
Lubhya, his mother and a sister. The names of the other victims
were not immediately available.
   The slayings were the latest in a series of organized killings
by Sikh extremists in the northern state where they want to set up
an independent nation.
   On Sunday, Sikh gunmen raided a shopping center and a
residential neighborhood in another Punjab town and killed 16
Hindus in indiscriminate gunfire. The attack occurred 56 miles east
of Amritsar.
   Police said Sikh militants killed three Hindus in separate
attacks on Monday in Tarn Taran district outside Amritsar.
   Elsewhere in the state, a rich farming district on the Pakistani
border, seven people were killed by the militants, Press Trust of
India said.
   Sikh extremists have killed 231 people the past two weeks in
ambushes, bombings and massacres in the state. Victims have
included Hindu passengers pulled out of buses, shoppers, residents,
policemen and Hindus doing morning exercises.
   At least 2,975 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
the Sikh insurgency. Sikh separatists began their campaign for
independence in 1982, complaining of political and economic
discrimination by the majority Hindus.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority over Hindus in Punjab, but
nationwide they comprise 2 percent of India's 880 million people.
Hindus comprise 82 percent.

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Kuan Yew, prime minister of this island
republic for 31 years, submitted his resignation on Monday to make
way for his handpicked successor.
   Lee, who had been expected to step down, gave his letter of
resignation to President Wee Kim Wee. Lee's chosen successor,
Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 49, is to be sworn in on
Wednesday.
   Lee, 67, is to remain as a senior minister in Goh's Cabinet and
also continue as secretary-general of the ruling People's Action
Party, which holds 80 of the 81 elected seats in Parliament.
   Goh recently appointed Lee's eldest son, Trade and Industry
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 38, as one of two deputy prime ministers.
   Political analysts say that Lee's retention of the party
leadership and the ascendency of his son will ensure that no
fundamental changes will take place.
   Goh himself has said his administration plans no major policy
initiatives.
   Goh has been first deputy prime minister of Singapore since
1984. Currently minister of defense as well as deputy prime
minister, he served a 13-year apprenticeship in Lee's Cabinet.
   Goh said the current session of Parliament would end about two
months after he takes over, following enactment of a bill to change
the office of president. Parliament is to amend the constitution to
elect and give executive powers to the now ceremonial and
appointive presidency.
   Lee suggested the changes in 1984, but insists he is not
interested in the revamped presidency.
   Goh has a master's degree in economics from Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., and was a shipping executive before entering
politics.

<HEAD>Daily News Sues Strikers, Loses Major Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, fighting to keep advertisers and
circulation in the midst of a strike by union employees, sued 11
people for allegedly burning a delivery truck, stealing bundled
papers or attacking replacement drivers.
   Each of the three lawsuits filed in state court Nov. 20 seeks
$100,000 in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages.
They claim the defendants have hurt the paper's ability to do
business.
   On Nov. 23, one of the News' biggest advertisers, Macy's
department store, said it had dropped its ads in the paper.
   The News' two tabloid rivals, the New York Post and New York
Newsday, have reported large advertising and circulation gains
since the strike began Oct. 25.
   ``This is obviously all strike-related,'' Newsday spokeswoman
Chiara Coletti said.
   Newsday's Nov. 23 paper had 192 advertising pages, 24 more than
a year ago. The Post on the same day had 90 ad pages, 40 more than
last year's. The Daily News, which declined to comment on the
departure of advertisers, had 47 pages of advertising.
   Nine unions are striking the newspaper over what they term
unfair labor conditions.
   The Daily News has published every day since the strike began,
but many vendors have declined to sell it.
   It had a daily circulation of 1.09 million before the strike.
The newspaper said it is now printing 600,000 papers a day and
getting 400,000 to customers.
   New York Newsday officials said their paper's daily circulation
has risen from about 150,000 before the strike to about 340,000.
The paper's Long Island edition has a circulation of about 600,000.
   Post officials said their newspaper's circulation is up from
about 500,000 before the strike to between 700,000 and 750,000.
   The News' lawsuits filed in connection with the strike include
videotapes made by management, said John T. Sloan, vice president
for human resources.
   One lawsuit claims that a member of the striking drivers union
set fire to a truck outside the paper's Brooklyn printing plant.
   Another claims two Wall Street Journal drivers stole bundles of
the News that had been left off at a drop-off point by non-union
drivers.
   The third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking non-union
drivers and independent distributors at a paper drop-off point.
   In a separate court action, strikers won a victory when U.S.
District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein issued a temporary
restraining order Nov. 20 permitting striking pressmen to expand
pickets outside the Brooklyn plant.
   The pressmen complained management and police infringed on their
rights by confining pickets to side streets on either end of the
block-long plant.
   Strike leaders have complained that police have taken the
company's side in the dispute. On Nov. 19, union officials
presented Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown with a letter asking
that the department investigate ``growing hostility by police
officers against Daily News workers.''
   Daily News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson called the union
allegations outrageous.
   ``The police are just trying to preserve peace and justice,''
she said. ``They're out there trying to do their job. All around
them crimes are happening at the hands of the union.''
   A spokesman for the department said the cost of police staffing
plus overtime since the strike began was estimated at more than
$5.6 million. Police have recorded about 195 strike-related
incidents and made at least 89 arrests, said Officer Scott Bloch,
the spokesman. He said most of the incidents reported have involved
attacks on Daily News trucks and allegations of harassment of
vendors.

<HEAD>CNN Hands Over Noriega Prison Tapes to Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN has turned over its tapes of Manuel Noriega's
jailhouse phone calls so that a federal magistrate can help
determine whether Noriega's right to a fair trial has been
jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes Nov. 20 after
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's trial on
drug trafficking charges and will weigh a defense request to
dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind the order not to
broadcast the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed near Miami on charges of taking
bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't expected to
begin before the spring.

<HEAD>Missouri Town Bracing for Journalists Covering Quake Projection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a controversial projection about a
massive Midwest earthquake, some residents along the New Madrid
Fault are more worried about getting knocked down by a TV truck
than a temblor in early December.
   ``We've got reporters running out our ears,'' New Madrid Police
Chief Jim Helms said. ``They've been here from Washington,
Michigan, Kansas City, Oklahoma and as far south as Houston, Texas.
We've had them every day.''
   New Madrid, a town of about 3,300 in southeastern Missouri, has
become earthquake central for much of the media zeroing in on Iben
Browning's projection and the accompanying anxiety in the region.
   Browning is a New Mexico scientist-business consultant who says
his research shows conditions will be right for a major earthquake
along the New Madrid Fault about Dec. 2-3. He has projected a 50-50
chance.
   He based his projections on tidal forces, which will be
particularly strong at that time. Most scientists discount his
tidal theory but say that eventually there will be a powerful
earthquake along the fault.
   Browning's projection nevertheless has led school officials in
communities in at least four states to call off classes. It also
has renewed attention to earthquake preparedness in a region that
experiences several hundred tremors a year that range from minor to
imperceptible.
   The New Madrid Fault zone runs roughly from Marked Tree in
northeast Arkansas, across the Missouri Bootheel and up to near
Cairo in southern Illinois.
   Since reports of Browning's work came to light earlier this
year, the media have focused increasing attention on the New Madrid
zone.
   Television stations from throughout the region have done
ratings-month series on the projection, the fault zone and
earthquake preparedness. Reporters have descended from Detroit,
Minneapolis, Baltimore and Tampa, Fla. People magazine and the
television program ``Unsolved Mysteries'' also have been to town.
   Although New Madrid residents have become used to being
interviewed, the town is bracing for Monday, Dec. 3, when the
reporters, photographers, engineers and producers are expected back
en masse. Helms said three blocks may be roped off to accommodate
the television satellite trucks that will roll into town. Motel
rooms have been snatched up.
   Maor Dick Phillips is understanding. He'll have to work as
usual at Phillips Fertilizer Co. on Dec. 3 and then conduct a city
council meeting that evening, but he'll also try to be available
for interviews.
   The situation raises questions for the media: Is the possibility
of an earthquake, discounted by most experts, a story? Do you send
a reporter just in case, or do you ignore it and hope you don't
miss what could be the region's biggest story of the year?
   Editors across the country are deciding.
   ``We're going mainly expecting nothing to happen,'' said Susan
Okie, acting science editor at the Washington Post. ``This is a
story because of the excitement it's generated.''
   The feeling is the same at the Baltimore Sun, said National
Editor Ed Goodpaster.
   ``It's like any other prediction. There are those that you
really have to pay attention to to see whether anything does
happen,'' Goodpaster said. ``If it does happen, you're in a good
position to report on it, and if it doesn't happen, it's a good
story, too.''

<HEAD>Kids Dress Up Magazines for Troops in Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American teen-agers in Germany have
launched a ``cover-up'' mission for Persian Gulf soldiers yearning
for reading material.
   Using marking pens and an eye for what may offend Saudi
sensibilities, the teens have been drawing over pictures of
scantily clad people and advertisements for alcohol and tobacco
products.
   ``The original plan was that they were just going to cut out the
pictures, but after the first three magazines they had edited out,
there was nothing left,'' said U.S. Air Force 2nd Lt. Bryan
Stokstad, who organized the magazine drive.
   Stokstad said he got the idea after reading an article in the
unofficial military newspaper Stars and Stripes ``that the morale
down there was just a little bit low'' because troops didn't have
enough current publications.
   ``They were receiving the Stars and Stripes, but they were
getting issues a week late, and just for them to circulate around
it would take even longer,'' Stockstad said Nov. 22.
   Since the project was started in mid-October the volunteers have
sent out 2,500 pounds of magazines to Saudi Arabia through the
military postal system.

<HEAD>Cave-In Forces UPI To Evacuate Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International had to evacuate its
headquarters after a cave-in at an adjacent construction site Nov.
20. The news service continued to operate with help from Reuters
and from National Public Radio.
   A 100-foot-long section of sidewalk and part of a downtown
street slid into the four-story-deep hole as workers tried to shore
up the construction site from an earlier collapse. No injuries were
reported.
   The cave-in forced other businesses to evacuate and threatened
to cut power to portions of downtown.
   UPI moved some of its operations to its computer headquarters in
Vienna, Va., and to the Senate press gallery at the Capitol. The
staff began returning to the headquarters building the following
day. Spokesman Milt Capps said Reuters helped UPI distribute
photographs to its clients, and National Public Radio was helping

<HEAD>Newspaper Changes Policy in Abuse Reporting After Court Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHERIDAN, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sheridan Press was threatened with a
contempt of court citation for a story written about a pre-trial
hearing in a child abuse case.
   In the story, the victim was reported to be the defendant's
daughter. The newspaper did not name the victim, but did report
that she was the daughter of the accused, who was named.
   District Court Judge James Wolfe said the daughter was
implicitly identified.
   ``In the story you identified the victim,'' the judge wrote.
``In the court file is an order restricting information that would
identify the minor victim.''
   Sheridan Press Managing Editor Bruce Moats said after talking
with the counselor involved in the abuse case - and before he
received the judge's letter on Nov. 16 - he changed newspaper
policy and will no longer identify the relationship of victims in
pre-trial hearings.

<HEAD>Sunday Grit Shutting Down, National Grit To Remain </HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Grit weekly newspaper will
stop publishing at the end of the year, Executive Editor Michael R.
Rafferty said.
   Rafferty said the newspaper's owner, Stauffer Communications
Inc., decided to close it after the daily Williamsport Sun-Gazette
announced plans to launch a Sunday edition.
   ``Stauffer doesn't feel this market can support two Sunday
newspapers,'' Rafferty said Nov. 20.
   Sunday Grit has a staff of 16, half of them editorial employees.
The company said some of them will be offered jobs at Grit
magazine, a national, general-interest weekly that Stauffer
publishes from Williamsport.
   Stauffer bought Grit from Advo Systems in 1983, which had bought
it two years earlier from the Lamade family of Williamsport. The
newspaper was started in 1884.

<HEAD>Newspaper Editor Accused of Impersonating Prosecutor Cleared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FEASTERVILLE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed all charges Nov. 20
against the former chief editor of the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat,
accused of impersonating a state prosecutor and pressuring a man
suing his brother to back off.
   Theodore N. Beitchman won the dismissal after he and a former
subordinate testified he was not at work when the harassing
telephone calls were made.
   Beitchman, who resigned as editor in chief after his arrest Oct.
1, told District Justice Susan McEwen he went home sick after
working less than a half-hour on March 13, the day of the telephone
calls.
   The newspaper's managing editor, Larry Hudson, testified that he
supervised the newspaper's production that day, supporting
Beitchman's contention.
   Beitchman, 44, was accused of calling Henry Malinowski,
identifying himself as an assistant attorney general and pressuring
Malinowski to drop a lawsuit against Beitchman's brother.
   Telephone showed the calls were made from the Johnstown
newspaper to Malinowski's home and business on March 13, but McEwen
said there was no proof Beitchman made them.
   Chief Deputy District Attorney Ted Fritsch said he was
considering refiling charges, using additional evidence, but he
declined to elaborate.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of an independent Mormon magazine
that reported reprimands of church members have been punished
themselves, a Salt Lake newspaper said.
   Temple privileges of Daniel H. Rector, publisher of Sunstone,
and Elbert E. Peck, the magazine's editor, were revoked after the
article was published in mid-October, The Salt Lake Tribune
reported.
   The magazine story recounted the church's reaction to news
accounts about changes in Mormon Church temple ceremonies. Those
ceremonies are secret, and in the past the church has imposed
penalties for those who discussed them.
   The Sunstone article said that after initial media accounts
appeared, church officials directed local representatives to have
every known member who was quoted called in and questioned.
   ``The offending Sunstone article was nothing more than a
recap,'' said Ross Peterson, co-editor of Dialogue: A Journal of
Mormon Thought. ``It was only reporting on what had been
reported.''
   Rector declined comment. Peck said, ``My standing with the
church is a private matter between me and my church leaders.''
   Jerry Cahill, spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, said he had no information on the matter.

   The former publisher of the Hobbs Daily
News-Sun sued the newspaper's owners in a dispute over the handling
of legal advertisements.
   The lawsuit by George Moore names the Sun Publishing Corp. and
Shearman Corp., co-owners of the newspaper, and advertising
director Paul Carter.
   Moore contends a June letter from Carter falsely implied that
Moore established a $25 affidavit fee for legal ads without the
approval of his superiors.
   The letter said that after Moore started the fee, attorneys
switched much of their legal advertising to a competing newspaper.
The News-Sun has since resumed providing the affidavits free of
charge.
   Moore's Nov. 1 lawsuit said the letter ``was calculated to, and
did, hold plaintiff up to scorn, hatred and ridicule'' and was
intended to suggest that Moore was incompetent. Moore said he was
discharged without cause after a year and a half as publisher.
   He was replaced in March by Maynard Woodhatch of the Shearman
Newspaper Group, who said the company denies Moore's allegations
and will fight the suit in court.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national newspaper Tempo announced
it was shutting down, making it the ninth major victim of
Portugal's collapsing press market.
   The weekly, closing the week of Nov. 26, was founded in 1975 as
a conservative voice, while much of the media swung to the left
following a 1974 revolution that overthrew the country's
dictatorship.
   The paper, which had a circulation of 71,000 in 1978, now sells
about 17,000 copies.
   Investors who hoped for advertising revenue in one of Europe's
fastest growing economies fed a press boom in the 1980s. But the
market was unable to sustain the increasing number of papers in a
country where almost 20 percent of the 10.3 million people are
illiterate.
   The government hopes to boost the news industry by privatizing
state-owned papers. Several have been sold and the last remaining
state-owned paper, Diario de Noticias, is scheduled for
privatization next year.

<HEAD>First Women's Tabloid in Japan Seems Unlikely To Break New Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a shocking-pink picture of Tokyo's skyline
gracing its front page, Japan's first newspaper designed for women
- Lady Kong - hit the newsstands Nov. 26 with lots of fluff but
little feminism.
   As with virtually all enterprises here, men run the daily
tabloid, leading some critics to complain that the publication is
not likely to challenge the subservient role of women in Japanese
society.
   ``Everything, even sanitary napkins, has been planned and
produced by men,'' said Harueko Kato, a communications professor at
Tokyo Women's Christian University. ``And news coverage is not an
exception.''
   The tabloid's name refers to King Kong's girlfriend. The name
apparently is meant to show that women are strong, too.
   Kato believes the most important aspect of the new newspaper
will be ``how the opinions of the female employees are reflected in
hhe decision-making and news writing.''
   That will depend to a large extent on Masahiro Oshima, the
41-year-old man who is the tabloid's editorial director.
   Twenty-seven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are
women, but they are in charge of only the entertainment and city
guide sections.
   The company specifically recruited male writers to work in the
news department, Oshima explained, ``to give news stories a serious
tone.''
   Despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its
odd name and advertisements suggesting greater independence for
women, there appears to be little emphasis on feminism and social
issues.
   The leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for
Tokyo's commuter trains to extend operations a few hours each night
to 2 a.m. for the benefit of people who stay out late drinking and
dancing.
   The rest of the 80-cent newspaper, which describes itself in
English as a ``newsy tabloid for Tokyoites,'' reads like a typical
fashion magazine with a few pages of news slapped onto the front.
   Oshima said he had wanted to carry more features on social
issues, but a six-month marketing research program led him to
reduce stories on politics, business, women's issues and the
environment.

   CBS Inc. said it plans to cut the payments it
makes to affiliate stations for carrying its programs by 20 percent
next year. The network said that could save it about $30 million.
   The announcement Nov. 20 came a day after CBS announced that it

   It cited the deteriorating national advertising climate and the
costs of entertainment and sports programs for its financial

   CBS paid its affiliates $153 million this year in compensation.
The company said that was more than either major network
competitor, NBC or ABC, paid their affiliates. CBS estimated NBC
pays $132 million a year to its affiliates while ABC pays an
estimated $110 million
   CBS said that in an effort to reduce the impact of the
compensation cuts, it was planning to give the local stations more
commercial time in news and sports programming to sell to local
advertisers. In addition, CBS said it would increase local
commercial time on broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses TV Station of Sex Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
filed a sex discrimination lawsuit on Nov. 19 against WBAL-TV,
claiming the station fired an anchorwoman who demanded the same pay
as her male counterparts.
   EEOC Chairman Evan Kemp Jr. said the agency found that Ruth Ann
``Rudy'' Miller was paid less than her male counterparts for
similar duties and fired in 1989 because she demanded equal pay.
   Miller earned $141,000 a year when she was fired, compared to
$170,000 and $180,000 for two male anchormen, the EEOC said.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court, also claims Miller was
given different assignments and faced increased scrutiny of her
clothes and hairstyle because she is a woman. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified back wages and damages.
   Miller filed her own lawsuit in January alleging similar
violations. She demanded $200,000 in damages.
   David Barrett, station vice president and general manager,
denied the allegations. He said Miller earned less because she
refused to anchor the 11 p.m. newscast. She had been anchoring the
noon and 5 p.m. newscasts when her contract was not renewed.
   Miller, 41, is now host of a daily radio talk show in Baltimore
and publishes the monthly Maryland Family Magazine. She said if the
lawsuit ``helps other women, God, that's great.''
   Gerald Kiel, EEOC regional attorney, said the commission sued
after negotiations to reach a settlement failed.

   President Bush is heading to Mexico for a
two-day visit to advance the two nations' goal of enacting an open
trading policy across their border.
   Bush's itinerary today called for consultations with President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on trade and other U.S.-Mexico issues.
The trip marks a shift of hemispheric focus three days after Bush's
return from a Thanksgiving trip to the Middle East.
   Salinas was welcoming Bush to his hometown of Agualeguas and
taking him to a rodeo before hosting him for lunch and talks at

   NEW YORK (AP) - The Bush administration is ready to ask the
United Nations Security Council to approve military force to
liberate Kuwait unless Iraq withdraws its troops by Jan. 1, U.S.
officials say.
   The proposed resolution was circulated as the council prepared
for today's start of a week-long debate on the Persian Gulf crisis.
If adopted, it would mark the strongest step taken by the council
since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded his oil-rich neighbor
Aug. 2.
   The Jan. 1 deadline ``is not locked in concrete,'' a U.S.
official told The Associated Press Sunday night. This leaves room
for more maneuvering as the Bush administration tries to maintain
an international alliance against the invasion amid Soviet
reservations about using military force without trying further
diplomacy.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had demanded the Iraqi
invaders leave Kuwait by the end of the year. ``We've just kind of
formalized it'' in the proposed resolution, he said.

23 percent and Mazowiecki had 16 percent, the national election
commission reported. The rest was split among three minor
candidates.
   Tyminski, a virtual political unknown, returned to his homeland
only this fall after 21 years in Canada and Peru. He apparently
impressed Poles worn by economic hardship and the political scrap
that split Solidarity.

   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - Ten years after Ronald Reagan extinguished
the Sagebrush Rebellion by moving into the White House, the
modern-day range war is rekindling.
   Fearful of losing control over their own land and losing access
to natural resources on public lands, at least 50 ranchers, miners,
loggers and local government officials plan to meet in Las Vegas on
Friday to develop a strategy to combat the Bush administration and
the conservation movement.
   Those who participated in the rebellion in an effort to have
Bureau of Land Management property turned over to the states say
President Bush's environmental leanings are jeopardizing their
livelihoods.
   ``I think the new push by President Bush, that he wants to be
the environmental president for the century, has certainly caused
an uproar,'' says Dean Rhoads, the Nevada rancher and lawmaker who
spearheaded the rebellion in 1979.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers looking for ways to trim the federal
deficit can cut defense spending and even raise taxes if they have
to. But they have found they'd better not touch Social Security.
   This year, Social Security will dispense about $265 billion -
more than one-fifth of all federal spending. But the program was
untouched in the deficit-reduction package enacted last month.
   And new budget rules make Social Security virtually untouchable
in the future.
   The reason has much to do with the political power of the
elderly, but also with the program's overall popularity, analysts
and lawmakers say.
   ---&equals;
   TOKYO (AP) - With a shocking-pink picture of Tokyo's skyline
gracing its front page, Japan's first newspaper designed for women
- Lady Kong - hit the newsstands today with lots of fluff but
little feminism.
   As with virtually all enterprises here, men run the daily
tabloid, leading some critics to complain that the publication is
not likely to challenge the subservient role of women in Japanese
society.
   ``Everything, even sanitary napkins, has been planned and
produced by men,'' said Harueko Kato, a communications professor at
Tokyo Women's Christian University. ``And news coverage is not an
exception.''
   The tabloid's name refers to King Kong's girlfriend. The name
apparently is meant to show that women are strong, too.

   MADISON, Wis. (AP) - AIDS is no laughing matter at the Safer Sex
Boutique, but the unique shop offers such lighthearted gifts as
condom-shaped candy and boxer shorts adorned with smiling condom
cartoons that glow in the dark.
   Shoppers also can buy earrings and key chains that discreetly
store condoms inside, or use a computer that calculates a person's
likelihood of exposure to AIDS.
   The unusual store, open this holiday season, is a commercial
experiment to market both silly and serious products that promote
safe sex and draw attention to the needs of those who have acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``This is designed to talk about and promote safer sex by making
it more fun and exciting,'' said Dave Rompa, executive director of
the AIDS Support Network in Madison, an advocacy group that helped
develop the business.

<HEAD>Deficit-Counting Rules Keep Changing, But Numbers Still Get Worse</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite new rules, new taxes and a new scoring
system, all part of the five-year plan advertised as tough deficit
control, the federal debt numbers are about to get worse, rising to
record levels next year.
   They're supposed to get better later.
   But the deal President Bush called good medicine for the deficit
problem is not a cure, only a first dose.
   That leaves both sides of the bargain with some explaining to do
as the budget cycle begins again next winter.
   Congress and the White House both left the impression that their
five-year budget agreement charts the way out of chronic deficits.
It took the better part of seven months, and in the process,
according to budget director Richard Darman, ``the political system
seems to have exhausted (even disgusted) itself with its effort.''
   ``There is an ironic tendency to pretend that the deficit
problem is over with, and that it is time to change the subject,''
Darman said in a speech this month. ``As a result, there may be
less political restraint on the generation of new ideas and
initiatives.''
   While nobody said the problem was solved, Bush and Democratic
leaders said it had been tamed. And political rhetoric obscured the
fine print of red numbers to come.
   ``It's cut about $492 billion over five years off the deficit;
that's progress,'' Bush said shortly before the Nov. 6 elections.
``And $350 billion of that was in spending cuts ... And we did put
Congress - and this is the most important part of it - on a
pay-as-you-go plan.''
   Some of those reductions are based on a system of counting that
Bush had spent part of the campaign criticizing as
inside-the-beltway arithmetic, in which reductions are figured
against projected levels and so serve to limit future increases,
not to cut from actual past performance.
   In his assessment on Nov. 16, Darman said the five-year deal was
a fair one, with ``the toughest enforcement system ever'' on
federal spending. But he also said:
   ``The deficit will, in any case, rise to record levels before
turning down.''
   Darman estimated the deficit for the current budget year will be
between $250 and $300 billion when the books are closed next Sept.
30. For the year just ended, the deficit was $220.4 billion, just
short of the record high of 1986.
   There will be new, almost certainly higher deficit projections
in the budget Bush is to send to Congress by Feb. 4.
   The new budget deal eliminates the system of annual deficit
targets that were supposed to be enforced by automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts. The targets are adjustable now,
depending on circumstances. For the current budget year and the two
to follow, the new process sets limits in three categories:
domestic, defense and foreign aid. When spending exceeds the
ceiling, automatic spending cuts would be triggered on all the
programs in that category.
   That strengthens the administration hand in enforcing spending
restraints because the Office of Management and Budget will be
keeping score, and thus deciding when automatic cuts are warranted.
   The new law also requires pay-as-you-go measures to offset any
tax reductions or increased entitlement spending programs.
   It is an intricate process that comes with no guarantees.
   ``With legally binding spending caps and the new pay-as-you-go
system, we may be able to break free, somewhat, from the consume
now, promise to pay later approach,'' Darman said, hedging his
forecast.
   It sounded simpler and surer in the shorthand of the campaign.
   ``Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the
Congress and between the branches over budget matters,'' Bush said
before the final deal was fashioned. ``It is high time we pulled
together and got the job done right.''

<TEXT>
   The fall television season is 10 weeks old.
Do you know where your favorite show is?
   The sheer number of this season's new programs is bad enough. At
30-something and counting, the four broadcast networks have made
history by introducing the highest number of fall shows ever.
   Not to mention all the time changes and cancellations that
accompany any new season. In the resulting fallout, you can't find
a cherished show with a Geiger counter.
   Let's start with Monday.
   Turn to CBS at 8 p.m. to find the rotund star of ``Uncle Buck''
making his usual gross-out jokes.
   Fat chance. ``Uncle Buck'' has moved to Fridays at 8 p.m.,
switching with ``Evening Shade,'' the new creation of Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason, executive producers of CBS'
hit series ``Designing Women.''
   At 10 p.m., ``Face to Face With Connie Chung'' made room for
mommy after the star announced she was chucking her weekly series
to ``aggressively'' pursue having a baby with Maury Povitch, her
tabloid TV journalist husband.
   In place of ``Face to Face,' CBS put ``The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill,'' in which the terminally cranky title character, played
by Sharon Gless, dumps her rich trappings, but not her Malibu home,
to become a public defender.
   On Tuesday, ABC's ``Baby Talk'' never made it to the delivery
room after star Connie Sellecca left in a contractual dispute. The
comedy series, spun from the hugely successful feature film ``Look
Who's Talking,'' was rescheduled as a mid-season replacement.
   ``Head of the Class'' was put in the 8:30 p.m. slot with a new
star to replace Howard Hesseman, who quit. The series about a high
school honors class is rumored to be inches from the cancellation
ax. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that in more than
four years, not one of those extra-smart kids has ever graduated.
   Still with us? If the time changes seem confusing, take a look
at the title changes that accompany the plethora of new shows.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s dismally rated ``Class of Beverly Hills''
became ``Beverly Hills 90210'' (perhaps Fox thought including the
zip code would make it easier for viewers to find).
   The medical series ``Signs of Life'' on NBC became
``Lifestories.'' No matter the title, the show needs CPR. Although
a favorite of network entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff,
the low-rated program leaves its 8 p.m. Sunday time slot next week.
NBC has said it will experiment with new times.
   The network's ``Hull St. High'' became simply ``Hull High''
before flunking out of prime time altogether.
   CBS' ``The Hammersmiths'' became ``Sons and Daughters'' (series
star Lucie Arnaz said this summer that the former title sounded
like a toe disease). Evidently, the new name was not enough to
ready the series for prime time. More than two months into the fall
schedule, it has yet to premiere.
   The widowed firefighter father and ``Four Alarm Family'' became
``The Family Man,'' but failed to burn up the ratings. CBS
announced last week that the show was going off the air Dec. 15.
   On Wednesday, big bucks and a big name could not save ``Cop
Rock.'' The highly touted ABC series by ``Hill Street Blues''
creator Steven Bochco leaves the air Dec. 26. In its stead will be
``Equal Justice,'' the densely populated law show that premiered as
a replacement series last season.
   CBS pulled ``Lenny'' from its 8 p.m. time period, moved ``Doctor
Doctor'' to Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. and put ``48 Hours'' in the
one-hour vacancy that resulted. After a brief hiatus, ``Lenny''
returns to television Dec. 15 at 8:30 p.m.
   On Thursday, CBS moved its expensively produced super-hero
series ``The Flash'' to 8:30 p.m. (leaving NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and Fox's ``The Simpsons'' to duke it out in the 8 p.m. slot).
   On Fridays, Fox killed ``D.E.A.,'' its new series about the Drug
Enforcement Administration, and moved ``Against The Law'' to fill
the 9 p.m. void.
   The stand-up comedian show ``Comic Strip Live'' was introduced
in ``Against The Law's'' old time period of 10 p.m. Sunday.
   The CBS Saturday night schedule got a complete overhaul. ``The
Hogan Family'' moved from NBC to CBS this season. On Dec. 15, it
moves to oblivion when CBS yanks it in favor of ``Lenny,'' and
jerks ``The Family Man'' in favor of a new series starring Nell
Carter called ``You Take The Kids.''
   CBS' ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' went six feet under early in the
season. ``Broken Badges,'' a new series about cops on psychiatric
leave, took the leftover 9 p.m. slot last Saturday. The 10 p.m.
period left by ``48 Hours'' now is occupied by ``Wiseguy,'' which
also has been marked for cancellation.
   The shuffling will continue. After the holidays, network
officials begin gearing up for new, mid-season replacements.
   Let's hope they write the schedules in pencil.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Once the darling of the American psyche, the
space agency is past the days of Glenn and Armstrong, the
adventures of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. It has a more work-a-day
task today, and when it stumbles, the thud seems louder. How to
avoid the stumbles and design a viable future are the less than
flashy objects today.

   NASA, the can-do agency that could
do no wrong during the early, heady days of space exploration, is
now middle-aged and suffering the consequences of having so stellar
a past.
   ``When we stub our toes, that gets noticed and we get held
against this very high standard,'' says NASA Administrator Richard
Truly.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has done more
than stub its toes this year, according to many observers. It's
shot itself in the foot.
  ``They're the team that can't shoot straight,'' says Alex
Roland, a former NASA historian who teaches history at Duke
University. Roland believes NASA can restore its former luster by
sticking to missions that are certain to be accomplished.
   The list of misses since summer is painfully long.
   - NASA failed to notice the Hubble Space Telescope's flawed
mirror until the $1.5 billion observatory was in orbit.
   - It grounded the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks in two
of three spaceships. Almost half a year went by without a launch -
the second-longest grounding in shuttle history.
   ``All that happened at the very worst time for us, with Congress
coming up on the final deliberations on the budget,'' Truly says.
   Although NASA ended up with $13.8 billion, 13 percent more than
last year's budget, it was denied money for President Bush's plan
to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars. It also lost
more than a half-billion dollars for space station design work and
was ordered by Congress to come up with a more efficient plan by
February for building the station.
   ``Certainly the biggest job we've got to do in the next few
months is to get the space station program in sync with the budget
realities,'' says J.R. Thompson, NASA's second-in-command.
   Gone are the moonstruck days of Apollo in the late 1960s, when
NASA's budget accounted for a record 3.85 percent of total federal
spending and 34,000 people worked for the agency. This year's space
spending represents about 1.1 percent of the U.S. budget, and the
work force totals some 24,000.
   ``We've probably lost some of the skills we need,'' said James
Beggs, who headed NASA from 1981 to 1986. ``We fill in with
contractors. There's nothing wrong with that, except their
motivation is not the same.''
   NASA's most embarrassing accident this year involved employees
of Lockheed Space Operations Co., NASA's prime contractor for
shuttle processing. The workers forgot to remove a 9-foot-long,
bright yellow beam from Atlantis, and it banged around the engine
compartment as the orbiter was being hoisted into an upright
position in October.
   While Truly admits NASA is more bureaucratic than it was during
the Apollo era, he denies the quality of work is inferior to what
existed during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs that
eventually put man on the moon. Critics repeatedly disagree.
   ``You can sit inside the (Washington) beltway and make those
judgments all day long. They're just not factual,'' Thompson says.
   ``We were up to our neck in problems in the Apollo program,''
Thompson says, citing numerous examples. ``We were flying by the
seat of our pants in a lot of those missions.''
   Nevertheless, NASA officials have started putting more emphasis
on quality. In fact, it's become a campaign.
   ``The more I look at what can be done with the kinds of people
we have and the more I look at the parts of NASA that I think have
become more bureaucratic, the way we push paper, the way we write
our memos, the way we process our hardware, there's hardly an area
that can't be improved simply by reminding people that excellence
goes into a product when you first make it,'' Truly says.
   In Truly's view, the only real problem is that NASA is ``far
more complex and far more broad'' than at any other time in its
32-year history.
   ``It no longer has a simple, single purpose,'' Truly says.
   To help define NASA's goals over the coming decade, the White
House last summer appointed the Advisory Committee on the Future of
the U.S. Space Program. The panel, headed by Martin Marietta Corp.
Chairman Norman Augustine, is expected to report its findings as
early as December.
   Norman Parmet chairman of NASA's aerospace safety advisory
panel, is among those hoping to hear specifics. He is a retired
vice president of engineering for Trans World Airlines.
   ``What I think is necessary is the top of this government, Mr.
Bush's organization, ought to establish not in general terms like
we're going to go to Mars, but what's the purpose of NASA. Spell it
out and then make sure NASA adheres to the direction it's given,''
Parmet says.
   As it stands now, NASA's plans constantly change ``because of
lack of government leadership and then government micro-manages in
the legislative area,'' Parmet says. ``It's not NASA's fault. It's
not Congress' fault. It's a combination of all of it. It's like
chasing your own tail.''
   What's also necessary, according to Parmet, is making NASA's
scattered field centers less self-serving and instead ``subservient
to the whole.'' The centers often compete against each other for
high-profile projects, and work sometimes is duplicated.
   Historian Roland considers it ``silly'' to even be talking about
going to the moon and Mars given the current state of affairs,
financial and otherwise.
   ``It's not to say they aren't legitimate long-term goals or
perhaps there won't be some reason to go there,'' Roland says.
``But there's no reason to race there as NASA wants to do.
   ``The Cold War is over. The Space War is over. We have the
freedom to design a rational program instead of a crash program to
get to Mars.''

   Much of NASA's future depend on the shuttle, which will mark its
10th flying anniversary in April. Twenty-four missions were
achieved before Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on
Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven aboard.
   Americans returned to space with discovery in September 1988. As
of the end of November, there have been 11 more flights with
another - the 38th shuttle mission - set for early December.
   Nine missions were scheduled for 1990, the same number as in
1985, the shuttle program's busiest year. This year's flight
schedule was disrupted, however, by hydrogen leaks that crippled
Columbia and Atlantis for months. Now six flights are expected.
   The goal for 1991 is seven or eight shuttle flights. Roland is
skeptical such a schedule can be kept, given that NASA's average
since 1981 is four missions a year. ``Anything over that is
optimistic,'' he says.
   Many, including Roland, question whether the shuttle is reliable
enough to build the space station. The shuttle program suffered a
$125 million budget cut this year, which will reduce NASA's
flexibility to respond to mechanical problems, said Keith Hudkins,
director of the shuttle obiter division.
   ``It's like anything else. You just do the mandatory things and
don't do a lot of the advance planning stuff,'' he said.
   Although the new shuttle Endeavour will expand the fleet to four
once it starts flying in early 1992. Columbia will be out of
commission for nearly half a year. NASA plans to send Columbia to
Rockwell International's shuttle assembly plant in Palmdale,
Calif., in July for modifications, The $175 million worth of work
will extend Columbia's maximum stay in space from 10 to 16 days.
   Henry Pohl, director of engineering at Johnson Space Center,
expects to see at least 10 shuttle flights a year by the mid-1990s,
based on a four-ship fleet. He also anticipates, eventually,
simultaneous flights.
   ``We have a constraint right now where we want to look at the
hardware before flying the next one,'' Pohl said ``How long do you
have to do that?''
   Each shuttle was designed for a 10-year lifetime and 100
flights, or 10 trips a year. Discovery is the most traveled
spaceship with 11 missions.
   New technology is being developed for a National Aero-Space
Plane that would fly directly into orbit from a conventional
runway. Pohl says such a craft is at least 20 years away, and a
fifth orbiter will be needed, and a sixth and a seventh.
   The reason for having so many shuttles, Pohl says, is that ``if
we fly long enough, we'll lose every one of them.''
   ``People need to realize this is a dangerous business,'' Pohl
says. ``Not many people think about it, but when the orbiter's in
orbit, it's flying eight times faster than a bullet when it leaves
the muzzle'' of a 30-caliber rifle.
   Beggs says it would be tragic if the space program, for whatever
reason, ground to a halt. ``I don't believe the American people
want that,'' he says.
   ``At a gut level, most people recognize that the space program
is like a great white fleet. It's a symbol of national prowess,''
says Joseph Loftus, assistant director for plans at Johnson Space
Center.
   Roland, who believes NASA should reduce but not eliminate the
amount spent on manned space, predicts the space agency's continued
existence will come into question if,or rather when, there is
another major setback.
   ``But there are also some hard issues of who would do some of
the things they do if they weren't there,'' Roland says. ``... it's
hard to really see eliminating NASA.''
   ``Despite all that anybody says, if we don't do this (space
exploration), we're going to end up being a second-class nation,''
Parmet says.
   No matter what NASA achieves in the next few decades, Truly
doubts it will generate the amount of fervor or pride that existed
in America after the space race was declared in the wake of
Sputnik.
   ``The Apollo years were a magical time we're not ever going to
capture again in precisely the same way,'' Truly says. ``When we go
to Mars, some of that will be back. Even then, it will probably be
in reality more of an international endeavor.
   ``You can only do first things once ... and that was a decade
everything we were doing was a first.''

   NASA's dreams are alive, but they're
in danger of fading fast.
   The proposed space station Freedom is reeling from a heavy
budget blow. So is the Space Exploration Initiative, President
Bush's plan for colonizing the moon early in the next century and
sending astronauts to Mars by 2019.
   Times are tougher than ever for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, and there's no indication next year - or the
next - will be any better.
   Congress, in an unprecedented move, has suggested that NASA cap
its economic growth at 8 percent to 10 percent a year through the
mid-1990s. NASA received $13.8 billion for fiscal 1991, $1.24
billion less than President Bush wanted but still $1.6 billion more
than last year.
   ``We've got to get our appetite more in line with the budget.
That's the single biggest charge that we've got today,'' says J. R.
Thompson, NASA's second-in-command.
   ``We cannot keep aspiring to programs and growth in programs
that are out of sync with the budget. The more we do that, the more
problems we create for ourselves.''
   It also causes problems for NASA's international partners, most
notably the European Space Agency. The ESA is collaborating with
NASA on the $38 billion space station project as well as numerous
other programs, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the solar
probe Ulysses.
   ``We recognize we're going to be faced with the vagaries of the
annual appropriations process,'' says Ian Pryke, head of the ESA's
Washington office. ``We don't like it, but that's the way life
is.''
   With the Europeans' help, NASA is redesigning the space station
to reflect this year's cut of more than a half-billion dollars and
future budget constraints. If there is not enough money to enable
the station to be permanently manned, ``then we ought to hang it
up,'' says William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   NASA still hopes to start building the station in 1995. But
because of all the revising, it won't be ready to permanently house
astronauts until after 2000, years later than planned.
   The Space Exploration Initiative, meanwhile, remains more or
less on hold. Congress refused to spend any money this year on the
project. Bush had requested $37 million in start-up funds.
   One of NASA's few projects that is running on time and below
cost is the new space shuttle Endeavour. Officials say that's
because the $2.1 billion requested to build Endeavour was awarded
all at once instead of in year-to-year installments, and involved
proven technology.
   ``The biggest problem we have had is not what the budget is but
the uncertainty as to what the budget will be,'' says Joseph Loftus
Jr., assistant director for plans at Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
   Endeavour, the fifth shuttle to be built, is scheduled to arrive
at Kennedy Space Center in the spring. Its first flight will be in
early 1992.

   NASA launched the space shuttle for
the first time nearly 10 years ago. Thirty-six flights have
followed, with another one - the 38th - planned for December.
   As of the end of November, 120 people had flown on the shuttle,
some of them several times. Seven were killed. One of four orbiters
was destroyed.
   Here are some of the highlights of America's shuttle program:
   April 12, 1981 - Columbia blasts off on the first shuttle
flight, putting Americans back in space after six years. The
mission lasted 54 hours.
   Nov. 12, 1981 - Columbia returns to space as the first reusable
spaceship.
   Nov. 11, 1982 - Columbia carries two communications satellites
into orbit, the first time a manned spaceship has a commercial
cargo.
   June 18, 1983 - Sally Ride becomes the first American woman to
fly in space.
   Aug. 30, 1983 - Guion Bluford Jr. becomes the first black to fly
in space.
   Nov. 28, 1983 - The first non-astronauts go into space, one of
them the first foreigner launched in a U.S. spaceship. It is also
the first Spacelab mission.
   Feb. 7, 1984 - Bruce McCandless II becomes the first person to
fly free in space, without being tethered to a craft. Two hours
later, Robert Stewart becomes the second.
   April 10, 1984 - George Nelson and James van Hoften perform the
first satellite repair in orbit, replacing a failed control system
and bad electronics box on the Solar Max spacecraft.
   Nov. 8, 1984 - Discovery lifts off on the first satellite
retrieval mission. Two communications spacecraft are snared from
orbit and returned to Earth.
   April 12, 1985 - The first politician, U.S. Sen. Jake Garn,
flies in space.
   July 29, 1985 - One of Challenger's three main engines shuts
down 5 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, forcing an
abort-to-orbit, in which a shuttle is sent into a lower orbit than
planned. It is the first in-flight engine cutoff.
   Nov. 29, 1985 - The first construction work is performed in
space. Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring assemble and disassemble a
beam and pyramid to test techniques being developed for building a
space station. They perform a similar spacewalking demonstration
two days later.
   Jan. 28, 1986 - Challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight,
killing all seven aboard. It is America's second space tragedy. The
1967 Apollo spacecraft fire, which killed three, was the first.
   Sept. 29, 1988 - America returns to space as Discovery blasts
off with five astronauts.
   May 4, 1989 - The first planetary probe - Venus-bound Magellan -
is launched from a shuttle.
   April 25, 1990 - The Hubble Space Telescope is deployed from
Discovery. NASA calls the orbiting observatory the greatest advance
in astronomy since Galileo's telescope.
   May 29, 1990 - Columbia's countdown is halted six hours before
liftoff when hydrogen fuel leaks from the shuttle.
   June 29, 1990 - Atlantis also is found to have hydrogen leaks,
and NASA temporarily grounds the entire fleet.
   Oct. 6, 1990 - Discovery lifts off with a sun probe, ending a
5{-month grounding that is the second-longest in shuttle history.

   Shopping mall patrons across the land are
screaming the same question: Do the kids think they own the place?
Well, among those teen-age hordes, some in fact do. Kicking them

   With Christmas shoppers breathing down their necks, the people
who run the nation's almost 35,000 shopping centers have an eye out
these days for the droves of teen-agers whose high jinks sometimes
explode in violence and whose presence sometimes intimidates other
shoppers.
   About a dozen shopping centers and malls have gone so far as to
ban teen-agers entirely at critical hours.
   And even those that haven't are looking for ways to cope with
youngsters who have adopted the comfortable and elegant mall
surroundings as second homes.
   At its fall meeting in Kansas City, the International Council of
Shopping Centers held a seminar titled ``Hanging Out: Whose
Shopping Mall Is It Anyway?''
   At McKinley Mall in Hamburg, N.Y., 15 miles from Buffalo, no one
under 20 is allowed inside between 6 and 10 p.m. on Fridays and
Saturdays, unless they are reporting for work or are accompanied by
an adult.
   The mall took the action after an estimated 600 teens inundated
the mall's food court one Friday night and a fight in the parking
lot spilled over into the common area.
   At the Randall Park Mall in North Randall, Ohio, the operators
don't allow unescorted teens at any hour. Even teen-agers going to
the theater must be brought and picked up.
   Omaha's Park Fair has banned people under 18.
   Beyond those shopping centers which have banned teens, far more
have reported trouble controlling teen crowds that clog common
areas, block store entrances and generally, if inadvertently,
intimidate customers.
   But banning teens has also posed an ironic conflict. Teens are
good customers. They spend a lot of money.
   Mall operators say the problems stem from changes in the
community, a growing number of two-income latchkey families and the
cuts made in school budgets, leaving the teens no place to go when
the closing bell rings. They are a new kind of temporarily
homeless, and the mall is a haven.
   The scene at Aurora Mall, outside Denver, Colo., this Christmas
is a study in contrast to a year ago.
   This year there are teen-age advisory boards at all eight high
schools in the mall's neighborhood, and each of these sends a
representative to a super advisory board that meets once a month at
the mall.
   These youngsters, with adult advisors drawn from the community,
help devise programs that can help revise adult perceptions about
teen-agers.
   So this Christmas they will field Customer Service Ambassadors,
drawn from the high schools, who will help adult customers with
their parcels, with directions to shops, and try to change adult
attitudes to the teen-age presence. There will also be teen-agers
available at the mall to wrap Christmas presents for customers.
   Consider last year. Mall operators began to notice a growing
number of youngsters in the spring of 1989. Susan Keene, general
manager, says they were congregating in large groups, ``acting out
in loud fashion'' and otherwise horsing around. ``We started
receiving complaints from our adult shoppers'' on Mondays following
the weekends.
   ``So in order to get rid of the problem and get rid of it fast,
we instituted a get-tough policy in the fall of 1989. It was a kind
of steamroller approach.''
   Youngsters were handed wallet-sized cards with rules of behavior
on them - no behavior likely to cause a disturbance, no sitting on
planter walls, no alcoholic beverages, no blocking store entrances.
After two weeks notice, they were given one warning and then
photographed and banned. Recalcitrants were arrested by local
police and charged with trespass.
   The mall was banning 10 to 15 youngsters every Saturday.
   But it didn't work. There was no decrease in teen-agers coming
to the mall. Harassment was not the answer. Furthermore, the mall
became the target of a boycott and pickets from the black
community, which perceived the tactic as being aimed at their
children.
   ``While only about 20 percent of Aurora Mall shoppers were
African-American,'' says manager Keene, ``about 75 percent of the
kids who come to the mall are African-American.''
   Clearly something else had to be done. The mall began with a
marketing survey, intercepting youngsters and holding discussion
groups to find out just who they were. What they found was
something of a surprise.

   The teens and their parents, they discovered, had a sense of
ownership of the mall, even though it was private property. They
felt it was their right to congregate there, not just to shop. The
youngsters came to be with their friends, to make dates, to find
out where the parties were, all of this in lieu of a school
environment which had suffered from budget cuts.
   The mall offered an elegant and inexpensive focus for the
youngsters, and in some cases a place they perceived as being safer
than their own neighborhoods. The youngsters, concerned about gang
activity in the community, saw the mall as safe haven.
   Stephen Huber of a Cleveland firm that manages a number of malls
says that on one occasion three teen gang members were standing at
an entrance to the mall when four members of a rival gang drove by.
The four turned the car around, got a running start, jumped the
curb and crashed into the entrance in an attempt to run down their
rivals.
   Oddly, gang activity is easier to deal with than the teen
problem, shopping center operators say, because the police know who
they are and what to do about them.
   Not so the average teens. The market survey showed that the
teens visited the Aurora Mall one to three times a week, visited an
average of 10 stores and spent an average of $64 a visit. Most of
them had sincere career aspirations, and in spite of their bizarre
dress and behavior were basically ``good kids.''
   So the mall operators set about changing their own mind-set, and
that of security people. Just because kids had intimidating
appearances and numbers, it didn't mean they were bad or that they
were any more bizarre than previous generations.
   The mall also hired a customer service director whose job is
more public relations than security, which also comes under his
purview. The accent is on politeness, requests to move on, or
please don't block the store front. It seems to be working.
   And the city of Aurora put a highly visible police mini-station
in the heart of the mall.
   There was a similar impasse at the Columbia Mall in Columbia,
S.C., where a heavy-handed approach eventually yielded to gentler
means. Without knowing it, the mall operator had used a strong but
old South Carolina law that permits the banning of people from
private property for six months under penalty of law.
   They used the law frequently, but then discovered it had been
passed as a tool for segregationists. There was a community uproar.
   Now the mall has a polite Customer Service Corps, neatly dressed
people in blazers and carrying radios and directories of stores.
They help customers with parcels, give directions, and act as new
sets of eyes and ears as they roam around the mall.
   The emergence of the mall as a prime community focal point has
been growing throughout the nation each year. The number of malls
and floor space has been growing about 7 percent a year, drawing
172.4 million adults, 70 percent of the population.
   Malls and shopping centers now number 34,683, and more than
1,500 new ones were started in 1989. One near Minneapolis plans to
house about 600 stores.
   So the teen problem can be expected to grow.
   Most expect teen banning to abate, however. Teens are a growing
$56 billion market, and this has not passed unnoticed.
   Bans quite naturally have alienated teens. At the McKinley Mall
in Hamburg, 15-year-old Jan Harris says, ``A lot of kids who are
here are straight. The reason they turn away people is that they're
different.'' She was banned from the mall when she sat on a bench
to rest. ``Is that a valid reason to kick someone out?'' she asked.
   By and large, McKinley merchants say, the ban has not affected
business as much as they feared.
   Ron Jefferson, who runs the Singing River Mall in Gautier,
Miss., which attracts as many as 200 teens on a weekend, has put in
an outside entrance to the game rooms to divert traffic. He has
also put in extra security and more phones at the theaters. On
visits to local schools he reminds teens that they are potential
mall employees as well as patrons.
   Malls have been havens for teen-agers almost from the beginning.
In fact mall owners took pains to attract them with movie theaters,
game rooms, record stores. The difference today is their sheer
numbers.
   Managers are trying innovations to attract teens. One offers
vacant space to a church group, which has set up drop-in
counseling. Another features fashion shows with high school
students as models.
   Says one manager, ``When I was a kid, I didn't have an American
Express card, but these kids do. They spend a lot of money here.''

   The Dalai Lama remains an exile from the land he
fled more than 30 years ago. His fight to free his people from
Chinese sway continues. A Nobel Peace Prize winner, his only weapon
is persuasion. But privately he wonders if there is any hope, or
whether there is any future for the role of a Dalai Lama.

   There is something incongruous in the scene - the
Dalai Lama seated robed and cross-legged on a baby blue upholstered
easy chair in the Royal Suite of Toronto's Royal York Hotel where
reproductions of 18th century European paintings gather dust on the
walls.
   But then, there is also something incongruous about a Buddhist
monk leading 6 million Tibetans in a struggle for
self-determination in their Himalayan homeland, using kindness as
his only weapon against the ruling Chinese.
   He warmly grasps the hand of his interviewer in both of his,
smiling, frequently laughing. He makes self-deprecating jokes or
tells humorous stories of his childhood.
   Obligatorily, he speaks about Chinese politics and violations of
human rights in the land he fled in 1959 after an abortive
uprising, a land Tibetans say is an independent country under
occupation and Beijing says is an integral part of China.
   But his eyes light up, his whole being comes alive when the
subjet changes to peace, to kindness, to human nature, to a world
without violence.
   Some of the restless youths who live at his headquarters in
exile at Dharmsala, India, sometimes grow impatient with his
methods.
   ``I always tell them my reasons,'' he says softly, sipping tea.
``Firstly, violence is against human nature. Then, secondly,
through violence, although you may achieve something, you may solve
some problem, violence always creates a second problem. It may be
useful, but the side effect is immense. Then, in our case, if we
follow a more violent nature, we may lose many good supporters.''
   Peace?
   What that means depends very much on your definition of the
word, says the winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. On one level,
peace may be simply the absence of violence. On another, he says
after considerable reflection, it is the absence of fear.
   ``Since the second world war, during the Cold War, there has
been some kind of peace,'' says the maroon- and saffron-robed monk,
warming to his subject. ``But that peace was not a genuine peace.
That peace was something like the mere absence of war. Bascially,
that kind of peace comes from fear.
   ``Now, today, I think peace is a genuine peace without fear,
genuine in the sense of cooperation, or the sense of some kind of
security, and working together. That's not the mere absence of war.
That's much more positive, much more conceptive.
   ``Now that (kind of) peace, I have always believed, comes
through mental peace, so first peace must be created here, in our
minds,'' he says, tapping the sparse, short bristles on his head.
``Then as a reflection of that inner peace, peace atmosphere in the
family, peace atmosphere in the community, in the country and on an
international level.''
   The Dalai Lama was born Lhamo Dhondrub on July 6, 1935 in a
small village in northeastern Tibet. At the age of 2, he was, in
accordance with tradition, found by a search party of monks and
after a series of tests recognized as the reincarnation of his
predecessor, the 13th Dalai Lama. He was renamed Jetsun Jamphel
Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, Holy Lord, Gentle Glory,
Eloquent, Compassionate, Learned Defender of the Faith, Ocean of
Wisdom.

   In 1950, the Chinese Communists attacked and occupied Tibet,
forcing the young Dalai Lama to step forward and attempt to deal
with Peking. Nine years later, he fled over the mountains on a yak
to India, setting up in exile.
   Much to the dismay of many of his followers, he is not convinced
the Dalai Lama, an institution created 600 years ago, has much of a
future.
   ``Some people get the impression that the Dalai Lama institution
is an essential element of Buddhism. It is not,'' he says, leaning
forward, peering seriously through his tinted glasses. ``Buddhism
flourished in Tibet much earlier than the Dalai Lama institution.
And also, some people get the idea that the Dalai Lama is something
of a symbol for Tibet and without the Dalai Lama Tibet no longer
exists or something. That is foolish.''
   He says that he is ''just a Buddhist monk, although he readily
admits that he is a unifying force for Tibetans.
   ``But this does not mean that the institution should always
remain. It entirely depends on the wishes of the Tibetan people. If
they feel the institution should be kept, then it will remain. If
the majority of the people feel it doesn't matter, then the
institution will cease. In that case, I will be the last Dalai
Lama.''
   Such talk makes many of his followers nervous. He laughs at
their nervousness.
   Over 10 years between 1978 and 1988, there were a series of
communications between the Dalai Lama and the authorities in
Beijing, but according to the Tibetan leader, they were only
interested in his return. They said he could come back to Tibet
with all previous rights and privileges.
   ``I told them that this is not the case, the problem is 6
million people. It's their rights and their culture. And unless
that basic problem is solved, the question of my return is
meaningless.''
   The Chinese, it seems, have an important sensory organ missing,
he says with a belly laugh that echoes across the large sitting
room of the hotel suite.
   ``That is the ear. They always lecture us. Always lecture,
lecture, lecture. They never listen to our viewpoint. I think the
world community now has to help with some aesthetic surgery to give
them some new ears,'' he says, rocking back again with laughter.
   His peace proposals, first made public in 1987, and refined in
1988, call for less than total independence for Tibet, leaving
defense and foreign affairs to the Chinese and all other matters in
Tibetan hands. It also would allow a limited number of Chinese
troops in Tibet, a regional peace conference, then ``a zone of
peace with complete demilitarization.''
   ``We're still awaiting a response.''
   Much of Tibet's culture already has been destroyed by the
Chinese, says the Dalai Lama, and official policy is to dilute
Tibet in a sea of Chinese immigration. Time, he says, is running
out.
   ``If the present situation remains another 15 years, then there
is no hope. Then Tibetans become a very insignificant community in
their own land.''
   Nonetheless, he is persistently optimistic. The Beijing regime
is very old, he theorizes, and it's only a matter of time. Younger,
more reasonable Chinese leaders are on the way.
   ``The younger generation of Chinese, they themselves are
fighting for their rights, for their democracy, for their
freedom.''
   But he'd rather talk about love and compassion.
   ``I am always trying to promote compassion and good heart,'' he
says, the glow returning to his face. ``Not as a religious ideal,
but rather as a humanitarian idea. I believe that little children
are born free of any religion, free of any ideology, but not free
of compassion. So I believe that compassion and love is the basic
human quality.''
   ``Hatred is also a human quality, but not the dominant one. The
dominant force, in my mind, is compassion.''

   The ``Building of Tomorrow'' that Frank Lloyd
Wright built 69 years ago has survived the worst of man and nature.
But the great architect's legacy may meet its match in Tokyo's land
fever.
   Marked by the horizontal planes and simple wood and mortar of
Wright's ``Prairie style,'' the school sits cracked and leaking on
a green square of land encroached by high-rises and construction
cranes in one of Tokyo's busie  sections.
   The approximately 3,000 square-yard plot owned by Jiyu Gakuen,
or Freedom School, is worth at least $230 million dollars,
according to the school's president, Gyo Hani.
   That may prove to be an offer the school can't refuse.
   The controversy over Myonichikan, or ``Building of Tomorrow,''
points up more than just the dominance of assets over aesthetics in
Tokyo's constantly changing skyline, where few traditional
structures remain since the fire-bombing of World War II.
   Architectural landmarks are rare and legal protections weak in a
nation with a habit of rebuilding itself from fires, earthquakes
and war.
   In Japan, says Prof. Hiroyuki Suzuki of Tokyo University,
artistry bows to function. ``Generally speaking, Japanese love new
buildings.''
   Wright himself, the father of organic architecture, preached
that ``the building should be a natural circumstance of the land.''
But the fields and farmhouses amid which he built Myonichikan in
1921 are no longer there. Today the building is used as a center
for craft-making and other activities.
   Hani insists there is no plan to sell, but says financial
security is his first priority as head of Jiyu Gakuen, now a
25-acre campus about 10 miles north.
   Hani's cousin, Yuko Hani, is seeking to raise the estimated $2
million needed to save Myonichikan. Both are related to the
school's founders.
   ``If Japan is a great economic power, why doesn't it spend money
on preserving these cultural assets?'' said Yuko Hani. ``In that
sense we certainly can't call ourselves a civilized nation, can
we?''
   Wright, who died in 1959, designed the building while in Tokyo
to supervise the construction of his Imperial Hotel, which was
later razed. Along with a private home near Osaka, Myonichikan is
the only Wright building left in Japan.
   Edwin Reischauer, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan who died
this year, wrote that Myonichikan ``symbolized Japan's search in
the 1920s to become a liberal, innovative nation and a free
democratic society.''
   Gyo Hani says symbols are nice but with $230 million in land
underneath, ``we don't want to commit our posterity to giving up
important assets.''

   Building prisons is a booming business these
days as the nation's prison population swells. But take a look at
what modern prisons look like inside and out. They are taking on
the appearance of office buildings, and new designs cut in half the
number of guards needed to supervise them.

   The Baker-Miller shade of pink was supposed to
have a calming effect on inmates. It did, but not for long.
   ``It worked for about 15 minutes,'' said Ann Balazs, resident
color expert at L. Robert Kimball &amp; Associates, a Pennsylvania
design firm. ``After that, they went nuts.''
   Picking a wall paint may seem a trifle, but in the growing field
of prison design it's often the little things that count.
   Like where to put the exterior plate-glass windows now used to
let in more natural light. In rural settings, waist-high windows
work fine. Not so in urban areas, where inmates' temptation to moon
passersby proves irresistible.
   The Ebensburg, Pa., firm founded by Mrs. Balazs' father has
learned that lesson and countless others after 12 years designing
more than 30 correctional facilities, from federal prisons to
county jails. Executives say revenues have risen from $12 million
to $26 million in the last five years, and there's no sign of a
slowdown.
   That's because the country's inmate population continues to
grow. The number of people behind bars has ballooned from about
500,000 just 10 years ago to nearly 1.1 million, according to the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. And the National Council on Crime and
Delinquency predicts the figure could reach 2 million by 1995.
   Prisons and jails built today are a far cry from the ones
pictured in old Edward G. Robinson movies. Gone are the drab
corridors painted in government green or hospital white. Designers
are experimenting with blues, yellows and earth tones to soften the
look. Baker-Miller pink failed to make the grade because
researchers found its soothing effect only temporary. Given that
quality, Mrs. Balazs said it's ideal for holding pens.
   To make prisons and jails more livable, designers have included
such features as air conditioning, upholstery and carpeting.
Stainless-steel toilets - once used because they were all but
impossible to rip from the floor - are giving way to ceramic
fixtures, some of them with seats.
   Wardens often hold out such amenities as a carrot to inmates who
want to graduate to better living quarters within a facility.
   Even the exteriors have a different look. The bars, barbed wire
and blockhouse style of older facilities made them easy to
recognize. Modern prisons and jails are built to blend in with the
surrounding area.
   L. Robert Kimball's newest jail, the Hillsborough County
Correctional Facility in Manchester, N.H., looks more like an
office complex, complete with landscaping. Other facilities have
skylights, columns or floor-to-ceiling windows.
   Architects and wardens alike stress common sense rather than
aesthetics is prompting the changes. The overall design strategy
aims at reducing tensions and forestalling trouble.
   ``You used to have 100 inmates in a cellblock that was dark and
filthy and not fit to be lived in. That created a very volatile
situation,'' said Kevin Drinan, Hillsborough's director of
corrections.
   Drinan contends better living conditions make for better
inmates.
   ``Generally speaking, when you treat people like animals, they
act like animals,'' he said.
   Critics complain the softer style has scant effect on hardened
criminals. If anything, they fear it sends the wrong message.
   ``If prisons are cushy places, no one will mind going there,''
contends Edwin Delattre, who teaches applied ethics at Boston
University and recently wrote ``Character and Cops.''
   ``The purpose of prisons is to punish. It's unjust if they are
too comfortable,'' he said.
   Like other modern jails, Hillsborough is designed according to
the direct-supervision model approved by the National Institute of
Corrections. The building is divided into self-contained areas that
usually house 48 to 56 inmates. The inmates sleep, shower and dine
in those areas, whose cells are arranged around a large day room.
   ``In the old days, you used to take the inmates to the services.
Now, you take the services to the inmates,'' said Czaba Balazs, L.
Robert Kimball's chief architect and son-in-law to the firm's
founder and president.
   Because direct-supervision prisons require more space, Balazs
says they cost 10 percent to 15 percent more than traditional
facilities. But he contends they are less expensive in the long run
because their layout limits the movement of inmates and therefore
reduces by half the number of guards needed.
   Proponents of the direct-supervision models say safety is
another factor. Because inmates are always within view of their
guards, there are fewer fights, according to a study by the
National Institute of Corrections. And the safer the environment,
the less likely inmates will resort to vandalism or violence in the
hope of being separated from others.
   Moreover, guards in direct-supervision facilities are assigned
to the same areas and encouraged to work closely with inmates so
they can identify problems before they get out of hand.
   ``A great part of it depends on the ability of the corrections
officer not to be a tough guy but to be a good communicator,'' said
Hillsborough's Drinan. ``In many cases, all these inmates need is
someone who'll listen to them.''
   That hands-on approach combined with design changes can be an
effective defense against trouble, including uprisings and riots,
Balazs said.
   ``The environment can have a direct impact on the level of
stress. It's no different than you or I getting irritated because
of working conditions. But at least we have options,'' he said.
   ``It's viewed as coddling inmates, but it's really not. The
point is, if you make it too tough on them, they're going to make
it tough on you.''

   La Chanze is a young actress with an exotic name
and a dazzling smile who's lighting up the joyful Broadway musical,
``Once on This Island.''
   She plays the role of Ti Moune, a peasant girl on an island in
the French Antilles. The role requires her to go barefoot and to
spend a good deal of time on her knees. ``My feet get pretty beat
up,'' La Chanze tells an interviewer in her Booth Theater dressing
room after a matinee. ``And my knees! Let me put some cream on my
knees.
   ``It's the floor. When you're on your knees so much, there is
muscle to help me from endangering my knees but there's nothing you
can do about skin.''
   In the play, Ti Moune (the name means orphan), finds a rich
young man in his wrecked car, nurses him back to health and falls
in love with him. The man, Daniel, played by Jerry Dixon, is
enchanted with Ti Moune. But the call of his life among the rich -
and lighter skinned - pulls him away. The musical, based on the
novel ``My Love, My Love'' by Rosa Guy, got glowing reviews last
season at off-Broadway Playwrights Horizons and more raves when it
moved to Broadway Oct. 18.
   La Chanze feels she is a natural for the role of Ti Moune. ``I'm
dark skinned and I've always had to deal with the reality of
prejudice within and outside my own race,'' she says. In
preparation, she spent two weeks living with a family in rural
Jamaica. ``They explained the different beliefs they had and the
history they'd been told. It was amazing how similar it was to the
musical.
   ``What I do in the show may come across as innocence but it's
because I'm trying to portray the Christian faith I have. What
motivates Ti Moune is her faith and her love for Daniel.''
   Their story in ``Once on This Island'' is told in words, music
and dance, like a Caribbean fairy tale or fable. Characters include
Erzulie, goddess of love; Asaka, mother of the earth, and Papa Ge,
demon of death.
   La Chanze has one big dance number. ``I feel fortunate to work
with someone as brilliant as Graciela Daniele. She did the
choreography for my dance and she gave me a lot of room to do steps
I enjoyed from my own past experience.''
   La Chanze was born in St. Augustine, Fla., the oldest of six
girls and three boys. She grew up mainly in Bridgeport, Conn., but
moved around often.
   ``Dancing was my first love,'' she says. ``No matter which city
we moved to, my mom had me in something like Pollyann's School of
Twirling and Ballet.'' In New Haven, she studied African dance; at
Morgan State University in Balitmore, theater; at the Philadelphia
College of the Performing Arts, voice and dance.
   She auditioned in Philadelphia for the summer production of
``Uptown...It's Hot!'' ``When it came to New York,'' she says, ``I
had the fever so I stayed here. I was a chorus girl. Maurice Hines
was the director, choreographer and star. He heard me sing when one
of the female leads was out and he had something written in for me,
so I was featured after that.''
   She had auditioned for one Broadway show earlier, ``Bubbling
Brown Sugar,'' singing ``Hit Me with a Hot Note and Watch Me
Bounce'' from ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies.'' She says,
``It was my audition song for a very long time.''
   She also auditioned for the film ``Tap'' and was told she was
too young to play Gregory Hines' love interest.
   ``After I left `Uptown,' I went into the touring company of
`Dreamgirls' - Japan, Europe, Canada, the States. I was cover to
the leading woman and sang the parta lot on the road. This is my
first leading role where I originated the character.''
   She says that when she auditioned for ``Once on This Island'' at
an open call her attitude was philosophical. If she got it, fine,
if she didn't, it didn't matter.
   ``Then I got a callback and they gave me the script so I could
read one of the scenes. Then I had to have it. I studied with a
vocal coach and really worked on the material.''
   La Chanze doesn't tell her age ``because of the character in the
play. She used to be 16. Somewhere along the line they told me
she's 18.''
   La Chanze says she was christened with the customary three
names. She dropped her first name when she came to New York, her
last name after her appearance in ``Dreamgirls.'' It left her with
her middle name, La Chanze, which was her maternal grandmother's
given name. To those who do not know her first and last names she
chooses not to reveal them. She is simply La Chanze.
   ``Everybody liked it better except my father and my sister
Michelle, who wanted everybody to know we were sisters.''
   Her father, now living in Kodiak, Alaska, has surprised her by
taking up acting. ``He retired from the military in 1982 and got a
master's degree in business and started a Ph.D. in management. He
owns a computer software company.
   ``He called and told me he has the lead in `Master Harold... and
the Boys.' I had no idea my dad had any interest in acting. He is
going to visit me and bring me a tape. He wants to know what I
think of his work. He is 46. He has time to pursue an acting career
if he wants to. That's hysterical to me.''
   La Chanze has an apartment with her cat, P2-78. She left her
first cat, Polaris, with her boyfriend when she went on tour. She
came back to find he'd given Polaris to the ASPCA. He became an
instant ex-boyfriend.
   The next cat became P2. Somebody in ``Dreamgirls'' thought it
should be P2-78 so it was. Her current boyfriend loves P2-78.
   La Chanze's dressing table holds a crystal paperweight, an
opening night gift. She says, ``This represents so much to me. It's
from three of my closest friends. I'm Christian and it points
straight up and reflects the light. It'll always be with me.''

   In flawless English, Edward Woodward combines
bluster, bluff and brilliance while he cons his way to finding
killers in his new CBS series ``Over My Dead Body.''
   Woodward's character, Maxwell Beckett, is often pompous but also
a touch nervous that the fraud about his actual Scotland Yard
background will be discovered. But he continues the charade in
hopes that getting entwined in murder mysteries will revive the
inspiration of his writing career.
   Woodward previously spent four years in New York for ``The
Equalizer,'' a series that won him a devoted following. It inspired
the publication of a number of newsletters and turned Woodward, now
60 and white-haired, into an unlikely sex symbol.
   ``Thank God my wife has a sense of humor,'' he says. ``Me, too.
I thought it started as a bit of fun, then it got picked up by the
magazines. I must say it caused a great deal of mirth among my
friends in England.''
   The new mystery-comedy is on Friday nights prior to ``Dallas''
in the CBS lineup. Woodward has his character fully defined:
   ``Maxwell pretends that he was a Scotland Yard detective, but
actually he was in the criminal analysis department. It's a lie he
has to live with. When we meet him he's moved to America, running
out of mystery plots and in the middle of a messy divorce.
   ``He's irascible, short-fused, inclined to be pompous and
feeling guilty about conning people. But he does have a talent for
analyzing crime and what makes people tick. He has a terrible
writer's block, and it makes him a very prickly individual.''
   On the set, Woodward's Becket is trying to intimidate a woman
into giving him information about a murder. But he's halted in the
middle of his bullying by Jessica Lundy, his co-star.
   Woodward and Lundy are odd associates - far apart in age but
well-matched in using each other in hopes of advancing their
separate careers. She has the role of Nikki Page, a newspaper
obituary writer. He hopes she'll bring him fresh material, and she
sees him as her ticket to the big time.
   ``Over My Dead Body'' brings the British actor to Los Angeles
for his first dramatic work here. He won an Emmy in September as
host-narrator of the documentary series ``Remembering World War
II.''
   He says there are no similarities between Maxwell Beckett of
``Over My Dead Body'' and Robert McCall of ``The Equalizer.''
   ``Maxwell is a physical coward,'' he says. ``In every way he's
different, except that he does have a good analytical mind.''
   Woodward suffered a heart attack three years ago and was
reluctant to appear in another one-hour television series.
   ``I didn't want to do another series. I found the work
unbelievably hard,'' he says.
   But he consented to do ``Over My Dead Body'' because the series
would bring him home to England in two years.
   ``I've slowed down considerably,'' he says. ``I don't work
between shows.
   ``The main problem is that I have a 7-year-old daughter who was
in pre-school in New York, school in England and now Los Angeles.
It's a great experience for a child to move around, but when she
turns 9 I want her to have a consistent education.''
   Woodward negotiated a contract that the show will move to
England after the first two TV seasons. That will allow his
daughter, Emily Beth, to attend school there - while he and his
wife, Michele Dotrice, move back into their home in Cornwall. He
has three grown children by a previous marriage.
   ``If we're successful and move to Great Britain I'll twist arms
to shoot in Cornwall. But we'll probably stay around London. The
story will be that Maxwell moves back home and Nikki follows.''
   Woodward also keeps a home in London, where he was born.
   ``We were bombed three times,'' he says. ``My father was
convinced Hitler was personally looking for him. He was injured the
last time, and when he got out of the hospital we were evacuated to
Cornwall. I learned to love boating there. A month before we came
here I bought a 42-foot twin-screw motor yacht to cruise the coast,
France and the Channel Islands.''
   During his break between ``The Equalizer'' and his new series,
Woodward stayed busy playing Sherlock Holmes in England and making
``Mr. Johnson'' in Africa.
   The movie ``Mr. Johnson'' is due out in January. Like two of his
other films, ``Breaker Morant'' and ``King David,'' it was directed
by Bruce Beresford.
   ``The title character is a 17-year-old African,'' he says. ``I'm
Sgt. Gollup, who runs a shop in Nigeria in 1926. Mr. Johnson is his
clerk. He was left behind by the British Empire and retires in
Nigeria. He's a most astonishing bigot. He thinks he's a great
gentleman to the African.''
   While in school, Woodward had planned to become a journalist,
but participation in a series of college productions changed his
mind. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his
stage debut in London, then joined the Royal Shakespeare Theatre
Co. in Stratford-On-Avon. He also performed Shakespeare on tours of
India, Australia, South Africa and the Soviet Union.
   ``The Russians know the plays, but it's interesting to watch the
audience hearing Shakespeare in its native tongue for the first
time. Shakespeare is played quite differently in Russia. We had
three Americans in the company and they were absolutely mobbed by
the audience. They were starved for contact with Americans. We
Brits said the Americans and the Russians were alike. They each
have a passion for their country, love outdoor pursuits and have an
enormous involvement with the arts.''

   The most delectable movie of the holiday season
is a simple little confection from John Hughes about a 10-year-old
who's left behind by accident when his parents and multitude of
siblings head off for a Christmas vacation in Paris.
   ``Home Alone'' is endearing, engaging and a lot of fun, once you
suspend disbelief and buy into Hughes' idiotic premise. And one
main reason for the film's success is Macaulay Culkin, the talented
young actor who plays Kevin, the boy who finds paradise in being at
home by himself and who gets to defend the castle against all
intruders.
   Child-centered movies are popular with the younger set because
they appeal to a sense of adventure, wonderment and just plain
getting away from grown-ups. They also find an audience in those
adults who are still fortunate enough to have a streak of whimsy in
their lives.
   Some young actors put in such grand performances that the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored them with Oscar
nominations. Only one, Tatum O'Neal ever won, as supporting actress
in ``Paper Moon'' in 1973. She was 10.
   Nominees have included: Jackie Cooper, actor (``Skippy''), 1931;
Jodie Foster, supporting actress (``Taxi Driver''), 1976; Quinn
Cummings, supporting actress (``Goodbye Girl''), 1977; Justin
Henry, supporting actor (``Kramer vs. Kramer''), 1979.
   Many child-centered movies have made it to video. Here's an
alphabetical list of some of what's available:
   - ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' (1938): Good Mark Twain fun.
   - ``The Bad News Bears'' (1976): A bunch of foul-mouthed Little
Leaguers. The best of the series. The sequels are bad news.
   - ``The Bicycle Thief'' (1949): Classic Italian drama about a
man whose livelihood is threatened when a thief steals his bicycle,
and the relationship he has with his son.
   - ``Black Beauty'' (1946): A little girl searches for her black
colt. Will definitely bring a tear or two.
   - ``The Black Stallion'' (1979): Wonderful movie treatment of
children's story about boy stranded on an island with a wild, black
horse.
   - ``Bugsy Malone'' (1976): Look Ma, no grown-ups. Entire cast of
kids, starring Jodie Foster, in 1920s send-up.
   - ``Captains Courageous'' (1937): A spoiled rich kid learns
about friendship and life. Stars Spencer Tracey, Lionel Barrymore
and Freddie Bartholomew.
   - ``A Christmas Story'' (1983): Jean Shepard's marvelous memory
of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red
Ryder air rifle.
   - ``Cinema Paradiso'' (1989): Oscar winner for best foreign
film. Concerns the friendship between a little boy and a film
projectionist in a small Italian city.
   - ``David Copperfield'' (1935): Find a children's movie in the
1930s and you find Freddie Bartholomew. He's a marvel in this grand
adaptation of Dickens' grand novel. All-star cast includes W.C.
Fields, Edna May Oliver and Basil Rathbone.
   - ``Empire of the Sun'' (1987): A Steven Spielberg epic that
loses its poignancy to Spielberg glitz. Based on J.G. Ballard's
autobiographical tale of his boyhood experience in a Japanese
prison camp during World War II.
   - ``E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial'' (1982): Another Spielberg
yarn. This time, a young boy takes an alien under his wing.
   - ``Fanny and Alexander'' (1983): The adventures of two children
in Sweden at the turn of the century. Ingmar Bergman at his best.
   - ``The Fallen Idol'' (1948): A young boy becomes disillusioned
with the family butler (Ralph Richardson).
   - ``The 400 Blows'' (1959): Francois Truffaut's powerful and sad
story of a boy's glimpse of reality.
   - ``The Goonies'' (1985): Some soon-to-be-evicted kids search
for hidden teasure and get a spooky adventure in the process.
   - ``Great Expectations'' (1946): An excellent film version of
the Dicken classic about an orphan and his mysterious benefactor.
Stars John Mills, Alec Guinness and Valerie Hobson.
   - ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989): What happens when
Murphy's Law meets Daddy the Inventor. Great family fun.
   - ``Hope and Glory'' (1987): Filmmaker John Boorman's childhood
experiences in London during the blitz.
   - ``The Journey of Natty Gann'' (1985): A street kid rides the
rails.
   - ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979): Robert Benton's Oscar-winning
movie about child custody.
   - ``Mary Poppins'' (1964):
``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'' And don't forget the
dancing penguins.
   - ``Miracle on 34th Street'' (1947): Do you believe in Santa
Claus? A delightful tale, starring Natalie Wood.
   - ``My Life as a Dog'' (1987): A charming import from Sweden
about a boy's first love.
   - ``National Velvet'' (1944): Elizabeth Taylor, young and
innocent, quiet, pretty and intense. With Mickey Rooney and a fine
horse.
   - ``Paper Moon'' (1973): A con man and his con kid in a
delightful story, starring Tatum O'Neal and Ryan O'Neal.
   - ``Pelle the Conquereor'' (1988): Hard times in Denmark,
starring Max von Sydow and Pelle Hvenegaard.
   - ``Poltergeist'' (1982): What happens when your little girl
watches too much television.
   - ``The Prince and the Pauper'' (1937): Mark Twain's classic
about mistaken identity. Stars Billy and Bobby Mauch as young
prince of England and a street urchin, and Errol Flynn. Remake in
1978 stars Charlton Heston, George C. Scott and Mark Lester. Both
are worthy.
   - ``Prancer'' (1989): A little girl believes she has discovered
one of Santa's reindeer and fights to protect it.
   - ``The Red Balloon'' (1966): Only 34 minutes of film, but an
engaging and warm parable.
   - ``Salaam Bombay'' (1988): Powerful glimpse of street children
in India.
   - ``Savannah Smiles'' (1982): A 6-year-old runaway teaches a few
hoods a thing or two.
   - ``Sounder'' (1972): A sharecropper and his family. Poignant
and well acted by Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield and Kevin Hooks.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``Tom Brown's School Days'' (1950): Life at a boy's school in
Victorian England.
   - ``Treasure Island'' (1934, 1950, 1990): All three versions of
Robert Louis Stevenson's story about a boy's experience with
pirates have merit and good casts. Take your pick among Jackie
Cooper, Bobby Driscoll and Christian Bale as the kid.
   - ``Uncle Buck'' (1989): U.B. is in a class all his own. So are
the antics of his neices and nephew. Great fun from John Hughes,
starring John Candy.
   - ``Whistle Down the Wind'' (1961): Three children find a
murderer and think he's Jesus Christ. A lovely look at innocence
and trust.
   - ``Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971): What
happens to bad, selfish brats and one nice little kid when they all
visit a candy baron's factory.
   - ``Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Judy and Co. What more can we say?
Oh, yeah - and Toto, too.
   - ``The World of Henry Orient'' (1964): Peter Sellers as
lecherous pianist idolized by two adolescent girls.
   - ``The Yearling'' (1946): A boy and his fawn.
   - ``Young Sherlock Holmes'' (1985): Spielberg ran out of tricks
for this one. Somewhat disappointing, but engaging performances by
Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox as Holmes and Watson as youngsters.

   ``Vol. 3'' (Wilbury) - Traveling Wilburys
   
   The music world's a big joke to the Traveling Wilburys, whose
new disc only sounds like it was written and recorded in an
afternoon. Don't be fooled. Pride being what it is, this low-key
supergroup has made a first-rate followup to their surprise 1988
hit.
   For all the wink-wink, nudge-nudge antics, the Wilburys are
quite serious when it comes to music. In fact, with the exception
of Tom Petty, whose solo career is still at its peak - it might
behoove George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne to become
full-time Wilburys.
   That would allow Dylan and Harrison to indulge their senses of
humor without worrying about their considerable recorded legacies.
Harrison manages to fit the cliche twister, ``she's got a body for
business and a head for sin'' into the garage rocker ``She's My
Baby.'' Dylan gets the racy line, ``she likes to stick her tongue
right down my throat,'' into the same song.
   The Wilburys don't credit songwriters individually, but it's
clear Dylan's contributions loom large. Seemingly offhand songs
such as ``If You Belonged to Me'' and the doo-wop style ``Seven
Deadly Sins'' are better than anything on his most recent solo
album.
   Harrison's instrumental work is superb, particularly his rocking
sitar on the environmentalist ``The Devil's Been Busy,'' and the
warped guitar sound on Petty's country romp, ``Poorhouse.''
   Lynne, as his recent solo album inadvertently proved, is better
suited now as a role player. He plays the widest variety of
instruments and his production with Harrison, despite the
occasional annoying chirpy background vocals, is fine.
   ``You Took My Breath Away'' is a worthy tribute to late Wilbury
Roy Orbison and the hilarious ``Wilbury Twist,'' a dance anthem for
cynical baby boomers, brings this disc to a rocking close.
   The Wilburys sound like they may be suited to this business. And
that's no joke.

   ``Uptown'' (Telarc) - Andre Previn with Mundell Lowe and Ray
Brown
   
   Great musicians moving into waters that are not really their
element often produce tepid ripples of mediocrity.
   Composer-conductor Andre Previn can adeptly put pen to musical
score and ably draw the beauty of Mozart out of a symphony
orchestra with the wave of a baton. But can he swing? Can he play
to the grayness of an autumn day and the melancholy mood of
``Stormy Weather?''
   Better to ask where Previn's talents stop, for the answer to the
above is yes.
   Previn on piano, Mundell Lowe on guitar and Ray Brown on bass
form as fine a straight-ahead jazz trio as any in recent memory.
Most of the songs on ``Uptown'' are by Harold Arlen or Duke
Ellington, and this trio gets to the essence of the music.
   Any trio has to have a solid backbeat to drive the sound, and
Brown is the launch pad for Previn and Lowe. His backing is so
solid that both have the freedom to wander as moved. They never
wander too far afield, however, and that gives this record a
friendly feel. The mood is bright, playful. Previn to Lowe and
back, the solos flow.
   Lowe's caress is soft, but his sound is full. Previn is right on
target with the mood of each song, quick to jump on ``It Don't Mean
a Thing If You Ain't Got That Swing'' or ``Five O'Clock Whistle,''
and slow to ponder on ``Stormy Weather'' or ``Come Sunday.''
   This is the second Telarc jazz recording with Previn; the first
featured Brown and guitarist Joe Pass. There's little doubt Previn
will ever need to make a living at jazz, but this accomplished
musician definitely has a home ``Uptown.''

   Gerard Depardieu is late. He walks quickly into
the hotel lobby, apologizes for the delay and hurries off to make a
phone call and ditch his suit.
   A few minutes later, the French actor is seated in a nearly
empty restaurant, wearing clothes more to his liking: jeans,
T-shirt and a denim windbreaker - all black. His sneakers are
white.
   Depardieu is 6-foot-2, heavy in the torso and light on his feet,
like a dancing bear. He has a mustache and straight, dark-blond
hair that sweeps across his forehead. His eyes are childlike,
sensitive, and his nose is thick, though no match for the one he
wears in the title role of his new film, ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   An adaptation of Edmond Rostand's classic love story, ``Cyrano''
begins at a French theater in 1640. Here, too, Depardieu (as
Cyrano) is late. The play has already started when a voice is heard
shouting, ``King of clowns! Leave the stage - at once!''
   Cyrano emerges, pushing his way through the crowd, his long hair
and great nose unmistakable. He shouts down the hapless actor on
stage and shuts down the performance.
   ``I've had dreams like that. Bad dreams,'' laughs Depardieu,
speaking mostly in English, but keeping a translator on hand. ``I
always dream that I am on the stage and Iforget my lines and I
start sweeping the floors. I like characters who go too far. In
`Cyrano,' what he does is very strong. This man stops the play and
puts the character in the street. That's extraordinaire!
Encroyable!''
   Depardieu was born in 1948 in Chateaureux, part of the region of
central France known as the Berri. The third of six children, he
was a petty thief at age 8, a dropout at 12 and a runaway at 13. A
pyschologist urged him to take drama classes. His first movie came
out in 1965, his second six years later.
   More than 60 have followed, the breakthrough film called,
fittingly, ``Going Places'' (``Les Valseuses'').
   ``Nothing has changed,'' insists Depardieu, who lives near Paris
with his wife and two children. ``When I was 12 years old, 8 years
old, I was exactly the same way as now. I was always functioning
very fast.
   ``I always wanted to be an actor. I loved the movies. I went to
the cinema when I was young and it was magic. I loved going into
the theater and sitting in the dark. I would see French `B' movies,
also American movies.''
   His life on screen has been varied: an imposter in ``Le Retour
de Martin Guerre'' (``The Return of Martin Guerre''), a bisexual
thief in ``Menage,'' a hunchback in ``Jean de Florette,'' an evil
traveling salesman in ``Nathalie Granger.'' He was guillotined in
``Danton,'' murdered in ``Barocco'' and emasculated in ``La
Derniere Femme'' (``The Last Woman'').
   Awards for best actor include the Cesar, the French equivalent
to the Academy Award, in 1981 for ``Le Dernier Metro'' (``The Last
Metro''); a citation from the National Society of Film Critics in
1984 for ``Danton'' and ``Martin Guerre,'' and honors at the Cannes
Film Festival last summer for ``Cyrano.''
   ``I'm not interested in people who are happy and everything is
great - someone who smiles and is an idiot, who thinks everything's
beautiful,'' Depardieu explains, stretching his mouth into a
mock-silly grin. ``The most difficult thing is to play a man who is
not a gangster or a romantic, who is nothing.''
   His voice is a breathless purr at his most intimate moments. It
is high-pitched and excitable when he's making a point, and a
hoarse bellow whew he's passionate.
   Depardieu loves everything about films except sitting still, and
Cyrano, mighty with the pen and sword, is a man in motion, talking
and fighting, pouring his heart out to the beautiful Roxane but
putting the words in the mouth of another man.
   ``When I was young, I was very introverted,'' Depardieu says.
``I didn't need to wear masks; I was a mask. ... I was very good at
training to be a boxer but as soon as the competition began I'd
lose my nerve. That didn't happen on stage.
   ``The way Cyrano speaks is magic. I wish I could speak in verse,
like he does. All the words he says came directly from the soul.
When you're transported by love, you're in a state of grace. It was
an easy part to play because I believed in the words of Cyrano.''
   Depardieu prepares to leave, making a telephone call, and going
through a quick photo session. When he says goodbye, one large hand
grips tightly while the three inside fingers from his other hand
rest gently above the wrist. It's a bond, a mark until next time.
You want to roll up your sleeve and check for imprints.
   ``I carry my adornments on my soul,'' Cyrano says. ``I do not
dress up like a popinjay; but inwardly, I keep my daintiness.'' The
actor speaks of his character as a ``tornado,'' a man in love with
melodrama who ``expends his energy and feelings without a second
thought.''
   ``I'm quite like him in this respect,'' Depardieu notes.
   And then he turns and rushes off, headed for his next
appointment, trying not to be late.

<HEAD>The Artists: Lighting and Set Designer Makes Directing Debut</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Seattle Opera general director Speight
Jenkins decided to produce Antonin Dvorak's ``Rusalka,'' he knew
whom he wanted as lighting and set designer: Gunther
Schneider-Siemssen.
   There was just one hitch.
   ``He said, `I won't come unless I am the director,''' Jenkins
said.
   Saying yes meant giving Schneider-Siemssen what is normally the
work of three people in his U.S. debut as an opera stage director.
   For 27 years he was the chief lighting and set designer for the
late Berlin Philharmonic conductor Herbert von Karajan. His seven
production designs for ``Der Ring des Niebelungen'' were the most
by anyone since Richard Wagner compleeed the four-part operatic
extravaganza in 1874.
   Yet his only directing had been in the relative obscurity of
South Africa.
   ``It was a gamble ... a total shot in the dark with one of the
most famous people in the business,'' Jenkins said.
   The gamble paid off in a shimmering joint production by the
Seattle Opera and Houston Grand Opera, which is expected to present
``Rusalka'' in its next season. Seattle performances were Oct.
27-Nov. 7.
   Unlike the movie based on the same Hans Christian Andersen fairy
tale, ``The Little Mermaid,'' the opera ends with the death of the
prince and the confinement of Rusalka to the dark marshes because
she has been tainted by contact with humans.
   ``On the one hand, I want to bring out the characters, and on
the other hand I want to bring out the symbolic and the
metaphysical traits,'' Schneider-Siemssen said.
   ``For example, the chorus in `Rusalka' represents a decadent
party in the castle. The one has Parkinson's disease, the other is
limping, a third has a pain in the back. ...
   ``The princess and the dukes and Rusalka are human creatures in
contrast to the stiff party.''
   Slides hand-painted by Schneider-Siemssen were projected to form
the prince's castle, which loomed forebodingly over a stone bridge
and moat, and the sky over Rusalka's lake, lined by trees that seem
to filter an ethereal moonlight and luminescent sunshine.
Spotlights shining through vertical plastic sheets gave the effect
of rippling water.
   Schneider-Siemssen said his goal was always that ``when the
curtain opens, you don't only hear the music, you see the music.''
   Giving music a visible dimension became his life's work at age
14, he said.
   Unable to decide between scenery painting and conducting, he
went to Clemens Krauss, then general director of the State Opera in
Vienna.
   ``He said, `Don't become a conductor. In the future, we need
designers who are able to interpret music optically,'''
Schneider-Siemssen recalled.
   During World War II, he studied scenic painting, theater and
related subjects at Munich. His first set design was for a small
comedy called ``Angelica.'' For budget reasons he borrowed the
furniture from the parlor of his parents' apartment, which soon
afterward was bombed in an Allied raid.
   ``I saved that furniture from the American bombs,'' he said.
``When my parents went to opening night and the curtain opened,
they were shocked to see their living room on stage.''
   In his first stage contract, at the Landes Theater in Salzburg,
money shortages in war-ravaged Europe led him to begin his
pioneering use of slides to meld lighting into the set.
   In 1956, working in Bremen, Germany, he learned that von Karajan
had admired his work on a production of Beethoven's ``Fidelio.''
   A year and a half later, Schneider-Siemssen arranged an
introduction to von Karajan in Salzburg, but it was only in 1962
that their long collaboration began.
   That year, after laboring over a design proposal for ``Pelleas
et Melisande,'' he went to Vienna and found the stage hands were on
strike, leaving too little time for set construction.
   ``So I said to Karajan, `You know, let's not do all this. Let's
do it all with light and projections.'
   ``That gave him the time to do the show,'' Schneider-Siemssen
said. ``This was one of the most beautiful productions of
Karajan.''
   Schneider-Siemssen's first stint as a director was on ``Tristan
und Isolde'' in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1983. He later directed
``The Flying Dutchman'' in 1985, ``Die Zauberflote'' in 1985 and
``Fidelio'' this year at Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria and
Bloemfontein.
   ``Of course, the `Fidelio' and the concept of freedom has very
much meaning in South Africa,'' he said. ``I have, in the opera
house, no apartheid. I have black people and white people in the
stage crew, lighting and chorus.''
   Today, negotiating for contracts in Austria and Germany, he said
he probably should have begun directing 15 years ago.
   ``I take certain works that are very much of interest to me and
that are everything,'' he said. ``I was so busy with the research
for the stage and the lighting, I just didn't have the time.''
   He spends about seven months a year with his wife, an American,
and their four children in a Vienna home where he has his design
studio; two months at a summer home in Salzburg for the annual
musical festival; and much of the rest of the time at an apartment
in New York.
   ``I fear I have a double marriage,'' he said, ``with stage
design, and with my wife.''

   Daryl Hall and John Oates, those enduring
peddlers of blue-eyed soul, have given up sex and dancing in favor
of sweetness and sincerity.
   On their new album, anyway.
   ``Change of Season,'' on the Arista label, is a rebellion
against the 1980s and all the decade symbolized, the two said in an
interview in their manager's office.
   The '80s were ``high-tech and high flying, go-go years of
getting out there and being aggressive. I thought it was time for a
little more sweetness and coming together, bringing out our
sensitive side,'' Hall said.
   ``Ooh Yeah!,'' the duo's last album in 1988, ``was about late
'80s kind of things - sex and dancing. This is the opposite of
that,'' he said.
   The new album ``is about change and how people react to change.
The unifying lyrical focus is the idea that change occurs and how
people react to it resist it, go with it. ...
   ``I don't look back. I just go,'' Hall said. ``I move straight
through things - not without some difficulties occasionally.''
   ``I look forward to change,'' said Oates. ``I see things moving,
whether they move forward or backward.''
   Accompanying the softer image is a softer sound.
   ``We did a series of unplugged (acoustic) shows last spring,''
Hall said. ``You can play good rock 'n' roll on mandolins. It felt
so good we decided to expand on it.'' They'll probably do some of
the set acoustically in their upcoming tour. The final track on
``Change of Season'' is the acoustic ``So Close (Unplugged).''
   Despite the duo's newly sweet image, the tour will included a
lot of that tainted '80s stuff: ``Sra Smile,'' ``Rich Girl,''
``Private Eyes,'' ``Maneater,'' ``Kiss on my List'' and ``I Can't
Go for That.'' The tour will begin in Europe, but Hall and Oates
expect to spend most of next year performing in the United States.
   In concerts this year, they've been performing ``Can't Help
Falling in Love With You,'' which they did on ``The Last Temptation
of Elvis,'' an album of Elvis Presley hits performed by various
artists to benefit the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Trust.
   Most of ``Change of Season'' was recorded in a studio Hall and
Oates built in upstate New York. ``It's equal distance between our
two homes an hour and a half north of New York City,'' said Oates,
who is married and has no children. Hall has a longtime girlfriend.
   ``It's the first time in over a decade we haven't recorded in
New York City,'' Hall says. ``That's another factor in the music.
It is not about urban subjects and the sound is not urban. It's a
big change for us.
   ``We didn't try for any one audience with this. We were writing
from inside.''
   The first single to be released off the new album is ``So
Close,'' produced by Danny Kortchmar and Jon Bon Jovi in Los
Angeles.
   ``George Green sent me some lyrics,'' Hall said. ``I adopted the
moral and changed the words around a bit. It's about people who
started wrong and stay wrong. It's not a pretty story.''
   Hall and Oates have been playing for nearly two decades. Their
first album came out in 1972; the first they produced themselves
was 1980's ``Voices.''
   That album ``is the standard we judge ourselves from,'' Hall
said. ``It's similar to this album in its purity and simplicity.
   None of the songs on ``Change of Season'' is written by Hall and
Oates together. ``Our apartness is part of our togetherness,'' Hall
said. ``We do solo projects or bring in other writers.
   ``We have telepathic communication. We can do different things
and be apart, like we were in 1986, and come back and have taken
the same steps and really be thinking the same way.''
   ``I think in the process of making music we both kind of know
right and wrong for us,'' said Oates.

<TEXT>
   T. Coraghessan Boyle was between acts, just
finished with an appearance on ``Late Night With David Letterman''
and getting ready for a reading at Columbia University.
   A born performer, he fit right in on Letterman, telling jokes
about his middle name, crocodiles in Georgia and unsavory food in
Japan. The host played it straight and let his guest steal the
show.
   Letterman isn't known for trading barbs with men of letters -
imagine one-liners with John Updike about ``Rabbit at Rest'' or
Gabriel Garcia Marquez on ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' So how
did Boyle end up sitting beside him?
   His appearance is one reason. Boyle doesn't look like a writer.
He stands 6-foot-3, his skinny frame covered by a dark gray suit
with white speckles and anchored by red high-top sneakers. He has
kinky hair, the color of bruised apricots, and a matching beard.
   And the cover boy of The New York Times book review section
doesn't act like a writer, certainly not the kind who spends hours
brooding about the future of minimalist novels or the crisis of
middle-class relationships in the late 20th century.
   Just call him, in the Letterman spirit, ``The World's Most
Dangerous Author.''
   ``I came up from nowhere, looking at TV all day long and
thinking writers were snobs,'' Boyle explained in an interview at
Manhattan's Algonquin Hotel, where brooding authors are known to
congregate. ``But I have the credentials. I have the Ph.D. I have
books on the front page of The New York Times.
   ``I think some writers who don't have the credentials have to
prove themselves by acting stuffy. Maybe I've been lucky. I've
never been part of the club and I never will and I have no problem
with that.''
   Seven books and the PEN-Faulkner Prize for fiction in 1988 have
settled him only slightly. Boyle is a hard man to pin down. He's a
fabulist, a personality, the slippery ``I'' in a hurricane of
literary adventures.
   Read his short stories, ``If the River Was Whisky'' and ``Greasy
Lake,'' or his new novel, ``East Is East'' (Viking, $19.95), and
you'll find apes, chefs, musicians and the wife of Nikita
Khrushchev; the author is distinctly off the pages.
   None of the characters in ``East Is East'' is based on people he
knows. He's never lived in any of the locations. The plot came from
a newspaper article he lost long ago.
   What does T. Coraghessan Boyle, recovered addict of the small
screen and other vices, have to do with this wacky tale of Hiro the
Japanese sailor, who jumps ship along the coast of Georgia and
dodges immigration officials in the Okefenokee Swamp?
   ``My joke is I wrote a novel about Georgia because I had flown
over Georgia several times on my way to Miami. It's easier to write
the book if you've seen the place but I don't have to go there like
James Michener and dig in. I think fiction is supposed to be an
exercise of the imagination. My take is I can do anything I want.''
   He was born 42 years ago, his idea of nowhere the town of
Peekskill, N.Y., the childhood setting for the author and his
television set. The transformation from Tom Boyle, couch potato and
daydreamer, to author T. Coraghessan Boyle (the middle name an
early work of fiction) began at a creative writing class in
college.
   Boyle calls himself a ``virgin'' to writers' colonies, but he
did spend five years at a den of iniquity known as the Iowa Writers
Workshop, where Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving, Flannery O'Connor and
many others came of age.
   Boyle expresses his feelings about the company of his peers in
``East Is East,'' which features a colony swarming with pesky
authors:
   ---
   ``At breakfast, it was thought, artists of a certain temperament
required an absolute and meditative silence, broken only perhaps by
the discreet tap of a demitasse spoon on the rim of a saucer - in
order to make a fruitful transition from the realm of dreams to
that exalted state in which the deep stuff of aesthetic response
rises to the surface.
   ``Others, of course, needed just the opposite - conviviality,
uproar, crippling gossip, lame jokes and a whiff of the sour
morning breath of their fellow artists - to settle brains fevered
by dreams of grandeur, conquest and utter annihiliation of their
enemies.''
   ---
   ``Of course, I was Olympian and far above all that pettiness,''
Boyle, speaking of his days at Iowa, said with a laugh. ``I know
how it feels and I think that's where I'm getting some of my
inspiration. I didn't do any politicking and I got everything I
wanted from pure virtue, like Mahatma Gandhi.''
   ``Descent of Man,'' a collection of stories written for his Ph.D
at Iowa, was published in 1979. He followed that with more stories,
``Greasy Lake,'' and a pair of novels, ``Budding Prospects'' and
``Water Music.'' The historical novel ``World's End,'' set in the
New York town of ``Peterskill,'' won him the PEN-Faulkner award.
   For the Columbia reading, Boyle keeps the sneakers and dons a
snappy black jacket. This audience will have read his books, but
for the author it's still a performance. Boyle sees himself as a
crossover artist, straddling talk shows and the Ivy League.
   ``I do believe the way everything is constructed with television
and personality, writers have to go out and grab hold of the
attention in some way,'' Boyle said.
   ``I think I wonder where I fit in exactly, but as far as being
on the front page of The New York Times and also be on `David
Letterman,' I have no problems with that. I think in this society
you have to try to catch and recapture the audience for literature.
That's a lot of energy spent for things outside of writing, and
that's bad.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Alison Krauss Chose Music Over Roller Derby</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alison Krauss chose music over roller
derby, and the result is a young, bluegrass fiddler-singer
shouldering her way into a male-dominated genre.
   The 19-year-old Krauss is one of just a few women recording the
acoustic, mountain-bred music. She's spent three years recording
with Rounder Records and has already made a concert tour of the
Middle East.
   But it wasn't that long ago, a few years in fact, that she had
to choose between bowing her fiddle or racing on roller skates.
   ``I was really into roller skating for a long time,'' Krauss
recalled in an interview in the office of her booking agent. ``I
used to go every Frday and Saturday night. I couldn't decide
whether to play the violin or roller skate.''
   She chose violin, and subsequently emerged as an independent and
gifted instrumentalist with a soprano voice reminiscent of a young
Dolly Parton or Emmylou Harris.
   Though still a teen-ager, she has firm views about bluegrass
music and what she will and won't do. Compromises aren't likely.
Although she has a recording contract with an independent label,
she's not ready to jump to a more prestigious major company.
   ``We want to play bluegrass music and if somebody signed us, it
would be totally something else,'' she said. Major labels today do
not sign bluegrass performers because the commercial market for
them is weak.
   ``They would hire a producer, and I'd want to be able to choose
somebody myself,'' Krauss said.
   ``Maybe I'll change my mind later, but really that's not
something I'm after right now. I'm playing with four great people
(her band, Union Station), and I want to keep doing that.''
   She also refuses to play such bluegrass standards as ``Orange
Blossom Special,'' ``Rocky Top'' and ``Fox on the Run.''
   ``Our goal is to play our own music,'' she said. ``Haven't
people heard those songs enough yet?''
   Some bluegrass fans might consider such a statement blasphemy.
Festival performers are routinely asked to play the standards made
famous by Bill Monroe, the Osborne Brothers and others.
   Krauss grew up in Champaign, Ill., and learned classical violin
at age 5. She gravitated to bluegrass music and started winning
bluegrass fiddle contests at age 12. Before she was a teen-ager,
she began playing at bluegrass festivals in the Midwest.
   Her current album is ``I've Got That Old Feeling,'' her third,
which contains songs focusing on romance and heartbreak. Her past
LPs were ``Two Highways'' in 1989 and ``Too Late to Cry'' in 1987.
   Since she was 10, she has spent much time performing in clubs,
places where she was not old enough to legally drink liquor.
   ``One time, when I was about 13, I was told to go into a room on
the break and told to stay there and not even see the bar,'' she
said. ``Nobody has ever gotten really rowdy. Sometimes somebody
will get really sloshed at the end of the show, but not often.''
   Late last year, she and her band spent a month in the Middle
East as part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by the U.S.
Information Agency. She gave concerts in Israel, Jordan, Pakistan,
Syria and Tunisia.
   ``Our music went over great,'' she said. ``It was a major moment
in our lives. We got to see places most people only think about.''
   She believes women are breaking into the bluegrass field, which
has never had a woman as an established star. ``There's beginning
to be singers, fiddlers, banjo players and all-female bands.
Bluegrass has been totally male-dominated. It's just something
women didn't do.''
   She said she's heard other women bluegrass musicians complain
about being unwelcome by their male counterparts. ``But I've never
had that feeling - that people didn't want me there because I was a
woman.''
   Her band - a banjo player, guitarist, mandolin player and bass
player - performs mostly at nightclubs and some folk festivals.
   ``The most exciting thing for me is to see people singing the
words to your songs while you stand on the stage,'' she said, ``and
when people request songs that you do and no one else does.''

   Karen Meredith has a message for all the
baby boomers whose parents told them to buy sensible cars, save
money and live within their means: Grow up. Mom and dad were right.
   Meredith, an accountant inspired to action by the woes of her
30-something clients, believes much of a generatiilt four-room cottage
that fits
in the back yard.
   Developer J. Robert Gillette says the cottages are America's
answer to Australia's ``granny flats.''
   The cottages, which can be hooked to untilities in the main
home, sell for about $50,000 or rent for $600 to $700 a month. The
relatives are nearby but not crowding the family.
   Gillette wants the first cottages to be built on the grounds of
senior citizens' complexes. Cottage occupants will have more
privacy, and pay less, than residents of the complex itself, but
still have easy access to social events, meals and services such as
laundry.
   Trial programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas and California
show that what the American Association of Retired People calls the
Elder Cottage Housing Opportunity an work.
   ``It's very cozy,'' Pauline Wessner, 85, said from the ECHO
cottage she's lived in for two years near Belvedere, N.J.
   Wessner's grandson thought of her when the county's Office on
Aging announced an ECHO trial program. He had bought the house
where she lived for nearly 40 years, and she had moved to an
apartment, she said. ``It was too much work for me to mow the grass
and everything else.''
   ``I live right next door to my grandson now, about 45 feet from
his house,'' she said.
   The county bought the cottage and leases it to her for an amount
based on her Social Security income. She has a bedroom, bathroom,
parlor and fully equipped kitchen.
   Probably not more than 100 of the little houses have been set up
nationally, said Leah Dobkin of the AARP in Washington. But the
AARP has published outlines for developers and local governments of
the zoning, parking and other issues the cottages raise.
   It's better than backing a trailer in, Dobkin said. ``These are
specially designed for the elderly, and they meet all housing
codes,'' she said.
   Gillette's cottage plans show ramps for people who don't want to
climb stairs, wide doors, bathtub rails, and kitchen sinks minus
the usual cabinets underneath that keep wheelchair users at arm's
length.
   Gillette said he'll erect four cottages at the American House
Dearborn Heights, Mich., complex by spring.
   That the cottages are detached is a key for senior citizens like
Wessner, who want to live near their families, but not in the same
house.
   ``That wouldn't go,'' Wessner said. ``They have two teen-agers,
who like loud music. Grandma's a little too old for that now.''
   But the cottage avoids the loneliness of long-distance living.
   ``My grandson stops in every morning with the newspaper for me.
They invite me over, which I appreciate. I go over there on Sunday
for coffee and a bun.''
   And on holidays, she said, ``We eat together. Unless I'm invited
somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Indian Aging Advocate Urges Return to Old Values</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The old values, from a time when
neighbors cared about one another and youngsters respected their
elders, must be resurrected or the future will hold little hope for
elderly Indians, an advocate says.
   Curtis Cook, executive director of the Albuquerque-based
National Indian Council on Aging Inc., said the growing ranks of
Indian elderly make that philosophy even more crucial.
   ``We're in the midst of an increase in elders and decreasing
resources,'' Cook said in a recent luncheon speech to the National
Congress of American Indians convention. ``Something has to
change.''
   The 199O census is expected to show an 83 percent increase in
the population of Indian elders since the last count taken a decade
ago, he said.
   ``There's no way that the '90s can have any kind of new
federalism or any kind of hope for the future of American Indian
elders'' unless the teachings and ways of the past are learned and
practiced, Cook said.
   Cook, a non-Indian who has worked with American Indians for more
than 25 years, urged changes in laws and policies and pressed for a
commitment among governments and youth to serve older people.
   Cook criticized the Indian Health Service and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development for what he called
policies that hurt elderly Indians.
   He said HUD will not build homes for Indians over 62, and in
some cases will allow only the nuclear family - not grandparents -
to live in houses built with federal money.
   That effectively abolished housing for Indian elderly at a time
when statistics show that 23.6 percent live at substandard levels,
he said.
   Cook said the IHS has no specialized geriatric care or research.
   He criticized the Social Security system for eliminating 17,000
field contact positions in rural areas and the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs for not establishing special programs for the
elderly.
   ``This great American society which prides itself on feeding the
needy throughout the world ... needs to learn a few things from
Indian society, which would say `We will not have enough, but you
are a guest here at this table and we will share,''' Cook said.
``This is the Indian term, this is the Indian way.''
   Cook said after his talk that society generally holds a
misconception that Indians have all their needs met by the federal
government. He said Indians, and especially the elderly, have the
highest rates of poverty of any ethnic group in the country.
   The NCAI is the oldest and largest Indian political organization
in the United States.

<HEAD>Feisty Bob Watts Still Up in the Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bob Watts has flown military cargo planes
to China and an orchestra to Canada. He's survived an emergency
landing in Bismarck and an unexpected plunge into the Missouri
River.
   He's ornery or kind, depending on whom you talk to.
   Watts, 73, owns Capital Aviation, with 10 small airplanes and
runs it with his wife, Lois.
   When he's not in the air, you can find Watts in his shop,
rebuilding a 1946 Cessna, along with his family - Lois, their
15-year-old dog Klondike and two cats.
   Klondike has logged more than 3,000 miles in the air. The cats,
Midway and Nuisance, have made a few flights by sneaking on board.
   Watts has flown supplies to the Garrison Dam and to an
earthquake scene in West Yellowstone. When conductor Guy Lombardo
and his orchestra found their plane had engine trouble, Watts got
them to Canada.
   ``I'll bet I've got shirts and socks in at least a dozen
laundromats all over the country from living out of a briefcase,''
he says. But he's had fun.
   ``I wouldn't want an airline job where I have to fly to
Minneapolis to Bismarck and back to Minneapolis and back to
Bismarck. I wouldn't do that for all the tea in China,'' he says.
   Watts was in China during World War II, airlifting military
supplies over ``The Hump,'' in the Himalaya Mountains to the Flying
Tigers, a group of mercenaries under the command of the United
States and its allies.
   ``On occasion, we had red-ball alerts and we had to go on radio
silence,'' he says. ``But the only thing we could really do was
head for the clouds, and there were plenty of those. You just keep
flying.
   ``We hauled tent stakes, ketchup, light bulbs, munitions. We
moved two cut-up locomotives over the Hump. Later, they were welded
back together.''
   After the war, he and his brother Jack started Capital Aviation
Corp. Jack Watts retired eight years ago. Lois Watts, a home
economics teacher for 29 years, became office manager and
bookkeeper in 1976.
   In 1982, Watts was piloting a plane carrying eight people when
the landing gear failed and he was forced to bring the plane down
in Bismarck on its belly. The landing was smooth; no one was hurt.
   In 1956, he and a photographer escaped injury when their light
plane went into the Missouri River.
   ``I wasn't watching where I was going,'' Watts recalls. ``I just
flew the plane into the water - just like the guy on the street,
turns his head to look at a pretty girl and hits a lamppost. I
learned to mind the road.''
   His biggest obstacle, he says, is the Federal Aviation
Administration, which is threatening to take away his license for
flying without the proper fuel adjustment valve. Watts and his
attorney are fighting the agency.
   ``If you don't dot all your i's and cross your t's you are
subject to severe penalties and fines,'' Watt says. ``People in
Washington seem to think a light plane is a rich man's fancy.''
   But people like Erwin Kobs of Bismarck, who did maintenance for
Watts in the 1950s, think he'll outlast the bureaucrats.
   ``He's a tough master,'' Kobs said. ``but he's a good pilot.
``Aviation is his life, there's no doubt about that. He's a
survivor.''

<HEAD>If You Plan Your Planting, You Can Eat Fresh Longer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Superior taste is the main reason for homegrown
vegetables. But identical varieties will ripen around the same time
unless the planting is spaced over several weeks. So successive
plantings are needed for a continuous, top-quality supply over the
longest possible period.
   For example, in this warm, arid climate, green onions for eating
(scallions) develop from onion sets in a few weeks. In late October
or early November, I prepare a 4-by-10-foot raised bed and divide
it into three equal segments. Sets spaced an inch apart are planted
in the first segment. Two weeks later a similar planting goes into
segment No. 2. Segment No. 3 is planted two weeks later.
   By the time the green onions from the first bed have been eaten
and replacement sets planted, the second bed is being harvested.
This sequence continues until higher temperatures rule out onion
planting, usually in late February. Then I put in a warm-season
crop such as green peppers, using the same timing.
   Planting times vary with climates and vegetables, of course, and
the process can be this simple or more complex, as desired.
   To determine plant-succession timing it's necessary to determine
the days needed for maturing. There are general guidelines for each
vegetable.
   Beets usually take 60 to 80 days; cauliflower 90 to 100 days;
carrots 60 to 100 days; eggplant 70 to 120 days; peppers 90 to 120
days. A reference book will help.
   More precise is the specific information in seed catalogs or on
seed packets. Some varieties of the same vegetables are genetically
ready to eat earlier or later than others.
   While seed sellers take this into account, they also tend to be
optimistic. So it's wise to routinely add a week or so to the
catalog-packet estimate. Then allow for some plants of the same
variety to mature later or before others.
   After such approximations, and if your beets, say, are supposed
to mature in 60 days, plant a third of the seed packet at the
recommended time, follow with another third 20 days later, and the
final third after another 20 days.
   The idea is to let nature's growth-regulating system supply
vegetables at peak quality over a long period. This works
especially well with crops such as lettuce, green onions, carrots,
radishes and beets, and is effective with just about everything
throughout a growing season.
   But it won't work for every vegetable, notably zucchini, which
seems to produce more than even zucchini lovers, like me, can
consume or give away despite careful planning.
   One friend never plants zucchini, on the theory that neighbors
will keep him supplied and he makes them fel great by accepting
their surplus. Another friend fills 20-pound grocery bags with
zucchini, places them on neighbor's doorsteps, rings the doorbell -
and runs.
   How is peak quality determined? Frequent sampling is effective
and simple. Remember that most vegetables taste best when fully
developed but before they turn the corner to maturity.
   Such an idea will bring hoots from commercial growers and from
home gardeners who freeze or can their produce. Their need is for
everything to be ready for harvest about the same time, for ease of
handling. Most seed crops are developed to meet such timing needs.
It's a valid position for mass production of food. It's also one
reason that so many store-bought vegetables taste so bland.
   So if taste is your reason for growing vegetables, experiment
with successive planting. There is nothing sacred about planting a
third of a seed packet at a time. Divide the packet by four or
five, or in half, if this works better.
   Remember, too, that growing seasons seldom are the same from
year to year. So adjustments may be needed.
   As for using sets to produce green onions, purists will insist
that scallions, or bunching onions, are best grown from seed
designed to produce white, ``bulbless'' onions. This is true. But
fresh onions for the table from sets are easy and inexpensive;
arrive three weeks or more before those from seeds; and can be
planted later in the season.
   They also are a great way to spark children's interest in
gardening. Kids love to push the marble-size sets into the ground
and love the almost immediate results. The process also has been
known to convert non-gardening adults.
   If space is limited, the most space-efficient vegetables include
beets, broccoli, beans, cabbage, carrots, leaf lettuce, onions,
radishes and tomatoes.

<HEAD>Attitude Contributes to Treatment of Older People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negative attitudes toward the elderly may
block their access to the rehabilitation services after accidents,
illness or surgery, a study says.
   The problem of paying for such services represents the greatest
barrier to obtaining them, according to the study, released this
summer by the American Association of Retired Persons.
   But it concluded that many older people do not get
rehabilitation largely because of their age.
   ``Many people associate rehabilitation only with younger persons
and the possibility of return to work and see no need to provide
these services to older people,'' it said.
   ``Yet rehabilitation can help older people to regain mobility
and live independently following a stroke, heart attack, hip
fracture or chronic illness.''
   Rehabilitation refers to services such as physical, occupational
and speech therapy and rehabilitative nursing and the report
asserts: ``The provision of rehabilitation services may make the
difference between a person who is bedfast and a person who can
walk with a walker.''

   The debate over how much the state should
pay for the cost of caring for nursing home residents has shifted
from the Statehouse to the courtroom.
   Two groups sued this month, alleging the state is not paying
enough.
   The Kansas Health Care Association and the Kansas Association
for Homes for the Aging filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court
against the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. The
groups represent 330 privately owned and non-profit nursing homes
in Kansas.
   ``We have worked extensively at the administrative and
legislative branches of government to work out a solution to the
rising health care costs of caring for our senior population, but
to no avail,'' said Lou Esplund, chairwoman of KAHA.
   The lawsuit complains that the SRS payment system violates a
federal law that requires states to pay ``reasonable and adequate
costs'' for nursing home care.
   Tim Owens, attorney for SRS, declined to comment.
   John Grace, president of the Kansas Association of homes for the
Aging, said federally mandated regulations took effect Oct. 1,
requiring that nurses be on duty 24 hours.
   The state has earmarked $2 million to cover the cost of that
regulation and others. But SRS officials estimated the total cost
would be $30 million.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal government opened fiscal 1991 with
a $31.5 billion deficit in October, the first month of what is
expected to be a record year for red ink, the Treasury Department
said.
   The budget gap was 21 percent higher than the $26.1 billion
deficit of October 1989. The increase reflects the buildup of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf and the escalation of the savings and
loan bailout, officials said Friday.

<TEXT>
   The largest private U.S. companies' sales have
doubled since 1985, due in large part to a dramatic rise in the
number of leveraged buyouts, Forbes magazine reports.
   But despite the huge shift as publicly-held companies turn
private, Minneapolis-based Cargill, a commodities marketer,
maintained a firm grip on the number one spot for the sixth
straight year of the Forbes annual ranking, with revenues of $44
billion last year.
   As companies continued to move up in the ranks in sales, one
prominent private-company billionaire - Donald Trump - dropped off
the ``Forbes 400'' list of the richest Americans, as his recent
financial woes have dramatically diminished his net worth.
   Among companies, Cargill's total sales were nearly triple the
sales of second-ranked Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries, a
petroleum, natural gas and chemicals firm with an estimated $17.2
billion in sales.
   All told, the Forbes list of top private firms in the Dec. 10
edition showed that sales of the biggest 400 companies increased
from $340 billion when the list was first started in 1985 to $609
billion last year. In 1989 the figure totaled $592 billion.
   Helping to boost the jump in sales, 120 of those firms have been
taken private in leveraged buyouts, including such giants as R.H.
Macy, RJR Nabisco, Trans World Airlines and the parents of Revlon
and Northwest Airlines.
   Forbes reported that 48 of the 400 largest companies are based
in New York -more than any other city.
   Chicago remains in second place on the ``Forbes 400'' list with
25 companies, followed by Dallas with 21 companies and Los Angeles
with nine. Detroit, Houston and San Francisco share fifth place
with seven firms each.
   The top state for private firms is New York with 65 companies.
However, California moved up fast in the ranks, in second place
with 42 companies up from seven last year. Texas is in third place
with 39 firms, followed by Illinois with 29 and Florida with 20.

<HEAD>Heseltine Would Bring the Biggest Changes, Economists Say</HEAD>

   Of the three contenders to succeed Margaret
Thatcher as prime minister, former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine would bring in the biggest economic changes, analysts
say.
   But no matter who wins, economists say, no drastic changes such
as big tax hikes or renationalizing industries are in sight.
   That's because Heseltine and the other two challengers, Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
are capitalist Conservative Party members with ``impeccable
Thatcherite credentials,'' as one economist put it.
   All three candidates have stressed that they want to build on
Mrs. Thatcher's accomplishments, while suggesting they envision a
gentler, kinder Britain.
   ``The differences between them are much more style than
substance,'' said George Hodgson, an analyst at the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.
   Paul Turnbull, an economist with Smith New Court PLC, said,
``The outlook for the U.K. economy is not radically different
whoever is in power.''
   Any of the three would continue current economic policy of high
interest rates to fight 10.9 percent inflation, although the winner
is expected to quickly cut the 14 percent base lending rate by a
half or full percentage point to gain popularity.
   The winner will have little control over the current, downward
course of the economy, partly because Britain has joined Europe's
exchange rate mechanism, the economists said.
   That limits the government's ability to change interest rates
very much because the pound must fluctuate within a narrow band.
   The new Conservative Party leader's policies are also bound to
be influenced by the necessity to contest the socialist Labor Party
in a national election by mid-1992.
   Heseltine, 57, is a flamboyant and ambitious self-made
publishing millionaire who has patiently waited his opportunity
since he walked out of Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet in 1986.
   He won enough votes from Conservative party members in a ballot
last week to force a second ballot this coming Tuesday, prompting
Mrs. Thatcher to resign. Major and Hurd then stepped forward
together in a friendly challenge to Heseltine.
   Also self-made, the 47-year-old Major is a poor acrobat's son
who climbed up from welfare recipient to banker to the top of his
party. His campaign promotes the creation of a classless
meritocracy in Britain.
   Hurd, 60, was educated at Eton and Cambridge and was a career
diplomat before entering politics. He has been in the Cabinet since
1984 but has never been involved with economic issues.
   The most notable difference among the challengers is that
Heseltine believes in government solutions to industrial problems.
Major and Hurd emphasize free markets, although Hurd is regarded as
the more liberal Tory of the two.
   ``Heseltine would try to make the management of the U.K. economy
similar in style to what he thinks happened in Japan and Germany,
where the government takes a much more interventionist line in
trying to achieve certain strategic aims in industry,'' said David
Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank.
   This has raised fears in the financial markets that he would
strap companies with obligations and increase public spending,
which would undermine the country's budget surplus and raise
interest rates.
   However, Kern added, ``I'm not so sure in practice there will be
that much difference.''
   The economists also said Heseltine would go furthest on the two
promises all the candidates have made: to embrace European union
more enthusiastically than Mrs. Thatcher did, and to take another
look at the highly unpopular per-capita community charge, or ``poll
tax.''
   However, Kern noted that whoever the winner is, ``Britain's
tense relationship with Europe won't become a great love affair.''
   Hodgson said all the contenders ``have got immaculate
Thatcherite credentials. They are all fully committed to
privatization. They're all fully committed to lowering tax rates as
quickly as possible and as is prudent,'' Hodgson said.
   ``You may say that Thatcher may have gone but the fundamental
commitment of the Conservative Party to widen individual choice (by
shrinking government) remains theirs,'' Hodgson said.

<HEAD>Reports: Matsushita Near Agreement on Purchase of MCA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment giant MCA Inc. was near a
decision on a buyout offer valued at more than $6.5 billion from
Japan's Matshushita Electric Industrial Co., published reports said
today.
   The Wall Street Journal said negotiations between the two
companies concluded late Sunday and that the MCA board was
preparing to approve the transaction.
   The Journal said the offer on the table was valued at about $6.8
billion, including $66 a share in cash and $5 a share in stock in
MCA's New York-area television station, WWOR-TV.
   Federal rules prohibit a foreign company from owning a broadcast
station.
   The New York Times said in today's editions that talks were
continuing Sunday night on a buyout at $71 or $72 a share including
cash and stock in the TV station. That would put the total value of
the deal at around $6.7 billion.
   Calls were placed to spokesman for both companies today, but
they were not immediately returned.
   If a deal were reached, MCA would be the second Hollywood studio
to be acquired by a Japanese company in little more than a year and
the fourth major American studio to be controlled by a
foreign-based owner.
   MCA's competitor, Sony Corp. of Japan, agreed in September 1989
to aquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for about $5 billion
including assumed debt.
   Two other major Hollywood studios are owned by foreign
companies. Twentieth Century Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. Ltd., based in Australia, and Italy's Pathe Communications
Corp. recently completed a $1.3 billion buyout of MGM-UA
Communications Inc.
   MCA is a major producer of movies such as ``Jaws,'' television
shows such as ``Murder, She Wrote'' and records by Sheena Easton,
Bobby Brown and Tiffany.
   Matshusita is a major consumer and industrial electronics
manufacturer, whose brands include include Pansasonic, Technics and
Quasar.
   It reportedly has been interested in an entertainment company to
complement its line of entertainment hardware such as televisions,
stereos and videocassette recorders.
   Talks between MCA and Matshushita were first disclosed in late
September, and it was reported they were discussing a price of $80
to $90 a share.
   The discussions reportedly intensified in the past week.
   MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., earned $191 million on
revenue of $3.4 billion last year.
   Matsushita earned $1.48 billion on sales of $37.8 billion last
year.

   Ube Industries Ltd., a Japanese maker of chemicals,
cement and machinery, established a joint venture with Britain's
Marubeni Corp. to provide plastic composites to users in Europe
such as automakers and producers of office automation equipment,
the Japanese companies announced Monday.
   The joint venture, European Technological Composites Ltd., is
capitalized at 2 million pounds, or $3.9 million, with Ube
Industries holding a 70 percent stake. Marubeni holds the
remainder.
   The joint venture aims to build its own plant in the U.K., which
is expected to produce plastic composites such as polypropylene
composites beginning April 1992. Combined output at the new plant
is seen at around 6,000 metric tons in the initial year, an
official at Ube Industries said.
   Ube Industries and Marubeni established a joint plastic venture
in Nashville, Tenn., in 1985.

   In the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said today it was buying MCA
Inc., owner of Universal Studios, for $6.06 billion.
   Matsushita, a $27 billion giant known for such brand names as
Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, is Japan's biggest manufacturer of
consumer electronics equipment.
   By buying the maker of such box office hits as ``Jaws'' and
``Back to the Future,'' Matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace
with archrival Sony Corp., which bought Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for $5 billion a year ago, analysts said.
   Universal is the fourth Hollywood studio to come under foreign
control. The deal seems likely to exacerbate some fears in the
United States that too many major U.S. companies are falling under
Japanese control.
   Under the agreement, Matsushita is to start a cash tender offer
of $66 a share for MCA's common stock by Nov. 30.
   MCA chairman and chief executive officer, Lew Wasserman, 77,
stands to earn about $330 million from the deal. Wasserman had
personal holdings of 5 million MCA shares, or 7 percent, and
controlled an additional 6 million through trusts and charities.
   ``Matsushita is a great international company,'' Wasserman said.
``This combination assures the structural integrity of MCA and its
worldwide operation. MCA will continue to operate under its own
name and will be run by its existing management.''
   The purchase, which followed two months of intense, sometimes
frustrating negotiations, is seen as Matsushita's attempt to
dominate the growing alliance of technological hardware and
entertainment industries.
   ``Software and hardware have been developing simultaneously -
they are like wheels of the same car,'' Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
president, said at company headquarters in Osaka. ``We intend that
excellent works made by MCA will be distributed all over the world
through a variety of media.''
   Analysts say Matsushita will now have a ready stock of
high-profile movie and television programming to use for its high
definition television, considered the next generation in home
entertainment.

   The stock market declined broadly today, faced
with resurgent oil prices and higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.51 points to
2,502.72 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 233 up, 747
down and 416 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.71 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The price of crude oil for January delivery jumped about $2 a
barrel, to near $34 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said the oil market heated up on word of a U.S. push
for a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of military
force if Iraq doesn't withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1.
   The same circumstances helped send bond prices lower and
interest rates higher in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
Treasury bonds slumped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields around 8.50 percent.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business

   Oil prices soared about $2 per barrel on the
futures market early today, as traders speculated the United
Nations was about to authorize the use of force to push Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   ``It's rocking and rolling in here this morning,'' said Brian
Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``The big news
is the U.S. is said to be seeking a Jan. 1 deadline for an Iraqi
withdrawal.''
   U.S. officials said they plan ask the U.N. Security Council this
week to approve a resolution that would authorize the use of
military force against Iraq if Saddam Hussein does not pull his
troops out of Kuwait by the first of the year. Iraq said it would
not get out of Kuwait, which it occupied during August.
   Oil traders responded by bidding up the price of crude oil by
almost $2 per barrel at the opening of trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``Traders are looking for the resolution to be approved,''
Tagler said. While a U.N. resolution would not be an act of war, he
said, the possibility that it will be approved leads oil traders to
believe war in the Persian Gulf is now more likely.
   By late morning, light sweet crude was up $2.05 at $33.95 on
contracts for delivery in January. Contracts for delivery in later
months were all sharply higher.
   As crude futures shot up, contracts of delivery of refined
petroleum products were also on the rise.
   Home heating oil jumped 6.04 cents to 94.70 per gallon on
contracts for delivery in December, with later contract months all
moving up by more than 5 cents a gallon.
   Unleaded gasoline was up 5.35 cents at 87.75 cents a gallon on
contracts for December delivery. Later contracts months all moved
higher.
   ``Products are just tracking the crude up,'' said Christian
Gohler, a broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Natural gas, meanwhile, was up 4.5 cents at $2.665 per 1,000
cubic feet on contracts for delivery in January. Later contract
months were also higher.
   Crude's rise today was its second big jump in a row. During
Friday's trading session, contracts for January delivery rose $2.27
a barrel. The session before that, crude moved up 72 cents.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Block Increase In `Baby' Bell Access Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a Texas telephone company that accused one of the so-called baby
Bell phone companies of trying to drive it out of business.
   The court, without comment, refused to block Southwestern Bell
from increasing access rates charged to the Texas company from
$5,000 to about $77,000 a month.
   The Texas firm, DFW Metro Line Services, offers customers a flat
rate for calls between Dallas and Fort Worth.
   DFW uses telephone lines leased from Southwestern Bell.
   The regional Bell company told DFW in June 1989 it must pay
about $77,000 a month to lease the lines.
   Southwestern Bell said it had been charging DFW only $5,000 a
month in the mistaken beief that DFW provided its customers with a
paging service only.
   But DFW said Southwestern's real motive was to drive the Texas
company out of business and eliminate a competitor.
   A federal judge refused DFW's request for an order that would
bar Southwestern from increasing the access rates pending the
outcome of DFW's lawsuit against the baby Bell company.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May also refused to
issue an injunction blocking the rate increase.
   The appeals court said DFW failed to show it would suffer
irreparable injury from the rate hike. The appeals court said that
if DFW loses customers or even is forced out of business, it
ultimately still could prevail in its suit against Southwestern and
recover any losses it suffered.
   ``The lost goodwill of a business operated over a short period
of time is usually compensable in money damages,'' the appeals
court said.
   DFW has been in business since 1988.
   The case is DFW Metro Line Services vs. Southwestern Bell,
90-670.

<HEAD>Soybeans Gain On Hopes For Soviet Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were modestly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after an opening
surge linked to perceptions that a U.S.-Soviet grain deal is near.
   Wheat futures were fractionally lower; corn futures were
slightly higher.
   Soviet grain-buying officials were visiting Washington today and
were expected to discuss with government representatives the
possibility of receiving export credits and striking a new
long-term grain agreement.
   Dan Cekander, grains analyst with the Chicago trading company
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc., said a new grain agreement is not likely
until the Soviets buy the 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and 1
million metric tons of U.S. wheat that remain under an existing
grain pact.
   Cekander said strength in international vegetable oil markets
also helped boost soybean prices.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.48\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.22} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $1.07 a
bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with January at
$5.84\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, paced by sharp losses in the pork
complex.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December
at 79.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .32 cent
lower with January at 87.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .70 cent
to 1.25 cents lower with December at 52.20 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.8 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
lower with February at 69.40 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures rose while pork futures fell on Friday.

<HEAD>Rig Count Jumps by 72 to Rebound After Two Weeks of Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two weeks of declines, the number of
working oil and gas rigs in the United States rebounded by 72 this
week to bring the total to 1,175 nationwide, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported Monday.
   ``Some of that clearly is improvement of the weather that had
been bad for the past two weeks, particularly in Oklahoma,'' said
Ike Kerridge, a vice president at the toolmaker which keeps the
count. ``But it also relates to the seasonal upturn expected during
the last quarter of the year.''
   The number of rigs had fallen by 41 rigs over the past two
weeks, following heavy rains in the Oklahoma area. A year ago this
week, the number of working rigs was 1,037.
   Kerridge said he could not forecast changes for the count, but
believed it would grow in December because drillers will be using
any remaining funds in calendar-year budgets.
   ``I still expect to see a rig count around 1,250 in December,
but whether that will be at the beginning of the month or the
middle or the end, I can't say,'' Kerridge said. ``The weather and
the random movement of rigs that can effect it makes it impossible
to predict on a week-by-week basis.''
   Decreases in the previous weeks came on the heels of a milestone
earlier in the month when the number of working rigs reached 1,144
- a high figure not seen since Dec. 28, 1987.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count - the widely
watched index of drilling activity - since 1940. The count
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those
producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Texas led the major oil producing states for the week, by adding
23 rigs to the count, followed by Oklahoma, whose count increased
by 16, and Louisiana, which added 11 rigs.
   Other major oil producing states reporting increases for the
week include California, up by nine; Wyoming, adding eight;
Colorado, adding six; Kansas, which increased by four; New Mexico,
up by three; and Michigan and North Dakota, which each added a rig.
   Ohio was the only major oil producing state to report a loss for
the week, dropping by one. The count in Pennsylvania remained
unchanged.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Freezing Half of Businesses' Accounts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today proposed freezing 50 percent
of the bank accounts of state-owned businesses by Saturday in an
effort to cut the national budget deficit, Tass reported.
   The national defense budget also would drop by 10 percent and
other Soviet agencies would take cuts of up to 30 percent under the
1991 national budget proposed to the legislature, the official news
agency said.
   Finance Minister Victor Pavlov also said the nation's gross
national product in the first nine months of 1990 dropped by 13
billion rubles, or $23.4 billion at the official rate, from the
previous year, according to Tass. The government last month had
said GNP for the period dropped 1.5 percent.
   The report was one of the most comprehensive yet on the state of
the national economy. But a flourishing black market, critical
shortages of most basic consumers goods and economic rebellion by
many of the 15 Soviet republics made it difficult to determine how
the final budget would shape up.
   Tass said the government budget was being divided for the first
time into national and republic levels. It put the national
government's share of the budget at 261 billion rubles, slightly
less than half the total.
   The proposal on bank accounts, if approved, would be the first
large sell-off of shares in state-owned businesses in Soviet
history and a significant step in a massive scheme to denationalize
state-owned industries.
   The proposal amounts to a drastic, last-ditch effort to cut the
enormous Soviet budget deficit before the end of the year. The
deficit stood last year at about 120 billion rubles.
   Pavlov told lawmakers that officials projected that this year's
national deficit would be 56 billion rubles, or about $100 billion,
out of a budget of 508 billion rubles, $915 billion. It was not
clear if the figures included the spending freeze.
   The proposal would allow employees to receive the frozen funds
only in the form of stock shares in their companies.
   Tass said the government would freeze 50 billion to 60 billion
rubles, $90 billion $108 billion, of state-owned businesses'
accounts - half of their total deposits - that the enterprises fail
to use before Saturday.
   But the resources may be transferred to work collectives to buy
shares in the enterprises. The news agency said the moratorium
would be temporary, but did not say how long it would last. It was
not clear whether employees would hold the stock in their own names
or as a group.
   As part of the attempt to slash the budget deficit, 1991 foreign
aid will be cut to one-quarter of this year's level, Tass said. A
number of Communist countries, such as Cuba, have relied heavily on
Soviet subsidies and are likely to be hit hard by the cutbacks.
   The defense budget is to drop to 64 billion rubles, $115
billion, next year, Tass said. That would be roughly 40 percent of
the proposed national budget.
   The Soviet government bureaucracy faces a 30 percent budget cut,
Tass reported. No other details were offered and it was unclear
which government agencies would be hit hardest.

   In the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said today it would buy MCA
Inc., owner of Universal Studios, in a deal worth $6.6 billion.
   Matsushita, a $37.8 billion giant known for such brand names as
Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, is Japan's biggest manufacturer of
consumer electronics equipment.
   By buying the maker of such box office hits as ``Jaws'' and
``Back to the Future,'' Matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace
with archrival Sony Corp., which bought Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for $5 billion a year ago, analysts said.
   Universal is the fourth Hollywood studio to come under foreign
control. The deal seems likely to exacerbate some fears in the
United States that too many major U.S. companies are falling under
Japanese control.
   Under the agreement, Matsushita is to start a cash tender offer
of $66 a share for MCA's about 92.8 million shares of common stock
by Nov. 30.
   MCA shareholders will also get stock in a television station
that cannot be sold to Matsushita because federal rules prohibit
foreign-based companies from owning U.S. broadcast stations.
   The deal calls for MCA shareholders to get one share in a new
company that will own MCA's New York-area television station, WWOR,
for every five shares of MCA stock they own just before the tender
offer is completed.
   Company officials have estimated the new shares will be worth
about $5 for every share of MCA stock. Adding that to the $66 per
share in cash brings the per-share value to $71, or nearly $6.6
billion, for MCA's fully diluted shares.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MCA was the most
actively traded issue, slipping 25 cents a share by late morning to
$65.12{.
   MCA chairman and chief executive officer, Lew Wasserman, 77,
stands to earn about $355 million from the deal based on his
personal holdings alone of about 5 million MCA shares, or 7
percent. In addition, he controls an additional 6 million through
trusts and charities.
   ``Matsushita is a great international company,'' Wasserman said.
``This combination assures the structural integrity of MCA and its
worldwide operation. MCA will continue to operate under its own
name and will be run by its existing management.''
   The purchase, which followed two months of intense, sometimes
frustrating negotiations, is seen as Matsushita's attempt to
dominate the growing alliance of technological hardware and
entertainment industries.
   ``Software and hardware have been developing simultaneously -
they are like wheels of the same car,'' Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
president, said at company headquarters in Osaka. ``We intend that
excellent works made by MCA will be distributed all over the world
through a variety of media.''
   Analysts say Matsushita will now have a ready stock of
high-profile movie and television programming to use for its high
definition television, considered the next generation in home
entertainment.
   ``Matsushita has been behind Sony in audio-visual and
entertainment fields in the last couple of years,'' said Takatoshi
Yamamoto of the investment firm Morgan Stanley. ``By acquiring MCA,
Matsushita can obtain movie, record, broadcast and publishing
industries all at once.
   ``Looking at the long-term effect of the deal, it will benefit
Matsushita in producing and marketing HDTV, the competition for
which is expected to intensify in the mid-1990s,'' he said.
   But in an atmosphere of trade friction between the United States
and Japan -not to mention the potential of a further downturn in
the U.S. economy - Matsushita is taking a big risk, analysts say.
   ``The biggest problem is the negative image f Japanese buying
up everything in the U.S.,'' said Rodney Harada, an analyst for
Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``One of the biggest reasons I was
surprised by the deal was because Matsushita has always been
careful to improve its image before.''
   In addition to the Japanese purchases, 20th Century Fox is owned
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., based in Australia, and
Italian-controlled Pathe Communications Corp. recently completed a
$1.3 billion buyout of MGM-UA Communications Inc.
   Japanese companies have caught most of the U.S. criticism,
however, after making other high-profile purchases such as
Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf club.
   But Matsushita, one of the world's leading manufacturers of
industrial equipment and semiconductors, may have considered the
deal a risk it couldn't refuse.
   Japanese consumer electronics companies have been looking to
Hollywood to revitalize a flagging market for consumer video
products and expand their control over the lucrative home
entertainment market. Purchases of film libraries, for instance,
allow them to release old movies and television shows in videotape
format.
   ``People don't watch electrons and pixels,'' Steven Ross,
chairman of another entertainment industry hybrid, Time-Warner
Inc., said in a recent speech. ``They watch movies and programs.
... New technologies are still-born without software to animate
them.''
   Sony also purchased CBS Records, for example, and successfully
used it in the 1980s to launch the compact disc as a format.
   Nonetheless, several analysts said the much-touted ``natural''
linkup between hardware manufacturers and movie, video and TV
entertainment companies is still an unproven strategy. For one
thing, digitalizing older movies and TV programs for HDTV is very
expensive.
   ``It looks like they're doing it and trying to figure out
strategy afterward,'' said Mike Jeremy, an analyst in Tokyo for
Baring Securities.
   In Japan, Matsushita is jokingly called ``Maneshita,'' or
``copycat,'' for its custom of introducing products only after its
competitors have tested the market for them.
   But some people envision a future of integrated home
entertainment consoles that would include HDTV, a personal
computer, stereo and other gadgetry. And that future may accrue to
the company with the most prominent image, analysts said.
   ``Sony has a strong image. People in most countries would
automatically know what a Walkman is,'' said Jeremy. ``Matsushita
has Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, but they need to rationalize
themselves into one image.''
   Apart from Universal Pictures, which also produced such hits as
``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' MCA's holdings include a robust
television division featuring winners like ``Murder, She Wrote''
and ``Quantum Leap.'' MCA Records carries the popular teen vocalist
Tiffany, as well as the sultry star Sheena Easton.
   MCA, which earned $191 million last year on revenues of $3.4
billion, also owns a book publishing division, theme parks and real
estate.
   Matsushita earned $1.48 billion on sales of $37.8 billion last
year.

   From a can of beans to a new car to a $100,000
variable rate mortgage, it's nearly impossible these days to find
out in advance how much cash you'll be paying out.
   It may get worse. With recession threatening and consumer
confidence low, so many merchants are cutting prices that the slash
mark in advertisements is almost as common as the dollar sign.
   There are regular prices, discount prices, former prices,
today-only prices, sale prices, cash-only prices, credit card
prices, special prices, one-time-only prices and prices with
discounts and rebates.
   Mix in sales taxes and cents-off and dollars-off coupons, and
maybe figure in the specials of the day at the grocery store, and
the arithmetic defies your ability to determine the total bill.
   Should you plan ahead and do the calculations in advance, you
might then find prices changed by the time you get to the store.
Quick price changes are easy on high-volume items, and electronic
computers make it all the easier.
   Price confusion has long been the bane of the frequent traveler,
who is confronted with so many airline rates - and exceptions by
day of week or week of year - that agents become addled and can't
figure their own commission.
   Car rental contracts may add mystery to the trip, and hotel room
charges, including local taxes, can make a mockery of so-called
quick checkout services. Skip the car rental and take a cab? Sure,
and try to decipher the rate card.
   Perhaps you buy a car instead. By law, prices are posted on new
car sales, but rare is the person who can predict to the penny what
the total will be. If a trade-in is involved, a Nobel laureate
might shy from the challenge.
   So you stay home. Nobody says you have to buy; you can
communicate by telephone instead. Yes, but your telephone bills
might be too involved to communicate with you.
   Well, you can read, too, and as your peruse your magazine you
pull out a card offering a big discount off the newsstand price.
Meanwhile, you spot an ad for the latest bestseller novel:
``Published price $19.95. Our price $16.54.''
   In this day and age, of course, you can also communicate by
facsimile or computer, but to get into that modern mode you must
first own one or the other. You search the ads, and you read:
``Under $799,'' and ``From $499 up.''
   This is a free-market economy at work, the biggest in the world,
and you might argue that a variety of prices and frequent price
changes reflect intense competition. But there are those who are
convinced it is meant to confuse.
   How in the name of rationality, they ask, did automobile prices,
to cite one example out of thousands, get way up there after years
of refunds, rebates, dealer discounts, and desperate salesmen
giving up part of their commissions?
   How, they ask, do consumer prices rise at 5 percent a year if
almost everyone is slashing away like a bushwacker in the jungle,
and most of the rest are boasting that theirs are everyday low
prices?
   There is a mystery here, and a challenge to those would seek the
answers. It is important to us all, somewhere on the scale between
those other great unknowns, such as where the lost socks go and
what's out there in space.

   Stock prices showed some spotty losses today
under pressure from resurgent oil prices and higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.89 points to

   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 9 to 5 in nationwide

   Analysts said the oil market heated up on word of a U.S. push
for a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of military
force if Iraq doesn't withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1.
   The same circumstances helped send bond prices lower and
interest rates higher in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
Treasury bonds declined slightly, putting their yields around 8.45
percent.
   MCA led the active list, off &lsqb; at 65\. Negotiators agreed on a

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Florida Affirmative Action Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to end an
affirmative action program aimed at awarding more public works
contracts to businesses run by minorities and women.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by companies that
said the Tampa, Fla.-area program is unconstitutional because it
condones reverse discrimination against white men.
   The affirmative action program was adopted in 1984 by
Hillsborough County, which set a goal of awarding 25 percent of the
value of all annual construction contracts to businesses owned by
women and minorities.
   The program, in effect, calls for officials to favor contractors
who have lined up companies run by minorities and women as
subcontractors.
   If the contractor submitting the low bid on a project has met
the county's affirmative action goals, that company is likely to
win the contract. But the low bidder may lose if it fails to
convince officials it has at least made a good-faith effort to meet
those goals.
   In other cases affecting businesses, the court:
   -Rejected a challenge to the seizure by U.S. Customs agents of
some 2,700 allegedly obscene magazines that were shipped from
Cleveland and denied entry into Canada. The justices, without
comment, let stand rulings that the magazines could be treated as
imports from a foreign country once they were headed back to
Cleveland.
   -Refused to kill two fair-housing lawsuits that stem from
newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models
posing as homeowners. The justices, without comment, let stand a
ruling that forces developers of a Virginia condominium community
to defend themselves against allegations they violated the Fair
Housing Act.
   -Rejected an appeal by a Texas telephone company that accused
one of the ``Baby Bell'' local phone companies of trying to drive
it out of business. The court, without comment, refused to block
Southwestern Bell from increasing access rates charged to the Texas
company from $5,000 to about $77,000 a month.
   In the Florida affirmative action case, after a group of
white-owned construction companies sued to overturn the program, a
federal judge ruled it was unconstitutional and barred the county
from enforcing it.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the judge last
August and reinstated the program, saying that at least on its
face, it does not violate the Constitution's equal-protection
guarantees.
   The appeals court sent the suit back for a trial at which the
white-owned companies will have a chance to prove their
allegations.
   The court said the Hillsborough plan appears to be significantly
different from a so-called set-aside program adopted by Richmond,
Va., that was overturned by the Supreme Court last year.
   The Richmond plan established a quota that required 30 percent
of the value of annual public works contracts to be awarded to
minority businesses.
   In striking down that plan, the high court said local
governments must narrowly tailor affirmative action plans to remedy
proven past bias.
   The appeals court said Hillsborough County acted only after a
six-year, wholly voluntary plan failed to do enough to help
minorities and women in the building industry.
   ``Unlike Richmond, Hillsborough County decided to implement its
law based on statistics indicating that there was discrimination
specifically in the construction business commissioned by the
county,'' the appeals court said.
   It noted that the county shunned rigid quotas and only adopted
flexible goals for awarding contracts to minorities and women.

<HEAD>Production Cuts Also Hit Canadian Auto Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers said 12,600 employees in
Canada will be laid off temporarily on top of the 38,800 U.S.
employees being furloughed due to sagging North American sales.
   Ford Motor Co. said that starting Monday, 1,600 workers at Ford
of Canada's Oakville, Ontario, truck plant would be laid off for
two weeks and 1,150 workers at its two V-8 engine plants in
Windsor, Ontario, would begin a one-week layoff.
   Ford said 700 people at its Essex V-6 engine plant in Windsor
would be laid off for one week starting Dec. 10.
   The company's glass plant in Niagara Falls, Ontario, laid off
350 employees Monday, with 150 scheduled to return next Monday and
the remainder to stay off for another week.
   Ford of Canada spokesman Jim Hartford said the layoffs were due
to slumping sales in Canada and in the United States, where 80
percent of the company's Canadian production goes.
   General Motors of Canada announced layoffs of 7,000 employees in
Ontario and Quebec last week, also citing slow sales.
   Chrysler Canada extended a Nov. 19 layoff of 1,800 workers at
its van plant in Windsor through the first week of December.
   The pinch will be eased for employees by Canadian Auto Workers
union contract agreements that provide laid-off workers with up to
95 percent of base pay during shutdowns.
   General Motors, Ford and Chrysler said the 38,000 U.S. layoffs,
also aimed at cutting production to match slow demand, began at
Thanksgiving and would run through Dec. 7 at 14 assembly plants in
eight states.

   Stock prices pulled back a bit today under
pressure from resurgent oil prices and higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.17 points to
2,519.06 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 577 up, 853 down and
510 unchanged.
   The price of crude oil for January delivery jumped about $1.75 a
barrel, to more than $33.50 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Analysts said the oil market heated up on word of a U.S. push
for a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of military
force if Iraq doesn't withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1.
   The same circumstances helped send bond prices lower and
interest rates higher in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
Treasury bonds declined slightly, putting their yields around 8.45
percent.
   MCA led the active list, off &lsqb; at 65\. Negotiators agreed on a
price of $66 a share in cash, plus stock of a subsidiary, for
Matsushita Electrical's planned acquisition of MCA.
   Losers among the blue chips included Boeing, down 1 at 43|;
General Electric, down { at 53&lsqb;; Westinghouse Electric, down } at
26\, and General Motors, down &lsqb; at 37\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.42 to 171.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .48 at 295.42.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fading hopes for new
sales of U.S. crops to the Soviet Union.
   Most of the gains posted late last week were erased by selling
that accelerated after Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
the Bush administration still insists the Soviet Union formally
liberalize its emigration policies before it can be eligible for
export credit guarantees.
   Soviet grain-buying officials met with Agriculture Department
officials Monday. Crop futures prices, especially for soybeans, had
risen sharply ahead of the meetings on speculation they could lead
to new grain sales.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4\ cents to 6{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.43} a bushel; corn was
1} cents to 4 cents lower with December at $2.18{ a bushel; oats

   Norman P. Blake Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer of Heller International Corp., was named on
Monday as chairman, president and chief executive officer of USF&amp;G
Corp.
   Blake, 49, has been the head of Chicago-based Heller since 1984.
He succeeds Jack Moseley, who took early retirement earlier this
month.
   USF&amp;G is a diversified financial services company based in
Baltimore. It sells property and casualty and life insurance, as
well as financial services. The company recently slashed its
dividend and embarked on a $75 million cost-cutting program earlier
this month after losing $15 million in the third quarter.
   USF&amp;G said it would cut costs by reducing staff at all levels.
   ``USF&amp;G is an industry leader with a strong national franchise
and a proud winning tradition,'' Blake said. ``The insurance
sector, like the entire financial services industry, is entering an
era of change that will require energy and creativity to meet
competitive challenges.''
   At Heller International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Fuji
Bank Ltd. of Tokyo, Blake led a strong turnaround in profitability.
   He also worked at General Electric Credit Corp. as executive
vice president financing operations, and from 1974 to 1976 was
president of TOP Inc., a Detroit-based provider of insurance
services.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Allows Whooping-Cough Suit to Continue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs at end on claims deadlines. Also moving on
general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to shield
a whooping cough vaccine manufacturer from a lawsuit that said
company negligence caused brain damage in an inoculated infant.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories to stop the suit.
   Michelle Graham was given the vaccine in 1980 when she was a few
months old. Soon after, she was diagnosed as suffering from severe
brain damage that causes retardation.
   The Grahams, who sued Wyeth in Kansas and have since moved to
Cabool, Mo., said the New York City-based company was negligent.
   The vaccine is used to immunize children against diphtheria,
tetanus and pertussis. Charles and Tammy Graham said the vaccine
component against pertussis, or whooping cough, was responsible for
their daughter's brain damage.
   A federal jury's $15 million award to the Grahams was overturned
by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June.
   But the appeals court, while saying the trial judge improperly
excluded evidence that could help the drug company, refused to kill
the suit.
   Wyeth said such suits should be precluded because its vaccine is
licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The company argued that letting the Grahams sue has the effect
of making state laws supreme over federal law in violation of the
Constitution.
   Kansas laws on personal injury claims govern the outcome of the
suit, even though it would be tried in federal court in that state.
   Congress recently extended the deadline to file claims under the
National Vaccine Injury Act, which provides some compensation for
those injured by vaccines.
   The deadline for those injured on or before Oct. 1, 1988, was
extended from Oct. 1, 1990, to Jan. 31, 1991. But failure to file
by the deadline does not bar the Grahams or anyone else frm suing
for damages.

<HEAD>Wood Products Company Expects No Better Than Break-Even Fourth
Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. said Monday it expects
to break even financially during the final three months of 1990.
   Officials at the wood products company said a weakening market
for paper, pulp and corrugated containers, expansion costs and
higher interest rates will reduce Boise Cascade's profitability.
   In a statement, the corporation predicted ``results for the
fourth quarter of 1990 to be close to break-even'' compared with
earnings of 27 cents per share in the third quarter.
   A break-even quarter would leave the company with just over $70
million in net income for 1990. That compares to $267.6 million in
1989, $289.1 million in 1988 and $183 million in 1987.
   In its earnings forecast, the company cited further weakening in
some markets, high interest rates and modernization expenses at its
mills in Rumford, Maine, and International Falls, Minn. It also
said its building products segment has been operating at a loss
since September because of high wood costs, sluggish demand and
declining prices.
   Boise-Cascade has been on a cost-efficiency drive since
undergoing severe economic stress in the early 1980s while
gradually shifting its emphasis away from building products to
paper and paper products.

   Iran has reached agreement on direct

   The company, which imports about 200,000 barrels a day of gas

   In the past, many Gulf states banned the sale of oil products to
Iran because of their political support for Iraq during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait as dramatically
reversed that political situation, and the Arab states are now

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a looming recession, Alan Markus began
the Christmas season at his Lazarus department store without the
financial worries that dogged the company a year ago.
   Christmas 1989 fell three weeks before an avalanche of junk bond
debt forced Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp. to seek bankruptcy court protection for Lazarus,
Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and seven other department store
chains.
   But the Lazarus that Markus manages a block away from Federated
and Allied headquarters can already see the difference a year
makes.
   In 1989, ``we experienced some situations where we had
difficulty receiving merchandise, whereas this year that's not a
problem,'' Markus said in an interview recently.
   As they undergo Chapter 11 reorganization, Federated and Allied,
subsidiaries of Toronto-based Campeau Corp., have back some of the
stability and confidence they lacked at the start of last year's
Christmas shopping season.
   Under bankruptcy law, their current suppliers are guaranteed
payment. And while the retailers have undertaken a series of
cost-cutting steps, other storeowners are now being forced to make
the same moves to protect themselves from the current slump in
consumer spending.
   To cut costs, the Federated and Allied chains have centralized
their credit operations, cut back their executive staff and set up
committees to plan merchandise buying. Their bankruptcy court
status also let them end an expensive lease in New York.
   ``If there is a plus to our being in reorganization, it's that
we have already taken those steps,'' Federated and Allied
spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   Janet Mangano, an industry analyst for Jessup, Josephthal &amp; Co.,
said of the Campeau units, ``They're probably one of the
best-positioned (retailers) because they were pretty much faced
with the worst kind of environment - excluding a recession - in
1990.''
   ``They changed their merchandise mix and got their shop in
order,'' she said.
   Federated and Allied sought protection from their creditors on
Jan. 15, citing $7.7 billion in debts, much of it from the
high-priced junk bonds Campeau issued to buy the retailing giants.
   Retailers across the country - Federated and Allied included -
are faced with a sharp drop-off in consumer spending this Christmas
season. Retail sales, already sluggish because of the weakening
economy, stalled in the summer after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
sent oil prices higher and left consumers with little extra money
to go shopping with.
   Department stores were particularly hard-hit as customers cut
out buying non-essentials such as clothing, furniture and home
appliances - the core of their business.
   The Federated and Allied chains - which also include Maas
Brothers, Bon Marche, Abraham &amp; Straus, Rich's-Goldsmith's,
Burdine's and Stern's - reported $680 million in sales in October,
below expectations.
   Some of the stores, including the 40 Bon Marche branches in the
Northwest, reported a good start to the Christmas shopping season.
However, how well the retailers ultimately do during the holidays
won't be known until after Dec. 25.
   Ms. Sanger said the companies have not altered their prediction,
made in October, that they will emerge from bankruptcy next year.
The forecast was based on the belief that a recession in the retail
business would last through most of the year, she said.
   ``It's fair to say we would be more concerned if this were the
year we were emerging from reorganization, because ... we would be
facing more difficulties,'' she said.
   At the Lazarus in Cincinnati, Markus said he was prepared for
customers to spend less money this year.
   ``I think our merchandise content is better this year and
focused on strong key items ... identified as good sellers for the
Christmas season,'' Markus said.
   ``We hope to come close to meeting last year's figures,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co.
will be sold to ``a qualified American buyer'' when Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. completes its acquisition of MCA Inc.,
officials said Monday.
   The park concession has been a small but controversial division
of MCA, which Matsushita has offered to acquire in a deal worth
$6.6 billion.
   Matsushita, one of Japan's largest consumer electronics
manufacturers, will spin the concession off to blunt criticism over
a Japanese company operating a national park concession. Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan has indicated he would oppose a foreign
company playing a major role at Yosemite or other parks.
   A press release said Matsushita will sell the concession ``to be
responsive to environmental and other concerns that have been
raised.''
   The concession will be sold within a year after Matsushita's
acquisition of MCA is completed, the press release added.
   ``Prior to the sale, Yosemite Park and Curry will be held in
escrow and operated by its existing management and board,'' said
John Poimiroo, the concession's vice president for communications.
He explained that Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. currently has a board
of directors separate from MCA's.
   Between the time the sale of MCA becomes final and Matsushita
sells Curry, the concession's income will be donated to the
National Park Foundation to benefit Yosemite and other national
parks, Poimiroo said.
   Whoever buys the concession will have to seek renewal of its
contract with the National Park Service in 1993.
   Renewal may not be gained easily because MCA has been criticized
for paying too little in its current agreement, and one other
bidder already has surfaced. A group of environmentalists have
formed the non-profit Yosemite Restoration Trust to try to win the
concession business which includes restaurants, stores,
transportation and lodging.
   David Curry began the concession in 1899, nine years after the
park was founded. The present company was formed in 1925 and
purchased by MCA in 1973.

<HEAD>Whittle Says More than 5,700 Schools Signed Up for Channel One</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications said Monday that more
than 5,700 schools have signed contracts for its commercially
sponsored Channel One news show for teens, and expects to reach its
goal of 8,600 schools by next June.
   Chairman Christopher Whittle said all of the service's available
commercial time has been either sold or optioned for sale to 13
different advertisers for the January-June period.
   Ed Winter, the Whittle executive overseeing the Channel One
project, told reporters at a news briefing that Channel One should
generate $65 million in gross revenue this school year, during
which the number of schools under contract rose from about 600 in
October 1989 to its November total of 5,718.
   He said revenues should rise to $110 million in the 1991-92
school year, which would be the first at which the service operated
for an entire year with its full complement of schools.
   Winter said that is more than four times the $25 million Cable
News Network generated in its third year and more than triple the
$37 million that ESPN produced in its third year in operation. ESPN
and CNN are among the biggest cable TV networks in the United
States.
   The Channel One service has been widely criticized by national
education groups for bringing paid advertising into the classroom,
when children are required by law to be in school and must sit and
watch.
   Each 12-minute show includes two minutes of paid commercials for
products such as breath mints, candy bars, movies and toothpaste.
   Whittle transmits the show to schools by satellite overnight
each night. The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company equips every
participating school with videocassette recorders and TV monitors
for every classroom that the schools can keep as long as they show
the program, with ads, daily to all their students.
   The producers of the program say schools would not have access
to the equipment were it not for the money generated for it from
commercials.
   The schools signed to date are in every state except Hawaii,
Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Nevada.
   Whittle told reporters that once Channel One reaches 8,000
schools, it will begin to exhaust its budget for equipment and will
have to sign up more advertisers to pay for the additional TVs and
VCRs.
   He said Channel One won't increase the amount of advertising it
carries per show, but may cut back on how often each advertiser
appears and may cut out its donation of free time for public
service messages such as anti-drug ads.
   Advertisers are currently charged at a rate of $150,000 for a
30-second commercial reaching an audience of 6 million teens.
Whittle says that rate compares favorably with those available for
reaching teens on other TV shows.
   For next school year, Whittle said he hopes to use the Channel
One system to make available up to five special programs that may
include advertising or be available on a pay-per-view basis to
schools that wish to show them.
   He said topics for the specials could include a 30-minute
program on a space shot, for instance, or shows related to academic
courses.
   In addition, he said Channel One will consider leasing its
transmission system to other program producers for after-school
events like a rock concert, a sports show or meetings by various
groups.
   Participating schools will not be obligated to use such
programs.
   ``We don't make the decision on whether these programs will be
aired. The schools make the decision on whether to air it,'' he
said.
   Whittle said he doesn't expect the revenue generated from such
programs will ever exceed 15 percent of the revenue generated for
Channel One.

   The stock market overcame a broad early setback
to finish slightly higher Monday in another session of light
activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 30 points at
its morning low, closed with a 5.94 gain at 2,533.17.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by less than 10 to 9 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
785 up, 728 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.54 million
shares, against Friday's four-year low of 63.35 million.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.06 million shares.
   Prices fell at the outset as oil prices rose sharply and
interest rates climbed. But the pressure on both bonds and stocks

   The price of crude oil for January delivery climbed about $1 a

   Interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds, which climbed to
about 8.50 percent in the early going, fell back to near 8.41

end of last week.
   Wall Streeters are expecting a challenge of sorts to the recent
bond-market rally later this week, when the government reports on
the gross national product for the third quarter of the year.
   Economists are looking for the data to show an increase at an
annual rate of 2.1 percent or 2.2 percent, after adjustment for

<HEAD>U.S. Might Step Up Export Subsidies, Yeutter Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States may boost subsidies of its
agricultural exports should international trade talks fail to
reduce foreign trade barriers, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Monday.
   The final round of the talks is scheduled next week in Brussels,
and the chances of reaching an agreement to cut agricultural
subsidies worldwide is ``very slim,'' Yeutter said.
   Yeutter has refused to say how the United States would retaliate
against European countries if they refuse to agree to subsidy cuts
the United States wants.
   ``What I've indicated persistently and consistently in recent
months ... is that we'll protect our own interests. The (European)
Community can draw its own conclusions as to what that means, and
we're not going to telescope what that means,'' Yeutter said.
   However, the 1990 farm bill authorizes Congress to increase U.S.
export subsidies to $1 billion a year to counter foreign farm
supports. About $425 million is budgeted for 1991.
   ``We're pleased that authorization is there because it may
become essential,'' Yeutter said during a question-and-answer
session with reporters.
   EC countries spend 20 times as much as the United States on
export subsidies, Yeutter said. ``That's just an intolerable
situation.''
   The Bush administration proposed eliminating 75 percent of
current domestic farm supports and import barriers and reducing
export subsidies by 90 percent.
   The EC has offered to trim 30 percent of 1986 support levels.
   The farm issue is considered key to completion of the current
round of global trade talks, which involve 105 nations under the
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The administration has made GATT reform a top priority in the
belief that lowering trade barriers offers the best chance of
expanding U.S. exports of agricultural products and other goods and
services.
   Dairy producers, for example, need new markets overseas because
domestic consumption is reaching its limit, Yeutter said.
   He defended the market orientation of the 1990 farm bill, saying
it would benefit farmers whose planting practices were restricted
by government policy.
   The five-year farm bill now awaiting President Bush's signature
gives farmers the option of planting what they choose on 15 percent
of the acreage that is normally reserved for subsidized crops.
   Another provision would pay farmers to idle wheat acreage and
plant sunflowers and other oilseeds that many farmers have quit
growing in recent years.
   ``If we believe in markets we should be favorably disposed to
these provisions,'' Yeutter said. ``If we don't believe in markets
we should move to the Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on Gulf Jitters, Gold Also Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced moderately against most
major currencies Monday, boosted by growing concerns about the
Middle East.
   Gold prices moved moderately higher.
   Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were ``Middle
East-driven,'' with traders focused on the Bush administration's
attempts to win support for a proposed U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizing military force to drive Iraqi troops out of
Kuwait.
   Investors tend to view the dollar as a relatively safe haven
during times of political uncertainty overseas.
   Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for Bank of New
York Co., said other currencies - in particular the German mark -
were also beneficiaries of fears about war. The mark declined
against the dollar, but gained against other currencies.
   The dollar closed at 1.4870 marks in New York, up from 1.4860 on
Friday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.4920
German marks, up from 1.4860.
   The U.S. currency rose as far as 1.4948 marks in New York but
then fell back, leaving traders skeptical about the dollar's
chances for holding on to its gains.
   Meanwhile, the yen suffered as war speculation raised questions
about the Japanese economy. The counrry is heavily dependent on the
Middle East for its energy needs, importing 99 percent of the oil
it uses.
   The dollar jumped to 129.05 yen in New York from late Friday's
127.10. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.95 yen, up 0.82 yen from
Thursday's close of 127.13 yen. There was no trading in Tokyo on
Friday because of a holiday.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 128.75 yen.
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance against the British
pound. Sterling rose to $1.96895 in New York from late Friday's
$1.9668. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.9655 from $1.9670
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.2620 Swiss francs, up from 1.2600; 5.0130 French
francs, up from 5.0115; 1,116.125 Italian lire, up from 1,115.50;
and 1.16075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16015.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.4920 German marks, up from 1.4860; 1.2680 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2583; 5.0300 French francs, up from 5.0075; 1.6823 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6760; 1,118.75 Italian lire, up from 1,115.00;
and 1.1596 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1592.
   Gold rose in New York, picking up $2.40 to close at $386.10 a
troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $386.15, up $2.40.
   In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid price of $387.00 a
troy ounce from $383.75 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $386.50 from $383.25 late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $7.10 an ounce to close at $386.35.
   Silver prices also rose, with the metal gaining 2.3 cents to
close at $4.149 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. In London,
silver rose to a late bid price of $4.18 a troy ounce from Friday's
$4.15.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall As Hopes For Soviet Sales Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell broadly Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid fading hopes for new sales of U.S.
crops to the Soviet Union.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures plunged; cattle futures
were mostly higher; oil futures surged; and precious metals
advanced.
   In Chicago, wheat futures settled 4 cents to 6 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.43{ a bushel; corn was
1} cents to 3} cents lower with December at $2.18} a bushel; oats
were 3\ cents to 4 cents lower with December at $1.04{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents to 5{ cents lower with January at $5.76{ a
bushel.
   Monday's losses erased most of the gains the grain and soybean
markets posted late last week. Selling accelerated after
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the Bush administration
still insists the Soviet Union formally liberalize its emigration
policies before it can be eligible for export credit guarantees.
   Yeutter's statement dashed hopes that a meeting Monday between
Agriculture Department representatives and Soviet officials would
lead to a new grain sales.
   ``I think there was a feeling that with political compromise
over the Soviet stand in the Persian Gulf situation, the United
States would compromise on food credit,'' said William Biedermann,
research director with the Chicago-area commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   Gerald Zusel, a vice president in the grain-trading division of
E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc., said Moscow has relaxed
emigration restrictions unofficially. The impasse over grain sales
to the Soviets is ``like a bad game'' in which U.S. farmers are the
losers because slack export sales mean low prices, he said.
   ``The administration is saying no change in export policy, no
credit. The Russians are saying no credit, we ain't buying,'' Zusel
said.
   Pork futures crashed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, led by
limit losses in the pork-belly market that reflected perceptions
that high prices are stifling retail bacon demand.
   The market got another dose of bearish news after the close when
the USDA released a monthly report that showed a much
higher-than-expected supply of frozen pork bellies.
   The government reported there were 5.5 million pounds of bellies
in the nation's commercial freezers on Oct. 31. Although it was the
second-lowest Oct. 31 stocks figure on record, the number was far
above the average trade estimate of 4.7 million pounds.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Inc., said the
market likely will fall further in the near term, ``but the bottom
line is we still need to put more bellies into storage.''
   Cattle prices firmed as the discount of futures to cash prices
stimulated buying interest on the futures market.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .50 cent higher with
December at 78.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with January at 88.22 cents a pound; live hogs
were .72 cent to 1.43 cents lower with December at 52.02 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.8 cents to the permitted daily
limit of 2 cents lower with February at 69.40 cents a pound.
   Oil futures jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf standoff prompted new
buying.
   Among the factors contributing to war fears were a warning from
Mikhail Gorbachev that Iraq's aggression against Kuwait would be
punished, a call-up of U.S. combat reserves from four states, and
movement toward a United Nations resolution authorizing force to
drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Light, sweet crude oil futures finished 2 cents to $1.56 higher
with January at $32.95 a barrel; heating oil was 2.07 cents to 3.96
cents higher with December at 92.38 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.8 cents to 2.5 cents higher with December at 84.2
cents a gallon.
   Precious metal futures followed the oil markets higher.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $2.20 to $2.40
higher with November at $386.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents
to 2.6 cents higher with December at $4.152 a troy ounce.

   General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft
subsidiary said Monday it has set up a company in Spain to supply
the expanding commercial and industrial markets for electric
components in Europe.
   Hughes said the move will be accompanied by expanded marketing
efforts in Europe, and other new factories are being considered.
   Hughes Microelectronics Europa Espana SA will be built on nine
acres of land in a new industrial park in Malaga, a Mediterranean
seaport that hopes to become a center of technology. By 1994, it
will employ 400 workers, all Spanish and about a quarter of them
engineers, Hughes Aircraft said.
   The Spanish operation is a subsidiary of Hughes'
Microelectronics Europa Ltd. in Scotland, which is part of Hughes'
Torrance-based Industrial Electronics Group.

   Microwave Corp. and AT&amp;T have entered
into an agreement to develop advanced microwave radio products for
use in phone networks and private radio systems, the companies said
Monday.
   The two will develop digital radio products that will use a new
industry standard to send signals through the fiber-optic cables
increasingly used in telephone networks. The new standard is based
on a technology called synchronous digital hierarchy transmission.
   ``Technology which evolves from this joint development effort
will be available to both companies for future products,'' the
announcement said. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Both companies will market the new radio products, with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. concentrating on high-capacity
applications and Digital Microwave on low- to medium-capacity uses.
   Microwave Corp. has had an association with AT&amp;T since 1985.
Under it, AT&amp;T sells Microwave products under the AT&amp;T brand.

<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. demonstrated a computer Monday that
mimics the learning and problem-solving capabilities of the human
brain, and said the machine is the fastest of its type.
   The Japanese computer maker said its so-called neural computer
can carry out 2.3 billion operations per second, the highest
performance ever for such a machine.
   Hitachi demonstrated its computer at a technology fair it put on
for reporters and financial analysts.
   The machine contains 1,152 ``neurons,'' the electronic devices
that act as processors in neural computers.
   Conventional computers need to be given an exact list of
instructions for carrying out a job, but a neural machine can
figure out how to perform a task based on the information given it.
   Neural computers also can reconize patterns. However, neural
machines are poor at numerical calculations, the forte of
conventional computers.
   Hitachi said its machine would be useful for programs such as
signature recognition and predicting stock prices, tasks that
usually would require the power of a large and expensive
supercomputers using conventional technology.
   Though Hitachi's machine is an experimental model, a production
version could be available in Japan in as little as two years, said
Shojiro Asai, deputy director of Hitachi's main research center.
   He said production models would take the form of an attachment
to conventional computer workstations.

<HEAD>Motorola Begins Shipping Advanced Microprocessor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has begun shipping large
quantities of its most advanced computer microprocessor after a
lengthy delay, the company said Monday.
   The chip, unveiled almost two years ago, can execute 20 million
instructions per second. It combines functions that require up to
50 chips in most computers.
   But flaws have plagued the chip, called the 68040, causing
several production delays since it was announced in March 1989. The
announcement beat arch rival Intel Corp.'s unveiling of its
advanced 80486 chip by about a month.
   Intel got its chip on the market last year.
   Murray Goldman, senior vice president of Motorola's
Microprocessor and Memory Technologies Group, blamed the delays on
the chip's complexity. It packs 1.2 million transistors and is
among the fastest chips made.
   The company used the delays to design a chip faster, cheaper and
smaller than its rivals, Goldman said.
   ``It has hurt us that I'm late with the 040,'' Goldman said. ``I
paid a price for doing this. Now, my competitors are going to pay a
price.''
   Motorola switched production of the chip at its plant in Austin,
Texas, on Nov. 16 and began shipping several hundred chips last
week.
   The company hopes to hit peak production of 1,000 chips a week
by January, said Jim Reinhart, marketing manager for the chip line.
   Microprocessors act as the brains, or central processors, of
personal computers.
   Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. lead 36 computer
system and board manufacturers intending to use the 68040 in future
products, Motorola said.
   But one analyst believes the delays in achieving full production
doomed the microprocessor group.
   This is the latest in a long string of similar announcements,
said Rick Whittington, semiconductor analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. in New York.
   ``They went out and ballyhooed this thing a year and a half ago
as the next coming of the Lord, and we've been waiting for it,''
Whittington said. ``Now it's here, we hope, and it's a good thing.
If not, you could pretty well sign that group's death warrant. As
it is, they get a reprieve, but the patient has problems.''
   Jay Samstag, vice president and computer analyst at Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc. in Chicago, disagreed.
   ``It's a lead part, and I'm sure there's other business that
comes along with it, but you have to put that in perspective. They
have a very large product line,'' Samstag said. Motorola stock
closed at $53 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged from
Friday's close.

<TEXT>
   An investor group announced Monday it has withdrawn
its bid to buy Eastern Airlines' Florida and Bahamas commuter
subsidiary, Bar Harbor Airways.
   Jack E. Robinson, a principal of the Miami-based investor group,
BHA Aviation Inc., said the investors and Eastern agreed on the
price, but weren't able to settle on certain contractual
provisions.
   Until recently, Robinson was the president of Bar Harbor, which
operates as Eastern Express.
   Eastern asked for bids on the commuter airline earlier this
fall.
   ``What you've got is a very unique situation. I left Bar Harbor
at end of October, found investors, and we made our bid in early
November to Eastern,'' Robinson said from New York in a telephone
interview. ``Our bid was chosen from among several others as the
most attractive, and we proceeded to negotiations.''
   There was no immediate comment from financially-ailing Eastern,
which plans to return to bankruptcy court in New York on Dec. 3 in
hopes of receiving its second $15 million infusion of operating
capital in three weeks. Calls to Eastern's corporate offices Monday
were not returned.
   Robinson refused to specify what contractual provisions snagged
the BHA offer.
   Bar Harbor has 184 scheduled daily flights serving 20 cities in
Florida and the Bahamas. It is Florida's largest commuter airline,
with hubs in Miami and Tampa.

<TEXT>
   MCA Inc., one of America's most
precious entertainment gems, will be acquired by Japanese business
giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. in a $6.6 billion deal
that firmly establishes Japan's presence in Hollywood moviemaking.
   Even at that huge price tag - the largest ever for a Japanese
purchase of a U.S. company - the deal announced Monday was mildly
disappointing to investors who had been anticipating the purchase
since it was first rumored in September.
   The purchase, which includes Universal Studios, figures out to
about $71 per MCA share. The takeover-starved market had been
hoping for something closer to $90.
   ``I would be happier if it was more, sure. But I'm very happy
with the price,'' said David Geffen, MCA's largest single
shareholder and head of Geffen Records, an MCA subsidiary. Geffen
received his stock when MCA bought his record company last year.
   The deal will bring Geffen more than $700 million.
   But the buyout accomplishes an objective for Matsushita, which
needed the entertainment ``software'' of MCA to complement its
electronics ``hardware.'' The combination mirrors one struck by
Sony Corp., which bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for
$5 billion a year ago.
   With MCA in its fold, Matsushita will try to compete more
effectively against its archrival Sony and shake its image as a
copycat exploiting the technological advances of other companies.
   Matsushita is Japan's largest electronics company and is
familiar to American consumers through brand names such as
Panasonic, Technics and Quasar. MCA, which began 65 years ago as a
booking agent for jazz bands, has grown to become a colossus of
films (``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Back to the
Future''), records (Reba McEntire, Elton John, Guns N' Roses, Bobby
Brown, George Strait) and television (``Murder, She Wrote,''
``Major Dad''). Its Florida and California theme parks are exceeded
only by Disney's.
   ``Software and hardware have been developing simultaneously -
they are like wheels of the same car,'' Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
president, said at company headquarters in Osaka, Japan. ``We
intend that excellent works made by MCA will be distributed all
over the world through a variety of media.''
   Big foreign investments in Hollywood have become a regular
occurrence since Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based News Corp. bought
20th Century Fox in 1985.
   Just this month, MGM-UA Communication Co. was purchased by
Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications for
$1.3 billion. Disney said last month it was launching a partnership
to raise at least $600 million from Japanese investors to make
movies.
   Until the MCA deal, Sony's acquisition of Columbia was the
largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. business. Sony also owns CBS
Records.
   The merged Matsushita and MCA will yield a far larger company.
Their combined revenues in 1990 will be $51 billion, according to
the Value Line Investment Survey. That compares with $27 billion
for Sony-Columbia, and $11 billion for the largest studio-based
U.S. conglomerate, Time-Warner Inc.
   ``This agreement ... will create synergies that neither company
could achieve alone,'' said MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, who is
widely regarded as a leader and mediator for all of Hollywood, not
just MCA.
   MCA President Sidney Sheinberg said the decision to sell MCA was
difficult, but a ``nothing short of a duty'' to shareholders and
employees given the globalization of the marketplace.
   ``They have indicated their respect for our autonomy and
corporate culture,'' Sheinberg said.
   Despite those assurances, the acquisition seems certain to
provide fuel for critics of Japanese investment in the United
States, like the Columbia deal and the recent purchases of real
estate trophies such as Rockefeller Center in New York City and
Pebble Beach in California.
   Matsushita is barred by federal law from owning one key MCA
property, WWOR-TV in the New York area. That station will be spun
off into a separate company with MCA's current shareholders owning
its stock.
   Addressing another sore point, Matsushita said MCA's Curry Co.
subsidiary, which operates restaurants, hotels and other services
in Yosemite National Park, will be sold within a year. Curry is a
tiny though highly profitable fragment of MCA's business. The idea
of it being Japanese-owned produced harsh criticism.
   Complaints go much further. The record producing and composing
legend Quincy Jones, expressing the private fears of many in
Hollywood, said recently that foreigners are being allowed to buy
America's legacy.
   In addition, Jewish groups have protested Matsushita's honoring
of the Arab-sponsored boycott of Israel.
   ``Matsushita's discriminatory policies are not only
reprehensible on ethical grounds but contradict the bedrock
principle of free and open trade between nations,'' the World
Jewish Congress said in a statement Monday.
   Most independent observers say Matsushita knows it is foolish to
meddle with an American success that has never been duplicated
abroad.
   They believe it will follow the lead of Sony, which has lavished
hundreds of millions of dollars on megastars like Michael Jackson
and megaproducers like Peter Guber and Jon Peters, while adopting a
generally hands-off style toward management of its U.S.
entertainment holdings.
   ``It doesn't help them to interfere in the creative process and
interfere in the quality of the product for some philosophical,
political or other purpose,'' said Jeff Logsdon, an entertainment
analyst with Siedler Amdec Securities Inc.
   MCA stockholders will receive $66 per share in cash from
Matsushita, except for the 5 million shares held by Wasserman, who
will get an equivalent amount in preferred stock in a newly
