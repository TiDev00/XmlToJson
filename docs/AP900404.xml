<HEAD>House Passes Aid to Panama, Nicaragua; Senate Expected to Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is turning up pressure on
Congress to quickly enact his aid request for Panama and Nicaragua,
as the House-approved measure faces delay in the Senate.
   The House voted 362-59 Tuesday for a $2.4 billion spending bill
that provides $720 million for the two new Central American
democracies. The measure includes nearly $1.7 billion in other
spending, most of it for domestic programs such as disaster relief,
food stamps and Forest Service firefighting.
   The bill is partly funded by a $1.8 billion cut from the
Pentagon budget that amounts to the first use of a ``peace
dividend'' from lessened East-West military tensions.
   Bush called his appeal a ``laser-like request to help Panama and
Nicaragua,'' and State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said failure to pass the package quickly would threaten the
fledgling democracies and be like ``playing with dynamite.''
   But while the Senate prepares to consider a companion bill
authorizing aid programs for the two countries, it seems in no rush
to take up the money bill itself.
   ``We have a problem lighting a fire under the Senate to move the
bill,'' said a senior administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``There is an alarming lack of enthusiasm
to get this through the Senate.''
   An aide to Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said the senator believes the
administration is sending too much money to Panama and Nicaragua
and not enough to emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   That means Bush's Thursday deadline for passage of the money
bill apparently will not be met, and that the measure will be
before the Senate when Congress returns from its 12-day Easter
recess later this month.
   The administration sent its ambassador to Panama, Deane Hinton,
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday to argue
for the urgency of aid.
   ``That money is desperately needed, and needed now,'' Hinton
said. He said Panama's government is bankrupt and dealing with 30
percent unemployment and that the public has high expectations
following December's U.S. invasion that ousted dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``Investors lack confidence until they see what the United
States is going to do,'' Hinton said.
   In Nicaragua, President-elect Violeta Chamorro will take office
April 25 faced by a litany of immediate problems, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``She will inherit an economy that is bankrupt and a country
that will run out of oil as early as July. Hundreds of thousands of
Nicaraguans will be returning to their country _ former Contras and
their families, demobilized soldiers and refugees from 10 years of
war,'' the State Department spokeswoman said.
   ``Congress must decide whether these Nicaraguans will return as
an army of the unemployed, unable to feed or support their
families, or as citizens of a democracy in which jobs and
opportunities are available,'' she said.
   In the House, the supplemental money bill for the balance of
fiscal 1990 easily survived attempts to strike out or trim foreign
aid sections. But the attempts drew derision from the bill's
supporters.
   ``I am amazed at the number of flat-headed members in this House
who are all too happy to spend whatever it takes'' to support wars
``but wouldn't spend a penny to prevent the necessity to fight
those wars in the first place,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, sought to cut 5 percent from the
foreign aid portions of the bill, charging the measure was
``busting the bank. ... Before we ship money overseas, let's take
care of our own country first.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., countered: ``This amendment shows
why people are fed up with Congress _ because we're looking at the
little bitty `Did I get mine' ... instead of taking care of the
security of our people.''
   The House bill includes Bush's full $300 million request for
Nicaragua. But it trims $80 million from the $500 million he sought
for Panama, diverting $30 million of that to aid African countries,
$20 million to Caribbean nations and $30 million to refugee
programs.

   The debate over tougher air pollution controls
shifts to the House with Senate approval of a sweeping clean air
bill imposing new emission curbs on automobiles, factories and
electric power plants.
   The Senate voted 89-11 late Tuesday to approve a far-reaching
bill aimed at reducing urban smog, toxic industrial chemical
releases and acid rain pollution.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee was working behind
closed doors today on the House version of the bill. A final
committee vote is expected by the end of the week.
   President Bush called the Senate action ``a historic vote'' that
will ``affect generations to come as we work to build a cleaner,
safer America.'' The last time either the Senate or House approved
changes in federal clean air laws was 1977 despite growing concern
in recent years about dirty air.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who
unsuccessfully sought over the past decade to change federal clean
air laws, called the Senate bill ``a tremendous victory'' and a
significant improvement over current air pollution requirements.
   ``We can no longer delay. The American people want action. They
demand action,'' Mitchell said.
   The lopsided Senate voted capped weeks of jockeying among
senators over the legislation, which was a compromise with the
White House.
   Senators from the Northeast and California sought to toughen
auto pollution controls but failed in narrow votes. Several
attempts to cushion the Midwest from the high cost of acid rain
controls also failed, as did an effort to help coal miners who
could lose their jobs under new pollution requirements.
   Many senators expressed concern over the bill's cost, estimated
at about $21 billion a year when it takes full effect toward the
end of the decade.
   Mitchell acknowledged the new emission controls would be
expensive to industry, but he argued ``the costs of inaction will
be higher than the cost of this bill.''
   Health experts estimate air pollution may account for 50,000
premature deaths every year and add $40 billion a year to health
care costs, he said.
   But to many senators, particularly from the Midwest, the vote
represented an agonizing choice between cleaner air and concern
about the measure's impact on employment and electric bills back
home.
   ``This bill will absolutely decimate my state of Illinois,''
declared Democratic Sen. Alan Dixon, whose state has utility plants
that rely on high-sulfur coal as well as miners whose jobs would be
jeopardized by new measures to combat acid rain.
   Dixon was among the 11 senators who voted against the
legislation. Four were from states that would be hard hit by
stringent acid rain control provisions.
   ``I cannot vote for legislation that will destroy the livelihood
of thousands of hard-working men and women ... that will bring
economic ruin to communities throughout Appalachian and Midwestern
states,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who unsuccessfully sought
financial help for coal miners affected by the bill.
   Among key provisions of the bill are:
   _Tighter automobile tailpipe emission controls, requiring that
new cars run cleaner and reduce smog-causing pollutants. Cleaner
fuels would be required for fleets and automobiles in most polluted
cities as well as for urban transit buses.
   _A reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning
utility plants by 10 million tons a year, curbing acid rain.
   _Reductions through the installation of the best available
control technology of toxic chemical releases by industry,
including controls on about 200 chemicals linked to cancer, nervous
disorders and birth defects.
   The bill would require states to implement specific pollution
control plans to clean up urban smog and establish requirements to
cut pollution by 3 percent a year until federal air quality
standards are achieved.
   The timetable for cleaning the air of urban smog ranges from
five years to 15 years for most of the nation's cities. Because of
the severity of its problem, Los Angeles is given 20 years.
   Supporters of the legislation noted government figures that 150
million people breathe dirty air in more than 100 cities from
Lewiston, Maine, to Los Angeles.
   Industrial plants release an estimated 2.7 billion pounds of
toxic chemicals, including carcinogens, into the air each year; and
acid rain pollutants are endangering streams and lakes across much
of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Cries Fowl on Some Duck Labeling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is launching a
quackdown on duck growers who call their birds Long Island
ducklings even when they're raised as far away as Wisconsin or
Pennsylvania.
   The action comes after a five-month investigation into alleged
mislabeling of ducks. It was prompted by a complaint from Rep.
George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., whose eastern Long Island district
includes some of the region's last duck farms.
   ``We're not looking for anything other than fairness,'' Doug
Corwin, a fourth-generation duck farmer, said Tuesday from
Aquebogue, N.Y.
   ``I'm objecting to the bogus address, which gives the
restaurateur or the consumer the misconception he's getting a Long
Island product, which in fact he isn't.''
   On March 21, the Agriculture Department sent letters to five
duck processors telling them it found their labels false or
misleading, said Jim Greene, a spokesman for the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service.
   Department investigators, doing what Greene called basic gumshoe
work, found that some duck farmers' only connection to Long Island
was a post office box. Yet their products carried such labels as
``Pride of Long Island's South Shore'' or ``Genuine Long Island
Distributed Duckling.''
   ``The issue is simply that in order for it to be labeled Long
Island duck or duckling, the animal has to have been raised or
slaughtered on Long Island,'' Greene said.
   He identified the five as: Concord Farms Inc. of Concord, N.C.;
Joe Jurgielewicz &amp; Sons Ltd. of Shartlesville, Pa.; Culver Corp. of
Middlebury, Ind.; Maple Leaf Farms Inc. of Milford, Ind.; and Maple
Leaf Duck Farm Inc. of Franksville, Wis.
   The five have 60 days to respond to the Agriculture Department.
Then, if the ruling becomes final and they continue to put Long
Island labels on their ducks, the agriculture inspector at the
plant won't let the birds off the premises, Greene said.
   Barbara Bender, marketing director for Concord Farms, said
``Long Island duck'' is merely a marketing phrase.
   ``It's not a breed. It's a place,'' she said.
   Even when they sell restaurants North Carolina duck, the
restaurants still list it on the menu as Long Island duckling, she
added.
   But on Long Island, Corwin said the mislabeling has cut into his
market, particularly in places like Florida and Texas.
   ``Our problem comes in markets where we are not well-known,'' he
said. ``Say if we were asked for a bid, we could not outbid a plant
in the Midwest that had lower costs, and yet the bids would specify
genuine Long Island products.''
   Those out-of-state farmers also are trading on Long Island's
reputation for raising leaner, meatier ducks, said Joe Gergela of
the Long Island Farm Bureau.
   Long Island produces about 2 million ducks a year, down from
about 5 million to 6 million 30 years ago, Corwin said. Production
has declined steadily over the years as land development, high
taxes and escalating utility costs squeezed out farmers.
   At one time, Long Island had nearly 100 duck farms. Now there
are about a half-dozen.
   Corwin, whose great-grandfather began raising ducks in 1908,
produces about half the island's annual total.
   ``I'd like to keep growing ducks out here for a few
generations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Angered by a new book picturing Lyndon B.
Johnson as a self-centered politician obsessed with power, admirers
of the 36th president are gathering here this week to celebrate his
``large and generous vision of America.''
   The occasion is a reunion recalling the 25th anniversary of
Johnson's inauguration as an elected president on Jan. 20, 1965.
   On Tuesday, a new 30-minute documentary film,``Lyndon Baines
Johnson: A Remembrance,'' was previewed at the Motion Picture
Association of America theater.
   Produced by Academy Award-winning documentary maker Charles
Guggenheim of Washington, the film presents an image of Johnson
hardly recognizable to readers of ``Means of Ascent,'' the second
volume of Robert Caro's LBJ biography.
   The book portrays Johnson in his youth as willing to do almost
anything to satisfy an all-consuming political ambition. Caro has
said a subsequent volume will show more positive qualities that
Johnson displayed as senator and president.
   The film, made up of black and white still photographs and the
voices of former Johnson associates, concentrates on Johnson's
labors on behalf of civil rights legislation and touches briefly on
the troubles that the war in Vietnam brought to his administration.
   It ends with journalist Bill Moyers, who was one of Johnson's
press secretaries, saying, ``He was many things: proud, sensitive,
impulsive, flamboyant, sentimental, earthy, mean at times, bold,
euphoric, insecure, magnanimous, but temperamental, melancholy, and
strangely ill at ease. He has such a large and generous vision of
America in his best moments as a prosperous, caring, just society.
This was a mind not given to rest, and neither, I think he would
say, should we.''
   On Friday, organizers say approximately 1,000 former White House
staffers, ambassadors, telephone operators and others from the
Johnson White House will gather for a social event to launch a
book, ``LBJ: The White House Years,'' by Harry J. Middleton,
director of the Johnson presidential library, with photographs by
the late White House photographer Yoichi Okamoto.
   ``I find it far more skillful and I think useful than Mr.
Caro's,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America and a former Johnson aide.
   Joseph Califano, a Johnson aide who later became secretary of
health, education and welfare in the Carter administration, asked
to comment on Caro's book, said of Johnson: ``Was he a tough
politician? Sure he was. Could he be a bare-knuckles fighter? Sure.
Were no holds barred? Absolutely. But what is totally missing from
Caro's book is any sense of what drove the man _ of the vision that
he had.''
   The observance is scheduled to wind up Saturday with panels of
journalists discussing ``In Search of LBJ'' under auspices of the
National Press Foundation and the LBJ Foundation, and former
Johnson administration officials discussing ``Social Welfare Issues
from the 1960s to the 1990s.''
   Many of the same group will gather May 5 in Texas for a two-day
seminar at the LBJ Ranch near Johnson City, Texas.

<HEAD>Alleged Killer Bee Not a Major Threat, USDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some Agriculture Department circles the
buzz words these days are Africanized honeybees.
   Not ``killer bees,'' mind you. That's all beeswax dreamed up by
Hollywood and the news media. The USDA has a new ``backgrounder''
report to straighten things out.
   ``Africanized honeybees from Mexico are expected to arrive in
Texas sometime during 1991-92 by natural spread, although some
swarms may arrive sooner,'' the report said.
   The early arrivals could be occasional swarms coming from South
and Central America aboard ships. Those ``are a concern, but they
are not major threats'' to Americans or the U.S. beekeeping
industry, it said.
   Some domestic beekeepers are fearful that the spread of
Africanized bees could jeopardize the U.S. industry, which includes
commercial crop pollination services as well as honey production.
   It has been a long trail for the Africanized honeybees,
descendants of 26 African swarms imported by researchers in Brazil
in 1956 who were trying to develop more productive models than the
traditional European honeybee.
   As the Africanized swarms multiplied and spread into neighboring
South American countries they also marched north across the
continent, gaining an evil reputation. By the early 1980s they were
in Panama, and it was obvious their march would take them into
Mexico and into the United States.
   ``Researchers named them Africanized honeybees,'' the report
said. ``However, as a result of widely publicized stinging
incidents, the name `Killer Bee' was picked up by the movie
industry and the media to describe the Africanized honeybee.''
   The report said everyday risks such as auto accidents ``pose a
much greater risk statistically'' than death from beestings.
   According to routes indicated by the report, the bees are
expected to make their U.S. entry near the southernmost tip of
Texas.
   The Africanized bee is more dangerous than its larger European
cousin, which, incidentally, was introduced into North America by
European settlers. Or maybe it isn't. It depends how many are
involved.
   ``Unlike the docile European honeybees common in the United
States, the Africanized honeybee quickly defends its hive and will
pursue intruders longer distances,'' the report said. ``The venom
from one Africanized honeybee sting is no more potent than the
venom of a single European honeybee sting.''
   One of the widely reported characteristics of the Africanized
bees is their defensive behavior in which hundreds or thousands
quickly and aggressively respond to an intruder, each carrying a
potential sting to the victim.
   ``Even though mass stinging attacks are terrifying and could be
life-threatening, they are not common,'' the report said. ``The
best defense for avoiding stings from all stinging insects _ not
just honeybees _ is common sense.''
   The report added: ``If you find yourself near large numbers of
honeybees, calmly and quickly move away from the area.''

   A government report says northern areas of the
Great Plains still suffer from lack of moisture for crops and
pastures, but farther south the story was too much rain.
   ``Rain improved winter wheat condition in portions of the
central Great Plains'' during the week of March 26-April 1, the
Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday. ``Crop
condition was mostly good in Colorado and Kansas. Nebraska's winter
wheat was fair to good.''
   In the southern plains, too much moisture caused some yellowing
of the wheat crop and hampered fertilizer application. The crop
condition was said to be good to fair in Oklahoma and Missouri.
Rain improved winter wheat in northern Texas but excess moisture
was a problem in some areas.
   ``Winter wheat was mostly good in the Corn Belt and good to fair
in the Southeast,'' the report said. ``Powdery mildew was a
continuing problem in Georgia.''
   In the West, lack of moisture put stress on winter wheat in the
Columbia Basin of Oregon, the report said. Washington's wheat was
in good-to-fair shape, although Russian wheat aphids were a problem
in the eastern part of the state.
   Pastures and livestock were reported in good-to-fair condition
in the Mississippi Delta region and in the East. Ranges in most of
the West needed rain, but livestock was said to be in ``mostly
good' condition.
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.

   Japan has moved ahead of the United States as
the world's largest pork importer, says an Agriculture Department
report.
   The U.S. market share of world pork imports dropped to 28
percent in 1988 from 34 percent in 1985, said the report by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service. Meanwhile, Japan's
import share rose to 28 percent from 18 percent.
   ``For 1989 through 1990, the United States' market share is
forecast to fall, then remain at 25 percent, while Japan's share is
forecast to rise to 31 percent,'' the report said.
   The rise in Japan's pork imports was attributed to ``domestic
pressure calling for greater availability'' and lower prices for
meat. Also, the report cited the government's move to reduce import
levies.

   Two steel companies paid employees' expenses
to travel here, against their union's wishes, to rally against a
clean-air bill that the industry opposes, according to company and
union officials.
   The United Steelworkers of America, which supports the bill,
used memos and telephone calls to try to hold down the size of
Tuesday's demonstration. Members of a Steelworkers local in
Pennsylvania decided not to come because the union leadership
advised against it.
   Still, the demonstration on the Capitol steps was attended by
about 150 workers, many from USX Corp.'s steelmaking plants in
Gary, Ind., and Fairless Hills, Pa., and the company's ore facility
at Mountain Iron, Minn.
   USX paid the expenses of its workers who attended, said
spokesman Ernie Glenn.
   LTV Corp. also sponsored some of its steelworkers from Cleveland
and Warren, Ohio, so they could come, according to spokesman Chuck
Hess.
   ``We look at this as sponsoring a rally for employees who have
expressed concern about this legislation and what it might mean for
them and their families,'' Glenn said. ``I'm not going to comment
on what the international (the union) says or does.''
   When he heard about the rally at the end of last week,
Steelworkers President Lynn Williams sent a memorandum to union
directors nationwide.
   ``The steel companies are attempting to take advantage of our
basic steel local unions by planning an all-expenses, company-paid
rally in Washington,'' the memo said. ``It is not a rally which the
United Steelworkers of America supports. The steel companies are
not themselves opposing the act, but are using our members to front
for them.''
   Charlie Grese, president of the union local at the USX plant in
Clairton, Pa., said in a telephone interview that he changed his
mind about attending after speaking to Williams and other union
officials on the phone.
   ``There's no question we were about ready to come down,'' Grese
said. ``I told the company I would have to take this past the
international union and would not come down without authorization
from the international president.''
   Grese said he decided not to go after being told by the union's
chief lobbyist that the rally would do little good because ``it was
too late to change any minds.'' The Senate approved the bill,
89-11, Tuesday night.
   Demonstrators at the rally opposed a requirement in the bill
that people living near steel plant coke ovens could not be exposed
to a cancer risk of more than one in 10,000 over 70 years.
   The demonstrators expressed concern that such a guideline was
unrealistic, and could force the mandatory shutdown of dozens of
coke ovens. Coke, which comes from coal, is a raw material of
steel. Coke ovens can emit benzene, a carcinogen.
   Billy Gray, a coke oven worker at the Gary plant, said concern
about shutting down coke ovens led him to attend the rally even
though he knew the union leadership backed the legislation. ``It's
a big union, a democratic union,'' he said.
   While the major steel companies oppose the bill, the union says
the measure provides enough time and leeway for steelmakers to
avoid hardships.
   Under the bill, steel producers that make extraordinary efforts
to control leakage from coke ovens would be given until 2020 before
non-complying ovens would be closed.
   The union believes the industry duped workers in ``a crude
campaign of deception'' by making it seem there is a possibility of
``immediate job loss'' from the bill, said union spokesman Gary
Hubbard.

   The jury in John Poindexter's Iran-Contra
trial is being sequestered until it reaches a verdict, after two
members told the judge they were contacted by the news media.
   The panel of eight women and four men was returning to the U.S.
courthouse today to consider the criminal charges against the
former national security adviser.
   Members spent Tuesday night in a hotel after U.S. District Court
Judge Harold Greene ordered them sequestered.
   It was disclosed in court Tuesday that Washington Post reporter
Nora Boustany had telephoned juror Leroy Witherspoon at home after
Monday's first day of deliberations. Witherspoon said he hung up on
her twice.
   Juror William Harris said he was contacted Monday evening by a
woman identifying herself as a reporter. He hung up and she didn't
call back.
   Greene said the ``irresponsible behavior of the press leaves me
no alternative'' but to have the jurors ``taken by the marshals''
to a hotel each night.
   ``I certainly don't want to have a mistrial,'' Greene said.
   Both jurors will remain on the panel because they ``were alert
and intelligent and didn't allow'' any conversation about the case
to take place, said Greene. Poindexter lawyer Richard Beckler said
he had no objection to the two jurors staying on the panel.
   Washington Post editors instructed Boustany to find out how to
get in touch with Witherspoon after the verdict, said Robert
Kaiser, the Post's assistant managing editor for national news.
   ``She did this by calling him up to ask him,'' said Kaiser,
adding that she had made a mistake.
   The judge said the Post's explanation was that the reporter
``just came from Lebanon'' and ``didn't know the rules.''
   Kaiser said the second juror was not contacted by a Post
reporter.
   Also on Tuesday, Greene denied jurors' request for copies of
5,000 messages which were deleted from Poindexter's computer system
days before he resigned. The messages were preserved on a backup
computer tape and some of them have been admitted as evidence.
Many, however, remain highly classified and were not introduced at
the trial.
   The deletion of the computer messages is specified in the
indictment as part of Poindexter's alleged effort to obstruct
Congress on the Iran initiative. Poindexter's lawyers say it was
routine for departing National Security Council employees to purge
their computer systems.
   Poindexter, who was national security adviser to then-President
Reagan from late 1985 to November 1986, is charged with conspiring
to obstruct Congress, two counts of making false statements to
lawmakers and two counts of obstructing congressional inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   He is accused of covering up Oliver North's secret Contra
resupply operation and the U.S. role in a November 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran.

president's bill to improve U.S. schools.
   ``The bottom line is simple _ some people just have a difficult
time giving the president any credit for the efforts and leadership
he has taken in improving and restructuring our nation's schools,''
said Cavazos.
   He chastised the House Education and Labor Committee for not
advancing the administration's $1.5 billion bill to upgrade
education. An alternative offered by Chairman Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., is a ``ploy to sidetrack the president's bill,'' Cavazos
said.
   ``I am disappointed'' that the administration legislation has
been treated ``in a highly partisan fashion,'' Cavazos told the
subcommittee on elementary, secondary, and vocational education.
``It is not a partisan bill _ it is an education reform bill.
   However, many education leaders testified in favor of Hawkins'
bill, including Keith Geiger, president of the National Education
Association; Franklin Smith of the Council of the Great City
Schools; and Gordon Ambach, director of the Council of Chief State
School Officers.
   The subcommittee, however, became embroiled in a partisan war of
words.
   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., who introduced the
administration's bill with 98 cosponsors, complained that the
Democrats' bill was ``177 pages thrown together in two weeks with
not much thought'' and very few details on how various sections
would be implemented.
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., took exception to Cavazos' claim
of partisanship and accused him of ``schizophrenic rhetoric'' that
praises Bush for his educational programs while criticizing the
Democrats for theirs. He also said the president is seeking a 2
percent cut in the education budget.
   Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., estimated that the Democrats'
version would cost $50 billion in five years and said, ``Nobody in
the budget committee could begin to take it seriously.''
   The Senate in early February voted 92-8 to approve and send to
the House the Excellence in Education Act, initially submitted by
Bush last spring.
   The bill seeks to combat drugs in public schools, establish a
presidential merit schools program and increase aid to schools
seeking to reduce dropout rates. One controversial section would
award $25 million in federal funds over three years to the recently
established National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
   Hawkins' bill would increase by $1 billion the authorized amount
for Head Start for fiscal 1991, fully fund the Special Supplemental
Food Program for Women, Infants and Children by 1994 and expand the
Even Start Program. It also would increase aid for dropout
prevention, deterring drug abuse and assisting the handicapped,
illiterate and disadvantaged.
   Ambach of the Council of Chief State School Officers said
Hawkins' bill includes the president's key initiatives, other
congressional initiatives and ``expansion of several current
programs in a comprehensive approach to federal action toward
national priorities and goals for education.''
   Smith, superintendent of the Dayton, Ohio, public schools, said
Hawkins' bill ``pays particular attention to balancing the twin
concerns of excellence and equity, issues that are of vital
interest to urban schools and the children they must serve.''
   But Lawrence Patrick Jr., president of the Detroit Board of
Education, testified that with passage of the administration's
bill, ``we truly believe we can become a significant point of light
_ an urban star shining bright _ illuminating successful quality
educational reform across the nation.''

<HEAD>Administration Considering Cutback in Stealth Bomber Production</HEAD>

   The Bush administration, facing growing
congressional opposition to the costly B-2 stealth bomber, is
weighing plans to scale back production of the aircraft, says Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice.
   In his first public comments on the Pentagon's review of major
weapons systems, Rice said the Defense Department is examining
other options to the current plan to buy 132 bombers at a cost of
more than $70 billion.
   ``We think there are some alternate profiles ... with some very
modest effect on the total cost of the program,'' Rice told the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense Tuesday.
   Major concerns in the Pentagon center on the possibility that
purchasing less than the full fleet will force up the cost of a
single, radar-evading bomber, now estimated at about $530 million.
   Rice said pending legislation that would stop production at the
15 bombers currently being built would mean a total program cost of
$33 billion to $34 billion. Based on those numbers, a single plane
would cost more than $2 billion, he noted.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has been reviewing the
alternatives, Rice said. The Air Force has scheduled another
briefing for the Pentagon chief on the B-2 on Thursday.
   President Bush's $307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, calls for $5.5 billion for the stealth bomber
program, including the purchase of five planes and other expenses.
   But in the mid-1990s, the administration is projecting purchases
of 10 planes and later 24 in a single year with annual costs of
nearly $10 billion.
   Rice said the most efficient production rate for the plane's
manufacturer, Northrop Corp., is 29 planes a year. But the Air
Force secretary conceded that it will be difficult to persuade
Congress to spend almost $10 billion a year on a single weapons
program.
   Pressed for the options the Pentagon is weighing, Rice said: ``I
can't give numbers except to say several billion dollars a year
less than peak funding level'' of close to $10 billion.
   ``It would inevitably get up to a lower production rate on the
order of two-thirds, perhaps three-fourths what had been peak
rate,'' Rice said in reference to the 29 bombers a year.
   Democrats and Republicans on the panel made it clear that the
B-2 program, for which the government has invested more than $23
billion, faces an uphill fight in Congress.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., a proponent of the stealth bomber,
questioned Rice on the alternatives to the full fleet of 132
bombers _ a total that many lawmakers say is unlikely.
   ``I'm trying to help you guys with this weapons system,'' Kasten
said. ``Today it's hard to help.''
   The ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska, wondered whether the Air Force had considered abandoning
the next generation of programs such as the B-2 bomber, the C-17
cargo plane and the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   Stevens said several of his colleagues were thinking about
sticking with the weapons and planes currently in use and looking
ahead several generations to other programs.
   ``We have a lot of back-burner people on this committee,''
Stevens said of his colleagues who want to set aside the Air
Force's high-tech programs. ``You know it and we know it.''

<HEAD>Target Prices Must be Tied to Production Costs, Senators Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If Americans are to continue paying less for
food than anyone else in the world, target prices set by the
government for crops must be tied to production costs, say five
senators working on the price-support section of the 1990 farm bill.
   ``U.S. consumers today spend just 10.4 percent of their
disposable income on food, the lowest level in history and less
than consumers in any other country,'' Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb.,
said Tuesday.
   But ``the producer's share of each dollar spent on food has
dropped to an all-time low,'' he said at a news conference called
to outline legislation expected to be the basis of the target price
and income support section of the Senate farm bill.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, a House subcommittee approved a dairy program
for the House version of the massive legislation that Congress
designs every five years to set agriculture policy.
   Under the House dairy program, the government would buy up to 7
billion pounds of milk products, at $10.60 per hundred pounds, if
they can't be sold on the open market. Farmers who produce more
than their share of the government's limit would get a sharply
lower amount.
   The key to the legislation is reducing butter production which,
because of low consumer demand, is ending up in government
warehouses.
   The Senate has not yet acted on dairy.
   Kerrey was joined by Sens. James Exon, D-Neb.; Tom Daschle,
D-S.D.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., to push for
raising target prices on so-called program crops _ wheat, corn,
cotton, soybeans and rice.
   The legislation would cost about $12 billion annually, said
Kerrey, who has led the fight against a Bush administration
proposal designed to lower target prices.
   The government sets target prices to assure farmers a certain
income. If the market price does not reach the target price, the
government pays the farmer the difference.
   The senators said their plan would protect family farms, which
an aide to Daschle, Mark Ulven,said was important as a guard
against higher supermarket prices. If agricultural production were
in the hands of just a few corporate farms, food prices would also
be under their control, he said.
   Kerrey said the plan's aim is not to heavily subsidize farmers.
He said the Democrats are interested in seeing farmers produce for
the market, not government subsidies.
   But, he said, ``recovery is fragile,'' and the government should
assure that farmers' production costs are covered.
   Provisions in the proposed legislation include:
   _Tying target prices to increased production costs.
   _Raising loan rates, which help determine market prices, by more
than 20 percent next year, and setting a floor on the loan rate of
$2.10 for corn and $2.75 for wheat.
   _Establishing a normal crop acreage base for each farm that is
the total of the farm's current crop-specific bases, plus the
average acreage planted to soybeans during the last five years.
   _Raising income support levels on oilseeds, oats and barley to
levels comparable with wheat and corn.

<HEAD>Homosexuals on News Staffs Decry Their Papers' Coverage of Gay
Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first survey of its kind, homosexual
members of the staffs of American newspapers say their papers do a
poor job in the way they treat news about gays or of concern to
them.
   The gay journalists said their papers treat them fairly and give
them opportunity to advance, but rarely call on their insights into
gay lifestyles in the same way black reporters are asked to help
guide coverage of black issues.
   And some newsrooms ``harbor a palpable undercurrent of bias,'' a
summary of the findings concludes. One respondent commented that
her colleagues who ``make snide homophobic comments and jokes'' are
``the same people who write those sensitive stories and
editorials!''
   The survey was being made public today at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. It was undertaken in
response to outgoing ASNE President Loren Ghiglione, who asked
whether ``anti-gay discrimination infects today's newsrooms.''
   When word circulated that the survey was to be undertaken, 205
homosexual members of the staffs of U.S. newspapers volunteered to
respond. Three-fifths said they were openly gay, and two-thirds
signed their questionnaires.
   Ninety-two percent said they knew other people on the staff who
were gay and the majority of them estimated that fewer than 20
percent of the homosexuals on their papers were openly gay.
   Many experts estimate that one American in 10 is gay.
   ``Why does it matter?'' asked Leroy F. Aarons, an executive of
the Oakland (Calif.) Tribune who coordinated the project. He said
the subject is important because ``more than ever before, editors
are grappling with a swirl of social and political currents around
alternative lifestyle issues.''
   ``Domestic partners legislation, gay adoption,
anti-discrimination laws, fundamentalist attacks on the gay
lifestyle, morality and public responsibility and, of course, the
still-raging AIDS epidemic have brought once-easily ignored issues
into demanding focus,'' he said.
   The respondents gave especially low ratings to the way their
papers treated gay lifestyles, community events and politics and
only slightly better ratings to treatment of violence against gays,
civil rights issues and legislation.
   As for terminology, nearly a third said they found the term
``homosexual'' to be prejudiced, explaining that it refers narrowly
to sex whereas the term ``gay'' refers to lifestyles or issues.
   Another report at the meeting looked at what happens to
newspapers when they are taken over by non-local ownership. A
majority of the editors said firms owning multiple newspapers are
more interested in profits than in the communities they serve and
that freedom of the press is in more jeopardy when the ownership of
papers is concentrated in fewer hands.
   Some editors said that group ownership was likely to enrich a
local paper because the group brought greater resources to it; some
said group ownership led to homogenization.
   Editors of 234 newspapers, half group-owned and half
independent, took part.
   The report noted that 50 years ago, there were 1,559
independent, locally owned dailies and only 319 under group
ownership, but now there are only 389 independents and 1,233
group-owned papers.
   Group-owned papers, the report said, were likely to offer
``better career opportunities, more sharing of ideas, less pressure
from advertisers and special interest groups, greater overall
financial resources and access to outside experts to help solve
problems and train staff.''
   Independent papers, on the other hand, were likely to offer
``larger newsroom budgets, better understanding of (the) local
market, more flexibility in making decisions, greater involvement
in the community, less turnover of key personnel, few levels of
bureaucracy and a tendency to be peculiar.''
   The ASNE's annual survey of minority employment on newspapers
showed that 7.86 percent of newsroom editors, reporters and
photographers were members of racial minorities _ a scant increase
from last year's 7.54 percent.
   When the survey started in 1978, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
American Indians constituted 3.95 percent of the news staffs. The
figure has risen gradually each year.
   ``In these tough economic times, perhaps any increase in the
percentage of people of color should be applauded,'' said Ghiglione
said.
   But Merv Aubespin, chairman of the ASNE Minorities Committee,
said the slight gain was ``embarrassing for our industry, which
prides itself on putting the spotlight on the ills of society.''
   The survey said minorities make up 4.6 percent of newsroom
supervisors, 8 percent of copy editors, 8.7 percent of reporters
and 10.7 percent of photographers.

<HEAD>1.5 Million Households Didn't Get Census Forms Because of Foul-up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 1.5 million households nationwide
received no census forms because the Census Bureau failed to print
post office box numbers on the mailings, officials said.
   Each form will have to be delivered by census workers to the
homes, instead of to the boxes, before the census can be completed,
Gail Kremenec, spokeswoman for the regional census office in the
Chicago suburb of Westchester, said Tuesday.
   Officials were unable to estimate the cost of the foul-up but
said they don't expect any significant delay in completing the 1990
census.
   About 106 million forms were mailed nationwide in the last week
of March. But forms destined for people who have their mail sent to
box numbers went out without the numbers, and the Postal Service
was unable to deliver them, census officials said.
   ``We're getting them back by the mailbag. It's pretty widespread
across the country, rural and urban areas. I think we've gotten
back about all we're going to get,'' said Judith Petty, chief of
the census processing staff in Jeffersonville, Ind.
   The Jeffersonville office is the clearinghouse for all
undelivered census forms.
   Ms. Petty said each bag must be sorted by hand and the forms
redistributed to district offices so they can be delivered by
census workers.
   ``I've got about 30,000 forms to hand-deliver,'' said Don
Leadill, manager of the Census Bureau's Peoria office.
   The Postal Service checked the Census Bureau's mailing lists
before distributing the forms, but the post office box problem was
not discovered because addresses with box numbers weren't checked,
Ms. Kremenec said.
   Ms. Kremenec said census employees hired to do door-to-door
surveys next month will be pressed into service to deliver the
forms. ``We already have the staff on board to go to every house
that we didn't get a response from,'' she said.
   However, in at least two central Illinois districts extra census
employees will have to be hired, at $6 per hour, to deliver the
forms. Leadill said he will hire people for the task, as will Jerry
Harder, district manager in Bloomington.
   ``We have about 15,000 forms being returned to us as
undeliverable,'' said Harder, whose largely rural district includes
13 counties. But he said, ``We don't consider it a big problem. ...
It's no big deal.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Hits the Hot Dog Circuit for Fellow
Republicans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is planting saplings and
shaking money trees as he travels a transcontinental $1,000-hot-dog
circuit to raise cash for fellow Republicans.
   ``I am president at a fascinating time. We are Republicans at a
fascinating time,'' Bush tells audiences of contributors who have
paid a grand apiece _ sometimes for no more than a frankfurter _ to
see him in person.
   For a handshake and a photograph and perhaps a few personal
words from the chief executive, the price of admission rises to
$5,000.
   Although Bush may have what Texas GOP gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams calls ``wonderful coattails,'' his main help to
candidates this early in the election cycle is as a drawing card to
help fill campaign war chests.
   And with his high ratings in the public opinion polls, Bush's
success at bringing in the green is all but unsurpassed. His stops
this week for candidates in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan raised about
$1 million per stop.
   Consequently, Bush, a former Republican National Committee
chairman, plans to do more fund raising for other candidates than
any president in history, White House aides say.
   White House political operatives and the RNC so far have blocked
out 25 days of political travel for the president through the end
of August.
   ``That's really 50 events, since we try to do two every day,''
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   And that doesn't take into account September and October, when
campaigns really heat up and when Bush will be on the campaign
trail almost constantly, Ms. Glen said.
   Bush will campaign for at least 15 GOP Senate candidates and 16
GOP gubernatorial candidates, Ms. Glen said. The president will
leave most House candidates to Vice President Dan Quayle and
members of the Cabinet, but will do some campaigning in key
congressional races, she said.
   The president uses events like Tuesday's tree-planting ceremony
in a downtown Indianapolis park to help defray the costs to
candidates and to state GOP parties.
   Taxpayers pick up part of the tab when the president includes a
non-political event with a campaign stop.
   ``You know, two weeks ago I told an audience that I'd been
planting so many trees all over the country that I might have to
open a branch office,'' he told the Indianapolis audience, which
groaned in unison at his pun.
   ``I knew it,'' he said. ``I tried it once before and got the
same groan. This one is going out of the speech from now and
evermore.''
   At a fund-raiser Monday night in Cincinnati for GOP
gubernatorial candidate George Voinovich, a dance band with an
accordion struck up ``Hail to the Chief'' and somehow made it sound
like a polka.
   Now, it isn't often that you hear ``Hail to the Chief,'' the
presidential march, on an accordion. But it's one of the things a
president has to get used to when he's out on the campaign trail.
   Wealthy Cincinnati Republicans in expensive suits, furs and
diamond jewelry stood around stuffing dripping chili dogs into
their mouths and straining to catch a glimpse of Bush.
   Most seemed delighted to be there, although some grumbled
quietly about the food. Even the president seemed apologetic.
``These are the most expensive hot dogs in the state of Ohio,'' he
exclaimed.
   Although usually the food fare is more upscale than hot dogs,
the fund-raisers basically follow the same formula: $1,000 for the
basic ticket, $5,000 for a more intimate ``grip and grin'' session
that either precedes or follows the main event.
   The fund-raisers all contain a standard stump speech by the
president _ praising the local candidate, praising the state,
saying a particular race ``will be among the most crucial in
America,'' saluting the nearest major league baseball team and
remarking on pro-democracy changes in the world.
   ``Opportunity ... is the freedom to root for the team of your
choice, to vote for the candidate of your choice, or to eat the
vegetable of your choice,'' he told a fund-raiser in Dearborn,
Mich., Tuesday night.
   Bush also bashes Democrats in each speech _ a guaranteed
crowd-pleaser.
   There's another part of the formula that Bush follows at all the
fund-raising luncheons, banquets and hot dog fests.
   He never eats. Instead, he usually tries to sneak out afterward
and sample a local restaurant.

   Gold whose value skyrocketed as it sat on
the sea bottom for 133 years has lured Columbia University into a
court battle over the wreck of the SS Central America.
   The trial that opened Tuesday originally pitted the
Columbus-America Discovery Group, a group of 100 investors with
exclusive rights to search the ocean bottom for the wreck, and the
45 companies who claim ties to the ship's original insurers.
   But it was complicated by an announcement that Columbia was
entering the fray. The Ivy League university contends one of its
researchers provided data used to locate the gold-laden wreck that
is valued at $450 million to $1 billion.
   The exact location of the ship, which sank in 1857 about 160
miles off Charleston, S.C., is contained in files sealed by U.S.
District Judge Richard B. Kellam.
   Columbia's attorneys maintain a 1984 sonar survey by Dr. William
Ryan, a Columbia oceanographer, was the basis for the wreck's
discovery. That survey was funded by Harry John, who once held 47
percent of the stock in Miller Brewing Co., and Jack Grimm, a Texas
oilman.
   According to the school, Ryan later shared the data with Thomas
G. Thompson, president of Columbus-America, without realizing
Thompson would use the material for his own ends.
   Thompson and his company recovered a ton of gold from the wreck
last summer. Company officials believe two tons remain.
   Thompson agrees that the wreck was located near the point Ryan's
data would indicate but denies Ryan's data was used to locate it.
   Richard T. Robol, an attorney for Columbus-America, an
Ohio-based company, described the university's claim this way:
``It's a lot like an astronomer taking a picture of the sky. That
picture might contain an unknown planet, but the astronomer never
sees it. Then, 30 years later, after exhaustive research, a second
astronomer identifies the unknown planet, and the first tries to
claim he found it 30 years earlier.''
   Columbus-America officials say Columbia in any case lacks the
equipment to excavate the wreck, which lies 1{ miles down.
   Before Columbia stepped in, the trial was a simple matter over
whether the wreck had been abandoned. The insurance companies
contended that although their corporate predecessors paid off $1.2
million in claims for the disaster, they never abandoned claims to
the gold.
   Attorneys for Columbus-America argued that the companies did not
own the treasure just because they insured it.
   The SS Central America ran into a hurricane and sank on Sept.
12, 1857, as it sailed to New York from California. Reports at the
time put the number of dead at between 362 and 423 of the 578
people on board.
   Among the cargo were three tons of gold bars and freshly minted
``double eagle'' gold coins from the San Francisco mint. That gold
was worth $1.6 million at the time and would be worth about $450
million at today's prices.
   In addition, many passengers were carrying fortunes they had
made in California, and Columbus-America officials believe the
total treasure could be worth up to $1 billion.
   The gold recovered last summer is being held by U.S. marshals in
an undisclosed location.

   Housing prices in Palm Beach, Fla., shot up
24.1 percent in the last year, making it the fastest-rising housing
market in the country, says U.S. News &amp; World Report.
   In this week's issue, the magazine lists the 25 U.S.
metropolitan areas where median prices for existing homes climbed
by the greatest percentages between the first quarter of 1989 and
the first quarter of 1990.
   Akron, Ohio, where prices were up 22 percent, was second,
followed by Greenville, S.C., Mobile, Ala., and Sacramento, Calif.
   The survey, carried out with the WEFA Group, a consulting firm
based in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., found that the estimated median price
for homes in the West Palm Beach metropolitan area was $117,183 in
the first three months of this year compared to $94,400 a year
earlier.
   The hottest housing markets are not necessarily the most
expensive. In Akron, even after the 22 percent jump, the median
home price was estimated at $68,314, well below the national median
of $93,100.
   The magazine survey also tracked the nation's coolest housing
markets, topped by Youngstown, Ohio. Median prices there dropped
12.6 percent in the past year.
   Here are the magazine's top 25 markets, with median price for
existing homes in the first quarter of 1990 and percentage increase
from a year earlier.
   1. West Palm Beach, Fla., $117,183, 24.1 percent
   2. Akron, Ohio, $68,314, 22.0.
   3. Greenville, S.C., $73,403, 20.7.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms Restrictions on `Baby Bells'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals says it agrees with
a lower court that the seven Bell operating companies cannot enter
the long-distance or telephone equipment businesses.
   However, Tuesday's ruling reopens the possibility that the
so-called Baby Bells can sell electronic information services to
homes and offices.
   The decision means that U.S. District Judge Harold Greene must
consider anew whether the Bell companies may be allowed to develop
so-called ``electronic Yellow Pages,'' allowing consumers to shop
and bank _ among other possibilities _ via cheap, easy-to-use video
terminals.
   A prototype system in France, called Minitel, already serves 5
million homes and offices and offers 8,000 different services.
   The three-judge appeals panel found that Greene ruled correctly
when, in his 1987 ``triennial review'' of the American Telephone
and Telegraph Co. antitrust settlement, he sustained the original
order barring the seven spinoff companies from competing with their
one-time parent in the long-distance and telephone manufacturing
arenas.
   But appeals judges Abner Mikva, Harry Edwards and Laurence
Silberman faulted Greene's legal reasoning when, as part of that
same review, he only partially opened the door for the operating
companies to expand into computer-based information services.
   Greene allowed the Bell companies to offer computer gateways and
access menus for databases and services offered by other firms _
but not to generate those services themselves. That precluded them
from pursuing a U.S. version of France's government-operated
Minitel system.
   Kenneth Pitt, media relations director of Bell Atlantic,
expressed excitement over the appellate ruling, though he conceded
Greene could still rule against the Bell companies offering a
variety of prospective services that include banking, home
shopping, news, real estate listings, and medical monitoring.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders Speedier Schedule for Harris Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered
speeded-up handling of the case of Robert Alton Harris, who would
have been the first person executed in California in 23 years if
not for a reprieve.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday voted 6-3 to leave intact a
stay of execution issued by a lower court. That prompted
predictions from prosecutors that the case would sit for months in
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   But before Attorney General John Van de Kamp could request
quicker handling of the case, the appeals court Tuesday ordered it.
   The first written arguments from Harris' lawyers, normally due
in 40 days, must be submitted by April 13. Remaining briefs from
both sides will get an additional 17 days rather than 44, and the
hearing is two weeks later, May 14.
   No deadline is set for the court to make its ruling.
   The panel consists of Judge John Noonan, who issued the order
last Friday blocking Harris' execution, and Judges Arthur Alarcon
and Melvin Brunetti.
   Harris, 37, convicted of the 1978 murders of two San Diego
teen-agers, stood to become the first person executed in California
since 1967.
   He has come within four days of execution twice _ in 1982 and
again Friday, when Noonan granted on stay to consider whether
Harris received competent psychiatric assistance at his trial.
   Hours after he was to have been executed at 3 a.m. Tuesday,
Harris was removed from a special cell near the San Quentin gas
chamber and returned to death row.
   Noonan's stay of execution centered on whether the psychiatrists
hired by Harris' lawyer at his 1979 trial should have tested him
for brain damage or other mental disorders.
   A psychiatrist and psychologist retained by current defense
lawyers found brain damage, symptoms of fetal alcohol effect and
other disorders and concluded that the previous experts were
incompetent for failing to test for those problems.
   Van de Kamp contends the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 1985 ruling on
the issue, did not intended to allow a newly hired psychiatrist to
evaluate the work of earlier experts. Noonan's order would also
open the door to a wave of attacks on cases in which the
defendant's mental state was at issue, Van de Kamp said.

   Divorced people go to the altar at higher
rates than single folks, a new government report says.
   There were 807 marriages for every 10,000 divorced women in
1987, the National Center for Health Statistics reported. That
compared to 589 marriages per 10,000 single women.
   Among men, the marriage rate was 1,157 per 10,000 divorced men,
compared to 488 for single ones, the center said.
   Marriages involving single women and divorced men increased from
6.9 percent of all marriages in 1970 to 11.0 percent in 1987. Those
involving single men and previously divorced women rose from 6.4
percent to 10.4 percent of marriages over the same period.
   And over that time span, marriages involving two previously
divorced people rose from 10.7 percent to 19.1 percent of marriages
across the country.
   Even though the figures are for 1987, that is the most current
detailed information on marriages.

<HEAD>Foley Says He Would Vote Against Flag-Protecting Constitutional</HEAD>

   Amendment
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley says he will
vote against a constitutional amendment to protect the flag if the
Supreme Court throws out the federal law against flag burning.
   By tradition, the Speaker of the House rarely votes and Foley
has not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago. But Foley
said he would come off the speaker's podium and vote ``no'' if the
House considered a constitutional amendment.
   Foley last year supported passage of the law against flag
burning. But he said amending the Constitution, and especially the
First Amendment definition of ``elemental freedoms of this
country,'' was not justified.
   The First Amendment ``is the most sacred part of the
constitutional document, and to amend it for these reasons would be
extraordinarily unwise,'' Foley said. ``I think the judgment of
history would be unkind on the Congress or the state legislatures
if that were to occur.''
   The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for May 14 on
whether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that the
flag burning statute passed by Congress last year is
unconstitutional.
   Foley has promised a House vote on a constitutional amendment
within 30 days if the court rules against the statute.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Justice Unit Will Review Findings of Gray Leak</HEAD>

</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says he will
direct the Justice Department's internal disciplinary unit to
review the results of an FBI leak investigation.
   Thornburgh said Tuesday the Office of Professional
Responsibility will review the inconclusive results of an FBI
inquiry into leaks about a criminal investigation involving alleged
financial irregularities in the office of Rep. William Gray III,
D-Pa.
   The leak to CBS News _ at a crucial time while Gray was running
for House majority whip last spring _ produced a storm of criticism
from Democrats on Capitol Hill who charged it was politically
inspired.
   It forced the Justice Department to take the unusual step of
saying that Gray was not a target of the investigation, and that he
was cooperating with the FBI.
   The extensive leak investigation ordered by Thornburgh failed to
identify the source with certainty.
   The attorney general's decision in December not to refer the
matter to the OPR for possible disciplinary action was criticized
by several lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   At a hearing of the panel Tuesday, Thornburgh told Biden that he
would ask OPR to review the report produced by the FBI
investigation.

<HEAD>Richards Camp to White: No Apologies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ann Richards is offering no apologies for
her campaign tactics after former Gov. Mark White likened her
behavior to that of Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler.
   Stopping short of endorsing Attorney General Jim Mattox over Ms.
Richards in the April 10 Democratic runoff for governor, White on
Tuesday said he would vote in that race _ but not for Ms. Richards.
   ``I will never endorse Ann Richards. I will never support Ann
Richards. And I will never vote for Ann Richards,'' said White,
whose comeback bid collapsed when he finished a distant third in
last month's Democratic primary.
   ``I've always thought he (Mattox) was one of the toughest
campaigners I've ever seen, but what Ann Richards has done would
make Himmler blush,'' White said.
   During a campaign stop in San Benito, Ms. Richards said: ``Well,
that's too bad. ... I really don't think that it's like Mark White
to call anyone a Nazi.''
   The Republican nominee for governor, oilman Clayton Williams,
had courted White, hoping to win the ex-governor's endorsement.
Williams' press secretary, Bill Kenyon, said:
   ``We're happy with the governor's statement. We think it
illustrates that moderate-to-conservative Democrats have no real
choice in this runoff and the general election we believe that they
will be attracted to Clayton Williams.''
   White criticized Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, for TV
commercials and speeches in which she alleged that he had profited
from public service and helped his old law firm obtain state bond
business while he was governor.
   White said Ms. Richards ``willfully and knowingly smeared me
with false accusations that she knew at the time to be untrue.''
   ``She didn't do it just once in the heat of an argument. She did
it with inexcusable regularity in the last days of the campaign,''
White.
   Ms. Richards' campaign manager, Glenn Smith, said the campaign
stands by its TV commercials critical of White.
   ``Ann Richards fulfilled the pledge she made when she announced
her candidacy _ she said she would run a positive campaign until
she was attacked _ and she was, by both her opponents,'' Smith
said. ``Like all of us, Mr. White should support any candidate he
chooses, and I'm sure he'll let his conscience be his guide.''
   Meanwhile, Mattox charged Tuesday that he has signed statements
from witnesses alleging Ms. Richards has used illegal drugs in the
past 10 years. He faced three reporters alone because Ms. Richards
declined to attend the debate, citing a previous commitment.
   Mattox said he has ``proof from the perspective of individuals
that have said to me that Ann Richards has used certain drugs.''
Mattox refused to identify his informants.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has been under fire for
weeks for refusing to say whether she ever used illegal drugs. She
has said only that she has not used any ``mood-altering'' drugs in
10 years.

<HEAD>Employers View Child Labor Violations as Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Deparment's crackdown on child labor law violations
was called ``nitpicking'' by one businessman and criticized by
others who said it contradicted the government's goal of finding
jobs for teen-agers.
   Nearly $3 million in fines have been levied on fast-food
restaurants and other businesses for nearly 11,000 violations cited
in a three-day federal sweep, Labor Department officials said
Tuesday.
   Most of the violations involved teen-agers working more hours or
later hours during the school week than is allowed under federal
law. Others were illegally employed in dangerous jobs, such as
using power-driven meat slicers, dough mixers and paper balers, the
department said.
   Most of the companies fined agreed violations had occurred but
said they were petty and unavoidable.
   The crackdown seemed to contradict Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole's recently expressed concern about jobs for youngsters, said
Deborah Jackson, president of Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries
Inc., a Boston affiliate of Goodwill that was fined $6,000 for
various violations.
   ``On the one hand the DOL is citing an organization as fine as
Goodwill and on the other hand Elizabeth Dole is making a
statement, and the two don't seem to be in concert,'' Jackson said.
   One of the violations charged that youths illegally packaged
plastic toys in boxes, she said.
   ``If not this kind of job, I'm not sure how they intend to
provide opportunities,'' she said. ``Frankly, the job's safe enough
for my 9-year-old.''
   Reams food stores in Utah were fined about $20,000 for
violations involving about 80 youngsters.
   ``The violations were not flagrant at all. In most cases, they
involved kids working 10 minutes beyond their three hours,'' said
general manager Dick Cheney. ``We feel that we've obeyed the spirit
of the law, and that they're nitpicking. They're on some kind of
crusade.''
   Dozens of companies were listed from around the country,
including individual restaurants that are part of the McDonald's,
Taco Bell, Jack in the Box and Burger King chains.
   Nearly half the fast-food restaurants and other businesses
targeted in the sweep were found to be employing children
illegally, said William Brooks, an assistant labor secretary. Of
the 3,776 firms investigated, violations were found at 1,750, he
said.
   The largest fine, $29,050, was levied against GFF Foods, a
Moore, Okla., supermarket where juveniles operated a paper-baler,
used to smash cardboard boxes.
   Gary Pierson, an attorney for store owner Truman Talley, said,
``I don't believe my client had any intent to do anything illegal
or to risk the health of any employees.''
   Mike Doty, a 19-year-old deli employee at GFF who has worked at
groceries since he was 14, said the store seemed strict about use
of hazardous machinery.
   ``The box crusher has signs all over it saying anyone under 18
is not supposed to use it, and here they keep a pretty close eye on
it,'' he said.
   Dole defended the crackdown, saying new findings reinforce ``our
belief that the trend toward violations is growing.''
   Companies have the right to appeal the fines they think are
unfair.
   Federal law forbids 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than
three hours on a school day or 18 hours a week during the school
year. Eight hours are permitted on weekend days and 40-hour weeks
are permitted in summer and during vacations.

   Life choices are limited in this
small, dusty town, and Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez was among the
young people who looked to the United States for a better future.
   For Marquez, 24, the immigrant's dream of prosperity ended on
March 25 in a fire at the Happy Land Social Club in New York City.
He and six other young Hondurans were buried this week in El
Progreso, a town of 30,000.
   They were among 87 people killed in the fire. At least 78 were
Hondurans, most from the northern Atlantic coast region.
   The local victims came from poor families and had few choices: a
lowly job at one of the U.S. fruit companies that made Honduras the
original ``banana republic''; a dead-end job in San Pedro Sula, a
coastal industrial center of 600,000 people; or immigration to New
York, a promised land of jobs, education and opportunity.
   Marquez left six years ago.
   ``He wrote me last month,'' said Gregorio Hernandez, his uncle.
``He had gotten his high school equivalency diploma; he was
applying to go to college.''
   Meanwhile, Marquez worked at a factory, cutting leather to make
clothing, handbags and shoes. Even at minimum wage, he earned
enough to survive and send money home to his mother.
   ``I wrote him back,'' Hernandez said. ``I said: Become a
professional. A professional never goes hungry. A professional
lands on his feet anywhere life throws him.''
   Hernandez was the first person in his family of nine children to
finish high school. ``My three older brothers only finished the
eighth grade because back then there wasn't a high school here and
my father didn't have the money to send them to San Pedro Sula,''
Hernandez said.
   The brothers worked for the Tela Railroad Co., a subsidiary of
Chiquita Brands, which has extensive banana plantations in Honduras.
   Hernandez became a supervisor at a textile factory in San Pedro
Sula and assumed the leadership of the extended family because of
his education and job in the big city.
   Wanting something better for his own children and those of his
brothers and sisters, he sent his daughter and Marquez to New York
to live with relatives.
   ``He never once failed with his monthly money for his mother and
his brothers and sister,'' said Hernandez.
   When Marquez's older sister, one of four children, started
college in San Pedro Sula, Marquez sent her a new typewriter. When
he came home for Christmas, he brought gifts: a book for an aunt,
sunglasses for his twin younger brothers, a small stereo for the
family and money for his mother, who has been separated from his
father for years.
   ``He was her sole support,'' said Hernandez.
   Marquez's Christmas visit was the first since he left El
Progreso.
   Last Sunday, he returned in a slate-blue coffin on a Red Cross
charter jet that carried the bodies of 47 other Hondurans as well.
   The Hernandez clan and neighborhood friends met him, as they had
at Christmas.
   ``We've had to borrow money to pay for the funeral and the plot
in the cemetery, about 1,200 lempiras ($300),'' said Hernandez.
``We're not rich, but we had to give him a proper burial.''
   At the crowded cemetery in El Progreso, a boyhood friend, Jose
Cardenas, 24, perched on one of the simple, cement-covered graves
painted pink, blue and white and overrun with weeds and dust from
unpaved streets.
   Cardenas had also gone to New York, but was deported last year
as an illegal alien.
   ``Leaving here for New York is a change of life for the better,
because there is nothing here,'' he said as Marquez's funeral
procession arrived.
   ``You stay here and do this,'' he said, pointing to a rag-clad
grave digger, ``or you go to New York.''

   He was impish, indignant, humorous,
uncompromising and, of course, long on words _ another typical
evening for President Fidel Castro.
   And his message was clear: Cuba's revolution, at age 31, is
stronger than ever, thanks in no small measure to the patriotic
feelings stirred up by TV Marti transmissions by the United States.
   The scene was Tuesday night at the Palace of Conventions, where
Castro regaled more than 200 foreign and local journalists for more
than two hours. He held their attention throughout and was mobbed
afterward.
   Castro even found good in the collapse of one-party communist
rule in Eastern Europe, saying Cuba will be able to benefit from
the mistakes committed by the region's ousted Communist leaders.
   Cuba chose the right path, Castro said, because capitalism has
brought to the rest of Latin America rampant disease, inflation,
unemployment and illiteracy. He said Cuba had virtually eliminated
those problems.
   He brushed aside a question about predictions of his demise,
saying ``only God knows,'' and feigned indignation when a Mexican
reporter said he looked tired.
   Castro invited journalists from all over the world to visit Cuba
this week as it engages the United States in a war of words and
electronics over Voice of America telecasts to Cuba.
   The transmissions, known as TV Marti, began March 27 and Cuba
immediately began jamming them. This week, Cuban officials have
been showing off their jamming operations to the foreign reporters.
   While denouncing the trial U.S. telecasts in the strongest
terms, Castro said Tuesday that they play right into his hands.
   ``This war, this aggression, this hostility, far from weakening
the revolution, is strengthening it. It exalts the patriotic
feelings of the people, their honor, their pride,'' he said.
   ``The more they attack the revolution, the more stupidities they
go on doing, the stronger the revolution will be.''
   Cuba's official news agency, Prensa Latina, paraphrased Castro's
comments and the news conference and said: ``He warned that Cuba
can also carry out surgical operations and remarked that such a
U.S. action could end in war.'' Thus far, despite many predictions
by Cuban officials of a strong response, Castro has been content
just to jam TV Marti transmissions.
   The stated U.S. goal is to bring entertainment and balanced news
to Cuba, but Castro calls the project a ``gross instrument of
subversion.''
   He suggested that a future target may be another U.S. broadcast
operation, Radio Marti, which Cuba has allowed to function
relatively unfettered since 1985.
   Castro said it would be wrong to assume that Cuba will allow the
United States to beam radio waves at the island indefinitely.
   The ideal solution, he said, is to allow Cuba the same radio
access to the United States. But he did not see that as a strong
possibility.
   ``The United States cannot refrain from pursuing its feeling of
being the owner of the world,'' Castro said.
   On Monday, President Bush hailed TV Marti as the latest U.S.
effort to broadcast ``the truth'' to Communist countries. The
television station is named after Jose Marti, a hero of Cuban
independence.
   One result of U.S.-Soviet detente, said Castro, is an
increasingly aggressive American attitude _ peace for the
superpowers but not for countries on the U.S. enemies list.
   ``United States policy implies the right to intervene in Latin
America or anywhere in the world,'' Castro said, citing U.S.
military actions in such countries as Panama, Libya and the
Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Arthur Houghton Jr., former president of Steuben
Glass and one-time chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has
died at 83.
   Houghton died Tuesday at Venice (Fla.) Hospital after a brief
illness.
   Houghton was a great-grandson of Armory Houghton, who founded
Corning Glass Works in 1851. He became president of Steuben Glass,
a Corning subsidiary, in 1933 and built its worldwide reputation
during his 40 years in charge.
   Company legend has it that shortly after he took over Steuben,
Houghton spent a Sunday smashing every piece of glass in a company
warehouse to show his dissatisfaction with the design.
   The company's new designs came to be shown in museums in this
country and abroad, and Steuben adopted the slogan ``From ash can
to museum in half a century.''
   Houghton was president of the Metropolitan from 1964 to 1969. In
1969 he was became chairman of the museum's board and served until
1972.
   He sat on the New York Philharmonic's board from 1952 to 1965
and served as chairman from 1958 to 1963. He was also vice chairman
of a committee to create Lincoln Center, where the Philharmonic
moved in 1962.
   Houghton is survived by his wife, Nina, a son and two daughters
by previous marriages. Funeral arrangements were not immediately
known.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oscars and a Barbara Walters special
helped ABC knock NBC out of the No. 1 spot in the ratings after 23
weeks on top.
   Carol Burnett made a triumphant return to prime time on NBC; the
Whoopi Goldberg-Jean Stapleton series ``Bagdad Cafe'' had a strong
debut, and ABC's new ``Equal Justice,'' a lawyer drama, finished in
the middle of the pack.
   For the week, ABC was first during the week ended April 1 with
an average rating of 14.8, NBC was second with 13.3 and CBS third
with 11.7, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Tuesday.
Each point represents 921,000 homes.
   The last time NBC dropped to No. 2 was the week of Oct. 9-15,
when ABC had the World Series.
   ``The Academy Awards clearly lifted us up there,'' said ABC
spokesman Jim Brochu.
   The Academy Awards, a 3{-hour endurance event Monday, was No. 1
in the ratings. The ``Barbara Walters Special,'' featuring
interviews of Chevy Chase, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Warren Beatty,
was sixth.
   ``Carol &amp; Co.'' a half-hour comedy-variety show on Saturday
featuring Miss Burnett and an ensemble company, was in ninth place
on NBC.
   ``Bagdad Cafe,'' based on the movie about a German tourist
stranded at a remote desert diner, was No. 18 for CBS. The
half-hour show is on Friday.
   ``Equal Justice,'' ABC's Wednesday night case for an hour-long
legal drama, was tied for 44th. A two-hour ``Equal Justice'' movie
on Tuesday was tied for 37th.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``The 62nd
Annual Academy Awards,'' ABC, 27.9; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 23.8;
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 21.7; ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC, 21.4; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, 20.4; ``The Barbara Walters
Special,'' ABC, 20.3; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 20.0; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 19.5; ``Carol &amp; Co.,'' NBC, 19.0; and ``The
Wonder Years,'' ABC, 18.4.
   ABC was first in average ratings for the network news shows with
a 10.3, but after seven weeks in third place, CBS edged into second
place. It beat NBC by one-tenth of a ratings point, averaging a 9.4
rating to NBC's 9.3.

<TEXT>
   Two more reported sniper attacks on buses have set
the clock back on contract talks between striking drivers and
Greyhound, which says it won't negotiate until a week passes
without violence.
   A supervisor unloading a bus carrying four passengers in Miami
late Tuesday discovered dents above a window that indicated someone
fired a shotgun at the bus en route from San Antonio, said
Greyhound Lines Inc. spokesman Steve Mead.
   No one heard or saw the blast and no one was injured, he said.
Miami police had no information on the matter, Robert Neff, a duty
officer, said today.
   Earlier Tuesday, a Southeastern Trailways bus was hit by sniper
fire on Interstate 65 about 50 miles south of Louisville, Ky.
Neither the driver nor the lone passenger was injured.
   A Greyhound spokesman, Steve Scarpino, said the gunmen attacking
Southeastern may be confusing the independently owned line with
other Trailways lines Greyhound owns.
   Greyhound, which has offered a $100,000 reward for evidence
against snipers who have fired on at least 30 buses since the
strike by 6,300 union drivers began March 2, called off talks set
for Monday, Mead said.
   ``We're not going back to the table until the violence ends,''
he said. ``We just want one week without violence.''
   The company blames the union for the violence. The union has
suggested the company's refusal to negotiate is partly to blame for
the violence.
   ``We certainly aren't doing this. We want to get back in to
negotiations,'' said Ed Strait, president of Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions. ``I wish whoever's doing this would stop.
They're not helping; they're hindering. We're not on strike against
the public.''
   The union struck over wages and benefits.

<HEAD>Chinese Warning Against Wearing Black On Mourning Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese are being warned not to wear black
armbands or white flowers of mourning on Thursday, the annual
holiday when Chinese honor their dead and a potential time for
anti-government protests.
   Chinese sources said today that some offices and factories in
Beijing were advising workers against displays of mourning on
Qingming, when Chinese traditionally sweep the graves of their
ancestors.
   The Beijing city government has issued orders that ban organized
group visits to cemeteries unless permission is received from
authorities.
   Overseas dissident groups have called on students to ``stroll''
through Tiananmen Square on Thursday in a silent memorial to the
hundreds of people killed when the military crushed the
pro-democracy movement last June.
   A similar appeal to stage ``protest strolls'' on Sunday was
thwarted when police closed the square to the public, ostensibly
for daylong ceremonies to promote civic enthusiasm for the Asian
Games.
   The games are to be held in Beijing in September.
   The government wants to avoid a repetition of the 1976 Qingming
festival, when thousands streamed to Tiananmen to honor Premier
Chou En-lai, who had died earlier in the year, and protest the
party's leftist leaders.
   Suppression of the protesters helped lead to the downfall of the
leftists.
   Beijing citizens are also being told by officials at work and
school to stay away from Tiananmen Square, the focal point of last
year's demonstrations. Factory leaders have been warned they will
be held responsible if workers are involved in any protests.
   A source on one university campus said some students planned to
go to the square on Thursday, but that most were frightened and
would stay away. They have been told they face expulsion or
assignment to work in a remote rural area if caught protesting.
   Police and military presence around the 100-acre square has been
particularly heavy in the past week, partly because the National
People's Congress, China's parliament, is holding its annual
session in the Great Hall of the People west of the square.
   Today 300 to 400 police clearing the square for the closing
session of the congress pushed and struck with clubs people who
were slow in leaving, a foreign witness said. It was not clear if
anyone was injured.
   Since Sunday, two Americans, a reporter and a student, were
detained for an hour or more by police for photographing police or
soldiers on the square. They were told taking photos of people
without police permission was not allowed.

<HEAD>Government Temporarily Suspends King After He Refuses To Sign
Abortion Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Baudouin, a devout Catholic,
stepped down temporarily today rather than sign into law a bill
ending the country's 123-year ban on abortion.
   After relieving the king as head of state, the government
enacted the abortion bill and asked Parliament to restore him as
monarch at a special session on Thursday.
   The highly unusual move, made at the king's request, let the
government enact legislation to allow abortion in the first 12
weeks of pregnancy and relieved the king of his constitutional duty
to sign into law a bill he strongly opposes. Parliament adopted the
bill last week.
   The royal suspension came after Prime Minister Wilfried Martens'
center-left government consulted with the 59-year-old king, who
insisted he could not sign the legislation.
   The king's powers are largely ceremonial. He has no real
legislative powers but under the constitution he signs into law all
the bills.
   In practice, the king also plays an active role behind the
scenes, consulting regularly with government ministers. He has
repeatedly acted to defuse disputes between Dutch- and
French-speaking political parties, which often are locked in
linguistic disputes.
   In public speeches he also has urged Belgium's 6 million Dutch
and 4 million French-speakers to be more considerate of one another.
   The government made clear King Baudouin insisted on finding a
compromise on the abortion legislation.
   ``Judging that his conscience did not permit him to sign the
abortion bill ... the head of state asked the government and the
Parliament to find a legal solution in which the need of the good
functioning of parliamentary democracy can be reconciled with the
right of the king not to act in violation of his conscience,'' it
said in a statement.
   The statement said the royal suspension was legal under the
constitution, which provides for the removal of the monarch if he
or she is deemed to be ``in the impossibility'' of executing his
functions.
   That clause had only been applied once before.
   In 1940, King Leopold III, Baudouin's father, was suspended
after he was taken prisoner by Nazi Germany.
   After the war, Leopold could not return home because of a
controversy over his wartime conduct. His brother, Prince Charles,
became regent and was succeeded by King Baudouin in 1950.

   Wanted: One millionaire to help a small,
rural district build a new school.
   A Riverview School District citizens' group in this town 20
miles from Seattle took out a $175 ad in The Wall Street Journal,
asking for someone to donate $1 million-plus for a school the
district can't afford to build.
   The group has received a few responses, but no big bucks.
   A Colorado stockbroker has offered to set up a charitable trust
for wealthy people who don't have heirs. A special education
professor said he will donate up to a year of his time. And a
Virginian gave the group suggestions on how to set up a
fund-raising network.
   ``People do care,'' said Carol Van Noy, a member of the school
committee that placed the ad. ``But our millionaire hasn't come
forth. I'm hopeful. We really do need $10 million.''
   That's what Riverview School Superintendent Karen Forys
estimated as the cost to replace the current high school and middle
school complex, which is overcrowded.
   The ad, which ran Thursday, will be run once more for free on
Thursday because the newspaper misspelled the district's name as
Riverside.
   ``We'll be checking the mailbox everyday,'' said committee
member Laura Ritter. ``Maybe it just takes a while for this to sink
in.''

<HEAD>Wisconsin Voters Reject `Vanna White Veto'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin voters curtailed the ``Vanna White veto'' power that
let the governor strike letters from words to change the meaning of
legislation, and an Assembly member survived the state's first
recall attempt since 1932.
   Kansas City, Mo., voters Tuesday rejected a curbside recycling
program that would have cost households $1.89 a month. St. Louis
voters approved a 3.5 percent hotel-motel tax increase to help
build a 70,000-seat, domed stadium.
   Two blacks were elected to a new nine-member City Council in
Tulsa, Okla., created because of an NAACP lawsuit challenging the
city's at-large voting system. Only one black had served in the
city's governing commission in the 1980s. Voters also re-elected
Mayor Rodger Randle.
   In the Bismarck, N.D., mayoral election, voters chose Bill
Sorensen, a 40-year-old businessman over city Commissioner Leroy
Walker and Lee Palmer, an 18-year-old high school senior. Palmer
won 1,291 votes, or 11 percent, after campaigning with $80 and a
platform supporting youth, the environment and ``general things
like care for the elderly.''
   In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson once used his veto to
change the amount of time a juvenile could be held in detention,
crossing out ``48 hours'' along with selective letters to make the
time read ``t-e-n day-s.''
   A constitutional amendment curtailing that power was approved
386,178 votes, or 62 percent, to 238,807, or 38 percent, with 99
percent of the precincts reporting.
   Foes of the unlimited veto _ named for Vanna White, the
letter-turner on ``Wheel of Fortune'' _ said it gave legislative
power to the executive branch, violating the constitutional
separation of powers.
   The amendment still allows the governor to strike words,
numerals or entire sentences _ just not individual letters.
   ``Despite the complicated wording of the amendment, the public
basically understood that the governor should not have the
authority to create new words,'' said state Senate President Fred
Risser, a Democrat.
   Thompson's legal counsel, Raymond Taffora, said Tuesday night
the governor was ``disappointed by the vote because the governor's
partial veto authority needs to be as broad as the Legislature's
ability to pass items.''
   Wisconsin voters also re-elected Donald W. Steinmetz to a
10-year term in the state Supreme Court in a close race against
Richard S. Brown, a deaf appeals judge.
   Unofficial returns from 99 percent of the precincts showed
Steinmetz defeated Brown 350,245 votes to 326,310, or 52 percent to
48 percent.
   In northern Wisconsin, state Rep. Jim Holperin defeated
challenger Brian Sherren in a recall. Holperin was targeted by
those opposed to allowing Chippewa Indians to exercise treaty
rights to go spearfishing off the reservation.
   Holperin, a Democrat, survived Wisconsin's first legislative
recall in 58 years by receiving 10,494 votes, or 61 percent, to
6,707 votes, or 39 percent, for Sherren, a Republican.
   Holperin opposed spearfishing of spawning fish but got in
trouble with sportsmen over his support for a proposal to pay a
band of Chippewas $10 million for some of their treaty rights. The
Indians rejected the proposal.
   Sportfishermen and people in the tourist industry say they fear
the spearfishing will deplete fish stocks.

   A suburb is having a devil of a time with its new
voting precinct number.
   Deer Park Council members approved a resolution Tuesday asking
the commissioners of Harris County to renumber Precinct 666 because
some religious folk view the number as symbolic of the Antichrist.
   ``Deer Park is a fairly conservative, religious community, and
it's just a stigma they don't want,'' said Harvey Petree, a Deer
Park city councilman.
   ``I had never heard that the three sixes had any religious
connotation,'' said County Commissioner Jim Fonteno. ``If I would
have known then what I know now, I would have just asked the clerk
to skip a number.''
   Election officials redrew Precinct 470 in August because it had
grown to include 3,200 residents, Fonteno said. The county splits
any precinct with more than 3,000 residents each August, with the
new numbers taking effect in March.
   When the Deer Park districts were split, the new jurisdiction
got the next available number, 666.

   A woman who became one of China's most
wanted fugitives after last spring's pro-democracy movement tried
several times to flee the country before getting out this past
week, a newspaper reported today.
   Chai Ling helped lead the movement that was suppressed June 4
when troops shot their way into central Beijing, driving student
protesters from Tiananmen Square and killing hundreds of unarmed
civilians.
   Ten months later, the 23-year-old activist has emerged in the
West with her husband, Feng Congde.
   Both were on a wanted list of 21 student leaders sought by the
Chinese Communist authorities, who call the pro-democracy protests
a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Chai made a dramatic appearance on Hong Kong television Tuesday
night from an undisclosed location to announce her escape. Although
the broadcast did not say where the interview was held, sources
said she was in Paris. The couple reportedly arrived there Sunday.
   Speaking in a near whisper, the haggard-looking Chai vowed to
keep fighting for democracy and paid tribute to student leaders who
gave their lives for freedom.
   ``There are still many, many people who sacrificed their lives,
who shed blood, who shed sweat and tears, for freedom and
democracy,'' said Chai, frequently pausing to hold back tears.
   ``They are still in jail, or in exile, suffering the
insufferable,'' she said. ``Wherever you are, friends, please
accept our heartfelt blessing.''
   Feng sat by her side and covered his face as he wept.
   Their escape received massive coverage in Hong Kong's newspapers
today, reflecting the widespread sympathy the pro-democracy
students in Beijing have generated in the British colony, which is
to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.
   In Taiwan, newspapers printed her televised statement and
picture on front pages.
   The mass-circulation China Times of Taiwan said the fugitive
couple ``tried several times to leave the border but failed to take
action because of problems at the reception end.''
   They finally escaped ``the tight network of Chinese public
security personnel, went through a tough journey and setbacks, then
left the mainland,'' according to a story by a reporter the
newspaper said had interviewed Chai.
   In her televised appearance, Chai said: `The road to freedom was
very difficult, very long. Because of that, as I reached the last
step toward freedom, I almost ran out of energy. I looked up to see
this free world, to breath the fresh air.''
   The 10-minute television tape appeared to be filmed in an
apartment or hotel room.
   According to the China Times, the couple fled Beijing by train
shortly after the June 4 crackdown. Chai and Feng soon separated
and remained apart for eight months before reuniting two months ago.
   Chai was among the three most prominent student leaders of last
spring's demonstrations. One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to the West
weeks after the crackdown. The other, Wang Dan, was captured by
Chinese authorities in Beijing.
   A native of Shangdong province and a graduate student in the
Department of Psychology at Beijing Normal University, Chai assumed
the title ``commander of the headquarters to defend Tiananmen
Square'' before the crackdown.
   Two Norwegian legislators nominated her for the 1990 Nobel Peace
Prize.
   The China Times said Chai and Feng plan to resume their studies
after a period of readjustment to living in the West.

<HEAD>Town Under Curfew After Bombing and Backlash Kills 36</HEAD>

   Paramilitary troops patrolled a Punjab
town today to try to prevent further violence after a bombing
blamed on Sikh extremists killed 33 people and enraged Hindus
retaliated by killing three people.
   People were confined to their homes by a curfew imposed on
Batala shortly after Tuesday's bombing of a Hindu religious
procession.
   Police said 33 people were killed and 68 injured when the bomb
exploded as about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of the
warrior-god Rama paraded through a crowded vegetable market. Most
of the victims were Hindus, though some Sikh onlookers were among
the casualties.
   Immediately after the blast, Hindus beat to death two women
nurses at a nearby hospital and a Sikh policeman, witnesses said.
   The nurses' religion was not immediately known. They were killed
because a Hindu crowd was furious at finding no doctors on duty at
the hospital, the witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In New Delhi, members of the opposition Congress Party walked
out of Parliament when Speaker Rabi Ray refused to allow the Lok
Sabha, or House of the People, to discuss the violence.
   At a Sikh temple near Parliament, the most influential Sikh
leader in Punjab condemned the killings of the Hindus.
   But the leader, lawmaker Simranjeet Singh Mann, also added:
``Sikhs are being massacred. Our constitutional rights are being
steamrolled.''
   He then led a procession of about 200 Sikhs to Parliament. When
Mann arrived he was not allowed in because he was carrying a sword,
a Sikh religious symbol, and refused to leave it outside.
   Militant Sikh separatists, who want to create an independent
nation for their religious minority, have killed more than 500
people this year in Punjab, a prosperous northern farming state
where they hold a slight majority.
   Tuesday's attack was one of the worst this year. On March 7, a
bomb and rifle attack by Sikh militants killed 34 people in the
predominantly Hindu town of Abohar.
   Batala, a predominantly Hindu town of 120,000 people, is 25
miles northeast of Amritsar, a major center of the Sikh separatist
movement and site of the faith's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple.
   After the bombing, Hindu crowds went on a rampage and hurled
stones at a police station 450 feet from the blast site, said Gur
Inder Singh Bhuller, deputy inspector general of police. He said
five policemen were injured, and their colleagues fired in the air
to disperse the mob.
   Witnesses said the mobs set fire to several shops and vehicles
and tried to torch a Sikh gurdwara, or place of worship.
   Punjab state police, many of whom are Sikhs, were withdrawn from
Batala to stop the backlash. Some people accused police of not
providing sufficient security during the Ram Navami celebrations.
   Members of the federal government's Border Security Force were
deployed in Batala after the blast. They patrolled on foot and in
jeeps equipped with light machine guns.
   Senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said the bomb was hidden
in a motor scooter parked outside a cigarette kiosk. He said he did
not know if it had a timing device or was detonated by remote
control.
   Goel said the bomb probably was planted by Sikh radicals. Other
officials, speaking on condition of anonmity, also blamed Sikh
extremists.
   Many of the victims were blown to pieces. Fragments of bodies
and blood-stained vegetables were flung across the market.
   ``There was a loud sound. Then the entire area was covered with
dark smoke and fire, which rose as high as electric poles,'' food
vendor Pre Nath said from his hospital bed in Amritsar, where he
was treated for leg injuries.
   The violent Sikh separatist campaign began in 1982 in Punjab,
where more than 1,800 people were killed in the separatist violence
last year.
   Nationwide, Sikhs make up only 2 percent of the population of
880 million while Hindus comprise 82 percent. Sikhs, whose faith
has roots in Hinduism and Islam, say they are culturally and
politically discriminated against by Hindus.

   A woman accused of trading her baby for
cocaine has pleaded guilty to attempted child abandonment and
endangerment of a child.
   Lisa Price, 24, admitted that she tried to abandon her
3-month-old son at the Who Care's-So What Bar in September. She
also admitted to Jackson County Associate Circuit Judge Leonard
Hughes that she endangered her son's health by leaving him lying on
the hood of a car outside the bar.
   But she did not admit during court Tuesday to giving the child
to a drug dealer in exchange for $20 worth of crack, as witnesses
at the bar alleged.
   Her son, now 10 months old, is in the care of the Division of
Family Services.
   In exchange for the guilty plea to both misdemeanors,
prosecutors dropped three felony charges against her and
recommended she be placed on two years' probation. Hughes agreed to
do so.
   According to assistant prosecutor Jeff Bushur, Price said she
was just trying to give the baby to someone who could care for him.

<HEAD>Study: Anti-Viral Herpes Drug Effective Against Chickenpox</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug used to treat genital herpes has been
found to speed up children's recovery from chickenpox, a University
of Minnesota study says.
   Acyclovir reduced the number of itchy blisters and shortened by
a day the normal five-day course of chickenpox in 50 Twin Cities
children who received the drug, according to a report in this
month's Journal of Pediatrics.
   Acyclovir is ``a safe and effective treatment'' for the illness,
which almost every American gets sometime during childhood, said
Dr. Henry Balfour, the pediatrician who headed the study.
   Balfour said Tuesday that the finding is important because most
complications develop near the end of a typical five-day infection.
   He said some doctors may delay prescribing acyclovir until
results of a larger, 10-city study are released, probably later
this year.
   Other doctors may limit the use of acyclovir to youngsters 11
and older, who tend to have the most severe cases of chickenpox,
Balfour said. But he predicted that its use eventually will be
widespread.
   Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of
the herpes family of viruses, so it was natural to try the herpes
drug against it, he said.
   About 3.5 million Americans a year develop chickenpox. About
4,000 children are hospitalized each year from complications of the
disease, which include skin or ear infections, pneumonia and brain
infections, Balfour said.
   No chickenpox vaccine is licensed for use in the United States,
but vaccines are being tried in other countries, he said.
   In the study, within a day of developing their first chickenpox
sores 50 youngsters got a syrup containing acyclovir, and 52 others
got one with no medication in it.
   The children getting the acyclovir ended up developing an
average of 336 skin lesions, compared with more than 500 lesions
for those who didn't get it.
   Healing started within a day after the youngsters got acyclovir,
compared with two days for those who didn't get it.
   Blood tests a year later indicated that acyclovir didn't
interfere with the youngsters developing immunity to this virus, a
process that normally prevents a person from having a second case
of chickenpox.
   The study, sponsored in part by Burroughs Wellcome Co.,
manufacturer of acyclovir, was carried out from February through
June 1987. Testing for immunity and analysis took two years.

<HEAD>Libyan Leader Urges Moslems to Release Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged Moslems to
celebrate their holy month of Ramadan by releasing foreign hostages
held in the Middle East, Libya's official news agency said today.
   Col. Gadhafi specifically mentioned Jacqueline Valente, a
Frenchwoman captured on a yacht off Cyprus in 1987 by Abu Nidal's
Libyan-backed Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the JANA news agency
report said.
   Gadhafi appealed to ``Moslems the world over in his capacity as
the leader of the international Islamic People's Command calling
for releasing the hostages and prisoners of conscience on the
advent of the blessed month of Ramadan _ the month of love and
tolerance,'' said JANA, monitored in Rome.
   Ramadan began in late March.
   The JANA dispatch said Gadhafi stressed Islamic humanitarian
values and called for refraining from detaining innocent people.
   ``He has called to mind the hostages in the Middle East of
various nationalities and religions, in particular the French
hostage,'' Jacqueline Valente. She was captured along with her two
daughters and five Belgians. The Abul Nidal group claimed they were
Israeli spies. Her whereabouts are unknown.
   The children, then aged 7 and 6, were freed in December 1988,
reportedly after Gadhafi intervened.
   After their release, Gadhafi urged ``liberation movements in the
Middle East'' to free the rest of the hostages. The group has not
been included on the list of Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are missing and
presumed held captive. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
   He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>De Klerk to Meet With Mandela, Political Leaders for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk will
meet Nelson Mandela and other top leaders Thursday for talks on
stopping widespread unrest and reviving negotiations on ending
white-minority rule, officials said.
   Government and opposition officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said today that de Klerk will meet in Cape Town with
Mandela and hold separate talks with a wide range of political
leaders. Expected to attend the talks are Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, heads of tribal homelands, leaders of various political
parties and top government ministers.
   Mandela and several other African National Congress leaders will
meet de Klerk privately for talks on efforts to end political
violence. The talks also will focus on reviving peace negotiations
that were stalled when the ANC pulled out of an April 11 meeting.
   De Klerk's meetings with a wide range of leaders represent a
major drive by the government to resolve the issues.
   Mandela told a news conference today that he could not say when
full-scale talks on ending white-minority rule would be held.
``That will depend on the result of the discussions we are going to
have tomorrow,'' he said.
   Police said today that three people were killed in vicious black
factional fighting around Edendale in Natal Province that has
claimed at least 58 lives in the past week. Two other people died
in factional fighting in other parts of Natal, they said.
   Police commanders in the Edendale said the area was still very
tense with sporadic clashes between rival war bands. Mobs set fire
to at least eight homes and more than 12,000 refugees had fled the
area, they said.
   South Africa has been hit by a wave of political violence in
recent weeks that has claimed hundreds of lives. The fighting has
ranged from tribal clashes in Natal to violent protests in black
urban townships.
   Zulu leader Buthelezi appealed to Mandela to join him in efforts
to stop the fighting in Natal. Buthelezi urged Mandela not to allow
politics to interfere with peace efforts.
   ``I appeal to him to stand above politicking about life and
death,'' he said in a statement.
   ``When people are dying and people are being maimed, black
leaders should have the courage of their convictions to go to the
trouble spots and to mediate between the warring factions.''
   Mandela pulled out of a joint rally with Buthelezi in the
Edendale area Monday after saying the time was not right. Mandela
did tour the area Monday and Tuesday, appealing for peace.
   The Natal fighting, which has claimed about 3,000 lives in
recent years, pits rival Zulu factions of the ANC-backed United
Democratic Front against Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha movement.
Both groups are anti-apartheid, but they differ over plans for
South Africa's future.
   Mandela agreed to meet de Klerk Thursday after the ANC suddenly
pulled out of planned April 11 talks with the government. The talks
were to focus on ways to remove barriers to full-scale negotiations
on ending white-minority rule.
   The ANC said it was pulling out to protest the police killing of
nine black protesters March 26 in the black township of Sebokeng
outside of Johannesburg. ANC leaders say they will hold talks once
the government imposes controls on the police.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black opposition groups in
February and released Mandela after 27 years in jail. He has
promised to end white rule and share political power with the black
majority.

   A decade ago, governors in the Northeast were
riding a wave of economic growth to political heights. But hard
times have plunged them into the depths of a political depression
as well as an economic one.
   Vermont's Madeleine Kunin on Tuesday became the third
Northeastern governor to decide against re-election this year,
announcing she won't seek a fourth two-year term. Her state's
budget has been sharply cut, while a 12 percent increase in the
personal income tax has been proposed.
   All three of the retiring governors are Democrats whose
political futures cascaded with the economy and failed legislative
programs.
   ``There's economic depression and also depressions in the
political world. I think we're in one,'' said Frank Bryan,
associate professor of political science at the University of
Vermont in Burlington. ``One of the symptoms of political
depression is the candidate says, `The hell with it. It isn't worth
it to fight through this anymore.'''
   The governors apparently are tired of the burdens and negative
reaction they would face in re-election bids next fall.
   ``This is really a typical pattern for difficult economic
times,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the
University of Virginia who follows governors closely. ``When a
egion is in trouble economically governors are simply encouraged to
retire. They get tired of the burdens and also realize they might
be defeated. They don't want to go out that way.''
   That apparently was the case with Govs. Michael S. Dukakis of
Massachusetts and William A. O'Neill of Connecticut.
   Dukakis won the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination partly
on the strength of the ``Massachusetts Miracle.'' That economic
takeoff began unraveling even during Dukakis' White House campaign.
   Dukakis announced more than a year ago that he would not seek a
third consecutive term. His state faces a deficit of at least $780
million.
   Two weeks ago, O'Neill said he would not seek a third full term
after his standing in the polls dropped. His unpopularity
apparently stemmed from nearly $1 billion in tax increases he
approved last year.
   ``The big question is if there are going to be any exceptions to
this process,'' said Paul Watanabe, head of the political science
department at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
   Watanabe said political analysts will be watching whether Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York, a potential Democratic presidential
candidate, is able to buck the trend.
   ``In some respects so far he has,'' said Watanabe. ``I think
he's been effective in indicating his ability to manage a crisis
within New York and his ability to do so is going to significantly
effect perceptions of him as a viable national figure.''
   Cuomo is facing his third consecutive year of budget deficits
and is talking about $1 billion in higher taxes. He has said he
expects to seek re-election to a third term but has made no formal
announcement.
   The GOP has branded Cuomo the ``Michael Dukakis of New York,''
but the Republicans have not put up a strong candidate of their
own. Independent polls still give Cuomo high ratings.
   Cuomo said Tuesday that being a governor has become more and
more difficult largely because the federal government is shifting
more financial responsibility to the states.
   The economic woes thus far have not derailed the plans of the
region's three Republican governors to seek re-election.
   Gov. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire has overcome a $160 million
deficit. The Legislature cut services, laid off state employees and
raised taxes on cigarettes, beer, gasoline, rooms and meals,
business profits and real estate transfers. Gregg opposes a general
sales and income tax.
   Maine is facing a $210 million deficit, but Gov. John R.
McKernan said he is not abandoning his re-election campaign. He has
strong opposition from his predecessor, Democrat Joseph E. Brennan,
who has made the budget problems a key issue.
   Even though Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete's popularity in
a recent Brown University poll dipped to an all-time low of 30
percent, he is seeking his fourth two-year term. DiPrete is saddled
with a $100 million deficit and has made cuts in social programs.

   Israel's second experimental satellite is
orbiting the earth every 90 minutes and will remain in space for
about 60 days, Israel Space Agency officials said today.
   ``Until now, all funcitons are working as planned and we are
very satisfied with it,'' space agency administrator Moshe Bar-Lev
told Israel radio.
   The 350-pound satellite, Ofek-2, was launched Tuesday by a
three-stage rocket developed by Israel.
   Bar-Lev said the satellite had circled earth 16 times so far and
that scientists are able to contact it the every time it passes
over the country.
   The director of the space agency, Yuvall Neeman, said the Ofek-2
was lifted into space by the ``Shavit'' _ Hebrew for comet _
launcher which was developed by the Israel Aircraft Industries.
   ``It has two stages that are big rockets and a third and last
stage which is really a small engine used to put the satellite into
its proper orbit,'' he told The Associated Press.
   He said the engine was a slightly modified version of the Shavit
rocket that lifted Israel's first satellite, Ofek-1, into space on
Sept. 19, 1988. Ofek-1 remained aloft for four months.
   The Yediot Aharonot and the Al-Hamishmar newspapers quoted
foreign reports as saying the Shavit was a modified version of the
launcher designed to propel the Jericho-II, a surface-to-surface
missile with a range of 1,375 miles.
   Earlier foreign reports said the Ofek-1 was also launched by the
rocket that propels the Jericho-II.
   Neeman said he had no information of the Jericho missiles, and a
spokesman for the Israel Aircraft Industries said he knew nothing
about any such missile.

<HEAD>Premier Says Chinese Leadership Is `Strong'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Li saying leadership strong, no
comeback possible for Zhao. Edits throughout to tighten. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng said today that the Chinese
leadership is ``united and strong,'' and he rejected the possiblity
of a comeback for his disgraced predecessor Zhao Ziyang.
   In a 90-minute news conference, his first meeting with foreign
reporters in almost a year, Li said: ``I don't think I'm extremely
capable or extremely rich in political experience or entirely up to
this job.''
   But he added that he was ``somewhat more confident than when I
was nominated to the post'' in 1988 for a five-year term.
   Also today, the National People's Congress, or parliament,
closed its annual session after passing bills on Hong Kong and
joint ventures aimed at reassuring a doubtful world the doors to
China remained open.
   The 2,700 deputies to the 15-day session also approved a work
report by Li that said China would never yield to threats against
its socialist system.
   In the report _ China's version of a station-of-the-nation
address _ Li hailed the ``victory'' over the pro-democracy
movement, which troops crushed in June in an assault on central
Beijing that claimed hundreds of lives.
   But at the news conference, Li's first appearance before the
foreign press since June, he refused to specify who ordered the
crackdown, saying that force was used ``only after a long period of
patient waiting'' and after the nation and its socialist system was
jeopardized by anarchy.
   The 62-year-old premier appeared relaxed and confident, but his
responses were generally vague.
   ``The core of leadership with (Communist Party chief) Jiang
Zemin as the nucleus is united and strong, and I believe it
commands the support of the Chinese people,'' said Li, who declined
to speculate on his own political future.
   He said the decision by parliament Tuesday to name Jiang to
replace senior leader Deng Xiaoping as chairman of the state
Central Military Commission confirmed the army was ``under the
absolute leadership of the party.''
   He said Jiang's appointment to the last official post the
85-year-old Deng had held would ``contribute to political
stability.''
   Jiang was named head of the 48-million-member Communist Party in
June after Zhao was purged for allegedly supporting the
pro-democracy students and dividing the party.
   Li said Zhao, who has not been seen in public since May, was in
good health, living at home in Beijing and had not been imprisoned.
Zhao, who was stripped of all his party posts, remains a party
member but investigations into his activities continue, Li said.
   He doubted whether Zhao, who still commands a wide silent
following in China because of his reformist policies, could stage a
political comeback. ``I don't think that is the prediction of the
majority of the Chinese people.''
   Li said the just-concluded parliament session would ``inspire
the Chinese people to work with one heart and one mind to promote
political and social stability.''
   The congress wields little political power in China's
party-dominated system.
   In his state-of-the-nation report, delivered on parliament's
opening day, Li said economic sanctions imposed by Western nations
after the crackdown would fail, and China would stand firm against
any foreign and domestic ``hostile forces'' trying to subvert
Communist Party rule.
   All proposals submitted by parliament Chairman Wan Li were
passed by overwhelming majorities.
   The two key bills approved today define the basic law for Hong
Kong after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997 and amend the joint
venture law to further protect foreign investors in China.
   The basic law provides that Hong Kong will have a high level of
autonomy on all matters except national defense and foreign affairs
after 1997, and that its capitalist system will be untouched for 50
years.
   It also says the legal system adopted under British colonial
rule will in general be kept, and that Hong Kong will remain an
international financial center and free port.
   Political activists in the colony have expressed misgivings
about the basic law, saying it will impede democratic reform in
Hong Kong and give Beijing arbitrary powers to declare a state of
emergency.
   The amendments to the 1979 joint venture law were seen as a
gesture to foreign investors wary of doing business in China after
the crackdown.
   They stipulate that the lifetime of a joint venture, previously
limited to 30 years, can be open-ended, and guarantee that such
ventures will never be nationalized ``under normal circumstances.''
   The law was also amended to say a foreign partner could be
elected chairman of the venture. Previously, the Chinese side
headed the board, even when the foreign partner's equity share
exceeded 50 percent.

   Eight inmates escaped from an
overcrowded San Diego County jail in its third breakout since
December.
   Seven of the latest escapees were still at large this morning, a
sheriff's spokesman said.
   One was recaptured Tuesday night shortly after the eight cut
their way through bars and kicked out a third-story window at the
South Bay Detention Facility, said Sgt. Jim Cooke. A rope made of
several knotted bed sheets was left hanging from the window.
   Officers circled the jail and were searching the area, Cooke
said.
   Six escapees remain free from 13 who broke out in March and
seven who escaped in December.
   Soon after last month's escape, county officials authorized
$103,000 in security improvements at the jail, including the hiring
of private guards.
   Other improvements authorized but not expected to be completed
for three months include new motion sensors, window grates and
exterior cameras. The jail, which is designed to house 192 inmates,
frequently holds more than 800 prisoners.
   Since January 1989, 51 inmates have escaped from the county's
seven jails and 24 have been recaptured.

   Disneyland's aging Dumbo the Flying
Elephant crash landed, slightly injuring a teen-age passenger and
grounding the park ride for a least a month of repairs.
   The fiberglass elephant car carrying the girl fell about 5 feet
to the ground when a metal support beam snapped, Disneyland
spokesman Bob Roth said Tuesday of Saturday's accident.
   ``Wear and tear is what it amounts to,'' Roth said. ``We'll have
to wait to see what work needs to be done but it'll be closed at
least a month.''
   The 13-year-old girl, who was not identified, was treated at
Disneyland's first aid station for a bumped nose and minor bruises,
Roth said. She was taken to a hospital and returned to the park
later in the day.
   The Fantasyland attraction, based on an elephant in a Disney
animated feature in the 1950s, is among the oldest in the
35-year-old theme park. Fiberglass elephant cars rotate around a
pivot and passengers in the cars manipulate a lever to make the
cars move up and down.
   ``It was due for a major rehabilitation in about a month,'' Roth
said. The ride is overhauled once a year by Disney technicians, he
added.
   A family of three suffered scrapes and bruises in a similar
accident on the Dumbo ride a year ago, Roth said.

<HEAD>Smithsonian to Charge for Temporary Exhibit on Dinosaurs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusual but not unprecedented move, the
Smithsonian Institution will charge fees for a temporary exhibit
opening next week.
   Smithsonian Undersecretary Dean Anderson said the charge for
``Dinamation's Dinosaurs Alive and In Color'' was an experiment
that will allow the museum to display an exhibit that otherwise
would be too expensive to produce.
   The exhibition on dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History
will cost $4 for adults, $2 for children under 12 and will be free
for children under 3.
   ``We pride ourselves on being free to the public.... We have a
sense that coming to the Smithsonian (is) tantamount to an exercise
of citizenship. Only if we're doing something very special does it
make sense to charge a fee,'' Anderson said.
   The Smithsonian joined with Dinamation International Inc. of San
Juan Capistrano, Calif., in a joint venture to develop and show.
The Smithsonian will receive a share of the profits of the show,
which runs through Sept.3.
   Anderson noted that the museum charges admission for its
planetarium and films at the Air and Space Museum. And officials
said the Smithsonian's Arts and Industry Museum charged 25 cents
for an exhibit on drug abuse in the early 1970s.
   The National Zoo, also run by the Smithsonian, will test an
admission charge for another dinosaur exhibit, officials said.

<HEAD>Restorers Will Not Remove Additions to Michelangelo Fresco</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restorers cleaning Michelangelo's ``Last
Judgment'' have decided not to remove changes another artist made
to cover images deemed offensive in the Sistine Chapel fresco,
Vatican Museum officials said.
   In 1564, Pope Pius IV, after siding with some 16th-century
church officials shocked by nude figures in the 60-by-30-foot
painting on the wall above the chapel altar, ordered artist Daniele
da Volterra to cover up the most ``indecent'' nudes.
   Fabrizio Mancinelli, directing the cleaning of Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel frescoes, told a news conference Tuesday that
instead of painting over Michelangelo's creation, da Volterra
substituted his own fresco after first removing Michelangelo's.
   ``Since the additions are in fresco _ removing the original
fresco _ there is no real choice to take away those portions,''
said Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a New York University art
historian who is a consultant on the Sistine Chapel project.
   Mancinelli and Ms. Brandt said a conference of 54 international
specialists who met last week at the Vatican decided there would be
no attempt to remove the additions.
   Michelangelo painted the ``Last Judgment'' more than 20 years
after he finished the ceiling, which he worked on between 1508 and
1512. The painting, now hidden by scaffolding, depicts a forceful
Christ standing in judgment surrounded by apprehensive saints,
angels and mythological figures.
   Mancinelli said the work to clean the masterpiece, the last
phase of the Sistine Chapel restoration, will take about four
years, including the time needed for scientific evaluation of the
painting and the cleaning methods to ensure the work is not damaged
in the process.
   The chapel restoration has been been surrounded by controversy.
   Critics led by James Beck, a Columbia University art historian,
charged that the restorters were removing some of Michelangelo's
retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes.
   Mancinelli said the team left Michelangelo's work intact,
removing only a dirty glue-varnish that had been added by restorers
in the 17th and 18th centuries.
   To protect the newly cleaned frescoes and still allow them to be
seen by thousands of visitors each day, the Vatican is regulating
the humidity and has installed anti-dust carpets.

   A couple are suing a hospital for $4
million, complaining staff members nicknamed their baby
``Smurfette'' because her skin was accidentally dyed blue.
   The suit claims Kirsten Madsen was ``subjected to the callous,
distressing remarks ... among which was the reference to her
just-delivered daughter as `Smurfette.'''
   Smurfette is a character in ``The Smurfs'' cartoon show. The
Smurfs are elflike creatures with blue skin.
   The suit says Mrs. Madsen was injected with blue dye in her womb
to test for a urinary tract infection 12 hours before she went into
labor at Baptist Hospital year ago.
   Hospital spokeswoman Debbie Koch said no one at the hospital has
any knowledge about use of the term ``Smurfette.''
   ``Today was the first time any of us have heard those words
used,'' she said. ``We have no reason to believe that to be true.''
Koch said the baby was discolored temporarily and was not harmed.
   The suit, filed last week, asked damages for negligence and for
``extreme, distressing and permanent emotional damage, humiliation
and ridicule.''

<DATELINE>ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian government troops
backed by tanks and heavy artillery today retook a strategic town
held by non-Communist guerrillas, according to guerrilla and
Western sources.
   The district capital of Tmar Pouk fell late this morning after
continuous heavy attacks that began the previous day, the sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Tmar Pouk is in northwestern Cambodia close to the Thai
frontier. It was held by the two non-Communist guerrilla factions
opposing the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government: the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front and fighters loyal to former
monarch Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Government troops backed by Soviet-made tanks and artillery
attacked Tmar Pouk from positions to the south that had been
retaken over the past weeks, a senior Liberation Front official
said.
   Guerrilla sources also reported a heavy government attack on a
Liberation Front military headquarters at Boueng Trakuan opposite
the Thai town of Taphraya, 30 miles north of Aranyaprathet.
   Western relief workers in Taphraya said the shelling across the
border was so heavy it shook houses in the town.
   As many as 5,000 refugees have fled the fighting to the giant
Site 2 refugee camp, about 60 miles north of Aranyaprathet, Western
relief officials said.
   Western diplomats said there were reports that thousands more
civilians had fled Tmar Pouk to take refuge in remaining
guerrilla-held areas inside Cambodia, which the guerrillas call
``liberated zones.''
   The diplomats expected government troops would continue their
push northward to the last remaining Liberation Front stronghold of
Banteay Chamar.
   ``This spells the end for the liberated zones. The only
remaining stronghold of Banteay Chamar will now fall for sure,''
one of the diplomats said.
   A senior Liberation Front official said the fall of Tmar Pouk
occurred because a shipment of Chinese weapons failed to arrive.
China is a main backer of the guerrillas.
   Western relief workers also said there were reports of heavy
government attacks on Khmer Rouge positions opposite the town of
Trat on the southernmost part of Thailand' border with Cambodia.
These had occurred over the past few weeks, but the sources had no
more details.
   The government launched a major counteroffensive in late
February, and has succeeded in retaking much of the area seized by
the guerrillas shortly after Vietnam said it had withdrawn all its
pro-government troops in late September.
   The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to stop border
attacks by the communist Khmer Rouge, which controlled Cambodia
from 1975-1978. During that time, hundreds of thousands of
Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest.
   The Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government has been fighting a
coalition of three major Cambodian resistance groups _ the Khmer
Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and followers
of Sihanouk _ for control of the country. International peace
efforts have so far failed.
   Earlier today, Sihanouk returned to Bangkok from Beijing en
route to his home in a liberated zone in Oddar Meanchey province,
north of Tmar Pouk, a spokesman for the prince, Ek Sereywath, said.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's major political parties today
resumed talks on forming a government on the eve of the opening
session of the country's first freely elected Parliament.
   The major powerbrokers in the coalition talks said they were
optimistic that a new government could be formed soon, but not
before the middle of next week.
   The conservative Alliance for Germany, which won the most
Parliament seats in the March 18 elections, is trying to form a
coalition with the Social Democrats, who finished a distant second.
   The major parties met separately today after meeting together
the day before. Spokesmen later said it was unlikely a new
government would be formed this week.
   The talks are crucial to the formation of a Cabinet that will
lead negotiations with West Germany and the former World War II
allies on unification of the two German states.
   The Alliance for Germany led by Lothar de Maiziere, the likely
premier of the nation, favors rapid reunification, while the
left-leaning Social Democrats want a gradual melding of nations.
   The negotiations took on an air of urgency this week after West
Germany's central bank recommended a 2-1 conversion of East German
marks to West German marks as part of a currency union.
   East German parties united in opposition to that proposal and
called for a direct 1-1 conversion to ease the withdrawal pains of
unemployment and high prices as East Germany sheds it socialist
system.
   But the Social Democrats still are opposed to the more
conservative elements in de Maiziere's coalition. Much of the
wrangling has been over the distribution of Cabinet posts in a
newly formed government.
   ``There are indeed as before substantial differences, but these
are not insurmountable,'' lawmaker Richard Schroeder, leader of the
Social Democrat faction in Parliament, said Tuesday.
   Social Democrat spokesman Guenther Krug said there would not be
a coalition if the Social Democrats' positions were not adequately
represented in a coalition platform expected to be hammered out
during negotiations.
   The first openly elected lawmaking body in the nation's history
is to convene on Thursday in what will likely be a ceremonial
session with little substantive political action.
   Since East Germans toppled the hard-line government of Erich
Honecker in October, a Communist caretaker has been running the
economically troubled nation.
   The talks have been hamstrung over allegations that many members
of the new Parliament cooperated with or worked for the former
secret police of the old Stalinist leadership.
   Social Democrat leader Ibrahim Boehme resigned over the weekend
because of such allegations, although he has denied involvement.
   De Maiziere has denied similar allegations.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city Board of Supervisors is
considering a resolution to urge the Legislature to pay for testing
in San Francisco of the French abortion pill.
   A group of doctors has formulated a plan to test the pill,
called RU 486, at three San Francisco hospitals. It is estimated
that clinical trials involving some 200 women would cost $60,000 to
$100,000.
   The proposal, introduced by Supervisor Terence Hallinan on
Monday, was developed at the urging of former city Supervisor Carol
Ruth Silver. She heads an organization aiming to make RU 486
available to women in the United States.
   The federal Food and Drug Administration has indicated it would
not approve clinical trials of the drug because of the Bush
administration's objections to abortion. Moreover, anti-abortion
groups oppose the pill.
   Testing in California could be conducted under state legislation
originally passed to help speed testing of AIDS drugs.
   However, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Tuesday: ``California
law for testing only involves drugs that are made, tested and sold
in California. If the drug is imported, it triggers FDA
jurisdiction.''
   The FDA has allowed only one group of U.S. researchers, at the
University of Southern California, to import the drug for a limited
trial.

   The Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission counts 46
states _ going on 47 _ as having an official state holiday honoring
the late civil rights leader. But not everyone agrees on that count.
   Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana will be the only states
without a King holiday with the governor's promised signature of a
bill approved last week in Idaho, according to Margie Hollums of
the commission staff.
   But North Dakota's holiday isn't paid, and Louisiana's is by
proclamation rather than legislation. And some of the King Day
states give employees other holiday options.
   Three states have established the holiday as a day other than
the third Monday in January. Louisiana makes it Jan. 19, Maryland
Jan. 15 and New Jersey the Monday after Jan. 15.
   Backers of the King holiday sometimes have argued that it is not
official unless it is adopted by legislation as a paid holiday on a
weekday. Under that logic, the number of states with a holiday will
be no more than 45 and as few as 43, depending whether the dates
set by Louisiana and Maryland fall on weekdays in any given year.
   Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands have
a paid holiday, the first two by legislation and the latter two by
executive order.

   Threats to water supplies created by a fuel
spill in the Allegheny River waned as the slick snaked along the
Ohio River toward Ohio and West Virginia.
   ``In our tests we're seeing a marked dissipation in the amounts
of fuel throughout the rivers,'' said Betsy Mallison, spokeswoman
for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
   The concentration of petroleum 5 feet deep in the Ohio River at
West View dropped from 75 parts per billion at 1 p.m. to 25 parts
per billion six hours later, Ms. Mallison said.
   The spill, which stretched 14 miles through the river in
industrial Beaver County early today, came from at least 75,000
gallons of diesel, gasoline and kerosene seeped from a severed
interstate pipeline into an Allegheny River tributary Friday after
a mudslide near Freeport in rural Armstrong County. The Allegheny
flows into the Ohio River at Pittsburgh.
   The spill at one time had threatened the water supplies of up to
1 million people along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers.
   The Midland Water Authority, about five miles east of the Ohio
and West Virginia state lines, closed its intakes at 11 p.m.
Tuesday, and the spill's leading edge passed about 2{ hours later,
plant manager John Uccellini said. The authority serves 11,700
Beaver County residents in Midland, Ohioville and Industry.
   Uccellini said state environmental officials would test the
water for oil concentrations, and the intakes likely would be
reopened later today.
   Across the Ohio border, officials in East Liverpool were testing
the water but had detected no trace of oil as of 8:45 a.m., said
Joe Miller, chief of the East Liverpool filtration plant.
   The water authority in East Liverpool, which serves about 7,000
customers, closed two intakes near the surface of the water but
hoped to continue drawing water from an intake at the bottom of the
river, Miller said.
   The state National Guard offered 100 water tankers to Midland
area residents, said Russell Chiodo, director of the Beaver County
Emergency Management Agency.
   ``I pray that we don't need them,'' he said.
   The spill was no threat to other water systems serving Beaver
County because those systems draw well water, Chiodo added.
   Freeport, the first city to stop drawing water over the weekend,
reopened intakes that were closed for 3{ days. Ten water plants
along the Allegheny had resumed use of river water Tuesday night,
Ms. Mallison said.
   About 20,000 residents of Harrison Township were asked to boil
water to kill bacteria that might have grown in the system when it
was empty, she said.
   Nine oil-collecting booms on the Allegheny were removed because
they weren't necessary, said federal Environmental Protection
Agency spokeswoman Carrie Deitzel. Sixteen other booms remained in
the river.
   The state is calculating environmental and lost-water costs to
be charged to the owner of the severed petroleum line,
Allentown-based Buckeye Pipeline Co., said Mark McClellan, the
Department of Environmental Resources deputy secretary.
   The company also could face fines for delaying notification of
the spill to the state, he said.

<HEAD>Hemophiliacs Live with Uncertainty of AIDS Infection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than half of the nation's 20,000
hemophiliacs, the AIDS virus is a fixture of daily life _ just like
the blood protein supplements that both keep them well and gave
them the dangerous infection.
   Like Ryan White, the Indiana teen-ager whose fight against AIDS
bias made him a national symbol, most hemophiliacs became infected
during the early 1980s before anyone knew that the virus was
spreading silently by means of their medical treatment.
   Hemophilia is an inherited disorder in which blood fails to clot
properly. To prevent uncontrolled bleeding, hemophiliacs need
infusions of factor VIII, a blood-clotting protein that their
bodies lack. The substance is refined from the blood of many donors.
   The treatment became tainted with HIV, the AIDS virus, between
1978 and 1984. Better cleansing techniques eventually made factor
VIII free of HIV, but by then, thousands of hemophiliacs were
already infected.
   The National Hemophilia Foundation in New York now estimates
that about 55 percent of the nation's 20,000 hemophiliacs carry
HIV. The uncertainty of when or if they will develop AIDS is a
simple fact of life for these people.
   About 1,200 of the 125,000 AIDS victims since the epidemic began
have been hemophiliacs. But those numbers are likely to grow,
perhaps substantially.
   ``This is what scare us the most,'' said Alan Brownstein,
executive director of the hemophilia foundation. ``All of these
people were infected at least six years ago. As we learn more about
the incubation period, we know we are getting closer and closer to
a time when even more people with hemophilia will get AIDS.''
   To help forestall this, the drug AZT is now recommended for
infected hemophiliacs whose blood counts fall below a certain
level. However, some doctors say that many outwardly well
hemophiliacs are reluctant to begin routine treatment with this
medicine.
   In fact, despite their high risk, hemophiliacs often appear
reluctant to face up to the possibility that they might die from
AIDS. Brownstein said that in some parts of the country, one-third
of hemophiliacs have not been tested to see if they are infected.
   Some say this denial is simply another facet of going through
life with a disease that makes routine chores and pleasures
hazardous. For people with severe hemophilia, a fall or a cut can
cause dangerous bleeding.
   ``There are strong denial elements that exist for many
hemophiliacs. If they didn't have denial skills from early
childhood, they never would have taken the training wheels off
their bikes,'' said Dr. Richard Lipton of Long Island Jewish
Hospital.
   Dr. Bruce Furie of New England Medical Center in Boston said
some infected hemophiliacs seem to take comfort from the fact that
physicians cannot tell them with 100 percent confidence that they
will get AIDS.
   ``They are living normal and productive lives,'' he said. ``They
went through their crisis three or four years ago when they found
out they were infected. Most of them are still going along with
their activities but with the knowledge that they are playing
Russian roulette and don't know when or if the gun will go off.''
   Making factor VIII free of HIV was expensive and the cost of
therapy has increased 10-fold since the discovery of AIDS. Routine
treatment of a patient with severe hemophilia can now range from
$50,000 to $100,000 a year.

   The family of a 13-year-old girl screamed
and shouted obscenities after a jury convicted a Long Island
neighbor of brutally murdering her.
   Robert Golub, 22, sat quietly at the defense table after the
verdict Tuesday while Kelly Ann Tinyes' relatives yelled
obscenities at him.
   Kelly's battered, slashed body was found in the Golubs' basement
March 4, 1989, a day after she disappeared. Prosecutors said Golub
lured her there with a phone call, then beat, strangled and
sexually mutilated her.
   Kelly's mother, Victoria Tinyes, pounded the railing in front of
her and screamed.
   ``Are you happy now with what you did? Are you happy now?'' she
cried at the Golub family.
   Golub's sister Adele, sitting with her parents, stood up and
shouted, ``I didn't do anything!''
   ``You know what you did,'' yelled a Tinyes supporter.
   Court officers ushered the Tinyes family out.
   The convicted murderer's parents cried as their son was led away
in handcuffs. They left the courthouse without speaking to
reporters.
   ``I'm just sorry I didn't get my hands on him,'' Kelly's
grandfather, Victor Giordonello, said outside the courtroom later.
   Nassau County Court Judge Marvin I. Goodman ordered that Golub
be evaluated by a psychiatrist before his sentencing June 1. He
faces up to 25 years to life in prison.
   Since the arrest of the elder Golub son, Tinyes family members
have verbally confronted the Golubs, who live four houses away on a
tree-lined road in suburban Valley Stream.
   Neighbors have ostracized the Golubs, shouting ``Evil!'' and
``Animals!'' as they went in and out of their home.
   The two families attended court daily during the nine-week
trial; neither family returned home Tuesday night, staying with
relatives instead.
   During the trial, court officers occasionally had to restrain
Tinyes relatives when they verbally attacked the Golubs in the
halls. In one fracas, a Tinyes supporter shouted at the Golubs,
``Your son belongs in a cage!''
   Several neighbors who refused to give their names said they
hoped the Golubs would move.
   ``Time has come now for them to move out,'' said one woman. ``We
don't want them in our neighborhood. That's the only unfinished
business.''
   Eggs have been smashed against their front door, their windows
have been broken and fires have been set in their garbage cans.
   Defense attorney David Grossman said an appeal was being
considered.

<HEAD>10 Newspapers Cited as Examples of Excellence by ASNE</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten small newspapers have been cited as
examples of excellence by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Chosen from newspapers with less than 50,000 circulation were:
The Bradenton (Fla.) Herald; Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo.; The
Times in Gainesville, Ga.; Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald; La Crosse
(Wis.) Tribune; The Capital Times in Madison, Wis.; The Sun News in
Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Naples (Fla.) Daily News; The Day in New
London, Conn.; and the West County Times in Pinole, Calif.
   ``I think this is one of the most thorough evaluations of small
newspapers ever undertaken,'' said Jim Herman, editor of the
Traverse City Record-Eagle in Michigan and chairman of the
society's excellence in small newspaper project since its inception
two years ago.
   ``Our goal is to find small newspapers that are doing
outstanding jobs and to learn from them.''
   Herman said ASNE's selection process began last fall when 1,356
small daily newspapers were invited to compete. More than 450
newspapers were submitted for consideration and regional judges
narrowed that field to 74 finalists, he said.
   In January, 13 judges gathered at the Poynter Institute in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and selected the 10 winners. The judges included
editors, journalism educators and readers.
   ``The papers were graded on a wide range of criteria,'' Herman
said. ``One of the most important was that they have an independent
style and that they have a strong sense of place.''
   It was the second year ASNE has honored excellent small
newspapers. Last year, 14 were chosen.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today there are indications the Soviet Union may be considering a
referendum in Lithuania as a way of shaping the future of the
independence-minded Baltic republic.
   But Baker also registered ``a degree of concern'' about the
Lithuanian situation as he prepared to begin three days of talks
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker is hoping Shevardnadze's visit will produce a plan for a
peaceful settlement in Lithuania as well as a date for the next
superpower summit meeting and progress on U.S.-Soviet arms control
accords.
   At the State Department, Baker said Lithuania ``will be at the
very top of the issues we will be discussing.'' Talking to
reporters after a meeting with West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, he said ``we are anxious to see these
developments proceed peacefully and be resolved through dialogue.''
   Baker was buoyed by the meeting Alexandr N. Yakolev, a close
adviser to Gorbachev, held in Moscow on Tuesday with a delegation
of officials from Lithuania.
   ``There would appear, at least, to be the beginnings of such a
dialogue,'' Baker said. ``... We are encouraged as well that we see
references coming from both sides to the concept of the possibility
of some sort of a referendum approach.''
   A Soviet foreign ministry official, appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America,'' reaffirmed the Kremlin's pledge to deal with the
secessionists in a peaceful way.
   ``Mr. Shevardnadze will certainly describe our attitude and
reiterate our intention to work toward resolution of the situation
through dialogue and in a peaceful manner,'' said Vitaly Churkin,
an adviser to the foreign minister.
   Last Thursday, Lithuanian leaders informed the Kremlin they were
ready to discuss the issue of a referendum on secession if
Gorbachev agreed to talk with them. The Soviet leader, having
demanded the nullification of a March 11 declaration of
independence, did not respond immediately.
   But the meeting with Yakolev indicated the two sides may be
trying to find a way out of the impasse created by the declaration
and Gorbachev's refusal to accept it. Baker's remarks today
suggested he shared in that judgment.
   Also on the agenda is the war in Angola between the Soviet-armed
government and U.S.-aided rebels. Baker is trying for a cease-fire
but insists on a commitment from the Luanda government that it will
share power with the UNITA guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi.
   Before the opening round beginning late this afternoon, U.S.
officials had no word on whether Shevardnadze brought a reply from
Gorbachev to Bush's letter last week reiterating U.S. hopes for a
peaceful settlement in Lithuania.
   But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they hoped Gorbachev and Shevardnadze would spell out how the
Soviets plan to come to grips with the secessionist movement in the
Baltic republic.
   Arriving here Tuesday, Shevardnadze likened events in Lithuania
to an earthquake, but he also pledged to engage in ``honest
dialogue'' with the independence movement.
   While the foreign minister's remarks had a conciliatory ring, he
also emphasized the importance the Kremlin attaches to the Soviet
Constitution and Soviet laws.
   ``You must understand the importance of that question for the
Soviet Union and the Soviet people,`` Shevardnadze said.
   Bush and Baker have no intention of scrapping plans for the
summit over Lithuania, officials said. The selection of a precise
date in June depends on the Soviets scheduling a People's Congress
in Moscow the same month.
   Bush and Gorbachev hope during the summit to sign an accord to
limit their long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.
However, claims that the overall cutback would amount to 50 percent
came under challenge on Tuesday.
   A senior administration official, declining to be identified,
told The Associated Press the United States would wind up with only
slightly fewer deployed warheads than in the current arsenals. When
warheads kept in storage are taken into account, he said, the U.S.
total actually would exceed the current level.
   The official said that from the U.S. standpoint the principal
virtue of the treaty would be to force a reduction in long-range
Soviet SS-18 missiles.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the
treaty would cut the SS-18 force in half and also reduce the total
of deployed Soviet missiles by about half.
   ``The treaty is based on equality,'' she said, reading from a
statement. ``Since Soviet force levels exceed our own in the most
dangerous and destabilizing systems, their reductions will be
somewhat larger.''

<HEAD>President Promises Medellin Leader No Extradition</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New thruout to UPDATE with president saying Medellin leader
will not be extradited to U.S. if he surrenders. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco today said the
leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel will not be extradited to the
United States if he turns himself in.
   It was the first time Barco had made such a promise to a drug
trafficking suspect since he ordered a government crackdown on
traffickers in August.
   Barco made the offer to the Medellin leader, Pablo Escobar, in
an interview with the Colombian radio network RCN.
   ``Mr. Escobar has said that he is going to give himself up, and
I say that if he surrenders I guarantee the judges will judge him
with complete impartiality,'' Barco said, referring to Colombian
courts.
   In the last seven months, the Barco government has extradited 15
trafficking suspects to the United States.
   Like all other trafficking suspects, Escobar faces no drug
charges in Colombia. He does face several murder charges, including
one for the slaying of a newspaper publisher, Guillermo Cano.
   Cano was killed in a submachine-gun attack in front of his
Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador on Dec. 17, 1987. The
newspaper had been crusading for government action against drug
traffickers.
   In the interview today, Barco guaranteed Escobar a fair trial in
Colombia.
   No major drug trafficker has ever been tried, convicted,
sentenced and imprisoned in Colombia on any charge.
   Seventy-five judges have been killed in Colombia in the last 12
years. Many of them were handling drug trafficking cases. It also
is common knowledge in Colombia that some federal judges can be
bribed. Several judges are dismissed each year for corruption.
   Cocaine bosses bent on halting extraditions have stepped up
their terror campaign. On Monday and Tuesday, traffickers killed at
least 12 police officers in and around Medellin, officials said.
   Last week, traffickers threatened to set off a bomb in Bogota
for each new extradition. The threat was issued after the
government extradited to the United States a drug suspect following
a two-week hiatus.
   The chief of the national police, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla,
told reporters late Tuesday that police reinforcements would be
sent to Medellin to handle the increased violence.
   In January, the Medellin cartel curtailed attacks while making
peace overtures. It said its leading figures were willing to
surrender if the government promised not to extradite them to the
United States.
   Barco's government rejected the offer at the time.
   Early Tuesday, two gunmen pulled Sen. Frederico Estrada from his
car in Medellin and fled with him in another vehicle, police Chief
Col. Alberto Otalora told a news conference.
   Anonymous callers to news media said the Medellin cocaine cartel
had kidnapped Estrada and would release him soon with a message for
the government. Otalora said Estrada had opposed traffickers'
attempts to persuade the government to open peace talks.
   Police said the Medellin cartel has offered $4,290 for each
national police officer killed in Bogota and Medellin, and $100,000
for each member of an elite 2,000-man anti-narcotics unit. No
members of that force have been killed.
   The cartel also threatened last week to resume killing
government officials, judges, police and the owners of El
Espectador.
   On Tuesday, El Espectador said in a front-page statement it
would suspend its entire editorial column until the government
gives the paper adequate protection.
   The editorial column, often filled with denunciations of
traffickers, was a strip of blank, white paper two columns wide and
12 inches long.

<HEAD>Cell Transplant Gets Diabetic off Insulin Temporarily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A transplant of insulin-producing cells enabled
a woman with diabetes to go without daily insulin injections for
more than two weeks, say researchers at Washington University.
   However, after that period, the woman's body began to reject the
transplant, doctors said.
   Researchers David Scharp and Paul Lacy said Tuesday that the
case was the first time transplanted cells temporarily eliminated
the need for insulin injections in a patient with juvenile-onset
diabetes. Researchers previously had only been able to reduce the
need for insulin, they said.
   The results were announced in the April issue of the journal
Diabetes.
   The 36-year-old patient was one of several given a pancreatic
islet cell transplant during pilot clinical trials at Washington
University School of Medicine and Barnes Hospital in St. Louis.
   Islets are pockets of hormone-producing tissue that release
insulin.
   The transplanted cells, injected into the patient's liver, were
removed from the islets of two cadaver pancreases.
   Jay S. Skyler, vice president of the American Diabetes
Association and professor of medicine at the University of Miami,
said the study was promising, but he cautioned that it was only one
step toward a cure.
   ``We still have a ways to go,'' Skyler said. ``Now we've got to
figure out why it's only temporary.''
   Skyler noted that researchers have been able to reverse diabetes
in rodents using this procedure since 1972 but until now had been
unsuccessful in applying it to humans.
   ``It's an exciting step, one that's been elusive for a very long
time,'' Skyler said. ``It was almost getting to the point that many
people were getting totally discouraged that the corner would ever
be turned.''
   Scharp also warned that it might be years before islet cell
transplantation became a routine treatment for diabetics.
   ``We are immensely pleased that the grafted tissue was able to
satisfy all of the patient's insulin requirements before it was
rejected,'' said Scharp, who conducted the transplant. ``Our first
trials, in 1985, were designed to determine that islet transplants
were safe. In this study, our primary goal was to determine if we
could isolate, purify and transplant enough islets to bring a
patient completely off of insulin.''
   Within 10 days of the transplant, the patient no longer required
daily insulin injections, according to hourly blood-sugar tests.
She remained independent of insulin until the 25th day, when
evidence of tissue rejection appeared, and she began to require
gradually increasing amounts of supplemental insulin.
   The case ``shows that islet transplantation is a feasible
approach to controlling insulin-dependent diabetes and clearly
establishes the need to move on to larger clinical trials,'' said
Lacy, a pathologist at Washington University who devised many of
the techniques used to isolate and purify human islet cells.
   Lacy said the researchers hope to draw on previous research to
find ways to combat rejection of the cells.

<HEAD>Millionaire Takes Aim at Fast-Food Fat Content</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's and other fast food chains should
give customers a break and reduce saturated fats in their products,
said full-page ads placed today by a multimillionaire who lobbies
against heart-threatening foods.
   Advertisements appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York
Times, USA Today and at least 10 other major newspapers
proclaiming: ``McDonald's, Your Hamburgers Have Too Much Fat!''
   Phil Sokolof, an Omaha businessman who has waged a one-man
campaign against highly saturated fats in processed foods, called
on McDonald's Corp. and other restaurants to reduce the fat content
of their hamburger meat by 10 percent.
   About five newspapers declined to run the ad, Sokolof said in an
interview. The ad singles out McDonald's because it is the industry
leader, but Burger King and Wendy's also use too much fat, he said
in an interview.
   The Los Angeles Times rejected the ad because it violates a
policy of not accepting advertising that is a direct attack on
another company or individual, said Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for
the newspaper.
   McDonald's reacted with outrage.
   ``I think this kind of advertising is sensational, ridiculous,
and I think it's reckless,'' McDonald's senior vice president Dick
Starmann said from Oak Brook, Ill.
   ``I'm surprised that McDonald's is singled out because over the
years we are the ones who have led the way in reducing fats in our
menus,'' he said. ``We think we have the leanest hamburger meat
available today.''
   McDonald's serves 22 million people a day and has 11,000
restaurants in 52 countries.
   A Burger King spokeswoman said Sokolof praised that company four
years ago when it began frying onion rings and fish in vegetable
oil.
   ``The only product that we use a combination of animal fat and
vegetable oil is french fries because our customers say they prefer
it that way,'' Cori Zywotow said.
   Sokolof, 67, blames high cholesterol for a near-fatal heart
attack he suffered 24 years ago. He started the National Heart
Savers Association in 1985 and it is supported largely through his
own contributions.
   After he launched a national advertising campaign in 1988, nine
major food processors, including Nabisco, Kellogg's, Pepperidge
Farm and Keebler, agreed to begin phasing out cholestorol-elevating
fats from products such as crackers, cookies, candies, cereals,
cooking ingredients and TV dinners.
   Today's advertisement said more than half of all Americans have
too much cholesterol in their blood and 25 percent have dangerously
high levels.
   It said a McDonald's Big Mac with french fries contains 25 grams
of saturated fat while a lean beef sandwich has only 3 grams of
saturated fat.
   Starmann countered that a Big Mac with french fries contains
about 19 grams of saturated fat. McDonald's uses a combination of
beef tallow and vegetable shortening to cook its fries but is
testing cholesterol-free vegetable shortening that would eliminate
beef tallow, he added.

   The anti-drug rallies of a controversial civil
rights leader drew small crowds until he started paying people $5
each to attend, a former associate testified.
   ``I'd tell him what the count was and he'd give me the money and
I'd go out and pay everybody,'' Kevin Watkins, the former office
manager for the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Youth Movement, said
Tuesday of the highly publicized rallies.
   ``And what was the payment?'' Assistant Attorney General Victor
Genecin asked.
   ``Five dollars apiece,'' Watkins replied.
   Watkins, who left the group in 1987, testified at Sharpton's
fraud trial in Manhattan state Supreme Court.
   A 67-count indictment against Sharpton alleges that he stole
more than $250,000 in contributions to his youth group, and that he
illegally billed it as a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, from
1985 through 1987.
   Sharpton maintains he never took money from the group he formed
about 20 years ago as a teen-ager.
   Watkins also testified that money raised at a star-studded,
anti-crack dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1986 never made it into
the group's bank account.
   ``We had several arguments about the money from the celebrity
dinner,'' Watkins said. ``He would tell me, `That's my money and I
do what I want with it.'''
   Under cross examination by defense attorney Alton Maddox,
Watkins, an administrative assistant at the Army recruitment
division, said he joined the movement in late 1985 and ``faded
away'' in early 1987.
   He said he was paid $75 a week or about $4,500 in all but did
not report the income on his tax returns. He denied that he was
promised leniency in exchange for his testimony.
   Watkins disputed Sharpton's claims that the National Youth
Movement's 20,000 members provided anti-drug rallies, voter
registration drives and employment services through 15 offices
nationwide.
   Watkins testified that he knew of no members outside about 10
staff people and of no office other than one at St. Mary's Hospital
in Brooklyn.
   ``To this day, I have never heard of the National Youth Movement
outside of New York,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet and Lithuanian officials were heartened
today by a more than three-hour meeting of representatives of the
breakaway republic and a top aide to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri D. Gremitskikh,
called the meeting Tuesday night between a Lithuanian delegation
and Alexander Yakovlev, a progressive member of the Presidential
Council and the Communist Party Politburo, ``a positive sign.''
   It was the first high-level contact between Lithuania and the
Kremlin since the day after the republic declared itself
independent March 11.
   ``I think it's very important that Lithuanian representatives
are aware of the ideas and thoughts that are held here in Moscow,''
Gremitskikh told reporters at a briefing today. ``Our colleagues in
Lithuania just have to tear themselves away from their narrow views
and look at all these problems through the prism of the fact that a
new basis for the federation is being created.''
   In a separate news conference, Ivan D. Laptev, the new head of
the Soviet of the Union, one of two chambers of the Soviet
legislature, said: ``I'm convinced there will be a successful
dialogue.''
   ``A decision will be found that will be satisfactory to both
sides,'' said Laptev, the progressive editor of Izvestia.
   Lithuanian legislator Egidijus Bickauskas said of the meeting:
``We are very, very encouraged.''
   ``If there are people who at least want to listen to us, it's
very good,'' Bickauskas said.
   The clash of wills over Lithuanian independence has included an
order from Gorbachev for Lithuanians to relinquish all weapons, the
arrest by Soviet troops of some Lithuanian deserters, the takeover
of several Vilnius buildings by Soviet soldiers, movements of army
reinforcements and a sharp war of words.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was in Washington
for talks with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and said the Kremlin intended to hold ``honest dialogue'' with
the Lithuanians.
   An expected meeting this morning with Soviet Interior Minister
Vadim Bakatin did not occur, according to a spokeswoman for the
Lithuanian office in Moscow. She was unable to say if it had been
canceled or postponed.
   The Lithuanian legislature, which began meeting in the late
afternoon, was scheduled to respond today to Gorbachev's decree
that the republic renounce its declaration of independence before
any talks begin.
   Suggestions by some Lithuanian Communists that the small Baltic
nation suspend its declaration of independence for six months in
hopes of appeasing Gorbachev were adamantly opposed by members of
the Sajudis pro-independence movement, according to Anatole Lieven
of The Times of London, one of the few correspondents not expelled
from Vilnius by Soviet authorities.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and the overwhelming
majority of Lithuanian citizens interviewed by The Associated Press
over the past two weeks said Soviet military intimidation had not
ebbed their determination for independence.
   ``If somebody expects Lithuania to renounce its independence
act, there will be no such answer,'' Bickauskas said.
   Sajudis planned pro-independence rallies in several Lithuanian
cities tonight, but spokesman Yuri Romanenko said one scheduled for
Vilnius was canceled to prevent a clash with an anti-independence
meeting set for the same spot in front of the parliament building
90 minutes earlier.
   As with earlier anti-independence demonstrations in the
Lithuanian capital, publicity was handled by the Soviet army, which
dropped announcements from a military helicopter on Tuesday,
Romanenko said.
   Gremitskikh also said today that Soviet officials had never
halted their dialogue with Lithuanians, and he specifically cited a
visit to Vilnius by several members of the national parliament.
   The only such trip was taken by a group of democratically minded
deputies who strongly supported Lithuania's bid for independence
and called on Gorbachev to end his intransigence and start
negotiating.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet parliament approved a bill
setting procedures for secession from the Soviet Union. The Soviet
constitution allows republics to secede, but until the legislation
was passed there was no legal mechanism for beginning the procedure.
   The law, which becomes effective when it is published in the
Soviet press, requires two-thirds of a republic's voters to approve
secession in a referendum and calls for a subsequent waiting period
of up to five years while the Soviet Union and the republic
negotiate terms of secession.
   Bickauskas said Lithuania had no means of implementing its
proclaimed independence if Soviet soldiers continued to interfere
in the republic.
   ``We have declared independence, but we very well know that
tanks are moving on our soil every day and night, and they take
over one building after another,'' he said.
   ``We realize the Soviet Union has economic, political and
military interests in Lithuania that cannot be cut all at once.
These problems involve not only the Soviet Union and Lithuania but
Europe and the whole world. So we need to talk. We want somebody to
hold a dialogue with us,'' Bickauskas said.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev said secession talks could take place if
Lithuania renounced the independence declaration. Landsbergis
responded Monday that Lithuania did not intend to rush toward
freedom and invited a Moscow representative for talks in Vilnius.

<HEAD>Guards Sue To Bar More Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guards at Graterford State Prison have sued
the state, claiming they are endangered by overcrowding in the
nation's fifth largest prison.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Commonwealth Court, asks the court
to order the state to reduce the prison's population to ``safer,
more manageable levels.'' It also asks for improvements in the
prison's sewage, water and electrical facilities.
   The lawsuit is believed to be the nation's first by prison
guards seeking to relieve prison crowding, said Michael Fox,
assistant to the executive director of Council 13 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. AFSCME is the
union for state prison employees.
   The Department of Corrections declined to comment until it sees
the suit, spokeswoman Sherri Cadeaux said.
   The 61-year-old, 62-acre, maximum-security prison northwest of
Philadelphia has a capacity of 2,734 inmates. Tuesday, it held
4,212 inmates, including 510 serving life sentences and 24 on death
row, prison spokesman Alan J. LeFebvre said.
   They are controlled by 506 corrections officers, Lefebvre said.
   But 65 guard positions are unfilled because the state can't find
anyone to work for the $17,200 starting salary, Lefebvre said.
   ``The concern is that the inmates could take over if they wanted
to,'' Fox said.
   ``We are hoping we can relieve it before it gets to that
point,'' LeFebvre said. He said the crowding causes long waiting
lines for meals, food shortages, delays, equipment breakdowns and a
higher level of tension.
   Vince Carocci, spokesman for Gov. Robert P. Casey, who is named
in the lawsuit, said Casey has proposed spending $180 million for
3,000 new prison cells. Carocci said the state also has accelerated
hiring of guards and is ``exploring the salary issue.''
   A class-action lawsuit on behalf of the inmates charging that
the crowding violates their constitutional rights was dismissed in
federal court, LeFebvre said.

<HEAD>Genscher Rejects Soviet Proposal to Neutralize Reunited Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich
Genscher opened a round of meetings with top U.S. officials today,
rejecting a Soviet proposal to neutralize a reunited Germany.
   Emerging from a meeting at the State Department with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, Genscher repeated his nation's stand
that a unified Germany should remain a partner in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``A neutralized Germany would not contribute to stability in
Europe,'' he said. ``On the contrary, it would increase
instability.''
   ``We want to see German unification making a contribution to
stability in Europe,'' he said.
   Baker then escorted Genscher to the White House for a meeting
with President Bush.
   Genscher and Baker told reporters that the timing of the
so-called two-plus-four meetings on German unification depend on
the organization of the East German government following its recent
national elections.
   The participants in the negotiations include both German nations
plus the four nations that emerged victorious after World War II:
the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   The formula still under discussion is a device to compromise the
Soviets' initial demand for neutralization of its World War II
enemy and to allay concerns among Germany's neighbors who sufffered
devastation at the hands of the Nazis.
   Genscher has taken the lead in promoting the continuation of a
unified Germany in NATO with a concession to the Soviet Union that
Western troops would not be moved into what is now East Germany.
   The West German foreign minister offered his government's thanks
to the United States for its support of the German unification
process.
   He said West Germany is determined that the process proceed with
``full openness'' and with complete consultation with his nation's
allies and neighbors.
   ``We don't want to act behind the backs of others,'' Genscher
said.
   ``We are interested in and we intend to see German unification
making a contribution to civility in Western Europe,'' he said.
   Baker said he and Genscher discussed a wide range of issues,
including the problems posed by German unification, conventional
arms control and the possibility of a 35-nation summit meeting this
year, as proposed by Soviet Presidzent Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Bush administration already has endorsed the summit idea,
but only if a treaty, now being negotiated between NATO and the
Warsaw pact to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear weapons
in Europe, is ready for signing.

<HEAD>City Council Votes for Needle Cleaning Kit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in the nation's second-largest city
approved the distribution of chlorine bleach for cleaning needles
to slow the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users.
   The council vote was unanimous Tuesday after an emotional
hearing in which one unidentified man was escorted from chambers
when he tried to shout down supporters of the program.
   The $25,000 allocated for distribution of kits containing bleach
and condoms was part of an $85,000 AIDS prevention and education
program. The bleach kills the AIDS virus on needles, which drug
addicts often share.
   The money also establishes a central AIDS treatment and
information center.
   San Francisco is the only other governmental agency in
California that distributes bleach to clean needles. New York also
distributes bleach _ and recently withdrew from a program to
distribute clean needles.
   Critics of the programs charge they promote drug abuse.
Supporters say drug abuse will continue regardless of whether
needles are sterilized to prevent AIDS.
   Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS policy and program coordinator,
estimated that 7 percent of intravenous drug users in Los Angeles
County carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The City Administrative Office said the $25,000 will pay for
50,000 to 62,000 bleach and condom kits. City officials said they
had no way of estimating how many intravenous drug users would use
the kits.

   Singer Gloria Estefan left a hospital today, two
weeks after a bus crash broke her spine, and the Miami Sound
Machine vocalist promised she would soon be back performing at
``100 percent.''
   Estefan thanked doctors, nurses and staff at the Orthopedic
Institute Hospital for Joint Disease for their work in ``putting me
back together.''
   She called the experience ``the most difficult thing in my
life,'' and said she was ``thankful for the miracle of being
alive.''
   The singer faced reporters, cameras and hospital workers from a
wheelchair. But she ended her news conference by standing, unaided.
   Estefan, 32, was injured March 21 when her tour bus was struck
by a tractor-trailer on an icy Pennsylvania highway while en route
to a performance. She was transferred to the hospital one day
later, and doctors implanted two steel rods to stabilize the area
where she broke vertebrae.
   ``All the positive prayers and thoughts sent my way helped me in
my recuperation,'' said Estefan, who was accompanied by her husband
Emilio. The couple's 9-year-old son also was injured in the crash.
   Doctors have estimated it could take up to six months for her to
fully recover.

   The governor of Strangeways Prison
said today he was holding difficult negotiations with a dwindling
band of rebellious inmates that still controlled part of the prison.
   One prisoner died Tuesday of injuries suffered during a riot at
a Sunday chapel service, and prison governor Brendan O'Friel said
he feared that another fatality may come to light as guards regain
control of the prison.
   Fewer than a hundred prisoners still held control of the upper
floors of four wings today, following a third night without heat or
light in the ravaged cellblocks. Up to two dozen inmates occupied
prison roofs today, and one group hung up a banner that said ``No
Peace.''
   ``We're now in a delicate and difficult situation ... but my
hope is that these negotiations will result in a peaceful end to
this incident,'' O'Friel told reporters.
   He commended his staff for containing an ``explosion of evil''
on Sunday, when he said more than 1,500 inmates were out of control.
   The editor of the Manchester Evening News, who spent 10 hours
inside the prison Tuesday as a neutral observer requested by the
prisoners, said inmates complained of ``mental and physical
brutality, misuse of drugs in controlling prisoners, poor food and
cramped conditions.''
   In a story published in today's edition of the News, editor
Michael Unger said the areas he saw were devastated.
   ``Strewn around the stench-filled wings were smashed toilets,
wrecked television sets, ripped-out telephones, and huge steel
doors ripped off their hinges. Water was pouring down, and the
stink of burning was almost too much to bear,'' Unger wrote.
   Ivor Serle, a guard and chairman of the local Prison Officers'
Association branch, said about 20 ``hard core of the hard core''
prisoners were stopping other inmates from giving up.
   Serle said 68 inmates were still on the loose. A spokesman for
the Home Office, whose jurisdiction includes prisons, put the
figure at under 40.
   Thirteen guards were hurt by flying bricks, poles and other
objects on Tuesday as they tried to regain control, Serle said, and
six had to be hospitalized.
   Manchester-born Derek White, 46, died Tuesday in North
Manchester Hospital after suffering head wounds and chest pains. He
had been jailed at Strangeways while awaiting trial on charges of
indecent assault and sodomy.
   In English prisons, sex offenders, child molesters and convicted
policemen are among inmates kept apart from other prisoners for
their own safety.
   White was among a group of 50 such prisoners being held in a
segregated wing when other prisoners at a religious service in the
prison on Sunday overpowered guards and took their keys.
   The rioting prisoners used the keys to gain access to large
areas of the prison, including the segregated section.
   Officials said they attacked White and other members of the
group and in a general rampage through the prison started fires,
smashed fixtures and got onto the roof, tearing off tiles and
hurling them down at guards.
   British newspapers have speculated that up to 30 people may have
been killed in the rioting, although officials say such reports
cannot be confirmed as long as parts of the prison are still held
by inmates.
   The father of a youth who was in the same wing as sex offenders,
segregated because of his age but on a different landing, said on
BBC-TV news Tuesday that his son told him he witnessed six murders.
The youth was transferred to a jail in the south of England where
the father said he saw him on Tuesday.
   The father, who refused to be named and was shown in silhouette,
relayed his son's account of kangaroo courts in which makeshift
ropes made from sheets were tied around the necks of prisoners.
   Inmates' relatives say other factors adding to tension at the
122-year-old prison include overcrowding, with up to three
prisoners in cells built for one, unsanitary conditions and
prisoners locked in cells for up to 23 hours a day.
   With a prison population of 47,000, Britain has the highest
number of inmates per capita in Western Europe.
   Strangeways was built in 1868 to hold 970 men. It had 1,648
prisoners on Sunday. It contains inmates of all categories, from
very dangerous to low risk.

<HEAD>Florida Mayor, Councilman Indicted in Racketeering Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez surrendered to the FBI
today on charges that he conspired with a city councilman to extort
payoffs from developers in exchange for approving zoning changes on
properties.
   Gov. Bob Martinez on Tuesday suspended both Martinez and
Councilman Andres Mejides without pay after they were indicted by a
federal grand jury following a five-year investigation into the
operation of the state's fifth-largest city.
   ``These are extremely serious charges that go to the very
essence of trust in government, and the people of Hialeah deserve
to know that their officials have the public's best interest in
mind at all times,'' said the governor, who is not related to the
mayor. ``Until these charges can be resolved, these two officials
should not hold their positions of trust.''
   Both city officials and were scheduled to appear this afternoon
before a federal magistrate.
   ``Martinez obtained benefits, including money and property for
himself and others, by expressly using and threatening to use the
powers of his office as Mayor of the city of Hialeah,'' the
indictment said.
   Raul Martinez, 41, was named in two Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organization counts, along with seven extortion-related counts, and
faces a maximum 180 years in prison and fines of $2.25 million,
said Marcella Cohen, first assistant U.S. attorney.
   ``Keep the faith and at the end, I am going to prevail because I
am innocent,'' Raul Martinez said in a message to constituents
Tuesday.
   Mejides, 51, also was named in the two racketeering counts,
along with four counts of obtaining property by extortion, and
faces maximum penalties of 120 years and fines of $1.5 million.
   The government also claims that Martinez must forfeit $900,000
in property and cash that he allegedly obtained from racketeering
activities. Mejides must forfeit $24,000 in property, the
government said.
   City council president Julio Martinez, who is not related to
either the governor or suspended mayor, was sworn in late Tuesday
as acting mayor.
   Former city council candidates Paulino Nunez and Evelio Medina,
who were the highest unelected vote-getters in the last city
election, were sworn in to fill the resulting council vacancies.
   The indictment Tuesday also named several other current and
former Hialeah officials as unindicted co-conspirators. The
indictment charges that between 1981 and 1987 half of the city's
eight elected officials repeatedly shook down developers and
builders seeking to rezone property in Hialeah.
   Raul Martinez has been mayor of the predominantly Hispanic
working-class city of more than 200,000 residents since 1981. He
was handily re-elected to a fifth term in November after a campaign
in which opponents raised the issue of his real estate dealings.
   The mayor replied that he had been under federal scrutiny for
years, but apparently without any finding of wrongdoing. He has
charged the investigations were politically motivated.

   March 30
   El Paso (Texas) Herald-Post on child care:
   George Bush has promised to veto any child-care bill that
discriminates against religious or church-based day care. His
forthright commitment emboldens us to hope that good sense will
prevail on this contentious issue, despite the inscrutable ways of
Congress. ...
   Purists on the separation of church and state see this as a
matter of principle. ... Let a tax dollar flow to a religious
child-care center, and Calvin's Geneva is just around the corner.
   In fact, the use of child-care vouchers to pay for religious
care would no more threaten the First Amendment than the hugely
successful GI Bill, which covered veterans' costs at public and
sectarian colleges alike. ...
   If even a fraction of eligible parents find in church
congregations an extended family to help nurture their children,
should the government discourage them?
   Whatever child-care bill emerges from the House of
Representatives vote, the White House should scrutinize the process
of reconciling House and Senate versions. Bush should restate his
insistence that parents have a right to choose religious day care _
and follow up his pledge with a veto if need be.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on the S&amp;L bailout:
   While some of the nation's observers are running around saying,
``What are we going to do?'' about S&amp;L failures and bailouts,
several congressmen are doing something about it. They have
introduced legislation to limit compensation packages at federally
insured depository institutions.
   Enacting this one relatively minor adjustment could save
taxpayers a substantial sum.
   In some cases, the failure of financial institutions is attended
by bailouts for high officers. Perhaps the best example is the top
management of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a Wall Street securities
firm, which handed out some $350 million in bonuses just before
filing for bankruptcy.
   Creditors rather than taxpayers were hurt by that payoff, but
the potential is there for institutions backed by federally insured
deposits. The proposed legislation would limit such golden
parachutes at those institutions.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman William Siedman told a
House subcommittee that his agency needs more authority to prevent
excessive compensation at weakened institutions that are still
operating.
   The FDIC should be given all the authority it needs to protect
taxpayers, and then Congress and the president should make sure it
uses it effectively toward that end.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on fuel efficiency:
   Arguments for fuel efficiency are about basic common sense. Yet
for years the simple wisdom of conserving something that is in
limited supply escaped America.
   It was too complex for Ronald Reagan. His administration was
determined to foil a 1975 law mandating higher fuel-efficiency
standards.
   Thanks to White House clout and Reagan's backward thinking, the
standard Congress originally planned for 1985-model fleets wasn't
in place until the 1990-model cars.
   The victory went to Detroit lobbyists. The loss went to a nation
that is increasingly dependent on imported oil and increasingly
swaddled in air pollution. It was a commitment to waste in a world
that must learn to conserve finite sources of energy and develop
renewable ones.
   Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards had a beneficial effect
despite the best efforts of Ronald Reagan and (the) Detroit lobby.
Higher standards kept 360 million tons of carbon dioxide out of the
air just in 1989, according to the Sierra Club. ...
   Higher fuel-efficiency standards are like finding an oil well.
They save resources and blunt arguments about how the nation must
sacrifice every wilderness for the sake of oil exploration. They
reduce both pollution and the need for oil imports. For consumers,
they could lower operating costs _ or at least help offset the
higher gas taxes looming on the horizon.
   There isn't room in an environmentally conscious nation for any
more coddling of automakers who cling to out-of-date ideas. ...
   Congress has to look out for the best interests of the nation,
and provide a real incentive for car makers to offer truly
efficient cars. Higher fuel-efficiency standards are a simple, easy
strategy in a nation that needs to remember that conservation means
more than just doing without.

   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on water shortages:
   As the state enters its fourth drought year, California
officials have imposed new mandatory conservation rules to preserve
water. The rainy season is about over, and snowpack levels are at
less than 63 percent of normal.
   Although California makes the headlines, it shares with East
Coast states and big cities in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico a
problem that goes beyond a few drought years. The problem is that
population and wasteful lifestyles are using up in a few years
aquifer water reservoirs that took thousands of years to fill.
   In some areas, sucking up the pure underground water to drink,
fill swimming pools, irrigate crops, flush toilets, wash cars has
created a vacuum that allowed sea water to seep into the aquifer.
Thus, even the diminishing supply of good water is contaminated. ...
   Misuses of water and excessive population growth have disturbed
political stability in many areas of the world. The most volatile
is the Middle East, where the scramble for more water has upset an
already unstable region. ...
   No single approach will solve the impending water crisis.
Holding down the rate of population growth is critical. So are new
irrigation techniques, a new subsidy policy that discourages
irrigation for crops that can be grown elsewhere, and incentives
and penalties that encourage citizens and industry to conserve.

   China's legislature gave final approval today to
the basic law by which Beijing will govern Hong Kong after 1997,
but Hong Kong politicians immediately demanded it be amended.
   The National People's Congress, which largely rubber-stamps
decisions by top leaders, made no changes of its own in the law,
which was thrashed out over the past five years by a special
Chinese-Hong Kong committee.
   Under the law Hong Kong, which has been ruled by Britain since
1842, is promised a high degree of autonomy within China and
protection of its capitalist economic system for at least 50 years.
However, many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents fear the
guarantees are not strong enough, and they already are emigrating
to escape coming under Communist rule.
   The law provides for a 60-seat local legislature in which 20
members could be directly elected at first, 24 members in 1999 and
30 members in the year 2003. It also sets up a complicated
split-voting procedure that gives appointed legislators power to
veto controversial bills.
   After Hong Kong residents loudly supported last year's massive
pro-democracy protests on the mainland, China added provisions for
declaring a state of emergency in Hong Kong and banned subversive
activities and contacts between Hong Kong and foreign political
groups.
   Hong Kong residents greeted the draft's publication in February
with protests and demands for greater democracy.
   The colony's legislature voted 20-6 today to ask China to change
the law before 1997. China's National People's Congress must
approve any changes.
   Hong Kong legislator Martin Lee, an outspoken proponent of
democratic reforms, said the law as passed was a ``regression''
from earlier versions because of the anti-subversion clauses.
Chinese leaders have said repeatedly they will not allow Hong Kong
to become a base for Chinese dissident activity.
   Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents already have emigrated
because of fear about life under Communist rule, and the pace has
stepped up sharply since China used its army in June to crush the
pro-democracy protests. A survey in August found that two out of
every five residents want to leave.
   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping, however, has praised the
basic law as a ``masterpiece of creativity'' that can ensure
stability after 1997. He said general elections and ``Western
democracy'' were not suitable for Hong Kong.
   The National People's Congress, which approved the basic law by
a vote of 2,660 to 16, with 29 abstentions and eight deputies
failing to vote, also decided to set up a 400-member joint Hong
Kong-mainland committee to prepare for the 1997 transfer.

   Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal on the Idaho abortion bill:
   Abortion activists tossed Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho a hot
potato ... by threatening a boycott of the state's most famous crop
if he didn't veto a bill that would have given that state the
nation's most restrictive abortion law.
   The governor, a longtime abortion foe, caved (in). He claimed
the veto reflected his objection to the law's harsh provisions on
rape cases and its unlikely prospects before the Supreme Court. The
risk of ruining his state's economy must also have played a part,
however.
   There's no question that abortion is both a wrenching moral
issue and a legitimate subject for political debate. But some of
the tactics employed by zealots on either side of the issue
threaten to go beyond free speech or even civil disobedience. They
threaten to undermine the democratic process.
   In the last two presidential races, candidates for the nation's
highest office have faced a constant barrage of heckling and
disruption from abortion foes. Now that the Webster decision has
transferred much of the action to the state level, political
discourse is being held hostage in state races. ...
   Those involved in the issue argue that the fate of some crop is
small potatoes alongside the lives of women or the deaths of the
unborn, but that misses the point.
   No matter how important the abortion issue is to those caught up
in it, the tactic in Idaho threatened to ruin the livelihoods, if
not the lives, of potato farmers. They were innocent bystanders who
had no connection to the debate other than the accident of
depending for their income on a product that could be turned into a
convenient symbol.
   A tactic that attempts to make a political point by ruining the
lives and fortunes of victims selected more or less at random isn't
democracy in action or noble protest. It's a species of terrorism.

   The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J., on hungry children:
   The eventful developments of recent months have made for banner
headlines and historic change in the world. The crumbling of
communism in eastern Europe, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall,
the invasion of Panama, the elections in Chile, the coup attempt in
the Phillipines, to name a few, all have dominated the news.
   And while the world has been watching ..., scant attention is
being paid to the needless deaths of tens of thousands of Third
World children each day from hunger and poverty.
   The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund in
its State of the World's Children-1990 report notes that, if
current trends continue, 100 million children will die in this
decade from illness and malnutrition.
   It also notes that these deaths could be prevented at low cost
if the nations of the world have the will to address the problem. A
host of proposals that UNICEF says could save millions of lives a
year would come with a $2.5 billion annual price tag. The figure is
equivalent to what Soviets spend on vodka, what American companies
spend on cigarette advertisement in a year and 10 percent of the
European Community's annual agriculture subsidy.
   The UNICEF solutions should be seriously addressed. The time is
overdue for the developed nations of the world to demonstrate their
commitment to ending the unnecessary deaths of children _ children
who are dying to know if these nations have the will.

   Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal on the nuclear threat:
   The threat of war between the United States and the Soviet Union
has diminished, but not the threat to world order from other
sources.
   A reminder of that came ... with the arrest in Britain of six
people who were trying to smuggle a triggering device for nuclear
weapons into Iraq.
   This is the new world threat: As tensions ease between the big
powers, the increasing spread of weapons _ of increasing
destructiveness _ can mean that regional conflicts will be
international concerns. Or that smaller, terrorist nations can hold
large powers hostage on their demands. ...
   It is time to put tighter controls on the spread of nuclear
weapons technology and to expand and enforce nuclear proliferation
treaties.

   Beloit (Wis.) Daily News on Japan and the U.S. economy:
   According to a Japanese newspaper, a list of 80 suggestions to
improve the United States economy has been delivered from Tokyo to
Washington.
   The Japanese suggest the United States impose a value-added tax,
abolish income tax deductions on home mortgage loans, build
high-speed trains to reduce the demand for automobiles and even
limit the number of credit cards U.S. citizens can possess.
   The object is to cut the multi-billion-dollar U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
   The United States isn't a basket case just yet, and doesn't need
lectures from the land of the rising sun.
   The Japanese, flush with the economic success of recent years,
shouldn't forget just how dependent their industries are on the
American marketplace. Presumptuous pronouncements of this type just
feed an existing American resentment of Japanese economic policies.
   It also glosses over a key point in the trade deficit situation,
namely, Tokyo's protectionist policies which thwart U.S. companies'
efforts to compete in Japan.
   There may come a day when Tokyo has the economic power to humble
the United States, and dictate fiscal policies. But don't bet on it.

   Imelda Marcos' lawyer says the real estate deals
that led to fraud and racketeering charges against her were
originally suggested by George Bush, and that the CIA knew all
about them.
   Defense attorney Gerald Spence also announced in opening
arguments at Mrs. Marcos' trial Tuesday that he will try to call
President Bush as a witness and will seek a sworn statement from
Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
refused to comment on Spence's allegations.
   A lawyer for Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant, Saudi Arabian arms
dealer Adnan Khashoggi, said today in his opening statement that
his client had committed ``foolish acts'' in his business dealings
but was innocent of fraud charges.
   ``If this wasn't such a serious charge, this would be funny,''
James Linn said in opening arguments. ``It is not the sinister
thing that the government makes it out'' to be.
   Linn admitted that Khashoggi had many personal dealings with
Marcos and that Khashoggi had signed one fake document involving
the buildings, but said this was intended to help a Marcos
associate, not to defraud anyone.
   Khashoggi, 54, once described as the richest man in the world,
was trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose on the
properties, Linn said.
   On Tuesday, a prosecutor portrayed Mrs. Marcos as an
uncontrolled spender who treated the Philippine National Bank as
her ``personal piggy bank.''
   The former Philippine first lady and her husband, Ferdinand,
were indicted in 1988 on charges of stealing millions of dollars
from their homeland's treasury to buy New York City real estate,
jewelry and art. Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in September.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, broke down in tears as Spence described her as
a ``devoted wife'' determined to clear the name of her late husband.
   He denied that Mrs. Marcos had any part in the dealings on which
the charges are based. ``Mrs. Marcos never wrote a check in her
life, she never paid a bill in her life,'' Spence told the jury.
   Spence sought to trace the origins of the New York real estate
deals to CIA concern, in the early 1980s, that the Philippines
would fall to the communists.
   According to Spence, Bush, then vice president, visited Manila
in 1981 and urged Marcos to abandon negotiations with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi on an oil investment deal and put the money instead
into American property.
   ``The evidence in this case is that the CIA was aware of every
transaction that took place in this case,'' Spence said.
   Earlier, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston charged that
the Marcoses were ``partners in crime'' who used accomplices, fake
documents and 13 ``shell corporations'' to steal $168 million in
Philippine government funds and defraud U.S. banks of $165 million
more. She said the couple used some of the money to buy four
expensive pieces of New York real estate and other luxury items.
   She said Mrs. Marcos treated the New York branch of the
Philippine National Bank as her ``own personal piggy bank. Every
time she descended on New York ... she cracked it open, (taking)
bundles and bundles of cash.''
   Livingston said Khashoggi, 54, entered the picture after Mrs.
Aquino replaced Marcos in 1986 and her government won a U.S. court
order to prohibit any further transactions involving the four
buildingss.
   Khashoggi, she said, committed fraud and obstructed justice by
fabricating documents showing that he, not the Marcoses, had owned
the buildings for several years.
   If convicted, Mrs. Marcos could get up to 50 years in prison and
a $1 million fine. Khashoggi, once described as the world's richest
man, could receive up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if
convicted.
   Spence said Mrs. Marcos never lost sight of her humble origins.
   ``She was beloved by the people,'' he said. ``If she took 30
minutes to dress for a head of state, she took an hour to dress for
the little people.''
   Spence said Mrs. Marcos had been unfairly treated for having had
more than 1,000 pairs of shoes, left behind in Manila.
   ``One thing that made up this woman is how long she was
barefoot,'' he said. He added, however, that most of the shoes were
given to her by local shoe manufacturers, ``and most of them didn't
fit.''

<HEAD>Three Doctors Punished in Cash-for-Kidneys Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Medical Council took disciplinary
action Wednesday against three doctors involved in a case in which
four healthy people sold their kidneys for transplant operations.
   The harshest action was taken against Dr. Raymond Crockett. The
council struck him from its register, meaning he may not prescribe
medicine until he is readmitted to the register. He is eligible to
reapply in 10 months.
   The council's Professional Conduct Committee found Crockett and
surgeons Michael Joyce and Michael Bewick guilty of serious
professional misconduct, but Crockett was the only one struck off
the register.
   Joyce and Bewick were found to have failed to comply with
guidelines on making checks on the histories of the patients and
donors.
   Joyce was banned from taking part in kidney transplants for two
years.
   Bewick was ordered to confine his services to the government's
National Health Service for the next three years, and to submit
detailed records of every transplant operation in which he is
involved.
   They have 28 days to appeal.
   ``This whole case has been about the limits to which it is
permissible for a doctor to go to save lives. That's all I have
ever tried to do,'' Crockett said after the hearing. ``My concern
was with four of my patients who were going to die without an
urgent transplant.''
   The committee chairman, Sir Robert Kilpatrick, told Crockett his
conduct ``brought disgrace upon yourself and dishonor upon medical
practice in the United Kingdom.''
   During a 35-day hearing, the board heard allegations that
Crockett arranged for kidneys to be transplanted from four healthy
Turks into patients in London.
   Turkish authorities said the donors were paid $3,200 to $5,600.
   Ata Nur Kunter, who has been identified as the broker in the
transactions, was not called to testify.
   ``Everybody knows, if you have money, you can buy a kidney,''
Kunter said in an interview Wednesday with Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency.
   ``The GMC obviously don't want to hear my story and I have
always suspected that there must be a reason,'' Kunter said.
   ``The GMC accuses me of being a kidney broker and of lying, and
none of it is true,'' Kunter added.
   A spokesman for the medical council, who was not identified,
said the committee had been advised by attorneys that it would be
``inappropriate'' to call Kunter to testify.
   Kunter introduced the four donors _ Ahmet Koc, Ferhat Usta,
Natice Anutkan and Coskun Yenici _ to Crockett and said Crockett
paid him to act as an interpreter.
   ``Four willing Turkish donors were presented to me and were
fully assessed as fit and willing to give one of their kidneys,''
Crockett said. ``The General Medical Council found all these donors
freely consented.''
   Crockett said he believed his actions were correct _ ``right
before my patients and right before my peers.''
   ``I believe the question of money was largely irrelevant,''
Crockett said. ``And I do not accept in any regard that I was
guilty of misconduct in any form.''

   The Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal

   The proposal, if approved by the National Assembly, would bar
4-wheel-drive vehicles, cross-country motorcycles and other
vehicles in areas such as sand dunes, marshes and mountain pastures.
   Brice Lalonde, secretary of state for the environment, told the
Cabinet that the number of off-road vehicles in France had
increased six-fold to 140,000 in the past eight years. He said the
number was expected to triple by 1995.
   The proposed law was drafted because of concern that the
off-road vehicles posed a threat to hikers and to the environment.

   A prosecutor filed charges Wednesday
against two shipping agents suspected of violating Swedish trade
sanctions against South Africa.
   The trial is due to start in May. It would be the first time a
Swedish court has heard a case based on the 1987 trade ban, which
was imposed because of South African apartheid.
   Prosecutor Curt Bokelund said he filed charges against the
general manager and a clerk of Gemini Shipping Agency in Goteborg.
The charges allege the defendants arranged eight deliveries of iron
wire to Durban, South Africa via Hamburg, West Germany, from
November 1987 to March 1989.
   The defendants face two years in prison if convicted. Their
names were not released. Bokelund said both defendants denied the
charges.

   Germans are not only steering

   There have been about 10,000 accidents between West German and
East German vehicles since the start of the year, the HUK
association of West German auto insurers said Wednesday.
   Before East Germany opened its borders in November, the average
annual rate was about 4,500, according to the insurers' group.
   Insurance settlements are often complicated by the nations'
different laws.
   HUK said it and East Germany's state-owned insurers have agreed
to streamline their claim procedures to make awarding of
settlements simpler and quicker.
   HUK did not say how many casualties there were in the 10,000
crashes.

   A Moslem man dived into a river
and swam away to escape authorities who caught him smoking and
drinking in violation of the Ramadan fast, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
   A police official, Ahmad Zaki, said officers of the Religious
Department caught the man breaking the Ramadan rules at a stall in
Kuala Selangor town, 60 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, on Tuesday.
   They were questioning him when he bolted, leaving behind his
cigarettes, Ahmad was quoted as telling the Star newspaper. The
officers chased the man, but he jumped into the muddy Kuala
Selangor river, swam away and hid behind some boats. The officers
waited for an hour, then gave up and left.
   Ahmad said his officers also raided an office in Kuala Selangor
on Tuesday and found several people drinking. They all jumped out
of a window and escaped.
   However, he said, officers arrested 15 people consuming food and
drinks at Pekan Tanjong Karang, near Kuala Selangor. They are to
appear in court after Ramadan ends April 27.
   During the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, Moslems are to abstain
from eating, drinking, and smoking from sunrise to sunset. The
elderly, ill, and children are exempt.
   About half of Malaysia's 17.5 million people are Moslems. Under
Malaysian law, fines for violating Ramadan range from $18 to $73.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Lithuania:
   In shaping a response to the Soviet Union's secession crisis,
George Bush has wisely avoided the mistake of excessive
interference. But his moderation leads him to err in the opposite
direction.
   Bush has been so discreet in expressing sympathy for the cause
of Lithuanian independence that one would hardly guess he endorses
the American policy of 50 years' standing: that the Soviet Union's
forcible annexation of the Baltic states, Lithuania, Estonia and
Latvia, through a secret deal with Hitler, was never legal.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says he is committed to
transforming his government into one based on law and consent. If
so, President Bush will do no harm by reiterating what our country
has always stood for.
   The brave Lithuanians suffered foreign domination for 50 years.
Now they have elected a parliament that voted unanimously for
independence. Their government is acting with dignity. In their
vastly unequal face-off with the Soviet Union, they deserve the
moral support of the United States.

   The Los Angeles Times on capital punishment:
   A few minutes after 3 a.m. (Tuesday) in the darkest watch of the
night, the penalty imposed long ago for (Robert) Harris' callous
murder of two teen-age boys finally would have been carried out.
But Monday's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a stay
granted by the Court of Appeals stopped the clock _ at least for
now _ at 1 minute to 3.
   For more than 20 years, California has kept a kind of death
watch of its own. Those who favor capital punishment _ as 78
percent of Californians do _ and those who oppose it _ as The Times
does _ have waged a wrenching, often bitter struggle over this
divisive issue. ...
   But had this ... scheduled execution gone forward, what would
have been accomplished beyond Robert Harris' death? The two young
men he murdered will not be returned to life, nor will the hearts
of their families and friends be made whole. ...
   Would others have been deterred from murder by this killer's
execution? According to a global survey of capital punishment
conducted in 1988 by the United Nations, ``the evidence as a whole
gives no positive support to the deterrence hypothesis.'' That is
one reason, among many, why no other Western democracy maintains an
active death sentence. ...
   Finally, all that can be said is that life dealt cruelly with
Robert Alton Harris, that he dealt cruelly with others and that the
state may yet deal cruelly with him. Reasonable people will differ
on whether there is any justice in that, but none can say there is
either goodness or mercy.

   Stillwater (Minn.) Evening Gazette on Bush and broccoli:
   The jury will remain out for some time on President George
Bush's war against drugs, but Bush has quickly earned a clear
victory in The Great Broccoli Debate.
   No, the president hasn't swayed the nation to his side in hating
the bouquet-like vegetable. In fact, the broccoli consortium that
delivered five tons of the veggie to Washington claims that Bush's
stink about being fed broccoli every time he boards Air Force One
has actually made the veggie more popular in recent days.
   That was the first part of Bush's trilogy of victory. Another
part is that those five tons of broccoli is going to feed D.C.'s
hungry. The final part is the gem that this non-news story has
become. Polls show that Bush, beginning his second year in the Oval
Office, already is as popular as any president in U.S. history. His
lighthearted approach, with the able assistance of the equally
popular First Lady, only increase his approval among voters.
   Indeed, Bush has turned The Great Broccoli Debate into a public
relations coup.

   At least 177 other people have died in the past 10 days in

   Negotiators for El Salvador and the leftist rebels
opened U.N.-mediated peace talks today and signed a declaration
saying a truce in the nation's 10-year-old civil war is their
``initial objective.''
   The accord said the parties would try to end ``the armed
conflict through political means as speedily as possible.''
   The declaration also said the negotiators hoped to promote moves
toward democracy and respect for human rights in El Salvador and
toward integrating the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front into society.
   The document also was signed by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who held brief separate meetings with the two
sides today.
   Today's session, the first peace talks on El Salvador since
October, was the first time the United Nations has sponsored such
negotiations.
   The civil war has killed 72,000 people since 1980.
   The two sides also agreed on the format for future talks.
   They can either be face-to-face negotiations, mediated by Perez
de Cuellar or his personal representative, or involve U.N. envoy
bargaining separately with government and rebel delegations,
according to the accord.
   ``The simple fact of agreeing on the procedure for the
realization of the negotiating process is a considerable advance,''
Alvaro de Soto, Perez de Cuellar's special envoy, told reporters.
   Negotiators for El Salvador and the rebels shook hands before
signing the accord at today's public ceremony. De Soto later talked
with the two sides to discuss procedures for the negotiations, U.N.
officials said.
   The parties then adjourned. No date or location for the next
session of talks was announced. The teams were led by El Salvador's
justice minister, Oscar Santamaria, and rebel commander Shafik
Handal.
   De Soto has been working to resume a dialogue between the
government and the rebels since President Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador met with Perez de Cuellar in New York in February.
   Negotiations between the two sides were last held in October.
They were suspended after a union headquarters was bombed in
November and the rebels opened an offensive in San Salvador in
which more than 1,000 people died.
   The agreement to resume peace talks came at a time of rising
hopes for peace in Central America.
   Chances for ending the El Salvador conflict got a boost with the
defeat five weeks ago of the left-wing Sandinista government in
Nicaragua, which has channeled weapons from Cuba to the rebels,
according to U.S. officials.
   Cristiani's rightist government also has been hurt by falling
prices for coffee, a major export, and a drop in U.S. economic aid.
   Handal said the U.N.-sponsored dialogue must include issues such
as restructuring the army and police, judicial reforms and the
reform of El Salvador's electoral system.
   ``We are optimistic now because these negotiations are in the
framework of the United Nations,'' the rebel leader told a news
conference. ``This gives them a greater degree of seriousness and
weight than in the past.''
   The Salvadoran rebels, in an open letter to this week's summit
of Central American leaders in Nicaragua, proposed a plebiscite on
constitutional reform to reduce the size of the country's armed
forces.
   The proposed reform would also purge the military of right-wing
elements and subject it to civilian authority.
   The rebels urged that the plebiscite be held jointly with the
1991 elections for a new National Assembly in El Salvador. The
letter said the rebels were willing to become peaceful political
parties if an agreement was reached.

   Despite the collapse of communism
elsewhere in Europe, Greek Communists are hoping to share power in
an alliance with the socialists after elections Sunday.
   The most recent polls predict the Communist-led Coalition of the
Left and Progress will win 10.5 percent of the vote, down from 11
percent it scored in November elections.
   The conservative New Democracy party is expected to remain at 46
percent and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, at 40
percent.
   If the conservatives fail to win a majority in the 300-member
Parliament, the Communists may be able to share power again, as
they have for the last 10 months.
   They teamed up with the conservatives after inconclusive
elections in June, and then with the socialists in an all-party
government in November. Meanwhile, Communist regimes in Eastern
Europe were being toppled in popular revolutions.
   ``The Greek people will not judge us because of the myths that
existed in Eastern European countries,'' said Mimis Androulakis,
the Communist Party's key strategist and reformer. ``They have
judged us by our decades of struggle for democracy and progress in
Greece.''
   The Greek Communists were outlawed from 1947 to 1974, and
political scientist Mihalis Spourdalakis says this may have saved
them.
   ``In Greece, the Communist left has always been identified with
the struggle for civil rights, for parliamentary democracy. On the
other hand, we have had an authoritarian anti-Communist tradition.
Communism is therefore not identified with authoritarianism, but
rather with progress,'' he said.
   Menia Mendrinou, a long-time Communist Party organizer, said the
party's supporters may have ``been numbed by events in Eastern
Europe, but they won't vote for any other party. They still believe
that the party will protect their interests.''
   The Communists contend that their jettisoning of the hammer and
sickle emblem when they formed the Coalition in March 1989, and
their alliance with the conservatives in June, were precursors of
broader changes elsewhere.
   ``We knocked down the walls before they were knocked down in
Europe,'' Communist Party secretary-general Grigoris Farakos is
fond of saying.
   Opponents, however, believe that it is this ideological
disintegration that has damaged the Communists.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress was formed in March 1989,
comprising the Communist party, dissidents who had left the party,
and some former supporters of the socialists.
   ``The Coalition is going through a crisis of policy,'' said
Angelos Hagios, a prominent Communist Party member who broke away
after the party joined with the conservatives in June. ``These
contradictions _ working first with New Democracy, then with both,
then with PASOK _ show a lack of independent leftist policy.''
   Even Androulakis, who is hoping to retain his Parliamentary seat
in the port city of Piraeus, acknowledges the party has a fight
ahead of it. He points out that a slight drop in popularity could
cost the Coalition some of the 21 seats it has in Parliament, and
its strength as a power broker.
   Hagios, a candidate for the newly formed leftist Popular
Opposition, believes his party may win a seat in Parliament at the
Coalition's expense.
   Pollster Panayote Dimitras expects the Communists may be further
damaged by a burgeoning environmentalist movement. The
environmentalists may improve on the one seat they won in November
_ attracting voters who blame the three major parties for the
10-month political stalemate.
   ``If they win a second or third seat, everything changes. They
become the key to power,'' Dimitras said.
   A recent decision by the Coalition to field joint candidates
with the socialists in five constituencies has led to heated
protests from some supporters. The move may block a New Democracy
majority in Parliament by denying it of two of the three seats it
holds in these areas.
   Opponents of the joint candidacies say it is incomprehensible
that the Communists cooperate with socialists. The
conservative-Communist coalition indicted former Premier Andreas
Papandreou and members of his eight-year socialist administration
on corruption charges last year.
   The Communists counter that a New Democracy government would
change the electoral law in favor of larger parties, closing the
door on further coalition governments. They also say it would adopt
strict austerity measures in a bid to revive the economy.
   Analysts, however, point out that the Communists are already in
danger of losing their reason to exist. They have recently accepted
Greece's role in the European Community, after seeing the former
Communist states of Eastern Europe seek ties with the EC.
   ``People will soon be voting Communist only for sentimental
reasons,'' said Spourdalakis.

   They may not chomp on pizza and fight teen-age
hoods, but they do live in New York City's sewers. Dank-dwelling
snapping turtles have been pulled out from sewage treatment plants.
   Their diets sometimes consist of cold cuts.
   Some of the turtles recovered from the Bronx and Manhattan
plants have weighed 50 pounds or more, according to Tina Casey, a
spokeswoman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection.
   ``They're big enough to do serious damage to any hoodlum,'' she
said, but not quite the size of the characters of the new hit
movie, ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   The last time any of the big snappers came out of a New York
sewer was 1988, when two were found, lean, mean and on screens
intended to sift tree limbs and other large objects from sewage,
Casey said. Periodically, younger snapping turtles or other,
smaller breeds are found.
   Workers at the Bronx screening station have kept a few of the
greenish-brown reptiles around as pets, feeding them cold cuts and
meatballs, she said.
   When a ``monster'' turtle surfaces, the department has the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals take it
to upstate New York and set it free. But they have to be handled
carefully _ the turtle's powerful jaws can ``easily put a nasty
dent in your body,'' Casey said.
   Casey ran across the sewer turtles' existence two years ago
while researching the mythical blind albino alligators that don't
inhabit the city sewers after supposedly being flushed down
toilets. While the sewers are too cold and too sparse of alligator
food, they seem to be all right for freshwater turtles, she said.
   ``Alligators look tougher, but turtles really know how to
survive in New York,'' she said. ``They're real New Yorkers.''
   Two theories about how the turtles got into the sewer system get
the most credence at the department. One suggests they are
back-washed into outlet pipes from the Bronx River or maybe the
East River, Casey said. The other is that the turtles hatch in
ponds at the Bronx Zoo or Central Park Zoo and crawl out to find
their way into the sewer system.
   Besides turtles, eels, pythons and other creatures have shown up
in the city's sewage.
   Look for them if they make a sequel.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev phoned the
president of Estonia today and sharply criticized the Baltic
republic's drive for independence, Estonian media reported.
   Arnold Ruutel, president of Estonia's Supreme Soviet parliament,
told official television that Gorbachev used strong words and was
generally very angry during the conversation.
   In a later radio interview, Ruutel said Gorbachev criticized
Estonia's Supreme Soviet for declaring the republic an occupied
state.
   ``When I heard of your resolution I was completely beside
myself. You must declare the resolution null and void. It is an
invalid one,'' Ruutel quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``It seems to me that I have to introduce similar measures as
those taken in Lithuania,'' he quoted the Soviet leader as saying.
Ruutel did not elaborate on those remarks when asked by the radio
interviewer.
   Soviet soldiers and tanks moved into Lithuania after officials
in the republic refused to back down on their claim of
independence, but Moscow has repeatedly said it would not use force
there.
   Ruutel said that after he explained Estonia's position and that
it would not give up its desire for independence, the Soviet
president calmed down, the television report said without
elaboration.
   No further details were available from the reported phone
conversation.
   Estonia said last week it would seek to re-establish
independence at the end of a still-undefined transition period. But
unlike their Baltic neighbors in Lithuania, the Estonians are
taking a more careful line on secession and have called on Moscow
to start negotiations.
   The Estonian parliament's deputy speaker, Marju Lauristin, one
of the leaders of the People's Front political movement, said she
was pleased with the conversation despite its beginning.
   ``In spie of this first negative reaction, it is a contact and
every contact is needed for negotiations,'' she said.
   Lauristin said Gorbachev demanded from Ruutel a full report on
the situation in Estonia. She said the report was being prepared
and would be sent to the Soviet president as soon as possible.
   Gorbachev's call followed appeals from non-Estonian
nationalities to Moscow to protect the rights of Soviet citizens in
the republic.
   Estonia declared support for Lithuania's March 11 declaration of
independence and called on Gorbachev in a parliament resolution to
halt army pressure and stop ``political provocations'' against
Lithuania.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were
independent from the end of World War I until Soviet annexation in
1940.
   Meanwhile, Edgar Savisaar, elected the republic's premier on
Tuesday, said his government would focus on restoring independence,
economic reforms and attempts to avoid conflicts among Estonia's
ethnic groups.
   Ethnic Estonians make up only about 60 percent of the republic's
1.6 million people. Slavs and other non-Estonian nationalities have
voiced fears that the republic's move toward independence would
hurt their interests.
   ``The area where this will be solved is economic,'' Savisaar
said. ``With politics, we can't make them happy, we can't improve
it. ... But the Russians are also interested that the material side
of life begins to grow better.''
   Savisaar, the chairman of the People's Front, said following his
election he would cooperate with all ethnic groups. He said a list
of Cabinet members would be presented next week.
   His statements today appeared to confirm reports from sources
who said the new government was unlikely to include any of the 27
legislators representing the interests of the non-Estonian
population in the 105-member parliament.
   In another development, a bomb damaged a Soviet T-34 tank put up
as a monument to Soviet soldiers who died in World War II near the
Estonian city of Valga, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Hours after the bomb attack Tuesday night, about 20 youths armed
with clubs pushed away a soldier guarding the damaged tank, tore
off a tarpaulin covering it and left. Police officers standing
nearby did not intervene, Tass said.

   Singer Gloria Estefan, who suffered a broken
back in a tour bus accident, was released from a hospital
Wednesday, saying she was thankful to be alive.
   The vocalist of Miami Sound Machine headed home to Miami. Her
release came two weeks after she underwent spinal surgery.
   ``I promise I will work 100 percent to come back,'' she told
reporters at the Orthopedic Institute for Joint Diseases.
   Estefan, 32, suffered broken vertebrae March 21 when her tour
bus was struck by a tractor-trailer on an icy Pennsylvania highway.
She was transferred to the New York hospital the next day, and
doctors performed delicate surgery to implant two steel rods in her
spine.
   But just two weeks after that trauma, she ended her news
conference by getting out of a wheelchair and standing without help.
   Estefan thanked the hospital staff for their support and had
warm praise for the private nurses who ``helped me learn to sit and
walk again.''
   She praised her doctors, who ``gave me a couple of spare parts
to go home with'' and joked that her surgeon, Dr. Michael Neuwirth,
assured her: ``I wouldn't beep when I go through airport security.''
   All in all, Estefan said, she was ``thankful for the miracle of
being alive.''
   Neuwirth said the singer faces about six months of
rehabilitation but added: ``We fully expect her to return and
perform again.''
   Estefan, who was nominated for a Grammy award this year, said
she planned to spend the time exercising, reading, sleeping and
eating. ``It's the first time in my life I'll actually have to put
on pounds,'' she joked, and added: ``Hopefully, in a few months,
I'll be back good as new.''
   Estefan and her husband, Emilio, returned to Florida on a
private jet provided by entertainer Julio Iglesias.

   West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich-Genscher met with President Bush today and predicted that
1991 will be the year Germany is reunited.
   Genscher conferred with Bush in the Oval Office on the recent
East German election results, on Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze's talks with U.S. officials, the Lithuanian crisis and
other matters.
   The West German minister told reporters afterwards, ``We had
very friendly talks and we agreed in all important questions.''
   Genscher said East Germany's new, non-communist government
probably will be formed by next week. ``We want to begin
discussions with the new government ... on economic, monetary and
social union between the two German states'' so living conditions
can be improved in the former communist state.
   He said sub-cabinet diplomats from the two-plus-four powers will
soon hold another meeting on the external aspects of German
unification, and ``we hope that by the end of April the first
meeting at ministerial level'' will be held.
   The participants in the negotiations include both German nations
plus the four nations that emerged victorious after World War II:
the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   Asked when unification will occur, Genscher replied, ``I assume
that the first all-German elections will take place in the year
1991 and that is also the year in which German unity will be
achieved.''
   He said Germany is sworn never to develop nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons, and offered anew the assurance that ``There is
nobody, no single person in Germany that would question the present
Polish western border. This is something that is definite.''
   ``We want to see German unification be a contribution to
stability in Europe,'' said Genscher, who added that NATO
membership for the new nation remains ``of great importance.'' The
Soviet Union wants a united Germany to be neutral, not in NATO.
   Shevardnadze was opening three days of talks with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III later today. The Soviet minister meets
with Bush on Friday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Genscher
primarily discussed upcoming sessions of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the 35-nation talks that involve
nearly all the countries in Europe, the United States and Canada.
   ``The foreign minister and the president agreed this is a good
forum for providing a framework for stability as we go through the
changes in Eastern Europe,'' said Fitzwater. He emphasized that the
European conference ``will not replace (NATO) in any way.''
   No date has yet been set for the Bush-Gorbachev summit,
tentatively set for mid-June. ``We're hopeful to be able to have a
date'' by Friday when Baker and Shevardnadze finish their talks,
Fitzwater said.
   Bush was hearing later today from Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu's emissaries on how Japan plans to open its markets
to U.S. exports.
   The president also was presenting a crystal apple to the
national teacher of the year. Inclement weather forced the White
House to cancel plans for Bush to play tennis with several pros.
   Bush, flying between political speeches in Indianapolis and the
Detroit area on Tuesday, expressed concern about Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's threat to destroy ``half of Israel'' with chemical
weapons if the Israelis attack facilities in Iraq.
   ``This is no time to be escalating tensions in the Middle
East,'' said Bush. He urged Hussein to ``forget about talk of using
chemical and biological weapons.''
   Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor before it was completed
in 1981. Two Iraqis and three others were arrested in London last
week on U.S. charges of trying to ship nuclear triggers to Baghdad.
   Bush said he has seen ``no evidence'' that Iraq now has the
newest generation of binary, or two-stage, chemical weapons.
   The president was savoring two congressional victories Tuesday:
a House vote for $720 million in aid to Panama and Nicaragua and
Senate passage of the first new clean air standards in 13 years.
But the senators were not expected to heed his plea to pass the
Panama-Nicaragua package before leaving town Thursday for a 12-day
Easter recess.
   Bush dismissed Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell's
complaint about the administration's ``jigsaw puzzle'' approach to
foreign aid.
   ``There's no jigsaw puzzle,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air
Force One. ``These are laser-like, urgent requests.''

   Cambodian troops bombarded a
strategic guerrilla-held town in the northwest Wednesday after
retaking another town, the guerrillas and Western sources said.
   Government forces took the district capital of Thmar Puok on
Tuesday with heavy rocket, tank and infantry assaults, said Ok
Serei Sopheak, a spokesman for the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   The Front, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the
Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government, had held the town.
   The government forces struck from positions to the south retaken
in recent weeks, another Front official said.
   Other guerrillas said the town fell Wednesday.
   There was no way to explain the discrepancy or verify the
reports.
   Guerrilla and Western sources also said government forces on
Wednesday were shelling Banteay Chmar, a district capital near
Thmar Puok. They said it was expected to fall soon.
   If Banteay Chmar falls, the government will have retaken every
major position the guerrillas seized after Vietnam announced last
September it had pulled all its troops from Cambodia.
   Both towns are in Banteay Meanchey province and close to the
Thai border.
   Guerrilla sources also reported a heavy government attack on the
Front's military headquarters at Boueng Trakuan, across the border
from the Thai town of Ta Phraya.
   Some of the rounds strayed into Thailand. Western relief workers
in Ta Phraya said the shelling on the other side of the border was
so heavy that houses shook.
   As many as 5,000 refugees fleeing the fighting have gone to the
giant Site 2 refugee camp, about 60 miles north of Aranyaprathet,
Western relief officials said.
   Western diplomats cited reports that thousands more civilians
had fled Thmar Puok to remaining guerrilla-held areas inside
Cambodia, which the guerrillas call ``liberated zones.''
   The non-Communist Front is allied with two other guerrilla
groups _ forces of former monarch Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the
Communist Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia by terror and
famine until Vietnam's invasion ousted it from Phnom Penh more than
a decade ago.
   Western relief workers said there were reports of heavy
government attacks in the past few weeks on Khmer Rouge positions
opposite the Thai town of Trat on the southern border with
Cambodia. No details were immediately available.
   The guerrillas have blamed the recent reversals on an
interruption in arms shipments from China, their main supplier, and
on what they claim is the reintroduction of thousands of Vietnamese
soldiers in Cambodia.

   Ivan Boesky _ the biggest fish netted so far in
the Wall Street scandal _ completed his federal prison term today
when he was officially released from a halfway house.
   Boesky signed papers for his release and left the Brooklyn House
Community Corrections Center at 5:05 a.m., said Richard Luna, a
U.S. Bureau of Prisons official in New York.
   Boesky, 53, was transferred to the halfway house Dec. 6 from a
minimum security federal prison in Lompoc, Calif. The former stock
speculator lived outside the center, reported in twice a week and
called in daily starting Feb. 5, Luna said.
   Boesky now must to report to a probation officer once a month
for six months, officials said.
   Boesky's lawyer, Robert McCaw, would not comment on where Boesky
has been living or what his plans are. When he was allowed to live
outside the halfway house, Boesky was required to have a paying
job, although officials declined to say what that was.
   In 1986, Boesky moved to settle insider-trading charges by
paying $100 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
agreeing to plead guilty to lying to federal regulators.
   He was sentenced to three years in prison, beginning his term in
April 1988. He was released early for good behavior.
   Boesky is expected to testify against former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. junk bond financier Michael Milken, whose trial may
not begin unitil 1991.
   Boesky also is expected to testify at the trial of former
arbitrager John A. Mulheren on securities fraud charges. Mulheren,
a former business associate of Boesky, was arrested for weapons
possession and allegedly told police he planned to kill Boesky.
   Asked about Boesky's plans, a source close to Boesky said he is
``playing a very low profile and readjusting, staying away from the
cameras and reporters.''
   The source said Boesky would not give any interviews until he
has finished his role as a government witness, if then.
   As part of his plea, Boesky agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
in the continuing Wall Street crackdown and offered information
that led to Drexel's record $650 million settlement of criminal and
civil securities charges and the indictment of Milken a year ago.
Drexel is liquidating now after its parent filed for bankruptcy
protection in February.
   Boesky caused a stir in November when he was photographed by a
New York tabloid in Stamford, Conn., with shoulder-length gray hair
and a long, scraggly beard. He was spotted a month later in a
business suit in New York City, his hair and beard neatly trimmed.
   Boesky reportedly is living in the New York area. He owns a
75-acre estate in Westchester County north of New York City, which
recently has been under renovation.

   Michael Jackson telephoned, Elton John flew
into town and thousands of other who have never even met Ryan White
offered prayers and get-well wishes for the teen-age AIDS victim
clinging to life today.
   President Bush, who was in Indianapolis for a political
fund-raiser Tuesday, planted a tree for White at a ceremony 1{
miles from the hospital where the 18-year-old lay in critical
condition on life-support equipment.
   ``He's been fighting a courageous battle against a deadly
disease and also against ignorance and fear. Ryan has helped us
understand the truth about AIDS and he's shown all of us the
strength and bravery of the human heart,'' Bush said.
   Dr. Martin B. Kleiman said White was heavily sedated so a
life-support system helping him breathe would function more
efficiently.
   ``He's holding on. His status deteriorated in the first day or
two and then reached a plateau. Any patient who is critical must
stabilize before he can recover and Ryan has stabilized,'' Kleiman
said today.
   ``There have been patients who have been this ill and have
recovered. We can maintain patients at this level for prolonged
periods of time.''
   White is on life support because AIDS left him susceptible to a
respiratory infection.
   ``The majority of his difficulties derived from the inability of
his lungs to support him,'' Kleiman said.
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from contaminated blood
products, has waged a five-year battle with the disease during
which he grew from an object of scorn in his hometown of Kokomo
into an international spokesman for AIDS patients. He fought a
successful court battle to attend school and helped reinforce the
message that AIDS cannot be spread through casual contact.
   Calls Tuesday from of well-wishers and celebrities with messages
of love and prayers swamped Riley Hospital for Children, where
White he was admitted Thursday with an AIDS-related lung ailment.
   When Jackson called, a speaker phone was brought to White's
bedside in hopes the unconscious teen-ager would hear Jackson's
words.
   ``He told Ryan he loved him and that God is with him,'' family
spokewoman Carrie Van Dyke said. ``And he said, `Hang in there,
buddy, and get better.'''
   Jackson befriended White a couple of years ago and gave him a
car. White also was a guest at Jackson's California ranch during
New Year's.
   John flew in from Los Angeles to spend five hours Monday with
the family. He ``just raised their spirits tremendously, that
someone of his stature would care so much to drop everything,'' Van
Dyke said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Mary Maxwell said the flood of calls ``has
been bedlam. We're getting calls from every small town in the
United States. It hasn't let up.''
   ``We handled 4,500 calls yesterday and we'll probably get 5,000
today,'' said Walt Linne, who oversees the switchboard. Callers
conveyed ``good wishes, concern, prayers and love.''
   Among those who left messages were actor Tony Danza, quarterback
Joe Montana and country singers Johnny Cash and the Statler
Brothers.
   White's mother, Jeanne, said it was her son's decision to be
placed on the life-support system.
   ``The decision came entirely from Ryan. If Ryan had a chance,
then Ryan wanted to go for it,'' Mrs. White said. ``All we can do
is hope for the best.''
   Mrs. White and her daughter, Andrea, 16, have remained at
White's bedside since he was hospitalized Thursday. His father,
Wayne White, who is divorced from Mrs. White, visited his son
Monday.

   The Navy secretary and chief of the service's
operations on Wednesday discounted a recent proposal by former Navy
Secretary John Lehman that called for greater reliance on reserve
forces as a cost-saving move.
   ``I won't begin by saying `nonsense' but a lot of it is,'' Adm.

critical materials gave Trost an account of Lehman's testimony.
   Lehman, who during his tenure in the Reagan administration
presided over one of the largest naval buildups, told the Armed
Services panel last week that the Navy should use more reserves and
reduce tours of duty for active forces.
   The former Navy secretary proposed manys ships and planes manned
``50 percent by active and 50 percent by weekend warriors.''
   But in the first public response by the Navy's top brass, Trost
said the service has had ``difficulty attracting people of the
necessary skills and the necessary numbers'' to the reserves.
   ``The result has been that we man our naval reserve ships with a
higher number of active duty personnel than we would like,'' he
said.
   Trost, who serves as the chief of naval operations, said that
during the first nine months of his current assignment, he did not
recall Lehman making those points offered in his recent testimony.
   ``Perhaps I'm missing something,'' he said.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III, who also disagreed with
Lehman's statements, said that savings realized from relying on the
reserves would be no greater than 10 perent or 15 percent.
   ``Expansion of naval reserve should be limited to areas where
its cost effective, mutual support can be provided to the active
force because this Navy needs to provide for this nation's
deterrence,'' Garrett said.
   The Navy secretary said in fiscal 1990, 26 ships will be moved
to the reserves. The fiscal 1991 defense budget calls for putting
40 ships in reserve, he said.
   Questioned about the possibility of a 450-ship Navy, Garrett
said he would fight any effort in the Bush administration to reduce
the force.
   ``We will continue to argue our case with Congress and the
(defense) secretary,'' he said. ``There are no plans in the
five-year plan to go to a 450-ship Navy.''

   The state must give welfare recipients
enough money to afford housing, New York's highest court ruled in a
decision hailed as a victory for the homeless.
   ``A schedule establishing assistance levels so low that it
forces large numbers of families with dependent children into
homelessness does not meet the statutory standard,'' the Court of
Appeals declared Tuesday.
   The court ordered a trial to determine whether New York state's
welfare shelter allowance is inadequate. Welfare advocates had
argued the shelter allowance was set far below market rates for
even the cheapest housing.
   The case was brought by Barbara Jiggetts, a New York City woman
who complained her shelter allowance forced her to choose between
housing and food for her children.
   State Social Services Commissioner Cesar Perales, in a
statement, said the ruling established a requirement for a
reasonable housing allowance but did not conclude the state's
welfare grants were inadequate.
   ``The New York state Department of Social Services is preparing
for a trial on that issue,'' Perales said.
   But lawyers for Jiggetts said they believed the Court of
Appeals' strong language would make it hard for a lower court not
to order increased welfare rates.
   ``It's a great decision and it's very important for the welfare
population of New York,'' said Allan Gropper of the state Bar
Association's Project for the Homeless of the City. He said studies
have shown as many as one-third of the homeless people in New York
City had been evicted.
   Courts in Massachusetts and other states have made similar
rulings recently, poverty law experts said.
   Jiggetts, a single mother of three, sued New York City social
service officials in 1987 when she was being evicted from her
apartment. She's since found housing, but other families joined the
lawsuit and the state became the defendant, said Matthew Diller, a
lawyer for the New York Legal Aid Society.
   New York state has more than 450,000 welfare recipients,
two-thirds in New York City.
   Christopher Lamb, another Legal Aid Society lawyer, said the
shelter allowance for a family of four in New York City is $312 a
month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development reports the
average market rate for a two-bedroom apartment for poor people in
New York City is $566.
   ``People shouldn't be sent out into the New York City market and
be told you have to find an apartment for a family of four at $312
a month,'' Lamb said. ``It's like hitting your head against the
wall.''
   Welfare advocates supporting the lawsuit contended that, in
1987, more than 60 percent of Aid to Families with Dependent
Children recipients living in private housing were forced to pay
rents higher than their shelter allowances.

<HEAD>Government Finally Gets Better Count of Secrets: 6.8 Million a
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seven years of trying, the government
thinks it finally has an accurate count of how many secrets it
creates: 6.8 million a year.
   That's a 35 percent decrease from the previous count, but nearly
all the drop came when the Navy decided it really didn't originate
more secrets than the rest of the government put together.
   It's still just an estimate but it appears that the ``top
secret,'' ``secret'' and ``confidential'' stamps were wielded
6,796,501 times in the fiscal year which ended last Sept. 30.
   ``It appears that this unprecedented drop is primarily the
result of more accurate counting, rather than an actual tremendous
decrease in classification activity,'' said Steven Garfinkel, who
has spent the past seven years trying to get the government to
produce fewer secrets and count them more accurately.
   Garfinkel heads the Information Security Oversight Office,
created in 1982 when then-President Reagan rewrote all the rules
for classifying documents.
   In his annual report to President Bush, released Tuesday,
Garfinkel praised the Navy for finally figuring out what he has
been trying to count each year.
   The government doesn't actually count its secrecy decisions each
year. It samples the number of times some offices decide to
classify information. Then it projects those numbers to reflect the
number of decisions in all offices.
   Moreover, there are two kinds of secrets: original secrets, of
which 500,000 were produced last year, and derivative secrets, of
which 6.3 million were created. For example, an official creates an
original secret by deciding that all photographs from a spy
satellite will be kept secret; another official creates a
derivative secret each time he stamps one of the photos ``top
secret.''
   A derivative secret also is created when one official copies
another official's original secret into a new document _ the
government equivalent of the friend who says, ``Don't tell
so-and-so, but I just learned that ....''
   For 1987 and 1988, the Navy reported creating far more original
secrets than the rest of the government combined. As Garfinkel put
it in his report to Bush, both the Defense Department and his
office ``expressed skepticism about the accuracy of these data.''
   In 1989, the Navy learned what went wrong. Some of its sample
offices were ``reporting the number of all classified documents on
hand, not just classification decisions that they had originated,''
Garfinkel said.
   Fixing that error knocked about 3.5 million off the number of
secrets created last year.
   Garfinkel said it didn't hurt that the Navy sampled seven times
more offices than before, conducted its samples for almost half a
year and provided all sample offices with ``extensive instructions
and training.''
   Of the four agencies _ the Defense, State and Justice
departments and the CIA _ that create nearly 99 percent of the
secrets, only Justice created more secrets in 1989 than 1988. Not
only that, Justice reported significant increases in the number of
overclassified and mismarked documents.
   But Garfinkel said that was far from a failure at Justice.
   He said the number of secrets rose because more FBI agents are
assigned to catch spies and FBI field offices are keeping better
records. The bureau creates more than 90 percent of Justice's
secrets.
   In addition, Garfinkel praised the FBI for starting to review
actual documents as well as surveying agents, which he said is how
the bureau found the misclassified items. ``That's a commendable
effort to achieve better quality control,'' he said.
   Overall in 1989, Garfinkel said, ``the strides were modest, but
what's most important is we finally have the Defense Department
count in the ball park. These numbers can provide a benchmark to
look at future activity.''

   NASA said Wednesday testing of the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope is taking longer than expected,
but that should not delay next week's launch aboard space shuttle
Discovery.
   The space agency had said testing of the telescope would have to
be completed by midnight Wednesday for Discovery to lift off as
planned Tuesday. That deadline was extended to Thursday morning.
   ``Tests are going fine. There are no problems. But it's going
slower than we expected,'' said George Diller, a spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   A 52-hour check of the telescope's scientific instruments was
interrupted Monday by a power outage that knocked out air
conditioning and forced the shutdown of heat-sensitive computers.
Testing resumed Tuesday evening after technicians switched over to
a newer backup power system capable of withstanding an electric
failure.
   To accommodate the extra testing time, NASA has rearranged
launch preparations, moving up certain things that normally would
not have been done until later, Diller said.
   Charging of the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries,
temporarily interrupted by the power outage, also continued
Wednesday. The batteries will be charged until two days before
launch, when the shuttle's payload bay doors are closed.
   Technicians planned to close out the shuttle's rear engine
compartment this week. That involves making final inspections,
removing protective covers for flight, installing last-minute items
and cleaning the area.
   No extra time to solve problems is left, and any further
complications will delay the mission, Diller said. NASA on Saturday
moved the launch from April 12 to April 10 because preparations
were ahead of schedule.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:47 a.m. Tuesday with
five astronauts who will put the telescope into orbit on the second
day of the five-day mission.
   Once deployed, the Hubble will orbit 380 miles above Earth for
15 years, free of atmospheric distortion. It will be capable of
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant
that their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.

   El Salvador's government and leftist rebels met
for U.N.-mediated peace talks Wednesday in a new effort to end
their civil war, but disagreement quickly surfaced on the issue of
a cease-fire.
   Both sides and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
agreed to seek a truce as an ``initial objective'' on the way to a
negotiated settlement. But Shafik Handal, chief delegate of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas, made plain
his group links acceptance of a cease-fire to progress on political
reforms.
   The rightist, U.S.-backed government of President Alfredo
Cristiani says suspension of fighting must have priority.
   The two sides signed a U.N.-sponsored declaration committing
them to seek a cease-fire and a definitive end to ``the armed
conflict through political means as speedily as possible.''
   The accord called for promoting moves toward democracy and
respect for human rights in El Salvador, and reintegrating the FMLN
fighters into the nation's shattered society.
   The talks then recessed until May. No date or location was
announced for the next round.
   El Salvador's civil war has killed some 72,000 people since it
began in 1980.
   The rebels have come under pressure since the defeat of the
left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua's Feb. 25 election.
   Nicaragua helped the FMLN for more than a decade. U.S. officials
say Nicaragua also was a transit point for Cuban weapons shipments
to the Salvadoran guerrillas.
   During a rebel offensive in November, a Soviet appeal for ending
the bloodshed contrasted sharply with unflagging support for the
guerrillas by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   On Wednesday, FMLN representatives and Salvadoran government
representatives led by Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria shook
hands before signing the accord.
   The sides held brief separate talks with Perez de Cuellar at the
U.N. building in Geneva and met with Alvaro de Soto, the U.N.
special envoy for Central America, to discuss procedure.
   Both sides agreed that future talks can either be face-to-face
or involve shuttle diplomacy by the United Nations between the two
delegations.
   ``The simple fact of agreeing on the procedure for the
realization of the negotiating process is a considerable advance,''
de Soto told reporters.
   Peace talks were last held in October. They were suspended after
a union headquarters was bombed in November and the rebels launched
their offensive in San Salvador. More than 1,000 people died in the
fighting.
   De Soto has been working to resume a dialogue between the
government and the rebels since Cristiani met Perez de Cuellar in
New York in February.
   Handal said the new talks must include issues such as
restructuring of the army and police, judicial reform and reform of
El Salvador's electoral system.
   ``We are optimistic now because these negotiations are in the
framework of the United Nations,'' the FMLN official told a news
conference. ``This gives them a greater degree of seriousness and
weight than in the past.''
   The Salvadoran rebels, in an open letter to this week's summit
of Central American leaders in Nicaragua, proposed a plebiscite on
constitutional reform to reduce the size of the country's armed
forces. The proposed reform would also purge the military of
right-wing elements and subject it to civilian authority.
   The rebels urged that the plebiscite be held jointly with the
1991 elections for a new National Assembly in El Salvador. The
letter said the rebels were willing to become peaceful political
parties if an agreement were reached.

   Exiled King Michael of Romania plans his first
visit to his homeland since a Soviet-installed government forced
him to abdicate 42 years ago, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   Michael plans to leave April 12 for what spokeswoman Danielle
Maillefer termed a ``sort of private pilgrimage'' of no more than
10 days, accompanied by his wife, Queen Anne.
   The provisional Romanian government was informed of the private
visit ``through diplomatic channels,'' Ms. Maillefer said.
   Michael left Romania four days after his Dec. 30, 1947,
abdication. He said he signed the document because he was
threatened his supporters would be massacred, if he refused.
   At a news conference shortly after the overthrow of Nicolae
Ceausescu in December, the 68-year-old Michael said he would head a
constitutional monarchy, if asked to by voters through a national
referendum. ``If people want me to come back, I will come back,''
he said.
   Michael is related to the British and other European royalty and
holds a British passport. He settled in Switzerland in 1956.

   A court has ordered actor Yves Montand to submit to
a blood test to determine if he is the father of a 14-year-old girl
whose mother has filed a paternity lawsuit.
   The court concluded Tuesday that Montand and former actress Anne
Florange had a relationship for several years after they met in
1972 while making films in southern France.
   Montand, 68, could refuse the test, but would ``bear all
consequences of this refusal,'' said the court. There was no
immediate indication how the actor would respond.
   Ms. Florange asked that Montand pay $170,000 in damages and
interest to cover the costs of raising the girl, Aurora.
   Press reports said Ms. Florange sued only after she became
convinced that new scientific techniques could establish beyond
doubt whether Montand was Aurora's father.
   Montand, known to American audiences for the films ``Let's Make
Love'' and ``Z,'' had no children from his 33-year marriage to
actress Simone Signoret, who died in 1985. But on Dec. 31, 1988, at
age 67, he became a father when his girlfriend, Carole Amiel, gave

   Actor Burt Reynolds testified in a lawsuit
brought by the family of a veteran stuntman who was killed when his
motorcycle plunged down a 40-foot embankment while filming a movie
in the Arizona desert.
   Reynolds, a former stuntman himself, told a jury Tuesday that
remote filming locations should have helicopters or some other form
of transportation available.
   A film made by Reynolds, ``Hooper,'' included a character based
on stuntman Dar Robinson, who was 39 years old when he died of
massive internal injuries in the 1986 accident.
   ``His reputation was that he was the best in the business,
especially for high falls,'' said Reynolds.
   Robinson died while filming a high-speed motorcycle chase for
``Million Dollar Mystery.''
   The multimillion dollar wrongful death lawsuit filed against
Dino De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Productions Ltd. alleges
that Robinson died because an ambulance was not available. It took
two hours to get him to the nearest hospital.
   Defense attorneys maintain there was no ambulance on the set
because Robinson felt it was ``bad luck'' and felt it was an insult
to his stunt abilities.
   Reynolds, 54, testified in Superior Court that an ambulance was
present on the set of ``Stick,'' a film in which Robinson performed
a fall from a 16-story building without a protective airbag or net.
   ``It is my understanding that if you are doing a major stunt,
there should be an ambulance present,'' said Reynolds, who also
directed the film.

   Four years ago, a new test that seemed to detect
all forms of cancer from tiny blood samples appeared destined to
revolutionize the way doctors screen people for the disease.
   Now, many specialists doubt the method will ever live up to its
promise. For reasons they cannot explain, the test seems to work
only in the hands of the physician who invented it.
   In 1986, Dr. Eric T. Fossel of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital
said he had found a way to tell whether a patient had cancer simply
by examining a bit of his blood in a nuclear magnetic resonance
scanner, or NMR. It would detect tumors too small to feel, or spot
on X-rays.
   Fossel continued to work on the method and reported more
encouraging results as he tested thousands of blood samples. The
discovery was so important that many other doctors hurried to try
it out. Apparently without reported exception, they failed.
   Two studies published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine _ the journal that first described Fossel's apparent
breakthrough _ add to the mounting evidence against it.
   ``We were unable to determine whether or not a person had cancer
based on the blood test,'' said Dr. Paul Okunieff of Massachusetts
General Hospital.
   Carefully mirroring Fossel's methods, Okunieff tested blood from
79 people with cancer or pre-cancerous diseases and 66 people in
the hospital for other reasons. The test could not tell them apart.
   Terje Engan directed a Norwegian group from the University of
Trondheim that conducted a similar comparison of blood from 104
cancer patients and 164 healthy people. When the people studied
were the same sex and age, the test could not distinguish those
with cancer from those without.
   In his report, Okunieff reviewed 18 studies, including his own,
that have used NMR to diagnose cancer. Only six _ all by Fossel _
worked.
   In one those studies, published last year, doctors from the West
German Cancer Center in Essen sent blood samples to Fossel from 54
men with testicular cancer, 88 men who had been successfully
treated for the disease and 57 healthy men the same age.
   Fossel, who had no information about the patients' status,
conducted the NMR tests and sent back the results. The German
doctors found that Fossel's findings were 90 percent accurate.
   So the question remains: How can a test work for one person but
nobody else?
   ``I honestly don't know what went wrong, but there is this big
difference between what he's getting and what other people
reported,'' commented Dr. Robert Shulman of Yale University School
of Medicine.
   Fossel refused to discuss the latest reports, but issued a
statement implying that others have not duplicated his results
because they failed to faithfully follow his methods.
   ``Clearly, the NMR cancer blood test requires close adherence to
the specified techniques,'' he wrote, ``but when carried out
correctly, this method is a candidate system for detection of
cancer as well as for monitoring cancer therapy.''
   The controversy is reminiscent of the debate over cold fusion.
After a University of Utah team announced the spectacular discovery
of nuclear fusion in a lab jar a year ago, other scientists have
had trouble duplicating their findings. The Utah group responded by
saying that the others had failed to precisely follow their
techniques.
   At the National Cancer Institute, which has financed some of
Fossel's research, Dr. Roger Aamodt said he is ``reasonably sure''
that the test will not be suitable for general cancer screening.
However, he said it might still be of some benefit in checking the
progress of treatment or recurrence in some individual cancer
patients.
   Aamodt said no one knows why the test seems to work only for
Fossel. While it's possible that the reasons have something to do
with differences in techniques or the patient populations studied,
the explanations are ``essentially all supposition and
speculation.''
   Aamodt and Okunieff said they thought Fossel had honestly tried
to obtain accurate results.
   ``We are still in a position where it is up in the air,'' said
Aamodt. ``This has been a controversial area since the first
finding. A lot of people looked at this and said it didn't make
sense. All along there have been questions. What you are seeing is
science in action.''

   A Boston-bound Eastern Airlines flight
made an emergency landing at National Airport today after the rear
stairway of the Boeing 727 popped open, an airport official said.
No injuries were reported.
   Eastern Flight 192 radioed to the tower shortly after takeoff
that a cockpit indictor showed the back stairway to be open, said
airport spokesman David Hess.
   The pilot received clearance for an emergency landing and landed
without incident, Hess said. No injuries were reported. The flight
had 70 passengers and a crew of seven, Hess said.
   The pilot's call to the tower was received at 1:55 p.m. EDT,
moments after takeoff, and after circling, the plane landed at 2:08
p.m., Hess said.
   The Boeing 727 model has a rear stairway under the tail of the
plane.
   ``It dropped some but I don't have a report yet on how far
down,'' Hess said.

<HEAD>Weather Satellites Now Three Decades Old</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When that first fuzzy satellite picture of the
earth arrived just over 30 years ago weather experts were overjoyed.
   Now, ``there was no way that any storm, anywhere in the world,
would go undetected,'' John W. Townsend Jr., director of NASA's
Goddard Space Center, recalled on Wednesday.
   And none has, though people sometimes ignore the warnings that
weather forecasters issue when storms are reported, he noted at a
news conference commemorating three decades of weather satellites.
   ``The 90s is turning out to be the decade of the climate. The
point to be made today is that we've been around for 30 years
measuring climate from space. We're not a `Johnny-come-lately,' ''
said Russell Koffler of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Satellites have ``revolutionized'' the science of weather
prediction, added J. E. Keigler, chief scientist for GE Astro
Space, which builds the Tiros weather satellites.
   He recalled meteorologists saying that the original machine
would be worthwhile if it produced just one picture.
   Tiros 1 went on to produce 22,000 pictures during its
three-month lifetime, which began April 1, 1960.
   ``And since then there's always been a Tiros in orbit,'' he
added, referring to the series of low-level weather satellites that
still circle the globe, measuring the climate and weather every
place on earth twice a day.
   The low-level satellites marking their 30th anniversary are
generically called Tiros, which is an abbreviation for Television
Infrared Observation Satellite.
   These days the public is more familiar with the GOES satellites
that hover in place over the equator, looking down at the whole
Earth from 22,300 miles in space.
   But still a pair of Tiros satellites zoom around the globe at a
mere 700 or so miles, getting a close look. So far 32 of these
satellites have been built and launched, with an average lifepsan
of 2{ years.
   And, while the first satellites were limited to pictures of what
is visible _ land, water and clouds _ now they measure much more.
   Air and sea-surface temperatures are taken, snow and ice cover
is tracked, ozone is measured, cloud cover measured, water vapor in
the air recorded and the radiation arriving from the sun and
departing from the Earth is tracked by these satellites, explained
Koffler.
   Even the amount of vegetation on the land is measured from the
satellites, he added, noting that this information is expected to
be especially useful in assessing the response to any global
changes in climate.
   The satellites are operated by NOAA's National Environmental
Satellite Data and Information Service and are known by the
designation NOAA when in service. A new NOAA satellite is scheduled
for launch in the fall.

   Alabama's youngest elected official,
21-year-old Merle Flowers, is hoping his 18-month stint as a city
councilman will help him win the vice presidency of Auburn
University's Student Government Association.
   Flowers has served for two years as a student senator and as
chairman of the association's budget and finance committee. He was
elected a councilman in his hometown of Section at age 19 in
October 1988.
   The 21,700-student university votes Thursday to elect student
government officers, and Flowers faces three opponents for the vice
presidency.
   Flowers said he wants to come across as ``low-profile but
energetic,'' but not ``like a politician'' despite his familiarity
with the electoral process.
   He said he was motivated to enter politics by a desire for
change in his hometown of 1,500, and doesn't regard his youth as a
disadvantage.
   ``After I was elected, I was more of a novelty to my school
friends, who introduced me as `Mr. Councilman,''' he said. ``Now a
lot of younger citizens are involved in the city's projects. It's
really broken down the age barrier.''
   Flowers travels home twice a month for council meetings and
handles other business by telephone. He said he plans to study law
and favors a career in politics but, for now, ``I'm taking it one
election at a time.''

   The columnist replied, ``I wish the film companies would come
out with a brochure on photography etiquette and stick it in with

   A portrait of Harrison County's first and
only woman sheriff, the late Virgie Huggins, is back in place in
the Sheriff's Hall of Fame.
   The badge-toting widow, who temporarily took her husband's jobs
as sheriff and tax collector when he died in January 1933,
apparently had her picture removed soon after by a lawman who
thought she didn't belong in the gallery.
   But the current sheriff, Joe Price, brought her back to the
Gulfport courthouse Tuesday after the Huggins family offered him
the portrait.
   ``I feel she should be up there like anybody else who served the
duties of sheriff,'' Price said.
   Mrs. Huggins ran against six opponents for the job of sheriff in
March 1933 but lost by 500 votes to a former sheriff, a man.
   ``The truth is, a lot of people hungered for the job of
sheriff,'' said her son, Cleveland Huggins Jr., 73. ``It was a
pretty good job then with the potential of making a lot of money.''
   Price said ``she probably would have been elected if it had been
a different era. 1933 was a little early for a woman.''

<HEAD>Libyan Leader Says Hostages Should be Freed For Ramadan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said foreign
hostages and prisoners of conscience should be freed to mark the
holy Moslem month of Ramadan, the official Libyan news agency said
Wednesday.
   ``He has called to mind the hostages in the Middle East of
various nationalities and religions, in particular the French
hostage'' Jacqueline Valente, said JANA.
   Valente was captured on a yacht off Cyprus in 1987 by Abu
Nidal's Libyan-backed Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said the Libyan leader stressed Islamic
humanitarian values and called on Moslems to refrain from detaining
innocent people.
   Gadhafi appealed to ``rank and file Moslems the world over,''
said Jana, to release ``the hostages and prisoners of conscience on
the advent of the blessed month of Ramadan _ the month of love and
tolerence.''
   Ramadan began in late March and lasts through April. During the
Moslem holy month, Moslems fast from sunrise to sunset, and it is
customary for rulers of Islamic countries to pardon prisoners to
mark the holiday.
   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
welcomed Gadhafi's appeal.
   ``Sometimes you get support from strange quarters,'' he said.
``Any release of the hostages would be welcome, and anyone who
urges their release is saying the right thing.''
   There are 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon. Most are held
by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut
on March 16, 1985. Seven other Americans are among the captives.
   Gadhafi has previously called for the release of all hostages
and has said it is against the teachings of Islam to take innocent
people captive.
   Valente was was captured along with her two daughters and five
Belgians. The Abu Nidal group claimed they were Israeli spies. The
children were freed in December 1988, reportedly after Gadhafi
intervened, but it is not known where their mother is.

   Mourners beat up a motorist who
accidentally crashed his car into a funeral procession and attacked
a jail warden tying to rescue him, police said.
   About 100 mourners were making their way to a cemetery to bury
Larry Waller, 21, killed in the crossfire of a gun battle last
Wednesday, when a car plowed into the procession of cars at an
intersection.
   ``It was a simple traffic accident,'' said police spokesman
Wendell Creager. ``But the woman whose car was hit got out and
started verbally abusing the other driver. Then some of the
mourners gathered around and it got out of hand.''
   Adler Nagy, 19, sought refuge in a Pinellas County Sheriff's
Office van, which was in the procession taking one of Waller's
relatives, a prison inmate, to the funeral.
   Scores of mourners surrounded the van, and several people jumped
inside and pummeled Nagy and Corrections Officer Bernetta Blossom,
31, said sheriff's spokeswoman Marianne Pasha. Tuesday's fracas
remains under investigation but no charges have been filed.
   Nagy and Ms. Blossom were treated for minor injuries.

   Jones said he did not know what exercises the members of the

   An autopsy will be held at the University of Mississippi Medical
Center, Jones said. Prison officials were not aware that Hall had
any medical problems, he said.
   The Regimented Inmate Discipline Program, styled after military
boot camp training, is a separate program for first offenders.

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A molten flow from the Kilauea Volcano
surged beneath a house today, destroyed it within an hour and
threatened other residences in an 82-home subdivision.
   It was the first Kalapana Gardens home destroyed since lava
enter the subdivision Tuesday, and the first destroyed by molten
rock since a December 1986 flow wiped out dozens of homes in the
subdivison.
   Tenants of the rented house moved out Monday, said Ed Torrison,
whose home was 50 feet away, in the path of flow. The lava passed
within several feet of two homes Tuesday and moved on to threaten
two others besides the one engulfed at 6 a.m. today.
   Like his neighbors, Torrison moved belongings out of his home.
That done, he sat back to await the verdict of Pele, the Hawaiian
volcano goddess.
   ``Everybody's nervous, but nobody wants to admit it,'' said
resident Dennis Gregory. ``People don't freak out here. This is
Hawaii. Everybody is taking it slow and easy.''
   Residents cheered the thunderous explosions of methane from
inside the flow and the flames that flashed through trees as the
lava cut a swath through the dense foliage.
   Several people watched the approaching lava from the balcony of
the closest home, occasionally pitching beer bottles into the
molten rock and laughing at repeated jokes about declining property
values in the neighborhood.
   ``It's a party atmosphere,'' said Craig Heiser, a neighbor
helping to evacuate residents. ``You can't do anything about it, so
just enjoy it.''
   The authorities said residents of 57 homes had been evacuated
and the entire community was on alert, meaning an evacuation order
could be issued within 72 hours. In addition to the subdivision
homes, there are 43 other houses in the area.
   ``What's happening now is the worst-case scenario,'' said Hawaii
County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   The lava late Tuesday overran a rock wall into the backyard of a
home and filled the seven-foot gully in the yard. Its edge stopped
just four feet from the home before it stopped moving sideways and
moved down a gully.
   The flow moved 100 yards down the gully overnight to threaten
three more homes.
   Lava had come within 20 feet of one of those three homes by
early today. It surged forward, burned a backyard tool shed, then
stopped as it built up a crust. But it could liquefy and surge in
another direction.
   Another flow, to the east, was about a half-mile above the
subdivision. Kim said it appeared the flow would not threaten homes
for at least another day.
   Civil defense and Red Cross officials opened a shelter at a
community center 12 miles to the east.
   Other Kalapana residents brought their families to view the
destruction and creation.
   ``People who live here are emotionally prepared for it, but you
still hope it's not going to happen,'' said Donna Olson, whose home
was destroyed in the 1986 flow. She lives with her three children
in a rented house threatened by the flow.
   ``I feel very emotional about this, but I also know there's a
balance to Pele. I know everything here has been born from the
lava. It's a circle.''

   If deal-making really is art, then the bidding
for Bonwit Teller that ended in a deal today was the aesthetic
equivalent of finger painting.
   A bankruptcy court hearing Monday turned into a corporate casbah
as attorneys frantically arranged offers for the failed department
store chain _ not over the typical Wall Street power lunch, but
within earshot of a federal judge.
   Deals came together, fell apart and came together again. Bidders
changed sides. An 11th-hour proposal by a would-be savior failed. A
lawyer played auctioneer as two sides upped offers $1 million at a
pop.
   ``I need 250,000 from each of you and I need it now!'' Donald N.
David, a lawyer representing deal-master Donald Trump, implored
members of a group bidding on five of the 16 Bonwit department
stores.
   David got an icy stare from one participant, who refused to
raise his ante. A representative of Trump _ whose eponymous gold
Tower on Fifth Avenue houses Bonwit's flagship store _ and two
other groups contributed the difference. The deal lived.
   The Trump group's bid was accepted by the seller today, and the
bankruptcy court indicated it would approve the plan.
   Bankruptcy court is becoming a home away from home for American
big business in the 1990s as companies stumble under the weight of
junk bonds and other takeover-related and expansion-related
problems from the 1980s, the decade of debt.
   A new era of restructuring means more proceedings like the one
Monday in a steamy bankruptcy courtroom overlooking New York Harbor.
   Amid shouting, cajoling, the toot of the Staten Island Ferry and
pounding of a jackhammer six floors below, Bonwit's was carved up.
Lawyers constantly pleaded for another minute as they huddled to
cut a deal.
   The nearly 10-hour ordeal took place in open court, where judges
rarely tolerate more than one person speaking at a time, let alone
protests and open bidding.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' David said Tuesday.
``I think if it weren't for that informality they wouldn't have
raised anywhere near the amount of money they did for the estate.''
   L.J. Hooker Corp., Bonwit's Atlanta-based parent, held the
auction to raise the liquidation value of the upscale store chain
it bought three years ago. Hooker had received just one bid for
five stores before the auction.
   The take for Hooker creditors rose by millions.
   A first round of bidding included offers from a French retailer,
a Florida department store, a Buffalo chain, a Canadian investor
and a group that included Trump and the women's apparel store the
Limited.
   As the second round began, the Trump group booted the Limited
and embraced Pyramid Cos., a Syracuse-based shopping mall developer
and owner that made the five-store bid.
   When it became apparent the group needed to raise its $20.25
million offer or lose out, the haggling intensified. David hustled
about, seeking more money. He got it. In 20 minutes, the bid rose
by $1.5 million, collapsing once in the process.
   The court looked like Sotheby's when two bidders battled for a
Bonwit store in exclusive Palm Beach, Fla. Lawyers for Frances
Brewster Inc., a Florida retailer, and Ralph Hibbard, a Canadian
investor, called bids from opposite sides of the courtroom, raising
the price to $2.2 million from $1.6 million.
   ``Sounds like an auction,'' Bankruptcy Judge Tina Brozman said
to laughter.
   After the Hibbard group conceded, Hooker lawyer Sheldon Hirshon,
serving as impromptu auctioneer, said: ``Going once, going twice..
.''
   The final drama was provided by the day's hoped-for white knight.
   Hooker lawyers had wanted to preserve the chain. In the morning,
they had announced that a group led by Bonwit's former CEO William
Ruben was planning a bid for 13 stores. In the mid-afternoon, they
said the deal was off.
   Around 6:30 p.m., lawyers told the judge it was on again. Ruben
said his $36 million bid could make Bonwit ``viable again.'' All he
needed was one day to arrange financing.
   Furious, David said reopening the bidding would violate an
agreement and ``make a fool out of everybody here.'' Hooker
attorneys eventually acquiesced, fearing they could lose all bids
if the Ruben group collapsed.
   Attorney Alan Hyman said Hooker decided ``to resort to the heady
and cerebral theory that a bird in the hand was worth two in the
bush.'' David, an hour after pacing angrily and saying, ``It's
off,'' gave associates two thumbs up.

<HEAD>Thatcher Seeks To Blunt New Tax: A Gamble Rather Than A Climb-Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Recognizing it is in serious political trouble,
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has moved to blunt
the impact of its unpopular new local government tax.
   But even though the so-called poll tax has provoked protest and
a demonstration that turned into a riot Saturday, the government
shows no sign of backing down.
   Instead, Mrs. Thatcher is taking a gamble that she can make the
tax palatable by the mid-1992 deadline for the next election. And
that, even close aides acknowledge, is an uncertain prospect.
   ``That's the question, and I don't know the answer,'' said a
Thatcher aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is not easy
to be popular when you are taxing 17 million more people.''
   On Tuesday, Environment Secretary Chris Patten ordered 20
high-spending local authorities to impose lower taxes and cut their
budgets for the current fiscal year. He said the move would reduce
the bills of 4 million people by $50-$160 a year.
   The tax that took effect April 1 averages $592 a person a year,
about one-third higher than the government target. It must be paid
by most of the 38 million adult Britons. Previously, only some 12
million property owners paid local government taxes.
   But the immediate effect of Patten's ``capping'' of the
high-spenders was to exacerbate the controversy.
   The opposition Labor Party was angered that no authorities ruled
by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party were on the list.
   The targeted authorities claimed they would have to cut services
and accused the government of being vindictive. Some threatened to
fight the measure in court.
   Patten, who is in charge of the tax, is dropping hints of
further fine-tuning. But Mrs. Thatcher says she will not abandon
the community charge, as the tax is officially called.
   She introduced the reform believing a head tax was fairer than a
property tax because it would net everybody, not just homeowners.
   She also believed that once the bills came in, taxpayers would
blame them on Labor high-spenders.
   Instead, the blame is falling on her. And the Patten refinements
appear to consist largely of spending more central government money
to bring down the levels of the poll tax.
   That's precisely what Mrs. Thatcher did not want. It smacks of a
retreat and prevents her from cutting income tax and boosting
old-age pensions, health spending and other pre-election favorites.
   The furor over the tax is worsened by economic problems.
   A year ago the Tories were claiming to be whipping inflation and
turning the economy around. Now interest rates have hit 15 percent,
inflation is heading above 8 percent, and the Tories have fallen 20
points behind Labor.
   ``It is not possible to claim economic miracles one year and
then be forced to put interest rates up to historically high levels
the following year and retain a reputation for competence,'' said
John Cole, a political analyst for the British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``But what has made this doubly difficult is the prime
minister's own identification with the poll tax,'' he wrote in the
weekly Listener.
   Saturday's riot appeared to be the work of groups of extreme
leftists and anarchists. It shocked Britons and temporarily
distracted from the tax itself.
   But the issue shows no sign of dying. And in the end it comes
down to the personality of the 64-year-old grocer's daughter. She
won't be moved on an issue she believes is right, and the poll tax
is such an issue.
   ``She has never been popular, and her greatest strength is she
has never actually aspired to be popular,'' said the Thatcher aide.
``She has never wanted to be loved and that is the overriding
quality of a successful statesman.''

   Compromises have allowed Wyoming and Idaho to join the movement
toward national acceptance of a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and by Wednesday, 22 years after his death, only
three states were holdouts.
   ``I think it shows that we are making headway,'' Lloyd Davis,
executive director of the King Federal Holiday Commission, said
Tuesday.
   He expressed confidence that Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana
would not hold out much longer amid what he sees as dramatic
applications of King's non-violent philosophy as far away as the
Philippines, China, Poland and East Germany.
   ``What's happening around the world shows the universality of
King,'' Davis said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   King was assassinated April 4, 1968, at age 39, while leading a
non-violent movement for racial equality. In 1983, after
considerable debate, Congress created a holiday to honor King on
the third Monday in January, around his Jan. 15 birthday.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day, first celebrated nationally in 1986,
is an official state holiday in some form in most states _ Idaho is
about to become the 47th.
   Wyoming, which calls itself the Equality State because it was
the first to give women the vote, had legislators who supported a
holiday commemorating equal rights but didn't want it in King's
name. A compromise created Martin Luther King Jr. Wyoming Equality
Day.
   Idaho legislators gave final approval Friday to an official
state holiday honoring King, but only after a compromise added
Idaho Human Rights Day to the designation. The bill has gone to
Gov. Cecil Andrus, who called for its passage in January.
   New Hampshire legislators have voted down holiday proposals
first introduced in 1979. After losing in 1989, supporters said
they would try again in 1991, the next time legislative rules allow
it.
   ``There are times when New Hampshire can feel pride in its
unique posture,'' state Rep. Deborah ``Arnie'' Arnesen, said
Tuesday. ``However, I feel that our unique status, vis-a-vis this
holiday, does not suggest a badge of courage but rather a badge of
intolerance and prejudice.''
   Edward Dupont, New Hampshire's Senate Republican leader, says
the proposal won't succeed if the holiday is meant to honor King
alone. He suggested a day to honor King ``as one of many civil
rights contributors,'' including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,
rather than going along with national practice.
   ``We always have the distinction of being the last or the
first,'' he said. Montana's Legislature in 1987 approved a bill
making Jan. 15 a ``day of observance'' and creating Heritage Day, a
floating holiday to be designated by the governor. This year Gov.
Stan Stephens used it to create a long Thanksgiving weekend,
causing no controversy in a state whose black population was
counted at 1,786, or a fifth of a percent, in the 1980 census.
   Arizona is the most populous state without a King holiday, but
it hasn't attained that status without contortions.
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, a conservative who opposed his
predecessor's creation of a limited paid holiday in King's honor,
proclaimed a Martin Luther King-Civil Rights Day for the third
Sunday in January instead.
   Last year, the Legislature approved King Day as a paid holiday
for state employees, and Gov. Rose Mofford signed the bill. But
opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking effect unless
it's approved in a referendum in November.
   Some of the opponents were upset by revelations about womanizing
by King or were persuaded by the Ku Klux Klan's repeated efforts to
tar King as a Communist. Others had nothing against honoring King,
but were up-at-arms that the Legislature made room in the budget
for King Day by dropping Columbus Day as a paid holiday.
   The Legislature took that course because Republican members
didn't like two alternatives: 1) combining the Lincoln and
Washington birthdays into one Presidents' Day, as the federal
government did, or 2) springing for an additional holiday.
   While a holiday costs overtime pay for indispensable workers,
Mofford and other Democrats and some moderate Republicans argued
that not having one could also be expensive. The state has faced a
sporadic boycott, especially as a convention and meeting site.
   When the National Football League's owners awarded the 1993
Super Bowl to the Phoenix area March 13, Norman Braman, head of the
site selection committee, said: ``If there is a smear on the Martin
Luther King Holiday of any kind, I will personally lead the effort
to rescind the Super Bowl. We wouldn't want to go there.''
   Phoenix and suburban Tempe, where the game would be played, have
their own King holiday.

<HEAD>Bush Meets Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday called the
emigration of Soviet Jews a ``modern Exodus,'' and some he met at a
White House Passover ceremony said anti-Semitism was increasing in
the Soviet Union.
   Natasha Stonov, a physician whose husband is still in the Soviet
Union, said that the Jewish people in the Soviet Union ``are in
panic, and it's massive panic.''
   ``During my life, a long life, I feel there is the highest level
of anti-Semitism. I may compare it with the Germany in 1938. I
think the situation for the Soviet Jew is even worse,'' she said,
speaking in English with reporters on the White House driveway.
   Asked whether Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was making
matters worse by encouraging a sense of Soviet nationalism, she
said, ``I think so. I think in the Soviet Union, nothing is
spontaneous. Everything is organized.''
   Bush invited a group of Soviet Jews, many of whom will resettle
in Israel, to a White House ceremony honoring Passover, the
eight-day celebration beginning Monday night that commemorates the
exodus of Jews from Egypt,
   Bush called Passover ``a poignant occasion in the year that has
seen freedom's lights begin to glow all over the world: in Eastern
Europe, in Central and South America, in Africa and even in the
Soviet Union.''
   ``This is a special time of rejoicing for the more than 15,000
Soviet Jews who have made their way to Israel this year.'' Bush
said.
   ``The modern Exodus is a great event for all those who delight
in human freedom,'' he said.
   Joining him at the ceremony was Vladimir Raiz and his wife
Karmella. Raiz, permitted to leave the Soviet Union late last month
after 18 years of trying, was praised by Bush as ``a brave symbol
for all refuseniks.''
   He wished the dissident and his wife ``and your children many
years of happines in your new home in Israel.''
   Karmella Raiz told reporters afterwards that the ability of her
husband to finally leave the Soviet Union ``was a big victory of
the United States government.''
   But, she noted, ``So many people are still waiting in Russia to
be free.''
   She said that, as a Lithuanian, she was particularly sensitive
to the struggles of that Baltic state to win independence from
Moscow. ``I feel pity for the people, their country cannot be
free,'' she said.
   Bush, in his White House remarks, said the United States would
continue to apply pressure on the Soviet Union to allow more Soviet
Jews to emigrate, including pressing for direct and indirect
flights to Israel.
   The Soviet Jews remaining in the Soviet Union against their
wills ``are not forgotten,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Black House Members Propose Defense Cuts, Added Domestic Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 24 black members of the House introduced
their proposed fiscal 1991 budget on Wednesday, a plan that would
dramatically alter President Bush's priorities for defense and
domestic spending.
   The Congressional Black Caucus proposal, offered on the 22nd
anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., would slash Bush's request for Pentagon spending and shift
money into social programs.
   The caucus has been offering such budgets for a decade. Congress
has never adopted the proposals, but they are generally seen as the
liberal expression of how federal resources should be divided up.
   ``We can provide for a proper national security defense posture
and increase spending for vitally needed social programs,'' said
the caucus' chairman, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif.
   The black caucus would slash military spending to $280 billion,
$24 billion below the level Bush wants.
   It rejects the $5.5 billion in cuts Bush has requested in
Medicare aid to the elderly and handicapped. It boosts federal
welfare programs by $5.3 billion and adds $4 billion to the $45
billion Bush is seeking for education and job training programs.
   The plan would raise $19.8 billion in new tax revenues _ $5.9
billion more than Bush _ by placing a 10 percent surcharge on the
country's top-earning corporations, and by raising the tax rate on
the nation's wealthiest individuals.
   The House and Senate budget committees hope to finish work on
the 1991 budget later this month.

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Wednesday
he will try to enter Lithuania, without a Soviet visa, to show the
Soviet Union that the United States opposes the use of force in the
Baltics.
   ``I think it's incumbent upon the United States, our Congress,
our people, and those people who cherish freedom throughout the
world, to stand and to say, `If you want trade concessions, Mr.
Gorbachev, if you want access to our technological achievements, if
you want to have the normalization of relationshps, then you make
sure you don't suppress the rights of Lithuanians and others,'''
D'Amato said at a news conference.
   D'Amato planned to leave Wednesday night on a commercial flight
to Warsaw, Poland. He was traveling with several Senate staffers,
at least one translator and several reporters.
   In Poland, the group was to be met by the Lithuanian foreign
minister and other Lithuanian government officials who planned to
accompany them on the attempted border crossing, probably Friday.
   D'Amato, who holds a Lithuanian visa, had been invited into the
country by Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis.
   The senator admitted it was not very likely he'd succeed in
crossing the border, which the Soviets closed Tuesday. But he said
the trip would be a success anyway, because his message would get
to the Lithuanian people.
   Neither the White House nor the State Department tried to
discourage him from making the trip, D'Amato said.nesday.
Therefore, he suggested, he had the administration's unspoken
permission to play the heavy on Lithuania while President Bush
continued a moderate stand.
   ``If you want to say `Bad cop, good cop,' then we should be the
bad cop,'' he said.

<HEAD>South Korea Agrees to Withdrawal of 7,000 American Troops by 1993</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea has formally agreed to a
U.S. plan to cut 7,000 of the 43,000 American troops stationed in
the country by 1993, the Defense Ministry announced Wednesday.
   The ministry said the two countries also agreed to change their
joint command system to give South Korea more control over its
military.
   ``We have reached full agreement on a gradual U.S. troop
withdrawal, which will initially affect 7,000 noncombatants,'' a
ministry statement said.
   The announcement had been expected since February, when Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney disclosed plans to close three of the five
U.S. air bases in South Korea to save money.
   In talks with Seoul officials, U.S. officials indicated they
would pull out 5,000 ground troops, all noncombatants, and 2,000
air support personnel in several years.
   The ministry said American troop withdrawal from South Korea
would be made in three stages, with the first stage affecting 7,000
soldiers in the 1990-93 period.
   After the first stage, officials of the two countries will
review the situation on the Korean peninsula, including North
Korea's war capability, to decide whether to push further cuts in
the 1994-95 period, it said.
   Third-stage cuts, if needed, would take place after 1996, it
said.
   The ministry said the two countries also have agreed to alter
their joint command system to give South Korea more control over
its armed forces, the ministry said.
   Currently, most of South Korea's 650,000-member armed forces
remain under the operation control of a four-star U.S. general in a
combined command system officials say is aimed at maximizing combat
efficiency.
   The system has been criticized by radical Korean students and
dissidents as an example of American infringement upon South Korean
sovereignty.
   The ministry said the system would be changed in the 1994-95
period, allowing South Korean generals to command their units in
peacetime. In wartime, the joint command system would be restored,
it said.
   Details of the change would be discussed at annual security
consultative talks to be held in Washington in November, ministry
officials said.
   Other issues under discussion between the two countries include
appointment of a South Korean general to head the United Nations
Command in armistice talks with North Korea, replacing a U.S. Navy
admiral, they said.
   The command consists of the United States and 15 other free
world countries that fought on South Korea's side during the
1950-53 Korean War.
   Also under discussion is the replacement of U.S. troops guarding
the border village of Panmunjom and its vicinity with South Korean
soldiers, the officials said.
   Nearly all of the 155-mile border with North Korea is guarded by
South Korean troops. The 2nd U.S. Infantry Division, the only
American combat division in South Korea, is based away from the
border.

<HEAD>Coastal Anti-Pollution Bill Advances</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to reduce pollution in coastal
waters was approved Wednesday by the House Fisheries and Wildlife
subcommittee.
   The bill would establish clean-water standards for ocean water,
would require polluters to pay for cleanup and would police
pollution from such diverse sources as storm drains and farms.
   Called the ``Coastal Defense Initiative,'' the bill would impose
new penalties for industries, farmers, government agencies and
individuals that pollute the ocean or coastal waterways. It would
also involve collecting $150 million per year in new fees from
those who legally discharge pollutants into the ocean.
   The new system of penalties is designed to ``take the profit out
of violating our water pollution laws,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds,
D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Next stop for the bill is the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, which is expected to send it to the House floor.

   Three powerful House Democrats said Thursday
aid to Zaire should be eliminated because President Sese Seko
Mobutu is corrupt and abuses human rights.
   ``No bill that bears my name will have any money for that
turkey,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., referring to Mobutu.
   Obey, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee on
foreign operations, was joined by Reps. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Africa subcommittee, and Stephen Solarz, head
of the House Asia subcommittee, in seeking to slash all but
development aid to Zaire.
   ``The time has come to cut this character off,'' said Solarz,
who compared Mobutu to ousted dictators like Ferninand Marcos in
the Phillippines and Nicolai Ceausescu in Romania.
   Solarz said conservative estimates put Mobutu's personal fortune
at $2.5 billion, some of it siphoned off from the state. For
instance, some $400 million in mineral revenues is missing from the
Zaire budget, according to The World Bank.
   Mobutu reportedly has a 16th century castle in Spain, a 32-room
palace in Lausanne, Switzerland, a $750,000 apartment in Paris and
luxurious estates in Portugal, Italy and several African countries,
Solarz said.
   Wolpe said he backed eliminating all military aid to Zaire and
requiring that aid for food, development and health programs be
given to private non-governmental groups instead of to the
government. Congress required that provision last year.
   He said he wanted to end the assistance because ``most
government-to-government economic aid as well as military aid such
assistance condones government corruption.''
   Human rights violations are commonplace in Zaire, Wolpe said.
The State Department said in its annual human rights report that
security organizations harass, detain and physically mistreat the
government's political opponents.
   Secretary of State James Baker III visited Zaire last month and
reportedly brought up the case of two American human rights lawyers
who were attacked and robbed in Kinshasa, Wolpe said.
   The United States has long view Zaire as an ally and uses the
mineral-rich former French colony as a transit point through which
to ship weapons to anti-communist rebels in Angola. Wolpe has
called for an end to the covert program in Angola.
   The Bush administration is seeking a total of $53 million in aid
to Zaire, including $4 million for the military, $33 million for
development and $16 million for food.

   The United States called Wednesday for a
roundup of firearms passed out to civilians by Nicaragua's
Sandinista government after its election defeat in February.
   ``An immediate gathering of weapons that have been handed out to
civilians in recent weeks would help create conditions of
confidence that would further the demobilization process, State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.
   She said that for demobilization of military forces to proceed
in Nicaragua,it is essential that an expanded United Nations
observer force be deployed at once to verify a mutual ceasefire
between Sandinista forces and the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   ``Artificial deadlines will not solve the problem,'' she said.
``It must be solved on the ground, with adequate security
guarantees and verification mechanisms.''
   She noted that the March 27 agreement between UNO, the party of
President-elect Violeta Chamorro, and the Sandinista government,
states that all weapons should be in the hands of the armed forces.
   On another subject, Ms. Tutwiler said the United States is
encouraged that the United Nations has been able bring about the
resumption of dialogue between the government of El Salvador and
that country's leftist guerillas.
   ``There is no military solution in El Salvador,'' she said.
``Only a negotiated political settlement can end the violence so
that necessary reforms can be advanced.''
   She said Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani fully supported
resumption of the talks with what she said was the ``strong, strong
backing'' of the Salvadoran armed forces.
   ``The worldwide winds of change away from violence and toward
democracy and reconciliation have reached Central America,'' she
said.
   ``We hope that these negotiations will bring about an end to the
violence so that Salvadoran democracy can be consolidated and the
Salvadoran people can move towards reconciliation and real economic
development.''

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Wednesday
he had enough support in parliament to form a ruling coalition and
requested a special session to approve the new government.
   Peres refused to name the members of the proposed government. He
said secrecy was necessary as he tried to recruit more lawmakers
into a broader government. But radio reports questioned whether the
Labor leader actually had the needed votes.
   ``I said we have a majority. More than that I won't say,'' Peres
said on Israel radio.
   If Peres succeeds, the new government may move toward accepting
U.S. proposals for starting Middle East peace talks. Yizhak
Shamir's refusal to accept the proposals led to the fall of his
government March 15.
   Peres' Labor Party had accepted compromise proposals by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for opening a dialogue with
Palestinians as a step toward Israeli-proposed elections in the
occupied territories.
   Conservatives in the coalition government that was headed by
Shamir refused to go along, creating an impasse that led to a vote
of no-confidence against Shamir's government.
   Peres notified President Chaim Herzog that he had succeeded in
getting majority backing in the 120-member parliament, or Knesset,
to replace the coalition.
   He said he had appealed to the speaker of parliament to convene
the legislature ``as soon as possible,'' preferably by Sunday, to
approve the new government.
   Peres and other Labor leaders refused to provide details on the
composition of the new government.
   ``I have time until the Knesset convenes to make the list and
divide portfolios. There is still work before us,'' Peres said.
   Until earlier Wednesday, Peres had only 60 assured votes. He
needed at least one more legislator to vote with him or abstain.
   State-run Israel and army radio stations quoted sources from the
rival Likud bloc as saying they doubted Peres had the needed votes.
They speculated he was simply trying to lure more supporters.
   Other reports said Peres succeeded in enticing a defector from
the right-wing Likud, led by Shamir.
   Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement identified
the legislator as Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister. Sharir
could not be reached for comment.
   Sarid and leaders of two other left-wing parties _ Mapam and
Shinui _ questioned the wisdom of bringing a defector into the
government. They said it was not certain whether they would join
such a Cabinet.
   ``We see this as a problem that goes to the very core of Israeli
democracy,'' said Amnon Rubinstein of Shinui. ``I resigned from the
government over peace, but democracy is also important to me.''
   However, the leaders of the three parties said they might vote
in support of such a coalition during the special Knesset session.
Their 10 votes would still allow Peres to form the government.
   Labor legislators Chaim Ramon and Moshe Shahal said the party
had decided on secrecy concerning the composition of the government
because it did not want to expose defectors or parties willing to
join a Labor government to pressure from Likud.
   ``The political system is full of pressure on all those who want
to support this government,'' Ramon said on army radio.
   With the parliament vote not likely until Sunday, Likud has time
to try to lure potential Labor coalition partners back into its
fold.
   If Peres wins the vote of confidence in parliament, it could be
the first time since 1977 that Labor rules without Likud. The two
parties have shared power in coalition governments since 1984
following inconclusive elections.
   Peres was prime minister from September 1984 until October of
1986.
   Peres said he and his Labor colleagues had worked with a
``candle at our feet'' in order to form the new government before
the beginning of Passover on April 9.
   ``If we didn't succeed in putting together the government before
Passover, we would have stood for long weeks without a functioning
government, without the defense ministry manned, with waves of
immigrants to be absorbed, and with serious economic problems,''
Peres said.
   Shamir's coaltion, formed in December 1988, fell at a crucial
time as Israel faced key questions on the peace process and on how
to handle a wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   The Baker compromises that split Labor and Likud called for
Israel to accept Palestinian negotiators in preliminary talks who
were deported from the occupied territories or who have ties to
Arab east Jerusalem.
   Hard-liners in the right-wing party argued the two steps could
bring the Palestine Liberation Organization into the peace process.
They also said the moves might raise questions about Israel's hold
over the eastern half of Jerusalem, which it captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and refuses to
deal with it.

   Hungary on Wednesday dropped the last

   Although Hungarians did not perceive their ``liberation'' as

by much pomp and ceremony.
   But Wednesday's issue of the trade union daily Nepszava said the
``liberation'' of Hungary by the Soviet army at the end of the war
failed to stop the suffering in the country.
   ``Out of the blood and filth, the suffering and tragedy, not
freedom, not independence, not democracy were born, but the
occupation and oppression of the nation (by Soviet troops),'' the
paper said.
   ``Let us bid goodbye to a holiday and to an empire celebrated
under duress,'' it added.
   Soviet troops have been in Hungary since the end of World War
II, associated mostly with the bloody crushing of the 1956
anti-Communist uprising for more democracy and a multiparty system.
   Moscow agreed to withdraw its troops in the initial days of the
revolt, but instead of departing, the Red Army poured in
reinforcements to quash the uprising.
   Under a historic bilateral agreement last month to remove all
Soviet soldiers from the country by mid-1991, the first Red Army
troops began to leave Hungary on March 12. Moscow has about 49,000
troops stationed in Hungary.
   On March 25, Hungarians went to the polls for the first free
multiparty elections in more than 40 years and voted the Communists
and their successors the Socialists out of power.
   Last year, parliament abolished Nov. 7 _ the day of the
Bolshevik revolution in Russia _ as a national holiday.
   It was replaced by March 15, the anniversary of the abortive
1848 revolution for independence from Austrian Habsburg rule.

<HEAD>Barco Offers Colombian Trial to Medellin Cartel Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco on Wednesday
promised that if the head of the Medellin drug cartel surrenders,
he will not be extradited to the United States and will receive a
fair trial in Colombia.
   A few hours later, the Medellin cartel threatened to kill a
senator and explode a bomb in the capital if three men arrested
last week are not released. The three are believed to be security
men for the traffickers.
   Scores of policemen from an anti-terrorist strike force began
arriving in Medellin, where traffickers' gunmen have killed 11
policemen in two days.
   Barco did not explain why he made his offer to cartel chief
Pablo Escobar. He had repeatedly said he would not negotiate with
traffickers, and last week the government extradited its 15th drug
suspect to the United States since declaring war on drug lords last
August.
   The drug traffickers have said they would rather die than face
trial in the United States and have offered to turn themselves in
if they are not extradited.
   ``Mr. Escobar has said that he is going to give himself up, and
I say that if he surrenders, I guarantee the (Colombian) judges
will judge him with complete impartiality,'' Barco told the
Colombian radio network RCN.
   U.S. Justice Department officials say Escobar runs the world's
most powerful cocaine traficking organization. Like all other
trafficking suspects in Colombia, Escobar does not face any drug
charges in his own country.
   Barco did not say what charges Escobar would be tried on if he
surrendered. He is charged with several murders, including that of
newsman Guillermo Cano. The publisher of the Bogota daily El
Espectador was slain Dec. 17, 1987. His newspaper had urged
government action against drug lords.
   National police say Escobar also ordered last month's slaying of
a presidential candidate of the leftist Patriot Union Party.
Bernardo Jaramillo, who was running in the May 26 election, was
assassinated March 22 at Bogota's international airport.
   The drug war began when traffickers killed Luis Carlos Galan,
the governing party's presidential hopeful.
   Police reinforcements began arriving Wednesday in the
northwestern city of Medellin. Eleven policemen were killed and
eight were wounded Monday and Tuesday in the city of 2 million
people.
   The Medellin police chief, Col. Alberto Otalora, said Tuesday
that drug traffickers shot all the policemen. Last week, the
Medellin cartel said in a communique it was offering a $4,300
reward for every policeman killed.
   In the last week, 11 wealthy people have been kidnapped by drug
traffickers in Medellin, police communiques have said. The latest
was federal Sen. Federeico Estrada, abducted Tuesday.
   In a communique released Wednesday, after Barco's announcement,
the cartel threatened to kill Estrada. It also repeated its threat
to exploded an 11,000-pound bomb in Bogota if three men arrested
last week are not freed.
   The communique, like all the cartel's messages, came via fax to
Colombian radio networks. The communique carried the cartel's
persistent message: ``We prefer a grave in Colombia to a prison in
the United States.''

   Police used tear gas to break up a
demonstration by the opposition party on Wednesday, the West
African nation's 30th anniversary of independence.
   The demonstrators, members of the Senegalese Democratic Party,
attempted a parade parallel to the official independence march.
Police blocked the demonstrators from entering downtown.
   After police fired tear gas, the marchers burned several
vehicles and smashed store windows, witnesses said.
   The Senegalese Democratic Party and its leader, Adoulaye Wade,
claim they won the Feb. 28, 1988, elections in one of the handful
of multiparty democracies in Africa.
   Official returns gave President Abdou Diouf's Senegalese
Socialist Party 73 percent of the votes, prompting extensive riots
in the capital and several other cities.

<HEAD>Government Panel Calls For Less Logging to Preserve Spotted Owl
Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Logging must stop across a large section of
national forests in the Pacific Northwest to keep the northern
spotted owl from becoming extinct, a government panel of scientists
said Wednesday.
   Environmentalists hailed the recommendations as an important
step toward listing the owl as a threatened or endangered species,
but industry leaders said the panel's proposals could devastate the
region's timber-based economy.
   The interagency committee, led by U.S. Forest Service biologist
Jack Ward Thomas, recommended in a report a reduction of about 25
percent in the allowable cut in national forests and a 30 percent
to 40 percent reduction on Bureau of Land Management areas.
   ``We have concluded that the owl is imperiled over significant
portions of its range because of continuing losses of habitat from
logging and natural disturbances,'' the report said. ``Current
management strategies are inadequate to ensure its viability.''
   The panel's recommendation is expected to weigh heavily in the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision on whether to list the
owl as a threatened or endangered species. The service, which must
make a decision by June 23, extended its public comment period
until April 11 to receive the panel's recommendation.
   ``Make no mistake about it, this is a very influential
document,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore. ``Here's the bluest of
blue-ribbon committees yet put together, and it has recommended a
(logging) reduction .... They say that's the minimum necessary to
sustain a population of owls.''
   The owl lives primarily in the never-logged old-growth of
western Washington and Oregon. It's population has been reduced by
about 60 percent since 1800, the report said.
   Thomas said during a congressional hearing Wednesday that if
future federal harvests continued at current levels, there would be
a dramatic reduction in the owl's population, especially on
Washington's Olympic Peninsula.
   ``Certainly we would see local extinction. Ultimately, I think
we would see (overall) extinction. I don't know how long it would
take,'' he said.
   Thomas said there currently are about 1,700 breeding pairs of
owls in the Northwest. He said if the panel's proposals are
implemented the number could grow to 2,200 pairs within 100 years
``if everything went right.''
   The study recommends current timber sales on federal lands
continue as scheduled through the end of September, the end of the
fiscal year.
   The report was delivered Wednesday to a joint meeting of the
Agriculture Subcommittee on Forests, Family Farms and Energy; the
Interior Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands; and the
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on Fisheries and
Wildlife Conservation.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said his
calculations indicated the recommendations would reduce timber-sale
programs on national forests with owls by 1 billion to 1.3 billion
board feet. That would be 30 percent to 40 percent below an
already-reduced harvest level that resulted from a compromise
worked out last year to ease the immediate threat to the spotted
owl.
   ``National forests' gross revenues will decline, resulting in a
loss of payments to counties, although these reductions may be
offset with a rise in prices because of log shortages,'' he said.
   Robertson said the recommendations would affect 2.7 million
acres of the Forest Service's commercial timber base, including
about 1.9 million acres in Oregon and Washington and about 800,000
acres in northern California.
   Robertson said Thomas predicted more than 6 million acres would
be affected overall, but that many of those acres already are being
protected.
   Cy Jamison, director of the Bureau of Land Management, said the
total cut on BLM lands in western Oregon would drop about 335
million board feet, or between 30 percent and 40 percent, if the
proposals were adopted.

<HEAD>About 25 More Prisoners Surrender, Negotiations Split</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five inmates surrendered at
devastated Strangeways Prison on Wednesday and authorities
negotiated individually with others in an attempt to end a
4-day-old uprising.
   ``Our tactic is to persist in patient negotiations to bring this
dreadful event to a successful conclusion,'' said Terry Bone,
deputy director of the north region of the Prison Service.
   Solicitor Barry Cuttle, a member of the negotiating team, said
20 to 25 prisoners remained inside the Victorian prison, which was
severely overcrowded when the rioting began Sunday.
   ``A lot of them are very keen to come out and never wanted to
have anything to do with this,'' he said. ``I can't say whether
they were stopped from coming out, or remained from some misguided
sense of loyalty.''
   One prisoner, Derek White, died Tuesday of injuries suffered in
the first day of the disturbance. White was awaiting trial on
charges of assaulting three children.
   British media have speculated that up to 30 prisoners died in
the rioting _ mainly sex offenders who are despised by other
inmates. Cuttle said he had seen no bodies. Dozens of prisoners and
guards were injured in the chaos.
   Bone said the authorities were trying to make sure facilities
for the remaining inmates were reduced to ``an absolute minimum,''
though water was available from prison tanks.
   ``It is still a very confused situation, and it is possible that
some food has been taken out of the kitchen and other areas of the
prison,'' Bone said.
   Prison governor Brendan O'Friel, who characterized the uprising
as ``an explosion of evil,'' told reporters more than 1,500 inmates
had been caught up in the violence and vandalism.
   Cuttle characterized the attitude of the remaining inmates as
``calm, more reasonable, listening to the prison officers' side ...
They're seeing sense.''
   He said negotiators were moving through various parts of the
prison to speak with individual prisoners who asked to negotiate.
   Asked why the prisoners had rioted, Cuttle said: ``They've all
got their own personal reasons.''
   Prison authorities apparently hoped snowy weather would drive
the inmates out of their unheated and unlighted quarters. But
bright sunshine lured many inmates to the roof, from where they
could see as many as 300 supporters standing outside. By late
afternoon, most had gone inside.
   The editor of the Manchester Evening News, who spent 10 hours
inside the prison Tuesday as a neutral observer requested by the
prisoners, said inmates complained of ``mental and physical
brutality, misuse of drugs in controlling prisoners, poor food and
cramped conditions.''
   Strangeways was built in 1868 to hold 970 men, but held 1,648
prisoners when the riot broke out. It contains inmates of all
categories, from extremely dangerous to low risk.
   In a story in Wednesday's edition of the News, editor Michael
Unger said the areas he saw were devastated.
   ``Strewn around the stench-filled wings were smashed toilets,
wrecked television sets, ripped-out telephones, and huge steel
doors ripped off their hinges. Water was pouring down, and the
stink of burning was almost too much to bear,'' Unger wrote.
   O'Friel told reporters Wednesday morning that the standoff was
``a delicate and difficult situation.''
   ``My hope is that these negotiations will result in a peaceful
end to this incident,'' he said.
   Following the death of her husband, White's pregnant,
24-year-old wife Jean called for the inmates to end the siege.
   ``I want them to know that my child will grow up without knowing
its daddy,'' Mrs. White said. ``Now they have nothing to gain and
should give themselves up.''
   White's attorney, Basil Herwald, said his client had been
refused bail even though prosecutors indicated he would face trial
on only one of eight charges. Herwald said White's death was an
example of ``how the system fails the innocent.''
   ``Strangeways was a filthy inhumane system for the innocent and
the guilty,'' Herwald said.

   A British Airways Concorde jet en route from

made an emergency landing Wednesday night at Heathrow Airport after
discovering a problem in one of its four engines, the airline said.
   Fire engines and ambulances stood by as the supersonic jet,
Flight BA003 with about 80 passengers on board, landed safely at
Heathrow Airport without incident.
   A British Airways spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
described the incident as ``absolutely routine.''
   ``There was a problem with the intake nozzle of the No. 3 engine
so the captain decided to return. There was no drama and he turned

   Passengers were tranferred to a back-up Concorde, he said.

   The parents of a 13-year-old murder
victim were comforted at home Wednesday by family and friends. Four
doors down, the family of the murderer returned to the hatred of
once-friendly neighbors.
   While there was relief over Tuesday's conviction of Robert
Golub, the rage and ugliness that has pervaded Horton Road since
the March 3, 1989, slaying of Kelly Ann Tinyes remained on the
street.
   ``It's a nightmare. ... It's very difficult having the Golubs
still living here,'' Kelly's mother, Victoria, said as she sat
inside her red-shingled home.
   ``I don't know how they could possibly walk back into that house
after what happened there,'' she continued. ``It has to say
something about what kind of people they are.''
   Golub, 22, was convicted of second-degree murder. He faces a
possible sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
   Kelly's battered, slashed body was found in the Golubs' basement
a day after she disappeared. Prosecutors said Golub lured her there
with a phone call, then beat, strangled and sexually mutilated her.
   On Wednesday, trees along the block were tied with pink and
black ribbons, a memorial to Kelly.
   While visitors poured in and out of the Tinyes' home, the
Golubs' house stood silent, its doors and windows shut tight and
three police cars parked outside. Thirteen months ago, Kelly's body
was found in a closet in the basement of Golub's home.
   John Golub, standing in his driveway a day after his son's
conviction, said he no longer feels sympathy for the Tinyes. The
families have lived on the street for two decades.
   ``In the beginning, we cried for their daughter just as much as
they did,'' said Golub. ``But I feel no sorrow for them now.
They've burned it out of us.''
   ``They created this monster,'' said Kelly's father, Richard, who
owns a salvage company. Neighbors on the quiet one-way street agree.
   ``For 14 months, the neighbors were telling the world that this
boy was guilty. Now everyone knows it,'' said Tom Callahan, who has
lived next to the Golubs for 31 years. ``People on this street have
been living with this horror seven days a week.''
   Callahan knows first-hand how deeply the killing has affected
the neighborhood. His 9-year-old daughter, Donna, took the witness
stand at an age when most children are busy with homework and
hobbies.
   ``I knew he was guilty,'' said Donna, who was the last person to
see Kelly before she entered the Golub home on the day she died.
``Justice is done, but it's not going to bring Kelly back. We were
friends.''
   Golub, a service station operator, said other neighbors make
obscene gestures or shout at his family as they drive past. Windows
have been broken in his home and fires set in his garbage.
   ``We want to move, there's no question about it,'' said Golub.
``We'd like to pack up and move to Florida, but we'd have to give
the house away.'' He can't afford to do that, he said, because his
son's unsuccessful defense cost $50,000.

<TEXT>
   Reducing production of the B-2 bomber will
raise the cost of a single plane to more than $1 billion, says a
congressional study that several lawmakers on Wednesday called
grounds for canceling the ``flying Fort Knox.''
   ``It confirms my very worst fears that if you stretch out the
B-2 program it simply adds billions of dollars to its costs,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., as he joined with a bipartisan group of
B-2 opponents in releasing the Congressional Budget Office report.
   Leahy and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., introduced legislation
to stop procurement of the stealth aircraft at the 15 planes now in
production.
   The Bush administration's plans call for building 132 of the
radar-evading aircraft by 1996 at a cost of more than $70 billion.
Air Force Secretary Donald Rice told a congressional panel Tuesday
that the Bush administration is weighing alternatives to that
proposal.
   According to the CBO study, canceling the program would save
$41.5 billion.
   ``What we ought to do is have the guts now to say enough is
enough and stop at the 15 that are in production,'' Leahy told a
Capitol Hill news conference.
   Legislation to kill the B-2 garnered just over 30 votes in the
Senate last year. Leahy and Cranston said they have ``picked up
strength'' but declined to provide numbers on the opponents.
   However, Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., said Wednesday that a head
count in the House indicates that 195 members oppose the bomber.
   The CBO report concluded that if the Air Force reduces its
planned buy of 132 to 66 the total cost of the program, which the
agency estimates is about $75 billion, will be reduced by $18.6
billion.
   However, the cost of a single plane _ now estimated at $530
million _ will rise to $860 million.
   If the administration decides to buy 33 planes, at a rate of
three per year, the bomber would cost $1.7 billion a copy.
   ``The stealth is a budgetary black hole _ it attracts and
devours public funds like a condensed star attracts and devours
light,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who joined Leahy,
Cranston and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., at the news conference.
   Further complicating the B-2 issue is the annual cost of the
program. In the mid-1990s, the Pentagon plans to buy 10 planes in a
single year and 24 the next year. Budget requests would then total
nearly $10 billion a year.
   Leahy pointed out that last year Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
urged Congress not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the program
because stretching out the program would drastically increase the
cost.
   ``He's right. The CBO report shows he's absolutely right,''
Leahy said of Cheney.
   The Vermont senator added that ``if we stretch it out as some
who are trying desperately to save this flying Fort Knox, that
assumes two or three years from now that we'll find $8 billion or
$9 billion in the budget for that year's procurement alone.''
   ``Nobody in their right mind thinks that we're going to find
that much money in any one year.''
   Cranston said the ``Pentagon is on notice: The B-2 won't fly in
Congress. Not 132, not 66, not even 33.''

<HEAD>Wisconsin Governor Says Veto Rejection Won't Change his Actions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor said Wednesday that being
stripped of a veto power that enabled him to strip letters from
words of bills would not stop him from altering the meaning of
unacceptable legislation.
   ``Absolutely not,'' Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said a day after
voters approved by 62 percent a constitutional amendment curtailing
that power named after ``Wheel of Fortune'' letter-turner Vanna
White.
   ``I'm not going to hold back on vetoes at all.''
   Elsewhere, voters in Kansas City, Mo., rejected a curbside
recycling program that would have cost households $1.89 a month.
St. Louis voters approved a 3.5 percent hotel-motel tax increase to
help build a 70,000-seat, domed stadium.
   Thompson once used his veto to change the amount of time a
juvenile could be held in detention, crossing out ``48 hours''
along with selective letters to make the time read ``t-e-n day-s.''
   The veto was criticized by opponents who said it gave the
governor unconstitutional power to change the meaning of
legislation.
   ``I'm not overly excited about it but the people had a choice
and I will live by it,'' Thompson said, adding he would not use the
``Vanna'' veto on the 221 bills pending on his desk.
   The amendment still allows the governor to delete numbers, words
or sentences with a veto. A lawsuit is pending in federal court
that challenges his right to strike numbers and decimals from
legislation.
   State Rep. David Travis, a Democrat who backed the amendment,
vowed to seek further limits on the veto power.
   ``We wanted it to be power to turn something down, not create
it,'' Travis said.
   Wisconsin voters also re-elected Supreme Court Justice Donald
Steinmetz to a second 10-year term, despite claims by Steinmetz's
opponent, a deaf appeals judge, that the high court was not working
hard enough.
   Steinmetz received 52 percent of votes to challenger Richard S.
Brown's 48 percent, according to unofficial returns. Steinmetz
acknowledged that Brown may have raised valid concerns about the
court.
   Chief Justice Nathan S. Heffernan declined Wednesday to say how
the election campaign might affect the court.
   ``I'm not about to say that the reputation of the Supreme Court
was enhanced or hurt by the election,'' Heffernan said. ``It might
have helped. Criticism is always good for people as well as
institutions.''
   In northern Wisconsin, state Rep. Jim Holperin defeated
challenger Brian Sherren in the state's first legislative recall
election in 58 years. Holperin was targeted by those opposed to
allowing Chippewa Indians to exercise treaty rights to go
spearfishing off the reservation.

   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater

to appoint a presidential press secretary.
   ``I can only assume that (Gorbachev) took a look at my

   Fitzwater was referring to the appointment of Arkady
Maslennikov, 58, as Gorbachev's chief spokesman.
   Fitzwater said he had not met Maslennikov previously but planned
to send him a congratulatory message and hoped to meet him at an
expected superpower summit in June.
   Maslennikov, making his debut before the Moscow news corps
Tuesday, played down his image. ``I'm not Marlin Fitzwater. I am

   Janis T. Gabay of San Diego, teacher of the
year with a crystal apple and a presidential salute to show for it,
says she once thought of quitting because she saw such lack of
respect for her profession.
   But Ms. Gabay declared herself optimistic about U.S. education
Wednesday as President Bush and his wife, Barbara, honored her at
the White House.
   ``The kind of people Jan represents are ambassadors to the most
powerful province mankind might command _ that great undiscovered
realm right under your hat,'' Bush told a crowd that included 11
members of Ms. Gabay's family.
   ``For almost 40 years, the Teacher of the Year program has
singled out the few, really because they represent the many,'' he
said. ``The program's goal is really not to identify the best
teacher but the best in all teachers.''
   Fighting back tears, the petite high school English teacher
accepted the award from Bush and a kiss from the first lady,
thanking officials for giving ``a credible and assertive voice to
this nation's concerns about education.''
   Earlier, in an interview, she said, ``It is very easy to become
disillusioned from all that we hear outside of education itself. It
feels like oftentimes we are not supported. We're not acknowledged.
We're seen as those people who do those tasks, rather than as
professionals.''
   ``That disappoints me and personally even affected me at one
point where I really stopped to reconsider whether I was in the
right profession,'' said the high school English teacher.
   Ms. Gabay said she is happy she was able to shake the doubts.
   ``I'm very optimistic about education,'' she said. ``I cannot be
a teacher without being an optimist. I have great faith in the
abilities of our students. That's my job _ to tap that, to elicit
that, to bring out that performance. Every student is full of
marvelous potential.''
   She said teachers must be seen as professionals, who if given
the support and resources, can push students to become top
achievers.
   Gaining respect is no problem for her personally, according to
one student at San Diego's Junipero Serra High School where she has
taught 10th and 12th grade English the past 10 years.
   Steve Nguyen, 17, said Wednesday, ``I am Vietnamese and in my
culture, the teacher has absolute power and respect. Here, teachers
don't get much respect. But Ms. Gabay gets it from her students. No
one ditches this class.''
   ``To Ms. Gabay there is no wrong answer. That's why she really
can bring out the critical thinking in all of us,'' the student
said.
   Ms. Gabay, 39, was born in Hawaii and came to San Diego as a
child. A graduate of San Diego State University, she has been a
teacher for 17 years in all.
   As 1990 National Teacher of the Year, she said, ``I stand for
the superior teaching that does in fact occur in hundreds of
classrooms across the country.''
   An innovative teacher, Ms. Gabay in 1983 helped organize a
program, with the San Diego Union, in which students review, for
pay, children's and young adult books for the newspaper.
   In passing on her love of writing and literature to her students
and colleagues, she said her focus is on ``the entire range of
human experience.''
   ``I offer my students as many ideas as I can by showing them
through literature that there is nothing that has not already been
felt, experienced or thought, but much to be discovered in a new
way.''
   She was chosen from among the nation's more than 2.5 million
elementary and secondary public school teachers by a special panel
formed by the Council of Chief State School Officers.
   As teacher of the year, Ms. Gabay said she will encourage
various groups during her yearlong ``ambassadorship'' to work
together to bring about quality education.
   Gordon Ambach, executive director of the School Officers group,
which sponsors the program in partnership with Encyclopaedia
Britannica Inc., said the program has taken on an international
focus as last year's winner Mary V. Bicouvaris of Hampton, Va.,
recently visited the Soviet Union and both the 1988 and 1989
winners visited Japan.
   The other finalists this year were Rachel S. Moreno, a Spanish
teacher at Flowing Wells High School in Tucson, Ariz.; Billy Dean
Nave Jr., from the River Valley Alternative School in Winthrop,
Maine, and Maria McAlister Pyles, a social studies teacher at
Greenwood High School in Greenwood, S.C.

<TEXT>
   People who live in the shadow of the
Conoco refinery on Ponca City's south side are glad a dispute about
allegedly tainted groundwater is nearing an end with a tentative
multimillion dollar settlement.
   But, for many, the worries are switching from their health to
their future as they must think about selling homes they have lived
in for decades.
   ``I've been here for 40 years and I'm no spring chicken
anymore,'' Sadie Barnett, 74, said Wednesday. ``It has been
upsetting to a lot of people.''
   Like some, Mrs. Barnett said it was about time Conoco did
something about the fumes and chemical-laced groundwater that
seeped into basements and has been blamed for killing lawns, trees
and flowers.
   The subsidiary of Du Pont announced Monday a $23 million
settlement proposal, which includes $18 million to buy about 400
homes nearest the refinery and $5 million for the establishment of
a settlement fund.
   The company proposed the settlement without admitting fault or
liability.
   While the settlement must be approved by a federal judge
scheduled to hear the case June 5, attorneys for the refinery said
the proposal is one of the largest corporate settlements ever
recorded in an environmental contamination lawsuit.
   Similar cases involved government money: the evacuation of homes
built atop tons of chemical waste at Love Canal in Niagara Falls,
N.Y., and the virtual abandonment in 1982 of Times Beach, Mo.,
which was tainted by dioxin.
   Although residents had fought for years for a solution to the
problems brought by the orange-tinted water, many are sad about the
thought of leaving homes that have built up a lot of memories over
the past quarter of a century. And they worry about finding places
to live that they can afford after selling their old homes.
   ``We've been in the same house for 36 years,'' said Cecil
Landis, 62, from his service station. ``My yard's been sinking.
   ``We have a cellar we can't go into because of the fumes and I
bought the house on account of the cellar.''
   ``My grandson says, `let's not move, Granny,''' Mrs. Barnett
said. ``I lost my only son and my husband 16 months apart a while
back, so it's got a lot of memories.''
   Veda Lamb, who is bedridden, said she and her husband, Roy, will
have a hard time finding a home within their reach.
   ``We can't go too high, because we're not rich,'' she said.
``There ain't no rich people that live around here.''
   Most of the people who live in the area tend to be of retirement
age and low- to moderate-income, said Chamber of Commerce
information secretary Cheryl Flink.
   Much of the area, which one resident called the ``low rent
rendezvous of Ponca City,'' is low-lying and susceptible to
standing water during heavy rain, Ms. Flink said.
   Residents are not the only ones affected by the proposed
settlement.
   Family Discount Pharmacy No. 2 owner Ron Terry said his business
will be affected.
   ``A lot of business comes from that (area),'' Terry said. ``If
those 400 homes are moved out, that will be approximately 1,600
people.
   ``They'll have to go to the east or west side of town,'' he
said. ``It will definitely change the way we're doing business down
there.''
   But Terry, who has owned the drugstore since 1981, said he's
glad for the residents.
   Ben Delaney, a former Conoco employee whose house faces the
refinery, said he doesn't blame his former employer.
   ``You can't just point the finger at one and say it's their
fault,'' said the 64-year-old retiree. ``I made a living with them
for better than 30 years.''
   Still, Delaney said he's not looking forward to leaving the
neighborhood he's lived in for so long.
   ``I've known these people. My kids grew up with them, some have
passed away,'' he said. ``It'll be difficult, but I think I can
live through it.''

<TEXT>
   A Moscow Circus clown has not been seen since
the show ended its run and the case has been turned over to police
and the U.S. government, a spokesman for the troupe said Wednesday.
   There's no indication that Sergei Uhanov is trying to defect
from the Soviet Union, said Brian Lawson, publicist for Bally's
Reno where the circus performed for two months. It closed on Sunday.
   ``At this point we're just concerned with his safety and
welfare,'' Lawson said. ``He gave no outward sign that he was
unhappy. He didn't seem upset about anything. He simply wasn't
where he was supposed to be when the troupe left.''
   A missing persons report was filed Wednesday with the Reno
Police Department, and Lawson said the State Department and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service had been notified.
   Uhanov, who hasn't been seen since Sunday night, didn't check
out of his hotel, but his possessions were gone, Lawson said.

<HEAD>Group Files Lawsuit to Halt Germ Warfare Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group said in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday that the Pentagon's biological warfare research program
should be halted because potential environmental dangers haven't
been adequately examined.
   The Foundation on Economic Trends is seeking preliminary and
permanent injunctions in U.S. District Court to terminate the
program until the Pentagon assesses possible harm from the research
in greater depth.
   An Army analysis completed last year fails to analyze safety and
security measures and emergency medical procedures at research
sites around the country, the lawsuit alleges.
   The Army study ``is grossly inadequate'' in assessing ``the
nature of the severity of the impacts'' the research ``may have on
human health and the environment,'' said the lawsuit by the
non-profit group and its president, Jeremy Rifkin.
   Laboratory research with biological materials is ``potentially
hazardous,'' concluded last year's study. But over the years,
``elaborate controls (have been developed) to assure adequate
protection for the environment.''
   The Army said last year that the process of working with deadly
toxins ``has actually become safer over the years.''
   ``Better containment equipment and facilities became available
and more effective biosafety protocols were developed.''
   The Pentagon's biological defense research program is conducted
at more than 100 military, university and private laboratories in
27 states and eight foreign countries.
   Some $90 million was spent on the program in 1989, the lawsuit
said. Last year, the Pentagon estimated the figure at $60 million
annually.
   Chuck Dasey, public affairs officer for the U.S. Army Medical
Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick, Md., declined to
comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.
   Fort Detrick is one of the biological research facilities.

<TEXT>
   Right-wing Christian militia gunners
knocked rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's television station off the air
Wednesday night in renewed fighting, and clergymen appealed for a
cease-fire in the 2-month-old power struggle.
   Twenty Maronite Catholic bishops met for three hours, then
issued a statement after meeting with patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir at
his mountain seat in the Bkirki monastery north of Beirut.
   Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, announced
acceptance of an unconditional cease-fire in his continued showdown
with Aoun for control of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   But there was no immediate word from Aoun, whose troops were
locked in escalating artillery battles with Geagea's forces.
   Earlier, Geagea called on President Elias Hrawi's army
commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, to move his 22,000 Moslem troops to
take over Aoun's bases.
   But there was no sign the Syrian-backed Hrawi would use his
poorly equipped forces to move against Aoun's battle-hardened
veterans.
   Aoun's command said the antenna at his TV station in the
mountain town of Beit Meri took direct hits in the bombardment by
Geagea's forces.
   The general's headquarters reported the station went off the air
at 7 p.m. when it was hit in a ``sudden bombardment aimed at
silencing the voice of truth. But it will be back on the air soon.''
   The statement was broadcast by Aoun's Radio Lebanon, which
continued to function.
   The Maronite clergymen, who represent Lebanon's main Christian
sect, met behind closed doors with Sfeir as artillery barrages
thundered in the hills.
   Their statement also called for a withdrawal by both forces to
barracks, a halt to propaganda warfare, an exchange of prisoners,
the reopening of all roads and for Aoun and Geagea to work out a
settlement ``that guarantees the existence of the Christians and
their rights.''
   Fifteen cease-fires negotiated by various parties since Jan. 30
have all collapsed.
   The bishops told Aoun and Geagea, both Maronites, that if they
could not halt the fighting ``then it is our duty to tell you both
that your persistence in shouldering the responsibility means
persistence in wrecking the Christians' 2,000-year-old existence in
Lebanon and thus the destruction of Lebanon.''
   Geagea said he ordered the media under his control to stop all
anti-Aoun propaganda at midnight.
   ``We're ready to facilitate all security and political solutions
on the basis of the unity of all political and military
establishments under the helm of legitimacy,'' Geagea said in a
statement.
   But the fighting continued.
   Earlier, an apartment block in east Beirut was set afire by
phosphorus shells fired by Aoun's troops in the day-long clashes in
the Christian sector of the divided capital and the Kesrouan
mountains to the mortheast.
   But police reported no casualties since the families living in
the five-story block were hiding in their basement shelter.
   Nor were there any reports of casualties in other sectors of the
Christian enclave, including the Kesrouan mountains, where the two
sides clashed with howitzers, mortars and machine guns.
   By police count, at least 839 people have been killed and 2,295
wounded since Jan. 30, when Aoun moved against Geagea in a bid to
crush the main challenger to his claim to be the sole authority in
the enclave.
   Police estimate that about 250,000 people, one-quarter of the
enclave's population, have fled to safer areas in Lebanon or left
the country since the fighting broke out.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
committee's report referred to Hrawi as ``the legitimate head of
state'' and described an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end
Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war as ``a way leading to peace.''
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's election Nov. 24 to implement the
peace accord worked out by Lebanese lawmakers in the Saudi Arabian
resort of Taif last October.
   The general also rejects the accord because it does not
guarantee the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   They entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. But Aoun has branded the Syrians an occupation army that
has sided with his Moslem foes.
   Hrawi is also a Maronite, the Christian sect that has dominated
key government and military posts since independence from France in
1943.
   Aoun refuses to accept Hrawi as president because he was elected
under terms of the peace plan, which Aoun also rejects. His
opposition focuses on the failure of the plan to include a
timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

<HEAD>Mexican Cattle Head For U.S. Feed Lots To Escape Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Mexican cattle will be given fast-track
clearance to enter designated U.S. feed lots because
drought-shriveled pastures have been reduced to starvation levels,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the agency's usual import
regulations have been temporarily set aside so the cattle can be
brought in.
   Normally, he said, imported animals and their herds of origin
have to be tested and found free of cattle brucellosis and
tuberculosis.
   The usual requirement is that imported animals must come from
herds that have been tested for the diseases no less than three
months before the date of U.S. entry. With the special waiver, the
Mexican cattle will be able to enter approximately three months
sooner.
   ``The drought-stricken pasture lands in parts of Mexico cannot
support the cattle,'' Glosser said. ``By bringing the animals
temporarily to U.S. quarantined feed lots under strict movement
restrictions, we can avert starvation of the animals and still
protect the health of U.S. livestock.''
   Glosser said the cattle will be taken directly to quarantined
feed lots in USDA-sealed trucks or rail cars. They will not be sold
to any U.S. buyer and will return directly to Mexico from the feed
lots. The animals will be kept apart from U.S. cattle while in the
feed lots, which are mostly in Texas.
   All the cattle imported from Mexico still must be found free of
tuberculosis, and all except vaccinated cattle under 24 months of
age will need to test negative for brucellosis, Glosser said.
   There was no estimate of how many Mexican cattle may be imported
under the special program, said agency spokeswoman Anita Brown.

   All 21 residents of
Anatahan Island abandoned their homes and set livestock free as a
volcano that showed signs of erupting forced their evacuation.
   ``I really feel like I want to cry when we leave,'' Domi
Taisacan said. ``I just want to think about going back as fast as
we can. That's my home island.''
   Taisacan, 30, and the other island residents were flown 75 miles
south to Saipan on Tuesday aboard two U.S. Navy helicopters.
   In 1981, a volcano on Pagan Island, 195 miles north of Saipan,
forced the evacuation of 54 residents. They have never been allowed
to return because of the continuing eruption.
   ``How critical it is, we don't know,'' Gov. Larry I. Guerrero
said. ``But the critical thing is we don't want to be another Pagan
situation.''
   Guerrero must decide when the islanders can return home. The
island was hit by tremors last weekend as the unnamed volcano began
spewing steam-like sulfur gas.
   The bottom of the volcano's 500-foot wide crater looked like a
sulfur lake, said Joe Agulto, a Civil Defense official who few to
the island Sunday.
   ``It's really white, just like somebody is boiling water,''
Agulto said.
   Some of the islanders thought the evacuation unnecessary.
   ``It's nothing dramatic at all,'' Jess Wabol said. ``I know the
government here. They're very concerned about people's health.
That's why we came here.''
   Wobol said residents set livestock free because they didn't know
when they would return.

   Jurors in John M. Poindexter's Iran-Contra
coverup trial deliberated a third day Wednesday without a verdict
on charges that the former national security adviser lied to
lawmakers and obstructed Congress.
   The jury of eight women and four men sent no notes to U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene that would indicate how the
deliberations were proceeding.
   Poindexter, 53, a retired Navy rear admiral who was President
Reagan's national security adviser from late 1985 until he resigned
as the Iran-Contra affair unraveled in November 1986, is accused of
five felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing Congress and making
false statements.
   The indictment charges that Poindexter falsely assured Congress
the National Security Council was not covertly assisting the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels at a time when U.S. military aid had been
banned by Congress.
   Poindexter is also accused of lying by stating that he did not
learn of U.S. involvement in a 1985 shipment of Israeli Hawk
missiles to Iran until two months after it occurred.
   Prosecutors argued that Poindexter lied to conceal a politically
embarrassing presidential ``finding'' signed by Reagan that
authorized the arms deal as part of an effort to trade weapons for
American hostages.
   The judge, meanwhile, denied a defense request to clarify an
instruction he had given to the jury on Tuesday when it asked to
review more than 5,000 copies of electronic messages stored in
Poindexter's White House computer. Backup copies were found in the
White House computer system.
   The indictment charges that Poindexter deleted the messages from
his computer just days before he resigned.
   Greene told the jury it could not review them because the
messages, known as PROF notes, had not been admitted into evidence.
   In a court filing, Poindexter's lawyers urged Greene to clarify
this instruction, saying it ``may mislead the jury into believing
that it cannot base its decision upon other evidence'' about the
notes.
   The judge also denied the defense request that he tell the jury
that the PROF notes were not admitted into evidence because they
contained classified information.
   In a response, prosecutor Dan K. Webb said that Greene's remarks
Tuesday were sufficient but that he did not object to further
instructions ``out of an abundance of caution.''
   But the language Webb proposed for the additional instruction
contained no mention of the fact the notes were kept out of the
case because they contained classified information.
   The defense is trying to persuade jurors that Poindexter's
actions was just a normal security precaution to protect classified
documents.
   In his closing argument last Friday, defense attorney Richard
Beckler said Poindexter's deletions were ``the electronic
equivalent of clearing out his desk.''
   Prosecutors argued that at the time the files were deleted
Poindexter did not know that he would be resigning his job in the
wake of the Iran-Contra affair.

   President Bush lobbied for Senate passage of
an emergency aid package for Panama and Nicaragua this week, but
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell left the White House
Wednesday indicating that timetable won't be met.
   Bush invited more than a dozen senators to the White House to
congratulate them on Wednesday's passage of tougher clean air
standards.
   Afterward, he summoned Mitchell, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that dispenses foreign aid, into the Oval Office to
lobby for the Panama-Nicaragua package.
   Mitchell, who on Monday accused the administration of taking a
``jigsaw puzzle'' approach to foreign aid, told reporters,
``There's no point in worrying about something that we can't get to
until we deal with the authorization bill.''
   The authorization bill _ separate legislation that must first be
passed before Congress can appropriate, or actually disburse funds
_ ``isn't moving because Republican senators have so far been
unwilling to permit us to proceed without amendment and in a short
time limit,'' said Mitchell.
   ``We've gotten Democrats to agree, but Republicans have not
agreed'' to refrain from offering amendments, Mitchell said.
   ``We first want to see action on the authorization bill. All
else is speculation,'' said Mitchell. ``When we get action on the
authorization bill, then we'll consider the next step.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined comment on the
meeting, calling it private.
   Bush has been prodding the Senate to appropriate up to $800
million for Panama and Nicaragua before it leaves Thursday on an
Easter recess until April 18.
   The House voted for $720 million in aid to the countries
Tuesday. Panama is rebuilding following the U.S. invasion that
ended the Noriega dictatorship in December, and Nicaragua will end
Sandinista rule and install democratically elected Violeta Chamorro
as president April 25.
   Mitchell sent Secretary of State James A. Baker III a letter
Monday asking for a multi-year plan on how the United States should
spend its entire $14 billion in foreign aid.
   ``I didn't ask for a multi-year bill. I just asked for a plan
that would set forth the context in which this and other requests
will be considered and its relation to the overall budget,'' said
Mitchell.

<HEAD>Khashoggi Portrayed as Naive Businessman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi was portrayed by
his lawyer Wednesday as a naive businessman who was taken in by a
deal involving a shipload of gold proposed by former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   In his opening arguments at the fraud trial of Khashoggi and
Imelda Marcos, attorney James Lynn said his client had committed
``foolish acts'' in his business dealings but didn't commit any
crimes.
   He used the never-realized gold deal to explain why Khashoggi
made frequent trips and phone calls to the deposed Philippines
leader's home in exile in Hawaii.
   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of
justice for allegedly helping the Marcoses hide their ownership in
Manhattan real estate after the Philippine government won a U.S.
court order in March 1986 to prohibit any further transactions
involving the properties.
   Linn conceded that Khashoggi had many personal dealings with the
late Marcos and that Khashoggi had signed one fake document
involving the buildings, but said this was intended to help a
Marcos associate, not to defraud anyone.
   Khashoggi, once described as the richest man in the world, was
trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose on the
properties, Linn said.
   Marcos had offered Khashoggi 10 percent of a shipload of gold if
Khashoggi could find a safe port for the vessel, preferably in an
Arab country, Linn said. Marcos later told Khashoggi he had made
other arrangements for the gold, he said.
   Prosecutors say Khashoggi had been in contact with Marcos to
discuss faking documents to show that he, not the Marcoses, had
actually owned four Manhattan buildings allegedly bought with more
than $160 million stolen from the Philippines treasury.
   Linn said Khashoggi was innocent of the charges and had merely
shown poor judgment in his dealings with the Marcoses.
   ``If this wasn't such a serious charge, this would be funny,''
he said. ``It is not the sinister thing that the government makes
it out'' to be.
   Linn said he would call a handwriting expert to testify that
Khashoggi's initials were forged on other documents.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, has pleaded innocent to charges of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice. If convicted, she faces up to 50 years in prison and $1
million in fines. Khashoggi faces up to 10 years in prison and
$500,000 in fines if convicted.
   The prosecution's first witness, a former real estate broker
with Sotheby's auction house, testified about an art collection
that Marcoses allegedly bought with the embezzled funds.
   Thomas Bryan, of Fairfax, Va., said the collection of paintings,
furniture and antiques had been housed in the Manhattan apartment
of art collector Leslie Samuels, who hired Sotheby's to sell both
the cooperative apartment and its contents after his wife passed
away.
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella,
Bryan said Mrs. Marcos first saw the collection in 1981 on a tour
of the apartment with Gliceria Tantoco, a Marcos associate who
owned a Philippine department store.
   Mrs. Tantoco and her husband, who had been the Philippine
ambassador to the Vatican, fled after being charged with the
Marcoses.
   Samuels personally showed them around the apartment and later
invited them to dinner at his new residence at the Waldorf Towers,
where Mrs. Marcos also was staying, Bryan testified.
   Later that evening, after the party had moved to Mrs. Marcos'
rooms for entertainment, Bryan said Mrs. Tantoco approached him and
said, ``We are very interested in purchasing the contents and the
apartment itself.''
   They negotiated a deal with Samuels and agreed on a tentative
price of $8 million for the apartment and just under $6 million for
the art collection, he said.
   At a later meeting, Bryan said he told Mrs. Tantoco and Mrs.
Marcos that the apartment could not be bought by a corporation but
only by an individual who was to be the principal user. After the
two women held a brief discussion, he said Mrs. Tantoco asked if he
would be willing to put his name on the contract.
   ``I said it was not possible due to my current financial
situation and salary and because the board would have a hard time
understanding how I came up with the money,'' Bryan said, prompting
laughter. He said his salary at the time was $27,000 a year.
   Bryan said the art collection was purchased by a corporation,
but the apartment fell through because Mrs. Tantoco was rejected as
a buyer by the cooperative's board.
   When he expressed his regret to Mrs. Marcos about the board's
denial, Bryan testified, she told him ``she had purchased another
piece of real estate that day, the Genesco Building.'' That
building, now called the Crown Building, is one of the four
properties named in the indictment.

<HEAD>Corporate America, Environmentalists Clash at Exhibits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exhibits stretched more than a block in
two large white tents on the National Mall as corporate America put
its best environmental face on display Wednesday.
   But some environmentalists weren't impressed, and members of
Greenpeace were escorted from one of the tents after several
handcuffed themselves to a support poll near the Du Pont Chemical
Co. exhibit.
   The U.S. Park Police said 19 Greenpeace members were arrested
and charged with demonstrating without a permit.
   The organizers of ``Earth Tech'' said more than 100 companies
brought exhibits to the five-day environmental technology fair
being held as part of the numerous activities marking Earth Day,
April 22.
   The exhibit and a series of technology forums, designed to
attract members of Congress and other government officials, were
estimated to cost about $1 million with participating companies
paying most of the bill.
   The participants included Fortune 500 companies such as Du Pont
and AT&amp;T but also some unknowns such as Oil Stop Inc., which says
it has invented a new type of boom to capture oil spills _ the
``self-energizing oil containment system.''
   It's so compact, says company official Richard Lazes, that a
5,000-foot spool could be put on a tanker and unwound within
minutes. That much boom ``would have surrounded'' the Exxon Valdez,
he says.
   While several oil companies ``are excited about it, they've made
no commitment yet,'' he said.
   Producers of solar, thermal and wind-generated energy were
especially prominent, as were companies in the rapidly growing
industry of waste management and disposal _ and, of course,
recycling.
   The nature of many of the businesses, as well as their
environmental track record, brought criticism from
environmentalists. Several conservation groups also put up exhibits
including the Wilderness Society and the Izaak Walton League.
   Workmen near some of the exhibits were still putting up banners
including a huge one proclaiming ``Aluminum Recycling: America's
Environmental Success Story'' when across the street members of
Greenpeace denounced the industry effort.
   ``Corporate America has begun a campaign to paint themselves
green,'' said Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace USA.
A nearby banner read, ``Don't Be Fooled _ Industry Greenwash.''
   Later several of the Greenpeace members entered one of the
exhibit tent, handcuffed themselves a support poll and were cut
loose by security officers and escorted away.
   At the Du Pont exhibit, displays touted the company's efforts to
push for plastic recycling.
   A dummy _ Mr. R.E. Cycle _ made of recycled beverage, milk and
detergent bottles sat on a wood-like bench made of recycled
plastics. Du Pont officials also talked of their efforts to develop
substitutes for CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, which are damaging
the stratospheric ozone layer.
   Greenpeace has been among the environmental groups that have
criticized Du Pont and others for not pushing for a replacement of
CFCs earlier and charge the company is only doing so now because
the government will ban CFCs anyway.
   Fair organizers maintained that many of the exhibits demonstrate
the interest of businesses both large and small to push for
environmental improvements.
   ``I don't think that you can make anything these days without
using energy or polluting the environment. The question is how
much,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., co-chairman of the fair's
organizing committee.
   Among the exhibits were those that approached the exotic: a
solar-powered car that had traveled across the country; a model of
a ``wind plant'' to show that wind power already is generating
millions of kilowatts of power in parts of California; and the
$18-electric bulb that lasts seven years, won't break and uses
one-fourth less energy than a conventional bulb.
   ``That's equivalent to not burning 400 pounds of coal over the
life of the bulb,'' said Steve Waxman of Philips Lighting Co. The
``Earth Light'' isn't available in hardware stores yet but may soon
be, he said.

   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said Wednesday that the Soviet Union eventually may agree
that a unified Germany should be in NATO.
   Genscher said at a news conference after meeting with President
Bush that he expected international agreement would be completed on
German unification this year and that the first elections in a
unified state could take place next year.
   He said he expected the Soviets would raise their opposition to
unified Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization when East and West Germany meet with the four major
World War II victors in coming weeks.
   But, Genscher said, ``it is my belief that the opinions in the
Soviet Union (about NATO membership) have not been finalized'' and
that the Soviets could be persuaded that it will serve their
security interests to have a unified Germany in NATO.
   The Western allies are convinced it will make Europe more stable
to have Germany in NATO and that a neutral Germany would create
uncertainty and lead to instability, he said.
   ``Also, countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary will
have an influence on the forming of the Soviet opinion in this
respect,'' he said. ``The Soviet Union will ... (see) how this can
preserve their own security.''
   Genscher said the two German governments were determined that
unity would threaten no other country and that ``the legitimate
security interest of the Soviet Union will be taken into
consideration to the fullest.''
   He reiterated his support for developing a security framework
for all of Europe, the United States and Canada by working through
the process built on the 1975 Helsinki accords of 35 nations
pledging themselves to security and cooperation in Europe.
   But Genscher said the German support for such a framework did
not undermine Germany's commitment to NATO.
   ``The Western alliance will not be in any way abandoned,'' he
said. ``There is no doubt that the alliance will last a long time.''
   Genscher said the Europe Economic Community also would play a
major role in fostering stability for the region.
   ``We are more and more convinced that the European Community
will become more and more an anchor of stability in Europe,'' he
said, adding that Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria,
Romania and even the Soviet Union want the closest possible ties to
the community and that some even want to become members.
   Bonn and Washington are ``in complete agreement'' on all the
basic issues, he said.
   One area of difference between the two governments has been over
U.S. insistence that West German-based short-range Lance nuclear
missiles be modernized. The West Germans say the weapons are
pointless because they can only hit Eastern Europe, which no longer
poses a threat to the West.
   Genscher said the Lance didn't come up in his talks.
   Genscher, asked whether Soviet reaction to moves for
independence by Lithuania would affect German unification, said,
``We hope that through responsible actions of all parties involved,
we will get a responsible solution.''

   Showers produced locally heavy rain over the Northeast during
the night and into the day Wednesday, triggering flood watches in
Maine and New York state. Heavy snow fell in New York state.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. EDT
included 2.91 inches at Boston; 2.69 inches at Portsmouth, N.H.;
2.50 inches at Providence, R.I.; 2.17 inches at Hartford, Conn.;
2.05 inches at Albany, N.Y.; and 2.05 inches at Portland, Maine.
   By afternoon, showers extended across much of the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast region.
   Flood watches were issued for streams and small rivers across
much of Maine and for the St. Lawrence Valley and Lake Placid
region of eastern New York state.
   The heavy overnight snow in parts of New York state left up to 6
inches in Steuben County in the western part of the state. Snow
continued over some areas during the afternoon.
   Strong, gusty wind accompanied the rain and snow in the
Northeast. Gale warnings were posted along the coast of Maine and
New Hampshire.
   A cold front crossing the middle Mississippi Valley and the
central Plains produced showers near southern Lake Michigan and
over the central High Plains.
   Another cold front crossing the Canadian border brought arctic
air into the north-central states.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 30s from the central
Appalachians to the lower Great Lakes, and across northern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   An upper-level weather disturbance off the southern Pacific
Coast spread a few showers into southwestern California.
   Temperatures rose into the 70s across much of Oklahoma, Texas,
Arkansas and Louisiana, and across southern Florida, and into the
70s and 80s in southern Arizona.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.

   The archbishop of Guatemala asked
authorities Wednesday to ban two films about the sexy dance lambada
because they might ``incite young people to sin.''
   ``The music isn't bad but the way of dancing is,'' said
Monsignor Prospero Penados del Barrio. ``It's a sexual sport.''
   ``Lambada'' and ``Lambada: The Forbidden Dance,'' two films
about the popular Brazilian dance, have been playing to packed
movie houses since opening last week in eight theaters.
   The prelate issued the public call to the Ministry of Culture
and Sports, which has rated the films for audiences over 15.
   The archbishop said lambada ``is in very bad taste because it
excites the basest passions.''
   He also told Roman Catholics nationwide to boycott the movies.

   The doctor treating Lee Atwater for a brain
tumor said Wednesday the growth is ``aggressive and dangerous,''
and will require chemotherapy in addition to radiation treatment.
   In a statement issued through the Republican Party headquarters,
Dr. Paul L. Kornblith said that working in Atwater's favor were the
facts that he was in excellent health and ``the lesion is quite
small and has been detected early in its development.''
   Atwater was in Montefiore Medical Center in New York City where
a team of physicians led by Kornblith implanted radioactive
isotopes into the tumor Tuesday in an effort to kill the growth on
the right frontal lobe of Atwater's brain.
   ``The procedure took approximately four hours and was
uneventful,'' said Kornblith. He added that it was completed
``without apparent impairment'' to any neurological functions.
   ``Although it is obvious that this tumor is aggressive and
dangerous, Mr. Atwater has many factors working in his favor,''
Kornblith said.
   A party official said the 39-year-old Atwater was receiving
numerous visitors in a New York hospital Wednesday, though they had
to stand behind a lead shield because of radioactivity.
   Party chief of staff Mary Matalin said the radioactive device
would be removed on Friday, and that recuperation was expected to
take several weeks.
   Atwater's wife, Sally, who is expecting to deliver the couple's
third child on Monday, was in New York with him.
   Kornblith said the growth, known as a astrocytoma, was the most
common primary brain tumor.
   ``It does not spread to other parts of the body but can cause
damage to brain tissue by pressure and by invasion,'' the doctor
said.
   A brain tumor undergoing unrestrained growth would cause
pressure within the closed skull. This pressure would kill normal
brain cells, thus bringing eventual death by destroying vital
functions.
   Brain tumors can also spread by extension into other parts of
the central nervous system and displace normal cells. During such a
process, there would be a progressive loss of function as normal
brain cells associated with memory, thought, muscle control and
even heart beat and respiration are lost.
   Kornblith said that ``in order to assure that any tumor cells
peripheral to the main lesion are destroyed, he will be receiving
chemotherapy as well.
   ``This particular form of chemotherapy is given orally once
every six weeks and will not limit his activities or functions.''
   The doctor said Atwater will be able to be discharged from the
hospital in a few days ``and may well be able to return to work in
some degree within a couple of weeks.
   ``He will need to be followed closely and may need to have
additional therapies in the future. For the present we are
delighted with his progress.''

   The Hard Rock Cafe, a watering
hole for the hip and famous, was flooded with 200,000 gallons of
water early Wednesday when a film crew truck hit a hydrant.
   The water warped the Hard Rock's hardwood floor, but
firefighters were able to save such rock 'n' roll momentos as Elton
John's sequined baseball uniform, Steven Tyler's leopard jump suit
and an entire wall of Elvis memorabilia.
   Firefighters and employees used water vacuum trucks, mops and
squeegees to clean up the Hard Rock in time for dinner, said
Valerie Van Galder, a spokeswoman for the rock 'n' roll-themed club.
   The truck struck a fire hydrant at 3:47 a.m. and water shot up
to the Hard Rock's roof. The water leaked into the restaurant,
covering the floor with up to 8 inches of water, said city Fire
Department spokesman Pat Marek.
   No injuries were reported.
   The truck that hit the hydrant was part of a camera crew taping
an all-night TV special commemorating Earth Day called ``Hard Rock
Cafe Presents Save the Planet.'' The show will air April 20 on CBS.
   Taking part in the taping were music stars MC Hammer, The Red
Hot Chili Peppers and Taylor Dane, actress Katey Sagal of ``Married
... With Children'' and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister told a session of
Arab ministers Wednesday that Iraq will destroy its chemical
weapons if Israel did the same and signed the 1968 nuclear
non-proliferation treaty, an official said.
   The Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonmymity, said
Tareq Aziz of Iraq made the offer when he met behind closed doors
with other foreign ministers of the Arab Cooperation Council. The
Egyptian attended the talks.
   The organization, formed in February 1989, has Iraq, Egypt,
Jordan and North Yemen as its members.
   Earlier, Aziz reiterated accusations that Israel is preparing to
attack Iraq and other Arab countries.
   His comments came after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
declared Baghdad has binary chemical weapons and will use them
against Israel if attacked.
   Saddam's disclosure Monday followed arrests in London last week
of people accused of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to
Iraq. Baghdad denied it is trying to build a nuclear bomb.
   The London incident occurred during international clamor over
the March 15 execution of a London-based journalist on spying
charges.
   ``Israel's motive in this anti-Iraq campaign is to harm the
reputation of Iraq, terrorize us, besiege Baghdad and then prepare
to launch an attack on us and other Arab nations,'' Aziz said.
   Aziz arrived in Amman in response to a call by Jordan to hold an
emergency meeting of council foreign ministers to discuss a
possible Israeli assault on Iraq.
   The Egyptian official said Aziz told the ministers Iraq was
willing ``to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons, acquired for
purely defensive purposes, if Israel does the same and like Iraq
agrees to sign'' the non-proliferation treaty.
   The Egyptian said Jordan, North Yemen and Egypt ``welcomed the
Iraqi proposal.''
   Iraq has signed the 1968 treaty. Israel, believed to be the
Middle East's only nuclear military power, has not.
   The official said Iraq also called for an emergency meeting of
foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League to discuss ``the
details of the tricky game.''
   Meeting with Aziz were foreign ministers Marwan Kassem of
Jordan, Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt and Abdel-Karim al-Eryani of
North Yemen.
   In Kuwait, the daily Al-Anbaa reported Wednesday that
Palestinian leader Salah Khalaf appealed to Iran to make peace with
Iraq to help the Arabs confront a possible Israeli attack. Khalaf
is right-hand man to Yasser Arafat in the mainstream Fatah faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<HEAD>Bill Would Give Bush Chance to Remove AIDS from Entry Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill introduced in Congress on Wednesday
would give the Bush administration an opportunity to remove AIDS
from a list of contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from
entering the United States.
   The bill was sponsored by Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., on behalf
of the National Commission on AIDS. The administration's position
on the bill was not clear.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control recently recommended
that AIDS be stricken from the list, along with several other
diseases. That recommendation is under review by the Department of
Health and Human Services, but officials say the department lacks
authority to remove it.
   The bill would give HHS explicit authority over the list,
sponsors said.
   The entry restrictions have prompted dozens of international
organizations and agencies to call for a boycott of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco in June. France
and Switzerland also have said they won't send official delegations
to the meeting.
   ``It seems such a compelling thing,'' said Dr. June Osborn,
chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS, whose members were
appointed by Congress and the White House.
   ``The U.S. is being looked at with such astonishing horror'' by
officials and organizations in other countries, she said.
   Under a law passed in 1987 by Congress, infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, was added to the
list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can be barred from
entering the country.
   Administration officials have said they do not have the
authority to eliminate the restriction and have done all they can
within the limits of their power, including expediting waivers for
those who want to attend the conference. But they have said that
since Congress directed that AIDS be put on the list, congressional
action would be required to remove it.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., one of the co-sponsors of the bill,
said that while he believes the administration already has the
authority to act, the legislation would make that authority
``absolutely clear.''
   The measure would give the HHS secretary authority to decide
which diseases pose a threat to the public health and would require
exclusion from the country. It does not mention HIV or AIDS.
   ``We should let health officials make the health decisions,''
Waxman said. ``That is what we did before 1987 and that is what we
should continue to do.''

<TEXT>
   Ceremonies took place in the Scottish
town of Lockerbie on Wednesday to send two schoolgirls to Syracuse
University on scholarships created as a memorial for the victims of
Pan Am Flight 103.
   Fiona Griffin and Katharine Grant, both 16, will spend nine
months at the New York university that lost 35 students in the
bombing of the Boeing 747 airliner in December 1988.
   All 259 people aboard the New York-bound Maid of the Seas and 11
people on the ground were killed.
   The ceremony setting up the scholarship was signed at Lockerbie
Academy by two academy teachers and local councilmen who are
trustees of the air disaster fund.
   Students from the Lockerbie area of southern Scotland who meet
university entrance qualifications will compete annually for the
double scholarship., which is managed by the Lockerbie and Syracuse
University Trust.
   The scholarship is funded jointly by the university and the
disaster fund.
   Among those present at Wednesday's ceremony were two members of
the Syracuse University staff, Margaret Himley of the English
department and Peter Mollar of the school of communications, both
teaching at the university's London center.
   Rector Drew Blake of Lockerbie Academy presented the two girls
with scrolls and said, ``Any memorial from a young person's
viewpoint should be living and ongoing, and that is what the
scholarship will be.''
   ``I am very proud of the two girls who have been chosen. Apart
from gaining experience that they will cherish for the rest of
their lives, they will be acting as our ambassadors,'' he said.
   Fiona and Katharine were among 14 pupils who competed for the
scholarships. They had to write essays on why they wanted to go to
Syracuse University and were selected by education staff of the
Dumfries and Galloway district and representatives of the
university.
   The girls will go to Syracuse in August.
   Fiona is a Sunday school teacher and school prefect who hopes to
study law, while Katharine is a music and drama buff who wants to
be a doctor.

   The Soviet Union, shuffling the top level of
its foreign service, is expected to send a new ambassador to
Washington in time for the June summit meeting betweem President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, administration
officials said Wednesday.
   Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh would replace Yuri V. Dubinin, who has
headed the Soviet Embassy here since 1986.
   Dubinin is slated to become the new Soviet ambassador to France,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bessmertnykh, an urbane, experienced and well-traveled
56-year-old expert on the United States, Canada and the Middle
East, is the first deputy foreign minister.
   Dubinin, 59, who came to Washington fluent in Spanish and
French, swiftly developed facility in English and oversaw the
opening of the Embassy to news conferences and other sessions with
diplomats and reporters under the glasnost, or openness, policy of
Gorbachev.
   The wavy-haired, smiling envoy was a self-described
``popularizer of perestroika,'' the Gorbachev program for
restructuring the Soviet economy. But he could also take on
assignments with a hard edge.
   As the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Dubinin in 1986
blasted the Reagan administration's slashing of the Soviet staff
there from 275 to 170 as ``large-scale political sabotage.''
   Bessmertnykh, an arms control specialist and a graduate of the
Moscow State Institute of International Relations, is considered
particularly close to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, who began three days of talks Wednesday with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A specific date for the Bush-Gorbachev summit, to be held in
Washington, is expected to be decided upon during Shevardnadze's
visit.
   Bessmertnykh, who confers regularly in Moscow with U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr., accompanied Shevardnadze to
Washington for the talks, which will culminate Friday with a
meeting with Bush at the White House.
   His prospective reassignment as the Soviet ambassador to
Washington is part of a revamping of the principal overseas
assignments in the Soviet foreign service. It is not considered a
reflection on Dubinin, who succeeded longtime Soviet ambassador
Anatoly F. Dobrynin. Both envoys were known for their affability.
   Dubinin, who entered the Soviet foreign service in 1965,
evidently was not accorded the special status by the Reagan and
Bush administrations that Dobrynin enjoyed in the Nixon years.
   Dobrynin was used by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, also
the national security adviser, during the detente era of the 1970s
as a special channel to the Kremlin.
   Bessmertnykh, who served here from 1970 to 1983, is responsible
in the foreign ministry for Canada and the Middle East as well as
for U.S. affairs. He was named chief of the foreign ministry's
U.S.A. department in 1983 and was elevated to the post of first
deputy foreign minister in October 1988.

<HEAD>Chad Claims Libyan-Backed Enemy Destroyed at Two Outposts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad's army said Wednesday night that it
had retaken two eastern outposts in battles with Libyan-backed
Islamic Legion forces that left more than 300 invaders dead.
   ``The Sudano-Islamic forces were totally destroyed on this day,
and the rare survivors have fled in the direction of their Sudanese
lair,'' the Armed Forces High Command said in a statement over
state Radio Chad.
   Trucks with loudspeakers rolled through the capital calling on
Chadians to assemble Thursday to ``condemn the Libyan aggression.''
   The Islamic Legion has been attacking Chad from Sudan's Darfur
province, an area over which the Sudanese government exercises
virtually no control.
   The radio played military music following an initial
announcement that Bahai and Tine had been retaken in fighting that
left 330 enemy dead and captured 46 prisoners.
   It did not give government casualty figures, but the High
Command statement announcing total victory said a complete count
would be announced later.
   Radio Chad stressed Libya's role in backing the Islamic Legion,
reportedly headed by Idress Deby, a former commander-in-chief of
the government forces. Libya denies backing the Islamic Legion.
   Libya ``is at the origin, the very center, of this new center of
tension in eastern Chad,'' the radio said. ``Libya is waging a
direct war against Chad. Its objectives remain the same. Only the
strategy has changed this time.''
   The government of President Hissene Habre reported attacks on
Bahai and Tine last week, the latest in sporadic Islamic Legion
assaults since Chad and Libya announced a cease-fire.
   Since becoming independent in 1960, Chad has often been torn by
fighting between north and south, between different tribes and
political factions and between Libyan-backed rebels and government
forces.
   In August, Chad and Libya agreed to put an end to 16 years of
hostility and to reach a political settlement over the
45,000-square-mile Aouzou Strip that separates them.

<HEAD>Government Introduces Citizenship Bill for Hong Kong Chinese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday formally introduced
its controversial bill that would grant British citizenship to an
estimated 225,000 Hong Kong Chinese.
   It faces stiff opposition and possible defeat by a rare union of
the socialist Labor Party, which considers the bill elitist, and
right-wing legislators in the governing Conservative Party opposed
to mass immigration.
   The bill was presented to Parliament hours after Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said Britain had a ``solemn duty'' to the colony
before it reverts to China in 1997.
   Thatcher said that giving key people a safety outlet was
essential to prevent a crippling brain drain over the next seven
years and ``to keep the prosperity going'' in Hong Kong.
   But former Conservative Party Chairman Norman Tebbit said as
many as 80 right-wing Tories have threatened a revolt against the
government.
   The Labor Party's leadership on Wednesday night voted
unanimously to oppose the bill. Deputy leader Roy Hattersley said
it granted citizenship on the basis of ``wealth, power and
influence'' and would not achieve its objective of keeping key
people in Hong Kong.
   Hong Kong is subject to British rule under a 99-year lease with
China signed in 1898. Hong Kong will revert to Chinese control on
July 1, 1997, under terms of a joint declaration signed by Britain
and China in 1984.
   The British Nationality, or Hong Kong, Bill allows the Home
Secretary to grant citizenship ``before June 30, 1997, up to 50,000
Hong Kong residents recommended by the governor of Hong Kong under
a selection scheme to be approved by Parliament.''
   Citizenship also will be granted to the spouses and young
children of the key residents. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has
estimated this will bring the total to 225,000 people.
   Under the bill, Hong Kong governor Sir David Wilson will appoint
a committee to advise him on the citizenship issue. Most of the
50,000 will be chosen on a ``points system.''
   The measure was given a formal first reading in the House of
Commons but the first major test will come in the second reading on
April 19.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said he was confident the bill
would be adopted.
   ``I am sure we will persuade enough Members of Parliament to
carry the measure,'' Waddington told Channel 4 TV News.
   But Conservative opponents already were gearing for battle.
   ``The government are about to do something which I never thought
I would live to see _ legalizing an activity which was criminal,
namely creating a market in passports,'' said Robert Adley,
chairman of the British-Chinese Parliamentary Group.
   ``The employment market will be distorted by jobs to which
British passports are attached. This scheme is going from the
bizarre to the bazaar,'' Adley said.
   In 1989, 42,000 people left Hong Kong and 55,000 are expected to
leave in 1990, he said.
   About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese now have British passports,
but no residence rights.

<HEAD>Novello Says Localities Must Decide on AIDS Education for Teens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General Antonia Novello said Wednesday
it is important that adolescents be taught about AIDS, but
communities must decide for themselves how to do that.
   ``What is good for Iowa might not be good for New York,'' she
said. ``You always have to take into consideration ... the state
where they live, what is the morality of that particular community
and what is the incidence (of AIDS) in that community.''
   She said that while some parents object to AIDS education
because they feel their children are not at risk, ``at least some
education has to be going on.''
   ``You ... at least have (to have) the data out there,'' she
said, ``but you have to make sure it's done with sensitivity.''
   ``And in the cases in which monogamy and abstention doesn't
work, then the adolescent should know that the condom, in the
absence of a vaccine, might be the most common available form of
prevention.''
   Novello also said an educational AIDS brochure discussing condom
use, a project begun more than two years ago at the Department of
Health and Human Services, will be released soon. Critics had
charged that conservatives in the department were trying to derail
the publication because it discussed condoms.
   Jim Brown, a spokesman for the surgeon general, said the
pamphlet has been reviewed by all levels at the department and is
on its way to the printer.
   Novello, a pediatrician and the first woman and Hispanic to
become surgeon general, met with reporters and answered questions
on a range of public health issues. On many issues, though, she
said she has not formed an opinion, since she has been on the job
only about a month.
   On questions about abortion, she toed the Bush administration
line, saying it should not be allowed except in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the life of the mother.
   She also stood by the Department of Health and Human Services'
ban on federal funding of fetal tissue transplantation research,
saying that such research could increase the incidence of abortion.
   She said she will add her voice to that of HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan in campaigning against smoking. She said she does not
favor banning tobacco advertising because ``advertising is
freedom.'' Rather, the industry's ads need to be countered with
prevention messages, she said.
   Novello said she also is worried that women ``might get too
complacent'' about the risk of AIDS, since far fewer women have
acquired the disease than men.
   From June 1981 through February, 12,370 cases of AIDS in females
have been reported, compared with 112,614 cases in men, according
to the Centers for Disease Control.

   Police have detained 269 religious
extremists in connection with attacks on Coptic Christians in
southern Egypt, Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa said in
Thursday's editions of a newspaper.
   The total arrested was 53 more than Moussa announced 10 days ago
to parliament. The minister had said 216 Moslems and Coptics were
detained after the anti-Christian attacks last month in el-Minya
province.
   In an interview in the Cairo daily Al-Gomhouria, Moussa said the
53 suspects were detained for plotting new sectarian troubles.
   Moussa gave no details but said the new arrests brought to more
than 700 the number of people in preventive custody under an
emergency law enacted after Moslem extremists assassinated
President Anwar Sadat Oct. 6, 1981.
   Moslem extremists stoned and set fire to two churches and a
youth club in the el-Minya province. Three apartment buildings, a
candy factory and several Christian-owned shops were gutted by
fire. Fifteen people were injured.
   The government said the riots were triggered by a rumor that the
son of the candy factory owner, a Copt, had taken obscene
photographs of a Moslem teen-age girl after drugging her.

   Three Israeli helicopter gunships blasted a
Palestinian guerrilla office in the south Lebanon refugee camp of
Rashidiyeh on Wednesday, and seven people were wounded, police
reported.
   They said the gunships, flying low over the Mediterranean, fired
four missiles into the office used by the Palestinian Communist
Party at 3:50 p.m. The building was severely damaged.
   Guerrillas fired at the gunships with twin-barreled
anti-aircraft guns. No hits were observed.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said air force planes
attacked a guerrilla base near Tyre in south Lebanon on Wednesday,
hit their targets and returned safely. The statement gave no
details. No immediate explanation was available why Israel
identified the raiders as planes and Lebanese police identified
them as helicopter gunships.
   A guerrilla spokesman, who refused to be identified, told
reporters in Rashidiyeh the missiles slightly damaged 10 refugee
shacks around the office.
   He said two of the wounded were guerrillas and the rest were
civilians.
   Rashidiyeh, 12 miles north of the Israeli border, houses 18,530
refugees registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.
   It was the ninth Israeli air attack on targets in Lebanon this
year.
   By police count, 10 people were killed and 22 wounded in the
earlier air strikes.
   The last was directed against a base used by the Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in
north Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   The Red Cross said Wednesday it has
resumed relief flights to two main towns in war-torn southern Sudan.
   Pierre Andre Conod, Khartoum representative of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said two planes carried medicine,
medical equipment and personnel to Wau, capital of the Bahr
el-Ghazal region, and Malakal, capital of the Upper Nile province,
on Monday and Tuesday.
   Relief flights to south Sudan were suspended last year after
fighting resumed between the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   Christian and animist rebels in the south have waged a
7-year-old war for autonomy from the Moslem-dominated government in
Khartoum. The war created a famine estimated to have killed 300,000
southerners in 1988.
   The United Nations says 4{ million southerners need emergency
relief assistance this summer. About 2.3 million live in the
war-torn areas in southern Sudan, 400,000 others fled to border
areas and about 1.8 million displaced people have gone to Khartoum.
   Conod said relief flights will continue until April 16. After
that, he said, a U.S-made Hercules C130 transport plane will
transport seeds and agricultural equipment to Wau before the
beginning of the rainy season.
   The ICRC is also planning to transport meningitis vaccine to Wau
in cooperation with the Sudanese health ministry, Conod said.

<HEAD>FAA: Pan Am Security Lapses Continued Eight Months After Flight
103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am took more than eight months to correct
serious security lapses at West Germany's Frankfurt airport after
the bombing of Flight 103, top federal aviation officials testified
Wednesday.
   The chairwoman of a presidential commission looking into the
December 1988 bombing that killed 270 people at Lockerbie,
Scotland, sharply criticized the Federal Aviation Administration
for allowing the problems to persist for so long.
   ``I've never seen anything like this in my life,'' chairwoman
Ann McLaughlin told FAA Administrator James Busey, who said part of
the problem was that the FAA was leaderless during part of the
period after the bombing. Busey took office in July.
   Ms. McLaughlin said that was an ``absolutely unacceptable''
excuse for failure to get Pan Am to correct problems at Frankfurt
where the bomb may have been placed aboard the flight. The FAA is
responsible for overseeing security of U.S. airlines in the United
States and abroad.
   Pan American World Airways Chairman Thomas Plaskett, who also
testified at the commission hearing, said the airline followed
inspection procedures approved by the FAA. The airline is
contesting $630,000 in fines levied by the FAA last September for
security lapses related to Flight 103 and five other European
flights around the same time.
   The latest allegations, however, have never been the subject of
fines.
   FAA security chief Ray Salazar and Associate Administrator Monte
Belger testified that Frankfurt inspections after the bombing
revealed security problems that weren't corrected until September
1989.
   Salazar denied sworn statements in depositions by Pan Am
officials that he gave them permission to X-ray checked luggage as
an alternative to requirements that it be matched to passengers at
Frankfurt.
   Investigators believe a bag was loaded at Frankfurt containing
the bomb that blew up the airliner after the flight changed planes
in London.
   Belger said he was ``extremely frustrated'' by repeated
inspections at Frankfurt that continued to show uncorrected
problems in checking personnel who service Pan Am airliners and
other lapses.
   But he said that after top FAA and Pan AM officials met in
August and sent a team to Frankfurt, the airline's security at the
airport became ``a model for the industry.''
   Paul Hudson, head of one of two victims' relatives
organizations, said the FAA and Pan Am disclosures at Wednesday's
hearing confirmed family members' deepest concerns about the
airlines' security.
   ``My daughter had no chance at all,'' Hudson said in an
interview outside the hearing room after Pan Am's top official
testified that luggage at Frankfurt was not hand-searched and that
no special procedures were used following threats against Pan Am
flights to the United States.
   James Weidener, commission executive director, read a memo from
an FAA inspector following a visit to Frankfurt last June which
said security was ``totally unsatisfactory.''
   ``All passengers flying out of Frankfurt by Pan Am are at great
risk,'' the internal FAA letter said six months after the bombing.
   Weidener did not identify the FAA inspector or the two Pan Am
official he said testified under oath this week that Salazar had
given the airline permission prior to the bombing of Flight 103 to
take less-stringent security measures at Frankfurt.
   The seven-member commission, including four members of Congress,
is completing an inquiry into measures that might be taken to
prevent terrorist attacks on U.S. aviation and to deal with them if
they occur. The panel is to report to President Bush in mid-May.

<HEAD>Study Shows Acyclovir Helpful in Chickenpox Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study shows that the drug widely used
to treat genital herpes is effective in treating chickenpox in
children, but one doctor cautions that its side effects should be
weighed heavily.
   According to a report in this month's Journal of Pediatrics,
acyclovir reduced the number of itchy blisters and shortened by a
day the normal five-day course of chickenpox in 50 Twin Cities
children who received the drug in pioneering trials.
   But Dr. John F. Modlin of Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore said he was worried that rare and toxic
reactions to the drug would become widespread in chickenpox
patients. The reactions include kidney failure and neurological
disorders such as slurred speech, disorientation and seizures.
   ``I want to stress all in all that acyclovir is a very safe
drug,'' Modlin said. ``It's a good drug and largely non-toxic. But
when you give it to thousands of children there will be some who
develop unusual toxicities.
   ``The most important question that has to be asked is, `How
important is it to treat chickenpox in otherwise healthy children
with a drug?'''
   Dr. Henry Balfour, the pediatrician who headed the University of
Minnesota study, said the study found no serious side effects and
he predicts eventual widespread use of the drug, which is also used
to treat genital herpes.
   Balfour said there is ``room for dialogue'' about the treatment,
but he said ``the burden is on the skeptics'' to prove whether
risks outweigh benefits.
   ``We don't know about rare side effects, and that is true,''
Balfour said. ``But what there is to lose is definitely less than
what there is to gain.''
   He said doctors shouldn't wait for Federal Drug Administration
approval of acyclovir's specific application for chickenpox.
Because acyclovir already has FDA approval as an antiviral drug,
doctors are free to use it as a chickenpox treatment based on
research.
   The drug's effectiveness in shortening the normal duration of
chickenpox is important because most complications develop near the
end of a typical five-day infection, Balfour said.
   About 4,000 American children are hospitalized each year from
complications of the disease, which can range from skin or ear
infections to pneumonia or brain infections, Balfour said. About
100 to 200 die from the disease each year, according to data from
the Centers for Disease Control.
   ``You can't tell at the outset which child is going to be the
one of every 4,000 that get hospitalized,'' Balfour said. ``I'm
more over on the extreme that you should treat all the children.''
   He said some doctors may delay prescribing acyclovir until
results of a larger, 10-city study are released, probably later
this year. Other doctors may limit the use of acyclovir to
youngsters 11 and older, who tend to have the most severe cases of
chickenpox, Balfour said.
   The study, sponsored in part by Burroughs Wellcome Co.,
manufacturer of acyclovir, was carried out from February through
June 1987. Testing for immunity and analysis took two years.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama lashed out at its Latin
American neighbors on Wednesday, accusing them of ``flagrant
intervention'' in calling for new presidential elections.
   Seven countries told Panama last week that it should schedule
elections to ``legitimize'' the government of President Guillermo
Endara.
   Endara became president in December when a U.S. invasion ousted
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who annulled last year's election
results when it was clear Endara was beating Noriega's candidate by
a 3-to-1 margin.
   ``President Endara's regime doesn't emanate from that military
action. It comes from the will of the Panamanian people,'' Foreign
Minister Julio Linares said Wednesday at a news conference.
   ``No country has the right to dictate the rules of the game to
us,'' he added.
   Foreign ministers of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay,
Brazil and Argentina, meeting as the Rio Group in Mexico City, sent
Panama a communique Friday, calling for elections, respect of
hemispheric diplomatic asylum accords and limits on foreign army
activities within its borders.
   Linares said the request is ``a flagrant act of intervention in
our affairs.''
   ``I don't think any self-respecting country would recognize
it,'' he said.
   He called the Latin countries' request ``unjust'' and
``unconnected with the truth.''
   Linares said Panama plans a referendum on constitutional reforms
that will demonstrate the acceptance of the government. The vote
could be scheduled in January or February, he said.
   Eighty-five people sought asylum in foreign embassies during the
invasion, and Panama has denied safe-conducts to five, Linares said.
   The five are wanted for killings and misuse of funds, he said,
urging the Rio Group to recognize Panama's right under multilateral
accords to deny asylum on those grounds.
   He also said it is up to Panama to decide about foreign troop
movements within its territory, where the United States has bases.
   Linares' comments last week deepened a rift between Mexico and
Panama over each government's legitimacy.
   After the Rio Group's demand, Endara told Mexico that its ruling
party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, uses electoral fraud
to maintain power. That provoked a protest on Monday from Mexico's
Foreign Ministry.
   In the latest exchange Wednesday, Panama told Mexico that both
countries should get over their differences, but blamed Mexico for
starting the fight.
   ``The unjustified attacks to which the legitimate and legally
constituted government (of Endara) has been subjected and his
reaction to them were the cause and effect of situation that both
sides should overcome,'' Panama said in a letter to the Mexican
Embassy.

   The nation's press is too comfortable, too
well-paid, too much part of the establishment for the country's own
good, the president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
told colleagues Wednesday.
   ``We often think of ourselves as Davids, fighting the
establishment, but the public sees us more and more as status-quo,
establishment Goliaths,'' said Loren Ghiglione, publisher and
editor of the Southbridge (Mass.) News.
   He cited a poll showing most people think that news
organizations are under the influence of ``powerful people and
organizations.''
   Ghiglione, addressing the society's 67th annual meeting,
proposed that editors each ``adopt an institution that makes us
uncomfortable _ a prison, a mental institution, a noisy,
overcrowded, big-city school, an AIDS hospital ward _ and try to
work in that world or at least understand it.''
   He told of his own experieces removing his glasses, his belt,
his watch and his shoes as he was admitted to a number of prisons
in the past year while taking part in an ASNE study of prison
journalism. Each time, he said, he vowed not to do it again, but
``in an era of law-and-order, electric-chair politics, I know I
should go back.''
   ``While we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the
comfortable, we need to guard against looking at the world
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable,'' Ghiglione said,
arguing that newspapermen have lost touch with their readers.
   ``One poll showed that half of newspaper journalists earn over
$40,000 a year, but only 18 percent of the public does,'' he said.
``And many of us live in almost exclusively white, middle-class
worlds and send our children to private or suburban public
schools.''
   He argued that the world needs ``editors who will fight.'' He
said that newspapers need to examine their own failings, should
hire ``fact checkers'' like those who work for magazines and have
reporters check their stories with sources for accuracy. And he
said the press should quit ``participating in society's lies''
through such devices as printing ``pseudo-scientific horoscopes as
`news you can use.'''
   Another speaker, David Halberstam, an author and prize-winning
reporter, told the editors that the demands by owners of newspapers
and newspaper company stocks for ever-rising profits are putting
newspapers in jeopardy.
   ``There's a question of how much water you can bring out of the
stone,'' Halberstam said. ``At what point are you taking out more
than you're putting in?''
   ``I think the threat to us is not from the outside, not from the
government, not from television, it is from ourselves.''
   In another report, Roy Aarons, an executive with the Oakland
(Calif.) Tribune, presented the results of the first survey ever
undertaken of homosexuals on the news staffs of U.S. papers. He
said 205 ``openly gay'' newspaper people volunteered to take part,
but only 13 percent agreed to be publicly identified.
   ``By overwhelming majorities, these journalists find that
coverage of gay and lesbian issues _ other than AIDS _ is at best
mediocre,'' Aarons said.
   ``Like other minorities before them, they would like to see gay
coverage veer from the sensational and toward portrayal of gays as
part of the fabric of our communities,'' he said.
   Just as newspapers failed to employ blacks to report on the
black community until the riots of the 1960s erupted, he said,
today's papers are not taking advantage of the viewpoints of their
reporters who are gay while ``scrambling to stay on top of this
rapidly evolving social issues.''
   ``Domestic partners legislation, gay adoption,
anti-discrimination laws, fundamentalist attacks on the gay
lifestyle, morality and public responsibility and, of course, the
still-raging AIDS epidemic have brought once-easily ignored issues
into demanding focus,'' Aarons wrote in his report of the survey.
   Nearly a third of the participants said they found the term
``homosexual'' to be prejudiced, explaining that it refers narrowly
to sex whereas the term ``gay'' refers to lifestyles or issues.
   ``Many newspaper editors are homophobic,'' one reporter told
Aaron's ASNE committee, ``Their anti-gay opinions, however subtle
or private, are a reflection of their systematically anti-gay
upbringings; most of the rest are afraid to publicly challenge the
status quo. How else to explain the scarcity of openly gay
newspaper executives, editors and columnists, the insufficient
number of articles on gay people and the epic silence that follows
every civil rights setback for gay people? America would rather
keep homosexuality invisible, and America's newspapers are
complicit.''
   Another participant wrote that she heard reporters and top
editors on her paper ``make snide homophobic comments and jokes
regularly,'' and added that they were ``the same people who wrote
those sensitive stories and editorials!!''

   A bomb blamed on U.S.-backed UNITA rebels
that ripped through water pipes on Wednesday forced authorities to
impose rationing in the capital, the defense ministry said.
   According to ministry, the high-powered bomb exploded about 13
miles outside the city.
   The rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, sabotaged water supplies in
the same region in mid-February as party of a stepped-up urban
guerrilla campaign that has included bomb attacks and downing
electricity lines.
   Luanda, a chaotic metropolis of 1 million residents, often faces
epidemics of cholera and other hygiene-related diseases when water
supplies are interrupted.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, has been fighting to force a power-sharing agreement with
the Soviet-backed Marxist government in Luanda since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEAD>Baker Says Peaceful Settlement In Lithuania Important To
Superpower Relationship</HEAD>

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Wednesday that
how Moscow deals with the drive for independence in Lithuania holds
``very important'' consequences for superpower relations.
   Baker's strong statement, at the conclusion of a 3{ hour session
at the State Department at the opening of a new round of
U.S.-Soviet talks, elicited a public assurance from the
Shevardnadze that the Kremlin would find a peaceful solution in the
Baltic Republic.
   ``Let me tell you very authoritatively and seriously I have no
doubt we will be able to find a solution to that situation, that we
will find a wise and fair solution,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He added, without elaboration, that it would be in the interests
of the Lithuanian people, the entire Soviet Union, Europe and peace.
   At the conclusion of the first of three days of scheduled talks,
Baker said Shevardnadze had brought a letter for President Bush
from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baker declined to
disclose any of the contents, saying that was up to Bush, who will
meet with Shevardnadze at the White House on Friday morning.
   The two ministers also discussed nuclear missiles. They hope to
agree on the extent of the limitations to be placed on
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in a treaty Bush and Gorbachev would
like to sign at a summit meeting here in June.
   But the dramatic disagreement between Lithuanians determined to
have their own nation and a Kremlin determined to avoid splintering
the Soviet Union drew most of the public attention.
   ``This is a very, very important matter,'' Baker said. ``I have
pointed out to the minister how very important it is in terms of
the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Baker said there was no disagreement with Shevardnadze ``with
respect to its importance, and with respect to the importance of
resolving it through dialogue and through peaceful means.''
   Earlier, Baker told reporters he was encouraged that the Soviets
seemed to be considering a referendum in Lithuania to determine its
future.
   ``A referendum is, of course, one way for parties to express
self-determination,'' Baker said before he escorted Shevardnadze to
his 7th floor office.
   ``We will be exploring the question of the degree to which there
is, in fact, the beginning of some dialogue in Moscow,'' Baker said.
   Baker said he intended to ask Shevardnadze about the
cancellation of scheduled meetings between Lithuanians and
officials of the Soviet Interior ministry. Shevardnadze, however,
seemed to be unaware of such scheduled meetings.
   ``What happened today I have no information yet,'' the foreign
minister said through an interpreter.
   Later, neither Baker nor Shevardnadze gave any indication how
the matter was resolved.
   But responding to a question before his meeting with Baker, the
foreign minister insisted the Soviets had not used force to deal
with the secession movement in Lithuania.
   ``Of course,'' he said, ``in any country, in any state, measures
are taken in order to have order, in order to have a normal
situation. And this is this elementary order that is being
established.''
   The State Department lobby was cordoned off and dozens of
uniformed guards and security agents in civilian garb kept watch. A
guard with a German Shepherd dog stood at the entrance.
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers pushed Bush to take a stronger stand
on Lithuania.
   House members voted 416-3 to approve a resolution urging the
president to reaffirm his commitment to an independent Lithuania
and take steps to normalize diplomatic relations between Washington
and Lithuania.
   The resolution, which carries no legal weight, is similar to one
passed earlier by the Senate.
   Meanwhile, 31 senators told Bush in a letter that U.S. warnings
against the use of military force in Lithuania have not been
effective. The administration, the letter said, must spell out the
consequences Moscow will face if more force is used.
   The Baker-Shevardnadze sessions are expected to produce a date
for Bush's Washington summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev. U.S. officials said several options were being
considered for holding the summit before the Soviet People's
Congress in Moscow in early July.
   ``We're pretty flexible on dates,'' Fitzwater said.
   The administration has been banking on a peaceful solution to
tensions between Lithuania and the Kremlin over the independence
movement.
   ``A referendum is a starting point on the road to independence,
which we support,'' said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   A law passed by the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday provides that the
first step in a secession process would be for a republic to hold a
referendum. If the referendum gets the necessary two-thirds
approval, a transition period of no more than five years ensues.
   The Soviet Constitution, itself, has allowed secession, but
without a legal mechanism to carry it out.
   The official said the new procedure could give the Lithuanians
and the Soviets time to resolve economic and political questions
raised during the independence drive and that it might not take
five years..
   Baker was buoyed by the meeting Alexandr N. Yakolev, a close
adviser to Gorbachev, held in Moscow on Tuesday with a delegation
of officials from Lithuania, and the pledge of an ``honest
dialogue'' by Shevardnadze in an arrival statement Tuesday.
   ``There would appear, at least, to be the beginnings of such a
dialogue,'' Baker said. ``We are encouraged as well that we see
references coming from both sides to the concept of the possibility
of some sort of a referendum approach.''
   Lithuanian leaders told the Kremlin last week that they were
ready to discuss the issue of a referendum on secession if
Gorbachev agreed to talks. The Soviet leader, having demanded the
nullification of a March 11 declaration of independence, did not
respond immediately.

   President Bush called on the black majority in
South Africa on Wednesday to follow the example of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and renounce violence.
   In a speech on the anniversary of King's 1968 assassination,
Bush also predicted that one day, ``not far off,'' a black person
will be president of the United States.
   ``When that day comes, the most remarkable thing about it will
be how naturally it occurs,'' he said in remarks to the 20th
anniversary dinner for the Joint Center for Political Studies, a
nonprofit research organization that focuses on blacks in politics
and society.
   He used the occasion to call for an end to the state of
emergency imposed by South Africa's white minority government and
the freeing of all political prisoners there.
   ``Most of all, there must be an end to the tragic cycle of
violence, a task that demands great courage and resolve from all
South African leaders, black and white,'' Bush said.
   ``Most tragically, the senseless violence perpetuated by blacks
against blacks has become a major impediment to rapid progress
toward a negotiated settlement,'' he said. ``All sides should
follow the spirit of Mare Senate-passed measure to the president's desk
for his signature.
   President Bush is expected to sign the measure, which would
require the Justice Department to keep data on crimes related to
victims' race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnic group. It is
supported by a variety of civil rights, ethnic and police groups.
   Actually, the House already had passed the measure and this time
merely consented to minor changes made when the Senate approved the
bill on Feb. 8.
   Crimes that would be counted are murder, non-negligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault,
intimidation, arson and destruction, damage or vandalism of
property.
   First proposed in 1984 by Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., the
legislation grew from a series of arson incidents at synagogues in
Kennelly's central Connecticut district.
   Authorities were never able to determine that racial or religiou
prejudices led to the crimes.
   Some supporters say the measure is needed because of a rising
tide of ``hate crimes'' on the part of neo-Nazi skinheads and other
such groups, although there is no certainty that such offenses are
on the increase.
   A May 1988 Justice Department report said an accurate count is
not available. But it said: ``These types of offenses are far more
serious than comparable crimes that do not involve prejudice
because they are intended to intimidate an entire group.''
   Estimates of the cost to collect the information have ranged
from $1 million a year to $10 million a year. The Justice
Department has said it would have no trouble making hate crimes
part of its annually published uniform crime reports.
   The bill was brought to the floor Tuesday night and debated but
the vote was delayed until Wednesday. There was no debate on
Wednesday.
   The only lawmaker to rise in opposition to the bill was Rep.
William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who portrayed it as a concession to
the gay community.
   ``Believe me, whether we like to accept it or not, there are
persons outside this chamber who are crowing: namely, in the
homosexual community,'' he told the House.
   He said homosexuals ``now have something in the law which they
have sought diligently for the last 20 years, whereby they will
equate homosexuality on a part with the traditional coverage of the
1964 Civil Rights Act ...''

   Singer Gloria Estefan, recuperating from a broken
back suffered in a tour bus accident, was welcomed home by fans
Wednesday after being released from a New York hospital.
   ``It's great to be home,'' Miami Sound Machine's 32-year-old
vocalist told about 150 people gathered at the airport, expressing
her gratitude to news media and to fans who showered her with
encouragement, flowers and cards.
   ``I have felt every one of those prayers from the first
moment,'' Estefan said. ``I think that was very important in the
way that I feel and the way I recuperate.''
   Estefan suffered broken vertebrae when a tractor-trailer struck
her tour bus March 21 on a snowy Pennsylvania highway. She was
transferred to the New York hospital the next day, and doctors
performed delicate surgery to implant two steel rods in her spine.
   Estefan flew home Wednesday in a jet borrowed from entertainer
Julio Iglesias. She walked down the steps of the aircraft, then
rode in a wheelchair to a nearby podium, where she stood again to
address fans and loved ones.
   She thanked her family, especially her husband Emilio, ``who
waited until we got to the hospital before he fainted, and my son
Nayib, who held my hand while we waited for the ambulances. He was
very brave.''
   The two presented her with a bouquet of yellow roses before she
left the jet.
   At a news conference in New York before her release from the
Orthopedic Institute for Joint Diseases, Estefan described the
accident and its aftermath as the most difficult experience of her
life and said she was simply ``thankful for the miracle of being
alive.''
   ``I promise I will work 100 percent to come back,'' she said.
   Estefan's surgeon, Dr. Michael Neuwirth, said the singer faces
about six months of rehabilitation but added, ``We fully expect her
to return and perform again.''
   Estefan thanked the hospital staff for their support and had
warm praise for the private nurses who ``helped me learn to sit and
walk again.''
   She praised her doctors, who she said ``gave me a couple of
spare parts to go home with'' and joked that Neuwirth assured her
``I wouldn't beep when I go through airport security.''
   Estefan, who was nominated for a Grammy award this year, said
she planned to spend her time exercising, reading, sleeping and
eating.
   ``It's the first time in my life I'll actually have to put on
pounds,'' she joked, adding, ``Hopefully, in a few months, I'll be
back good as new.''

   Former President Jimmy Carter praised PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat at the end of two meetings Wednesday for what he said
were Arafat's efforts to advance peace in the Middle East.
   ``He has done everything possible these last months to promote
the peace process,'' Carter said after a 90-minute private meeting
at the Hotel Crillon. ``He's explored all the possibilities to make
progress toward a total peace settlement.''
   A jovial Arafat told reporters the peace process was given a new
impetus by the Crillon meeting with Carter and one earlier
Wednesday that included President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``I met the former president of the United States, the architect
of Camp David, who constructed the peace treaty between the largest
Arab country (Egypt) and Israel,'' said the leader of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. ``He consulted with President Bush ...
before coming.''
   Arafat described Carter as a ``personality of great stature.''
He said Carter offered no new proposals, but their talks touched on
all Mideast issues.
   Carter spokeswoman Melissa Montgomery denied reports in the
French press that Carter was on a special mission for Bush.
   Carter accused Middle East leaders of dragging their feet on the
peace process.
   ``The problem is among the leaders who don't adequately
represent the concerns of the people (for peace), in Israel, among
the Palestinians, the Syrians, the Jordanians, the Lebanese,''
Carter said.
   He called peace ``inevitable.''
   The former president, accompanied by his wife Rosalynn, shook
Arafat's hand as they left Elysee Palace following the meeting
including Mitterrand.
   At his news conference, Arafat delivered a stinging attack on
the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Israeli leaders predict hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews
will arrive in Israel the next few years. The PLO fears they will
settle in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the PLO
hopes to establish an independent state.
   Holding aloft a crudely drawn map of a Jewish state expanded by
immigration and extending into Saudi Arabia, Arafat said a
``greater Israel'' would be an obstacle to peace. ``No one can stop
Jews from emigrating from the Soviet Union, but we are opposed to a
massive transfer,'' he said.
   He praised advice given to Israel by Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to keep occupied territories off-limits to
Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   Carter and Arafat arrived for overnight visits. Arafat is
expected in Rome on an official visit Thursday and his third
meeting with Pope John Paul II. Carter was going to Oslo, Norway.
   Carter told reporters that he, Arafat and Mitterrand discussed
delays in the peace process and how it could be rejuvenated. ``We
had a common hope that these delays might now be overcome.''
   Arafat said Wednesday's meetings proved that ``peace initiatives
are not only Palestinian, that they are international.''
   Jewish leaders objected to Arafat's meetings in Paris. The head
of a coalition of French Jewish groups, Jean Kahn, demanded a
meeting with Carter, saying he wanted him to explain his talks with
Arafat.
   Police vans lined the Place de la Concorde and at least 200 riot
police stood guard near the hotel on the edge of the Place where
Arafat was staying.
   About 50 youthful Jewish demonstrators clashed with a half-dozen
hecklers at the Place during rush-hour traffic. At least one person
was injured but there were no arrests.
   ``We are against the visit of the terrorist Arafat here,'' said
Edwin Sberro, a student and member of the Betar Tagar Zionist
movement. ``Carter shouldn't talk with a terrorist like Arafat.''
   Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses
to negotiate with it.
   A meeting between Arafat and Carter had been expected for days,
but Mitterrand's office made a surprise announcement Wednesday that
the French leader would play host for initial talks.
   Arafat last came to Paris in May 1989, when he met Mitterrand
and declared that the PL0 Charter was ``caduc'' _ a French word
meaning either ``outdated'' or ``null and void.''
   As president, Carter oversaw the negotiation of the 1979 Camp
David accords that led to peace between Israel and Egypt. Carter
recently concluded a Middle East tour of Israel, Syria, Egypt and
Jordan.

   One of space shuttle Atlantis' fuel
cells probably was damaged because excessive pressure was exerted
when the unit was being prepared for removal, NASA said Wednesday.
   The extent of damage was not immediately known, said Dick Young,
a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   There are enough other fuel cells in the system for flight, and
any damage will not affect Atlantis' next mission in July. Atlantis
returned to Kennedy Space Center on March 13 following a secret
Pentagon mission to send a $500 million spy satellite into orbit.
   Fuel cells provide electrical power to space shuttles through a
reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   One of the fuel cell unit's 96 individual cells had failed a
voltage test during a postflight checkout March 31, Young said.
   NASA decided to remove the entire unit and return it for repair
to the vendor, International Fuel Cells of Hartford, Conn., Young
said. The unit had been purged with gaseous helium following the
March 31 test, and residual gas pressure was being vented out
Wednesday.
   ``As the operation proceeded, it became apparent that the oxygen
vent was working but the hydrogen vent was not,'' NASA said in a
statement issued Wednesday night. ``It was discovered that a cap
had been placed on the vehicle's hydrogen vent port, possibly as a
conclusion of the March 31 electrical test.''
   The procedure was halted immediately, and the area was cleared
of workers as a safety precaution, Young said.
   The oxygen and hydrogen sides of the fuel cells are divided by a
plate an eighth of an inch thick containing potassium hydroxide, a
corrosive chemical used as an electrolyte. Pressure normally is
kept higher on the oxygen side of the cell to keep the potassium
hydroxide from seeping through.
   Young said the potassium hydroxide likely was forced into the
oxygen side of the cell, causing the difference in pressure on
either side to exceed allowable levels. That could affect the fuel
cell's operation and corrode the oxygen piping, he said.
   The fuel cell will be removed as soon as possible, Young said.
   Young said NASA planned to appoint a review board to investigate
the matter. He declined to comment further.

   Former President Gerald R. Ford
underwent surgery Wednesday to replace his left knee with an
artificial joint because of injuries dating back to his high school
football days, a spokeswoman said.
   Ford, 76, went into surgery at 9 a.m. at the Eisenhower Medical
Center in Rancho Mirage, said Ford's chief of staff, Penny Circle.
The procedure, performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Murphy,
took 90 minutes, she said.
   ``The surgery was very successful without any problems or
complications,'' Circle said. ``President Ford is resting
comfortably.''
   He was in good condition Wednesday night, Circle said.
   ``He tolerated the procedure extremely well. He is in phenomenal
physical condition for his age,'' Murphy said.
   Ford will have to have his right knee replaced in October for
similar injuries, Murphy said. The left knee had already been
operated on three times, he said.
   ``He has had very bad arthritis in both of his knees dating to
when he played football in the 1930s,'' Murphy said. ``He's just
gotten to the point where he was walking bone-on-bone. There was no
cartilege.''
   Murphy replaced Ford's knee with a titanium prosthesis called a
Miller Gallante II total knee, said hospital spokeswoman Sally
Manassah.
   Former first lady Betty Ford was with the president at the
hospital, the chief of staff said.
   Ford was to remain hospitalized for four to five days, and will
undergo physical therapy for up to eight weeks, Circle said.
   Ford elected to have the surgery because of continuing problems
with the knee, first injured when he played center for the South
High School football team in Grand Rapids, Mich., and later at the
University of Michigan, she said.
   The injuries were aggravated by skiing and tennis, she said.
   Ford played for Michigan's national championship football teams
in 1932 and 1933. The following year he was named the university
team's most valuable player and played in an east-west all-star
game.
   Rancho Mirage is about 120 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Estonia it
must back off from its declaration that it is an independent
country illegally occupied by the Soviet Union, the president of
this Baltic republic said Wednesday.
   Estonia is cautiously following the lead of its neighbor
Lithuania, which declared independence on March 11. Estonian
President Arnold Ruutel said Soviet President Gorbachev indicated
he might react in the same tough manner.
   Ruutel, interviewed by Estonian radio, quoted Gorbachev as
saying, ``When I heard of your resolution I was completely beside
myself. You must declare the resolution null and void. It is an
invalid one.''
   ``It seems to me that I have to introduce similar measures as
those taken in Lithuania,'' he quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   Soviet soldiers occupied public buildings in Vilnius, the
capital of Lithuania, arrested some Lithuanian deserters and sent
convoys through Vilnius as a show of force. Gorbachev ordered
Lithuanians to hand over their weapons.
   Lithuanian legislators on Wednesday accused Moscow of
threatening to overthrow their independent government, dampening
some heartening talk of compromise from officials on both sides.
   A statement adopted by Lithuania's Supreme Council legislature
said, ``The Soviet Union, with the aid of its army, supports a
small group of its political supporters which is attempting to
restore the old structures of the Soviet administration.
   ``There is therefore a threat to overthrow the legally elected
authority and the government.''
   The statement was read on Lithuanian radio and monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Washington on Wednesday that how
Moscow deals with Lithuania holds ``very important'' consequences
for U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Shevardnadze gave public assurance the Kremlin would find a
peaceful solution.
   As the two men opened three days of talks, the U.S. House of
Representatives approved overwhelmingly a resolution urging
President Bush to reaffirm his commitment to Lithuania.
   Both Lithuanian and Soviet officials on Wednesday praised a
meeting the night before between a delegation of Lithuanian
officials and Soviet Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev in
Moscow _ the first direct contact between leaders of the two sides
since the day after Lithuania declared independence.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh on Wednesday
called the Lithuanians' meeting with Yakovlev ``a positive sign''
the two sides will be able to resolve their confrontation.
   Gorbachev said Saturday that Lithuania must renounce its
declaration of independence before negotiations can begin on ending
the dispute.
   Ruutel did not elaborate when asked by the radio interviewer
what steps Gorbachev might have in mind regarding Estonia.
   Gorbachev also spoke Wednesday at a meeting in Moscow with
Communist leaders of Latvia, the third Baltic republic.
   All three Baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940 following a secret pact between Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union in 1939.
   The Latvian party will hold a congress this weekend. It follows
a congress in Lithuania in December and in Estonia in March at
which their Baltic comrades decided to split with the main
Communist Party.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the discussion centered on
ways to increase Latvia's sovereignty and increase the role of the
Latvian Communist Party. It gave no details.
   Estonia's declaration calling itself a sovereign but occupied
country came Friday and was aimed at laying the groundwork for a
return to independence at the end of a still-undefined transition
period.
   Marju Lauristin, deputy speaker of the Estonian Supreme Soviet,
said Estonia would not back off.
   She said she was optimistic Moscow would prove willing to
discuss Estonia's bid for independence. ``In spite of this first
negative reaction, it is a contact and every contact is needed for
negotiations,'' she said.
   Ms. Lauristin is a leader of the Estonian People's Front, the
political movement that advocates complete independence from Moscow.
   On Tuesday, the105-member Estonian Supreme Soviet elected Edgar
Savisaar, now chairman of the People's Front, as the republic's new
premier.
   Savisaar said the main task of his Cabinet will be to restore
Estonia's full independence. He said Communists would not be
excluded from the government but indicated their role would be
diminishing.
   Pavel Panfilov, a leader of non-Estonians who oppose
independence, said, ``I think it's the aim of the ethnic Estonians
to make as many non-Estonians leave the republic as soon as
possible.
   ``Estonia has to belong to the Soviet Union. There is no other
way.''
   Ethnic Estonians make up about 60 percent of the republic's 1.6
million people. Slavs and other non-Estonian nationalities have
expressed fear the move toward independence would hurt their
interests.

   Lithuanian legislators accused Moscow on Wednesday
of threatening to overthrow their independent government, dampening
some heartening talk of compromise from officials on both sides.
   ``The Soviet Union, with the aid of its army, supports a small
group of its political supporters who are attempting to restore the
old structures of the Soviet administration,'' said a statement
adopted by the Supreme Council legislature.
   ``There is therefore a threat to overthrow the legally elected
authority and the government.''
   The statement was read on Lithuanian radio and monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London. Legislative spokesmen
confirmed by telephone that the statement was adopted by
legislators.
   After an opening 3{-hour session Wednesday in three days of
talks scheduled in Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III told Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that the
way Moscow handles the Lithuanian crisis holds ``very important''
consequences for U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The Soviet minister publicly assured Baker the Soviets will find
a peaceful solution.
   The U.S. House of Representatives by a 416-3 vote approved a
resolution urging President Bush to reaffirm his commitment to
Lithuania.
   Both Lithuanian and Soviet officials on Wednesday praised a
Moscow meeting the night before between a Lithuanian delegation and
Soviet Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev. It marked the first
direct contact between leaders of the two sides since the day after
Lithuania declared independence on March 11.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were forcibly incorporated into
the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Thousands of people opposed to independence rallied outside the
legislative chambers in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, on
Wednesday and Lithuanian sources said one young man who unfurled a
pro-independence banner was beaten.
   A spokeswoman for the legislature's information service, who
refused to be identified, quoted Lithuanian Deputy Premier
Romualdas Ozolas as telling a news conference the talks with
Yakovlev were ``fruitful and useful.''
   But Ozolas refused to go into detail, saying the contacts were
unofficial and confidential, she added.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis told the news conference the
talks represented a dialogue rather than simply an exchange of
messages. Lithuanian leaders said they hoped regular contacts could
develop out of the meeting.
   Most foreign correspondents were forced by Soviet officials to
leave Lithuania days ago, and so could not report directly from the
Baltic republic.
   The Lithuanian Supreme Council statement accused the Soviet
Union of blocking international communications with Lithuania and
cited the Soviet decision to ban foreign reporters and diplomats.
   ``These and other aggressive actions by the Soviet Union crudely
violate universally recognized principles of international law,
create a real threat to the state sovereignty of the Lithuanian
republic, and the life and health of its people,'' it said.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri D. Gremitskikh
characterized the meeting between the Lithuanians and Yakovlev as
``a positive sign'' the two sides will be able to resolve their
differences.
   ``I think it's very important that Lithuanian representatives
are aware of the ideas and thoughts that are held here in Moscow,''
Gremitskikh said. ``Our colleagues in Lithuania just have to tear
themselves away from their narrow views and look at all these
problems through the prism of the fact that a new basis for the
federation is being created.''
   Ivan Laptev, editor of the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia
and newly chosen chief of the Soviet of the Union, one of two
chambers of the Soviet legislature, said, ``I'm convinced there
will be a successful dialogue.''
   The Soviet Defense Ministry, in a statement distributed by the
Tass news agency, accused the Lithuanian government of interfering
with the draft of young Lithuanian men into the army this spring.
   Lithuanian legislators still were working Wednesday on their
official response to Gorbachev's message sent March 31 demanding
that the republic renounce its declaration of independence.
   Gorbachev has ordered Lithuanians to hand over their firearms,
and Soviet soldiers arrested some Lithuanians who deserted from the
army. The Soviet military occupied several Vilnius buildings and
moved troops and armor through Vilnius in a show of force.
   Lithuania residents opposed to independence rallied outside
legislative headquarters. Legislative spokesmen estimated about
5,000 people took part. Tass put the number at almost 10,000.
   Protesters carried signs asking the Lithuanian government to
``listen to the voice of reason'' and demanding it not split with
the Soviet Union, Tass said. Some called for Gorbachev to impose
direct presidential rule, it said.
   Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman for the Supreme Council's
information service, said by telephone he saw one young man beaten
after he unfurled a pro-independence banner from atop a TV camera
platform.
   Palubinskas said the crowd overturned the platform, chased the
young man and beat him. He said police did not interfere for fear
of worsening the conflict.

   Key members of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee negotiated behind closed doors late Wednesday in an
attempt to craft a compromise on the acid rain provision of a clean
air bill.
   A day after the Senate approved a sweeping air pollution control
bill of its own, the focus of the debated shifted to the House
where the committee is trying to work out final details of similar
legislation.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the panel's chairman, said he hopes
remaining issues can be settled this week and a final committee
vote taken. That might lead to House floor action on the bill early
next month.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., floated a revised proposal aimed at
helping Midwest utilities cope with tough new acid rain pollution
controls. The proposal involved a complex system of ``pollution
allowances'' and was similar to a provision already in the Senate
bill, according to committee sources.
   But as of 10 p.m. EDT, the measure was still being discussed and
sources said it was unlikely a final agreement could be reached
before Thursday.
   The Senate voted 89-11 late Tuesday in favor of a sweeping clean
air bill that imposes new emission controls on automobiles,
factories and electric power plants. The bill was a product of a
compromise agreement between Senate leaders and the White House.
   President Bush, at a White House meeting, congratulated Senate
leaders for ``helping us at last break the legislative logjam on
clean air,'' but called it ``only a first step.''
   ``More progress is going to be needed if we're to achieve the
balanced bill that is essential,'' Bush said. He said the White
House would keep pushing in the House and in the eventual
conference committee for changes to ensure cleaner air ``without
major job loss.''
   Neither industry nor environmentalists have been happy about the
Senate legislation with environmental groups calling it inadequate
to solve urban smog problems and industry charging its toxic
chemical controls and acid rain provisions are too expensive.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, meeting with reporters
on Wednesday, said he would have preferred that it were stronger in
some areas, including tougher second-round controls on automobile
emissions.
   But Mitchell called the bill ``strong and comprehensive.''
Mitchell said he knew early on that he did not have enough votes to
stop a filibuster on the original Senate bill and concluded the
only way to enact the legislation was to work out a compromise with
the Bush administration.
   ``We did what was necessary to pass the bill,'' said Mitchell.
   Mitchell indicated that he intended to push for some
improvements he favored when the bill goes to a conference
committee to be reconciled with the eventual House legislation.
   Much of the fight in the House, however, was expected to revolve
around the strong acid rain control measures included in both the
House and Senate legislation.
   Both bills call for a 10 million ton reduction in the annual
releases of sulfur dioxide from coal-fired electric power plants.
The curbs will hit Midwest utilities especially hard because they
rely heavily on high-sulfur coal and have some of the dirtiest
plants.
   A group of congressmen led by Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., has
sought to include in the House bill a ``cost sharing'' measure to
ease the financial burden of cleaning up the Midwest plants.
   The Senate provided some help by allowing Midwest states special
pollution allowances that could be sold to other utilities, but
generally rejected _ as has the White House _ further cost-sharing
ideas.
   Dingell has proposed some cost-sharing options and Sharp was
continuing to pursue a proposal calling for a fee on industrial
polluters of sulfur dioxide, which are not covered by the acid rain
provision, to offset the costs to utilities.
   If the acid rain issues can be resolved, there appears little
impediment on getting the bill out of committee before Congress
goes on its Easter recess at the end of the week, a congressional
source suggested. Dingell said he hoped for a final vote Thursday
or Friday.

   Residents of AIDS patient Ryan White's old
hometown, many of whom fought to keep the teen-ager out of their
schools, expressed hope Wednesday that he'd win his latest battle _
this one for his life.
   ``I hope he gets better and is able to do something in life,''
said Brian Correll, 22, a student at Indiana Unversity's Kokomo
campus. ``I hope he can enjoy life a little more.''
   White, 18, remained in critical condition at Riley Hospital for
Children in Indianapolis, where he has been hospitalized since
March 29 with an AIDS-related respiratory infection complicated by
his hemophilia.
   Singer Elton John spent his second full day at White's room,
playing tapes of his music, family spokewoman Carrie Van Dyke said.
   ``He's strictly here as a friend,'' Van Dyke said. ``He goes in
and talks to Ryan, holds his hand and changes his music.''
   Also Wednesday, a U.S. Senate committee voted unanimously for a
bill aimed at easing the nation's AIDS crisis.
   ``This one's for you, Ryan,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said in a telephone conversation with White's mother, Jeannie,
after the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved the
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act. The bill, which has
bipartisan support, would provide an additional $600 million a year
for two years to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   White's physician, Dr. Martin B. Kleiman, said there was still
cause for hope.
   ``He's holding on. His status deteriorated in the first day or
two and then reached a plateau,'' Kleiman said. ``Any patient who
is critical must stabilize before he can recover and Ryan has
stabilized.
   ``There have been patients who have been this ill and have
recovered,'' the doctor said. ``We can maintain patients at this
level for prolonged periods of time.''
   White is on a life-support system. He has been unconscious and
heavily sedated so the equipment would function more efficiently.
   White, who contracted AIDS from contaminated blood products, has
waged a five-year battle with the disease during which he grew from
an object of scorn in his hometown of Kokomo into an international
spokesman for AIDS patients. He fought a successful court battle to
attend school and helped reinforce the message that AIDS cannot be
spread through casual contact.
   ``I was stunned when I heard he was back in the hospital,'' said
Kokomo resident Ron Shanks. ``I just figured he'd keep on living. I
hope he can pull through.''
   ``I hope he pulls out of this,'' said David Rosselot, the
attorney hired by a group of Western Middle School parents to keep
White out of school.
   In 1985, Rosselot pressed a lawsuit that relied on a state law
barring children with communicable diseases from attending school.
   ``The attempt of the parents at that time was not to keep Ryan
White out of school. The intent of the lawsuit was to keep acquired
immune deficiency syndrome out of school,'' he said.
   Rosselot said he would not take a similar case today.
   ``I don't think that anybody in Kokomo feels good about what
happened,'' said Art Peirce, an 18-year resident of Kokomo.
   ``I think it's something that had to happen,'' he said. ``The
fear had to be expressed and if hadn't happened here it would have
happened somewhere else.''

   A confident, smiling Premier Li Peng asserted
Wednesday that China's leadership is united and strong and that the
public does not want a renewal of the massive pro-democracy
protests of last year.
   Li's comments to reporters were his first since the protests
were crushed last June. Also Wednesday, the Chinese parliament
wrapped up its two-week annual session with measures calling for
freer business practices but tougher law and order policies.
   The 3,000-seat National People's Congress, which largely
rubber-stamps decisions by top Communist Party and government
officials, also gave final approval to the basic law under which
Hong Kong will be governed after Britain returns it to China in
1997.
   Legislators in Hong Kong immediately said the law was not
democratic enough and asked that it be amended.
   Li was among top leaders on the rostrum at the congress' final
meeting in the Great Hall of the People. Afterward, he told the
annual post-congress news conference that the session was
``inspiring and heartening.''
   The army killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people in
June while crushing the pro-democracy movement.
   While other officials have lost their tempers while answering
foreign reporters' questions about the killings, Li merely smiled
and refused to answer.
   ``Isn't this question out of date?'' he said when asked who gave
the army the order to shoot at protesters.
   Li predicted that Beijing's Tiananmen Square, at the center of
the protests, would remain peaceful Thursday. That is when Chinese
celebrate the Qing Ming Festival, a day to honor the dead.
   Exiled Chinese dissidents had urged Beijing residents to mourn
those killed in June by strolling in the square Thursday. They
urged similar action last Sunday, but Chinese authorities closed
the square to the public all day and held an official rally there.
   And on Thursday, police again cordoned off Tiananmen Square. On
the nearly deserted, 100-acre square, authorized groups of
flag-waving schoolchildren joined soldiers for rites marking
Chingming while police guards kept out the general public.
   ``We do not hope to see a repeat of (last year's) chaos, nor do
the Chinese people hope to see a repeat of it,'' Li said Wednesday.
``We believe Tiananmen Square will pass the day in an orderly way.''
   Some Beijing work units have barred employees from wearing black
armbands or white flowers of mourning Thursday. The city has
limited the number of people who can visit crematoriums, where the
ashes of the dead are stored.
   Li, asked about his chances of being re-elected in 1993, said he
did not consider himself ``extremely capable'' but said rumors in
Hong Kong that he was in political trouble were bad guesses.
   ``The core of leadership in China with (party) General Secretary
Jiang Zemin as its nucleus is united and strong, and I believe it
commands the support of the Chinese people,'' he said.
   He rejected a political comeback for Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted
as general secretary in June for allegedly supporting the
pro-democracy protests. He said Zhao was still being investigated
by the party but had not been stripped of his membership. Zhao is
living at home in ``very good conditions'' and in good health, Li
said.
   Zhao, who favored negotiations with the protesters, was last
seen publicly on May 19, when he visited the demonstrators in the
square.
   Before adjourning, the National People's Congress amended the
joint venture law to allow foreigners to become joint venture
chairmen and ruled out nationalization. China hopes the changes
will attract more foreign investment, which has fallen since the
army crackdown.
   The legislature also passed a resolution calling for
strengthened ``public security, national unity (and) education in
patriotism, collectivism, socialism and national defense.''
   Under the basic law for Hong Kong, the territory ruled by
Britain since 1842 is promised a high degree of autonomy within
China and protection of its capitalist economic system for at least
50 years. However, many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents fear
the guarantees are not strong enough, and they already are
emigrating to escape Communist rule.
   The colony's legislature voted 20-6 on Wednesday to ask China to
change the law before 1997. China's National People's Congress must
approve any changes. The Hong Kong legislature wants faster
progress on direct elections and eventual direct election of all 60
members of the Hong Kong legislature.
   The law provides for a 60-seat local legislature in which 20
members could be directly elected at first, 24 members in 1999 and
30 members in the year 2003. It also sets up a complicated
split-voting procedure that gives appointed legislators power to
veto controversial bills.
   After Hong Kong residents loudly supported last year's massive
pro-democracy protests on the mainland, China added provisions for
declaring a state of emergency in Hong Kong. It also banned
subversive activities and contacts between Hong Kong and foreign
political groups.

   Police cordoned off Tiananmen Square for the
second time in a week Thursday, blocking possible attempts to mourn
the victims of last year's crushed pro-democracy movement.
   On the nearly deserted, 100-acre square, authorized groups of
flag-waving schoolchildren joined soldiers for rites marking
Chingming, the annual occasion when Chinese honor their dead.
   Police guards stood at 30-foot intervals around the perimeter to
keep out the general public, while dozens of police with
walkie-talkies patrolled adjacent streets.
   Overseas dissidents had called on Beijing students to ``stroll''
through the square on Chingming in a silent memorial to the
hundreds, perhaps thousands of people killed when the military
stormed the city last June to wrest control of Tiananmen from
pro-democracy students.
   A similar appeal to walk through the square on Sunday was
blocked when authorities closed it to the public, on that occasion
for ceremonies to promote support for the Asian Games to be held in
Beijing next fall.
   Beijing schools and factories have warned young people to stay
away from Tiananmen and advised them against wearing black armbands
or the traditional white mourning flower on Chingming.
   The city has also issued orders forbidding group memorial
activities unless authorities grant permission.
   Some students have said they wanted to go to Tiananmen. Others
say they are frightened by warnings of repercussions and will stay
away.
   Security around the square has been noticeably increased. A
dozen plainclothes police loitered outside the Great Hall of the
People to the west of the square. Police vans and jeeps were parked
at strategic points.
   Inside, children wearing the yellow caps of the Young Pioneers,
a youth group that gives ideological training, participated in
ceremonies around the monument to revolutionary martyrs.
   Red banners on the monument called on people to honor the
Chinese revolution and to ``raise our Chinese spirit.''
   Multicolored flags around the square gave it a festive look, but
police yelled at foreigners who tried to take photographs.
   Premier Li Peng, asked at a news conference Wednesday about
tightened security around the square, said Tiananmen is the symbol
of Beijing and China and that it was ``quite normal'' for police
``to take all necessary measures to preserve order'' in the square.

   Police said Wednesday they are checking
into reports that the fiery crash of a small plane may have been
the result of a suicide-bound passenger who struggled for control
of the craft.
   The Cessna 421 Golden Eagle streaked over the foothills west of
Boulder on Sunday, slammed into a tree, then destroyed a vacant
house, four garages and six parked cars, engulfing a large section
of the residential block in flames. Killed were Gordon Larry Hood,
45, and the pilot, James Wilford ``Bill'' Layne, 56, police said.
   Eyewitnesses reported that the plane flipped onto its side and
went into a power dive, behavior that might reflect a struggle
going on in the cockpit, said police spokesman David Grimm.
   ``Was the pilot overpowered, was the pilot shot, was the pilot
stabbed? We just don't know,'' Grimm said. ``As far as we can tell
right now, the pilot just happens to be the unfortunate person who
got hired that day.''
   Police asked the National Transportation Safety Board to allow
them back into the crash site after two out-of-state acquaintances
told investigators that Hood was suicidal, Grimm said.
   ``The sources gave us information when we spoke to them that
there were indications made to them that Mr. Hood was potentially
contemplating suicide and in a manner similar to what occurred,''
Grimm said.
   ``We thought we were investigating an air accident, and it has
turned into something else.''
   Authorities released Hood's identity Wednesday, saying he is
believed to be from Atlanta, but had recently moved to the Denver
area. They believe Hood was a photographer.
   Layne, an employee of Intensive Air Care, a Denver-based private
charter company, had taken Hood to Granby, a mountain community
about 80 miles northwest of Denver, and the two were returning to
Denver when the plane crashed.
   ``We don't necessarily get the impression that there was
physical struggle going on,'' Grimm said. ``It could simply have
been a struggle over control of the aircraft.''
   Autopsy results released Tuesday showed Hood and Layne died of
injuries suffered in the plane crash and not from other causes,
according to Tom Faure, chief medical investigator of the Boulder
County coroner's office.
   Grimm said Hood was seen carrying a briefcase into a post office
in Granby, and investigators believe he mailed some cards or
letters there.
   Police are asking anyone who may have received mail from Hood to
contact them.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
seeking a Soviet plan for a peaceful settlement in Lithuania and a
date for the next superpower summit during three days of talks with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker also hopes to work out limits to be placed on
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in a treaty designated for signing
at the summit by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   Also on the agenda is the war in Angola between the Soviet-armed
government and U.S.-aided rebels. Baker is trying for a cease-fire
but insists on a commitment from the Luanda government that it will
share power with the UNITA guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi.
   Before the opening round beginning late this afternoon, U.S.
officials had no word on whether Shevardnadze brought a reply from
Gorbachev to Bush's letter last week reiterating U.S. hopes for a
peaceful settlement in Lithuania.

   Lithuanian officials say they are encouraged after
a breakthrough meeting with a key adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
but they will not abide by a new law that would make secession
lengthy and costly.
   President Gorbachev, who refused to meet with the three-member
Lithuanian delegation, decreed Saturday that the republic repeal
its March 11 declaration of independence before negotiations can
begin.
   Tuesday's talks were thus considered preliminary, though they
constituted the first high-level contact between Lithuania and
Moscow since the declaration.
   `If there are people who at least want to listen to us, it's
very good,'' the Baltic republic's representative in Moscow,
Egidius Bickauskas, told a news conference after the meeting with
Alexander N. Yakovlev.

   Some 1.5 million households nationwide
received no census forms because the Census Bureau failed to print
post office box numbers on the mailings, officials said.
   Each form will have to be delivered by census workers to the
homes, instead of to the boxes, before the census can be completed,
Gail Kremenec, spokeswoman for the regional census office in the
Chicago suburb of Westchester, said Tuesday.
   Officials were unable to estimate the cost of the foul-up but
said they don't expect any significant delay in completing the 1990
census.
   About 106 million forms were mailed nationwide in the last week
of March. But forms destined for people who have their mail sent to
box numbers went out without the numbers, and the Postal Service
was unable to deliver them, census officials said.

   The government says it is finally getting a
handle on how many secrets it creates each year.
   Its best guess is that the ``top secret,'' ``secret'' and
``confidential'' stamps were wielded 6,796,501 times in the fiscal
year that ended last Sept. 30.
   That was a 35 percent decrease from the year before, but the
gains are somewhat illusory.
   ``It appears that this unprecedented drop is primarily the
result of more accurate counting, rather than an actual tremendous
decrease in classification activity,'' said Steven Garfinkel, head
of the Information Security Oversight Office, created in 1982 when
then-President Reagan rewrote all the rules for classifying
documents.

   The march toward national acceptance of a holiday honoring the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gathered up Kentucky, Wyoming and Idaho
recently, leaving only three states as holdouts today, 22 years
after King's death.
   ``I think it's shows that we are making headway,'' said Lloyd
Davis, executive director of the King Federal Holiday Commission.
   He expressed confidence that Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana
would not hold out much longer amid what he sees as dramatic
reverberations of King's non-violent philosophy as far away as the
Philippines, China, Poland and East Germany.
   ``What's happening around the world shows the universality of
King,'' Davis said in a recent telephone interview from Washington.

   Chinese are being warned not to wear black
armbands or white flowers of mourning on Thursday, the annual
holiday when Chinese honor their dead and a potential time for
anti-government protests.
   Chinese sources said today that some offices and factories in
Beijing were advising workers against displays of mourning on
Qingming, when Chinese traditionally sweep the graves of their
ancestors.
   The Beijing city government has issued orders that ban organized
group visits to cemeteries unless permission is received from

   Overseas dissident groups have called on students to ``stroll''
through Tiananmen Square on Thursday in a silent memorial to the
hundreds of people killed when the military crushed the

   President Bush is turning up pressure on
Congress to quickly enact his aid request for Panama and Nicaragua,
as the House-approved measure faces delay in the Senate.
   The House voted 362-59 Tuesday for a $2.4 billion spending bill
that provides $720 million for the two new Central American
democracies. The measure includes nearly $1.7 billion in other
spending, most of it for domestic programs such as disaster relief,
food stamps and Forest Service firefighting.
   The bill is partly funded by a $1.8 billion cut from the
Pentagon budget that amounts to the first use of a ``peace
dividend'' from lessened East-West military tensions.
   Bush called his appeal a ``laser-like request to help Panama and
Nicaragua,'' and State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said failure to pass the package quickly would threaten the
fledgling democracies and be like ``playing with dynamite.''

<HEAD>Prayer About Palestinians And Jews Packs Fireworks</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Something as seemingly innocent as a prayer apparently can be
explosive when involving the taut feelings of Palestinians and
Israel's Jews. That combustible mix has set off a Holy Week furor.
   It was ignited by a prayer prepared by the Middle East Council
of Churches and distributed to U.S. church leaders, along with the
council's request that it be read in Palm Sunday services this
weekend.
   The prayer ``seems to be extremely provocative, recalling the
worst uses of Christian Holy Week as a club against Jews,'' says
the Rev. Elliott Wright of the U.S. National Conference of
Christians and Jews.
   Protests also came from Jewish organizations. The Dutch Council
of Churches and Protestant churches in West Germany reportedly have
declined to approve use of the prayer.
   The Middle East Council of Churches, embracing heavily
Palestinian denominations, proposed this Sunday's prayer as the
start of a 50-day linking of world churches in prayers for Holy
Land peace, culminating on Pentecost June 1.
   The Rev. Gabriel Habib, the council's general secretary, said in
a letter presenting the plan:
   ``We hope that the solidarity in prayer ... will emphasize both
the tragedy of the situation _ the denial of the rights and dignity
of the Palestinian people _ and the faith that ... the grievous
wrongs can be righted. ...''
   As for wording of the opening prayer itself, it probably would
seem thoroughly innocuous to most Christians, even blandly typical,
at least on casual reading, but critics point out its stickier
connotations.
   It ``is a thinly veiled attack on the state of Israel in
liturgical form,'' said the American Jewish Committee, adding that
using the prayer ``would inject a divisive and polarizing element''
into Christian services.
   Wright, senior vice president of the National Conference of
Christians and Jews, which for a half century has worked for
interfaith partnership, said the prayer could ``cause
Jewish-Christian tensions in U.S. communities.''
   It is ``a carefully constructed, ideologically subtle
document,'' he added. ``Sentences and paragraphs do not always end
up where you think they are headed.''
   He said some consider the prayer ``a pro-Palestinian political
statement combined with a narrow, exclusive theological point of
view.''
   Rabbi A. James Rudin, the AJC's Interreligious Affairs director,
and the associate director, Judith H. Banki, said the prayer ``is
filled with mischievous inuendos.''
   Criticism of the 400-word prayer focused mainly on three
paragraphs, one of them dealing by implication with a Palestinian
state, but not specifying it, saying in part:
   ``We come to Jerusalem ... and we see ... that people remain in
agony and suffering. Strengthen those who ... have been deprived of
the right to live in dignity. ... Free them from oppression;
restore to them the right to life and to independence in their own
land. ...''
   Rubin and Ms. Banki said the wording ``makes the reckless and
unjustified claim that Palestinian Arabs are being deprived of
their `very right to life' by Israel.
   ``Such language implies that the physical destruction of the
Palestinian community is the goal of policy of Israel. This is a
malicious slander.''
   Another criticized paragraph refers by implication to Israelis
without naming them, saying in part:
   ``We come to Jerusalem ... and we see that there are those who
live in fear. ... Free them from the illusion that depriving others
of their rights, or even eliminating them, will provide security or
reaffirm self-identity. ...''
   The other criticized paragraph refers to Jerusalem itself and
projects its unity in ``one body,'' equated with Christianity,
saying:
   ``When we neet in you (Jerusalem) as one body ... carrying the
Good News, and when we bring to realization your justice on Earth,
then will Jerusalem become the community of all believers. ...''
   Rudin and Ms. Banki pointed out that many noted Christian
theologians have publicly repudiated such ``religious
triumphalism,'' and added:
   ``We strongly believe that Jeruslaem is today, in fact, a
community of all believers: Jewish, Christian and Moslem.''
   The proposed prayer was distributed in this country to heads of
denominations and to local ecumenical councils by the U.S. National
Council of Churches, including most major Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox bodies.
   But it stated in a covering memorandum that the material
``clearly reflects the perspective of the Middle East Council of
Churches,'' and was being sent at its request.
   Wright said it was uncertain whether U.S. denominations would
pass the text on to congregations, although indications were that
some local councils planned events around the prayer.
   ``I expect that everyone would agree that prayer is in order for
peace between Israelis and Palestinians,'' Wright said. ``Efforts
to counteract anti-Semitism in no way diminish concern for the
Palestinians and for a genuine and lasting peace in the area.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Missiles for Germany Obsolete, but Still on Drawing Board</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In private, the administration acknowledged
long ago that there is no realistic prospect for the deployment of
new short-range nuclear missiles in Germany. But the project
remains on the table, a devalued bargaining chip in arms control
talks abroad and budget negotiations at home.
   In both settings, rival negotiators know that the modernized
missile plan is obsolete. West Germany doesn't want the weapons
deployed on its soil, and that will go double in a reunified
Germany.
   On a redrawn, post-Cold War political map, they will be missiles
without logical targets anyhow. But the project remains in the
budget, at $112 million this year, and a total cost estimated by
the administration at $1.2 billion if it were to be completed.
   The weapon involved would be a missile called FOTL, because it
hasn't been issued a name of its own. FOTL means follow on to
Lance. The Lance is a short-range missile now deployed in Germany
and four other NATO nations; it will be obsolete by the middle of
the decade, and the alliance has been talking about modernization.
   The nuclear missiles were deployed to buttress outnumbered NATO
troops in the event of a Soviet ground attack into western Europe.
Modernizing that missile force was a contentious issue even before
the political upheavals that transformed eastern Europe toward
democracy, brought down the Berlin Wall and effectively dismantled
the old Soviet satellite empire.
   When President Bush went to his first NATO summit 10 months ago,
missile modernization was a problem. Bush proposed sharp cuts in
conventional forces, East and West, and the alliance avoided the
nuclear missile quandary by putting off a decision on modernization
until 1992.
   In addition, the 1989 NATO compromise calls for negotiations to
reduce the battlefield nuclear missiles _ but not to eliminate them
totally _ after there is East-West agreement on reduction of
conventional forces, and those cuts have started to take place.
   That shelved the question past the West German parliamentary
elections scheduled late this year. The compromise nearly a year
ago avoided an issue that would have been a problem for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl; anti-nuclear sentiment had been growing in West
Germany since the 1987 treaty to scrap intermediate-range missiles.
   That pact left the short-range missiles, defined as those with
ranges up to 310 miles, as the only ones in the NATO neighborhood,
and West Germany is the site for almost all of them.
   The current force of Lance missiles has a range of about 70
miles. NATO has 88 short-range nuclear missile launchers. The FOTL
project is to turn out missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads
up to 280 miles, with 1,000 of the weapons planned at an expected
total cost of $1.2 billion.
   But all of that was drafted for use against a communist bloc
that has been transformed. New governments in eastern Europe are
pressing for Soviet troop withdrawals, and President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has agreed to them. East Germans have elected a new
government shaped to hasten the process of reunification.
   The West Germans didn't want nuclear missiles on their soil
aimed at other Germans even when the presumed targets were in
communist territory. They certainly aren't going to accept them now.
   The Bush administration is said to be considering changes in the
plan for new short-range missiles, a topic that will have to be
dealt with when NATO defense ministers meet next month in Alberta,
Canada.
   There may not be many options short of dropping the whole notion.
   The chairmen of the armed services committees in both the House
and the Senate have said Congress won't appropriate more money for
weapons the West Germans won't accept.
   A study by defense experts and members of Congress in both
parties concludes that the modernization plan should be dropped.
That report, issued by the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute,
says the funds could be better used elsewhere in the defense budget.
   And the conservative, defense-oriented Heritage Foundation
advocates cancelling the missile program and relying on an
air-launched tactical missile to serve the battlefield purpose if
necessary.
   ``For one thing, German opposition to having this weapon on
German soil is mounting and may be near-universal,'' the Heritage
study concludes. ``For another, the NATO assumptions on which the
need for FOTL has been based are that NATO conventional forces are
inferior to the Warsaw Pact and that a clear front line exists
between two Germanies.
   ``Both assumptions probably will not be valid for long.''

<TEXT>
   When you set out to evaluate a mutual fund,
financial advisers say, it's useful to be aware that you are aiming
at a moving target.
   Certainly, a given fund you have in your sights may have been
traveling the same course, with the same stated objective, for a
long time _ with an extensive performance record to boast about.
   But many things about a fund remain subject to unpredictable
change _ its size and maneuvering ability, for example, or the
identity of people manning its helm.
   As a result, funds cannot automatically be presumed to be fixed
quantities with relatively interchangeable characteristics, the way
some other securities such as Treasury bills or bank certificates
of deposit can.
   This point was driven home late last month when Peter Lynch,
manager of the enormously successful Fidelity Magellan Fund,
announced plans to leave his job at the end of May.
   Though he has been running Magellan, the nation's largest mutual
fund with more than $13 billion in assets, since 1977, Lynch is
just 46 years old.
   It was easy for people in the money-management business to
assume that when you bought Magellan shares you got Lynch to manage
your money for some indefinite period of time. The resident star
was unquestionably a prime reason for the fund's allure.
   So when Lynch stepped down, pleading a desire to do other things
with his life that an ever-increasing work load wouldn't allow, it
naturally caused a lot of commotion and uncertainty.
   Because of Lynch's renown, this has been the most celebrated
case of its kind in recent memory. But it is hardly the only one.
   Fund history contains many instances of star managers _
sometimes running funds set up specifically to package their
reputed genius _ abruptly departing for other endeavors.
   Furthermore, that's just one of several ways in which a fund can
change important parts of its identity. Usually a fund prospectus
sets out limits to this sort of thing, by declaring that no
fundamental switch in philosophy or objective can be made without a
shareholder vote.
   But even given such strictures, changes of many types can happen
routinely. For example, Donoghue's Moneyletter of Holliston, Mass.,
recently deleted a couple of respected growth funds from its
recommended list because they had raised their sales charges from 3
percent to 4.75 percent.
   Though that kind of move may not concern existing shareholders
much, it could give pause to anyone making periodic new investments
in a fund. It is certainly worthy of note for anyone contemplating
a first-time purchase.
   What to do when a development as dramatic as Lynch's departure
comes along? Most experts agree it is a matter of individual cases
and preferences rather than blanket rules.
   For Magellan shareholders in particular, says the Boston-based
United &amp; Babson Investment Report, ``We suggest staying with it,
especially if you have been in the fund a while and thus would feel
a sharp tax bite if you switched.''
   United &amp; Babson's analysts recommend keeping a close watch on
the results achieved by Lynch's designated successor, Morris Smith,
who has chalked up a winning record running another, smaller
Fidelity fund.
   Meanwhile, investors have seen a live demonstration of an
enduring principle in mutual funds: The game can change even when
the name is the same.

<TEXT>
   It was a public relations coup that would have
made their late chairman proud.
   The editors at Forbes magazine tried to upstage competitor
Fortune this week by issuing a new and improved list of America's
biggest companies the same day Fortune trotted out its latest
edition of the venerable 500.
   It was the kind of rascality that made the late Malcolm Forbes
famous. He was no doubt smiling down on the effort, which the
Forbes staff managed to pull off before the magazine containing the
list was even off the presses.
   Not since Forbes parodied its other main competitor, Business
Week, by spoofing its cover for a 1987 issue on executive pay has
the business-mag competition produced such high jinks.
   Forbes spokesman Ray Healey must have had tongue in cheek when
he explained in a telephone interview that the simultaneous release
of dueling Forbes and Fortune lists was simply ``a coincidence.''
   Like it's pure accident when Time and Newsweek have the same
cover story on, say, Madonna.
   Healey, who handles press relations for Forbes magazine, was
able to get the jump on the competition through a combination of
slick packaging and logistical wizardry.
   First, the magazine distinguished its list of 500 big companies
with a so-called ``Super 50,'' described as the most powerful firms
over a broad spectrum.
   That was to differentiate the Forbes list from Fortune's, a list
of the 500 largest industrial firms ranked by sales. Forbes rated
all public companies _ retailers, financial services,
manufacturers, you name it _ by sales, profits, assets and stock
market value.
   Second, Healey crunched a version of the Forbes list on his
personal computer, copied it to a computer diskette and dispatched
press kits to the news media before the magazine was printed. The
information on the diskette could be dumped directly into a news
agency's computer system, eliminating the need to hand-punch the
data from the list.
   Fortune, filling the role of tortoise to Forbes' hare, sent
copies of the actual magazine to the press along with other facts
about the 500 in paper press releases.
   The result? Both lists got the ink their creators sought,
although perhaps not in the manner they envisioned. The Associated
Press, for instance, led its story on the lists by noting the
obvious competition between the two.
   At least they agreed on who's on first. General Motors Corp.,
the only company with more than $100 billion in annual sales, led
both the Fortune and the Forbes rankings.
   But you need more than fast footwork to make real news with a
list. While Forbes grabbed a headline with its nifty 50, Fortune is
sure to have the last laugh.
   ``Fortune has been at the 500 for years and years. It's part of
the language,'' observed Fortune Managing Editor Marshall Loeb.
   ``Forbes has been anxiously and eagerly trying to catch up with
us,'' he said. ``But frankly, I've never heard anyone in
conversation say, `We're part of the Forbes 500.'''
   The Fortune editor is exactly right. Once something is
established as a standard, it's hard to push aside. That's why we
still measure in feet, not meters, or why a coach advises a kid to
eat his Wheaties, not Total.
   It's not that the Forbes list is any less ambitious or
newsworthy than Fortune's. Forbes, in a sense, does more than
Fortune by measuring companies on four separate scales.
   It's just that for some lists the franchise is locked up.
Fortune has the 500. Business Week has its executive pay survey.
Forbes, for its part, has the richest 400 Americans. No substitutes
will do.
   Of course, that won't stop the list purveyors from purveying
more lists. It seems as if every other issue delivers a fresh
register for us to peruse.
   Some journalists would say the public is definitely overlisted,
but the appetite for such trivia appears insatiable. Malcolm
Forbes, himself, must share part of the blame for this lopsided
demand curve. He was the one at Forbes several years ago who
dreamed up the richest 400 _ against the vociferous protests of
some Forbes staffers, Healey notes.
   Three decades after Fortune spawned the list business with its
first 500, news magazines have turned the ranking of the biggest
and richest into a cottage industry _ and lists have become the
Doritos of business journalism.
   So crunch all you want. They'll make more.

<HEAD>Around Country, No Sign Drug Abuse is Abating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news from the nation's capital was
somewhat encouraging _ fewer people taken into police custody
tested positive for cocaine. But around the country, law
enforcement officials say they see no sign that drug abuse and
trafficking are abating.
   The situation is ``bleak in that cocaine is still readily
available in the United States despite very significant and very
effective law enforcement initiatives both domestically and in
Latin America,'' said Frank Shults, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Agency.
   A DEA survey last September and October revealed that the price
of cocaine at the kilogram level has increased slightly, moving
from $13,000 to $14,000 in Los Angeles, he said.
   Unfortunately, he said, this doesn't mean there's a cocaine
shortage.
   ``We attribute it to price gouging at low- and mid-level
trafficking, and individuals who are taking advantage of the user's
fear of a shortage,'' Shults said.
   He said the fear stems from some significant law enforcement
advances:
   _The Colombian government's crackdown on drug trafficking has
disrupted operations of the Medellin cartel.
   _The price of coca leaf paid to farmers in Bolivia and Peru has
dropped to $5 to $10 per hundred pounds, far below the growers'
break-even point of $30 per hundred pounds. The price drop occurred
because of the Colombian crackdown, an oversupply of leaf, more
efficient processing techniques and better controls of chemicals
used to make cocaine, he said.
   _The seizure of 20 tons of cocaine at one Los Angeles warehouse
in the fall, combined with several other major busts around the
country.
   Nevertheless, the purity of cocaine at the kilo level has
remained high, approximately 84 percent, throughout the United
States, Shults said. At the street level, there has been a slight
decrease in purity, but officials attribute that also to a
perception of a shortage rather than an actual one.
   As it turned out, the decline in the percentage of Washington
D.C. arrestees who tested positive for cocaine was temporary.
Justice Department and local officials said the temporary drop may
be attributed in part to the arrest of one major trafficker and the
disruption of his operation.
   Law enforcement efforts have changed drug dealers' tactics, but
there is no nationwide trend, police officials say.
   In some areas, crack houses have given way to open air markets
to reduce the amount of drugs and money that police can seize in a
single bust.
   In East St. Louis, Ill., for example, drugs were sold a few
years ago primarily at homes known to locals as drug emporiums, and
all deals were done behind closed doors, according to the chief of
detectives, Lester Anderson.
   Now, he said, money and drugs are exchanged onstreet corners in
broad daylight, known there as ``curb service.''
   Even in Los Angeles, where crack houses once dominated the
market for that drug, there has been a slight and recent trend
toward deals on the street, said Sgt. Tim Beard of the county
sheriff's narcotics unit. The reason: to avoid detection and to
implicate as few people as possible in the event of a bust,
   But the reverse has happened elsewhere.
   In Washington D.C., law enforcement officials said dealers have
closed some open air markets to avoid easy arrest.
   In Dallas, on-the-street drug trafficking today is not as
blatant as in past years when dealers were ``standing on the
streets waving down customers,'' said Capt. Doug Kolwalski, who
heads the police department's narcotics division.
   Efforts by officials to increase public awareness and encourage
neighbors to report drug dealing have paid off, he said. As a
result, drug dealers have become more discreet.
   The same is happening in New York City where ``dealers are
becoming more selective in who they sell to,'' said Capt. Robert
Cividanes of the police narcotics division.
   ``Many move to off-street locations and employ ``steerers,'' the
captain said.
   In Broward County, Fla., ``We're seeing smaller quantities on
the street because the police are catching these people and the
dealers don't want to lose large quantities,'' said Robert Deak,
commander of the county's drug task force.
   Deak said dealers are adjusting their sales techniques depending
on law enforcement tactics.
   ``As we do more of the sweeps, they do tend to move inside the
buildings,'' he said. ``But as we do search warrants, they move out
of buildings.''
   John Rothlein, commander of the Metro Dade police narcotics
unit, described the ebb and flow of drug markets as ``a cat and
mouse game.''
   In Denver, Capt. Rudy Sandoval of the police vice and narcotics
bureau said, ``We've still got crack houses, but they're
underground. They're not on the street bothering people like they
used to.''
   The street drug market in New Orleans has changed, but the
overall situation hasn't improved, said Capt. Chuck Ladell, chief
of detectives.
   ``There are more of them now but they are more discreet,''
Ladell said.
   Despite some increases in prices for kilos of cocaine, street
prices have remained relatively stable, averaging $100 a gram
nationwide, police said.
   Denver had some good news for those who believe cocaine use has
at least stopped growing.
   Dr. Stephen Dilts, director of emergency alcohol, drug and
psychiatric treatment at Denver General Hospital, said the number
of patients showing up in the emergency room with cocaine-related
problems appears to be leveling off after years of steadily
increasing.
   ``Over the past few years, we've seen an increase in the number
of cocaine addicts, but no particular increase in the last year,''
Dilts said.

   Fortune and Forbes magazines found one thing
they could agree on, proclaiming General Motors Corp. the nation's
largest public company in two dueling lists of America's corporate
titans.
   The Fortune 500 list, the annual ranking familiar on Main Street
as well as Wall Street, on Tuesday ranked the nation's largest
industrial firms by sales. The Forbes ranking included all public
companies measured by sales, profits, assets and stock market value.
   GM was on top either way, with nearly $127 billion in sales and
$4.2 billion in earnings during 1989.

   OPEC nations held oil production steady
in March but remained more than a million barrels a day above their
self-imposed supply cap, according to estimates.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped a total
of about 23.7 million barrels a day in March, the same as in the
previous month, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said
Tuesday.
   Sales of OPEC crude oil in March were believed to be lower than
production due to apparent excess supply of heavy, sour grades and
weaker than expected demand from refiners, the group stated.

   General Motors Corp. was the titan of corporate
America last year despite tough foreign competition and cutthroat
rebates that squeezed the nation's Big Three automakers, according
to Fortune and Forbes magazines.
   With nearly $127 billion in sales and $4.2 billion in earnings
in 1989, GM garnered first place on the Fortune 500 and Forbes
``Super 50'' lists, released Tuesday.
   The Fortune 500, as familiar on Main Street as on Wall Street,
ranks the nation's largest industrial firms by sales. Forbes ranks
all public companies by sales, profits, assets and stock market
value.
   Both magazines have issued 500 rankings for years, but Tuesday
was the first time in recent memory that the lists were released
the same day. In an effort to upstage its competitor, Forbes topped
its rankings with a so-called Super 50, which it described as the
most powerful companies across all four categories.
   The Fortune 500 had a profit decline in 1989 after years of
strong growth, reflecting the slowdown in industrial America.
   Behind GM, Fortune's top 10 were: Ford Motor Co., Exxon Corp.,
International Business Machines Corp., General Electric Co., Mobil
Corp., Philip Morris Cos., Chrysler Corp., E.I. du Pont de Nemours
&amp; Co., and Texaco Inc.
   Rounding out the top 10 of the Forbes Super 50 were: GE, Exxon,
IBM, Ford, Philip Morris, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.,
Mobil, Du Pont and Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   The Fortune 500 list appears in the April 23 edition and is
available on newsstands Wednesday. Forbes released its ranking two
weeks before it is to hit the stands in the April 30 edition.
   ``It's a horse race every year,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray
Healey, describing his magazine's rush to beat its rival.
``Information of this kind is old in a matter of minutes. As soon
as we have it locked in solid, we send it out.''
   Marshall Loeb, Fortune managing editor, dismissed the
competition.
   ``Fortune has been at the 500 for years and years. It's part of
the language. I've never heard anyone in conversation say, `We're
part of the Forbes 500.'''
   Fortune 500 sales jumped 7 percent to a record $2.16 trillion in
1989, but overall earnings fell 8.2 percent to $105.6 billion. In
the previous two years, profits among the big manufacturers had
climbed an unprecedented 79 percent.
   Median profits fell in nine of Fortune's 27 industry groups and
only 264 of the top 500 companies had earnings growth, down from
327 in 1988.
   Pharmaceuticals had the largest median increase in earnings, up
19.6 percent; followed by beverages, 18.3 percent; textiles, 15.3
percent; food, 14 percent; and electronics 10 percent.
   The motor vehicles and parts industry suffered the largest
median earnings decline, down 25 percent, followed by aerospace,
down 12.5 percent; petroleum refining, down 11.8 percent;
transportation equipment, down 9.4 percent; and computers, down 9
percent.
   Fortune said six of the 10 largest industrial companies suffered
double-digit earnings declines, including a 66 percent drop at
Chrysler, whose ranking dropped a notch from 1988.
   Despite topping Forbes' earnings list, GM's profits fell 13
percent last year. Ford's profits fell 28 percent in 1989 to $3.84
billion but still ranked as the third highest after GM and General
Electric, Forbes said.
   ``In the 1960s and 1970s, back before global competition became
so intense and incessant, the earnings of the 500 companies
invariably rose as long as the domestic economy was growing. Not
any more,'' Fortune said.
   Foreign competition, especially from the Japanese, was
particularly acute in the motor vehicles and parts industry, which
ranked as the poorest performer by nearly every measure of
profitability, according to Fortune. That sector also was hurt by
high interest rates and rebates.
   GM had by far the largest profit during 1989, while No. 46 Sun
Co., an energy business, had the biggest profit jump, up 1,300
percent.
   Maxxam Inc., an alumunium products and lumber company which
soared to 184th place from 485th, had the biggest sales increase,
up 366.7 percent, according to Fortune.
   Another big jump occurred because of Time Inc.'s acquisition of
Warner Communications Inc. for $14 billion. The combined Time
Warner _ Fortune's parent company _ jumped from No. 102 to No. 59.
   Foreign takeovers bumped several companies off the list. Among
the casualties were SmithKline Beckman Corp., which merged with
Britain's Beecham Group PLC in an $8 billion deal; Pillsbury Co.,
bought for $5.8 billion by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC; and
Combustion Engineering Inc., acquired by Swiss giant ABB Asea Brown
Boveri.
   Among the 39 newcomers were Lyondell Petrochemical, which
debuted at 93rd on the Fortune 500 list.

   Forbes magazine has taken a shot at competitor
Fortune with a new list that Forbes claims more accurately ranks
the most powerful American corporations.
   Dubbed the ``Super 50,'' the Forbes list ranks the biggest U.S.
companies based on their ``across-the-board strength'' in sales,
profits, assets and the market value of their stock.
   The new list was introduced on Tuesday, the same day Fortune
released its venerable 500 list.
   Forbes derided the Fortune list _ which is limited to industrial
companies ranked by sales alone _ as ``one-dimensional.''
   It claimed the Super 50 best identified the companies _
financial as well as industrial _ with ``the capital, the resources
and the financial stamina to compete in world markets.''
   ``It's a horse race every year,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray
Healey, describing his magazine's effort to compete with Fortune.
   He said the release of both lists on the same day was a
coincidence.
   The Super 50 is a new wrinkle in Forbes' own 500 ranking, which
the magazine has issued annually. Forbes measures all public
companies four different ways, by sales, profits, assets and market
value.
   General Motors Corp. topped the Super 50, placing first among
all U.S. companies in both sales and profits. GM also topped the
Fortune 500.
   Below is a ranking of the Super 50 followed by figures for the
companies' sales, profits, assets and market value in millions of

<HEAD>Digital Unveils New RISC Workstation, Aggressive Pricing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. launched an
assault on the computer industry's hottest market, introducing its
most powerful workstations, slashing prices on other models and
vowing to take the lead in ``open'' systems.
   Digital showed off over 20 new computers, peripherals and
software products Tuesday, including a 3D desktop workstation it
claimed is the industry's highest performing model.
   The Maynard, Mass.-based company is playing catchup in
RISC-based workstations and systems based on non-proprietary,
``open'' operating software, but it took a feisty stand in the
first major product announcement at its Silicon Valley facility.
   In addition to price cuts on its entire family of RISC-based
workstations _ the cheapest is now $5,950 _ along with servers and
ULTRIX software, the company said it has improved discounts and
will offer finder's fees for third-party sales.
   ``All of this reinforces our primary message,'' said Donald
Gaubatz, Digital's group manager for workstations. ``We intend to
be number one in the open systems market, and we are doing what it
takes to achieve that goal.''
   Wall Street apparently liked what it heard and sent Digital's
recently depressed shares up $2.50 to $79.62. The price was over
$100 last fall.
   Sales of workstations _ powerful desktop computers _ are
expected to grow 35 percent this year to $8.1 billion, according to
San Jose-based Dataquest Inc.
   Leading companies like Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co., Digital, and big newcomer International Business Machines
Corp. have been bringing out new models and cutting prices relative
to performance.
   That's good news for the businesses, banks and engineering
companies that are the main buyers of workstations.
   ``This market is going to be hotly competitive for a very long
time,'' said Barry Willman, an analyst with New York-based Sanford
C. Bernstein &amp; Co., who attended Digital's introduction.
   ``The companies are prepared to aggressively defend the
installed base they've already developed and are aggressively
focused on building that base,'' he said, adding that Digital
appears to be embarking on a price war.
   ``Given how aggressively Digital was comparing themselves to
H-P, Sun and IBM, I would expect those other vendors not to be
silent in the face of that attack,'' he said.
   Digital's pursuit of market share comes at a time when it also
needs to bolster profits. Analysts predict the company's revenues
for the fiscal year ending June 30 will barely exceed last year's
$12.7 billion, and earnings will drop for the second year in a row
_ this time by 70 percent.
   The new products, most of which are ready for shipment, aren't
expected to have an impact on revenues until the 1991 fiscal year.
The company has been cutting overhead with a severance program
aimed at reducing its 126,000 employees by 8,000.
   Until last year Digital was ambivalent about its commitment to
open industry standards such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s Unix software and RISC, or reduced instruction set computers.
   Now, the company says that segment of its business will soon
match its VAX workstations and proprietary VMS software lines.
   Domenic LaCava, Digital's vice president for low end systems,
said the company expects ``incremental'' growth in its VAX
workstation business and that ``over time the ratio of RISC
workstations to VAX workstations will level out.''
   ``Over this next year we should see something approaching
50-50,'' he said. ``The RISC line is starting to take off
dramatically. We have seen the order rate double and triple in
weekly orders over the last three or four months.''
   Computer hardware analyst Kevin Landis of Dataquest was
impressed but not overwhelmed by the capabilities of Digital's new
5000 series workstations, which start at $14,995.
   ``It doesn't cleanly leapfrog everybody but it's good,'' said
Landis. ``It's a significant step for them to go to open systems
and step away from their traditional line. They're making a lot of
tough choices. It represents a strategic leap for them.''
   Willman said the new computers, peripherals and software
``significantly broaden their product line from a performance
standpoint and also significantly improve their price
competitiveness in the market.''
   Digital cites research by International Data Corp., in
Framingham, Mass., that shows Digital is only slightly behind
workstation market leader Sun Microsystems and ahead of
Hewlett-Packard, which recently bought Apollo Computer Inc.
   Dataquest's Kathleen Hurley says Digital holds just under 20
percent of the market and is third behind Hewlett-Packard.
   In any event, all of the big three workstation leaders have to
contend with a potentially invasive rival _IBM.
   IBM last month brought out a line of workstations it said would
snare a major share of a market in which it never had success.
   The machines, called the RISC System-6000, represented the first
time IBM has wholeheartedly embraced the Unix operating system.

<HEAD>New GM Management Team Product Heavy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half of the new core management team at General
Motors Corp. comes from the product-side of the automobile
business, a change that should help the company rebuild its market
share, analysts say.
   The team, led by Chairman-elect Robert Stempel, takes control
Aug. 1, the day after Roger B. Smith retires as GM's 10th chairman,
Smith said Tuesday.
   Stempel, now the company's president, also will become its chief
executive officer in August.
   ``I think Mr. Stempel will take a very hands on interest in the
North American turnaround,'' said auto analyst Scott Merlis of
Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. of New York. ``There will be a lot of
continuity in that.''
   Smith, who became chairman on New Year's Day 1981, and Stempel,
who became president on Sept. 1, 1987, have worked closely over the
past few years, trying to fend off an assault by arch-rival Ford
Motor Co. and Japanese companies on the company's North American
market share.
   Stempel said Tuesday that defending and recapturing the lost
share was his top goal.
   ``There is no higher priority in General Motors than increasing
our market share profitably,'' he said.
   Joining Stempel, 56, in top leadership positions will be:
   _Lloyd Reuss, 53, executive vice president in charge of North
American Auto Operations. He will succeed Stempel as president.
   _John F. Smith, 51, executive vice president in charge of GM's
international operations. He will become one of two vice chairmen.
   _Robert J. Schultz, 59, GM's executive vice president in charge
of the company's GM Hughes Electronics Corp., Electronic Data
Systems Corp. and GM's technical staffs. He will become the other
vice chairman.
   No one will assume Stempel's title as chief operating officer.
There currently are no GM vice chairmen.
   ``In a sense, this whole thing is kind of a reassignment of
titles,'' said auto analyst David Healy of the brokerage
Barclays-BZW in New York. ``I think it's probably notable for how
little change there is rather than how much.
   ``It's also notable that it is product guys rather than
financial types or marketing types who really have pretty much all
the top jobs now,'' he added.
   ``I thought it was very important to have this organization,''
Stempel said of his team, ``and recognize the importance I attach
personally to our technical operation, EDS and Hughes, and
worldwide operations ... and then of course the strength we have in
North America.''
   During the nine years of Smith's reign, GM's share of the North
American car and truck market has fallen to 34.6 percent at the end
of last year from 44.1 percent in 1980.
   But there are other problems Stempel must tackle immediately.
   ``I guess the one thing that one has to do if one is ascending
to the top of GM is lower expectations,'' said analyst Joseph
Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. ``Bob (Stempel)
hasn't got any magic bullet that he can whip out of his holster and
point and solve the problem of market share.
   ``What he's going to have to do is set a leadership tone that is
going to get that organization turned around.''
   A key to GM's hopes for market share recovery is its
much-ballyhooed Saturn Corp. The division is scheduled to begin
production this summer in Spring Hill, Tenn., of a compact car
aimed directly at Japanese models.
   The $3-billion project also is serving as a laboratory for new
manufacturing and labor relations techniques.
   But perhaps the most significant test in Stempel's first days as
chairman will be this summer's negotiations with the United Auto
Workers.
   ``We remind Mr. Stempel that GM's single most valuable resource
is a capable and dedicated work force that seeks to build the best
products it is capable of building,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and
Vice President Stephen Yokich, head of the union's GM Department,
said in a statement.
   Merlis and other analysts have long urged GM to look to its
successful European operations for leads in turning around its
North American business.
   Stempel joined GM in 1958 as a senior detailer in the Oldsmobile
Division's chassis design department. He rose through the ranks in
Oldsmobile and Pontiac until he was appointed managing director of
Adam Opel AG in West Germany.
   ``The key message here is that GM has a five-month (new car)
waiting list in Europe and has nothing but product successes
there,'' Merlis said. ``Now your chairman and vice chairman (John
Smith) have had experience in Europe.
   ``They're well positioned to cross-fertilize the lessons learned
overseas to North America.''

<HEAD>Stockholder Vote Called Censorship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shareholder upset by ``The Last Temptation
of Christ'' is urging other holders of MCA Inc. stock to tell the
company not to make films that might offend religious groups.
   The proposal was included in proxy materials sent to
shareholders this week ahead of a vote at the company's annual
meeting May 8 in Chicago.
   A supporting statement for the proposal says ``Last Temptation''
showed Jesus as a ``disturbed man who frequents brothels,
hallucinates seeing snakes, vows that he always tells lies, acts
only as a result of fear...and feels tormented by God.''
   The proposal, made by stockholder Dean Shahinian of Alexandria,
Va., calls for shareholders to censure MCA for ``anti-Christian
effects.''
   ``We urge management to establish a corporate policy not to use
corporate assets to falsely defame Jesus Christ or other major
religious leaders,'' it says.
   MCA urged shareholders to reject the proposal, saying that
censoring a film because it contains an unconventional religious
viewpoint could stifle religious and creative expression.
   Noting that Martin Scorsese won a best director Oscar nomination
for ``Temptation,'' MCA said the film was Scorsese's interpretation
of a novel, not the company's view of Christ.
   The proxy materials also disclosed that MCA's top executives
were awarded hefty compensation last year.
   Film chief Thomas Pollock was given MCA stock worth $5.7 million
in 1989 and stock options worth $7.8 million when issued last
August.
   Pollock also was paid a base salary of $627,000, bringing his
total compensation to more than $14 million. His salary was raised
to $850,000 this year.
   Sidney Sheinberg, president of the Universal City-basedmovie,
TV, music and theme park giant, was issued stock worth $7.2 million
last year. His salary jumps from $729,000 in 1989 to $900,000. MCA
Chairman Lew Wasserman's salary also jumps to $900,000 from
$559,000.
   The shareholders will vote on a new stock option plan under
which Pollock was given his options.
   The plan authorizes the issuance of 5 million new shares,
600,000 of which would become available to Pollock at $55 a share
over the next five years. He may exercise 20 percent of the options
once per year, beginning this July.
   MCA's stock was trading at $68 a share when they were awarded
last August. It has since fallen in value, closing at $50.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. At that level, Pollock would lose
money by exercising his options.
   MCA's last stock option plan was approved in 1968 but never
exercised. The company said the new plan was needed to provide
competitive compensation for MCA executives.
   That was a reference to corporations like the Walt Disney Co.,
whose Chairman President Frank Wells made $72.4 million on the sale
of stock bought through options in 1989.

   Here are the key provisions of clean air
legislation passed by the Senate.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Urban Smog</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Requires states and local authorities to develop pollution
control plans to reduce urban smog and bring air quality in more
than 100 cities within federal health standards. Timetable for
meeting the standards ranged from five to 15 years, with Los
Angeles getting 20 years because of the severity of its problem.
   Smog-causing pollutants, or ozone, are reduced through controls
on automobiles and industry, with annual pollution improvements of
4 percent a year required over first six years.
   Automobiles:
   _Tougher tailpipe emission requirements by 1995 cutting
hydrocarbon releases by 22 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by
66 percent.
   _Cleaner fuels for all automobiles in nine cities with the worst
pollution. The nine cities are Los Angeles, Houston, New York City,
Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, Conn., San Diego and
Chicago.
   _Special canisters on auto fuel systems to reduce emissions
during refueling.
   Industrial Sources:
   _Sources emitting 100 tons of smog-causing pollutants must
install new smog control technology, although a waiver may be given
in some cases if pollution control costs exceed $5,000 per ton.
   Current Law: Requires controls on tailpipe emissions, but curbs
widely believed to be inadequate to meet air quality standards amid
growing number of cars on the road. Despite law, more than 100
cities fail to meet federal air quality standards.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Toxic Chemicals</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Requires industrial plants to install best available technology
to control the release of about 200 hazardous chemicals linked to
cancer, nervous disorders and birth defects. That affects a wide
range of industries including oil refineries, chemical plants,
smelters, dry cleaners and paint shops.
   The EPA now regulates only seven chemicals.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Acid Rain</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Requires annual sulfur dioxide releases to be reduced by 10
million tons by 2000, roughly cutting such emissions in half.
   It allows utilities to buy and sell ``pollution credits'' among
themselves as long as total reductions in emissions are not
affected. Extra allowances are given to Midwest utilities and some
``clean'' plants to ease the cost burden and allow for future
growth.
   Nitrogen oxide releases, which also contribute to acid rain,
must be cut by 2.7 million tons.
   It will affects 107 coal-fired electric power plants with
Midwest utilities using high-sulfur coal facing greatest pollution
reduction burden and likely increases in electric rates.
   Current law: Utilities must comply with local air quality
requirements, but have avoided curbs on sulfur dioxide emissions by
building tall smokestacks that send the pollution high into the
atmosphere. Pollutants are carried hundreds of miles and fall as
acid rain.

<TEXT>
   The first state to ban indoor smoking except
for designated areas is now taking the lead nationally in trying to
snuff out cigarette machines _ or at least keep them out of
youngsters' reach.
   Since the St. Paul suburb of White Bear Lake passed the state's
first ban on cigarette vending machines in October, at least 20
other Minnesota cities have prohibited or restricted the machines.
   The restrictions are part of a grass-roots movement for a
smoke-free society, said Jean Forster, assistant professor in the
University of Minnesota's School of Public Health.
   ``It's captured the imagination of local communities,'' she
said. ``It's something they can do at their level. There are a lot
of places watching what's happening in Minnesota.''
   A measure pending in Congress, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken,
D-Ohio, would ban cigarette machines in any location accessible to
people under 18.
   Testimony at a hearing last year cited a National Automatic
Merchandising Association report that only 2.5 percent of teen-age
smokers buy their cigarettes from machines.
   But advocates of cigarette machine bans say any percentage is
significant.
   ``It may not stop kids from smoking, but it puts another
roadblock in the way,'' said White Bear Lake Mayor Jerry Briggs.
   A few other states and communities outside Minnesota have
instituted or are considering cigarette machine bans. But Angela
Mickel, director of the Tobacco-Free America Legislative
Clearinghouse in Washington, D.C., said the local campaigns in
Minnesota are the most widespread she's seen.
   ``Minnesota is looked at as a leader in health advocacy,'' she
said.
   In 1975, the state passed the nation's first Clean Indoor Air
Act. The law restricting indoor smoking was a model for laws across
the country.
   White Bear Lake and Bloomington are among at least eight
Minnesota cities banning cigarette machines altogether.
   Others have enacted softer restrictions. Redwood Falls bans the
machines from ``public places.'' Preston restricts them to places
licensed to sell liquor. Excelsior requires that machines be under
constant supervision by employees.
   The local measures were almost nullified last month when
Minnesota lawmakers considered a proposal that would have
overridden local restrictions for the sake of consistent statewide
regulation.
   The bill that passed instead preserves local governments' power
to ban the machines while tightening restrictions statewide.
   That measure, which awaits Gov. Rudy Perpich's signature,
requires electronic locks on machines that a business's employees
can activate and requires that the machines be kept where workers
can monitor their use.
   Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, a
Washington trade association for cigarette manufacturers, said the
tobacco industry has taken no position on the matter. ``It's an
issue that pertains to the vendors,'' he said.
   But he added that the bans are no surprise. ``Minnesota has a
certain history of being receptive to any anti-smoking
initiative,'' Merryman said.
   The vending machine industry argued unsuccessfully before state
lawmakers that minors can be protected without a ban.
   ``We're looking for uniformity,'' said Tom Briant, lawyer for
the Minnesota Coalition for Responsible Vending Sales. ``We think
it would be in the public interest to regulate it on a statewide
basis.''
   Briant said about 275 people could lose their jobs by allowing
bans throughout the state. But anti-smoking activists say bans are
the only way to keep minors from buying cigarettes from vending
machines.
   Jordan Cushing, a 16-year-old Minneapolis sophomore, said she
knows many teen-agers whose addiction began by purchasing
cigarettes from machines.
   ``It's really, really easy,'' said Cushing, who has worked with
anti-smoking groups. ``If the machines are taken away, it would
make a big difference.''
   She said any potential loss of jobs is outweighed by health
concerns. ``Their main argument is money, but these are lives,
lives that haven't really even had the chance to get started,'' she
said.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
European trading this morning.
   Gold was lower in thin and aimless trading.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 158.90 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar traded at 158.75 yen.
   The dollar started higher following overnight gains in New York,
but the currency gradually fell in Tokyo as market players _ mainly
life insurance and securities houses _ sold the dollar against the
yen in an attempt to reduce their dollar holdings ahead of the
meeting of the Group of Seven key currency nations scheduled for
April 7 in Paris, said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Market players began to reduce their dollar holdings in case
the G-7 meeting comes up with something they had not predicted,
although nothing special is expected at the moment,'' he said.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's

<HEAD>Stocks Lose Ground, Dollar Drops Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index erased its
morning gains and fell back sharply in the afternoon, while the
dollar declined marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average ended trading down 316.78
points, or 1.10 percent, at 28,442.94.
   After reversing its 212.05-point morning gain, the index dropped
steeply during the afternoon, then narrowed its deficit by about
350 points with a rally in the last 20 minutes of trading, helped
in part by arbitrage buying, traders said.
   A Nomura Securities trader attributed the index's afternoon fall
to broad declines in speculative shares that triggered selling of
other issues, and to profit-taking from shares that had advanced in
the past week. The trader spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Prompted by growing concern that some speculators may be in
financial trouble, the Nikkei index fell quickly as investors tried
to get rid of speculative shares, including some local bank issues,
he said.
   Betty Wu, an analyst with SBCI Securities Asia Ltd., said the
afternoon's drop resulted in part from index selling, as
individuals were trying to curb their losses.
   She predicted relatively quiet trading in the next few weeks
because corporations have just closed their books on fiscal 1989,
which ended March 31, and are deciding future investment strategies.
   Trading was thin today, with volume on the market's first
section estimated at 560 million shares, down from Tuesday's 650
million.
   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index gained 757.65 points, following
Monday's drop of 1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, in the index's
second-largest single-day decline. The plunge followed a
1,045.71-point fall in the index last Friday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 158.90 yen, down 0.05
yen from Tuesday's close of 158.95 yen. It opened higher at 159.62
yen and ranged between 158.70 yen and 159.70 yen.
   The dollar started higher following overnight gains in New York,
but the currency gradually fell in Tokyo as market players _ mainly
life insurance and securities houses _ sold the dollar against the
yen in an attempt to reduce their dollar holdings ahead of the
meeting of the Group of Seven key currency nations scheduled for
April 7 in Paris, said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   ``Market players began to reduce their dollar holdings in case
the G-7 meeting comes up with something they had not predicted,
although nothing special is expected at the moment,'' he said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno is to leave for the meeting
in Paris on Friday.
   Some investors also sold the dollar for profit-taking, Tabata
said.
   ``But the yen's strength is likely to last only temporarily,''
he added.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the U.S. currency rose in New York overnight
because of speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has halted
its support for the yen in an attempt to pressure Japan to make
trade concessions in talks with the United States now under way in
Washington.
   ``The rumor has been in the market for some time, and it was
brought up again in New York. Such speculation has been already
factored into the market here,'' the Bank of Tokyo dealer said.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed
at 86.45 points, down from Tuesday's close at 86.51. Their yield
rose to 7.260 percent from Tuesday's 7.245 percent.

   Natural gas futures were traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange for the first time in what analysts termed a
light but successful session.
   About 920 contracts for future delivery of natural gas traded
hands during Tuesday's initial session.
   The volume was far below the 50,000 to 70,000 crude oil futures
traded daily on the exchange, but analysts said the important
traders were there.
   ``There certainly was trade participation, which is important in
a new contract,'' said Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst in
New York with E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures Inc.
   ``Everybody in the industry was watching it and I think it's
going to be a successful contract,'' he said.
   The contract for June delivery of natural gas traded from $1.58
to $1.655 during the session and settled at $1.635 per million
British thermal units.
   Futures contracts are used by producers and consumers of raw
commodities to hedge against financial risk by locking in prices in
advance. Speculators also play futures markets in hopes of
profiting from the constant change in prices.

<TEXT>
   Atlanta-based Contel Corp. said it planned a
major restructuring of its telephone operations division that could
eliminate about 600 jobs across the country.
   The cutbacks, which represent about 4 percent of Contel's
telephone operations staff, will take place over the next two
years. They are expected to be achieved largely through attrition
and voluntary separation programs.
   Under the restructuring plan, Contel said it would combine the
telephone operations from three regions and 12 divisions into six
multistate operating groups reporting directly to headquarters.
   The restructuring centralizes policy setting and allows
decisions to be made at the local level, said Brian Farley, a
Contel spokesman.
   Although Contel has not determined the cost of employee
separation programs, Farley said the company does not expect the
restructuring to have an impact on financial results.

<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Development Corp., mired in legal and
financial problems, is closing its global network of home-site
sales offices.
   General Development announced Tuesday it was shutting 24 offices
in this country, as well as bureaus in Europe, Canada and the Far
East, and laying off about 1,100 workers.
   The company is trying to stay out of bankruptcy court and
recover from a scandal involving a scheme to sell overpriced homes.
   Thomas D. Wood, a Coral Gables-based mortgage banker and
attorney, was named Tuesday to examine General Development's
agreement to reimburse nearly 10,000 victims of the overpricing
scheme. The agreement was part of a settlement of federal fraud
charges against the firm.
   U.S. District Court Judge Lenore Nesbitt said Wood's role was to
make the restitution pact ``acceptable, workable and realistic.''
   General Development said the closure of its offices would not
affect the restitution plan.
   ``The cost of generating sales in these offices no longer makes
economic sense,'' said company president Charles Simons. ``Also,
given the parameters of the proposed consent decree, we are not
confident that those guidelines are being met on a daily basis in
many of our offices.''
   The company will continue to sell existing homes at its nine
Florida communities, the focus of the U.S. attorney's office
two-year probe into pricing practices.
   A federal indictment accused the company and two former
executives of an elaborate scheme to sell homes with highly
inflated prices compared with similar Florida dwellings. The
victims _ many from the Northeast and Midwest _ were deceived into
purchasing homes an average of 40 percent higher than market value,
prosecutors said.
   A week after the March 16 indictment, attorneys for General
Development entered a guilty plea to one fraud count that could
bring a maximum $500,000 fine.
   At the same hearing, General Development's former president
Robert Ehrling and former chairman David Brown also pleaded guilty
to one fraud count. Each faces a maximum of five years in prison, a
$250,000 fine and some restitution payments. Sentencing is
scheduled for May 22.
   The plan, which still needs final court approval, covers General
Development homebuyers from Jan. 1, 1983, to Jan. 1, 1989, and
establishes a complicated formula to determine how much money will
be returned.
   A court-appointed master will set the restitution amount by
determining the difference between each home's net price and
appraised value.
   In cases of cash purchases, for example, the difference would be
paid in installments over 25 years. For those with a mortgage
through the company's financial division, the company would offset
a portion of the monthly payment.
   Under the plan, General Development would pay restitution up to
$2.5 million a year for the first five years, and a smaller portion
later. It would also be required to put up collateral valued at
$12.5 million by July 1.
   Discussions of restitution are complicated by cash shortages at
General Development, which announced Monday that negotiations for
$60 million in short-term credit fell apart and it might seek
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Moscowitz and company spokesman
Otis Wragg III declined to comment on how a bankruptcy filing would
affect the restitution program.
   Meanwhile, General Development is the target of several
burgeoning class-action suits stemming from the overpricing scheme
and conditions in the Florida communities. In Delaware, a major
shareholder has filed suit seeking to oust six company directors.

<HEAD>Icahn Says Divided USX Worth 35 Percent More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn says spinning
off USX Corp.'s steel division would increase shareholders' returns
by about 29 percent.
   The New York financier told stockholders in a letter Tuesday he
estimated that shares in a separate energy company would be worth
$39 while stock in a steel unit would be worth $9.
   USX's stock closed Tuesday at $37.12{ a share, up $1.50 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   USX spokesman William Keslar declined to comment on the letter
today, saying the company was studying it.
   Icahn, the largest stockholder of USX with 34 million shares or
13.29 percent, has asked the shareholders for a non-binding vote on
a proposal to spin off the steel division and call the new company
U.S. Steel.
   Four-fifths of the new company would become a dividend to USX
shareholders, who also would own Marathon Oil Co. and smaller USX
interests.
   The rest of the new company would go to new investors. Icahn's
plan would include no more than $1.5 billion in long-term debt
incurred by the steel division.
   The stockholders will vote on Icahn's proposal at USX's annual
meeting May 7.
   USX has opposed the plan. Executives said it would make Marathon
and U.S. Steel more vulnerable to slumps in either the energy or
steel industries.
   USX has said 65 percent of its revenue comes from Marathon,
while 31 percent come from steel operations.
   Icahn, who is the chairman of Trans World Airlines, said in the
letter USX could properly structure the division of its companies
to make them essentially tax-free to the company and its
stockholders. The plan would preserve net operating losses of USX,
he said.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry recently told Wall Street analysts
Icahn's plan had pitfalls because the company could lose tax
credits resulting from steel losses in the early 1980s.

<HEAD>Airline Wants Frequent Fliers to Cash in Miles for Other Goodies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AAdvantage is CQ throughout</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc., looking for ways
to increase traffic and also eliminate free travel owed millions of
travelers, will let frequent fliers turn miles into money rebates
on purchases from fast cars to fur coats.
   The rebates, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars
depending on the product and miles exchanged, will be paid directly
to customers from the product makers, Michael W. Gunn, American's
marketing vice president, said Tuesday.
   The program also will help manufacturers, such as automakers,
boost sales.
   ``Our customer research shows that while most members will still
claim travel awards, a significant number appreciate the option of
savings on products and services,'' Gunn said at a news conference
announcing a program called AAdvantage Extra.
   Most other major airlines said they were studying American's
program, but Delta Air Lines spokesman Neil Monroe said the
Atlanta-based carrier was pleased with its current frequent flier
program and planned no changes.
   Gunn suggested the program would be hard to match because it
took American 11 months to assemble.
   But Phillip J. Lederer, a management professor at the University
of Rochester who follows the commercial airline industry, said, ``I
would be surprised if the majors didn't follow.''
   Some analysts have worried that the buildup of free miles could
haunt the industry by slashing revenue as customers cashed them in.
The Internal Revenue Service and accounting standards groups have
been considering whether individuals or companies should be taxed
or held liable for the miles.
   Randy Patterson, who publishes a magazine for frequent fliers,
praised American's program as a way to reward customers at the same
time the company gets rid of the potential free travel.
   ``I don't think they like the idea of having that liability on
their books,'' said Patterson, who estimated the company owes
customers some 70 billion frequent flier miles. Last year, American
flew 73.5 billion revenue passenger miles, which measures the total
travel of paying customers.
   Gunn would not confirm Patterson's estimate and refused to
provide company figures. Neither would he reveal American's
estimates of how many unused free miles the AAdvantage Extra
program would eliminate.
   Gunn said American had more than 11 million members in its
AAdvantage program, but less than half are active and only 2
million will receive one of the slick catalogs listing the rebate
items.
   Under the AAdvantage Extra program, customers with more than
20,000 miles can trade some miles for cash rebates of up to $1,500
on three 1990 Toyota models, $1,000 on a GRiD Systems computer or
$1,600 on a fox fur coat.
   The largest awards were a $15,000 rebate on an Adolfo lynx coat
from the Fur Vault in exchange for 120,000 miles, and, with 90,000
miles, a 10 percent discount on Deck House homes costing more than
$100,000.
   College Savings Bank will also allow AAdvantage Extra users to
buy certificates of deposit at a lower rate and higher yield than
the general public. Quick &amp; Reilly, a discount stock broker, will
charge reduced commissions in exchange for AAdvantage miles.
   AAdvantage members earn miles through flying on American
Airlines and some other carriers, staying in certain hotels and
using some rental cars. Miles also can be accumulated through using
some charge cards.
   Generally, the miles are then exchanged for free, or reduced
cost travel on American or other travel benefits.

<TEXT>
   The House has approved anti-takeover
legislation considered the toughest in the nation, meant to make it
more difficult for corporate raiders to grab or threaten
Pennsylvania companies.
   The 182-10 vote Tuesday sends the bill back to the Senate, where
members must consider amendments added by the House. Several
senators and aides predicted the bill, backed by Gov. Robert P.
Casey, would gain easy passage on its second trip through the upper
chamber.
   If enacted, corporate takeover strategists would be denied
short-term profits from takeover attempts. The provision would
apply when a takeover artist tries to sell holdings within 18
months of a failed buyout bid.
   The bill also would deny raiders immediate voting rights and
would require management to consider employee and community
interests along with stockholder concerns in deciding takeover
offers.
   Democratic representative Fred Taylor, a supporter of the
measure, said it would protect Pennsylvania jobs, companies and
communities.
   ``We're sending a message with this bill to corporate raiders
who have gone into Pennsylvania, laid waste to companies and forced
them to buy back their own stock, practically bankrupting them,''
Taylor said.
   ``We're telling them Pennsylvania is not the playground of Wall
Street. This doesn't outlaw takeovers all together, but it is
certainly going to make that proposition a lot more difficult to
participate in,'' he said.
   Opponents have said the measure would stifle investment in
Pennsylvania. The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission criticized the Pennsylvania bill Monday, saying it would
disenfranchise shareholders and leave incompetent managers ``free
to run a company into the ground.''
   Republican representative Robert Godshall, who oppposed the
bill, said it would take away ``fundamental and basic rights of
shareholders. I don't think this is good for Pennsylvania labor, I
don't think it's good for Pennsylvania industry and I don't think
it's good for the state of Pennsylvania.''
   The House made some minor changes to the bill but the its
sponsor, Republican Senator Noah Wenger, said it appeared largely
intact. Wenger said he expected the Senate to reconsider the bill
in about two weeks. The Senate initially passed the bill in
December, 45-4.
   ``In the long run, it will strengthen not only employment
oportunities but investment opportunites. ... Those people who make
the big bucks in takeovers would naturally be opposed to those
things,'' Wenger said.
   The measure stems from an effort to help a prominent
Pennsylvania company, Armstrong World Industries, fight off a
hostile takeover attempt by the Belzberg family of Canada. Belzberg
holds more than 10 percent of the company stock and is seeking to
put its candidate on the board of directors.
   William A. K. Titelman, a Harrisburg lobbyist who represents the
Belzbergs, said the legislation was a form of ``corporate
Stalinism.''
   ``The effect of this bill can be summed up in one sentence:
Regardless of competence or performance, the top management of a
publicly owned corporation shall not be changed except with their
express consent and regardless of the wishes of the owners of the
corporation,'' he said.
   More than half the states have enacted takeover laws, but only
Indiana has a section similar to Pennsylvania's proposal to
diminish directors' financial responsibility to stockholders.
   Under the legislation, company managers would be able to decide
to exempt their companies from the proposed law within 90 days of
its enactment. Workers laid off 90 days prior to the completion of
a takeover would be eligible for a lump sum severance of one week's
pay for each year of service, up to 26 weeks.

<TEXT>
   Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines,
frustrated by the company's mounting losses and plans to reduce
debt payments, have agreed to seek the appointment of a special
trustee to find a buyer for the carrier.
   The unsecured creditors' committee voted unanimously Tuesday to
reject Eastern's latest reorganization proposal, which would give
them only 25 cents for each dollar owed. A majority of the
creditors also voted to seek the appointment of a special trustee,
sources close to the committee said.
   ``This group has had it and they're not going to take it
anymore,'' one of the sources said.
   The move puts the creditors in alliance with Eastern's unions,
which have sought a trustee since Miami-based Eastern filed for
bankruptcy protection on March 9, 1989. The Chapter 11 filing came
five days after the start of a crippling strike by pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists.
   Until recently, the creditors had been supportive of Eastern
efforts to rebuild. The unions, meanwhile, have argued that a
trustee should take over the management of Eastern from Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. They accuse
Lorenzo of draining Eastern's assets into its sister carrier
Continental Airlines and Texas Air.
   In a meeting in New York Tuesday with officials of Eastern and
Texas Air, the committee of unsecured creditors rejected Eastern's
plan to repay 25 percent of the $980 million it owes them, the
sources said.
   The creditors' committee authorized its attorneys to ask the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court to appoint a special trustee to sell the
airline, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
committee dropped an earlier threat to press for a liquidation of
Eastern.
   The unsecured creditors include aircraft manufacturers such as
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie and jet engine makers like General
Electric Co.
   ``The plan presented today serves the creditors far better than
any alternative transaction, including liquidation or sale of the
airline, both of which are exceedingly remote,'' said Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   Referring to the creditors' move for a trustee, he said,
``assuming that is not a negotiating ploy, there is no legal or
policy basis for the appointment of a trustee.''
   Separately Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
adjourned until May 9 consideration of the unions' request for a
trustee, which previously had been deferred about half a dozen
times.
   The creditors' committee could present its trustee demand at
that time. The creditors also may be hardening their stance in an
effort to extract fuller payment from Eastern.
   Last July, Eastern promised creditors full repayment of debts
with interest. It slashed that proposal in late January to 10 cents
on the dollar in cash when the airline emerges from bankruptcy
protection, and another 70 percent over the following 10 years,
without interest.
   After the creditors balked, Eastern reached agreement with them
in mid-February on a plan that would pay 50 cents on the dollar
upon emerging from bankruptcy. But Eastern told the creditors last
week it couldn't fulfill that agreement because of problems in
attracting passengers and rebuilding its operations.
   In response, the creditors' committee privately passed a
resolution last week authorizing its attorneys to seek the
appointment of a trustee to replace current management and to
propose a plan of liquidation.
   The creditors' attorneys would take such action if Texas Air
refused to cover Eastern's future operating losses, according to
the resolution.
   At Tuesday's meeting, Robert Ferguson, a vice president of Texas
Air, told the creditors the company would agree to cover only a
portion of Eastern's losses, the sources said.
   The carrier's latest plan called for paying 10 cents on the
dollar in the form of Eastern notes guaranteed by Continental,
another 10 cents in Texas Air notes, and the remaining 5 cents in
cash, the sources said.
   This time, the creditors responded by calling for a sale of
Eastern rather than a liquidation. Earlier speculation about a
possible liquidation had hurt the airline by scaring away
passengers and travel agents.
   ``They took out the `l' word,'' a source said.
   The creditors have been soliciting possible buyers behind the
scenes in recent weeks, sources say.
   The creditors' committee also was concerned that calls for
liquidation could jeopardize the proposed sale of Eastern's prized
Latin American routes to rival American Airlines for $349 million.
Proceeds from that sale are central to Eastern's plan to rebuild.
   The transaction was approved by Lifland last Thursday, but still
must be approved by the Transportation Department. A decision by
the department is expected by Friday.
   A committee of the airline's preferred shareholders also has
expressed disapproval with Eastern's reorganization and repayment
proposals.

   The stock market was mixed today, bogging down
after Tuesday's broad advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 36.26 points
Tuesday, rose 3.61 to 2,740.32 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 559 up, 592 down and
552 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.61 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said U.S. stocks seemed to be getting some continued
benefit by comparison with the Tokyo market, which has undergone a
severe shakeout in recent months.
   Alongside Japanese stocks, American issues are seen as

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending gains posted in the previous session in the wheat and
corn markets.
   Some of the buying was seen as a follow-through to Tuesday's
rally. Analysts attributed further strength to forecasts for frost
early next week in U.S. winter wheat country and to the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Tuesday that 100,000 metric tons of
U.S. corn were sold for export to unknown destinations, which often
means the Soviet Union.
   Soybean futures drew early support from the soybean meal market,
which rallied on reports of more active meal trading in Europe at
higher prices.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.64} a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $2.67 a bushel; oats were {

   Complex trade negotiations with Japan entered
an unscheduled third day today as U.S. Trade Ambassador Carla Hills
warned that the Japanese must make concessions or face growing
prospects of economic retaliation by the United States.
   The negotiations, aimed at making broad structural reforms in
the economies of both the United States and Japan, began Monday
with the arrival of a 64-member delegation from Japan.
   While both sides are insisting that progress is being made, the
talks had originally been scheduled to conclude on Tuesday.
However, negotiators met for a third day of closed-door bargaining
at the State Department. Talks on both Monday and Tuesday went late
into the night.
   Hills denied that the lengthy negotiations indicated unexpected
roadblocks had developed.
   ``There is no deadlock. We are making progress,'' she told
reporters following a speech to the National Association of
Manufacturing. ``We want to get it done.''
   Hills told officials of the big industry lobbying group that the
market-opening moves being proposed by the American side were in
the self-interest of Japanese consumers, who currently pay the
highest prices in the industrial world for many products.
   As she has done in the past, she said that without trade
concessions on the part of the Japanese to correct the huge
U.S.-Japan trade imbalance, there would be growing pressure in this
country to retaliate by raising the cost of Japanese products.
   ``If the Japanese do not open up the second largest market in
the world, there will be enormous political pressure,'' she told
the manufacturing officials.
   President Bush was scheduled to meet today with former
ambassador to Washington Nobuo Matsunaga, who was dispatched to
Washington as the personal emissary of Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki, who has made resolution of U.S.-Japan trade frictions a
top priority of his government.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ``we seem to
have made good progress'' on trade disputes involving
supercomputers and satellites in the two-and-a-half days of talks
with Japan.
   ``We still have differences, we still have some difficult issues
to resolve. But at least we feel that a good start's been made,''
Fitzwater said.
   After months of no progress with Japan on trade, there have been
three agreements reached in the past 10 days _ on opening Japanese
markets for sale of American-made telecommunications products,
supercomputers and satellites. The satellite agreement was
announced late Tuesday.
   Even with the flurry of new agreements, American business
leaders urged caution, noting that the Japanese over the past
decade have prepared a variety of trade packages which have not
produced the promised results. America's deficit with Japan totaled
$49 billion last year, close to half of the total $109 billion
trade imbalance.
   ``I still think it is up in the air whether the trade talks will
yield any meaningful results,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of
the National Association of Manufacturers, which was to receive a
progress report today on trade negotiations from U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   The Bush administration last July launched discussions with
Japan aimed at removing broad structural barriers in both the
United States and Japan that were viewed as primary reasons for the
trade imbalance.
   Under the format for the talks, known as the Structural
Impediments Initiative, both sides have presented their own list of
the economic failings they would like to see corrected in the other
country.
   The United States has pushed for changes in Japan that would
expand opportunities for U.S. and other foreign firms to provide
products and services, arguing that such proposals were in the
self-interest of the Japanese because they would lower consumer
costs.
   Japan has targeted various U.S. failings that hurt America's
ability to compete internationally. The Japanese would like to see
more done by U.S. officials to lower the budget deficit, improve
the educational system and get U.S. businesses to focus on
long-term goals rather than quick profits.
   Negotiators hope to have an interim progress report completed by
mid-April with a final report on structural barriers finished in
July.

<TEXT>
   The Senate began debate today on President
Bush's choice as chief savings and loan regulator with Democrats
denouncing the nominee as unqualified for the job.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a 44-year-old former
senior Labor Department official, did not have the relevant
experience needed to regulate the nation's 2,500 S&amp;Ls at this
crisis point in the industry.
   ``This is an enormous job. ... You want someone of towering
capacity. ... At a minimum, you want somebody who has a
well-established reputation as an expert in finance,'' Riegle said.
``... You can't settle for something less than what you need for
the task at hand. Unfortunately, that is what you have here.''
   Nevertheless, most senators and industry lobbyists predicted
Ryan will be confirmed by a narrow margin to a five-year term as
director of the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Republicans portrayed Ryan as a strong manager and tough
enforcement official who helped clean up the Teamsters Union as
solicitor of the Labor Department.
   ``Management experts often recommend you bring in somebody from
the outside. If there was ever an industry that needs to be shaken
up, it is this one,'' said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior
Republican on the banking panel.
   Riegle said senators had not yet agreed when to vote on Ryan,
but he said he expected two or three hours of debate, which would
put the vote late today.
   Both sides say Ryan's admission of past drug use will play
little role in the Senate debate. As part of his background
clearance, Ryan told the FBI that he had tried marijuana and
cocaine in the early 1970s, while he was in law school.
   ``I just don't think we can hold people responsible for
something they did in their younger years forever,'' Garn said.
   ``I made my judgment based on the lack of qualification,'' said
Riegle.
   Two Democrats _ Richard Shelby of Alabama and Terry Sanford of
North Carolina _ registered support for Ryan last week when the
Senate Banking Committee endorsed the nomination on an 11-10 vote.
   If the administration can hold all 45 Republicans in the
100-member Senate, it needs to pick up only three more Democrats.
Vice President Dan Quayle then could break a 50-50 tie for the
Republicans.
   Such an outcome would not overly upset Democrats, said Kenneth
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of America.
   ``You have someone in office who you can point your finger to
and say, `I told you so','' he said.
   The administration is under pressure to appoint a thrift office
director because of a judge's ruling March 21 that officials of the
agency lack constitutional authority to seize failing S&amp;Ls. An
appeals court's suspension of the ruling expires April 11.
   If Ryan is defeated, Riegle has prepared legislation that would
remove the basis of the legal challenge and allow acting thrift
office director Salvatore Martoche to serve another 90 days.
   Democratic and Republican senators discussed the nomination at
private luncheons Tuesday.
   In the Democratic caucus, ``There was a lot of loud talk, but
the expectation was (Ryan) will get by on a tight vote,'' said one
source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I think he'll be confirmed, but I have no idea what the
numbers will be,'' Garn said after the Republican meeting.
   Many savings and loan executives are leery of Ryan because at
his confirmation hearing last week he said he was unsure if the S&amp;L
industry should survive.
   However, S&amp;L trade groups say they've been staying out of the
battle, not wanting to campaign against the man likely to be the
industry's chief regulator.
   Charles H. Keating Jr., who as owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association is at the center the nation's worst thrift failure and
defendant in a $1.1 billion fraud suit filed by regulators, wrote
letters to all senators opposing Ryan.
   ``I submit this is hardly the time to shrink from the challenge
of finding competent people to handle the important affairs of our
government. ... I fear for the future of the republic,'' Keating
wrote.

<HEAD>London Shares End Lower on Mediocre Wall Street Showing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the London Stock Exchange closed lower
Wednesday after a mediocre early showing on Wall Street.
   Market watchers said stock prices generally were flat for most
of the session, with little stimulus to trade.
   ``There are a few stories out there but there's nothing driving
the market,'' said one dealer, who spoke anonymously. ``We're
lacking motivation.''
   The combination of Monday's steep losses and Tuesday's smart
gains confused investors, traders said, adding that these
conditions were likely to persist until a clearer near-term trend
was spotted.
   At the close, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 9.1 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,231.6.
This was below its early morning peak of 2,247.5 and slightly
better than the late afternoon low of 2,229.2.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed 11.6 points
lower at 1,749.7. The Financial Times 500-share index finished at
1,205.77, down 5.42.
   By recent standards, volume registered a respectable 505.4
million shares, down from the 553.4 million shares that changed
hands Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   West Germany said Wednesday it wants a
basic pact on monetary union with East Germany settled by early
next month, although the East Germans are expected to be tough
negotiators once serious talks begin.
   East German politicians firmly have rejected a proposal, made by
West Germany's central bank, that their citizens receive one West
German mark for every two East marks. The East Germans are
demanding a 1-to-1 conversion.
   Under monetary union, West Germany's strong deutschemark will
replace East Germany's nearly worthless currency. Monetary union is
a cornerstone of plans to rescue East Germany's battered economy
and is a crucial element in West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
blueprints for unification.
   Kohl's government has given conflicting signals about the
central bank proposal. Some members of his coalition flatly have
rejected the bank's recommendations, while others have suggested
they are acceptable in principle.
   The issue will play an important role as East German politicians
attempt to put together the nation's first democratic government.
   Officials with the Kohl-backed Alliance for Germany, which won
the most parliamentary seats in March 18 elections, have scorned
the central bank recommenor Party leader Shimon Peres announced Wednesday
he has a majority to form a ruling coalition and that he has
requested a special Parliament session to approve the new
government.

   Stock prices turned downward today in a mood of
caution over the touchy state of the Tokyo market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 36.26 points on
Tuesday, dropped back 15.31 to 2,721.40 by 3 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 549 up, 912 down and
490 unchanged.
   U.S. stocks lately have appeared to have been benefiting by
comparison with the Tokyo market, which has undergone a severe
shakeout.
   Alongside Japanese stocks, American issues are seen as
conservatively valued in relation to earnings. So far the jolts in
Tokyo trading have had few ripple effects on Wall Street.
   However, brokers said investors grew uneasy this afternoon as
speculation spread that the Japanese market might be in for a
further battering on Thursday.
   They also noted worries over the outlook for domestic corporate
profits. When earnings reports for the first quarter are issued
over the next few weeks, they are expected to show the continued
effects of slower growth and wary attitudes among consumers and
business planners.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down | at 41&rsqb;; General Electric, down { at 64{;
International Business Machines, down &lsqb; at 106{, and Woolworth,
down 1~ at 61|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.25 to 187.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .96 at 360.69.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 138.55 million shares with an

   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks by
the Big Three automakers slipped 1.5 percent in late March compared
with last year, extending the downturn that began six months ago,
the companies said Wednesday.
   A severe drop in sales of Chrysler Corp. vehicles and a smaller
decline in Ford Motor Co. car sales more than offset a moderate
sales gain by General Motors Corp.
   The decline during the March 21-31 period this year came against
a relatively soft sales period last year.
   Altogether GM, Ford and Chrysler, which account for about 85
percent of the domestically made cars sold in the United States,
reported that their cars and light trucks were bought at a combined
average daily rate of 37,623 during the period this year compared
with a 38,193-vehicle-a-day rate last year.
   Car sales declined 4.3 percent and truck sales rose 3.1 percent.
   There were no definitive reasons for the overall decline, such
as the presence or absence of incentives, which often color
year-to-year comparisons. The figures indicate that consumers
either are hanging on to their cars and waiting for incentives
later in the year or simply that demand is weaker than during the
late-March period last year.
   Through the first three months of this year, the Big Three's car
and truck sales were down 3.6 percent compared with the first
quarter of last year.
   Normally, sales pick up in March and April as consumers think
more about road trips than they do in the winter months. But last
year, and so far this year, that trend hasn't held.
   For March this year, Big Three car and truck sales were running
6.3 percent behind the rate last year.
   GM said late-March car sales were 3.9 percent ahead of last year
and truck sales were up 10.9 percent, combining for a 6.1 percent
increase in vehicle sales. The company's car and truck sales since
January were down a slim 0.7 percent.
   Ford reported its cars and trucks were selling at a pace 3.8
percent behind last year during late March with car sales down 8.1
percent and truck sales up 2.9 percent.
   For the first three months of the year, Ford's vehicle sales
were 6.3 percent behind last year's pace.
   Chrysler's vehicle sales were down 16.6 percent in late March
with car sales falling 23.7 percent and truck sales dropping 9.4
percent. For the first quarter of this year, Chrysler's car and
truck sales were 5.6 percent behind last year's pace.

<HEAD>Notorious Wall Street Felon Ends Prison Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky, the disgraced Wall Street
speculator who made insider trading a household term in the 1980s,
completed a three-year prison sentence Wednesday when he was
released from a halfway house.
   Boesky, 53, signed release papers and left the Brooklyn House
Community Corrections Center at 5:05 a.m., said Richard Luna, a
U.S. Bureau of Prisons official in New York.
   Boesky was transferred to the facility Dec. 6 from a
minimum-security federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., to finish out
his term. He ended up serving just over two years, with time off
for good behavior.
   On Nov. 14, 1986, Boesky paid $100 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and agreed to plead guilty to one criminal
count of lying to federal regulators to settle charges of rampant
insider trading.
   The penalty was a record at the time, and Boesky's confessions
of a rat's nest of illegal stock dealings using confidential
information stunned Wall Street during its greatest boom time since
the 1920s.
   Prosecutors used information supplied by Boesky, who cooperated
in exchange for leniency, to bring charges leading to a record $650
million settlement by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and an indictment
against Drexel junk bond division chief Michael Milken.
   Court documents alleged that Drexel, which collapsed last month,
and Milken had a secret arrangement with Boesky that violated
securities laws in at least 16 transactions from 1984 to late 1986.
   Boesky began his term at the Lompoc Federal Prison Camp in April
1988. He was granted a month-long furlough in New York last
November _ when he was photographed by a New York tabloid with
shoulder-length hair and a Rip van Winkle beard _ before his
transfer to the halfway house.
   Starting Feb. 5, Boesky lived outside the center, reported in
twice a week and called in daily, Luna said. Boesky now must to
report to a probation officer regularly until September, said
Eunice Jones, chief federal probation officer in New York.
   Boesky's lawyer, Robert McCaw, declined to comment on where
Boesky has been living or what his plans are. Boesky owns a 75-acre
estate in Westchester County north of New York City, where he had
lived with his wife, Seema.
   While living outside the halfway house, Boesky was required to
have a paying job, although officials declined to say what that
was. Halfway house staff members visited Boesky once a week at his
home and job, Luna said.
   Under his settlement with the government, Boesky is barred for
life from the securities industry. But a loophole in federal law
reportedly could allow him to serve as an investment adviser for up
to 14 people.
   A source close to Boesky said he did not believe Boesky, who
wrote a 1985 book ``Merger Mania,'' was compiling his memoirs. The
source said Boesky would not grant any of numerous interview
requests until he has finished his role as a government witness, if
then.
   Boesky is expected to testify against Milken, whose trial may
not begin until 1991, and at the securities fraud trial of former
stock speculator John A. Mulheren, scheduled to begin April 30.
   Mulheren was a former business associate of Boesky's who at one
point was arrested for weapons possession and allegedly told police
he planned to kill Boesky.
   The silver-haired Boesky also still faces more than two dozen
shareholder lawsuits and other litigation naming him, his defunct
partnership CX Partners LP and affiliated entities such as Drexel
and Milken. The lawsuits are pending in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan before Judge Milton Pollack.
   Mitchell Kaplan, a Boston attorney for CX Partners, which was
Boesky's main stock-trading fund, said information gathering is
completed but the government has barred both sides from
interviewing a list of about 200 witnesses, presumably because of
Milken's pending trial.
   Under the first civil settlement of Boesky-related cases,
reached in January, the 46 investors in Boesky's partnership will
receive $248 million in liquidation proceedings.

<HEAD>Reject Challenge by Dissident Stockholders, Small Power Producers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge rejected
challenges Wednesday to shareholder and creditor approval of
Northeast Utilities' takeover plan for bankrupt Public Service
Company of New Hampshire.
   Judge James Yacos refused to consider a bid by a lawyer
representing a group of small power producers to have their votes
counted as rejecting the plan. He said the request came too late.
   Lawrence Katz argued that the small producers claims aren't
adequately recognized in the Northeast plan because its rate
agreement says Northeast will try to renegotiate contracts between
Public Service and 13 of the small power producers.
   But Yacos said any future contract negotiations between a
reorganized Public Service and the small producers would be a
two-way affair, and that the Northeast plan does not deny any
contracts outright.
   ``This reorganization plan recognizes your claims,'' said Yacos
in accepting the unsecured creditors' approval of the plan.
   The first half of Wednesday's hearing was devoted to officially
accepting ballot results. Yacos said he would consider objections
raised by small power producers and stockholders when actually
discussing confirmation.
   A group of ``dissident'' stockholders led by Robert Richards of
New York City told the judge that common stockholders aren't
getting enough money back in the deal and that voting by
rank-and-file stockholders was tainted.
   But Yacos said the $762 million figure was agreed upon after 15
days of disclosure hearings in November and he found no reason to
reverse his approval.
   Public Service filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1988,
the largest public utility to do so since the Great Depression.
Much of its financial problems stemmed from expenses associated
with the Seabrook nuclear plant, which became a nationwide focal
point of antinuclear opposition.
   The majority of stockholders approved the $2.3 billion
reorganization plan, calling for seven annual 5.5 percent
electricity rate increases.

<TEXT>
   There's a mouse in the kitchen, but
call off the exterminator. He's a familiar guy named Mickey, and
all he wants is to expand the vast Disney empire into restaurants.
   Walt Disney Co. already has capitalized in the retail industry
through stores at shopping malls selling clothing and other
products adorned with its characters.
   On April 28, the 50th Disney Store is to open at the Montclair
Plaza mall 35 miles east of Los Angeles. Connected to it will be
Mickey's Kitchen, a prototype that will be duplicated around the
country if successful.
   ``The Disney restaurant will be an exciting new concept
featuring fast food in a fun setting,'' says a mall sign seeking
counter help and kitchen workers.
   Disney hopes store customers won't be able to resist stopping
off for a quick bite to eat or a drink at the soda fountain next
door. Disney Stores range from 3,000 to 5,000 square feet; the new
connected store and restaurant will be about 12,000 square feet,
with seating for about 150 at the counter and tables.
   The restaurant is the latest experiment in cross-marketing for
Disney, said Harold Vogel, a securities analyst who follows Disney
for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``They're looking at all sorts of concepts,'' Vogel said
Wednesday. He said the Disney Stores ``have been very successful
because the Disney brand name _ until recently, anyway _ seemed
underexploited.''
   Chuck Champlin, a spokesman for Disney's consumer products
division, said the restaurant will use Disney's familiar characters
in new ways. He wouldn't say exactly how, but noted that Disney
Stores feature figures of the characters posed so they appear to be
filming movies.
   In a Torrance mall, for example, the display takes the form of
an outer space adventure, with cameraman Goofy filming Donald Duck
in pursuit of a villain who has kidnapped Minnie Mouse.
   Despite the sign posted at the restaurant site and a restaurant
logo that shows Mickey holding a burger and milkshake, Disney wants
to avoid the association with high-fat, high-calorie fare that the
words ``fast food'' often summon.
   ``We're very concerned, with the Disney image, that a restaurant
with the Disney name is safe for you, so we want it to be healthier
than in some fast-food places,'' Champlin said. However, he
declined to reveal the menu, saying it still was being finalized.
   Disney has extensive experience with restaurants in its theme
parks and hotels, Champlin said.
   No one at the mall thinks the idea is goofy, said Sonya Bennett,
19, the assistant manager of the Wild Pair shoe store directly
across from Mickey's Kitchen.
   ``I've heard people talking about it,'' she said. ``They say
they can hardly wait for it to open.''
   Parents with small children and teen-agers were the most
inquisitive, she said.
   It took about six months for the first Disney Store to prove its
viability after it opened in the Glendale Galleria in April 1987.
Disney is making no promises regarding the restaurants.
   ``The watchword is very slow development,'' Champlin said.
``We've got the one restaurant now, and we want to study carefully
before going ahead with any more.''

   Italy vowed Wednesday to dedicate its upcoming
presidency of the European Community to speeding up monetary,
economic and political union in order to keep up with the pace of
change in Eastern Europe.
   Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said integration of the 12
EC countries needs to be accelerated as a result of the political
upheavals throughout the Soviet bloc and the process of German
reunification.
   He said Italy will seek to play a pivotal role in the creation
of a new Europe when it assumes the EC's rotating sixth-month
presidency on July 1.
   ``The events of the first months of this year are already
compelling us to step up our pace in the wake of German
reunification which is moving ahead of European unification,'' said
a working paper on Italy's EC agenda.
   The document, presented at a news conference by De Michelis,
described 1990 as ``an era comparable only to the aftermath of
World War II.''
   Common Market leaders are scheduled to open a special conference
in Italy in December to rewrite parts of their founding 1957 Treaty
of Rome. The revisions will clear the way for economic and monetary
union, including creation of a regional central bank and a common
currency.
   De Michelis said the monetary conference will begin Dec. 14 and
should be concluded within the first six months of 1991, rather
than the end of the year as originally envisioned.
   He said Italy wants a conference on political union to be held
simultaneously with the monetary talks. These negotiations would
reform EC institutions, extend the powers of the European
Parliament and strengthen political cooperation with the aim of
shaping a common foreign policy.
   De Michelis said the political treaty could be implemented as
early as the next European Parliament elections in 1994. He gave no
details of the new political structure, which has been variously
described as the European Union or the European Federation.
   Although British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has opposed
monetary and political union, De Michelis said the ``prevailing
opinion'' among EC members favors the unity programs and that on
the whole the Community is moving ``toward harmony and away from
dissonance.''
   With the EC scheduled to become a single market by the end of
1992, Italy will seek to push through approval this year of most of
the remaining provisions necessary to meet the deadline, De
Michelis said. The 12 nations have already approved 60 percent of
the 279 directives, but the Italian working paper said ``a strong
political will and a further stepping up of our pace is necessary.''

   An afternoon round of selling pushed stock
prices lower Wednesday in a mood of caution over the touchy state
of the Tokyo market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 36.26 points on
Tuesday, dropped back 17.34 to 2,719.37.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 596 up, 918 down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.54 million
shares, against 154.31 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 192.34 million shares.
   U.S. stocks lately have appeared to benefit by comparison with
the Tokyo market, which has undergone a severe shakeout.
   Alongside Japanese stocks, American issues are seen as
conservatively valued in relation to earnings. So far the jolts in
Tokyo trading have had few ripple effects on Wall Street.
   However, brokers said investors grew uneasy Wednesday afternoon

   They also noted worries over the outlook for domestic corporate
profits. When earnings reports for the first quarter are issued
over the next few weeks, they are expected to show the continued
effects of slower growth and wary attitudes among consumers and
business planners.
   The day offered one consoling note for stock traders. The search
for ``safe haven'' investments helped send interest rates lower in
the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.50
percent-8.58 percent range.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down } at 41\; General Electric, down } at 64\; Philip
Morris, down &rsqb; at 40{; International Business Machines, down &lsqb; at
106{, and Woolworth, down 2 at 61{.
   Among specialized investment companies that focus on Asian
markets, Japan OTC Fund dropped 1&lsqb; to 11&lsqb;; Korea Fund 1| to 21{,
and Taiwan Fund \ to 25{.
   Meanwhile, trading at the American Stock Exchange was dominated
by heavy activity in warrants that give their owners a chance to
profit over a specified period of time from ups or downs in Japan's
Nikkei stock average.
   ``Put'' warrants, which are bought by traders expecting market
prices to go down, rose sharply. An issue of call warrants, which
represent a claim on a rising stock market, made its debut
Wednesday and led the Amex most-active list.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $20.19 billion, or 0.61
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.24 to 187.31.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.92 to 396.02, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.55 at 341.09.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
2.23 to 435.42. At the Amex, the market value index closed at
361.12, down .53.

   The dollar ended narrowly mixed Wednesday
against major foreign currencies as dealers marked time before the
release of government unemployment data and an upcoming meeting of
industrial nations.
   Gold prices rose following a mixed performance overseas. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery
settled at $377.10 a troy ounce, up $1.80 from late Tuesday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$377.75 an ounce, up $2.50.
   Currency dealers said technical factors dominated trading in the
absence of any strong buying or selling incentives.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York office of Banco
di Sicilia, said the market was awaiting the March unemployment
figures and the start of the Group of Seven meeting, both scheduled
for Friday.
   While the March jobless report was expected to shed some more
light on the direction of the U.S. economy, dealers said they
expected little to come out of the G-7 gathering.
   ``There should be more of the same reiteration of how they are
committed to free markets and exchange rate stability,'' Glamuzina
said.
   The G-7 includes the United States and its six biggest trading
partners: Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   Glamuzina said the dollar appeared poised for further increases,
at least in the near term, due largely to volatility in the
Japanese financial markets and the lengthy process of reunifying
East and West Germany.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar closed at
158.90 yen, down 0.05 yen from Tuesday. The dollar traded at 158.49
yen in London. In New York it finished at 158.875 yen, down from
159.765 yen on Tuesday.
   The dollar also was weaker against the British pound. Sterling
was quoted at $1.6416 in London, up from $1.6345 late Tuesday, and
at $1.64055 in New York, up from $1.6358.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.6999 West German marks in Europe,
down from 1.7005 marks late Tuesday, and 1.6995 marks in New York,
up from 1.6990.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5040 Swiss francs, up from 1.5035;
5.7095 French francs, up from 5.7085; 1,249.00 Italian lire, up
from 1247.75; and 1.16725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16565.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday included:
1.5060 Swiss francs, up from 1.5035; 5.7120 French francs, down
from 5.7410; 1.9115 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9150; 1,249.50
Italian lire, down from 1,254.00; and 1.1672 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1660.
   Gold traded in London at $374.50 a troy ounce, down from $375.05
late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold was bid at $374.50 an ounce, down
from $376.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $3.40 an ounce Wednesday to close at
$375.34.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.160 a troy ounce, up
15.3 cents. Silver traded in London at $5.02 an ounce, unchanged.

   Energy futures prices dropped sharply Wednesday
amid selling linked to a seasonal demand reduction and a report
that showed abundant supplies.
   Market analysts said a bearish attitude toward oil futures
intensified when crude fell below $20 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 52 cents to settle at
$19.78 a barrel, adding to Tuesday's loss of 18 cents. Contracts
for later delivery also posted declines.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale home heating oil for May delivery tumbled 1.48 cents to
54.02 cents a gallon, following a 0.23 cent gain on Tuesday. The
June, July and August contracts fell by 1.25 cents to 1.50 cents.
   May unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.20 cent Tuesday, fell
1.02 cents to 64.86 cents a gallon. Later contracts finished with
smaller losses.
   Natural gas for June delivery finished down 1.5 cents at $1.62
per million British thermal units.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
the American Petroleum Institute's weekly production and stocks
report showed a large buildup in crude oil inventory. The buildup
put the supply of crude significantly higher than it was a year
ago, he said.
   The proximity of warmer spring weather also is a negative for
the energy markets, Beutel said.

<HEAD>Late-March Sales Up Slightly; Down for Entire Month and Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks rose
2.9 percent in late March compared with last year, the automakers
reported Wednesday, but the increase stemmed largely from gains by
General Motors Corp.
   Auto industry analysts said the results were encouraging.
Nonetheless they said it was unclear whether the 6-month-long slump
was coming to an end.
   Vehicle sales by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. fell by 3.8
percent and 16.6 percent respectively during the March 21-31 period
this year compared with last year.
   GM's late-March car and truck sales rose 6.1 percent, mostly
because of its light trucks, including minivans that were offered
with buyer-luring incentives for the first time.
   On March 22, GM began offering $1,000 rebates and on its
three-vehicle line of minivans _ the Chevrolet Lumina APV, the
Pontiac Trans Sport and the Oldsmobile Silhouette. The program runs
until May 2.
   Combined car and truck sales for the nine major U.S. automakers
rose to a daily average of 43,688 during the period this year,
compared with an average of 42,451 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were up 2.7 percent and light-truck sales rose 3.2
percent during the period compared with a relatively soft period in
1989.
   However, for all of March and for the first three months of this
year, with imported vehicles included, sales lagged behind the
corresponding periods in 1989.
   Combined domestic and imported car and truck sales of 1,271,465
vehicles last month was 3.1 percent lower than the March sales
figures last year. For the first quarter of 1990, sales were 1.8
percent behind last year's pace.
   For the first three months of the year, Ford's car and truck
sales were down 6.3 percent and Chrysler's were off 5.6 percent.
GM's 3 percent decline in car sales was offset by a 4 percent jump
in truck sales during the quarter.
   ``During the (three-month) period, compact van sales increased
41 percent (over the same quarter last year) due in large part to
GM's newly introduced APVs,'' said J.I. Stark, executive director
for GM's worldwide vehicle operations.
   ``The real story here, as we end the first quarter, is that a
new trend has developed and GM is a market-share gainer,'' said
auto analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   Chrysler, with its Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler
Town &amp; Country, has held a commanding lead in minivan sales since
the vehicles were introduced in the mid-1980s.
   ``Chrysler minivans sales are up ... 15 percent for the calendar
year, although there has been some dropoff following a record
January,'' Chrysler said in a statement Wednesday.
   In January, Chrysler's minivan sales received a huge boost
through a $1,000 incentive. That program expired at the end of
January and minivan sales since then have dropped.
   Nonetheless, Chrysler's trucks, with minivans included,
continued in late March to outsell the company's cars. For the
first three months of the year, in fact, Chrysler sold 234,665
North American-made trucks compared with 194,879 cars.
   ``In 1990, we see once again that Chrysler is a super truck
company,'' Merlis said. ``I think the best is yet to come in the
car area. In some respects, this is a transition year.''
   Chrysler plans to introduce cars built from a new basic design
in late 1992.
   Merlis said the slump in the auto industry that began in
October, as the 1990 model year got under way, appears to have
bottomed out.
   ``Sales have found a resting point,'' he said. ``They've
stabilized at this plateau. It's not a robust rate but it could be
worse. The strong income growth in job creation and a stable prime
(interest) rate has created a nice underpinning for sales.''

<HEAD>Pepsi Using New Labels in a Summer Soda Promotion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. is giving the phrase pop art a
new slant, with four jazzy new labels for cans of its flagship soft
drink brand as part of a promotion to kick off the summer.
   The nation's second-largest soft drink company is calling its
special package designs ``Cool Cans.'' The new packages are showing
up in stores in the Northwest and will be available nationally by
early May, the Somers, N.Y.-based company said.
   One of the new designs features a drawing of a surfer in in an
array of red, yellow and blue colors along with the regular Pepsi
label.
   In another, a drawing of a woman's face appears on the label
with the Pepsi logo reflected in her sunglasses.
   A third design called ``Neon'' uses a black rather than a white
background, while a fourth called ``Party'' incorporates red, white
and blue streamers, dots, stars and diamonds into the label.
   Pepsi officials said 1.2 billion ``Cool Cans'' will be
distributed during the promotion. They will account for more than
half of the Pepsi cans on store shelves for the six- to eight-week
period which ends in June.
   Some package design analysts warn that it is a mistake to tamper
with a long-established label because loyal customers might
mistakenly feel that signals a change in the product itself.
   But Michael Simpson, executive vice president for marketing and
national sales at Pepsi-Cola, said Pepsi tried to avoid that
problem by incorporating some element of the original trademark
into the new designs.
   He said in consumer tests of the new labels ``people clearly
understood it was Pepsi. There is no missing the Pepsi logo. Even
the colors are consistent.''
   He said the new designs appeal to consumers of all ages.
   ``It's a very exciting, contemporary look,'' Simpson said.
``It's fun, interesting and consistent with the Pepsi heritage and
image.''
   The introduction of the design labels will be staggered every
two weeks starting in mid-May, the company said.
   In addition to the new labels, the company is creating a
promotion in which customers who find special markings at the
bottom of the inside of their Pepsi cans will qualify for $4
million in prizes ranging from $25 to $20,000.
   The promotion will be backed by a commercial expected to be on
network television by the end of April or early May featuring the
Grammy Award-winning rap artist Young MC.
   Last month, the nation's biggest soft drink company, Coca-Cola
Co., announced its own ``Magic Summer'' promotion.
   Coca-Cola is distributing 750,000 cans of what appear to be
regular cans of its flagship Coca-Cola Classic, but actually
contain prizes.
   Each specially designed can contains a mechanism that will
spring up when the top is pulled and deliver up to $200 in cash or
a certificate for other prizes.
   The cans are designed so that the spring mechanism and the prize
stay dry because they are separated by a barrier from liquid in the
can bottom.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Drop On Peru Strike Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Wedneday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid selling prompted partly by settlement of a
24-day strike against the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
   On other commodity markets, silver led precious metal futures
higher; coffee futures surged; petroleum futures sank; grains and
soybean advanced; andlivestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 2.95 cents to 4.7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April at $1.235 a pound.
   The end of the Peruvian strike was ``kind of a surprise,'' said
metals analyst Stephen W. Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Some
observers had not expected the company to negotiate with the
striking miners until after Sunday's presidential election.
   Platt said further selling was linked to the possibility of an
economic slowdown in Japan, a fear fueled by the recent decline in
the Japanese stock market.
   Because copper is used heavily in construction and
manufacturing, a Japanese slowdown ``could pull back on demand from
one sector that has been quite strong,'' Platt said.
   Silver futures rallied strongly on the Commodity Exchange,
leading gold higher, amid talk that Japanese financial institutions
were moving assets out of the stock market and into silver in a
``flight to quality.''
   Silver futures settled 15.2 cents to 16.8 cents higher with
April at $5.16 a troy ounce; gold was $1.80 to $1.90 higher with
April at $377.10 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures prices jumped on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on talk that Brazil is preparing to set a minimum coffee
export price of 80 cents a pound. Further buying was prompted by
strong roaster demand.
   Coffee settled 2.17 cents to 3 cents higher with May at 94.99
cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures sagged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid selling that largely reflected Tuesday's weekly American
Petroleum Institute inventories report.
   The report showed larger-than-expected U.S. supplies of crude
oil and heating oil but a smaller-than-expected gasoline supply.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 52 cents
lower with May at $19.78 a barrel; heating oil was 1.21 cents to
1.5 cents lower with May at 54.02 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .40 cent to 1.02 cents lower with May at 64.86 cents a gallon.
   Wheat and soybean futures rose strongly on the Chicago Board of
Trade, boosted by fears of a freeze this weekend in winter wheat
country and by stronger overseas demand for soybean meal. Corn and
oat futures also advanced.
   Wheat for May delivery rose sharply amid signs of tight
available supplies for delivery against the May contract.
   After the close, Agriculture Department announced that 121,000
metric tons of U.S. corn had been sold for export to unknown
destinations, which often means the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures settled 2} cents to 8\ cents higher with May at
$3.69} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with May at
$2.68\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with May at
$1.52\ a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 5\ cents higher with May
at $5.91 a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantil
Exchange amid perceptions that supplies of fed cattle are rising
and that the market has reached a seasonal top.
   Pork futures ended mixed, with technically inspired selling
offset by buying liked to higher cash hog prices.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .35 cent lower with
April at 78.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent to .42
cent lower with April at 82.27 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with April at 55.07 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .12 cent lower to .60 cent higher with May at 55
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Pays Record $6 Million in Rear Harness Restraint Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is paying $6 million to settle a
suit that stemmed from the automaker's failure to offer rear
shoulder harness restraints for the traffic-accident death of a
child and crippling injuries to his twin.
   The settlement announced Wednesday is the largest paid in a case
involving the lack of rear shoulder harnesses, said San Diego
attorney Craig McClellan. He negotiated the settlement on behalf of
the twins' parents, Jim and Patricia Miller, who also survived the
Nov. 13, 1988, accident.
   ``This landmark settlement clearly demonstrates that
manufacturers will be responsible for failing to install the
shoulder restraints in pre-1990 models,'' said McClellan. Dozens of
similar suits filed throughout the nation are pending against Ford
and other automakers.
   Under federal regulations, combination lap and shoulder safety
harnesses in the rear are mandatory for all passenger cars as of
this model year. In 1992, the requirement will be expanded to
include minivans.
   Ford admitted no liability in the settlement, negotiated over
the past two weeks before a Superior Court judge approved it.
   The Millers' car, a 1986 Ford Escort, was equipped with lap
belts only in the rear, which both boys were wearing on the day of
the accident.
   ``Reliable government studies show that lap belts in rear
seating positions, which have been installed on 140 million cars,
both Ford and non-Fords, are effective in reducing the risk of
death and serious injury in a collision,'' Ford spokesman Mark
Miller said from Detroit. He is not related to the victims' family.
   ``Certainly this is a tragic situation and Ford sympathizes with
the Miller family. At the same time, Ford was not responsible for
the accident. I think experts would agree it would be very
unfortunate if people stopped using rear lap belts because they can
enhance safety and reduce the risk of injury and fatality,'' Mark
Miller added.
   The suit stemmed from a head on-collision on a notorious ``S''
curve on Rancho Santa Fe Road in Carlsbad, about 40 miles north of
San Diego in which a another car crossed into the wrong lane and
crashed into the Millers' car. The other driver also died.
   On Tuesday night, the Carlsbad City Council approved a $550,000
payment to the Millers to settle their claims. The city also has
realigned the curve to make the roadway safer.
   The front end of the Escort was nearly demolished in the
accident, but James and Patricia Miller survived with broken bones
and bruises. They were strapped in their front seats with shoulder
harnesses.
   McClellan said the Escort's rear compartment was left virtually
intact but 11-year-old James Miller died in the crash and his twin
brother, Richard, suffered a fractured spine when he was pitched
forward violently. Both of the boys were wearing their lap belts.
   There is no question, McClellan said, that James Miller would
have survived and Richard Miller would not have become a paraplegic
if they had been wearing shoulder harnesses.
   Jim Miller said had he been given an option, he would have paid
to have rear shoulder harnesses in his Escort.
   ``Our experience clearly shows that anyone riding or driving in
a car without rear shoulder harnesses should be concerned about the
risk they are taking every time they go for a drive, even buckled
up,'' Jim Miller said.
   McClellan estimated the additional cost at $12 per belt. He also
noted that Ford has been installing rear shoulder restraints in
Escorts sold in Europe since the early 1980s.
   ``Ford never offered the U.S. market the rear-set shoulder
harness mandated by law in European Escorts because of the expense
_ $12 per belt,'' McClellan said. ``The Miller family tragedy is a
result of that conduct.''
   The attorney said Ford's own engineers told management years ago
that a shoulder restraint system was more effective than lap belts
in reducing the risk of injury or death in a collision and that any
argument against their installation was outweighed by increased
safety benefits.

<HEAD>Retailers Recovering But Expect Flat Sales, Executives Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated and Allied department stores on
Wednesday projected no sales growth for the quarter beginning in
May but said the retailers are recovering under bankruptcy court
protection.
   ``We clearly are doing better in Chapter 11 than we expected,''
James M. Zimmerman, president of Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp., told the first meeting of the retailers'
unsecured creditors.
   Zimmerman and other executives said Federated and Allied don't
know when they will complete a plan to repay creditors.
   The two companies sought U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection Jan.
15 because of huge debts stemming from their acquisition by the
Campeau Corp. in the 1980s. It was the largest bankruptcy filing in
retailing history.
   Zimmerman reiterated that except for attempts to sell the
Bloomingdale's chain, the companies have no plans to sell
subsidiaries to pay their debts.
   Federated and Allied on Monday reported combined losses of $45.7
million for February.
   On Friday, their corporate parent, Federated Stores Inc., asked
to have itself added to the Chapter 11 filing.
   The companies expect sales for the quarter ending in April to
decline 3 percent compared with the previous year, said Karen M.
Hugolet, vice president for planning. She said that in May, June
and July sales growth should be ``essentially flat, reflecting
recovery in bankruptcy.''
   Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, said at the creditors' meeting that 98
percent of merchandise suppliers have resumed shipments to stores.
He said that with a court-approved employee retention plan,
employee turnover is only slightly higher than last year's.
   ``In almost all areas of our operation, we have restored
normalcy,'' he said.
   Zimmerman said streamlining measures since Jan. 15 have saved
the companies $50 million. He said their expenses were $5 million
less than projected in February.
   Federated executives expect to decide within 30 days whether to
take Bloomingdale's off the market.
   Lawyers for retired Federated and Allied executives who lost
supplemental pension benefits when the companies sought Chapter 11
protection repeatedly asked the panel of executives when they would
consider restoring payments. The bankruptcy court stopped the extra
benefits that were part of the executives' contracts.
   ``These are not issues we take lightly, and I'm sure we would be
moved by individual accounts of the retirees,'' Zimmerman said.
``But our information tells us right now that such action would be
counterproductive.''
   Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer for the committee representing
Federated and Allied merchandise suppliers, said the retailers last
week produced a list of suppliers left holding checks when the
bankruptcy court froze Federated and Allied bank accounts.
   Rosenbloom said the suppliers have begun to research possible
ways of seeking repayment before Federated and Allied issue their
reorganization plan.

<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
joined New Jersey's congressional delegation Wednesday in seeking
to protect a New Jersey camera manufacturer from crippling foreign
competition.
   The lawmakers endorsed higher import quotas and tariffs, saying
500 manufacturing and distribution jobs at Keystone Camera Corp. in
Clifton, N.J., were at stake.
   The jobs are in the Clifton-Paterson, N.J., area, which the
congressmen called one of the ``most economically depressed zones
in America.''
   Keystone, which describes itself as the sole remaining American
manufacturer of conventional 35-millimeter and 110 cameras, filed a
petition for trade relief March 29 with the International Trade
Commission.
   Keystone requested tariff increases and quotas for five years on
low-cost imported cameras.
   ``The staggering increase in imports and product inventory which
Keystone revealed in its petition, together with the resultant
depressions of prices, production, profits and employment, poses a
compelling case for expedited relief,'' the 13 House members and
Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg wrote in a letter to U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a strong proponent of free trade, did
not sign the group letter. Instead, he will send a separate letter
urging Mrs. Hills to give the case ``fair consideration,''
spokesman Michael Jones said.
   ``He didn't sign the New Jersey letter because he believes the
Trade Commission should arrive at its decision first and then he'll
take a look at that to see whether he agrees with what its
conclusions were,'' Jones said.
   ``This action was taken by us in response to a veritable flood
of imports which began in 1987 and which drove prices to
unreasonably low levels, causing a succession of deep operating
losses,'' said Myron J. Berman, chief executive officer and board
chairman of Keystone.
   The International Trade Commission must make a determination in
the case by late July, a recommendation to the president by late
September and can provide relief within eight months, the company
said.
   Imports of 110 cameras under $20, 35mm fixed-focus cameras with
built-in flash and 35mm autofocus cameras retailing under $50 rose
from 11 million in 1985 to 27.5 million in 1987, Keystone said.
   ``We earnestly believe that what has happened to Keystone could
happen to virtually any efficiently run U.S. manufacturing
enterprise,'' Berman said.

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators, insisting that
they were making progress, struggled Wednesday to resolve final
differences on an unprecedented agreement attacking the huge trade
imbalance between the two nations.
   The discussions, which originally had been scheduled to end
Tuesday, were taking much longer than planned.
   U.S. officials said the two sides would meet again Thursday in
the hope of wrapping up the talks, which are aimed at altering
fundamental economic and business practices in both countries to
help reduce America's huge $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills denied that the extra
negotiating sessions indicated the talks had run into unexpected
roadblocks.
   ``There is no deadlock. We are making progress,'' she told
reporters.
   But in a speech Wednesday to a U.S. manufacturing group, Hills
sounded a warning on the possible consequences if Japan fails to
agree to American demands to open its markets to more foreign goods.
   ``There never has been a nation that benefited so greatly as the
Japanese from the freedom to sell and invest in foreign markets,''
she said. ``If the Japanese do not open their second largest market
in the world, there will be enormous political pressure to restrict
those opportunities that have given them so much. It will kill the
goose that laid their golden egg.''
   To emphasize the importance of the talks, President Bush met
Wednesday with Nobuo Matsunaga, a former ambassador to the United
States, and Deputy Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada, personal
emissaries from Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   After the meeting, Matsunaga told reporters he had stressed to
Bush that Kaifu was making a maximum effort to ease trade frictions.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was given a
personal letter from Kaifu which detailed the efforts the Japanese
government has made in the past month since Bush and Kaifu held a
two-day summit conference to review trade problems.
   In recent days, the Japanese have offered market-opening moves
in the area of American-made telecommunications products,
satellites and supercomputers.
   Fitzwater said that Bush told the envoys that Kaifu ``deserves a
very large share of the credit for settling the specific trade
issues.''
   Both sides have a lot riding on the outcome of the current
negotiations. The Japanese are anxious to stem a rising tide of
anti-Japanese sentiment in their largest overseas market while the
Bush administration is seeking ways to reduce America's $49 billion
trade deficit with Japan, nearly half of last year's total deficit.
   The latest round of negotiations began Monday and had been
scheduled to go only two days. However, it was extended because
both sides found it impossible to cover all the issues, even though
the talks were lasting into the early morning hours.
   The talks are unprecedented in their scope because they aim not
at boosting sales of specific products but at correcting broad
barriers to trade in both countries.
   The effort has prompted Japanese critics to charge that the
United States was trying to remake their nation and scrap centuries
of tradition in the process.
   However, the Bush administration, which began the discussions
last July, has maintained that its proposals would not only reduce
the U.S. trade deficit by expanding opportunities for American
sales in Japan but also lower prices paid by Japanese consumers,
currently the highest in the industrial world.
   Negotiators this week were preparing an interim progress report
outlining reforms each side is willing to make with a final report
scheduled for early July.
   Among the changes expected to be offered on the Japanese side
were proposals to increase enforcement of antitrust laws to
discourage bid-rigging and other practices by Japanese companies
that U.S. firms have claimed have kept them from cracking the
Japanese market.
   The Japanese were also expected to offer to boost spending for
public works projects and to relax restrictions on the
establishment of large retail stores.
   U.S. companies believe that allowing large stores in major
Japanese cities would expand opportunities for American retailers
and for foreign-made products, which are not readily available in
the smaller stores that predominate in Japan.
   On the U.S. side, the Japanese recently presented a list of 80
proposals designed to boost America's ability to compete
internationally. The administration is not likely to agree to the
most politically explosive ideas such as restricting Americans' use
of credit cards, boosting the gasoline tax and eliminating tax
deductions for home mortgage payments.
   However, the Bush administration was expected to point to
efforts the president is making to provide expanded tax credits for
personal savings, improve the U.S. education system and balance the
federal budget.

   The government agency charged with selling off

   The Resolution Trust Corp. action was announced Wednesday in
response to policy directives in the S&amp;L bailout legislation
enacted by Congress last summer.
   The RTC action also calls for establishment of a special
committee which will conduct formal reviews when RTC employes
believe they have received inappropriate requests from public

   It also outlined procedures for meetings between RTC employes,
public officials and their constituents including a requirement
that such meetings be attended by two or more RTC employees, one of
whom must be a senior-level employee.

   Paul Newman was alternately portrayed
as an egotistical movie star who reneged on a promise and a modest
philanthropist before the ``salad dressing'' suit brought by a
delicatessen owner went to a jury Wednesday.
   ``There are people in the world who operate on a different
level,'' Richard Albrecht, attorney for deli owner Julius Gold,
told jurors in his closing arguments. ``Some do so with grace, and
some do so with raw exhibition of power.
   ``It's the race car thing,'' Albrecht added, referring to
Newman's love of race-car driving as the actor sat smirking in the
back of the courtroom.
   Gold is seeking an 8 percent stake in Newman's Own Inc. and
Salad King Inc., claiming he spent four years advising Newman and
helping him establish the food businesses.
   Newman's lawyer portrayed the actor as an honest businessman who
started the two companies as a way to raise money for charity. He
played down the portrayal of Newman as a rich celebrity by
referring to Gold's success as a businessman.
   ``Gold is not some poor little shopkeeper,'' attorney W. Patrick
Ryan said. ``It's not David and Goliath _ get that out of your
head.''
   The six-member jury began deliberations at mid-afternoon and
were dismissed for the day about an hour and 45 minutes later.
   Gold said he was confident he would prevail.
   ``I would think the longer the jury stays out in this case the
better it would look for me,'' Gold said.
   Gold is suing Newman, writer A.E. Hotchner and the two food
businesses, claiming they reneged on a promise to give him stock in
return for his participation in the development and marketing of
Newman's Own salad dressing.
   An earlier trial ended in a mistrial in 1988 when the jury
mistakenly received depositions that had not been admitted as
evidence.
   Superior Court Judge George N. Thim told jurors they must
conclude that Gold had an oral contract with Newman and the other
defendants if they are to find in favor of Gold.
   Newman, who has been in court almost every day since the trial
began March 20, contends that Gold's only participation was to sell
some of the dressing in his Westport store.
   Newman and Hotchner started Newman's Own on a whim, beginning
with salad dressing that Newman originally made in the basement of
his Westport home and later expanding into spaghetti sauce, popcorn
and lemonade.
   All profits _ $28 million to date _ go to charity. The companies
had a record $42 million in sales last year, up from $36 million in
1988.

<HEAD>Judge Hears Dispute Over Occidental's Funding of Museum for Hammer
Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. is justified
in funding a museum to house the art collection of Chairman Armand
Hammer because it enhances Occidental's image, a lawyer for a
shareholder group said Wednesday.
   ``The oil and chemical business is risky,'' attorney William
Prickett said at a hearing before Maurice Hartnett, vice chancellor
of the Delaware Chancery Court.
   Prickett cited the Love Canal toxic waste incident and an
explosion that killed 167 workers on a North Sea oil platform as
examples of tragedies that have hurt Occidental's reputation. Given
those risks, building a museum to house a prominent collection is a
legitimate public relations expense for the company, he maintained.
   ``This is a unique chance for Occidental to be favorably
identified'' in the public eye, he said.
   Prickett was defending a settlement the shareholder group has
reached with Occidental that allows the company to continue to fund
the museum within certain limits.
   The court proceeding was called to hear a challenge to the
settlement by other shareholders, who have filed two separate
class-action lawsuits seeking to stop the company from spending
money on the museum. Attorneys for these shareholders contended the
museum's main purpose is to enhance the reputation of Occidental's
91-year-old chief.
   The museum is ``a gift to Armand Hammer'' that ``raised more
controversy and ill will than good will,'' said California's Deputy
Attorney General Susan Henrichsen, representing the California
Public Employees' Retirement System.
   Calpers, the nation's largest pension fund, owns 0.6 percent of
Occidental's stock.
   Occidental has said it will cost about $95 million to build the
museum and establish an endowment to sustain it. Construction
already has begun on a site next to the company's headquarters in
the Westwood district of Los Angeles.
   Hartnett listened to both sides, but did not rule and gave no
indication when he would do so. Occidental is based in Los Angeles
but incorporated in Delaware.
   Prickett's shareholder group originally filed a lawsuit
challenging the museum. The group dropped its suit after reaching a
settlement with the oil company that would limit its spending on
the project and require Occidental's name to appear on the museum
as well as Hammer's. The settlement also included a fee of $1.4
million for Prickett.
   Hartnett earlier called the proposed $1.4 million payment
``huge,'' and Prickett said he would not dispute the matter if the
judge lowered the award.
   The Occidental chairman announced plans to build the Armand
Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center after reneging on a
promise to give his $400 million collection to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. He and the county museum had been embroiled
in a dispute about how the art would be displayed.
   Prickett contended that a special committee of Occidental's
independent directors was justified in approving corporate funding
for the museum. He noted that Delaware courts have been hesitant to
intervene in cases involving business judgments made after
reasonable consideration, such as the Time-Warner merger.
   Grover Brown, a lawyer for the special committee, defended the
panel's support for the project and said committee members had a
combined 80 years experience in deciding what was best for
Occidental.
   ``The egocentrism of Dr. Hammer is not a matter for the court,''
Brown said.

<HEAD>Announces Agreement in Principle on Financial Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp., the nation's second-largest
convenience store chain, said late Wednesday it has reached an
agreement in principle with its main lenders to restructure part of
its $1.3 billion debt.
   Circle K accumulated much of its debt during a rapid expansion
that saw the company grow from about 1,000 stores in 1984 to 4,685
last year.
   The company said previously it might have to seek bankruptcy
protection from creditors if it could not work out a debt
restructuring. Last week, the company reported it lost more than
$40 million on operations during the quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Circle K said the agreement involved its bank lenders, a
committee of holders of $200 million Circle K senior secured notes
and American Financial Corp., Circle K's largest shareholder and a
creditor.
   The agreement envisions that the parties will enter into a
standstill agreement that would be effective the earlier of either
Oct. 31 or the successful completion of the company's financial
restructuring, the company said.
   Until then, the banks, bondholders and American Financial
``would defer all principal and interest payments on their
respective obligations and waive any existing defaults under their
current loan agreements,'' Circle K said.
   The standstill agreement would require Circle K by Oct. 31 to
buy back at least 90 percent of its $510 million in subordinated
debt, Circle K said. Terms of a buyback haven't been determined
yet, it said.
   The company said the standstill agreement is subject to approval
by remaining noteholders.
   Ray Cox, a Circle K spokesman, declined to comment further.

<HEAD>Billionaire Won't Renew Bid for United Airlines Despite Invitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis has no intention of
making a new bid for UAL Corp. despite the company's invitation to
do so, sources close to the negotiations said Wednesday.
   The Beverly Hills billionaire bid $275 a share for the parent of
United Airlines last August, about $6.2 billion. He was topped by a
$300-a-share offer for the Chicago-based company by team that
included UAL management, pilots and British Airways.
   That deal fell through last October for lack of financing,
however, causing UAL's share price to plummet.
   United's pilots, mechanics and flight attendants unions recently
have made a new bid estimated to be worth about $185 a share in
cash, debt and stock.
   Union spokesmen said they never believed Davis would make a new
offer even though UAL last month called off a standstill agreement
with Davis, freeing him to bid again for the company.
   The UAL move was seen as an attempt to avert a proxy war by the
company's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners. Coniston, which
owns 11.8 percent of UAL's shares, supported the unions' bid and
said it would wage a proxy battle to take over the board of
directors if the offer was not accepted.
   Crain's Chicago Business reported this week that Davis had
suggested a ``concept'' to the UAL board for a bid of about $220 a
share, the range the board has indicated would be acceptable.
   But two sources with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that Davis would not renew
his bid for UAL.
   One source said the unions had made clear they would strike if
Davis or another investor challenged their bid.
   ``No bank will lend into the face of a strike,'' he said.
``You've got the union trying to blackmail the board and they have
the ability to keep anybody else from playing.''
   He added that the unions will have problems arranging financing
themselves, even at the lower bid level, since no one outside has
offered to help them.
   ``There's no equity partner there, so the banks aren't willing
to finance the deal,'' he said.
