<HEAD>Eight Convicts on Loose after Mexican Prison Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday seized three
convicts who broke jail in a bloody shootout but eight remained
free, including a man convicted of 12 murders in Mexico and the
United States, a prison chief said.
   Gabriel Nahas, director of Chihuahua state's 14 prisons, said
authorities now have captured 26 of the 34 convicts who fled from
the state's largest penitentiary Tuesday in a break that killed
four people and wounded eight.
   Nahas said the prison at Chihuahua city was quiet Wednesday, but
that two of the most notorious inmates were still fugitives.
   One is Alfonso Parga Palafox, convicted as a drug trafficker who
murdered seven people in Mexico and five in the United States; the
other is Gerardo Noe Payan, convicted of killing three Chihuahua
university students in 1987, Nahas said in an interview.
   He said two inmates and two guards were shot to death in the
violence that broke out Tuesday afternoon, and four prisoners and
four guards were injured.
   The director said the break was led by convicted drug trafficker
Juan de Dios Levario Quiroz, who was shot to death trying to get
away.
   Nahas said the prisoners surprised six guards, overpowered them
and took away their weapons.
   ``Apparently it was all planned. Several prisoners had guns and
two vehicles awaited them outside,'' Leo Zavala, news editor of
Diario de Chihuahua newspaper, said Tuesday.
   He said authorities conducted a weapons search in the cell
blocks Wednesday and found two guns, both taken from guards and
hidden after the rioting.
   Visiting hours were suspended at the penitentiary, which houses
1,500 inmates in the capital city of Chihuahua, 225 miles south of
El Paso, Texas, Zavala reported.
   All the escapers are believed to still be in Chihuahua state and
a search is under way with helicopters, planes, cars and roadblocks
on major highways, Nahas said.
   Mexico does not have the death penalty. The maximum prison
sentence is 40 years.

<HEAD>Is Everything Kosher With Moshe Dragon's Duck?</HEAD>

   Life at Lenny Ung's Moshe Dragon went from
sweet to sour after the discovery of 18 suspicious ducks in the
kosher Chinese restaurant.
   Did the ducks conform with the ancient Jewish dietary laws, or
were they ``treyfe'' _ Hebrew for non-kosher abomination.
   The ensuing dispute, publicized in a series of investigative
articles in the Washington Jewish Week, sent the Washington area's
Orthodox Jewish community into a frenzy and pushed Ung toward
financial ruin.
   Ung, 29, an ethnic Chinese, escaped from Vietnam and came to
this country 14 years ago. Three years ago, he was lured from
Philadelphia to Washington by an investor who wanted the 30,000
Orthodox Jews in the Washington area to have a full-service kosher
restaurant.
   Moshe Dragon opened three years ago in the Washington suburb of
Rockville, Md.
   The food was kosher, meaning it adhered to the ancient Jewish
principles that forbid mixing dairy and meat products and only
allow meat from cloven-hoofed animals who chew their cud. Pork is
out, as are shellfish and scavenger fish.
   Ung obtained the required certification from the Rabbinical
Council of Greater Washington, an eight-member monopoly that for
some 80 years has been granting the kosher stamp of approval to
area restaurants, stores and caterers.
   The rabbis hired Michael Mayer as Moshe Dragon's ``mashgiach'' _
Hebrew for supervisor. Things were going well. Mayer understood
Ung, having served in Vietnam during the war, and he introduced him
to the Jewish community.
   But last summer Mayer found 18 ducks which he deemed non-kosher,
along with receipts from a non-kosher supplier. Non-kosher meat
generally is less expensive than kosher meat.
   Mayer sealed the birds in the freezer as evidence, and went to
tell the rabbis.
   Tempers flared, Ung accused Mayer of trying to destroy the
restaurant, and Mayer was fired.
   ``They did the classic Roman thing _ they killed the
messenger,'' said Mark Palmer, Mayer's lawyer.
   Concerned that Moshe Dragon might be harboring non-kosher food,
the rabbis destroyed the ducks, just in case. Had they waited, a
simple lab analysis could have determined the ducks' origins by
their salt content: to make meat kosher, it must be soaked in salt
water.
   When the rabbis questioned Ung, he said the receipts belonged to
his cousin. But he later recanted, became distraught and was taken
to the hospital. The rabbis said the questioning reminded him of
interrogations in Vietnam.
   A private investigator was brought in, and the rabbis
subsequently cleared Ung of all blame. But the PI, Susan Giller,
was unhappy.
   ``The evidence I found was not consistent with the rabbis'
conclusion,'' she said. ``I don't want to be associated with those
conclusions.''
   Rabbi Joel Tessler, a member of the Rabbinical Council, said the
rabbis stand by their finding that the restaurant complies with the
kosher dietary laws. Ung, he said, is an ``honorable man.''
   Meanwhile, critics of the Rabbinical Council called for a law
granting the state enforcement power over the implementation of
kosher standards. And Mayer's lawyer asked the Maryland Attorney
General to investigate whether Moshe Dragon violated the state's
Consumer Protection Act.
   Business declined as customers began doubting the restaurant's
standards after reading about the dispute in Washington Jewish
Week. Matters weren't helped when Regardie's, a local business
magazine, published a piece of its own about Moshe Dragon, complete
with lab analyses of the Moo Shu pancakes.
   Regardie's reported that lab tests found traces of whey in the
pancakes, a no-no when the pancakes are filled with meat. The
rabbis responded with their own lab tests, saying those did not
find any of the offending whey in two pancakes, and only minute
traces in a third.
   Enter Mordechai Kohler, the Orthodox food supervisor who
replaced Mayer.
   One day Kohler was incensed when a Chinese cook used a spoon
reserved for meat to ladle spices onto a fish _ also a no-no.
Kohler ended up quitting.
   In an interview with Jewish Week, Kohler said he was uneasy
about the practices at Moshe Dragon, including the presence of a
Buddha statue in the kitchen. He said workers, some of them devout
Buddhists, dedicated food to the Buddha.
   Ung admits there was a Buddha figurine on top of a refrigerator,
but he denied any sacrifices were made.
   The only sacrifice, he says, was his own.
   ``I tried to follow what the Council said,'' Ung lamented in
broken English. ``I want to do the right thing for the community.
My father teach me to do the right thing, not to cheat, not to
steal.''
   But Ung said he lost more than $30,000 and couldn't take the
aggravation.
   He is selling Moshe Dragon and plans to become an acupuncturist.
   ``Maybe that is less pain,'' he said.

   When the last finial is ceremoniously hoisted
atop the last spire of the Washington Cathedral in late September,
master carver Vincent Palumbo won't be laying down his mallet and
chisel for a well-earned vacation.
   ``Just because you put a roof on, it doesn't mean the house is
finished,'' said Palumbo, a short, mustachioed craftsman from
southern Italy who has spent the past 29 years embellishing the
majestic Gothic cathedral with stone carvings both pious and
irreverent.
   Sharing the scaffolding with his father until the elder
Palumbo's death in 1966, Vincent has carved hundreds of rosettes,
bosses, trefoils, ballflowers, finials, paterae, crockets,
gargoyles and groteques for the sixth largest cathedral in the
world.
   Soaring above Mount Alban in northwest Washington, the
nondenominational cathedral will be consecrated with pealing bells
and solemn oratory on Sept. 30, in a ceremony symbolizing the end
of 83 years of construction.
   But Palumbo said there are enough statues and decorative
sculptures left unfinished from the master plan of the cathedral's
original architect, Philip Hubert Frohman, to keep a stone carver
busy for another 30 years or more.
   ``We've accomplished a great goal, but there is still a lot to
be done,'' he said. ``Architecturally the cathedral is finished,
but ornamentally it is not finished at all. I hope I will stay to
see that it will be.''
   These are days of pride, sadness and uncertainty for Palumbo,
54, who once headed a busy team of 14 cathedral stone carvers. Now
he works alone in the silence of his studio, a small plywood shed
near the cathedral's newly completed west portal. His last job was
to engrave the cathedral's consecration stone.
   ``Right now I'm doing a little bit here and a little bit there,
waiting for the new people to decide what's next,'' he said. ``I am
the master carver, the foreman, the laborer, all by myself.''
   Palumbo is awaiting the appointment of a new cathedral dean to
succeed the Rt. Rev. John T. Walker, who died last year. Meanwhile,
said Richard T. Feller, the cathedral's clerk of the works or
construction superintendent, Palumbo will remain on the job at the
cathedral, which is administered by the Episcopal Church as an
ecumenical place of worship.
   When he locks up in the late afternoon, Palumbo said, ``I look
up and think, wow, look what we did!
   ``At the same time, I feel sad. The cathedral has been nearly 30
years of my life, and the major work is done. People have come and
gone, and some maybe I'll never see again.
   ``When I'm working alone, I miss the others. A few times I find
myself stopping and staring at the wall, thinking about the past,
and all of a sudden I wake up with the chisel and mallet in my
hand, like a dummy. It's a strange feeling.''
   After lunch, he sometimes slips alone into the cathedral and
gazes up at the huge ceiling boss, or keystone, where he and his
father, Paul Palumbo, worked side-by-side carving a crown of lilies
around Jesus and Mary Magdalene. ``My dad died two or three months
after that,'' he said.
   Palumbo is the fifth generation of a family of stone carvers
from the Adriatic coastal town of Molfatta on the heel of the
Italian boot. His father came to America in the 1950s after serving
as palace carver for Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. Vincent
followed him to the cathedral in 1961.
   A brash, hot-tempered youth trained in the family tradition of
carving marble, Vincent sweated under his father's patient tutelage
to learn the art of working with the softer Indiana limestone of
the cathedral's walls and ceilings.
   For fun, Palumbo has carved about 30 impudent gargoyles and
goulish grotesques, the medieval depictions of evil spirits
banished to the outer walls. These sculptures of demons, ugly
beasts and fantastic creatures serve a utilitarian function,
deflecting rainwater from the cathedral's stone facade.
   Palumbo himself is caricatured in a grotesque on the cathedral's
north side, his mallet raised and whistling over his shoulder at
passing schoolgirls below while a shocked clergyman looks on.
Another Palumbo look-alike can be spotted high above a statue of
St. Paul on the west front. ``It's the little grotesque with the
big mouth,'' he said.
   Other gargoyles peering down from the ramparts include a crooked
politician hurrying somewhere with a stuffed briefcase, a laborer
with hard hat and walkie-talkie, a Democratic donkey, a Republican
elephant and a 1960s hippie with long hair, patched jeans and
protest sign.
   Palumbo's proudest achievement, he said, is his carving of the
dramatic statue of St. Paul designed by sculptor Frederick R. Hart
for the base of the southwest tower at the cathedral's main
entrance.
   ``It looks almost alive, like it wants to talk to you,'' Palumbo
said of St. Paul, whose hands grope in the dark after his blinding
on the road to Damascus. ``That statue, it's the maestranza, the
mastery of my tools.''

   With a regularity that overwhelms
unloading crews, trains are trundling grain to Afghanistan in the
first U.N. operations ever based in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet officials stunned an international meeting in 1988 by
offering 400 million rubles for a U.N. program within their borders
to supply food and relief goods to northern Afghanistan.
   U.N. and Soviet officials admit the program has been fraught
with difficulties, but call it a success and a good start toward
Soviet involvement in humanitarian aid elsewhere.
   ``You saw the summit agreement on Ethiopia?'' said Nikolai
Skripka, a Foreign Ministry expert in Moscow, expressing enthusiasm
over the new Soviet role in U.N. and international relief.
   Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed to help starving
Ethiopians with American food transported by the Soviet Union.
   The Afghan program is part of Operation Salam, the U.N.
Coordinating Office for Afghanistan, headed by the former high
commissioner for refugees, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan.
   Operation Salam operates mostly from Pakistan and Iran, with
base camps in Afghanistan and an overall budget of more than $1
billion. The Soviet component in considered crucial.
   ``We have no other way to get to people in the north because of
fighting or logistical problems,'' Sadruddin said. ``Access through
the Soviet Union has made all the difference.''
   The first U.N. field office on Soviet territory is a discreet
compound tucked under shade trees in this somnambulant Uzbekistan
border town, the hottest spot in the Soviet Union.
   ``People often overlook us because we have no refugees, but the
implications here are extremely important,'' said Olivier Allais, a
French television producer turned diplomat.
   Gesturing toward the map, Allais indicated a broad range of
cross-border operations along the frontier.
   U.N. workers channel food, monitor health conditions and train
development teams. They are helping Afghans combat a locust attack
that threatens the season's food crop.
   Allais also supervises each Salam Express, special trains that
speed relief to the border.
   Grain is loaded in bulk at Helsinki, Finland, and carried via
Leningrad across the breadth of the Soviet Union to Friendship
Bridge, a vast span put up to facilitate moving Red Army units into
Afghanistan.
   Trains go straight to a bagging plant across the border at
Hairaton, where U.N. officials say lackadaisical Afghan crews,
slowed by restricted summer hours, run far behind schedule.
   Some sacks are returned to Termez and trucked north to Dushanbe
for distribution across remote border points. Altogether, U.N.
officials expect to distribute 35,000 tons of Western grain.
   Moscow's U.N. role, separate from its direct aid to the Afghan
government, is a delicate balance.
   U.N. volunteers help Afghans clear the uncounted and uncharted
mines left behind when Soviet troops in 1988 after nearly 10 years
in Afghanistan. No Soviet U.N. workers cross the border.
   Food is routed into local Afghan markets, with no attempt to
influence whether it reaches government-controlled or rebel areas.
Some goes to ``vulnerable groups,'' mainly families of guerrillas.
   Most areas supplied from the north are under guerrilla control,
but food reaches both sides, U.N. officials said.
   The Soviets support the program even though they backed the
Kabul government in its war with the Moslem insurgents.
   Skripka, the Foreign Ministry official in Moscow, made sure a
reporter saw a villager's quote reported in the Operation Salam
newsletter. It said:
   ``When the Soviets came with guns and tried to impose themselves
on us, we fought; if they now want to come as friends, they are
welcome.''
   One of the biggest problems is a centrally controlled Soviet
system that sometimes drives U.N. workers to foot-stamping rage.
   Each step must be approved by a Cabinet minister who delegates
officials to recruit state enterprises.
   In one operation, a U.N. official found his trucking contract
did not cover unloading or storage. He found space in a warehouse
yard, but had to negotiate another contract for guards.
   One day, when rain clouds gathered, he realized he needed yet
another contract for tarpaulins to save the emergency food from
ruin.
   If the office's single approved rubber stamp is taken to
Dushanbe for the signing of a contract, business halts in Termez.
   Allais has waited six months to buy the office a small sedan
with Soviet rubles, refusing to honor the local custom of greasing
the wheels with a bribe.
   ``It can be frustrating,'' he said, and smiled at what he
acknowledged was a gross understatement. ``But this is something
the U.N. has never done before. We are learning how to make use of
this huge Soviet economy.''
   At the same time, he said, Soviet officials took pains to help
Operation Salam, showing enthusiasm for a sort of international
cooperation unthinkable before Gorbachev.
   They have approved field offices along the Afghan border and new
operations by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and UNESCO to
work with Afghans.
   ``This is a start, but we are anxious to do what we can,''
Skripka said, producing a fat white book of project papers he
brought back from an Operation Salam meeting in Geneva.
   Allais is hoping success in Termez will hasten followup programs
and reinforcements. He covers the border with a single U.N. deputy,
four U.N. volunteers, a Soviet office manager and a secretary. A
World Food Program officer supervises grain shipments.
   ``This is an important step for the Soviets,'' Allais said.
``Without operations from here, all of northern Afghanistan would
be neglected.''

   America has gone Goofy this summer. And
Mickey. And King Kong. And Shamu.
   The tourist behemoth that includes Orlando and its environs
draws 13 million visitors a year. And this summer should cement
Central Florida's reputation as the nation's favorite vacation
destination.
   Universal Studios Florida, a glitzy, high-tech version of the
California attraction, opened officially June 7, and is expected to
be a strong competitor to the year-old Disney-MGM studios.
   Either of the two movie parks would be the largest attraction
almost anywhere else. But here they stand in the shadow of Disney
World, with its EPCOT Center, and stand shoulder to shoulder with
Sea World, Cypress Gardens and other older tourist attractions.
   Of course, not everyone can go to Disney World _ if they did,
the lines would rival the queues that form for just about any
staple in Moscow.
   So come vacation time this summer, some will go to their nearest
beaches, some will flee to the mountains, some will stay at home
and avoid doing the home projects they had planned.
   But some will join the crowds who flock to the popular vacation
spots.
   What follows is a tour of a few of those spots, as selected by
Voit Gilmore, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CENTRAL FLORIDA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Too many Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles? An over-abundance of
Dick Tracyana? Too much Shamu? Impossible.
   To meet the Universal challenge, Disney-MGM has introduced a
live-character Muppet show, outdoor audience-participation
performances of those aggressive Turtles and a rousing musical show
based on the Dick Tracy characters.
   And Sea World is offering an all-new Shamu extravaganza, with
two _ count 'em, two _ underwater cameras to capture the whale at
work.
   Meanwhile, the $630 million Universal park, built on 444 acres,
has had its problems. Audience-involvement shows featuring Jaws,
King Kong and a San Francisco earthquake failed to operate on
opening day.
   Technicians fixed up Jaws in a day or two. They are reworking
the earthquake to make it more dramatic; it is not expected to open
until mid-July.
   ``Kongfrontation,'' the massive-scale Kong attack on New York
City, has overcome its computer problems. ``It will be the finest
ride in the business, period,'' says the park's general manager,
Tom Williams.
   Both parks have full movie and TV production facilities, with
Universal boasting the largest sound stage complex outside
Hollywood.
   ``I can't see anything in the near future that will hold down
the crowds,'' said Charley Ridgway, Disney's publicity director.

<HEAD>HAWAII:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   June, July and August traditionally are the heavy months for
Hawaiian tourism, and this year officials expect an increase of 3
to 5 percent in the number of visitors, says Gene Cotter of the
Hawaii Visitors Bureau.
   This is not ascribed to any new attractions _ no one has built a
Kilauea adventure ride, with mock lava spewing on appreciative
mainlanders.
   First-time visitors _ about 47 percent of the traffic _ usually
zero in on Oahu, the main island, and possibly one other island,
Cotter said. Their agenda is sightseeing _ luaus are still big _
and some beach time.
   The outer islands are prized by repeat visitors. There are few
tourist attractions; instead, vacationers must be satisfied with
the lush beauty of tropical islands.
   ``They really are beautiful places,'' says Mike Foley of the
Polynesian Cultural Center.

<HEAD>GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forget Yosemite. Forget Yellowstone. Great Smoky Mountains
National Park is the most popular national park in the country,
drawing 8.5 million visitors last year.
   This partly due to an accident of geography _ the park is within
a two-day drive of half the nation's population.
   But it also is testament to the park's 520,000 acres straddling
the Tennessee-North Carolina border, its 16 6,000-foot mountains,
its 975 miles of hiking trails (including 70 miles of the
Appalachian Trail) and 700 miles of fishable streams.
   It is hard to believe that a park of this size could be crowded,
but spokeswoman Nancy Gray said popular campsites are fully booked
on weekends a month in advance, and traffic on the two main roads
is growing.
   ``A high percentage of our visitors are the kind who stay in the
car and do a windshield experience,'' she said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEW YORK CITY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   People still want to see the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller
Center and Times Square, but that's not all. They have a hankering
to visit the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``Everyone wants to see that,'' said Jack MacBean, a spokesman
for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``I guess because
it's been in the news so much lately. All I know is that they had
to reorganize their whole tour schedule to handle the crowds.''
   Dave Hetland of Merced, Calif., and his daughters Christy, 19,
and Heather, 16, were among those eager to see the bastion of
capitalism.
   ``We've seen it in the movies,'' said Christy, who was posing
for pictures with her sister outside the Rockefeller Center skating
rink. ``It'll be neat to see what it's really like,'' her sister
added.
   They also wanted to view the United Nations, take a walking tour
of Greenwich Village and see ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.
   Myron and Holly Civils of Miami added one more stop: Trump Tower.
   Were they going to see the place or the man?
   ``The place, but if I get to see the man I'll be just as
happy,'' Mrs. Civils said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In New York, they're flocking to see the market that crashed in
1987. In Alaska, vacationers are boarding sightseeing boats that
will take them to the site of another disaster _ Bligh Reef, where
the tanker Exxon Valdez went aground last year.
   The resulting spill frightened the Alaskan tourist industry;
visitors had declined by 40,000 a year in 1987 and 1988, and there
was reason to believe tourism would join wildlife and the shoreline
as victims of the black goop.
   It didn't happen. Exxon poured thousands of dollars into tourism
advertising to counteract the pictures of polluted Alaska, and the
state launched a successful campaign to explain the size of Alaska
and point out the many uncontaminated places.
   Tourism rebounded to the level of 1986, when more than three
quarters of a million visitors came to Alaska.
   More than half of the Alaska visitors arrive with a package or
charter tour.
   Typically, these include lodging at Anchorage; a train ride
north to Denali National Park to see North America's highest peak,
Mount McKinley; a Prince William Sound boat tour to see glaciers;
``flightseeing,'' seeing Alaska by air from small planes; and
fishing excursions to the Kenai River or south central bays.

   Here are states ranking in the bottom half
nationally in several examples of risky health behavior, according
to a 1988 Centers for Disease Control survey in 36 states and the
District of Columbia.
   CDC researchers say the survey can indicate problem areas for
states to target in their health programs.
   Listed with the participating states are areas where they rated
worse than the national median. New Mexico was the only state that
was above the median in all these categories.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen pulled up in a car to a
mechanics' shop and killed three men with pistol and shotgun fire
in what police called revenge for a coffee bar shooting four years
ago, a news agency reported.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said another three men were wounded
in Wednesday night's attack in this town near Agrigento, a tourist
area of ancient Greek temples on the southern coast.
   ANSA said the three men killed in the attack were linked to the
Messina and Albanese organized crime families, who investigators
suspect carried out a shooting in a bar in September 1986. Five
people died in that shooting, including the reputed boss of a rival
crime family.
   The attackers in the latest shooting escaped in a large car,
which was later found abandoned and burned in the countryside about
6 miles from the mechanics' shop, ANSA said.
   The agency said one of the victims had served five years in
prison after being convicted of criminal association.

<HEAD>Some Common Sense Fireworks Precautions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back yard fireworks are banned or severely
restricted in a number of communities. But even legal fireworks can
be dangerous if mishandled.
   Here are some common-sense precautions from John Conkling,
executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association:
   _ Buy legal fireworks from reliable dealers.
   _ Follow label directions.
   _ Use fireworks outdoors and away from open gasoline containers.
   _ Children should be supervised by adults.
   _ Don't drink alcohol and use fireworks.
   _ Keep a bucket of water handy to put out grass fires.
   _ Never shoot fireworks in metal or glass containers.
   _ Don't try to reignite faulty fireworks.
   _ Never attempt to create homemade fireworks. Mixing chemical
powders can kill or maim.
   The National Council on Fireworks Safety said fireworks injuries
have declined in recent years, from 12,600 in 1986 to 9,700 last
year, according to estimates by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   High-powered firecrackers have been illegal in the United States
since 1966. Ten years later, federal regulations were issued
severely limiting the kinds of fireworks that can legally be sold
in this country.
   Thirteen states went further, banning fireworks of any kind.
They are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
   Some or all of the legal fireworks under federal rules are
allowed in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Seven states _
Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania _
allow only sparklers and other novelties, and fireworks are
regulated only by counties in Hawaii and Nevada.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germans racing toward unification are
anything but united over what city to make their capital: this
dowdy seat of the West's government or the vibrant but tainted
Berlin, once hub of Hitler's Third Reich.
   The issue has turned into one of the most sensitive to be
resolved in the frenzied work to join the two German states.
   ``It will be the last question decided,'' said Dieter Vogel, the
deputy government spokesman in Bonn.
   Some Bonn residents are lobbying hard to make their city, which
is already the capital of West Germany, the government seat of a
united nation. Some bumper stickers seen around the city proclaim
``Ja Zu Bonn'' (Yes to Bonn).
   Bonn's supporters say this city symbolizes a democratic and
peaceful Germany. They argue that Berlin is a bad choice because it
was capital of imperialistic Prussia and Hitler's Germany.
   However, Berlin's supporters sport their own stickers saying
``Berlin Hauptstadt Deutschlands'' (Berlin, Germany's capital).
   The list of leaders backing Berlin, the symbol of Germany's
postwar division, grows almost daily. It includes West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker, East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere and Willy Brandt, the charismatic former West
German chancellor and ex-mayor of West Berlin.
   Several polls indicate a majority of Germans also favor Berlin,
which lies in East Germany about 100 miles from the West's border.
   Although West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said he favors
Berlin, the government's official position is that the final
decision must come from the new German Parliament expected to be
seated after all-German elections proposed for December.
   Bonn is not giving up without a fight.
   ``Our chances are good,'' said Bonn Mayor Hans Daniels. ``It is
of course a battle of David against Goliath, but history teaches
that David can win.''
   A majority of the minister-presidents of the 11 West German
states also say they want Bonn to remain capital _ or at least the
seat of government, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported.
   The issue involves more than civic pride. The economic impact on
the Bonn area would be enormous if the capital is relocated, said
Klaus Rauen, Bonn's deputy city manager.
   He gave no specific figure, but he said about a third of the
local residents are directly dependent on the government, 126
embassies, political parties and lobbying. Thousands of others in
businesses ranging from restaurants to local shops make their
livelihood from government-related business.
   In addition, Rauen said the actual cost of moving the government
would be at least $30 billion. Bonn proponents say the money could
be better spent helping to bring East Germany's crippled economy up
to Western standards.
   The Bonn-or-Berlin debate also touches another, deeper level of
the German psyche.
   Bonn, made ``provisional capital'' when West Germany was founded
in 1949, lies along the Rhine River and seems to take its rhythms
from the slow-moving river.
   The city's population is about 290,000. But the greater Bonn
area, which has expanded over the years to dozens of little
villages, has about 450,000.
   A united Berlin would have a population of about 3 million. Long
a cultural mecca and counterculture haven, Berlin has an intriguing
mix of ethnic groups, a vivacious night life, grand architecture, a
famous symphony and deep historical resonances.
   But its history has provided fodder for Bonn's advocates.
   ``We, the Germans, carry a heavy historical burden,'' said
Rauen, who is coordinating Bonn's quiet crusade to retain the
capital. ``We know that the imperialistic, hegemonial claim with
which we are still connected by history still causes fear and
apprehension among our surrounding neighbors.''
   In the interview, he also argued that the success of West
Germany has been built on its ability to develop a ``balance of
power between the states and central government.''
   Berlin as capital ``would have a superpower influence'' over
Germany, he said.
   De Maiziere, however, says Berlin should be the capital to
promote the integration of future East German states and serve as a
bridge to the East.
   East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina said making Berlin the
capital would have symbolic importance for East Germans, who would
feel they had brought something to the union of the two countries.
   There have been recent suggestions of compromise. One proposal
involved moving the capital to Berlin but leaving at least some
working government in Bonn.
   An aide to Bonn's mayor summed up the city's thinking by saying:
   ``We have got the arguments, and if the arguments will win, we
will win. If the emotion will win, Berlin will win.''

<HEAD>Giant Old Glory Won't Fly _ It's Stored in Washington Warehouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of politicians could wrap
themselves in it. Thousands of schoolchildren could salute it. But
the U.S. government apparently has no use for the world's largest
flag.
   The 7.7-ton Old Glory was presented to President Reagan in front
of the White House on Flag Day in 1983. The president said it would
be unfurled once a year.
   Instead, the Washington bureaucracy gobbled up the Great
American Flag without even a burp.
   ``It's just tucked away in a big old building that's pretty much
unused,'' said Ted Leininger, in charge of storing the flag for the
General Services Administration.
   That doesn't fly with Len Silverfine, the man who conceived the
big banner and persuaded an Evansville tent maker to stitch
together 2 acres of super-strong red, white and blue polyester.
   The flag's stripes are 16 feet wide and 411 feet long. Each star
is 15 feet in diameter.
   Silverfine and the corporate sponsors he lined up gave the flag
to the White House on the condition it be unfurled each Flag Day at
the Washington Monument.
   ``I promise you your government will keep it and treasure it and
use it as a reminder of the greatness that is America,'' Reagan
said before he recited the Pledge of Allegiance in front of the
flag.
   The next year, the Great American Flag was shunted to the less
glamorous East Potomac Park. Then the banner was dumped in a dark
warehouse in a remote corner of Washington. It's been there ever
since.
   ``Here we have the flag always in the news, people thinking of
ways to legislate respect for the flag,'' Silverfine said. ``And
here we have the biggest American flag, which because of its sheer
size has the power to uplift the spirits. And it's sitting in this
big, almost empty warehouse.''
   Silverfine, who runs an advertising agency in New York, said a
few months ago a friend asked whatever happened to the big banner.
Silverfine tracked the flag to the warehouse.
   Now he's begun a campaign to liberate the flag. He's called
congressmen, business leaders and friends, urging them to write to
President Bush.
   The White House is looking into the matter but believes that
displaying the flag is the Interior Department's responsibility,
said an official in the White House press office who would give
only his first name, Howard. An official in Interior's Parks
Department who refused to be identified said Parks never received
instructions from the White House about what to do with the flag.
   Silverfine originally thought of making a giant flag while
teaching advertising at the University of Vermont. He thought the
flag should fly from the Verrazano Narrows Bridge in New York on
July 4, 1976, for the bicentennial.
   Silverfine had a flag made and strung from the bridge on June
28, but it didn't last a day. ``It just blew to shreds,'' he said.
   Photographs of the tattered flag brought a flood of donations
for a replacement.
   The Great American Flag, 22 percent larger than its predecessor,
was pieced together in Evansville by 350 Anchor Industries workers
who donated their time. It took six weeks to finish.
   The flag first was displayed in Evansville in 1980. Then it was
taken to 20 cities, heralded by marching bands, schoolchildren and
politicians.
   The flag was laid out in front of the Washington Monument in
1980. It welcomed the 44 Americans held hostage in Iran when they
landed on home soil in 1981.
   Unable to raise enough money to build a monument for the flag in
Washington, Silverfine turned it over to the White House.
   ``I took it for granted everything would be fine,'' he said. ``I
regret that now.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Want Proof More DOE Cleanup Money Will Get Job Done</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress say they want assurances
from the Energy Department that dramatic cost increases in cleaning
up nuclear weapons waste will yield a safer environment, not bigger
profits for contractors.
   The department said Tuesday it will take about 50 percent more
money and twice as many people as earlier projected to clean up
radioactive waste at weapons plants over the next five years.
   ``I think there is support on the (Capitol) Hill for this, but
people are going to start asking what is being cleaned up? What is
being accomplished?'' Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said Tuesday.
   ``I worry about how much of the money is going into the pockets
of the contractors and how much actual cleanup is being done,'' he
said.
   The report said cleanup will cost about $6 billion in each of
the next five years. It said the extra costs mostly resulted from
the discovery of additional waste as well as tougher regulations
that make the government and its contractors more vulnerable to
lawsuits.
   The revised five-year total through fiscal year 1995 will exceed
$28.6 billion, compared with the $19.5 billion the Energy
Department estimated in November, the report said.
   The price tag for 1992-1996 totals $31.6 billion, an estimate
that had not been available previously. The General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has predicted the overall
cleanup bill will total $150 billion to $200 billion over the next
30 years.
   ``There is nothing close to the required infrastructure
available to manage and implement these solutions,'' the DOE report
said, adding that all of the department's program offices were
understaffed.
   It said cleanup staff should be increased from 437 full-time
employees to more than 1,000, adding that the demand for personnel
``could easily take a decade to supply.''
   Leo Duffy, director of DOE's office of environmental restoration
and waste management, said some of the costs may have been inflated
for planning purposes and that the department will be seeking ways
to reduce them.
   But he also noted that costs could rise as scientists discover
additional contaminants produced at plants since World War II.
   ``I hope everyone realizes we are at the embryonic stage of
developing a plan to try to solve a 40-year backlog ... About 75
percent of the program is remedial investigation, which means we
are looking at each site to determine what the problems are,'' he
said.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees DOE, said lawmakers are ``not going to
just throw money at the problem.''
   ``But I think Congress will be very supportive of anything
dealing with the environment in this decade because our track
record has not been so good in the past and people are now starting
to realize it,'' he said.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, whose attention to the issue has been
credited with much of the department's recent activity, said he was
``not the least bit surprised'' by the escalating costs.
   ``After all, this is a problem that has been ignored for 40
years,'' he said. ``This is a problem that should have priority
because it is the most dangerous. We have to make a start, set
priorities and get going.''
   ``DOE clearly needs more money to deal with the problem, but
they also need more people who are skilled and talented enough to
handle the problem,'' said Rep. John Spratt Jr., D-S.C., chairman
of a special House Armed Services Committee task force on nuclear
weapons.
   ``In a few years, if the department has no real fruit to show
for all its expenditures, the support might fall off,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Golfing with George Bush is no
leisurely affair. It's golf on the go, from the first tee to the
18th green, a frenetic form of recreation that the local club pro
jokingly refers to as ``cart polo.''
   The president, who jets off tonight for the NATO summit in
London, golfed four days out of the past five as part of a
recreational regimen to ``get in shape'' for the diplomatic
marathon ahead.
   He also logged ample time on the tennis court outside his
oceanfront home and took his speedboat Fidelity out for daily spins
on the Atlantic.
   But golf has played an expanded role in Bush's sporting life
ever since Ken Raynor handed the president a long-handled putter
called a Pole-Kat last summer.
   ``It's been a savior for him,'' said Raynor, the 38-year-old pro
at the Cape Arundel Golf Club.
   The Pole-Kat allows a golfer to stand upright behind the ball,
instead of beside it, and stroke it with the single motion of one
guiding arm. For Bush, as for some senior pro golfers, it has
proven a cure for the ``yips'' _ a tendency to hit putts jerkily.
   Before ``he got that big Pole-Kat putter, golf was not fun for
him,'' said Willard S. ``Spike'' Heminway, 57, a textile executive
from Greenwich, Conn., and frequent Bush golf and tennis partner.
   Raynor estimated Bush's current handicap on the par-69 Cape
Arundel course is between 12 and 15 shots, meaning he would
customarily shoot 81 to 84.
   A year ago, ``he was picking the ball up more often,'' the pro
said.
   It's hard to say exactly what Bush's golf score is, for he
seldom finishes out every hole. He favors playing with partners by
``best ball'' rules in which only the lowest score in the twosome
is carded.
   Cape Arundel is no Augusta National or Burning Tree; it is a
rustic, 6,000-yard ``links'' course with only one par 5, 13 par 4s
and four par 3s.
   But it has its hills and knolls, and the Kennebunk River
meanders through it, posing a variety of challenges.
   A normal round of golf at Cape Arundel lasts 3 hours and 20
minutes, Raynor says. Bush seldom takes more than 2 hours and 20
minutes.
   ``We joke that it's cart polo or aerobic golf,'' the pro said.
   Heminway said Bush is ``fun to play with'' and ``very
competitive.''
   ``It's really wonderful that he can just shut out all the other
pressures and just think about golf. It's a great therapeutic thing
for him,'' said Heminway.
   Bush started a round Sunday grousing that he was in a foul mood
_ and finished boasting it was ``the second happiest day of my
life'' after a birdie on the 13th hole.
   Bush competes earnestly for the small sums _ $1 a hole and the
like _ he usually wagers.
   When he headed out Monday with an entourage including Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and Vice President Dan Quayle _ both
amateur golfers of no mean repute _ Bush hit one of his longest
drives off the first tee at Cape Arundel.
   ``No mulligans today. We're in a hurry,'' he quipped, abandoning
his customary practice of allowing repeat drives.
   Quayle, in fact, took a mulligan off the first tee,
double-bogeyed the ninth green and landed in a sand trap on the
18th _ the three holes the media witnessed.
   Bush rose to the defense of his vice president the next morning,
saying that off camera, Quayle got ``six birdies. That's pretty
good golf.''
   Despite Quayle's insistence that Bush won, Brady and Bush nephew
Joe Ellis actually carried the day. Bush excused Quayle's white
lie, saying, ``He was just being pleasant.''
   It was Quayle's first golf outing with Bush.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, on the other hand,
gets called out on numerous Bush golf outings, rain or shine.
Sometimes in nasty weather Scowcroft looks more like a hostage than
a willing participant.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, another visitor to
Walker's Point, was asked how he escaped golf duty.
   ``I'm waiting for the big game so I can take some big money off
him,'' said Sununu.

   A 21-year-old Marine who allegedly threatened
Washington's embattled mayor on Tuesday was ordered to undergo 48
hours of psychiatric evaluation.
   A Superior Court commissioner ordered the tests for Russell
Lobb, a Marine lance corporal, who was arrested last month at an
alcohol treatment center where Mayor Marion Barry attends
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
   Lobb participates in an alcohol treatment program at Bethesda
Naval Medical Center but was visiting the Next Step, the mayor's
center, with his support group when he learned Barry attended
meetings there.
   Lobb allegedly asked Barry's whereabouts, saying, ``I'm the
assassin. I am here to put him out of his political misery.''
   It was not known where Barry was at the time.
   Maj. Nancy LaLuntas, spokeswoman for the Marine Corps said Lobb
was in police custody and, ``Our understanding is that there is to
be a hearing scheduled for Thursday to determine his disposition.''
   Lobb, of Cockeysville, Md., is assigned to Headquarters
Batallion, Henderson Hall, a Marine instalaltion in Arlington, Va.
Henderson Hall is a support unit for the headquarters of the Marine
Corps.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney: Earth First! Permit Legal, in the Public Interest</HEAD>

   A legal foundation asked a federal judge
Tuesday to forbid Earth First! from holding its annual gathering in
a Montana forest, saying the U.S. Forest Service illegally issued
the environmental group a permit.
   The Denver-based Mountain States Legal Foundation is seeking a
permanent injunction barring the July 7-15 gathering in Beaverhead
National Forest in southwestern Montana.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell took the foundation's request
under advisement, and indicated he would decide later this week
whether the permit was legal.
   The foundation and 77 other groups representing ranchers,
loggers, miners and off-road vehicle users say the service should
not allow Earth First! in the forest, saying the group advocates
illegal sabotage against developers of wildlands.
   ``We know who these people are; we know what they want to do,''
William Pendley, an attorney for foundation, told Lovell.
   Pendley argued that Earth First! encourages tree-spiking, the
spiking of motorcycle trails, harassment of survey crews,
destruction of logging equipment and other sabotage. He presented
copies of pages from an Earth First! publication that contained
detailed instructions on these acts.
   Lovell agreed that tree-spiking and other acts of sabotage were
serious crimes, but asked Pendley for evidence that those attending
the gathering planned to commit such acts.
   Pendley said he had no evidence that illegal activities would
occur at the gathering, but said ``what we have is evidence of what
they have done in the past.''
   In a complaint filed Monday, the foundation said the Forest
Service should prepare an environmental impact statement on the
Earth First! request.
   However Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernie Hubley argued Tuesday the
group would be easier to control under the permit.
   ``Without a permit, the Forest Service says the impact on the
environment would be even more unpredictable,'' Hubley told Lovell.
   Hubley said the Forest Service not only followed the law in
issuing the permit, but also decided it would be in the public's
best interest to have Earth First! members meeting at one
controlled site.
   Organizers of next week's Round River Rendezvous in the
Beaverhead Forest say they're expecting hundreds of Earth First!
members from across the country.
   Pendley said his clients were worried about possible harm to
timber, cattle, and other resources.
   Hubley said those fears are unfounded, and that the foundation
and fellow plaintiffs therefore had no standing to ask for an
injunction.
   Philip Knight, an Earth First! member in Bozeman who helped
organize the gathering, said it would go forward regardless of the
court case.
   ``I don't see any way they can stop it,'' he said Monday. ``Word
has gone out all over the country, and there are people from all
over the country coming to it. ... We'll meet without the permit if
we have to.''
   Knight said Earth First! cannot control actions by all of its
members, and said the group as a whole shouldn't be penalized for
the actions of a few.
   ``At past rendezvouses, there have been no such incidents
involved,'' he said. ``Anyone engaging in it, I condemn them right
now.''
   Beaverhead National Forest officials approved a permit in April
for Earth First! to gather on a 30-acre site, and required the
group to post a $1,000 bond and prepare an emergency medical plan
for those attending. Knight said Earth First! has complied with the
requirements.

   Clad in helmet and flying suit,
Defense Secretary Tom King gave a thumbs-up sign from the cockpit
of a Tornado warplane ready for takeoff. He was the very picture of
gritty determination.
   He needed to be. These are gloomy days for the Tornado, pride of
the Royal Air Force.
   The fighter plane _ produced jointly by Britain, Italy and West
Germany _ is now itself a target of weapons-cutting proposals.
   In a new global climate, even Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
traditionally the most hawkish leader in the 16-nation Western NATO
alliance, is preparing to cash in on the so-called ``peace
dividend'' by slicing defense spending in the face of a collapsing
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   King's morale-boosting visit to the sprawling Cottesmore airbase
in central England, NATO's main Tornado training base, followed the
announcement last month that Britain has canceled an order for 33
Tornado aircraft.
   The move was part of a $1 billion cut in this year's $37 billion
defense budget.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who plays host to a NATO summit meeting Thursday
and Friday in London, is adamant that the Western alliance's new
role should include most of the old. She says it should remain a
defense alliance with nuclear weapons and U.S. troops deployed in
Europe.
   President Bush has also proposed cuts of $3 billion, taking
inflation into account, for a $303 billion U.S. defense budget. But
some congressmen want much larger reductions.
   The official reason given for canceling the Tornado order was
the high cost, which rose as Britain's annual inflation rate soared
unexpectedly to nearly 10 percent.
   But the post-Cold War climate made the decision easier for the
government, and officials acknowledge privately that it is just the
beginning of more sweeping cuts.
   The Conservative government is engaged in a major review of
defense spending. It is widely expected to herald big cutbacks by
Britain, long among the highest defense spenders in NATO.
   Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton sent shudders through the
military hierachy last month by telling Parliament that some of the
army's 75 regiments will probably have to be abolished or merged
into others.
   The spending review is being carried out in secret. But
according to widely reported leaks, Defense Procurement Minister
Alan Clark has proposed a radical program, including eventually
cutting the Royal Navy's surface fleet from 50 to 32 frigates and
the 150,000-member army by about a third.
   The cuts reportedly would include phased withdrawals of many of
the 66,700 British army and air force personnel based in West
Germany.
   Britain's 1991-92 defense budget, planned before the dramatic
political changes in Eastern Europe, was $39 billion. Now there is
speculation it will be frozen at $37 billion.
   The British cut in spending for the Tornado followed reports of
successive cancellations of orders by Jordan, Oman, Malaysia and
Saudi Arabia. That country reportedly wants cheaper British-made
Hawk aircraft and helicopters instead.
   British officials refused to confirm or deny the Saudi move. But
British newspaper reports said it could mean Tornado production,
which began in 1980, may end in early 1992.

   The Air Line Pilots Association says it will
ask federal investigators to reconsider their conclusion that the
pilot of USAir Flight 5050 caused the plane to skid into New York's
East River.
   The National Transportation Safety Board determined Tuesday that
the Sept. 20, 1989, crash that killed two passengers probably was
caused by the pilot's failure to detect a rudder control problem as
well as pilot errors in aborting the takeoff.
   The board said that despite the problem with the rudder setting,
simulator tests showed the new Boeing 737-400 could either have
taken off safely or aborted its landing without going into the
river.
   Fifty-five passengers and six crew members were rescued from the
river after the plane slid and split apart off the end of the
LaGuardia Airport runway.
   The pilots' union protested the board's decision, calling it ``a
total travesty,'' and said it would appeal to the board for
reconsideration. Board conclusions and recommendations carry no
force of law but serve only to advise other agencies on steps to
take for ensuring safety.
   Tom Kreamer, a USAir pilot who spoke for the union, said the
board should have blamed the crash on a design error in the plane's
control panel that allowed a rudder trim control to be improperly
set.
   ``Boeing played an integral part in this accident,'' said
Kreamer.
   The trim control determines the neutral setting for the rudder.
   After the crash, Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration
officials ordered changes in the controls to prevent them from
accidentally being reset by visitors in the cockpit or objects laid
on the console.
   The board said it could not determine how the rudder trim became
set in the full-left position before the USAir jet taxied onto the
runway.
   ``This lays a tremendous burden on one individual in a very
complex system,'' said board member John Lauber.
   But Lauber, with nods of agreement from other board members,
said the conclusion was justified because there were so many lapses
on the part of pilot Michael Martin during the incident.
   Martin aborted the takeoff as the plane started to drift to the
left with copilot Constantin Kleissas at the controls for the first
time on a commercial 737 flight.
   The board cited the pilot's decision to let his inexperienced
copilot control the nighttime takeoff, Martin's failure to engage
an automatic braking system, miscommunication in the cockpit,
improper use of nosewheel steering and the failure to have air
speeds called out during takeoff.
   The FAA suspended Martin and Kleissas' licenses, and the agency
was critical of their failure to appear for drug tests immediately
after the crash. Tests two days later were negative.
   Both men dropped appeals of the suspension. They continue to
work for USAir and will be allowed to fly again if they pass
recertification tests.
   Board member Jim Burnett joined in the 4-0 vote but filed an
additional assertion that USAir's failure to assign ``an adequately
prepared and seasoned flight crew'' was a contributing factor in
the crash.
   Burnett said the board did not cite design of the control knob
as a factor because the pilot had so many chances to discover and
correct it and because Boeing and the FAA already were correcting
the problem.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer says he won't let a
telegram from Mother Teresa or a demonstration by 3,000 abortion
foes sway him from vetoing the toughest state abortion law in the
nation.
   The measure approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature last week
allows abortion only to save the life of the mother. It would send
abortionists to prison for 10 years.
   Roemer has said he will veto the bill because it allows no
exceptions in cases of incest or rape.
   ``I've been basically pro-life all my elected lifetime,'' he
said Tuesday. ``The issue is a bill that's fair and the rights of
the unborn are important. But so are the rights of the living. I
don't know why this is a concept that is foreign to some.''
   Earlier Tuesday, about 3,000 abortion opponents rallied on the
Capitol steps to urge an override of Roemer's veto. The crowd heard
a telegram from Mother Teresa and a letter legislators said came
from the vice president.
   ``I thank you all for your quiet heroism and along with you I
look forward to the day when all children before birth will again
enjoy the protection of the law,'' said the letter.
   The governor's press office said he would probably veto the
measure on Thursday or Friday. By law, the legislative session must
end by midnight Monday.
   Roemer predicted his veto will be sustained. An override
requires a two-thirds vote of each house. No veto has been
overridden this century in Louisiana.
   He said that not even a telegram he received from Mother Teresa
would sway him.
   ``It was a powerful message,'' Roemer said of the telegram.
   It read, ``I urge your assistance in protecting all of God's
children. Please know, every child is from God and if they don't
want them, I will take them.''
   About 50 abortion-rights activists, including Norma McCorvey,
the ``Jane Roe'' of the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
recognizing the right to an abortion, held a news conference at the
Capitol against the measure.
   ``If the governor vetoes this bill, I urge the state Legislature
not to override his veto,'' said McCorvey. ``The sisterhood is
strong and very committed here in Louisiana.''

   About 2,000 residents of a town near
Marseille have signed petitions demanding the release of a woman
jailed for killing her son, who reportedly had forced her to
finance his drug addiction.
   Anne-Marie Siano, 49, has been jailed since June 22, five days
after she allegedly shot to death her 25-year-old son, Dominique,
in the town of Allauch.
   Among those signing the petition in the past few days were Mayor
Roland Povinelly, members of the town council, and co-workers of
Mrs. Siano, who worked in the mayor's office.
   Neighbors said Mrs. Siano and her crippled husband had been
harassed and threatened by their son, who for three years
repeatedly demanded money to buy more drugs. Mrs. Siano reportedly
began to suffer from depression and her weight dropped to 77 pounds.
   Judge Patrick Ardid, in ordering Mrs. Siano's detention, said
she should remain in custody pending the completion of
investigations into the circumstances of the killing.
   Organizers of the petition campaign said Mrs. Siano had been a
loyal mother and husband, and should be released as a humanitarian
gesture.

   Five straight nights of ``Quantum Leap''
exposed the NBC series to an estimated 60 million viewers and gave
it its highest rating yet.
   NBC entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff had scheduled
nightly reruns of the time-travel series last week in a offbeat
move to give better exposure to one of his favorite shows, but one
that has yet to prove its mass appeal.
   ``Quantum Leap'' achieved its highest marks ever with Thursday's
episode, which was the No. 12 program on television, according to
figures Tuesday from the A.C. Nielsen Co. The reruns were broadcast
Monday through Friday.
   The last original episode of NBC's ``FM,'' loosely patterned on
a National Public Radio station, was the No. 5 show on TV and the
only non-rerun in the top 10.
   ``Cheers'' on NBC was No. 1. ``A Different World,'' also on NBC,
was No. 2. CBS' ``Designing Women'' and ABC's ``Roseanne'' tied for
third.
   Fox Broadcasting had a bit of a letdown with ``The Simpsons''
and ``Married ... With Children.'' After landing for two weeks in
the top 10, the animated Simpsons dropped to 11th place and the
boorish Bundys of ``Married ... with Children'' fell into a
three-way tie for 14th.
   In the overall network ratings battle, NBC was No. 1 with a 10.4
average, followed by ABC with an 8.7 and CBS with an 8.6.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight with Peter Jennings'' was the
top-rated network news program for the 25th consecutive week, with
a 9.5 average. CBS and Dan Rather were a distant second with 7.9
and NBC and Tom Brokaw were third with 7.1.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.
   Here are the top 10 programs, their network and rating:
``Cheers,'' NBC, 16.8; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 13.8;
``Designing Women,'' CBS, and ``Roseanne,'' ABC, (tie) 13.7;
``FM,'' NBC, 13.5; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 13.3; ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC, ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, ``60 Minutes,'' CBS (tie), 13.2;
``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 13.1.

   Four inmates were killed and 15
seriously injured in a riot in a state penitentiary on Tuesday, and
about 60 convicts escaped in the confusion, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
   The agency quoted Chihuahua State's interior secretary, Sergio
Granados Pineda, as saying the riot began when drug traffickers
tried to set free jailed confederates.
   It said authorities were searching for the escapees with
helicopters, airplanes and automobiles and that roadblocks have
been set up on major highways. The penitentiary is in the state
capital of Chihuahua, 225 miles south of El Paso, Texas.
   The army, city, state and federal police assisted in putting
down the riot, the agency qouted Granados Pineda as saying.
   The official said the exact number of escapees was unknown, but
estimated it at 60. He said some were serving the maximum Mexican
prison sentence of 40 years.

<HEAD>Despite Criticism, Gorbachev Still Most Trusted Leader in Party</HEAD>

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is drawing unprecedented
attacks from all shades of reds at a turbulent Communist Party
congress, but even his critics say they will vote to keep him in
the top party job.
   ``If we have to vote, I shall vote for Gorbachev, simply because
there is no other alternative,'' said delegate Vitaly G. Karpenko,
echoing a sentiment heard across the spectrum in the Kremlin Palace
of Congresses.
   The 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is expected to
elect the party general secretary before it adjourns sometime next
week, and the smart rubles are riding on Gorbachev, who first won
the job five years ago.
   Hard-liners and radical reformers are gravitating toward
Gorbachev because both sides believe only he can prevent the
disintegration of the party.
   Some more philosophical delegates also say that despite
Gorbachev's reforms, the party seems to have room at the top for
just one major figure.
   Gorbachev's most prominent hard-line critic, Politburo member
Yegor K. Ligachev, said in nationally televised address two weeks
ago that Gorbachev should not continue to hold the government post
of president and at the same time head the Communist Party.
   But on Tuesday, in a blistering critique of Gorbachev's reforms,
Ligachev carefully avoided a personal attack on the Soviet leader
and did not repeat his demand to elect someone who could devote
full time to party work.
   KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, who followed Ligachev's lead
in attacking the reform movement, nevertheless told reporters he
would back Gorbachev for general secretary.
   Karpenko, a reformer, also criticized Gorbachev for ``combining
the posts of president and party leader'' and said, ``Gorbachev's
position is not radical enough.''
   However, he added, ``It is Gorbachev who will be able to
consolidate the country.''
   ``I can't name any other candidate now,'' said Karpenko, a
newspaper editor from Kiev.
   ``It is a great fault of the system that we do not have other
leaders. If there is one leader, all the others have to stay in the
shadows,'' he said.
   Valentin A. Gaivopovski, a worker from the Ukrainian city of
Mariupol, also said he planned to back Gorbachev despite
reservations.
   ``We do not have another leader of the same caliber,''
Gaivoposki said, appearing with Karpenko at a news conference
Tuesday by Ukrainian delegates.
   ``I think we will probably re-elect Gorbachev, although I think
that as a person he is probably not without his mistakes and
defects,'' said Gaivopovski.
   He praised Gorbachev's ``political qualities'' but faulted his
``ability to see through flattery, to spot fraud and deceit ... I
think that Gorbachev as a leader is very one-sided.''
   On the floor of the congress, delegates relied on Gorbachev to
navigate the relatively unfamiliar shoals of democracy.
   They chose Gorbachev by a 3,166-1,046 margin to be chairman of
the party rules committee, a body that will guide the outcome of
the congress.
   By contrast, Ligachev won a similar vote to head the agriculture
committee by the slimmer margin of 2,233-1,963.
   Delegates also favored Gorbachev when they demanded the removal
of the acting congress chairman, Byelorussian Communist Party chief
Yefrem Sokolov, accusing Sokolov of ignoring their wishes.
   Gorbachev told agitated delegates to calm down and said there
was no need for a formal vote to replace Sokolov.
   ``If you think we need a different person, we can replace him
with a more experienced person,'' Gorbachev said.
   Delegates cheered.
   ``If you allow, perhaps I'll change places with him,'' he
continued.
   Delegates cheered again.
   Gorbachev exchanged places with a shame-faced Sokolov, then
began to manipulate delegates balking at his wishes on minor
proposals.
   At first, Gorbachev scolded unruly members, but managed to
change mood and nudged them along with jokes and laughter.
   Asked to explain Gorbachev's appeal, Alexander Frolov, first
secretary of the Surovsky region near the central Russian city of
Tula, said: ``We have no other leader with more potential than
Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.''
   Pressed to explain the mixed attitude to Gorbachev, Frolov fell
back on an old Russian proverb: ``He who works is scolded.''

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Israelis who claimed they trained Colombians to
use firearms have been charged with attempting to smuggle 122
high-quality semiautomatic pistols to South America, federal agents
said Tuesday.
   The Israelis, brothers Geri and Shlomi Ben-Tov, both of Miami,
had been secretly shipping weapons overseas for some time, said
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms supervisor Ron Mitchell.
   Also arrested in the case were two Venezuelans, Rodrigo
Fernandez and Ilio Ulivi of Caracas, who allegedly received the
pistols from the Israelis on Monday. All four face charges of
violating gun and export control laws.
   ``This was an ongoing enterprise _ this was not the first
shipment,'' Mitchell said. ``From the records I observed, it was
the whole gamut of rifles and handguns.''
   Investigators said they were not sure how many firearms were
smuggled or how long the ring had existed because many of the
records are coded in computers at the Israelis' office.
   At one point, Mitchell said, the Israelis told undercover
investigators they were training Colombians in firearms use, but
the agent could not say if they had any connection to the cocaine
cartels. He said they did not appear to have any connection to
another Israeli, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, who fled Colombia after being
videotaped training alleged Medellin cartel gunmen.
   Meanwhile, an assault rifle seized in the arrest last year of
four suspected assassins of Colombian presidential candidate Luis
Carlos Galanhas has been traced by U.S. authorities to an official
Israeli arms shipment, New York Newsday reported.
   Although supposedly destined for the defense forces of the
Caribbean island of Antigua, a cache of guns from the shipment was
discovered earlier this year on a ranch owned by the late Colombian
drug boss Jose Rodriguez Gacha, Newsday said today.
   The Israeli government has maintained that it followed its
normal procedure in the $353,700 sale of 500 Galil rifles and Uzi
machine pistols and 200,000 rounds of ammunition to the 90-man
Antigua defense force and that it does not know how the weapons
were obtained by Gacha. Antigua said it never purchased the
weapons, Newsday said.
   Colombian officials are investigating the Israeli-made Galil
7.62-mm assault rifle in connection with the Aug. 18 slaying of
Galan, according to Colombian authorities and law enforcement
documents cited by Newsday.
   The weapon was one of several firearms and explosives discovered
by the Colombian police and military in two Bogota safehouses when
they arrested the four suspected assassins on Sept. 21, the
newspaper said.
   The four men accused in the Miami arms case appeared Tuesday
before U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson, who ordered the two
Venezuelans held without bond for a hearing Friday. The Ben-Tovs
each were granted a $350,000 bond but could not immediately make
bail. All four were being held at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center outside of Miami.
   The guns confiscated Monday included 101 Glock and 21 Beretta
semiautomatics, both equipped with 15-shot clips, and both weapons
of choice in many U.S. law enforcement agencies.
   ``We just don't see Saturday Night specials anymore,'' said ATF
spokesman Bruce Snyder. ``Because of the money available in the
narcotics trafficking we see Glocks and Berettas, high quality,
high-caliber firearms.''
   The Ben-Tovs, using their import-export company Express Spare
Parts &amp; Equipment Inc., bought the weapons from a legal, licensed
dealer in Miami that the ATF would not disclose. But neither they
nor the Venezuelans had licenses to sell or export weapons,
Mitchell said.
   The guns were bought for $46,500, but on the South American
black market were worth approximately $200,000, the ATF said. While
the Ben-Tovs indicated the guns were going by boat to Colombia, the
two Venezuelans said the weapons were first headed to their
homeland.
   Florida has long been a source for illegal weapons flowing to
Colombia, said Snyder, who estimated ``thousands and thousands'' of
guns end up in that South American country, many in the hands of
drug traffickers.
   A recent random check of 158 guns confiscated in Colombian
during 1989 found that 85 weapons, or 54 percent, originated in
Florida.
   ``Traditionally it has been dope in, guns out, and this is
another example of guns being exported from Florida,'' said Snyder.

<DATELINE>DADE CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 90-year-old who often argued with
others at the retirement home where he lived has been acquitted of
thrashing to death three fellow residents with his cane.
   Henry Thomas left the courtroom in his wheelchair Tuesday, a
free man for the first time since his arrest in blood-spattered
clothes the night of the New Year's Day 1989 slayings.
   ``Thank you to the jury and the judge,'' he said.
   Thomas had been charged with murdering three people with his
heavy oak cane. Two residents died at the scene, and a third, left
with a fractured skull, died a month later. Three others recovered
from their injuries.
   The defense had raised doubts that Thomas carried out the
killings or was even capable physically of the crime.
   Authorities said the retired fruit picker argued often with
other residents at the Reflections I home that housed nine people
some 30 miles northeast of Tampa. Thomas shared a 10-by-9-foot room
with two people.
   They said he became angry when, for example, his belongings were
moved.
   Thomas' lawyers helped him stand as the verdicts were read. He
lifted an index finger in a salute to the judge as he was declared
innocent.
   Defense attorney William Eble embraced Richard Thomas, Henry
Thomas' son, and told him: ``Take care of your dad. Take him home.''
   ``I turned this over to the Lord a long time ago. If this is his
will, then I accept it,'' said Charles Tear, whose father, Frank
Tear, died of injuries received in the attack at the home owned by
Charles Tear's wife, Helen.
   Prosecutor Phil Van Allen had no comment after the verdict.
   Thomas had said he saw and heard intruders and fled out the
front door when they began beating his roommates.
   Residents who survived had described the attacker as a young man.

<TEXT>
   Today's midweek Fourth of July meant only one day of
independence from work for many Americans _ a day for the
traditional fireworks and flagwaving as well as such offbeat
activities as stone-skipping and sandcastle-building.
   Other events included a blue-claw crab race in Tuckerton, N.J.,
and the cutting of a gigantic cake in Philadelphia. Lasers, not
fireworks, were to light up the sky over Atlantic City, N.J.,
tonight.
   Several communities staged their fireworks shows early this
year. Pittsburgh set off its rockets Tuesday night to save an
estimated $20,000 in overtime for police, paramedics and parks
workers.
   ``The administration thinks the most patriotic thing to do is
not to raise taxes,'' said Al Neri, spokesman for Mayor Sophie
Masloff.
   Kennebunkport, Maine, also held its fireworks show the night
before the Fourth _ for a presidential audience. President Bush,
whose summer estate is along the town's oceanfront, watched from
aboard a Coast Guard vessel.
   Bush's five-day stay in Maine was set to end before the holiday
did. He flies to London tonight for a NATO summit.
   Detroit staged its fireworks extravaganza on Monday night. About
1 million people flocked to the banks of the Detroit River for the
joint celebration with Windsor, Ontario, across the river.
   But Ridgewood, N.J., canceled its fireworks show for the first
time in 40 years after police said they couldn't hire enough
officers for crowd control. ``It was just getting out of hand,''
said police Capt. Anthony Cortazzo.
   Tourism industry officials were wondering how much they'd have
to cheer about.
   ``We have a pretty good crowd now, but the holiday coming in the
middle of the week is going to hurt some,'' said Mark Soifer,
spokesman for Ocean City, N.J.
   But Jane Phillips, director of tourism for Wildwood, N.J., said
some tourists were taking the unusual step of making reservations
for a five-day weekend. ``This weekend is lining up bigger than
years before,'' she said.
   On the boardwalk in Atlantic City, N.J., some people weren't
satisfied with having just today off. ``I guess I should be at
work,'' Sondra Washington of Philadelphia said Tuesday. ``The
weather is too nice. One day isn't going to matter.''
   For some cities, July Fourth was a time to think big.
   In Philadelphia, birthplace of the Declaration of Independence,
former President Carter was to join Mayor W. Wilson Goode in
cutting ``America's Birthday Cake,'' big enough to serve 25,000
people. Carter also was to receive the Philadelphia Liberty Medal,
which carries a $100,000 prize.
   Myrtle Beach, S.C., officials hoped to get enough beachgoers
together to build the world's longest sandcastle _ 10 miles long.
The city lost by 1{ miles last month when Long Beach, Wash., built
a world record 6.5-mile-long castle.
   The centerpiece of the sculpture was to be an American flag
tinted with Kool-Aid or hair color.
   Adults were to engage in another children's pastime on Mackinac
Island, Mich. _ skipping stones. Thousands were expected to
participate in the annual International Stoneskipping contest at
Windermere Beach.
   Among the contestants: Arthur ``Babe'' Ring, 75, who holds the
world record, 29 plinks and pitty pats set Aug. 4, 1984, on the
Russian River in California.

   A man lurking the streets with a homemade
blowgun has stung as many as 24 women with tiny darts fashioned out
of pins or needles, police say.
   ``We have no idea why he's doing this,'' Deputy Inspector Robert
Frankel said Tuesday. ``This whole thing is weird.''
   Police had earlier reported 10 women were stung in the backs or
the buttocks since June 26. Since then, 14 more women called to
report they had been hit by the dart-blowing man, seven of them on
Monday, police said.
   None of the women was seriously hurt, police said.
   The darts that have been recovered are being subjected to
toxicology tests. No traces of poison or other substances have been
found, police said.
   The victims, all dressed in business suits when they were hit,
ranged in age from 21 to 44, and most were stung on crowded midtown
Manhattan sidewalks in the afternoon, police said.
   Witnesses to two attacks said the man stood behind the victims
and blew a dart through a straw-like device.
   The dart was described as a needle or straight pin with paper
glued onto it.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inched up
Wednesday after narrowing its early gains in the afternoon, while
the dollar plunged against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended at 150.30 yen, down 1.38 yen from Tuesday's
151.68-yen finish. It opened at 150.25 yen and ranged between
149.90 yen and 150.65 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 31.32 points, or 0.10
percent, ending the day at 32,445.92. The index rose 254.37 points
on Tuesday.
   The Nikkei gained 100.66 points at the end of the morning
session but gradually fell as market players sold high-tech issues
due to the yen's appreciation, traders said.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's low opening followed its
similar weakness against major currencies in overseas markets.
   Japanese investors indulged in heavy stop-loss selling based on
their concern that U.S. interest rates are headed lower, said
Masaya Ueno, a Fuji Bank dealer. Lower interest rates tend to make
a country's currency less attractive to overseas investors.
   Other dealers said the currency moved in a narrow range as the
market waited for Washington's announcement of the U.S.
unemployment rate for June, scheduled for Friday.

   Former federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani
``guaranteed'' a conviction against Ferdinand Marcos in the case
that ended with the acquittals of his widow and Adnan Khashoggi.
   A State Department document obtained by The Associated Press on
Tuesday said the U.S. Justice Department had concluded ``the
evidence is sufficient to prevail. (Giuliani has ``guaranteed''
success.)''
   The former Philippine president died in September before the
case went to trial. But Imelda Marcos and Khashoggi were acquitted
Monday of fraud and racketeering charges.
   Mrs. Marcos had been charged with helping loot the Philippine
treasury of $222 million and secretly buy real estate, art and
jewelry. Khashoggi, a Saudi financier, had been charged with
helping her conceal real estate purchases.
   The State Department memorandum said Giuliani believed the
evidence was so strong that there was no reason to offer Marcos a
plea bargain.
   The 1988 document did not mention Mrs. Marcos or Khashoggi.
   Giuliani left his post as U.S. attorney in January 1989 and lost
the mayoral race to David Dinkins last November.
   Now at a law firm, Giuliani did not return a phone call Tuesday.
A secretary said it is his policy not to comment on cases from his
tenure as U.S. attorney.
   After the verdicts, Mrs. Marcos joined Khashoggi, 54, at a noisy
victory party in a restaurant complete with Arab food, champagne,
two bands, belly dancers, a whirling dervish act and a huge cake to
mark Mrs. Marcos' 61st birthday, which was Monday.
   Mrs. Marcos, famous for singing to her guests at parties, joined
in a duet of ``Ako ay Pilipino (I am a Filipino)'' with Imelda
Papin, a popular Philippines singer who left the country after the
Marcoses' ouster in 1986.
   Mrs. Marcos went to sleep around dawn, said one of her lawyers,
Benjamin Cassiday.
   On Tuesday, she left for the Hillsborough, N.J., home of her
friend Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress who loaned her a New York
City apartment during the three-month trial.
   The acquittal touched off speculation that Mrs. Marcos might
return home and even mount a political challenge to President
Corazon Aquino, who replaced Marcos.
   But Aquino said her government still considered Mrs. Marcos a
security threat and would not allow her back.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said a 1989 order by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
barring Mrs. Marcos from leaving the country remains in effect. He
said the ban was based on the potential for ``destabilizing
activity'' should she return to Manila.
   Khashoggi, meanwhile, headed to Palm Beach, Fla., and planned to
fly to France and then to Saudi Arabia, to visit Islam's holiest
shrine at Mecca.

   Radio stations in farm states Minnesota,
Nebraska and Iowa boycotting Grammy-winning singer k.d. lang
because of her appearance in a ``Meat Stinks'' advertising campaign.
   Patrick John, program director of KSUM-AM in Fairmont, said
Monday his station won't play lang's music until she disavows
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which put together the
campaign. The singer is a vegetarian.
   John said KSUM serves a major pork producing region and its
biggest supporters are farmers. Four stations in Sioux City, Iowa,
and North Platte, Norfolk and Lexington, Neb., have also said they
will boycott lang's music.
   A Sioux Falls, S.D., station tried a different approach. KXRB-AM
gave away filet mignon to callers each time it played one of lang's
songs Tuesday.
   ``We decided to take a different twist and still show our
disapproval and give people the opportunity to enjoy beef at the
same time,'' said Tony Randall, the station's farm director.

   Stan Cottrell, who once ran 3,000 miles through
China, is off on a jog from Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to Moscow's
Red Square.
   ``When you run, you promote friendship first, and peace is the
result of that friendship,'' Cottrell, 47, said before leaving for
Germany to start his run today.
   The opening of the Berlin Wall and other changes in Eastern
Europe made the run possible. Cottrell plans to complete the
1,300-mile run in 40 days. He will go through 40 cities, covering
26 to 44 miles a day.
   Cottrell has run more than 140,000 miles to promote peace. In
1984, he ran miles through China. The idea for the Berlin-to-Moscow
run came two years ago, when he ran across Vietnam.
   ``I can't forget what the Russian official who stayed with me
for several days said: `What you are doing with your run is one of
the most powerful forms of diplomacy I have ever seen. Would you
consider doing this in our country?'''
   ``Just ask me!'' Cottrell said he replied.

   George B. Peters, a dean of men at the
University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s and early 1960s, died
following a long illness.
   He died Saturday at age 75.
   Peters became the university's first dean of men in 1954.
   In May 1955 he led a crackdown on students who threw eggs and
stones at police when a traditional revelry called the Rowbottom
got out of hand. A discipline committee Peters headed suspended 20
students and put six fraternities on social probation for up to
nine months, meaning they could have no female visitors.
   He also served as a finish judge at the Penn Relays from 1934 to
1971.
   Peters became Penn's associate treasurer in 1961 and held the
position until he retired in 1978.
   During World War II, he survived the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and was awarded the Purple Heart. He was a
lieutenant commander in the Navy aboard the USS Maryland.

<HEAD>Maker Recalls Duck Pull Toys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York manufacturer is recalling more than
54,000 duck decoy pull toys because they may pose a choking and
sharp-point hazard to young children.
   The screw holding the duck's wing in place separated from the
10-inch decoy in tests, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Tuesday.
   The ducks, made of yellow and orange plastic by Artsana of
America Inc., have been sold nationwide since 1987.
   The toys have four wheels, movable feet, wings, eyes and beak
and make a quacking sound when pulled. The name ``Chicco'' is
printed in blue just above the duck's right wing and the packing
box is labeled in part: ``No. 63002.0 Decoy Duck Made in Italy,''
said the agency.
   Consumers are advised to return the ducks to the store where
purchased for a refund.

   Infant formula makers should reduce their
prices by 30 percent to prevent thousands of women and babies from
being dropped from a federally-funded feeding program, says Rep.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Infant formula prices have s risen nearly 150 percent in the
last 10 years, surpassing milk price increases of 36.4 percent,
grocery increases of 50.8 percent, and the 59.1 percent rate of
inflation, Wyden said Tuesday.
   About a third of the formula sold in this country goes to
mothers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Feeding Program for
Women, Infants and Children.
   Wyden said he wrote to the chief operating officers of the five

<HEAD>GAO Report Says $45 Million In Government Property Missing From</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $45 million worth of equipment,
ranging from typewriters to microcomputers, is missing from the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, says the General
Accounting Office.
   The GAO, asked to investigate charges that equipment was being
stolen from the federal laboratory to buy illegal drugs, said in
the report released this week that Livermore could not account for
27,528 items.
   The study is based on an inventory conducted last January, the
GAO said.
   Chemicals that could be used to make drugs are stocked at the
nuclear weapons research and development facility, but the GAO said
it could not identify any losses of such chemicals.
   The GAO said it could not confirm whether the laboratory was
missing any highly explosive materials and could say only that the
loss from the lab's inventory of $10.2 million in precious metals
was ``low.''
   Missing items from Livermore, the GAO said, total about 16
percent of the property listed in the laboratory inventory. It
noted many items are not listed in the inventory so losses from
this group could not be confirmed.
   Lawrence Livermore, located in Livermore, Calif. is owned by the
Department of Energy and operated by the University of California.
   In hearings two years ago before a subcommittee of the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce, there were allegations that
government-owned equipment was being stolen from Livermore to
finance purchases of illegal drugs.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was ordered to
conduct an investigation to determine how much property was missing.

<HEAD>Three Schools Will Become Teacher Training Grounds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Rochester,
N.Y., will be transformed into ``professional practice schools''
where fledgling teachers will get close, detailed attention instead
of the usual sink-or-swim training.
   The initiative was announced Tuesday by the American Federation
of Teachers at the 744,000-member union's annual convention.
   The schools selected by the union are Norwood Elementary in Los
Angeles, Henry High School in Minneapolis, and Marshall High School
in Rochester.
   Each school will receive $30,000 in grants from the Exxon
Education Foundation.
   Starting next fall, the schools will operate on much the same
philosophy as teaching hospitals in the training of doctors, said
Bruce Goldberg, co-director of the 2-year-old AFT Center for
Restructuring.
   Currently, most teacher trainees get sink-or-swim training with
occasional help from a mentor teacher.
   ``The professional practice school model will give student
teachers the opportunity to work in a clinical training site that
supports collegiality and inquiry for students and teachers,'' said
AFT president Albert Shanker.
   The notion of transforming schools into teacher training centers
has been supported by several teacher colleges in recent years,
said Goldberg. About 25 to 30 such collaborations have sprung up in
the last couple of years, he said.
   But this represents the first direct involvement by the AFT and
is the latest element in the union's push for radical school change.

<HEAD>Communists Reveal Billions In Holdings, Refuse To Give Them Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has for the first time
released an estimate of its holdings, which run into the billions
of dollars, and its leaders say they'll fight reformers who seek to
strip the party of its assets.
   Such demands are intended ``to weaken the party, deprive it of
its material basis and make it unable to engage in political
struggle,'' party Central Committee official Nikolai Kruchina told
Communist delegates Tuesday.
   Addressing the party's 28th Congress in the grandiose Kremlin
Palace of Congresses, Kruchina insisted that a new Soviet property
law guarantees that only an owner can dispose of property.
   The party said its property was valued at 4.9 billion rubles
($8.2 billion at the official rate). But the figure does not
include the luxury dachas and special stores for the party's elite.
It does count printing presses, schools, office buildings and
vacation retreats, all valuable in the political struggle.
   On Tuesday, Communist officials claimed the party has
accumulated its property with the dues of its members, who number
19 million.
   A document distributed to members also revealed that revenues
will plummet this year by as much as 1 billion rubles ($1.7
billion), largely because the party will be forced to pay taxes on
its network of 114 publishing houses for the first time. That will
force drastic cutbacks in the staff of 293,000, the document says.
   Most of the party's wealth is in real estate, including 5,254
local party buildings, the document says. The party owns 212
million rubles' ($355 million) worth of schools for teaching
Communist catechism as well as resorts and health spas worth nearly
twice that.
   The document does not disclose the party's most closely held
financial secret: the cost of luxurious second homes, chauffeured
limousines and exotic groceries for the party elite.
   But Kruchina did say the party would no longer pay for
officials' dachas.
   The most significant properties in the Communist portfolio are
the publishing houses. In much of the country, the party owns the
only printing presses, controlling publication of all newspapers,
magazines and books.
   For example, the Communist Party claims ownership of the only
printing plant capable of producing newspapers in the entire
republic of Lithuania.
   Democratic activists who have been threatening to break away
from the party if it does not reform in the coming weeks say they
will fight for their share of the spoils.
   Party official Alla Nizotseva won strong applause from the
delegates for rejecting that possibility.
   A leader of the progressive Democratic Platform, Moscow deputy
mayor Sergei Stankevich, predicted Monday that the issue would be
decided by the country's popularly elected legislative bodies.
   Many city councils and republic-wide parliaments, empowered by
popular mandate, are increasingly challenging the once dictatorial
Communist Party.
   The city councils of Moscow and Leningrad are among those now
controlled by reformers.
   The delegates' document says the party has been earning 1
billion rubles ($1.7 billion dollars) a year on its publishing
operations. But it says that the new Soviet tax law will cut that
profit to 200 million rubles this year.
   An official at the Central Committee said the party has never
previously paid taxes.

   People in Wisconsin lead a new coast-to-coast
survey in obesity, binge drinking and drinking and driving.
   The source is the Centers for Disease Control's annual
Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, a 36-state effort to measure
America's nasty health habits. The CDC released the results this
week.
   Americans in participating states were asked about the things
they do to jeopardize their health, such as smoking, staying fat,
going on drinking binges and not wearing seat belts.
   In Wisconsin, 28 percent of respondents said they were
overweight, according to the CDC. Twenty-five percent reported
``binge drinking'' _ five or more drinks in a sitting in the
previous month _ and 6 percent admitted drinking and driving.
   ``As far as for weight, it's really a Midwestern thing,'' said
Michael Soref, coordinator of the Wisconsin survey. ``Whatever it
is that makes the Midwest high on that ... applies to Wisconsin,
too.''
   In reporting the results, the CDC said unhealthy behavior
patterns vary considerably from state to state.
   In Kentucky, 34 percent reported they were smokers, worst among
the states. But just 1.4 percent reported drinking too much and
driving in the previous month, one of the best rates in the nation.
   ``For drinking, this is a very conservative state, with a lot of
religious conservatives. Alcohol has consistently been frowned
upon, and that has a lot to do with it,'' said Phyllis Skonicki,
manager of the Health Promotion Branch for the Kentucky Department
of Health Services.
   ``The tobacco issue is something else in Kentucky,'' she said.
``We're one of the largest growing states in the nation. ... From
the smallest farm to the largest, you're going to find some
tobacco.''
   Other survey extremes:
   _New Mexico is the slimmest state, with just 15 percent of the
respondents overweight.
   _New Yorkers don't have much inclination to exercise _ or maybe
they don't have much time. Seventy-four percent reported getting
less than three 20-minute sessions of leisure-time physical
activity a week. Washington state was best, at 45 percent.
   _Tobacco is taboo in Utah, where just 15 percent smoke.
   _Binge drinking is rarest in the nation's capital, just 7
percent. ``Heavy drinking'' _ 60 drinks a month _ ranged from 3
percent in North Dakota to 11 percent in New Hampshire.
   _Just 7 percent of Hawaiians ignore their seat belts, compared
with 67 percent in South Dakota.
   _In Maine, 58 percent have had their cholesterol checked,
compared with 41 percent in New Mexico.
   _And a 17-state survey of women and mammograms showed the
greatest use in Maine, where 68 percent of women age 40 to 49 had
had one. In Nebraska, it was 42 percent.
   The survey is intended to give states specific data to help them
measure progress in health behavior, said Dr. Eric Mast, a CDC
health surveillance specialist. The CDC hopes to have all 50 states
and all U.S. territories in the survey soon.

   A tavern owner is suing to force two of his
children to undergo tests to determine whether a donation of their
bone marrow could save their leukemia-stricken half-brother.
   Tamas Bosze of suburban Hoffman Estates has asked a judge to
order Nancy Curran to allow blood tests on the 3-year-old twins he
fathered. If their marrow is compatible, he also wants the judge to
order the twins to donate some to save the life of 12-year-old
Jean-Pierre Bosze, who was born to another woman.
   Curran, Bosze's former girlfriend, believes extracting bone
marrow from the twins would be risky, and she has refused to allow
compatibility testing.
   Arguments began in state court Monday and resume next week.
   The father's attorney argues the potential to save the boy
outweighs the risk involved in extracting marrow.
   ``When there's a chance to save a young life, we can't overlook
it, we've got to do everything we can,'' said Edward R. Jordan.
``If the twins can undergo a minimally invasive procedure to save
their half-sibling, I think they should do it.''
   Jean-Pierre's parents and another brother were tested and found
to be incompatible, Jordan said. Another half-sister by a different
mother is being tested.
   The boy's doctor, Jong H. Kwon, said that after intensive
chemotherapy, Jean-Pierre has relapsed and that his best chance for
survival is a bone-marrow transplant. The best chance of
compatibility lies with the twins, he said.
   Kwon, a pediatric hematology oncologist at Lutheran General
Hospital in suburban Park Ridge, said the risks in donating marrow
include pain; anemia; a possible need for a blood transfusion, and
infection.
   Curran has sole custody of the twins, and that gives her the
right to decide whether they will donate marrow, her attorney,
Beverly Pekala, said Tuesday.
   Bosze and Curran, a secretary, had lived together but broke up
before the twins _ a boy and a girl _ were born. During their
relationship, Bosze was married to another woman, who is
Jean-Pierre's mother.

<HEAD>At Least Three Killed In Rioting During Prison Break</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Armed inmates seeking to break out
touched off a riot at a state penitentiary in which at least three
people were killed and several dozen fled, authorities said.
   Most of the estimated 30 prisoners who escaped during Tuesday
afternoon's confusion were later reported to have been captured,
and authorities reported the 1,200-inmate facility quiet early
today.
   The escapees from the prison in the state capital of Chihuahua
included convicted murderers and drug traffickers.
   Reports conflicted on the number of convicts who fled and on the
number of deaths and injuries in the incident.
   Chihuahua state attorney general Jose Miller said authorities
had captured 19 of 32 fugitives, the independent news agency
Excelsior reported. It quoted Miller as saying three inmates were
killed and nine injured in the riot.
   The newspaper Diario de Chihuahua reported that two prisoners
and two guards were killed during the melee, and 34 prisoners
escaped. Twelve escapees were still being sought early today, it
said.
   Sergio Granados Pineda, Chihuahua state's interior secretary,
initially estimated that 60 prisoners had escaped and said four
were killed and 15 injured, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
   Authorities in Chihuahua, 225 south of El Paso, Texas, could not
be reached for comment by The Associated Press.
   Miller was quoted by Excelsior as saying convicted drug
trafficker Juan de Dios Levario Quiroz was suspected of instigating
the riot. He said Levario was killed in the jailbreak.
   ``Apparently it was all planned. Several prisoners had guns and
two vehicles awaited them outside,'' Diario de Chihuahua news
editor Leo Zavala said by telephone. Prisoners apparently held
guards at gunpoint, Excelsior quoted Miller as saying.
   The search for the escapees was conducted with helicopters,
airplanes and automobiles ansd roadblocks were set up on major
highways, Notimex said.
   Granados Pineda was quoted as saying the army helped city, state
and federal police put down the riot. He said the prisoners were
under control late Tuesday. He said some of the escapees were
serving the maximum Mexican prison sentence of 40 years.
   Among the fugitives being sought late Tuesday night was Alfonso
Parga Palafox, convicted of drug trafficking, seven murders in
Mexico and five murders in the United States, Zavala said.
   Also free was Gerardo Noe Payan, who had been convicted of
killing three Chihuahua university students in 1987, he said.

<TEXT>
   A member of the jury that cleared Imelda Marcos
says jurors were influenced by supposedly off-limit news reports
that the judge had expressed doubts about whether the case belonged
in a U.S. court.
   ``Everybody knew about that,'' Alan Belofsky said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``It was even quoted by one or two people.''
   Asked if U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan's comments
influenced jurors' thinking, he said, ``I'd assume so.''
   On Monday, another juror, Thomas O'Rourke, said after the
verdict, ``We are not big brothers to the people overseas. It was a
totally silly case.''
   The jury acquitted the former Philippines first lady and Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi of racketeering and fraud. Mrs. Marcos
was accused of helping loot her homeland of $222 million and
sinking the money into art and real estate.
   Belofsky, a 41-year-old letter carrier from the New York suburb
of Bronxville, said nobody on the panel liked or trusted Mrs.
Marcos' chief attorney, Gerry Spence.
   ``He lied to us. He lied to us an awful lot,'' Belofsky said.
``Spence should not think that he won the case. It was that the
prosecution didn't give us enough evidence, the right evidence.''
   Belofsky also said jurors were aware of Keenan's doubts about
the case being tried in New York instead of in the Philippines.
   On June 20, Keenan wondered, out of the jury's presence, ``what
this case is doing in an American court.'' His remarks were
reported in news accounts where jurors, though admonished not to
read about the trial, could see them.
   Belofsky said the panel found Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
LaBella's delivery bland and confusing.
   ``Just as we'd start to think about one subject, they'd jump to
another one,'' he said.
   He said a ``consensus'' of jurors thought Mrs. Marcos knew about
the huge thefts attributed to her husband, the late Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   She ``probably was a little bit guilty, but there wasn't enough
evidence. I'm not going to put somebody in jail on the basis of
that,'' Belofsky said.

   School reform sounds great, but teacher union
leaders from three cities in the forefront of change say they've
learned the headaches may be as numerous as the gains.
   Turf wars with principals and other administrators, lack of
training and planning, a shortage of money and even flak from
fellow teachers are a few of the pitfalls reformers have been
encountering.
   So said teacher union members Tuesday from Dade County, Fla.,
Rochester, N.Y., and Hammond, Ind., districts that have gotten high
marks for their reform efforts.
   Addressing a workshop at the American Federation of Teachers
annual convention meeting here this week, local union president Pat
Tornillo of Dade County said an added problem is that the public
expects a quick fix.
   For three years, teachers in Dade have gained authority over a
wide range of issues in 155 of the 275 schools.
   ``Have we turned test scores around? Has there been some kind of
miracle as a result of these reforms? No. It takes more than three
years,'' Tornillo said.
   Adam Urbanski, president of the AFT local in Rochester that two
years ago obtained a contract instituting numerous reforms and
raising salaries for top teachers to over $70,0000, warned that
``in search of reform, you're likely to encounter shortages of
ideas more often than shortages of money.''
   He told teachers to expect ``tremendous turf wars.
Administrators believe they have less leadership if they share it.''
   In Rochester, Urbanski said, poor parents were sometimes
mistrustful of reform. They wanted the kind of education rich kids
get; they didn't want to be the guinea pigs for the latest reform
fads, he said.
   In Hammond, a district with chronic money problems that 10 years
ago was among the first to try school-based governance, AFT
president Patrick O'Rourke said that perhaps one-third of the
teachers have grown so cynical and powerless they resist change.
   ``Having said all that,'' Tornillo said, ``come on in, the
water's fine. If we don't try reform, the public schools as we've
known them won't survive.''

   A pilot radioed he couldn't see Mount
Rainier minutes before his charter plane slammed into the
cloud-shrouded peak, killing four champion calf-ropers en route to
a rodeo in Canada, authorities say.
   The single-engine plane plowed into a glacier Monday at the
12,500-foot level of the 14,411-foot mountain.
   An Army helicopter brought the bodies of the five men down from
the mountain on Tuesday.
   The cowboys had chartered the plane to go to a rodeo in Ponoka,
Alberta. The Ponoka Stampede is the last big rodeo in Canada before
the big Calgary Stampede, said Keith Hyland of the Canadian
Professional Rodeo Association.
   The four were chasing the prizes of Cowboy Christmas, a 10-day
stretch in which a competitor may hit a dozen shows and make 20
percent of his annual earnings.
   Minutes before the crash, pilot H.R Card had radioed to air
traffic controllers that he couldn't see the mountain, said Bill
Hamilton, assistant secretary of the state Department of
Transportation's Aeronautics Division.
   Card was told to take evasive action. But moments later contact
was lost, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mitch
Barker.
   Killed besides the pilot were Dave Smith, 31, of College Place;
David Bowen, 28, of Yoakum, Texas; Randy Dierlam, 29, of Seadrift,
Texas, and Mike Currin, 25, of Hermiston, Ore.
   Bowen was the sixth-ranked PRCA calf roper last year. Dierlam
was No. 10 and Smith 18. Currin was PRCA Resistol rookie of the
year in 1987.

   A former supervisor at a Nazi rocket factory
where thousands of slave laborers died has come to Canada in an
attempt to win back his U.S. citizenship, his supporters say.
   Six years ago 83-year-old Arthur Rudolph renounced his U.S.
citizenship and went to West Germany amid allegations he persecuted
the laborers. He arrived in Canada on Sunday.
   Rudolph was to meet today in Niagara Falls, Ontario, with
Congressman James Traficant, D-Ohio, who supports Rudolph's bid to
return to the United States, where he helped develop the rocket
that put Americans on the moon.
   The meeting's border setting and the date, Independence Day,
were deliberately chosen to try to build support for Traficant's
call for congressional hearings to review evidence against Rudolph.
   Traficant claims a 1947 Army investigation absolved Rudolph of
war crimes.
   One of Rudolph's supporters said about 20 citizens would be in
Niagara Falls for the meeting with Traficant.
   The supporter, Cindy Bendall, said Rudolph was considering
walking across the bridge to the United States, which could lead to
his arrest.
   Rudolph has been accused of persecuting workers, including
concentration camp inmates, at the German Mittelwerk underground
rocket factory between 1943 and 1945.
   The West German government, after reviewing the U.S. Justice
Department's material and interviewing more than 50 witnesses, was
unable to prove him guilty of war crimes.
   He was detained for 9{ hours by customs officials at Toronto's
Pearson International Airport after he arrived from Hamburg, West
Germany, on Sunday.
   A senior immigration official said the Justice Department had
alerted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about a month ago that
Rudolph was headed for Canada. The tip came after Traficant
announced that he would try to get Rudolph back into the U.S.
through Canada, a Justice Department spokesman said.
   Traficant made the announcement at a May 12 dinner in
Huntsville, Ala., Rudolph's former home, where 140 supporters paid
$20 each to raise cash for a possible legal battle.
   The northern Alabama city is home to NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center, where Rudolph and other scientists who worked on
Nazi rocket weapons developed rockets for U.S. moonshots.
   Rudolph is believed to be the first person facing deportation
from Canada under a 1988 amendment to the Immigration Act barring
war criminals, an Immigration Canada spokesman said.
   His immigration hearing is scheduled to start Friday, but it
will likely be adjourned to another day, the spokesman said.
   Major Canadian Jewish groups called for the government to deport
Rudolph.
   ``We think he should have been put on the next plane back to
Hamburg,'' said Sol Littman, Canadian representative for the
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who is based in Los Angeles.
   Rudolph agreed to leave the United States in 1984 after signing
an agreement conceding his citizenship was illegally obtained.
   Rudolph now says the statement was coerced from him and that he
was told his pension and the citizenship of his wife and daughter
would be jeopardized ``if I do not do as they said.''
   U.S. Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said Rudolph
signed the declaration voluntarily after consulting a lawyer.

   Nearly 400 inmates were evacuated under
watch by SWAT team officers as a fire blamed on a workman's propane
torch destroyed a 100-year-old section of the city jail.
   Two firefighters and a guard suffered minor injuries in the
blaze Tuesday at a medium-security sector of the 1,000-inmate
Bridgeport Correctional Center, authorities said.
   The fire broke out in the oldest of the jail's five buildings, a
three-story, wood and brick structure. It was brought under control
more than four hours later.
   Fire officials said the blaze apparently started on the roof,
where workers were using propane torches.
   SWAT team officers were sent to oversee the evacuation, which
was described as orderly. About 30 state troopers were put on
standby.
   Anxious relatives of inmates gathered outside, awaiting word of
loved ones.
   ``I'm counting on God,'' said Mildred Ramos of Bridgeport, whose
son is an inmate.
   Most of the 375 inmates evacuated to a gymnasium will be
transferred to other jails, said Correction Department spokesman
Bob Wheeler.
   ``It will create a burden, but right now we have a luxury of
extra beds being available,'' he said.

<HEAD>Historic Meeting Ends With Agreement On Presidential Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Nationalist Party and its
opposition ended a historic meeting today by agreeing that all
Taiwanese should choose the next president instead of aging
Nationalists from mainland China.
   The week-long National Affairs Conference ended with a joint
statement in support of popular presidential elections and other
democratic change. For four decades, the political system has
guaranteed Nationalist rule.
   ``The democratic trend is irresistible,'' said Chang Chung-hung,
secretary general of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
``We have just had a peaceful revolution to gain democracy.''
   Less dramatic progress was made in discussions on relations with
China. The conference urged more trade and cultural exchanges but
cautioned against official talks on reunification before the
Communist government in Beijing agrees to end its policy of
isolating Taipei diplomatically.
   President Lee Teng-hui said he would support the recommendations
reached by the 140 politicians and academics at the conference.
``This is the time to act,'' he told the delegates in a closing
speech.
   Lee called the meeting after student demonstrations in March
protesting his election to a six-year term by an electoral college
dominated by aging Nationalist Party members.
   Most members of the electoral college last ran in elections on
the Chinese mainland shortly before they fled to Taiwan in 1949,
defeated by the Communists in civil war.
   They were subsequently frozen in office to support the
Nationalist claim to still be the legitimate government of all
China.
   The opposition has long argued that popular presidential
elections are necessary to give full political power to the native
Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of the island's 20 million
people.
   Many Nationalist delegates to the convention proposed direct
presidential elections after Lee's term ends in 1996, but some
supported an even earlier date.
   At a concluding session broadcast live on television, convention
delegates also supported direct elections of the mayors of Taiwan's
two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.The posts are now
appointed by the Nationalist government.
   Delegates also supported an earlier Nationalist proposal to
retire by 1991 all 800 elderly members from mainland China who sit
in the lawmaking Legislative Yuan and electoral college.
   Officials said a task force of representatives from the major
parties would be set up to settle remaining differences on the
democratic reforms.
   One unresolved issue is whether the electoral college should be
abolished, as proposed by the opposition, or should be transformed
into a symbolic institution that would reflect the popular vote but
still reserve a few seats for deputies purportedly representing
mainland China.
   President Lee told the 140 politicians and academics attending
the convention that he would back their proposals. Opposition
delegate Hsu Hsin-liang said Lee would have to keep his word even
with an expected backlash from the conservative Nationalist old
guard.
   ``He has issued a check to all Taiwanese and cannot afford to
have it bounce,'' said Hsu.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Turin brawl. Picks up 8th

   Italians were shocked and bewildered over their
elimination in the World Cup soccer semifinal, reacting with tears,
anger and defiant chants.
   Italy's dream of a fourth World Cup title was shattered Tuesday
night when its team lost a penalty kick shootout to Argentina 4-3,
breaking a 1-1 tie.
   Italians watched their TV screens in disbelief.
   ``In other countries soccer is only a game. Here in Italy soccer
is something in the heart. I cannot describe how bad I feel,'' said
Emiliano Mari of Rome.
   In Turin, police used tear gas early today to disperse about
1,000 Italians who broke down a gate and attacked English fans
sleeping in a park, witnesses and officials said.
   The other semifinal, between West Germany and England, was to be
played in Turin today.
   Forty-three Italians were arrested, said Turin police chief
Antonio Beradino. Three Italians and a policeman were reported
hospitalized. An undetermined number of English suffered minor
injuries.
   The streets were eerily quiet in Rome, where thousands of people
have noisely celebrated every Italian triumph with flag-waving,
horn-honking processions. The ``Azzurri'', or Blues, last won the
World Cup in 1982.
   Two young men on a motorscooter yelled ``forza Italia!'' (power
to Italy), but their heart was clearly not in it and there was no
response from the few pedestrians on the street.
   Three young joyously shouting ``Argentina, Argentina!'' on a
street in the center of Rome got only insults from passing Italians.
   Many bars and restaurants closed early _ without the crowds of
celebrating fans there was no reason to remain open.
   Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who watched the game from the
VIP seats at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, tried to put the best
face on the defeat in a tournament his government has spent
unspecified billions of dollars to host.
   ``There is sadness but a third or fourth place at the World Cup
cannot be dismissed,'' said Andreotti.
   Even before the defeat there had been some grumbling in Italy
about the World Cup, about the problems caused by
tournament-related construction, about the money spent by the
government to host the tournament.
   Merchants, hotel operators and restaurant owners all over Italy
have complained that the tournament has not produced the promised
surge in tourism and in fact that both tourism and profits had
declined.
   ``It's true that the Italian dream is finished. But it's only a
ball game. Now we can get on to more important things,'' said one
Roman, gesturing to the dog he was walking in a park.

<HEAD>Party Congress Calls on Miners Not to Strike, Asks Gorbachev to
Talk to Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party congress passed a resolution
today appealing to disgruntled coal miners to halt plans for a
strike next week to press demands for more far-reaching reforms and
better living conditions.
   The 28th Communist congress, in a stormy session over the
party's future, said the threatened strike by up to 1 million
miners ``could lead to the break-up of the country's economy,''
Soviet television reported.
   The miners have said the show of force will last less than one
day.
   The party's appeal, passed by a margin of 3,514 to 354 on the
congress' third day, also urged President and party leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to open talks with the miners.
   A national miners' congress last month voted to strike unless
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and his Cabinet resign. They blame
Ryzhkov for an unpopular economic reform plan that calls for
drastic price increases but only minor moves toward a market
economy.
   A crippling coal miners' strike last summer ended after the
government promised reform, but miners say the changes have been
slow in coming.
   The resolution also criticized the miners for their mass exodus
from the party _ which claims to be the vanguard of the workers _
and for locking party organizations out of the mines, Soviet
television reported.
   The miners' congress in June had condemned the Communist Party
for hindering the development of a more democratic Soviet society,
saying an exodus from a party of diminishing credibility was
understandable.
   ``We are workers, but we do not consider the Communist Party in
its present form to be our party,'' the miners' declaration said.
   Progressives in the party say it is fast becoming irrelevant in
the face of burgeoning democratic movements in many of the 15
Soviet republics and victories at the polls that have given
reformers control of the governments of major cities including
Moscow and Leningrad.
   Speakers at the conservative-dominated Communist Congress heaped
more stinging criticism on Gorbachev on Tuesday.
   Hard-line Politburo colleagues charged that his five years of
reforms haved been scarred by ``limitless radicalism.''
   Yet the 59-year-old Soviet president, who has been gradually
shifting political power to government bodies from the
long-dominant party, appeared unperturbed. Gorbachev won election
Tuesday as chairman of the party rules committee, and he joked and
laughed at times.
   Across Moscow on Tuesday night, reformers rallied to declare the
Communists irrelevant and demand that they move aside.
   More than 4,000 demonstrators gathered and cheered speakers
including Moscow City Council member Valery Fadeyev, who shouted:
``Down with the bandits who captured power in 1917!''
   The crowd cheered lustily at any mention of Boris Yeltsin, the
radical president of the Russian republic, who was not present. It
whistled derisively at references to the KGB secret police and
conservative leaders.
   Reformers want the party to remove its cells from the police and
military.
   Despite the attacks from hard-liners and threats of a split from
progressives, the delegates' stampede toward the center continued
today.
   A poll found most delegates believe all supporters of socialism
should rally around the Communist Party, rather than split off as
some reformers are threatening, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   The survey also found most delegates alarmed ``by an absence of
clear theoretical goals and the leadership's slowness in taking
decisions,'' Tass said.
   Leningrad hard-liner Boris Gidaspov told the delegates that
``time is needed'' to implement the party's decision to transfer
some of its power to elected officials. He said local governments
should have strong executives comparable to the the presidency that
gave Gorbachev enhanced powers in March.
   Delegates murmured impolitely at Gidaspov's speech.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a well-known reformer, told
reporters in the marble lobby of the Palace of Congresses, ``There
must be a platform of consolidation'' at the party congress.
   He said he was leaning toward electing Gorbachev to continue as
party leader even though he generally opposed the idea of the same
person leading both the party and the state.

   Medical assistant Allison Forciea had
given her father up for dead _ until she saw her birth name
tattooed across a patient's chest.
   Forciea was born Edith Josephine 30 years ago but got a new name
when her father gave her up for adoption when she was 2. She was
shocked when she saw ``Edie Jo'' tattooed on George Jensen Sr.'s
chest.
   ``When I realized who this person might be, I kind of had to
leave the room,'' Forciea said.
   Forciea said she was afraid about how her father would react.
Her anxiety turned to happiness when he turned to her and said,
``If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to get to know you better.''
   Jensen, who was seeing an orthopedist for a minor ailment, also
had had no word of his Edie Jo until their chance encounter June 5.
   ``There's got to be a higher being that's pushed us together,''
Jensen said Monday. ``This just doesn't happen by accident.''
   The newly found father, who left the appointment with tears in
his eyes, said he couldn't believe his luck at finding the daughter
he had wondered about for nearly three decades.
   ``I was ready to go buy a lottery ticket that day,'' said
Jensen, who lives with his third wife in Vallejo, about 70 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   Forciea found her biological mother, Lois Payne, in 1985, and
has been in touch with her since.
   ``I always knew I would find them, since I was 10,'' Forciea
said.
   Now, she can't stop talking to her dad.
   ``Twenty or 30 times a day, I want to pick up the phone and talk
to him,'' Forciea said Monday. ``And it's not like I have anything
super important to say. I just want to hear his voice.''
   Forciea had been told her father was dead and believed he was
until she saw the names ``George Jr.'' and ``Edie Jo'' tattooed
across his upper chest.
   Forciea's older brother was 4 when he and his sister, then 2,
were given up for adoption. George Jensen Jr. will be coming from
San Diego for a family reunion at a park there.
   The elder Jensen and his first wife were a struggling young
couple with a failing marriage when they decided to give up their
children rather than attempt to raise them without financial means,
Jensen said.
   ``We were just unable to take care of them, so we found a family
that could,'' Jensen said. ``I talked and thought about them many
times. I thought about finding them.''

filed by journalists in Monrovia, including Associated Press
reporter Michelle Faul.</NOTE>

   Rebels say they are moving
reinforcements and heavy artillery to the capital, where fighting
has intensified amid reports President Samuel Doe has agreed in
principle to resign.
   Sporadic firing was heard early today in several areas on the
city's edge, said the Christian missionary radio station, ELWA,
monitored in neighboring Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
   The radio said some gunfire was heard near its facilities
several miles outside the city, but no information was available
from government officials.
   Political sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday that Doe agreed to step down if his safety and that of his
minority Krahn tribe are guaranteed.
   But they said rebel leader Charles Taylor, a former Doe aide,
would likely have trouble restraining his people's desire to take
revenge after a bitter 6-month-old civil war in this West African
nation.
   A rebel source in neighboring Ivory Coast said 800 insurgents
were involved in attacks on Monrovia on Monday and several thousand
more were advancing, bringing heavy artillery with them.
   For Monrovia residents, who have been without water for a week
and without electricity since Friday, life got more difficult.
Shops remained shuttered and barred. People went out briefly to
search for food and water before retreating to the safety of their
homes.
   Four U.S. warships carrying 2,000 Marines are off the Liberian
coast, and the United States has offered to evacuate Doe if he asks.
   Doe's adminstration has asked the United States to intervene on
several occasions, but Washington has declined.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Tuesday they believe Doe's
government could collapse within days. The officials, who asked not
to be identified, said there had been a number of desertions from
the elite unit of about 500 fighters that protects Doe.
   A rebel leader in the United States, Tom Woewiyu, said the
insurgents would not oppose a U.S. evacuation of Doe, who has ruled
Liberia since taking over in a bloody coup a decade ago.
   ``If they can help him, God bless him. If they can't, we'll get
him,'' Woewiyu said. ``If they can send a hook from the heavens to
pull him up and take him out, fine, we wouldn't mind that. We can
try him later.''
   There were no reports of fighting Tuesday in Monrovia itself,
where Doe was holed up in his heavily fortified executive mansion.
   But the fighting continued two miles north of Monrovia's port,
and further west on the road to Sierra Leone near the Hotel Africa
_ the city's biggest hotel complex. Sounds of those battles could
be heard in the city center.
   There also was fighting in Paynesville suburb, within eight
miles of Doe's fortified Israeli-built executive mansion.
   The mansion overlooks the Atlantic ocean.
   Western military sources said rebels who surrounded the city's
landward sides Monday had not advanced. It was unclear whether the
rebels were regrouping, or if they were awaiting reinforcements.
   Soldiers sent to put down the rebellion have turned on civilians
from the Gio and Mano tribes _ to which many rebels belong _
pillaging homes, killing and raping. Rebels have retaliated by
killing Krahns and those of the wealthier tribe of Mandingos,
accused of supporting Doe.
   Diplomats said that at the country's Coca Cola factory on the
outskirts of the Paynesville suburb, rebels who advanced past the
bottling plant Tuesday were hunting for Mandingos and Krahns.
   The same thing happened at the U.S. government's Omega tracking
station _ one of only seven of its kind in the world _ just north
of Paynesville.
   Diplomats said rebels demanded that staff at the station hand
over Mandingos and Krahns, but went away when they refused.
   A statement from the diplomatic corps demanded that the
government halt further abuses of human rights, cease the murder of
innocent civilians, and end army harassment of refugees at the
centers.
   Unruly troops, many drunken or drugged, looted several shops
Monday night under cover of a dusk-to-dawn curfew, shopkeepers said.
   On Tuesday, they terrorized the city, shooting from commandeered
cars and extorting money from passers-by.
   In 1980, Doe led a coup that toppled elitist descendants of the
freed American slaves who established an independent Liberia in
1847.

   An assault rifle seized in the arrest of four
suspected assassins of a Colombian presidential candidate has been
traced by U.S. authorities to an Israeli arms shipment, New York
Newsday reported today.
   The Galil rifle is not believed to be the actual murder weapon
in the Aug. 18 assassination, allegedly by drug traffickers, of
Luis Carlos Galan, the newspaper said.
   Newsday said the weapon was one of several firearms and
explosives discovered by Colombian authorities in two Bogota
safehouses when they arrested the suspected assassins Sept. 21.
   The newspaper quoted Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as saying the rifle had been part
of an Israeli arms shipment purportedly destined for the defense
force of the island of Antigua.
   Published reports have said Galan was believed to have been
killed by a machine pistol but that rifles were fired as a
diversion, Newsday said.
   Israeli Embassy press attache Ruth Yaron in Washington did not
return repeated phone calls from Newsday.
   Israeli officials have repeatedly said the weapons shipment to
Antigua was completely proper and that they had no idea of plans to
divert the guns to other countries.
   Israel has maintained it does not know how the weapons from the
shipment of 500 Galil rifles and Uzi machine pistols ended up in
the hands of the late Colombian drug boss Jose Rodriguez Gacha.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of a Senate narcotics
subcommittee, said the new disclosure was disturbing, and he called
for an investigation.
   The Galan assassination prompted a government crackdown on
Colombia's drug barons and set off a wave of terrorism.
   Colombia has previously claimed that a group of Israeli reserve
officers led by Lt. Col. Yair Klein trained and armed Gacha's
forces. Colombia said Gacha's forces then launched a campaign of
terror against the government.

   President Bush said today he would
look more favorably on western economic aid to the Soviet Union if
Moscow would devote less money to defense spending.
   ``I hope that given the changes in the world they'll be able to
curtail that defense spending some,'' Bush said hours before he was
to leave for a meeting in London with NATO allies.
   ``If they do, I think it will be much easier for the west to
give them certain kinds of economic assistance. It will be a very
good thing,'' the president told reporters.
   Bush was asked about comments by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that Moscow was devoting too much of its national
spending to defense.
   Some European nations have indicated they want to send a western
aid package to help the Soviets' struggling economy. Bush said he
doesn't mind if other nations want to do that, but he is not
interested in contributing until the Soviets show evidence of
economic reform and stop aiding Marxist Cuba.
   While on a six-day vacation at his seaside home, Bush has been
talking by telephone with world leaders and consulting with top
advisers in advance of the Thursday-Friday summit.
   He spoke with the prime ministers of Denmark, Belgium and the
Netherlands on Tuesday before capping his day by viewing early
Fourth of July fireworks from the deck of the Coast Guard training
barque Eagle.
   The president is taking to London a series of proposals dealing
with how to restructure the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
the face of the declining threat from the Soviet Union and its
Eastern European allies.
   In a letter to NATO members, Bush proposed abandoning a
flexible-use strategy for the alliance's nuclear defense in light
of expected Soviet troop withdrawals from the traditional border
front lines of confrontation, national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft said.
   Officials have said Bush is proposing use of nuclear weapons
only as a last resort, contrary to NATO's basic doctrine since 1967
holding that nuclear weapons use would not be ruled out if the
allies were confronted with an invasion by superior conventional
forces.
   Bush did not directly confirm that, but he told reporters, ``The
general approach that we're proposing seems to be getting wide
acceptance.''
   Scowcroft said the proposals are not ``bombshells, but they are
significant because this is a significant time.'' He said the
United States already has gotten favorable reactions from five or
six of the 15 other NATO allies.
   The national security adviser told a news briefing that the
summit will focus on adapting the Western alliance to ``the
changing security environment in Europe,'' including ``the collapse
... of the Warsaw Pact, the changes in Eastern Europe (and) the
turmoil that's going on in the Soviet Union.''
   ``No longer will there be ... armies facing each other directly
across a boundary,'' Scowcroft said. ``It's a very different matter
to attack a few hundred yards across a border than it is to move
forces up several hundred miles into Eastern Europe to be prepared
for an attack.''
   ``One has to look at the issues of forward defense, flexible
response, all the kinds of strategies that NATO pursues now to see
how they might be modified to fit those new circumstances,''
Scowcroft said.
   The administration is anxious to assure the Soviet Union that
NATO, particularly with a unified Germany as a member, will not be
a threat.
   In addition to agreeing to use nuclear weapons only as a last
resort, administration officials say Bush is suggesting that NATO
eventually scrap the 1,470 U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery shells now
based mostly in West Germany, reduce or eliminate an arsenal of
1,560 U.S. nuclear bombs deployed in seven NATO countries and pull
back troops from forward deployment.
   Today, the president ventured out on a rainy morning to get in a
round of golf and show off the self-inflicted wound he got on
Monday while cleaning fish. For curious reporters, the president
peeled back the bandage on his right hand so they could see the
cut. He said he caught 10 fish.
   Bush wraps up his seaside holiday tonight and heads directly to
London. At the end of the week he will fly to Houston for the
economic summit of seven industrialized nations.
   There, he said, trade and agriculture issues will be high on the
agenda.

   A fisherman plans to make steaks with the
710-pound mako shark he caught off Long Island, a marina
spokeswoman said.
   Ray Benza of Yorktown Heights caught the shark Tuesday afternoon
with a rod-and-reel on a charter boat in the Atlantic, 30 miles
south of Montauk. It was the largest of its kind seen in years in
the area.
   Rusty Botta, a Montauk Marine Basin spokeswoman, said biologists
plan to study the female shark before it is eaten.
   The mako is a dangerous shark that looks similar to the great
white shark in the movie ``Jaws,'' said Mike Leech, a spokesman for
the International Game Fish Association in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. A
mako has sharper, more pointed teeth.
   Botta said it took two hours to bring fish to the boat, and four
hours to secure it.
   ``A shark is like a rattler,'' she said. ``You may think it's
dead, but they don't die easily, so all precuations are taken.''
   Leech said that the rod-and-reel record for a mako shark is
1,080 pounds caught off Montauk on Aug. 26, 1979.
   Botta said a great white shark weighing more than 2,000 pounds
was caught off Long Island a few years ago.
   In a Montauk shark contest two weeks ago, the largest mako
caught weighed 155 pounds and the winner made $15,000.

   The city archivist has retired after 27
years but won't leave because she hasn't been told who will replace
her.
   Gladys Hansen's last official day was Saturday, but the
65-year-old plans to stay on by returning her first retirement
check.
   ``I won't retire if I feel this is all in jeopardy,'' she said
Tuesday, gesturing to the collections she has helped amass over the
years. ``Unless I know who is going to take over and what is going
to happen to the collection and the staff, I won't retire.
   City Librarian Kenneth Dowlin, who has been Hansen's boss for
three years, said, ``Gladys seems to be holding us hostage until we
do things her way.''
   City law requires Dowlin, 49, to wait until Hansen's vacation
time and sick leave are expended before advertising for a new
archivist _ about six months from now.
   He said he plans to lovingly care for the collection after
Hansen is off the job, but probably will modernize, automate and
expand the archives.
   ``She has been working for decades on that collection and feels
very possessive about it, but she should be reminded it is not
hers; it belongs to the city,'' he said.

   Burmese, familiar to millions as Queen Elizabeth
II's favorite ceremonial horse, died after suffering a stroke,
Buckingham Palace said Wednesday. The horse was 28.
   The jet black mare, ridden by the monarch in 18 Trooping the
Color ceremonies, died Tuesday at Windsor Palace, 22 miles west of
London, and will be buried in adjacent Windsor Home Park, the
palace said.
   Burmese was given to the queen by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police in 1969, and was featured in a postcard with the queen
riding side-saddle in a scarlet Guards uniform.
   The horse was retired from ceremonial duties in 1986, and the
queen switched to a horse-drawn carriage for Trooping the Color,
the annual military pageant marking her birthday.
   When the mare was retired, trainer Sylvia Stanier said the queen
had a rapport with Burmese and was ``hesitant to start on another
horse.''
   Burmese worked for the police until 1988 when she was put out to
pasture in Windsor Home Park.

   Arthur Barrett was commended for bravery after he disobeyed
orders not to stop his train at the burning station. Thirty-one

   High Court Justice Nicholas Phillips said Barrett had acted with
``great clear-headedness and courage'' by evacuating passengers
during the height of the fire.
   Barrett said he suffered terrible nightmares about the blaze. He
said he was still anxious and obsessed with safety and feared a
possible recurrence of the disaster.

   Of the 100 claims arising from the disaster, Dismore said there

   Businesses that use ozone-destroying
chemicals in this city known for its high-tech industries could
face fines of up to $500 a day and six-month jail terms for their
officers under a new law.
   But many companies in this city of 90,000 people about 40 miles
south of Los Angeles may avoid the restrictions.
   ``I'm expecting a fair number of exemptions, at least in this
first year,'' Michael Brown, the city's environmental coordinator,
said Tuesday.
   City officials hailed the measure as a local solution to a
global problem when the City Council approved it last summer. The
law went into effect Sunday.
   It prohibits companies from using or selling
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and other chemicals that destroy
ozone gas in the stratosphere about 30 to 50 miles above the
Earth's surface.
   Ozone filters out ultraviolet radiation, which can damage the
human immune system, cause skin cancer and cataracts, harm crops
and disrupt sea life.
   Scientists say restoring the ozone layer will require worldwide
controls, and 56 nations last week signed an agreement to ban some
chemicals and set up a $240 million international fund through
which industrialized nations can help developing countries adopt
environmentally safer technology.
   In the United States, some states and localities have been in
the forefront on ozone protection.
   The Connecticut General Assembly last year banned the sale of
freon in small containers to individuals for recharging
refrigerators and car and home air conditioners. But licensed
repair people still can buy them. Similar legislation is pending in
Massachusetts.
   More than a dozen counties and cities, including Irvine, have
enacted ordinances curtailing polystyrene in such uses as fast-food
coffee cups and hamburger boxes. Since industry has modified its
plastics-making process to use a much less ozone-depleting form of
CFCs, the primary benefit of these laws now is to keep landfills
from overflowing.
   Irvine officials have yet to determine which companies are using
CFCs and related chemicals that commonly serve as refrigerants and
industrial solvents and are used in the manufacture of insulation,
foam and plastic food containers.
   ``Our best guess was that 200 to 300 were using CFCs,'' Brown
said. He estimated that as many as 100 will be granted exemptions
because they have no alternative.
   Some, such as Hughes Corp.'s Industrial Electronics Group
division, are legally bound to use solvents specified by contracts
with the government.
   Companies that use solvents to make medical devices are
similarly bound by U.S. Food and Drug Administration rules that
certify a specific manufacturing process.
   Even if companies are granted an exemption, Brown said he has
told them, ```We want you to reduce your use and emissions as much
as you can.'''
   Some businesses, such as Calsonic Climate Control Inc., have
installed equipment that recovers and recycles coolants for
manufacturing automobile air conditioners, Brown said.
   ``They've done a lot to reduce their use,'' Brown said.

   The Greenville (S.C.) News on the savings and loan collapse:
   With great fanfare President Bush last week made public a series
of steps his administration will take to get tougher with criminals
behind the financial collapse of hundreds of savings and loans
institutions.
   Federal prosecutors will get more money, manpower and legal
authority to investigate and prosecute suspected cases of fraud,
the president said, and ``We will not rest until the cheats and
chiselers and charlatans have spent a large chunk of their lives
behind the bars of a federal prison.''
   To a large degree Bush was responding to the politics of the
crisis. Democrats in Congress have become strident in their
criticism of his anti-fraud efforts, and he has traded shots with
them.
   Against this backdrop, the new initiative and the ``we will not
rest'' rhetoric ought to play well with a public that indeed is
suspicious of the overall thrift industry rescue program. Now, most
should be mollified as long as no one expects too much.
   Estimates of the cost of restructuring the thrift industry range
as high as $500 billion, and most of that money is going to come
from taxpayers. ...
   Investigators no doubt need more resources. FBI field offices
last year asked for 425 new agents; they got 202. The U.S. attorney
in Oklahoma has only five lawyers assigned to 40 investigations in
Oklahoma City. Bush's proposal to boost spending on fraud
investigations to $100 million annually is in order. But no one
should expect an early or less costly rescue.

   The Jersey Journal of Jersey City, N.J., on U.S. Supreme Court
ruling against political patronage:
   Whatever its merits as constitutional law, the Supreme Court
decision undercutting the validity of hiring and firing based on
political patronage has the potential to perform a valuable service.
   Patronage has had as damaging an impact in Hudson County as
anywhere in America.
   Hiring rank-and-file workers on the basis of political support
or political activity severs the link between the individual's
success in remaining employed, getting promoted and getting
favorable assignments and his or her performance on the job.
   Too many politicians have a vested interest in creating the jobs
people want, rather than the jobs people need.
   The public, especially in Hudson County, will be well served if
reducing patronage produces more emphasis on doing the job well and
less on serving the political ambitions of politicians and their
partisan supporters.

   The News-Review (Roseburg, Ore.) on math code:
   The fact that a team of mathematicians has succeeded in
splitting a 155-digit number into its three prime factors is hardly
the sort of news that has most people gripping the edges of their
chairs. Nevertheless, in the cryptologist's arcane world of
espionage and secret messages, it is a major triumph. Only a year
ago the feat seemed utterly impossible. But researchers Hendrik
Lenstra of the University of California at Berkeley, and John
Pollard of Reading, England, have come close to confirming Edgar
Allen Poe's famous dictum that human ingenuity cannot concoct a
cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.
   But what practical effect does this mathematical discovery have
on the man in the street? Perhaps more than he realizes. Bankers
use these large code numbers to move funds electronically. Phone
companies use them to ensure privacy. The Defense Department relies
on them for security.
   And governments use them to transmit secret intelligence.
Breaking other nations' codes produces more and better information
than all the world's spies put together.
   ...
   No matter how good we become at solving codes, military and
diplomatic intelligence will always need to be backed up by another
form of intelligence. As the latest team of mathematicians has just
shown, there simply is no replacement for human ingenuity.

   Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on President Bush and taxes:
   That runaway federal deficit is finally going to get the serious
attention it deserves. President Bush is abandoning his ``read my
lips, no new taxes'' pledge that figured so prominently in his
election and has been the capstone of his administration's budget
policies.
   But too much should not be made of Bush's turnaround. It may
sound cynical, but politics is one thing (the ``read my lips'' was
pure politics) and responsible governing is another. It certainly
is in this case.
   Since he made so much of saying never, never, never, it took a
considerable amount of courage for Bush to change his position. ...
   But the deficit is soaring ... All this makes it an urgent
priority to consider tax-raising options, promises or no. Bush's
statement outlined the following package: entitlement and mandatory
program reform, tax-revenue increases, growth incentives, orderly
reductions in defense expenditures and budget-process reform.
   This package of proposals by President Bush will bring the
budget summiteers back to the negotiating table. And if Bush's
change of heart leads to a sensible plan to reduce the federal
deficit, it can hardly be called dumb. It shows that Bush, after
two years of posturing on the issue, is finally taking a
straightforward approach. Neither the Democrats nor the hard-liners
in his own party should try to exploit this politically.

really about brotherhood, global understanding of ethnic
differences and a healthy dose of geography. What these paranoid

   ... That they could convince the Wilton Manors school
administration that they were right and to put pressure on the

breakdown in human relations and a disgusting commentary on

   Milwaukee Sentinel on NASA's Hubble trouble:
   A lot of travelers have known the disappointment of going on
vacation only to find their camera is on the fritz. But just
imagine how the people who put up the Hubble telescope must feel.
   A problem with the light-gathering mirrors has partially
distorted the $1.5 billion eye in the sky, virtually eliminating
its ability to single out dim and distant objects in space.
   Spokesmen for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
say other functions of the Hubble that are operating properly still
justify the scientific mission of the venture.
   But a probe of the problem should focus on how in the world the
craft got off the ground with equipment that was not in tip-top
shape.
   Perhaps an investigation will show that there was no way of
catching the defect. One person connected with the project already
has said that the kind of testing necessary to spot it would have
cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
   But the project was 12 years in the making and experienced
several delays. And it is not enough to say that lack of money was
the reason for the malfunction of a camera that was supposed to
perform 40 percent of the craft's scientific work.
   One report is that one of two precisely ground mirrors was not
made to specification and the suggestion is that the problem was
with the manufacturer. But the public _ whose support for the
project was sustained, in part, by the promise of pictures of
never-before-seen stars _ deserves a thorough explanation.
   The hope, of course, is that some of the lost capability of the
Hubble will be recaptured when a space shuttle team goes up to
service the craft in April 1993, or, given the new problem, maybe
sooner.
   Before they take off, a double check should be made to make sure
they have all the right tools along. The history of the Hubble is
such that nothing can be taken for granted.

   El Paso (Texas) Herald-Post on drunken driving checkpoints:
   The key word in the Bill of Rights' protection against
government harassment of individuals is ``unreasonable.''
   We suspect most Americans agree with the Supreme Court's recent
ruling that police checkpoints are a reasonable means of combating
drunken driving.
   Interestingly, our notion of what is unreasonable is sometimes
irrational.
   No Fourth Amendment challenge to electronic security checks at
airports has reached the high court, yet attacks on planes take
infinitely fewer lives than drunken driving. And airport security
often involves more waiting than sobriety checkpoints along the
road.
   The effectiveness of checkpoints resides largely in deterrence.
The number of people who refrain from driving under the influence
because of a checkpoint cannot be known.
   Organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving have worked
hard to raise the awareness of the routine cost of driving under
the influence. If they keep it up, maybe 23,000 deaths in a year
will come to be seen as the scandal it is and more communities will
crack down.
   Sobriety checkpoints should be among a community's options.

   The Straits Times, Singapore, on developments in Poland:
   If Poland is the first wave of democracy to reach East Europe's
shores, then Mr. Lech Walesa is the triumphant leader riding on its
crest. For bringing about that transformation, history has already
reserved a page for the Solidarity leader. ...
   Mr. Walesa's underdog, anti-establishment and street-fighter
style may have been just the thing to unseat the communists. But to
continue with the same style now may serve his country no good.
Having won the right to dissent, Poland, ironically, now needs a
unity of purpose rather than a babble of voices to face an
uncertain future. ...
   But perhaps it is unrealistic to expect Solidarity to remain in
solidarity for long. The union is, in truth, a protest movement, an
anti-communist platform of diverse parts. With the disappearance of
the common enemy, the true colors of the intellectual, worker,
peasant and other components of the movement are showing through.
The mass defection of the intellectuals from Solidarity's fold is a
sign that Mr. Walesa is increasingly speaking more for a section
within it than the whole movement. ...

Holkeri described the hijacking as a heinous crime and a serious

statement was a necessary political assurance that Finland will ...
act in accordance with international agreements. One such agreement
is between Finland and the Soviet Union on the return of hijackers
to their country of origin. The statement also was undoubtedly
meant as a signal and a warning to potential future hijackers in

   The military governments of the Four Powers in Berlin will soon
be packing their bags. West German capitalists, civil servants and
politicians are poised to take their place. ... Berlin was not
exclusively the odious stronghold of Prussian militarism,
overweening imperial ambition and Nazi fanaticism depicted by
Allied propaganda. On the contrary: it was once no less the
cosmopolitan home of high culture and high finance, of plebian
humor and ethnic diversity. Germany's division cannot be healed
only by the spending of wealth ... Berlin has a vital role to play
as the place in which the severed parts first coalesced. It will
doubtless be the popular choice as capital. But the functions of
government are not indivisible. Bonn could well be allowed to
retain some of its present institutions, even if the Bundestag and
other organs of state were moved to Berlin.

   Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, Sweden on Western assistance to Iran:
   There is no reason why foreign interests should exploit the rift
in the structure of Iranian society caused by the earthquake by
kindling internal confrontation. The risk is then a return to old
ways. The wish by states which are providing assistance to score
quick political points should be sacrificed for the inevitable
process that surely will change Iran in a more sweeping way. The
Iranian leaders are being forced to have what they had feared and
tried to prevent -- cooperation and contacts with other countries.

   A teen-ager whose date to the prom stood
her up got a date in court instead and was awarded $79.50 to cover
her costs.
   ``In the future, I will only ask someone who I can trust,'' Dana
Jurist said Tuesday.
   Miss Jurist, who attends Downingtown Senior High School outside
Philadelphia, said Shawn Norbeck agreed to accompany her to the
junior prom in May after she mentioned she didn't have a date.
   She said she had known Norbeck about five months through their
jobs at a supermarket. He had graduated from high school four years
earlier.
   Miss Jurist said Norbeck's mother told him he had a virus on
prom day, but a friend of his said he actually was going to a rock
concert by the group Rush.
   Norbeck's family said he would have no comment.
   In his June 28 decision, District Justice Harry J. Martini
refused to award Miss Jurist compensation for a $235 dress she
bought because she got to wear it to the senior prom a week later.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims
wound up their rituals at Islam's holiest sites Wednesday while the
Moslem world mourned the deaths of 1,426 people in the worst
pilgrimage tragedy in modern history.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said the tragedy proved the
Saudi royal family is incompetent to administer Islam's holiest
shrines.
   Rafsanjani's harsh remarks ended hopes that relations might
improve after the generous relief supplies Saudi Arabia sent to
Iranian earthquake victims.
   Most pilgrims were leaving the plains of Mina by sunset
Wednesday and heading for Mecca to make a farewell circle of the
Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine to which Moslems turn five times in
daily prayer.
   Part of the day's rituals also included the ``stoning of the
devil'' for a third time at Gamarat Aqabah, the site where the
pilgrims were headed when the tragic stampede occurred Monday.
   Saudi authorities were setting up a large area at the holy sites
for graves for those victims whose families wanted them to be
buried at Mecca.
   In the Islamic faith, to die and be buried in Mecca is a
blessing.
   Saudi officials said the tragedy in the Mo'essem tunnel began
when a railing on a pedestrian bridge over the tunnel bent, sending
seven pilgrims tumbling to their deaths on top of people coming out
of the tunnel.
   The bodies crashing into the throng touched off panic. Only
those at the entrance to the tunnel knew what had happened.
   Behind them, pilgrims continued to move inside. The
1,000-capacity tunnel filled with an estimated 50,000 pushing,
shoving pilgrims.
   Many died in the frantic stampede. Others died when the
ventilation system in the 600-yard-long, 35-foot-wide tunnel
stopped, inexplicably.
   The accident, which happened on the first day of the Eid al-Adha
or Feast of Sacrifice, was described by King Fahd as ``the will of
God.''
   Hospital sources in Jiddah said the victims included Arabs,
Indonesians, Malaysians, Turks, Pakistanis and Indians as well as
Saudis.
   ``It was fate,'' Fahd said. ``Had they not died there, they
would have died elsewhere and at the same predestined moment.''
   ``Throughout the world accidents suddenly happen _ planes crash,
buildings collapse, trains collide,'' he said.
   He referred to the recent earthquake in Iran, where at least
40,000 died. ``The earthquake in the Moslem state of Iran: Could
anyone stop that? Can anyone stop death? It is God's will above
all.''
   Fahd's comments on state-run television came as Saudi Arabia,
which has spent billions of dollars to maintain and upgrade the
holy sites, faced criticism from the Islamic world _ most of all
from its arch-rivals in Iran.
   Rafsanjani, in an interview with the official Islamic Republic
News Agency and Tehran Radio, said it was ``unacceptable'' to liken
the events in Mecca to the earthquake that struck Iran last month.
   ``Those officials responsible for administering the holy
sanctuaries and the Saudi rulers should be answerable to the
Islamic world,'' he said. ``From such incidents it is clear that
the level of the security of the pilgrims in Saudi Arabia should be
increased.''
   Three Iranian newspapers also blamed the Saudi ruling family.
   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April 1988, after
accusing the Iranian leadership of terrorism and subversion.
   Islamic leaders, from those in neighboring Persian Gulf
countries to leading Moslem nations such as Pakistan, were quickly
closing ranks with the Saudi monarch, sending messages of
condolence saying the tragedy was an act of God.
   The tunnel was built as part of a $15-billion development
project launched by the government at the holy sites two years ago.
With these renovation schemes, Saudi Arabia secured Moslem world
backing in 1988 to limit the numbers of pilgrims to 1,000 per
million in each country because of the ongoing work.
   The Iranians, who considered the limit directed against them,
have boycotted the annual pilgrimage season for the three years
since.
   Iranian activists or pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems have spread
terrorism at the annual hajj since 1986, when security men found
large quantities of explosives during the pilgrimage.
   The following year, Saudi riot police clashed with pilgrims, who
defied a government ban on political rallies during the religious
event. More than 400 people, mostly Iranians, were killed.
   Last year, one pilgrim was killed and 16 were wounded in two
bombs explosions. Sixteen people, tried and convicted of the
attacks, were beheaded by the Saudi government.

   Walls of a hydroelectric powerhouse are
being knocked out this week so a turn-of-the century turbine and
generator can be removed for display at the Henry Ford Museum.
   It will join a ``Made in America'' exhibit opening in fall 1992
at the museum in Dearborn, Mich.
   Curator John Bowditch said an advertisement for the machinery in
this spring's newsletter of the Society for Industrial Archaeology
caught his eye. Earlier this week, he was in Spokane to examine the
turbine and generator.
   ``I am very happy to be able the save them because equipment of
this nature almost inevitably ends up in a scrap heap,'' Bowditch
said.
   Washington Water Power Co. is donating the machines to the
museum as a result of a $26 million upgrade.
   The generator was installed in 1903 below the city's most
prominent waterfall on the Spokane River.

<HEAD>Korean Battle Army's Example of How Not to Fight A War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's Task Force Smith peered through a
steady rainfall on the morning of July 5, 1950, and saw 33 oncoming
Soviet-made tanks and thousands of North Korean infantrymen.
   The unit had just six artillery shells powerful enough to
penetrate heavy tank armor. Their bloody, seven-hour rout is held
up by the Army 40 years later as an example of how not to fight a
war.
   Task Force Smith's defeat is an object lesson for the 1990s,
declares Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army chief of staff. He says the
army of 1950 was fractured by the rapid demobilization and meager
budgets that followed the World War II.
   Vuono says he fears that could repeat itself as the Cold War
recedes and political and budget pressures build to rapidly cut
military spending.
   The survivors of the ill-equipped Task Force Smith units are
convening for a reunion in nearby Alexandria, Va., Thursday, proud
of their fight, but resentful of the government-created obstacles
they faced.
   ``The lesson from Task Force Smith is that there is a need for a
trained and ready army in times of peace, especially when the army
is small,'' Gen. Vuono said.
   Named for its commander, Lt.Col. Charles Bradford Smith, Task
Force Smith was hastily stitched together from infantry and
artillery units after North Korea struck across the 38th parallel
on June 25.
   On the morning of July 5, with North Korean troops already in
the South Korean capital of Seoul, Task Force Smith was dug in on a
ridge commanding a highway and railway line about 22 miles south of
Seoul.
   The first U.S. combat unit to go into action in Korea, Task
Force Smith had problems: Weapons that didn't work, inoperable
radios, no air support, no resupply and no maps to lead troops to
safety once the situation fell apart.
   ``We found out we didn't have any weapons that could penetrate
the armor on the tanks,'' says William Wyrick, 65, a retired Army
colonel who was then a young first lieutenant leading a platoon.
   The unit's high-explosive, antitank or HEAT rounds, represented
one third of the armor piercing ammunition available in depots in
Japan.
   Those six rounds ``killed two tanks,'' Wyrick said, in an
telephone interview from his home in Columbia, S.C.
   But less powerful artillery shells simply bounced off the armor
or didn't explode at all.
   ``All we could do was scratch the tanks and annoy the gunners,''
said Carl Bernard, another retired Army colonel who was a platoon
leader with Task Force Smith.
   ``If we had been able to stop the tanks, we would have been in a
totally different world,'' Bernard said.
   ``The vast majority of the weapons we carried into that fight
had been declared combat unserviceable,'' Wyrick said. ``Our
vehicles were worn out. Our radios didn't work because the
batteries were corroded.''
   The North Korean tanks sliced through Task Force Smith during
the first hour of fighting and continued their drive south.
   Elements of the North Korean infantry, crowded into a column of
trucks that some accounts say formed a six-mile-long line, attacked
the U.S. positions.
   They were twice driven back, Wyrick said.
   ``But by 2:30 in the afternoon we were running out of
ammunition,'' he said. ``They were enveloping our flank and Col.
Smith gave the order to withdraw.''
   Bernard never got the word and learned of the move only after a
runner found the command post abandoned.
   ``The withdrawal immediately became ragged and chaotic,'' says
author T.R. Fehrenbach in his 1989 account of the Korean War,
``This Kind of War, A Study in Unpreparedness.''
   ``At close range, automatic weapons chewed the retreating
Americans, breaking them up into small, disorganized units,''
Fehrenbach wrote. ``They left their dead where they lay, and
abandoned the 30 or so wounded who were too hurt to walk.''
   Of the more than 400 men who went into action with Task Force
Smith, some 150 did not return.
   ``We had no medical evacuation, no resupply of food or
ammunition,'' Wyrick said. ``It was especially difficult because no
one had a map. The officers had only a general idea of where we
were.''
   The two former lieutenants say their men lacked little in the
way of fighting spirit but simply didn't have the resources to do
the job.
   ``I don't object to the way we fought; I object to the result,''
Bernard said. ``We didn't get anything like what we should have
gotten.''

<HEAD>Panama Orders Cuba to Reduce Embassy Staff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government that was installed in
Panama during the U.S. invasion today accused Cuba of ``hostile
conduct'' and gave the Cuban Embassy 10 days to reduce its staff to
four members.
   A Foreign Ministry communique said all personnel other than the
charge d'affaires, the commercial and economic attaches and the
consul must leave the country. The statement did not give the
current size of the embassy staff.
   The embassy has been a strong critic of President Guillermo
Endara since he was installed during the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that
deposed Manuel Antonio Noriega and brought him to the United States
to face federal drug charges.
   Noriega's wife and daughters and some other Noriega associates
took refuge at the embassy after the invasion. Some of them later
traveled to Cuba, but former Noriega legislator Luis Gomez remains
in the embassy.
   The communique mentioned two instances in which the Cuban
government questioned the legitimacy of the Panamanian government
or its leaders. The statement also referred to a series of
unspecified incidents in which the Cuban government exhibited
``hostile conduct'' toward the Panamanian government.

   The United States is quietly improving
relations with Laos as that nation's communist government shifts
from state control of the economy and works to attract foreign
private investment, officials say.
   The two nations are expanding joint efforts to combat drug
smuggling and discussing the possibility of sending Peace Corps
volunteers to the Southeast Asian nation, officials say.
   Laos, along with Vietnam and Cambodia, came under communist rule
in 1975. It was the only one of the three countries with which the
U.S. maintained diplomatic ties and with which there appears to be
tangible progress toward friendly relations.
   Two decades ago, U.S. warplanes bombed Laos for years in a
failed effort to wipe out a communist insurgency. But the rebels
seized power within weeks after communist triumphs in Vietnam and
Cambodia.
   Talks on sending Peace Corps volunteers are still in the
preliminary stage, U.S. officials say, with the focus on the type
of experts the agency could send to Laos. The Peace Corps has never
sent volunteers to a communist country although discussions had
been held with China before Sino-American relations soured last
year.
   Last fall, the United States and Laos agreed on a development
aid project, the first anywhere in Indochina in 15 years. The $8.7
million effort is aimed at persuading farmers in northeast Laos to
cultivate crops other than opium.
   Linked to that project was an agreement signed last January in
which Laos promised a ``maximum effort'' to halt the cultivation
and trafficking of opium.
   Laos also has been more cooperative in helping the U.S.
government obtain an accounting for American servicemen killed
there during the Vietnam war.
   The collaboration has included inspections in remote areas by
teams of Laotians and Americans and visits to sites where U.S. war
planes crashed.
   In addition, Laos has lifted restrictions on travel by U.S.
diplomats in its capital of Vientiane and on the number of
Americans authorized to serve there.
   The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since the
communist victory, but discussions on a possible exchange have
begun, U.S. officials said.
   ``The whole dialogue has improved,'' said one U.S. official, who
insisted that he not be identified.
   The conciliation effort has been made easier by a substantial
reduction in the number of Vietnamese troops stationed in Laos,
which had long been seen as the junior partner in its alliance with
Vietnam.
   U.S. officials estimate there were once as many as 40,000 to
50,000 Vietnamese troops in Laos. Only a handful, at most, remain,
they say.
   Beyond that, Laos has set free virtually all of the several
thousand political prisoners confined to labor camps after the
communist victory, the officials said.
   Perhaps the most significant change relates to Laos's effort to
revitalize its moribund economy, the officials said.
   Laos has been selling off state enterprises and moving toward a
private economy with a heavy reliance on foreign investment.
   The shifts began after Laos appeared to be falling increasingly
behind the dynamic economies elsewhere in the region, including
neighboring Thailand.

   Former Communist officials of Lithuania who were
ousted during the republic's two-year quest for independence have
wound up as Soviet diplomats in Africa and Mongolia, a news agency
reported Wednesday.
   Former Lithuanian Prime Minister Vitotas Sokolauskas, who was
defeated in the republic's first multicandidate elections for the
Soviet parliament last year, is being trained to be a counselor in
the Soviet embassy to Mozambique, said the independent news agency
Postfactum.
   The ambassador there is former Lithuanian Communist Party second
secretary Nikolai Dibenko, it said.
   Victor Baltrunas, former ideology chief of the Lithuanian
Communist Party, is awaiting appointment as the ambassador to Ivory
Coast, while former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Victor
Mikuchyauskas is to become ambassador to Sierra Leone, the agency
said.
   Former party ideology official Cheslovas Slizhyus will represent
the Soviet Union in Mongolia.
   Postfactum added that Kazimieras Plekhavicius, the former
Minister of Services for the republic, has gone into the business
of building horse-drawn carriages.

   A man was convicted of first-degree
murder and of gang membership in what prosecutors said was the
first Los Angeles County conviction under a 2-year-old state law.
   The anti-gang-membership law can add three years to a prison
sentence stemming from a separate felony conviction.
   Jurors on Tuesday convicted 23-year-old Manuel Madrigal in the
slaying of Jimmie Torrez, 16. Sentencing was scheduled for July 23.
   Prosecutors said only Orange and Riverside counties had won
convictions under the law.
   Past attempts to gain such convictions in Los Angeles County
have failed, the District Attorney's office said.
   Because first-degree murder generally carries a life sentence,
the gang law should not affect Madrigal's prison term, said Deputy
District Attorney Ed Nison.
   But the conviction ``gives a strong message that if you're
associated with a gang member, you're going to have a stiffer
penalty,'' Nison said.
   Madrigal's attorney, Mel Brown, said he would appeal the
conviction. He also insisted his client was not a gang member.

<TEXT>
   As NATO leaders ponder the alliance's future,
President Bush is cast somewhere between Margaret Thatcher's
cautious approach and Helmut Kohl's pursuit of conciliation with
Moscow.
   The arrangement gives Bush tremendous power to influence the
outcome of the two-day strategic review in London. As it is, U.S.
presidents, by virtue of America's historic might, tend to dominate
such sessions anyhow.
   Even before the 16 NATO nations assembled in London word leaked
out that Bush was willing to consider scrapping 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells and 1,560 U.S. tactical nuclear
bombs in light of a diminished Soviet threat and a disintegrating
Warsaw Pact.
   Also, the strategic doctrine that has guided NATO's policies for
over four decades was due for an overhaul. Because a blitzkrieg by
the Red Army is less likely than ever, the allies are ready to make
the use of nuclear weapons an option of last resort. This flips the
existing first-use theory upside down to reflect new military
realities in Europe.
   And yet, even though Bush sent letters to the other leaders
before the summit, outlining his proposals, there was a lot of room
left for debate and for decision in London.
   ``This is not a pre-cooked summit meeting,'' a U.S. official
said. ``That wouldn't bring about the best results.''
   When the debate breaks out _ circumspectly behind closed doors _
it is quite likely that Mrs. Thatcher, Britain's prime minister,
will make the argument for keeping NATO's guard up. It is equally
likely that Kohl, the chancellor of West Germany, will emphasize
that the East-West relationship must be sharply changed to reflect
the ending of the Cold War.
   ``Communism has crumbled. It has lost all credibility, even
among nominal believers,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the NATO foreign
ministers at a pre-summit session June 7 in Turnberry, Scotland.
   And yet, she said, Europe's future is bound to be turbulent and
uncertain.
   ``We must keep our capacity effectively to deter and to defend
ourselves,'' she said. ``You don't cancel your home insurance
policy just because there have been fewer burglaries in your street
in the last 12 months.''
   Of the other NATO leaders, President Francois Mitterrand of
France is perhaps most inclined to support Mrs. Thatcher's cautious
approach.
   On the other end of the spectrum is Kohl, backed by a foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who has taken the lead in trying
to allay Soviet and Polish concerns about the impending West German
absorption of East Germany.
   These assurances include a pledge not to develop German nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, permitting the Red Army to remain
for a transitional period on what is now East German territory and
keeping NATO forces out of that region in the meantime.
   The Bush administration has endorsed this approach, but steered
clear _ so far _ of West Germany's economic inducements to Moscow,
including an aid package that might be put together with other West
European governments.
   Bush did say Wednesday, however, he would look more favorably
upon western economic aid to Moscow if the Kremlin slashed spending
on defense.
   ``I hope that given the changes in the world they'll be able to
curtail that defense spending some,'' he told reporters in
Kennebunkport, Maine, his summer vacation retreat, just hours
before leaving for London.
   Gesncher, speaking at a May 27 University of Maryland-European
branch commencement, proclaimed that a united Germany will remain
in NATO.
   However, he also said that ``the development of a
stability-oriented partnership with the Soviet Union and other
European countries is the right perspective for the Atlantic
Alliance.''
   Genscher is for broadening the role of the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which deals with
military security, economic cooperation and human rights.
   ``The CSCE process must be intensified and given permanent
institutional foundations,'' he said.
   A new relationship between NATO and the Warsaw Pact must be
developed, ``to open up new possibilities for the development of
relations with the Soviet Union,'' Genscher said.
   On the nuclear issue, meanwhile, Kohl and Genscher tend to
reflect the anxieties of a German populace faced with the largest
concentration of nuclear weapons in the world.
   This has contributed to West Germany's conciliatory approach
perhaps as much as Bonn's eagerness for unification.
   All these conflicting views and national pressures will be close
to the surface at the NATO summit as the alliance begins to change
its focus from a military to a political forum.
   On the one side there is Mrs. Thatcher, adamant that NATO's
future role is to remain a defense alliance bolstered with nuclear
weapons and U.S. troops.
   To reinforce this stand, Britain is replacing its aging nuclear
weapons with U.S. Trident missiles.
   ``Sufficient forces and weapons keep us secure, not fine
words,'' she said in Turnberry.
   Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, agrees that U.S. troops should
remain in West Germany. But his government was the principal force
within NATO for delaying the deployment of new U.S. short-range
nuclear missiles. And in May, Bush scrapped the program for
installing new Lances.
   Which side will Bush come down on in London?
   Administration officials prefer casting the question differently.
   ``The United States,'' an official said, ``is trying to provide
a pole of consensus around which the alliance can rally.''

   Here is a look at events in Lithuania since the
republic's declaration of independence from Moscow:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   March 11 _ The Lithuanian legislature elects the first
non-Communist president of a Soviet republic, Vytautas Landsbergis,
changes the republic's name and declares independence from Moscow.
   March 13 _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declares
Lithuania's move illegal.
   
   March 15 _ Gorbachev, elected the Soviet Union's first executive
president, is given authority by the Soviet congress to deal with
the dispute with Lithuania.
   
   March 16 _ Gorbachev gives Lithuania three days to begin
returning to the Soviet fold. Lithuania rejects his authority.
   March 21 _ Gorbachev gives Lithuanians seven days to turn in
firearms.
   March 22 _ Soviet armor rumbles through Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital, in a show of force.
   April 18 _ Gorbachev stops shipments of all oil, most natural
gas and other raw materials to Lithuania to pressure the republic

<HEAD>Nationalist Party And Opposition Agree on Presidential Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government and opposition defused a
constitutional crisis Wednesday and agreed on democratic reforms,
including a popular vote for president to end four decades of
one-party rule.
   An opposition leader called the decision a ``peaceful
revolution.''
   A historic weeklong National Affairs Conference that concluded
Wednesday agreed to give more power to native Taiwanese, dominated
by the ruling Nationalist Party that retreated to this island from
mainland China in 1949.
   President Lee Teng-hui called the meeting after student protests
in March demanded the scrapping of the system that has preserved
the Nationalists' lock on power.
   Opposition politicians had warned there would be violent
demonstrations if no reforms were implemented.
   Lee told the delegates in a closing speech that he would support
the recommendations by the 140 delegates, including 80 members of
the ruling party and 16 representatives from the Democratic
Progressive Party. Independent academics and politicians accounted
for the remaining seats.
   ``This is the time to act,'' Lee said.
   Many delegates proposed popular presidential elections when
Lee's term ends in 1996, but some supported an earlier vote.
   ``We have just had a peaceful revolution to gain democracy,''
said Chang Chung-hung, secretary-general of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party. ``We can now organize a new
government governed by law rather than by a few people.''
   Convention delegates also supported direct election of the
mayors of Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Currently, those mayors are appointed by the Nationalist government.
   And delegates ratified an earlier Nationalist proposal to retire
by 1991 all 800 elderly members of the lawmaking Legislative Yuan
and electoral college from mainland China.
   A task force of representatives from the major parties will
settle remaining differences on the democratic reforms, officials
said on condition of anonymity.
   One unresolved issue is whether the electoral college should be
abolished, as the opposition proposes, or transformed into a
symbolic institution that would reflect the popular vote but still
reserve seats for deputies purportedly representing mainland China.
   No dramatic progress was made, however, in discussions on
relations with the rival Communist government in Beijing. The
conference urged more trade and cultural exchanges but cautioned
against talks on reunification before Beijing agrees to end its
policy of isolating Taipei diplomatically.
   The debate focused on what to do with the 1947 constitution,
enacted in China by the Nationalist government two years before it
lost a civil war to the Communists and retreated to the offshore
island, now home to 20 million people.
   The Nationalists have since used the constitution as the legal
basis for their political power.
   Claiming to still be the legitimate government of all China, the
Nationalists have not allowed native Taiwanese to vote for a
majority of seats in the Legislature and electoral college.
Instead, the party froze in lawmakers elected on the Chinese
mainland more than four decades ago.
   The Nationalists have acknowledged the need for change as the
aging lawmakers from the mainland die off and the increasingly
affluent native Taiwanese _ 85 percent of the island population _
demand more political power.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed Nelson
Mandela today, just three years after she denounced his African
National Congress as a terrorist organization and said she would
have nothing to do with it.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Mandela called their first meeting a success
despite disagreement on sanctions and the ANC's commitment to armed
struggle against the white minority government in South Africa.
   ``They had a very good exchange. They agreed to keep in touch,''
said a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The objective of establishing a personal relationship
and rapport was fully achieved.''
   Mandela described Mrs. Thatcher as ``warm and gentle'' and told
a news conference he was ``very encouraged'' by their three-hour
meeting.
   ``There were a number of points on which we did not see eye to
eye completely like the question of sanctions, the use of violence
as a method of political action,'' he said.
   ``Our views on economic questions were not altogether identical
but we made progress and I went away with the distinct impression
that the prime minister was willing to exchange views with us on
the problems that are confronting us in South Africa,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher greeted Mandela as he arrived in drizzling rain at
her 10 Downing Street residence just before noon.
   Some 300 anti-apartheid demonstrators who back sanctions
demonstrated at the end of Downing Street and chanted as Mandela's
limousine went through the gates blocking off the street.
   Earlier today, Mandela urged British businessman to support
sanctions for up to two years during final negotiations to end
apartheid.
   Mrs. Thatcher and British business oppose sanctions and want
those imposed by the European Community relaxed as a reward for
South African President F.W. de Klerk's reform program.
   Mandela told more than 250 senior British business executives
that both the South African government and the ANC want an end to
sanctions and there is now ``an element of urgency'' on both sides
to negotiate quickly so they can be lifted.
   ``We are aware of the damage which has been done to our economy
by sanctions and we do not want our economy to be reduced to ashes
by the maintenance of sanctions,'' he said.
   ``All that we are saying to the international community is that
give us a few months, if not a year or two to resolve this question
amongst ourselves,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela stressed that economic progress is crucial to the
success of any political settlement because of the disparity in
living standards of blacks and whites.
   ``It will be critical that the economy grows rapidly and at
rates that supercede population growth. This cannot happen without
large inflows of foreign capital, including British capital,'' he
said.
   British investment forms 50 percent of the total foreign
investment in South Africa and two-way trade in 1989 was worth just
over $3.2 billion.

<DATELINE>KAWACHI, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori
knelt before his family's Buddhist altar Wednesday during a
pilgrimage to his ancestral home that has brought promises of aid
for his debt-ridden country.
   Residents of the small seaside town of Kawachi waited for hours
under blazing sun to greet Fujimori. It was his first visit in 18
years to the home his parents left for Peru in 1934.
   In addition to his red-carpet welcome, Fujimori received
promises of private aid from the region and pledges of medical and
technical assistance from the local government.
   They were Fujimori's first firm promises of aid since his
arrival in Japan on Sunday.
   Fujimori, an agronomist, was a political unknown before he
defeated celebrated novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru's June 10
presidential runoff.
   He played up his Japanese heritage during the campaign, even
posing dressed as a samurai warrior for news photographers.
   ``It was a very emotional visit for me,'' Fujimori said. ``I was
surprised at the reaction. I felt the people received me with the
same simple and frank hospitality as the Peruvians.''
   Fujimori, the first person of Japanese descent to win such a
leadership outside Japan, appears to have charmed the Japanese with
his frank admiration for this nation's culture and economic power.
   Schoolgirls treated Fujimori as if he were a movie star. Banners
proclaiming ``Bienvenido Presidente,'' greeted the Peruvian in this
hilly, tangerine-growing town on the southern island of Kyushu.
   Elderly residents, who remember the days when poverty drove
many, including the Fujimoris, from the village, said they were
thrilled. Kawachi demonstrated its enthusiasm by awarding Fujimori
the town's first honorary citizenship.
   Fujimori shook hands with people in the crowd, paid his respects
to his ancestors at the household altar and posed for photos with
relatives still living in the town of 8,500 people.
   Fujimori's talks earlier in the week with top Japanese leaders
failed to draw any concrete promises of aid for his nation's ailing
economy.
   But the governor of Kumamoto, the state where Kawachi is
located, said local groups were considering the best way to provide
private aid to Peru.
   ``Mr. Fujimori says there is a shortage of everything, from
medicine to soccer balls,'' said Gov. Morihiro Hosokawa. ``We want
to help meet those needs.''
   Hosokawa also said his government planned to invite medical and
technical trainees from Peru to local research institutes.
   Japanese officials have denied Peru would receive special
treatment because of Fujimori's family ties. Fujimori, who assumes
office July 28, has sought to emphasize those ties throughout his
visit.
   ``I am proud to have my roots in both countries,'' he said. ``I
plan to use the strong blood of the people of this area, who left
60 to 70 years ago, for the sake of my country.''
   Fujimori was to leave Japan Thursday after a five-day visit. His
12-day foreign tour began in Washington and will also take him to
South Korea.
   He told reporters he planned emergency economic measures to cope
with Peru's 2,000 percent annual inflation and isolation from the
international financial community.
   Peru, considered virtually bankrupt, has not made payments on
its $22 billion foreign debt since the mid-1980s and is ineligible
for money from international lending institutions.
   Fujimori is seeking medium- and long-term loans from Japan and a
$1.8 billion bridge loan from the International Mometary Fund to
help stabilize the economy.
   He said he planned a new currency to replace the severely
devalued indica, utility price increases and a temporary, hefty tax
on wealth.
   ``The economy of Peru needs order, it needs to recover
equilibrium in its prices,'' he said.
   Japanese leaders have said Japan might aid Peru if Fujimori
works with the IMF and other multilateral organizations to address
its economic problems.
   Peru owes Japan about $1 billion in government and private
credits.

   Former President Carter was awarded the
$100,000 Philadelphia Liberty Medal in a sun-baked Fourth of July
ceremony at Independence Hall.
   He pledged to use the prize money for peace and humanitarian
activities everywhere in the world.
   ``This award is given not to me but for the work we are doing at
the Carter Center in Georgia,'' he told a crowd of thousands
gathered in the mall between two historic shrines _ the hall where
the Declaration of Independence was written and the Liberty Bell
Pavilion.
   The ceremony kicked off the city's ``Freedom Festival,'' to
celebrate the nation's 214th birthday.
   The first medal, which honors the pursuit of liberty and freedom
from oppression and ignorance, went to Poland's Lech Walesa last
year.
   A group called ``We The People'' set up the medal and obtained
funding for the first three years from the Bell Atlantic Co. It
plans to raise money to fund the awards beyond next year.
   Carter said in a statement that even as Americans celebrate the
holiday ``we should remember that liberty is a privilege that many
in the world don't enjoy.''
   The Atlanta-based Carter Center focuses its work on promoting
democracy, preserving human rights, and fighting hunger.
   Carter came to Philadelphia on Tuesday, where he was the guest
of honor at a gala pageant and dinner.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode called Carter ``an absolute inspiration to
all who love freedom and love people,'' and hoped he would inspire
leaders in urban communities, including Philadelphia, to rescue
children from drugs and poverty.
   After accepting the medal, Carter was to join Goode in cutting
``America's Birthday Cake,'' which is big enough to serve 25,000
people.
   The cake was to be sliced up and then served, with ice cream, to
the crowd assembled on a plaza across the street from the Liberty
Bell.

   A rancher accused of running a drug
smuggling empire is back in the U.S. after 20 years as a fugitive,
the last three fighting extradition.
   Daniel James Fowlie faces a U.S. District Court hearing July 10
on 26 counts of narcotics trafficking and illegal-currency
transactions.
   If convicted, Fowlie could be sentenced to life in prison.
   An indictment alleges Fowlie, 56, supervised shipments of nearly
27 tons of marijuana from 1982 to 1986 and transferred more than $1
million in cash abroad without reporting it to the government.
   Fowlie's operation bought marijuana in Mexico and smuggled it to
Orange County in quantities between 50 pounds to 30,000 pounds,
according to the indictment.
   He was extradited from Mexico and arrived at John Wayne Airport
on Monday, flanked by U.S. agents who escorted him from a La Paz
jail where he had been imprisoned for three years on a U.S.
government warrant.
   Fowlie had fought extradition, saying it would violate the
Mexican Constitution, but a court in Mazatlan on June 22 upheld the
transfer.
   Authorities allege that Fowlie engineered a massive
marijuana-and cocaine-smuggling ring from Rancho del Rio, his
213-acre ranch near San Juan Capistrano.
   Six of his alleged helpers _ including sons Daniel and Gus _
have been convicted.
   In 1985, county sheriff's investigators seized his ranch and
last summer, President Bush used the property as a backdrop for a
nationally televised address on drug abuse.
   In an interview earlier this year, Fowlie denied the charges,
saying he was railroaded by former associates-turned-government
snitches.
   Various law enforcement agencies tracked Fowlie for more than 20
years, traveling to Europe and Central America in pursuit of him.
In the late 1960s, he was linked to drug guru Timothy Leary and a
smuggling ring known as the Brotherhood of Love.
   Fowlie later started an import-export business in Laguna Beach
and lived an extravagant lifestyle, purchasing airplanes, exotic
cars and estates in Orange County, Baja California and Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Jurors: `Racial' Attack Was Case of Mistaken Identity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A black youth who was killed in an attack by a
white gang in Bensonhurst was a victim of mistaken identity, not
racial bias, according to jurors who cleared one mob member of
intentional murder and discrimination.
   The jury Tuesday failed to resolve a second murder charge
against John Vento, 21, in what has been routinely described as the
racially motivated attack on Yusuf Hawkins.
   Jurors interviewed after the verdict said prosecutors and
journalists had overemphasized the role of race in the slaying,
which occurred last August in a predominantly white, lower middle
class section of Brooklyn and inflamed racial tensions throughout
the city.
   ``We all felt this was really more about mistaken identity,''
said juror Lee Levin. If Hawkins and three other blacks ``had gone
to the same section of Bensonhurst on any other night ... these
people would not have been involved in an incident,'' she added.
   ``Race was used for identification only,'' agreed juror Judith
Schwartz, a teacher. ``If they had heard a bunch of Norwegians were
coming to the neighborhood looking for trouble, they would have
acted the same way.''
   ``If the only reason they attacked (Hawkins) was because he was
black _ that would have been discrimination,'' she said.
   According to testimony at the trials of Vento and two other
young men, the whites believed that a group of blacks and Hispanics
was coming to start a fight over a woman who had been involved with
one of the whites.
   Instead, the whites set upon the 16-year-old Hawkins when he
came to the Brooklyn neighborhood to look at a used car that was
for sale.
   The jury's four black members agreed that race did not motivate
Vento and most of his companions. ``All they had to go on was some
blacks and Puerto Ricans were coming to the neighborhood,'' said
one, Kenneth Spears, a transit worker.
   Spears said some members of the mob may have been racists, but
added, ``We can't get into their minds, so we don't know.''
   Vento's lawyer, Gerald DiChiara, said that prosecutors created a
racial issue for political purposes. DiChiara seemed to have
defused the racial issue during the trial by calling as witnesses
four black men who knew Vento and said he was not a bigot.
   Ms. Schwartz said the news media also tried to make the incident
seem purely racial in origin. ``I went in thinking he was probably
guilty,'' she said. ``But then I heard the evidence and the law.''
   She said she was so convinced of Vento's innocence that she
would contribute $500 to a defense fund for his September retrial
on charges of riot and murder with depraved indifference.
   Vento, who allegedly helped organize the gang, was convicted of
two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of menacing.
   Jurors said the votes on the unresolved charges were 10-2 for
acquittal on murder by depraved indifference and 8-4 for conviction
on riot.
   On the murder by depraved indifference count, ``There was
agreement that he organized people. There was agreement that he was
there,'' said Levin, one of the two holdouts for a murder
conviction.
   ``All the physical stuff was there, but there wasn't agreement
on whether he was mentally culpable.''
   Juror Irwin Ziegler said the deliberations were ``not very nice.
... It was very tense, very emotional, a lot of yelling and
screaming.''
   Vento faces one and one-third to four years in prison on the
unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing count.
Sentencing is Aug. 14.
   He was the third member of the mob to go on trial; Keith
Mondello and Joseph Fama both were convicted of discrimination.
Fama, who allegedly fired the shot that killed Hawkins, was
convicted of murder, but Mondello was acquitted of the most serious
charges. Five other youths still face trial.

<HEAD>San Francisco Photographer Latest Star in Art vs. Censorship
Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A photographer whose black-and-white prints
have been shown internationally became an advocate in the debate
over arts censorship after much of his life's work was seized in an
obscenity investigation.
   Jock Sturges hasn't been arrested or charged, but the San
Francisco-based photographer has been the subject of a federal
grand jury investigation for nine weeks.
   The 43-year-old Sturges said he finds himself ``cast in a role
that I'm unprepared for,'' in being accused of child pornography.
   About half of his photographs are of nude men and women and
their children. Sturges says the subjects are ``naturists'' who
provide written permission for the photos to be published or
displayed.
   Federal agents confiscated all types of works by Sturges, who
also photographs fashion models and classical dancers. His most
lucrative local account, the Marin Ballet, canceled his contract
after the investigation began.
   ``I'm under assault,'' Sturges told several hundred people who
gathered Monday night in a San Francisco theater to hear his story.
``But I'm getting lots of support from the arts community.
   ``It's time to say enough is enough. ... I was shocked at first,
depressed, when my life's work was carried away. Now I'm beginning
to get angry.''
   Sturges shared a podium with Dennis Barrie, a Cincinnati gallery
director under indictment for exhibiting explicit photographs by
the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``This is not an aberration, what happened in Cincinnati,''
Barrie told the audience, warning that unless he wins his case
pro-censorship forces will grow bolder.
   ``If we lose all arts museums are vulnerable.''
   Sturges reminded Barrie that ``this is not Cincinnati.'' Indeed,
Mayor Art Agnos declared Monday Dennis Barrie Day in San Francisco.
A resolution protesting the case against Sturges was approved
Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors' City Services Committee.
   ``There is a dangerous state of hysteria and repression over
freedom of expression of artists in the United States,'' said the
resolution, which goes before the full board next week.
   Sturges says some of his artworks have been ruined since police
and FBI raids on his apartment and the shop of his film processor,
Joseph Semien, who was arrested for investigation of possessing
child pornography.
   The FBI and the San Francisco district attorney's office have
refused to comment on the cases. FBI spokesman Duke Diedrich would
only say, ``We're very careful when we handle evidence.''
   In a similar investigation, federal prosecutors in Portland,
Maine, have gone to court to get permission to destroy a photograph
of a nude father and son that was seized by customs agents at the
Canadian border.
   The self-portrait by nationally known photographer Walter
Chappell dates to the early 1960s and has appeared in a picture
book of American nude photography published by Harper &amp; Row.
   The federal government's sudden interest in bringing an
obscenity case against the Chappell photograph comes at a time of
national debate on freedom of expression in such diverse issues as
flag burning and the lyrics of the rap group 2 Live Crew.
   The investigation of Sturges began after Newell Colour, a photo
lab, notified authorities of negatives of nude girls ages 9-11.
Semien, 26, was arrested April 25 after picking up some of Sturges'
photos from the lab.
   A state law intended to fight child abuse requires all
film-processing companies to report any material showing a child
under 14 engaged in ``sexual conduct.'' Sexual conduct is defined
as ``exhibition of the genitals ... for the purpose of sexual
stimulation of the viewer.''
   Sturges' lawyer contends the law is unconstitutional because
it's vague.
   ``It's a sense of taste,'' said attorney Michael H. Metzger.
``There are certainly some people who may find it to be tasteless.
But nothing Sturges ever did in any way exploits or is harmful to
children.''
   ``I think he's a talented, serious photographer. The idea that
his work is somehow obscene or pornographic is ludicrous,'' said
Peter Galassi, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York. The museum has a Sturges photograph in its collection,
and his work has been displayed in the Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris.
   ``I'm an artist,'' Sturges said. ``I am to no extent a
pornographer.''

   Four arrests in the assassination of a Colombian
presidential candidate turned up an assault rifle that U.S.
authorities say came from a shipment of Israeli arms, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   New York Newsday quoted Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as saying the rifle was
part of an arms shipment Israel says was intended for the defense
force of the island of Antigua.
   Israel has maintained it does not know how weapons from the
shipment of 500 Galil rifles and Uzi machine pistols were diverted,
with some reaching the late Colombian drug boss Jose Rodriguez
Gacha.
   In the Aug. 18 assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, drug
traffickers allegedly fired rifles as a diversion before killing
the presidential candidate with a machine pistol.
   The assassination prompted a government crackdown on Colombia's
drug barons and a wave of terrorism. Colombia has blamed the terror
on Gacha's forces, which it claimed were trained by Israeli reserve
officers led by Lt. Col. Yair Klein.
   Newsday said that Colombian authorities discovered the Israeli
Galil rifle among weapons in two Bogota safehouses raided when they
arrested the suspected assassins Sept. 21.
   Israeli Embassy press attache Ruth Yaron in Washington did not
return repeated phone calls, Newsday reported.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of a Senate narcotics
subcommittee, said the new disclosure was disturbing, and he urged
an investigation.

   ``This is a major step toward giving tribal governments full
authority and responsibility for governing their reservations,''
Eddie F. Brown, assistant Interior secretary, said in Washington,
D.C.
   ``These agreements are historic for these tribes and for the
BIA,'' he said.
   The agreements and Brown's comments were reported Wednesday from
Washington by The Daily Oklahoman and the Tulsa World.
   John Ketcher, deputy principal chief of the Tahlequah,
Okla.-based Cherokee Nation, said tribal leaders were looking
forward to having more flexibility in using federal funds.
   ``The problem with the BIA in the past has been that once they
get locked into something, it's difficult for them to change
direction,'' Ketcher said.
   The agreements go into effect Oct. 1, the beginning of the next
fiscal year. Of the five tribes, the Cherokee Nation has the
largest amount of funds to be administered, $6.1 million next year.
   Brown said the agreements are expected to eliminate 20 to 30
full-time BIA positions.
   Former BIA head Ross Swimmer of Oklahoma, Mankiller's
predecessor as Cherokee chief, was one of the first to gain support
for self-governance, said agency spokesman Carl Shaw.
   A 1988 law allows 20 tribes to participate in agreements to
control their own funds with minimal federal interference. The law
also requires the Interior secretary to maintain its ``trust
responsibility'' in Indian affairs.

<HEAD>Two Men Testify About Finding Female Jogger</HEAD>

   Police were sitting in a car about 40 yards from
where a naked and bloodied female jogger lay moaning and nearly
dead in Central Park last April, two men testified.
   Vinicio Moore, 38, testified Tuesday that he was walking through
the park with a friend when they heard a faint moan coming from a
muddy spot in a gully.
   ``I heard somebody go, `Uuuhhh! Uuuuhhhh! Uuhh!''' Moore said.
``I didn't know if it was a man or a woman, but I knew it was a
body.''
   Neither Moore nor his companion saw or heard anyone leaving the
area. Moore's companion, Carlos Colon, who also testified Tuesday,
said they didn't get too close because they feared attack. Moore
said he could see a body covered with mud.
   ``The night was clear,'' he said. ``There was moonlight. It was
warm.'' Moore said he thought it was about 12:30 a.m., April 20,
1989.
   ``Carlos said, `Look! Look! Look! Look, Vinny, look!'' Moore
said, ``Carlos was the first one who saw her.''
   ``We ran up the hill and there was a police car,'' Moore said.
``We talked to the police. We got into the car and drove down the
hill and we showed them there was a body there.''
   From spots Moore pointed out on a map and pictures of the park,
it seems the police were parked only 30 to 40 yards from where the
woman was found thrashing in the mud and gagging on a bloodied
T-shirt stuffed in her mouth.
   Colon, 24, testified he was walking about 5 feet ahead of his
friend. ``I heard moaning, so I looked back,'' Colon said. ``I saw
a body moving. I didn't know if the person who did it was still
around, and I didn't want to stay there and find out. ...
   ``When they turned the body over we saw it was a woman,'' he
said. ``She had two holes in her head. Her face was bruised. Her
hands were like this.''
   The witness closed his hands into fists, put them together with
palms facing, and pulled them up to his face.
   ``She had a gag in her mouth,'' Colon continued. ``I asked the
police to take the gag out of her mouth because she looked like she
couldn't breathe. He had trouble taking it out, so I helped him.''
   The men were testifying in Manhattan's state Supreme Court at
the trial of Antron McCray, 15, Raymond Santana, 16, and Yusef
Salaam, 16, charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse,
assault, robbery and riot in the attack on the woman and two male
joggers.
   The female jogger, an investment banker who was then 28, was
gang-raped, savagely beaten, and left naked and near death.
   She survived, but suffered brain damage and has no recollection
of what happened to her that night, Assistant District Attorney
Elizabeth Lederer said. The prosecutor has refused to say whether
the woman will testify.
   McCray, Santana and Salaam are on trial in an adult court, but
if convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to
10 years in prison.
   Three other youngsters charged in the attacks, Steven Lopez, 15,
Kevin Richardson, 15, and Kharey Wise, 17, are to stand trial on
the same charges later this year.

<HEAD>NATO Members Wary of Meddling with Their Successful Alliance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-NATO, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Major members of NATO go to London this week reluctant to change
the alliance that has prevented conflict during the Cold War and
the advent of nuclear weaponry.
   After 41 years of an alliance pitted against the Warsaw Pact,
the 16 nations that make up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
must rethink how they will keep the peace.
   The Communist governments of Eastern Europe that supported the
Warsaw Pact have been swept away in the last year by popular
revolutions. The new governments, for the most part, have insisted
that Soviet forces be withdrawn from their soil and that the
East-West armed confrontation be ended.
   NATO leaders on Thursday and Friday must decide how the Western
world will ensure its safety and what future role the alliance
might play.
   Members will wrestle with proposals to change NATO's focus _
from a military alliance to a political forum; its strategy, from
containing communism to regional peacekeeping; and even its
membership, with the suggested admission of East Germany.
   Here are some views about the alliance's future:
   _ West Germany wants NATO membership extended to both halves of
a united Germany, and to develop the Atlantic alliance into ``a
stability-oriented partnership with the Soviet Union and other
European countries ...,'' Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
has said.
   Genscher also wants a broader role of the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which deals with
military security, economic cooperation and human rights.
   _ Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said last week:
   ``There exists a clear consciousness that the Atlantic Alliance
is not replaceable and that the trans-Atlantic link (with the
United States and Canada) should be maintained.''
   ``That someone might propose the elimination of NATO would seem
to me an attempt to ignore the history of the 20th century, ignore
that there was a World War (II),'' he said.
   _ British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, traditionally the
most hawkish of the Western leaders, is adamant that NATO should
remain as a defense alliance complete with nuclear weapons and U.S.
troops deployed in Western Europe.
   ``You do not cancel your home insurance policy just because
there have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12
months,'' the Conservative Party prime minister told NATO foreign
ministers last month.
   Britain is replacing its aging nuclear weapons with a $9-billion
U.S. Trident missile system.
   British officials also say there will likely be a reduction in
the 66,700 British troops based in West Germany.
   _ Norwegian Defense Minister Per Ditlev-Simonsen is in general
agreement. Norway has seen little effect from military changes in
the East Bloc. In fact, the Soviet Union is modernizing and has
moved forces from Central Europe to its Kola Pennisula bases, near
its arctic border with Norway, Ditlev-Simonsen said. Backfire
bombers are now stationed at Kola, and Flogger fighter-bombers
withdrawn from Hungary went to the north flank, he added.
   His spokesman, Erik Senstad, said: ``We want NATO to stay the
way it is, with Germany as a member.''
   _ French officials are staying out of public debate on details
of NATO's future. They continue to insist they will remain outside
its military wing.
   Asked about pleas that France rejoin the unified miltary
structure that it left in 1966, President Francois Mitterrand's
spokesman, Hubert Vedrine said: ``The answer is no.''
   Vedrine also indicated France has backed away from its earlier
suggestions that the CSCE be developed into a continent-wide
security body that would supercede NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``NATO is an alliance for defense,'' Vedrine said. ``The CSCE is
not an alliance ... We cannot push it as a substitute.''
   _ U.S. officials have remained vague about the role NATO should
take overseeing Europe, although the administration of President
Bush believes the alliance should gradually evolve from a military
to a more political union, in which a unified Germany will be
anchored.
   ``NATO has been the most successful defensive alliance in
history. It is and it must remain a coherent force for peace,''
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said last Thursday.
   With some promptings from U.S. allies, Baker has gradually
shifted his view to say that the CSCE should be bolstered to
provide a new security arrangement for Europe. But he and other
officials see the forum more as a tool to help spread democracy in
Europe and help the transition from government-controlled to market
economies.
   _ Belgium, on the other hand, seeks a greater profile for the
CSCE. It wants a permanent CSCE secretariat as ``an embryonic form
of a greater Pan-European security structure,'' said Foreign
Minister Mark Eyskens said in a recent position paper.

   President Bush declared parts of
Nebraska a major disaster area Wednesday from the severe storms,
tornadoes and flooding that struck the state last month.
   The declaration, issued at the president's vacation home here,
makes federal funds available for the recovery effort in a
14-county area.
   The counties are: Buffalo, Colfax, Dodge, Douglas, Gage,
Hitchcock, Madison, Platte, Red Willow, Sharpy, Sherman, Stanton,
Thurston and Washington.
   The federal aid includes temporary housing, grants, low-cost
loans and other help for both individuals and business owners. The
government also normally pays up to 75 percent of the costs of
repairing or replacing damaged public facilities.
   The severe weather struck the state beginning June 10.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is still surveying other
areas of the state to determine whether the disaster declaration
should be extended to other counties.
   Edward A. Thomas of FEMA's Boston regional office was named to
coordinate federal recovery operations.

   Designer Calvin Klein was in a Manhattan
hospital Wednesday with a concussion, two broken ribs and other
injuries suffered after being thrown from a horse at a Long Island
riding stable.
   Klein, 47, was in stable condition at New York Hospital, where
he was flown by helicopter Tuesday night, said Mary Cialone, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   He also had a bruised lung and cuts on his head, she said. He
would probably remain hospitalized for about a week.
   ``The doctors expect a quick and complete recovery,'' said Paul
Wilmot, a spokesman for Klein.
   He said the fashion designer was riding his horse at a stable in
Bridgehampton when ``something spooked the horse.''
   He described Klein, who has a home in nearby East Hampton, as a
good rider.
   Wilmot, reached at his home in Rhode Island, said he spoke
Wednesday morning with Klein by telephone.
   Asked if Klein mentioned riding again, Wilmot said, ``I don't
think you'd want to ask him that today.''

   Princess Diana gave Spanish tenor Jose Carreras an
honorary membership in the Royal Academy of Music on Wednesday.
   Carreras, who resumed his singing career two years ago after
bone marrow surgery for leukemia, traveled here for the school's
graduation ceremony.
   ``It is a great honor because this is one of the most
prestigious institutions for music in the world and it is a very
special moment for me,'' the 44-year-old star said.
   Carreras is scheduled to perform in Rome this weekend with opera
stars Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo as part of the World
Cup soccer tournament finale.
   German-born conductor Klaus Tennstedt, the conductor laureate of
the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and international violinists
Erich Gruenberg and Gyorgy Pauk, also were made honorary members of
the academy.

   His friends include Marcello Mastroianni and
Vanessa Redgrave. The Mayor of Rome gave him ``Most Likable
Person'' of the year prize. From Milan to Naples to Florence,
people stop him in the streets for autographs.
   Not bad for a 10-year-old.
   ``I get letters saying to maintain my naturalness,'' said
Salvatore ``Toto'' Cascio, the projectionist's invaluable assistant
in ``Cinema Paradiso,'' which won the Academy Award for best
foreign film. ``Everyone wants to have my picture.''
   ``Cinema Paradiso'' was Salvatore's film debut. In fact, he had
never seen a movie since there was no theater in his hometown of
Palermo, Sicily.
   ``They made the selection among 300 children,'' he explained
Tuesday through an interpreter during an interview at a Manhattan
hotel. ``After this selection, myself and another boy were chosen.
They then had another rehearsal and I was ultimately picked.
   ``I wasn't nervous. I slept very well.''
   Now, Salvatore is almost everywhere. He's completed five more
films, appearing with Mastroianni, Redgrave and Peter Ustinov among
others, and says he's seen ``Cinema Paradiso'' 16 times.
   ``Maybe I'll do another picture this summer,'' he said. ``Then I
will go on vacation.''

   Thousands of women may consider talk-show host
Phil Donahue to be the ideal husband, but the one who married him
says he's far from perfect.
   ``Phil is the greatest husband in the world, and he's nothing to
brag about,'' Marlo Thomas told the General Federation of Women's
Clubs convention Tuesday.
   She says her husband shares a trait common among married men _
always asking their wives where their shoes, keys and other
belongings are.
   ``And the thing that kills me is, we know where those things
are!''
   Thomas also told the group at a Times Square hotel that women
get a bum rap in the business world.
   ``A man has to be Joe McCarthy to be called ruthless,'' she
said. ``All a woman has to do is put you on hold.''

   A man robbed a convenience store, then shot
himself to death in front of horrified onlookers after asking
sheriff's deputies to shoot him, authorities said.
   The man was identified Wednesday as Darcy Willey, 24, of Tacoma.
   After the man robbed the suburban Lakewood store Tuesday, he was
cornered in a parking lot, authorities said.
   ``We asked him to put the weapon down. He refused,'' said Curt
Benson of the Pierce County sheriff's office.
   ``He kept putting it in his mouth and at his temple. We tried to
encourage him to surrender. At one point he said, `Will you shoot
me?'''
   When deputies refused, the man pulled the trigger, Benson said.
   The suicide was seen by 10 to 20 people, said Benson.
   A sheriff's chaplain was summoned to counsel them as well as the
deputies, he added.

<HEAD>Marion Hart Dies at 98; Made Seven Solo Flights Across Atlantic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Rice Hart, an adventurer who
sailed around the world and made seven solo flights across the
Atlantic, has died of pneumonia. She was 98.
   Hart, who died Monday, first learned to fly at age 54 and earned
worldwide acclaim for her feats.
   ``I wanted to see the world. I don't want to just sit around the
house,'' the then-81-year-old Hart told a reporter in 1972 before
she climbed into her single-engine aircraft in Katmandu, Nepal.
   ``The feminist movement didn't mean much to her because she did
whatever she wanted before feminism came in,'' said her niece,
Dorothy Rice.
   Hart was born Oct. 2, 1891, in London. She married a mining
engineer and the couple lived in Arizona and California before
divorcing.
   After learning to fly, Hart piloted her single-engine plane
non-stop across the Atlantic at age 61.
   She later flew all over the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa
and South America, and made at least six more solo flights across
the Atlantic, the last at age 83.
   ``She always wanted to get into Russia,'' said Dorothy Rice.
``She wrote to Mrs. Khrushchev, but they would only permit it if
she had a Soviet guide and she never wanted that. She refused.''
   Hart received the Harmon International Trophy from Vice
President Walter Mondale in 1976. The award recognized her feats
operating a ``small aircraft on a global scale.''
   Hart, whose parents left her a comfortable trust fund, was the
first woman to graduate in chemical engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   In 1936, Hart cast off for what became a three-year voyage
sailing around the world on her 72-foot ketch.
   Hart took to flying after working as a radio operator for the
Army Air Corps during World War II. She stopped flying at age 87
after she overshot the runway at the Tucson, Ariz., airport on a
trip back from Mexico. The plane is in the Tucson Pima Air Museum.
   Hart is survived by one nephew and four nieces. At her request,
no funeral service will be held.

<HEAD>Anonymous Pamphlet Urges Jewish Settlers To Shoot Arabs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pamphlet distributed among Jewish settlers
urged them to shoot Palestinians and gave detailed instructions on
how to obtain guns and avoid capture, according to media reports
Wednesday.
   The anonymous pamphlet, quoted by the Hebrew daily Yediot
Ahronot and state radio, advises settlers to gather explosives from
the army, masquerade as soldiers during attacks and leave behind
misleading evidence.
   It says the settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
should respond to stoning attacks on their cars with gunfire and
should try to ``hit and cause much damage.''
   The pamphlet also urges retribution against Palestinians.
   ``You must react to every Arab stone with secret revenge acts,''
the leaflet was quoted as saying. ``Cause damage to Arab property.''
   The reports come at a time of rising tension between settlers
and Palestinians, who have carried out an uprising against Israeli
occupation for more than 30 months. In the uprising, at least 721
Palestinians have been slain by Israeli gunfire and 45 Israelis
have died.
   The daily Haaretz quoted security sources as saying stalled
peace efforts could push Palestinian extremists to attack Jewish
settlements.
   Liberal politicians have accused the right-wing government of
encouraging radicals among the settlers.
   Yediot said the pamphlets were put into settlers' mailboxes, but
it was unclear how many were distributed or in which settlements.
The pamphlet was not signed and news reports gave no evidence of
who printed it.
   More than 130 Jewish settlements have been built in the West
Bank and Gaza since the territories were captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. About 75,000 Jews live there
among 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Israel Harel, a settler leader, said he checked eight
settlements and found no sign of the pamphlets. ``This pamphlet is
simply not known in the settlements,'' he said.
   Zvi Katzover, head of the Kiryat Arba settlement in the West
Bank, said the pamphlet was probably done by a ``fringe group.'' He
said, however, the advice ``should not be ignored ... to try and
catch stone throwers at almost any price.''
   Politicians on both left and right expressed fears the pamphlet
could be evidence that a new Jewish underground was forming,
similar to one that targeted and killed several Palestinian leaders
in the early 1980s.
   Parliament member Ran Cohen of the liberal Citizens' Rights
Movement said the pamphlet ``not only calls for the murder of
innocent Arabs ... but also the impersonation of army soldiers.''
   Cohen said he sent copies of the pamphlet to authorities.
   Lawmaker Geula Cohen of the right-wing Tehiya Party said the
pamphlet was ``madness.''
   ``This is really an underground, not against the Arabs but
against the state of Israel,'' she told Yediot.
   According to the radio, the pamphlet outlines a scenario in
which two settlers are in a car nearing an area where Palestinian
youths often stone settlers' cars.
   The pamphlet says: ``Your friend moves into the back seat,
handgun in hand. ... In front of you a stone is thrown. Your friend
opens a window and empties his magazine. He tries to hit and cause
much damage.''
   The pamphlet goes on to to say that to mislead investigators,
the settlers should then sprinkle on the roadside empty cartridges
not from their own weapons.
   Among the instructions quoted from the pamphlet were:
   _ ``Collect explosives, fuses, delaying fuses, detonators. The
primary source: the army.
   _ ``Arm yourself with an M-16 assault rifle. Take the weapon
from your settlement's armory or from your army unit....
   _ ``When you go on an operation, wear army fatigues and a
stocking cap.
   _ ``How not to be caught: If you use your weapon, do not report
to a civilian control center or the military. ... Wipe fingerprints
from the weapon.''

<HEAD>Ex-KGB Agent: Soviet Defectors Destroying Intelligence Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB counterintelligence chief says about
20 agents who have defected to the West in the past decade have
caused the ``total collapse'' of many Soviet spy rings.
   Oleg D. Kalugin, who worked as an operative in the United States
from 1958 to 1970 but has since been dismissed from the KGB and
stripped of his rank as major general, made his latest revelation
about the agency in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   At an anti-Communist rally Tuesday evening, Kalugin blamed KGB
chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov for what he called ``criminal
negligence and incompetence, which led to the mass desertion of KGB
agents and demoralized intelligence.''
   In recent weeks, Kalugin has been waging a public relations
campaign against the KGB, through interviews with Western reporters
and in articles in reformist Soviet newspapers. He has said the KGB
still taps telephones, infiltrates Soviet life, including the
Russian Orthodox church and labor organizations, and engages in
dirty tricks.
   Kalugin has embraced the reform policies of the radical
Democratic Platform, alleging his superiors drummed him out of the
agency because of his politics.
   After his Tuesday speech, which at times evoked populist themes
that a candidate for office would use, many in the crowd chanted
``Well done!'' and a few urged him to run for the Soviet parliament.
   In the newspaper article, he denied allegations by his former
superiors that he himself was responsible for leaks of information.
   ``Since 1960 until 1980, three KGB agents defected to the
West,'' Kalugin wrote. ``And since 1980, about 20 have already
betrayed the motherland.
   ``Thus we can boldly speak not of an information leak but about
a majority of Soviet intelligence's secrets sold to the West, about
the total collapse of a great number of intelligence networks,'' he
added. ``But all this is being thoroughly concealed from the
public.''
   A separate letter by Soviet lawmakers printed in Komsomolskaya
Pravda urged an investigation of Kalugin's allegations by the
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   At the rally Tuesday evening, he said his ex-bosses claimed he
had been living in the United States too long. Kalugin said he had
not been affected by America's ``material benefits,'' but rather by
the civil rights movement led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
and students protesting the Vietnam War.
   He also delivered a stinging attack on the KGB's hard-line
chiefs, to the delight of a crowd of more than 4,000 people who
earlier had been shouting ``Shame on the KGB!''
   ``The people who are now in the leadership of the KGB are mainly
those who bear full responsibility for the injustice and crimes
committed against the Soviet people and our society,'' Kalugin said.
   The men in leadership positions of the KGB for the past 15 to 20
years were ``chips off Stalin's and Brezhnev's empire,'' Kalugin
said, referring to former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid
Brezhnev.
   He also blamed the KGB for recent unrest in the Soviet Union's
Caucasian and Central Asian republics.
   ``I'll say that the KGB did not fulfill its basic role when it
failed to prevent ethnic conflicts and failed to provide stability
for society,'' he said.
   Years of lawlessness by the agency was responsible for
``millions of lost lives, millions of broken lives,'' he said.

   The grape farmer was in the front row,
and the plumber and vacuum-cleaner salesman were close by.
   That was the payoff for cajoling country-rock star Jerry Jeff
Walker to give a concert in the picture-postcard village of North
East on the shore of Lake Erie.
   Walker acknowledged the plumber-turned-promoter by sporting an
``Ollinger's Plumbing, Heating and Air Conditioning'' T-shirt under
his black jacket. He traded his beige felt cowboy hat for a maroon
North East baseball cap.
   ``I like a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it,''
Walker hollered to the screams and shouts of 250 fans who packed a
barn-turned-restaurant for Walker's concert Tuesday night. ``And
they said it couldn't be done.''
   Chuck Ollinger got the idea of a Walker concert so Ollinger and
his buddies could have front-row seats to hear one of their
favorite singers.
   Ollinger called Walker's agent and struck a deal that Ollinger
would put half the money up front.
   ``It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing,'' said Ollinger,
36. ``We had no idea what we were doing.''
   ``It was either going to fly or else it was going to be a real
expensive Fourth of July,'' said Bill Neil, 36, a grape farmer who
put up some of the advance money. The amount was not disclosed.
   Walker catapulted to fame in 1968 when he recorded the
now-classic ``Mr. Bojangles.'' Other hits include ``L.A. Freeway''
and ``Up Against the Wall, Redneck.''
   ``These guys wanted me here, and they paid my money,'' Walker,
48, said before taking to the makeshift stage at the Delhurst
Country Inn.
   ``I do the solo thing this way ... for economic reasons. When
guys are carrying six, seven, eight people around, they keep
themselves out of the market. I did that longer and longer with
less and less money to show for it.''
   Ollinger wanted to bring Walker to North East after he saw him
perform at a small club in Pittsburgh, about 150 miles to the
south. He called Walker's agent and struck a deal that required
Ollinger put half the money up front before a contract could be
signed. To Walker, it was a good arrangement because he was headed
to his 30th high school reunion in Oneonta this Saturday.
   Ollinger tapped four friends to help _ Neil; Rich Timer, a
computer salesman; Brad Wallace, a vacuum cleaner salesman; and
Randy Cunningham, a car dealer. They signed the contract at the end
of May.
   With the help of a local radio station and word-of-mouth
advertising, the $18 tickets were sold out in four days.
   ``We could have sold at least 500 tickets with the limited
advertising we did _ more if we spent money on advertising,'' said
Timer, 36.

   Among speakers at Wednesday's session of the
Communist Party congress was Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin,
considered one of the main architects of the Kremlin's current plan
for a transition to a market economy. His remarks were translated
by The Associated Press:
   
   The fate of socialism and the socialist ideal should not be tied
to just one of its models. Now it has become clear that there are
more than one _ and quite varied _ models of forming socialism. And
the failure of one of these models does not mean the crash of the
idea of the socialist choice itself. Among these models can be
those that correspond to general models of social progress, and
those that represent a blind alley of social development. The model
based on full state ownership of property, on liquidation of
various forms of enterprise, and the negation of the market is not
capable of maintaining high social and economic results.
   We often say we built the wrong socialism, now we'll build
another, humane and democratic. I think we should be clear that we
did not build socialism and have not lived in the conditions of a
socialist society. Otherwise we'll have to admit that a society in
which the problems of food supply, feeding the people, solving the
housing problem, a society without the institutions of a democratic
government are absent, can be called socialist.
   If we want a more effective economy, oriented toward technical
progress; if we want stores full of varied products of high
quality; if we want to be done with the shame of lines, speculation
and closed stores; if we want to create a strong enough stimulus
for labor, we have no other choice but the transition to a market
economy. A lot hinders us in this, including what I mentioned
before, dogma and myth.
   There are general laws of social progress. They can't be
canceled. ... Any party or social organization that tries to hinder
this process, try to go against the logic of social progress, will
inevitably be pushed aside from the historical battle and meet
defeat. I think our congress has enough wisdom, calm and confidence
in the achievements of contemporary science to make the right
decision.

  Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday gave himself and
the Soviet leadership two years to improve citizens' lives or
resign.
   ``I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this
leadership must go,'' Gorbachev told a TV interviewer as he entered
the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the third day of the Communist
Party's 28th congress.
   It was the first time that the Soviet president and party
leader, who is facing bitter criticism from both radical reformers
and party traditionalists, has given himself and the leadership a
deadline for turning around the country's political, economic and
social problems.
   A Western journalist who was on the scene said Gorbachev had
been asked what should happen if there are no improvements in the
Soviet Union in two years.
   Speaking confidently in a videotaped segment shown on the
nightly TV news program ``Vremya,'' he denied that the Kremlin
leadership would do anything to hold onto political power.
   ``No!'' he said. ``I will tell you, before perestroika we had
more power. I don't know who had more power than the general
secretary of the Central Committee.''
   The leadership has made mistakes, he said. But he praised its
courage in starting his reform program.
   He did not specify who should be covered by his self-imposed
deadline, but it seemed likely that it was meant for both party and
government leaders. Most important Soviet officials still hold
important posts in both the Communist Party and the Soviet
government.
   Earlier Wednesday, Gorbachev heard more bitter criticism of his
program inside the congress hall from regional party officials, who
accused the leadership of cowardice and indecision in an
ideological battle against growing anti-Communist sentiments.
   Underscoring the mood, more than 4,600 delegates to the
Communist Party's 28th Congress sat sullenly as Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid A. Abalkin warned that resisting reform would lead
the party to disaster.
   ``Our position today reminds of an army that is retreating in
haste without a plan,'' said Nursultan Nazarbaev, party chief in
the Kazakhstan republic, as he pleaded for clearer direction from
the Kremlin.
   But despite the criticism, speakers displayed no new ideas and
no alternative to re-electing Gorbachev.
   The congress made a special appeal to one of most anti-Communist
elements of society _ disgruntled coal miners _ not to strike. In a
resolution, it said that a repetition of last year's walkout could
``lead to a breakup of the country's economy.''
   Regional leaders blamed their bosses in the Kremlin for
ecological disasters surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,
Central Asia's shrinking Aral Sea and its overdependence on cotton
production, and poor social and economic conditions that are
causing an increasing number of Soviets to blame the party as the
source of their problems.
   Gorbachev listened quietly to the criticism, which came mainly
from party leaders of some of the 15 Soviet republics, large
cities, and ministers in charge of important sectors of the economy.
   He heard much of the same criticism the previous day from fellow
members of the party's ruling Politburo, but he appeared to remain
in firm control of the congress.
   The regional party leaders, echoing a poll of delegates released
by the state news agency Tass, demanded that the national
leadership give them clearer direction.
   They heaped criticism on party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev,
who was jeered as he spoke on Monday, the first day of the congress.
   Nazarbaev, the party chief in Kazakhstan, was warmly applauded
when he complained that the party's opponents ``heap buckets of mud
on Lenin and Leninsim, and the cowardly activities of our
ideologists led by Medvedev demoralized our forces.''
   Vitaly Perov, representing a region near Moscow, accused
Medvedev and Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev of ``hiding in
the trenches'' while radicals from the Democratic Platform reform
group seize the initiative.
   Anatoly Poruchikov, director of a central Russian state farm,
said in a speech that farmers are not impressed with the
government's reforms.
   ``We are like a big cow for you, you milk us non-stop,'' he
complained. ``What will happen to you if we all stop?''
   ``We're all sick of your extreme pluralism and democracy,'' he
declared.
   Stanislav I. Gurenko, newly elected head of the Ukrainian party,
said: ``We should rebuff mud-slinging slander, we should not
retreat from our positions, we should stop committing suicide, we
should stop this self-flagellation.''
   ``We underestimated the danger of anti-communism,'' Gurenko
said. As party chief in the Soviet Union's second-largest republic,
he faces an anti-Communist challenge not only in the Don River coal
mining basin in the eastern Ukraine, but in the troublesome western
region near Lvov.
   Miners' representatives meeting in Donetsk last month condemned
the Communist Party for hindering reforms. They announced plans for
a short political strike on July 11 if Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, also a leading Communist official, does not quit.
   Despite the criticism, speaker after speaker said there was no
alternative to giving Gorbachev another five-year term as party
chief.
   ``Gorbachev started perestroika and party members support him,''
said Yefrem Sokolov, a traditionalist republican party leader from
Byelorussia.

<HEAD>Pratt &amp; Whitney Orders Recall of Newest Jet Engines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney has recalled more than
three dozen of its newest, largest jet engines in response to a
compressor problem that, if left unchecked, could have prompted an
in-flight engine shutdown.
   The problem was discovered in one PW4000 engine compressor,
Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan said Tuesday. He said none of the
recalled engines was in use by an airline.
   The problem stemmed from a tightening of the blade-tip clearance
in the engine's high-pressure compressor, a ``performance
improvement'' Pratt introduced in February. Sullivan said the
reduced clearance meant rotating compressor blades were rubbing a
bit harder against rub strips inside the engine casing.
   Although there were no problems in ground testing for the first
38 improved-performance engines, the 39th engine had excessive rub,
causing the compressor to stall.
   Sullivan said East Hartford-based Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of
Hartfort-based United Technologies Corp., is satisfied that the
problem has been corrected. He said the problem caused a ``very
minimal disruption to our customers and their delivery schedules.''
   Pratt has been marketing the PW4000 engine for the many jumbo
jets expected to enter service in the 1990s. The first 38 engines
had been shipped to aircraft builders Boeing Co. in Seattle,
McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach, Calif., and Airbus Industrie
in Toulouse, France, Sullivan said.
   To replace the recalled engines, Pratt delivered new PW4000s
with the original blade-tip clearance, Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Court Orders Attorneys to Testify Who Paid Fees in Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED BRIDIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors hope testimony from five
Oklahoma and Texas lawyers about the source of their legal fees
will help in the drug conspiracy case against a Dallas businessman.
   The attorneys say the testimony comes under duress.
   ``I just think it's a shame,'' Tulsa lawyer John Echols said
Tuesday. ``It's another example of what the war on drugs is doing
to liberty in America.''
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled Monday
the five must testify who paid their fees in the case that led to
the 1987 federal drug conviction of four operators of a lab that
made methamphetamine, or ``speed.''
   ``You're going to wake up some day and wish you could talk to an
attorney in confidence,'' Echols said. ``It may be that in any one
case it doesn't threaten liberty, but if you transfer that to all
cases, it does.''
   Stanley Monroe, the other Tulsa attorney affected by the ruling,
called the court's decision ``a sad day for the U.S. Constitution.''
   ``Of course, I'm disappointed,'' said Monroe, who declined to
comment further until he was able to review the 33-page ruling.
   The court order caps months of legal maneuvers that at one point
sent the attorneys to prison on a contempt citation for refusal to
testify before a grand jury.
   The appeals court stayed the contempt charge hours later, and
ordered the attorneys freed. But Monday's ruling upheld U.S.
District Judge James O. Ellison's decision to jail the five in
Tulsa.
   U.S. Attorney Tony Graham said Tuesday he would not seek to have
the attorneys jailed again.
   ``I don't intend to be vindictive,'' he said. ``If I were, I
could ask they be put in jail now. But I don't intend to let this
case linger.''
   Federal prosecutors contend Dallas businessman James Coltharp
may have paid the attorneys' fees. Graham said that information
could be used to prove Coltharp operated a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   Coltharp's federal trial on drug conspiracy and possession
charges is scheduled to begin in August. His indictment was
unsealed March 7 in Tulsa.
   Graham said if prosecutors were able to prove the attorneys'
fees came from illegal drug transactions, ``then that money was the
government's money from the moment the crook came in possession of
it.''
   Echols, Monroe and the other lawyers _ Scott Anderson, James
Walker and Tex McConathy of Dallas _ argued fee information is a
privileged communication between attorney and client.
   But the appeals court said there was no evidence that testifying
to the grand jury would create a conflict between the attorneys and
their clients. That test is one of several used in such cases.
   In its ruling, the three-judge panel said the attorneys must
tell the grand jury the source of their legal fees, the amount of
the fees and the names of anyone at least partly responsible for
paying them.
   The attorneys also must provide all documents related to paying
or accepting those fees, including checks, deposit slips, wire
transfers and certain tax forms.
   The court refused to order the attorneys to provide copies of
any fee contracts and passed the issue to the district court for a
decision.

   In their public statements, delegates to the
Communist Party congress are critical of many of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms. But in their hearts, most seem to believe the
party would be lost without him.
   Despite hard-line attacks on Gorbachev's policy of perestroika,
many delegates to the 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party
say they expect to re-elect him as party general secretary, a post
he has held since 1985.
   Five speakers from across the party spectrum endorsed Gorbachev
from the podium on Wednesday, prompting several delegates to pass
notes forward asking for a ban on the practice.
   ``Mikhail Sergeyevich (Gorbachev), please appeal to the
delegates not to praise you and make an icon of you, because it
creates the opposite reaction in the hall and the country,'' said
one request, read by the acting chairman, Islam A. Karimov, first
secretary of the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   The party, which seemed on the point of rupture in the weeks
before the congress, was gathering in Gorbachev's banner _ for the
time being.
   Members of the hard-line majority, who two weeks ago urged
Gorbachev to relinquish his party job and keep the national
presidency, had dropped that demand by the time the congress opened
Monday.
   And members of the reformist Democratic Platform, consisting of
about 100 of the nearly 4,700 delegates, were faltering in their
earlier decision to quit the party.
   Andrei Godunov, a Democratic Platform delegate from Leningrad,
said it was better to work for change within the party, and
advocated a ``centrist'' and ``pragmatic'' course.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a prominent reformer, told
reporters in the lobby of the Palace of Congresses that ``there
must be a platform of consolidation'' at the party meeting.
   He said he was leaning toward re-electing Gorbachev, although he
opposed the idea of the same person heading both the party and the
state.
   At the other end of the political spectrum, Leningrad hard-liner
Boris Gidaspov delivered a surprisingly mild speech endorsing
Gorbachev's effort to shift power from the party to government
bodies and elected legislatures.
   Gorbachev's leading hard-line critic, Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev, said on national television two weeks ago that Gorbachev
should not continue to be the national president and head of the
Communist Party.
   But on Tuesday, in a blistering critique of Gorbachev's reforms,
Ligachev carefully avoided a personal attack on him, and did not
repeat his demand to elect someone who could devote full time to
party work.
   KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, who followed Ligachev's lead
in attacking the reform movement, nevertheless told reporters he
would back Gorbachev for general secretary.
   A reformer from the Ukraine, newspaper editor Vitaly G.
Karpenko, joined conservatives in criticizing Gorbachev for
``combining the posts of president and party leader.''
   But, he said: ``If we have to vote, I shall vote for Gorbachev,
simply because there is no other alternative. ... It is Gorbachev
who will be able to consolidate the country.''
   Alexander Frolov, first secretary of the Surovsky region near
the central Russian city of Tula, said: ``We have no other leader
with more potential than Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.''
   Pressed to explain the mixed attitude to Gorbachev, Frolov fell
back on an old Russian proverb: ``He who works is scolded.''

<HEAD>Gov't Suspends Plans To Kill Seals In Response To Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday
temporarily suspended plans to kill 30,000 seals in response to
mounting criticism from local and foreign animal rights groups.
   Environment Minister Gert Kotze acknowledged that public outrage
was behind his decision to reconsider plans to kill 25,000 Cape fur
seal cubs and 5,000 adult male seals on the northwest coast later
this month.
   ``This is not backtracking at all, but it is fair towards the
public and conservationists to consider their objections, and I
want time to do that,'' Kotze told the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp.
   The government has granted a five-year permit to kill seals to a
Taiwanese business group, Jiuh Weh Industries. The company killed
more than 3,000 seals last year, but the culling was not publicized
and there were no protests.
   The seal bodies would be used for pet food while the males'
genitals are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East. The government
was to receive about 8 cents for each seal killed.
   The Earthlife Africa group said it welcomed the minister's
decision to temporarily suspend the culling.
   But it added, ``we would be far happier if there was a permanent
suspension _ until then we are carrying on with the battle.''
   Many countries have outlawed the killing of seals, and animal
rights groups say the practice should be banned in South Africa
because of its cruelty. The seals are clubbed on the head, then
stabbed in the heart so they bleed to death.
   South Africa has permitted the commerical culling of seals for
more than 70 years.
   Kotze said plans for the culling may proceed later.
   ``The culling of wild animals is always unpleasant, but,
unfortunately, cannot always be avoided,'' he told the South
African Broadcasting Corp.
   The Department of Environmental Affairs had been defending its
plans since local newspapers first reported the matter last week,
igniting the protests.
   The department said the culling would not endanger the country's
huge 1.2 million Cape Fur seal population. It said there was
evidence the growing seal population had contributed to a decline
in the number of jackass penguins and other sea animals as they
competed for resources.
   The seals could damage the South African fishing industry, it
said.
   The seals ``must therefore be seen as competitors with the
(fishing) industry, and maintaining high population levels of seals
could be costing this country both jobs and income,'' the
department said.

<TEXT>
   Former game show host Bill Cullen, whose many
credits include ``The Price is Right'' and ``To Tell The Truth,''
is critically ill with cancer, his manager said Wednesday.
   ``He has known for several months,'' manager George Spota said.
He said Cullen's family has requested the type of cancer not be
revealed, and declined to give any specifics about the illness.
   Cullen, 69, is receiving round-the-clock medical care at his Los
Angeles home, and has not been hospitalized for his disease, Spota
said.
   ``All things being equal, it's always best to be at home in a
situation like this,'' Spota said.
   The manager said Cullen's family this week decided to disclose
the illness because rumors about the former game show host's
sickness had begun to circulate.
   Cullen was the original host of ``The Price is Right,'' from
1957 to 1964, and has appeared in more than 35 network shows,
including ``I've Got a Secret,'' ``To Tell the Truth,'' ``Eye
Guess,'' and ``$25,000 Pyramid.''
   Spota called Cullen ``the dean of American game shows.''
   Cullen was working in a garage in Pittsburgh in 1939 when he got
his first job in broadcasting, as an unpaid assistant disc jockey.
He later became a regular announcer, earning $25 a week.
   In 1943, Cullen moved to New York and became a staff announcer
with the CBS Radio Network. A year later, he became announcer for
the ``Winner Take All'' game show.

<HEAD>Cuban Official in Moscow Reportedly Defects To Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Cuban economic official has
defected through Spain and now is under U.S. protection in Miami, a
Spanish newspaper reported today.
   The conservative daily ABC quoted Ramon Gonzalez Vergara as
saying he could ``not endure to live in Havana, where there is no
liberty.''
   A Cuban-American leader in Miami said Gonzalez Vergara would be
one of the highest civilian officials to defect from Cuba since
Fidel Castro took power in 1959.
   There was no immediate U.S. comment on the report.
   Gonzalez Vergara, 46, left Madrid Tuesday for Miami under the
care of U.S. agents, after first seeking political asylum in Spain,
the newspaper said.
   The paper said Gonzalez Vergara had been under police protection
in Spain since arriving June 25 by car from Moscow with his wife,
two children and mother-in-law.
   In an interview before he left for Miami, Gonzalez Vergara told
the paper that President Castro had named him to the post of deputy
secretary of the Council on Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon,
earlier this year.
   The Moscow-based Comecon coordinates economic policies of
current and former Communist nations, including the Soviet Union,
Eastern European countries, Cuba, Mongolia and Vietnam.
   Gonzalez Vergara told the paper he also had served as chief
negotiator in Moscow for Soviet aid.
   The newspaper quoted Vergara as saying a new aid agreement with
the Soviet Union is currently under discussion. U.S. officials
estimate Soviet aid to Cuba is $4.3 billion a year, but have
speculated that Kremlin budget-cutting and its ideological
differences with the hard-line Havana government would lead to
significant reductions.
   Gonzalez Vergara appeared to confirm some of this speculation.
   ``There will be aid on the part of the Soviet Union, but it will
be distinct (from past amounts), given the complicated economic
situation in the U.S.S.R.,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He characterized the Cuban economy as in ``a continued process
of decline. ... I don't see, in the short term, any exit to the
situation in Cuba.
   In Miami, Roberto Hernandez, vice president of the anti-Castro
Cuban American National Foundation, said he had heard the defection
report. If true, he said Gonzalez Vergara would be one of Cuba's
higher-ranking civilian defectors.
   ``We receive any defectors with open arms,'' Hernandez said.
``As long as they behave and with dignity, they will have our
support.''
   The foundation, which is planning for a Cuba after Castro's
rule, anticipates many defectors in coming months because of
deterioration in the Cuban economy, he said.

   A passel of pigs has been pressed into
service where poison and cannon have failed _ to get rid of sea
gulls that pose a nuisance and a health threat.
   In a one-month experiment, the Porker Patrol roams the half-mile
breakwall along Lake Huron at Michigan Limestone Operations Ltd.'s
Calcite plant.
   The swine are encouraged to eat gull eggs and chase the birds
who for years have nested messily on the wall. The gull droppings
combine with soil to make an ideal medium for growing histoplasma
capsulatum, a fungus that can cause a lung disease when inhaled.
   In 1980, 138 workers became ill after a pulley stored on the
breakwall was brought into the plant, prompting officials to launch
bird-ridding efforts.
   Roosting areas were layered with clay to suffocate the fungus,
permits were obtained letting workers break eggs and poison a few
gulls, and noisemakers ranging up to a cannon were employed. All
failed.
   Then Steve Truran, a plant manager, heard pigs had been used to
control gulls on an island on the Upper Peninsula.
   Enter Harold Claus, an employee who raises Yorkshires and loaned
the plant six, weighing about 100 pounds each.
   They're checked daily to be sure they're happy as, well, pigs in
slop.

   Two dozen wealthy nations on Wednesday

   Agreement to grant financial and other aid to Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and East Germany came at a meeting of
foreign ministers of 24 nations, including those of the European
Community, the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia.
   Romania was excluded because of doubts about its commitment to
democratic reforms.
   Aid to the Soviet Union was discussed but no decision was taken.
West Germany wants quick action on such aid. The United States and
Japan, among others, do not.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he wants to see more
reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``We take note of the fact that the Soviet Union is spending
somewhere between 18 and 25 percent of its gross domestic product
on military expenditures,'' he told reporters.
   Baker said the United States has problems the Soviet expenditure
of between $9 billion and $15 billion a year ``to support regimes
around the world that in the past at least have been hostile to the
views and interests and principles of the United States.''
   The Soviet Union, unlike the four countries added to the Western
aid program Wednesday, has not asked for Western aid.
   The 24 nations also disagreed over creating a special fund, of
possibly $10 billion to $12 billion, as a financial safety net for
East European nations.
   Frans Andriessen, the meeting chairman and EC external relations
commissioner, advanced the plan, but the ministers said this was
mostly a question for existing institutions such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
   Wednesday's meeting fixed no specific aid figures.
   These will emerge as each donor makes pledges in food, money,
credits, loan guarantees and other assistance.
   ``It was a conference designed to take stock, see whether we
should and could decided to add countries'' to the aid package,
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain told reporters.
   Aid to the new East European beneficiaries is bound to run into
billions of dollars in the long term.
   The 24 nations already have pledged more than $12.4 billion in
aid to Poland and Hungary since they began coordinating their aid
program last summer.
   The aid effort is coordinated by the European Community's
executive Commission.
   In a communique, the ministers said the four additional
beneficiaries of aid merited help in view of the reforms they have
begun ``based on the rule of law, the respect of human rights, the
introduction of multiparty systems, the holding of free and fair
elections and the establishment of market economies.''
   Of Romania, where authorities relied on miners last month to
suppress anti-government protests, they said:
   ``Recent events in Romania have not created the conditions in
which the implementation of coordinated assistance should be
extended to that country under present circumstances.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told
reporters regarding aid to Moscow, ``We cannot expect the Soviet
Union to resolve problems regarding the transition to a market
economy on their own.
   ``They urgently need help, not only financial but in the form of
advice. It is in the common Western interest to give this support.''
   Officials from Poland, Hungary and the four new beneficiary
countries attended the meeting.

   Germany will send a single team to the 1992
Olympics, the presidents of the two national Olympic committees
announced Wednesday.
   It will be the first time since the 1964 Olympic games in Tokyo
that Germany will compete with a unified team, and the merger is
expected to make the already strong German teams a powerhouse
single unit.
   Willi Daume, president of the West German Olympic Committee, and
Joachim Weiskopf, president of the counterpart East German
organization, said the two national Olympic committees will merge
in December to oversee the formation of a single team.
   The merger will follow the political unification of the two
German states, expected in early December.
   A united German team may be competing in international athletics
as early as March 1991, authorities in East Berlin said.
   The two Olympic committee presidents said there was ``complete
agreement'' between the two organisations about the decision.
   ``We had no dissenting opinions whatsoever,'' Daum said at a
news conference in East Berlin.
   ``The unification will be completed by the two Olympic
committees in an orderly fashion. We will be working intensively
together in the coming weeks,'' Daume said.
   ``We're moving ahead quickly for the sake of the athletes. A
fast merger is important in order to remove any uncertainty about
who will make the team,'' said Weiskopf.
   ``As the two Germanys grow together there has been great concern
over whether the athletes would feel shorted out of the competition
for fewer places. Still we find great support among our sportsmen
for forming one team from one country,'' he said.
   Weiskopf said it was not yet clear how the team would be
selected and funded. He also said the international sport governing
bodies would need to decide how a single German team would be
represented in qualifying competitions for world and Olympic events.
   Separate teams representing both the National Olympic Committees
have already participated in qualifying events in some sports.
   These events determine the rank and seeding for teams in major
competitions such as the World Championships in individual sports
and the Olympic Games.
   Both Olympic Committee presidents also said they support the
choice of Berlin as site of the Olympics in 2000.
   ``The city of Berlin should be accepted by the International
Olympic Committee for athletic and humanitarian reasons,'' said
Daume.
   The groups, with active participation by athletes, will develop
plans for the formation of a team for the 1992 Olympic Games in
Albertville, France and Barcelona, Spain.
   East Germany won 127 medals at the Olympic games in 1988, and
West Germany won 48. Together, a united German team would have won
175, 14 medals more than first-place Soviet Union.
   In the Tokyo Games in 1964, the single German team competed
under the Olympic flag, with the Olympic anthem.
   ``It is the place for sports to lead in this direction. It is a
great step towards peace,'' Weiskopf said.

<HEAD>Documents Said To Show Spying on Poland's Non-Communist Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry began a review
Wednesday of documents that purportedly show its secret police
spied on Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government as it took
power from the Communists.
   The documents were presented by the conservative, anti-Soviet
political party Confederation for an Independent Poland, known by
its Polish initials KPN. The papers are said to describe activity
by the security services under Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak,
who remained in the new government as a Communist holdover.
   Dated from August and September 1989 _ Mazowiecki was elected on
Aug. 24 and the East bloc's first non-communist government was
seated on Sept. 12 _ the reports analyze the activities of Lech
Walesa, potential splits in Solidarity, and debates by former
Communist-linked parties that joined the new coalition.
   Krzysztof Krol, a KPN leader, on Tuesday made public some of the
documents he said were passed to him by an unidentified informer.
He said the originals were in his possession and would be handed
over to the Justice Ministry.
   Spokesman Wojciech Garstka of the Interior Ministry went to KPN
offices Wednesday and took notes on the documents. He expressed
skepticism about their authenticity but reserved further comment.
   Krol said the papers ``prove that the security service under
Gen. Kiszczak, at least with the knowledge of President Jaruzelski,
spied on the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.''
   Kiszczak was one of four Communists who remained in Mazowiecki's
government. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party first
secretary who imposed martial law in 1981, was given the presidency
in July largely to smooth relations with the Soviet Union.
   The transitional concessions to the Communists resulted from
historic negotiations that ended the party's 45-year grip on power.
At the time, Poland was the only country that had gone so far.
   But as reform swept Eastern Europe, the continued presence of
former Communists in the government became a source of controversy.
Walesa, leader of the Solidarity union, and many Poles have
agitated for their removal.
   The documents are addressed to Jaruzelski, Kiszczak and a senior
Interior Ministry deputy, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza daily.
   Mazowiecki will go before parliament Friday to unveil a shakeup
in his government, struggling to surmount an avalanche of criticism
from farmers and Walesa.
   This was disclosed Wednesday by Solidarity parliamentary leader
Bronislaw Geremek at a meeting of his caucus.
   Government spokesmen declined information on what changes were
under consideration.
   The shock economic reform program embarked on by Mazowiecki and
his deputy prime minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, has prompted harsh
protests from various hard-hit sectors.
   Among those protesting the loudest are Poland's 2.5 million
private farmers. Roman Bartoszcze, leader of the Polish Peasant
Party which competes with other groups to represent rural
interests, suggested Tuesday that his party's four ministers quit
the government.
   Walesa wants Mazowiecki to replace holdover Communists in the
government, hold early parliamentary and presidential elections and
speed privatization of state enterprises.
   The government also is grappling with a major rail strike.
   Walesa is widely believed to be gearing up to run for president
to replace Jaruzelski.

   Record temperatures in the 90s and 100s made it a hot Fourth of
July in sections of the Midwest and the East. Showers and
thunderstorms fell over much of the country Wednesday.
   Hot weather has baked the central part of the country this week.
   By afternoon, the heat index combining temperature and humidity
was 110 to 120 degrees across Missouri, 105 to 115 in Tennessee and
105 to 110 in Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Temperatures were 100 degrees or higher from northeast Oklahoma
to southeast Nebraska and northwest Missouri. Readings were in the
mid- to upper 90s across much of Indiana, the 90s across southern
New England, central New York and Lower Michigan.
   It was also hot _ and often humid _ in much of Iowa, Kansas,
Arkansas and northern Texas.
   The mercury hit 97 degrees in Erie, Pa., breaking the record for
the date of 93 set in 1911. Records were broken in Syracuse, N.Y.
(95 degrees, 94, 1955), and Alpena, Mich. (93, 88, 1988).
   Record-tying readings were reported in Baltimore (100 degrees,
1966); Cleveland (98, 1949); Detroit (97, 1949); Lambert Field at
St. Louis (101, 1936); South Bend, Ind. (96, 1946).
   There were showers and thunderstorms in northeast New York,
northern Vermont and northern New Hampshire, and from the upper
Texas coast to northwest Florida and the Georgia coast.
   Thunderstorms and showers also fell in Lower Michigan, central
and southwest Minnesota, southern South Dakota, northwest Iowa and
northern Nebraska. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over
southern New Mexico, southeast Arizona, Colorado and northwest
Wyoming.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 31 degrees in
West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Great Falls, Mont., to 107 degrees in Wichita, Kan.

<HEAD>Thatcher, Mandela Agree to Disagree on Sanctions, Armed Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Nelson
Mandela agreed they can do business together, even though their
first meeting Wednesday failed to resolve differences over
sanctions and the use of violence.
   Mrs. Thatcher welcomed the black South African leader, just
three years after she denounced his African National Congress as a
terrorist organization and said she would have nothing to do with
it.
   ``They had a very good exchange. They agreed to keep in touch,''
said a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules. ``The objective of establishing a personal
relationship and rapport was fully achieved.''
   Mandela, in an unusual description of the British leader whose
toughness has earned her the reputation of ``the iron lady,''
called Mrs. Thatcher ``warm and gentle.''
   The ANC's deputy president said he came away ``full of hope and
strength'' from their three-hour meeting at the prime minister's
residence at No. 10 Downing Street.
   Picking up on Mrs. Thatcher's well-known phrase that she could
``do business'' with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a reporter
asked Mandela if he felt he could do business with her.
   ``Oh yes, I'm doing business with her now,'' he replied. ``We
made progress ... We will keep in close contact.''
   Unlike the other leaders on Mandela's world tour, Mrs. Thatcher
openly opposes sanctions and wants those imposed by the European
Community relaxed as a reward for South African President F.W. de
Klerk's reform program.
   Like President Bush, Mrs. Thatcher also wants the ANC to
renounce its armed struggle against the white minority government.
   Mandela has insisted that the sanctions remain in place for now
to keep pressure on the South African government to dismantle the
apartheid system. He also has said the ANC cannot renounce the
armed struggle until blacks are guaranteed their political rights.
   Mandela had earlier expressed hope that his meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher would narrow their differences on these two issues. But in
the end they apparently agreed to disagree without debating the
issues extensively.
   Asked about the ANC's armed struggle, Mandela said, ``We don't
believe in force as a means of solving problems. If we resorted to
force it's because we had no other option except to use force to
defend our people.''
   Mandela said the ANC is ``now mobilizing the country around
peace,'' but could not rule out resorting to violence if existing
conditions in South Africa do not change.
   Mrs. Thatcher's spokesman said the prime minister and Mandela
agreed on the main issue of getting rid of apartheid and focused on
``the broader issue of the way ahead ... including the changes in
apartheid laws, the economy and the importance of flexibility.''
   Before the midday meeting, 300 anti-apartheid demonstrators
rallied at the end of Downing Street and chanted as Mandela's
limousine went through the gates blocking off the street.
   Mandela's two-day visit to Britain ended the European and North
American legs of his 14-nation world tour. Before flying to Zambia,
he said his meetings had surpassed expectations.
   ``Our message for the maintenance of sanctions has succeeded
beyond our wildest dreams,'' he said. ``Our appeal for resources
has been equally successful, in some respects again beyond our
expectations.''
   At his Wednesday morning meeting with leaders of the
Confederation of British Industry, Mandela said he viewed
nationalization as the method for redistributing South Africa's
wealth to reduce the disparity in living standards between blacks
and whites. But he added he was open to other options.
   On the economic issues, Mandela said his views and Mrs.
Thatcher's ``were not altogether identical.'' The prime minister's
spokesman said she opposed nationalization.
   British investment accounts for 50 percent of the total foreign
investment in South Africa and two-way trade in 1989 was worth just
over $3.2 billion.

   The Kremlin has lifted its 10-week ban on rail
deliveries of key foodstuffs to Lithuania, the last remaining
economic sanction imposed to stop the republic's independence
drive, Lithuanian officials said Wednesday.
   The shipments should resume within two or three days, depending
on the availability of rail cars, said Gintaras Yatkonis of the
Lithuanian Council of Ministers' information center.
   On Tuesday, natural gas flowed back into the Baltic republic,
according to Arune Kontaugaite of the parliament's information
bureau.
   Oil shipments resumed Saturday, one day after the Lithuanian
parliament agreed to freeze its March 11 declaration of
independence. Its lawmakers agreed to the 100-day freeze so that
negotiations on independence with Moscow can begin. The freeze will
start once talks begin.
   Yatkonis said a telegram from the Soviet Transport Ministry
addressed to Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene arrived late
Tuesday, advising that the ban on railroad deliveries had been
lifted.
   The ban was imposed to prevent Lithuanians from making private
arrangements to receive sugar, coffee, fish, tea and citrus fruit
from other parts of the Soviet Union and abroad.
   Yatkonis said the Council of Ministers has ordered that cargo be
unloaded as quickly as possible so that the trains can return for
new loads.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut off all shipments of
oil, most supplies of natural gas and other key items to Lithuania
on April 18 after the republic refused to rescind its
pro-independence laws. Lithuania's 3.8 million residents depend on
the Soviet Union for their energy supplies.
   About 50,000 of Lithuania's estimated 1.1 million workers lost
their jobs because of the shortages.
   Lithuania now is receiving 15 million cubic meters of gas a day,
somewhat less than the normal level of 18.5 million cubic meters,
Ms. Kontaugaite said. Lithuania's sole oil refinery was also
working at less than full capacity.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said 7.6 million gallons of
diesel fuel, 1.7 million gallons of gasoline and 44 million gallons
of lubricating oil were being sent by rail and pipeline to
Lithuania from the Russian and Byelorussian republics.
   The Lithuanian crisis came up at the Communist Party Congress in
Moscow when Lithuanian party leaders still loyal to the Kremlin
addressed the delegates to thunderous applause Wednesday.
   One Lithuanian party leader, Vladislav Shved, cautioned that
what happened in Lithuania _ including the party split _ could
easily happen elsewhere.
   ``Who's next?'' he asked, wondering aloud if this would be the
last national Communist Party congress.
   ``We can't allow adventurists and neo-Stalinists to lord it over
people,'' he said, referring to Lithuanian election victories by
the pro-independence grass-roots movement Sajudis. He also partly
blamed the party leadership in Moscow for allowing the situation in
Lithuania to get out of hand.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 after being independent since World War I.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis as telling Lithuanian Radio on Tuesday that
``long talks about talks'' will be needed before negotiations with
the Kremlin begin.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzkhov said the talks should be held
at the prime-ministerial level.

<HEAD>East Germany Sets Dec. 2 as Date for All-German Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Germanys took another step toward full
unification Wednesday when East Germany's cabinet voted to set Dec.
2 as the date for elections to an all-German parliament.
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler made the announcement late
Wednesday afternoon at a news conference in East Berlin.
   The East German Parliament is expected to approve the date and
West Germany's governing coalition has also said it was prepared
for all-German elections on Dec. 2.
   The announcement came as East German workers, concerned that
unification would lead to high unemployment, held a series of
warning strikes and West Germany's economics minister cautioned
labor unions against unreasonable demands.
   An unspecified number of workers held strikes at at least four
metalwork plants in northern East Germany, the state-run ADN news
agency reported.
   Government sources in East Berlin said Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere will insist on separate elections in East Germany and West
Germany.
   That coincides with West German proposals to have German
elections on the same day, but separate balloting in the East and
West.
   The issue has become important because under West German law
parties must receive 5 percent of the vote to have representation
in Parliament.
   There is no such cut-off in East Germany, and parties fear their
chances would be reduced if they had to compete throughout East
Germany and West Germany.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said if the 5
percent rule applied but East Germany and West Germany held
separate elections, a party in West Germany would need 2 million
votes for representation while an East German party would need only
575,000 votes.
   There are about 40 million eligible voters in West Germany, and
approximately 12 million eligible voters in East Germany.
   He said separate elections would most likely be held and
immediately after the polls closed East Germany would declare
itself unified with West Germany under the West German constitution.
   Schaeuble, in a Wednesday interview with Deutschlandfunk radio,
said any other arrangement would mean East German parties that have
merged with their West German counterparts would not have a fair
chance at gaining seats in an all-German parliament.
   On Friday, Schaeuble and East German Parliament State Secretary
Guenther Krause are scheduled to begin talks in East Berlin on a
second state treaty on the constitutional and legal aspects of
unification.
   The two countries merged their economies and social systems on
Sunday in the first major step toward unification.
   About 30,000 workers held brief warning strikes Monday, the
first day East Germany went to work under a capitalistic system
after 40 years of rigid socialism.
   Experts have predicted up to one-third of East Germany's 8,000
businesses could fold and as many as half its 8 million workers
could lose their jobs under pressure from West Germany competition.
   East Germany's industrial base is antiquated and
labor-intensive. Foreign capital has been slow in arriving.

   Teacher unionists from Czechoslovakia and South
Africa greeted U.S. teachers on the Fourth of July with a plea for
help in planting the seeds of democratic education in their
countries.
   Czechoslovakia is ``an atomized society whose traditional social
ties are destroyed, a society believing in no values, a society
that does not trust its teachers, politicians or priests,'' said
Jan Urban, a former philosophy teacher driven from his post in 1977
for human rights activities but eventually rising to a leadership
role in Czechoslovakia's revolution.
   Addressing the American Federation of Teachers annual convention
being held here this week, Urban added: ``We need education for
democracy.''
   ``We have to face the hardships of a market economy that we know
nothing of. What we need most is teacher training,'' Urban later
told reporters.
   Several hours of the AFT general session Wednesday was dedicated
to the spread of freedom in Eastern Europe and elsewhere in the
last several years. The union detailed its activities in those
nations in helping budding teacher unions and lending technical
assistance to educators.
   Curtis Nkondo, a South African union leader and former teacher
repeatedly jailed for anti-apartheid activities, raised a clenched
right fist and told 3,200 cheering AFT delegates: ``Education in
our country is so that blacks should remain hewers of wood and
carriers of water forever.''
   Some 60 foreign teacher delegates attended the AFT convention,
marking the 744,000-member union's 75th anniversary.
   At a separate workshop on the AFT's international activities on
Tuesday, representatives from half a dozen East bloc countries
called on U.S. educators to come to their classrooms and help them
understand and teach democratic values.
   They also asked delegates to send any old texts, printing
machines or other supplies they could spare.
   ``We all have nothing. Everything you can send will be used,''
said Jaroslav Kalous, chairman of the School Committee of Civic
Forum, one of the groups instrumental in bringing about free
elections in Czechoslovakia last year.
   The challenge educators in Czechoslovakia and other fledgling
democracies face in rebuilding trust in schools and other social
institutions is as daunting as the revolutions themselves, Urban
said.
   ``Teachers, once the pride of my country ... assumed the role of
pitiful, if not hated servants of a hated ideology, which was
incorporated into any subject they taught,'' he said.
   ``Before last year, much of the education in those countries was
controlled politically through the communist states. Educators now
find themselves with the daunting task of transforming those
schools, the curricula, the way democracy is taught,'' said Eric
Chenoweth, an official of AFT's Education for
Democracy-International project, which has been sending technical
aid to those schools.
   AFT President Albert Shanker said in an interview earlier this
week: ``I think the whole celebration of the end of the cold war is
especially important to the AFT. A lot of educational organizations
over the years took the view that, well, democracy is just one form
of government, and we would be ethnocentric to tout our system as
the best. We did not take that view.''
   But ``it is not the intention of our union to go over there and
say, this is the American model, and that's it, no ifs or buts,''
insisted Chenoweth.
   The AFT has already helped support free teacher unions in Poland
and Hungary.
   It is developing special texts and curricula explaining the
concept of democracy. One is now being written by Diane Ravitch, an
educational historian at Columbia Teachers College.
   The union also is trying to get its members to arrange
classroom-to-classroom and school-to-school exchanges so that
Eastern Europeans can learn U.S. educational concepts, and American
kids can learn about the political upheavals in those countries.
   Such classroom-to-classroom projects already have led to letter
exchanges between students in Poland and Anchorage, Alaska, McLean,
Va., and Albuquerque, N.M., AFT officials said.
   Many teachers in formerly communist countries have grown to
mistrust unions, said Zoltan Pokorni, of the new Hungarian
Democratic Teachers Union.
   ``We need to learn how to get new members, how to organize
collective bargaining, how to set up a democratic union
structure,'' he said.
   Pokorni added, however, that East Bloc nations have no desire to
simply copy U.S. labor and education customs with no regard to
their countries' histories and traditions.

<HEAD>Rostock Revokes Honorary Citizen Title Awarded Hitler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSTOCK, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials said Wednesday they
had revoked an honorary citizen title awarded to Nazi dictator
Adolf Hitler in 1933, the East German news agency ADN reported.
   A city committee also canceled the honorary citizen title of
Friedrich Hildebrandt, Rostock's former Nazi Gauleiter, the
district administrative chief of Mecklenburg in northern East
Germany, ADN said.
   A city council member, Christoph Krummacher, told ADN, ``It is
grotesque and shameful that it took 45 years after the war to
strike the honorary titles of Nazi representatives.''
   Also revoked were the honorary titles of former ousted Communist
Party bureaucrats, ADN said.
   It said that following the city's first democratic elections in
May, the new city council appointed a committee to investigate
Rostock's list of honorary citizens ``in the spirit of law and
order.''
   The honor first went to Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht
von Bluecher, for his role in defeating Napoleon's main army near
the Rhine River in early 1814 and eventually conquering Paris.

   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Wednesday Iran and Iraq have moved closer to peace following direct
talks between their foreign ministers aimed at a formal ending to
almost 10 years of hostilities.
   Speaking in an interview with the official Islamic Republic News
Agency and state-run Tehran Radio, Rafsanjani said: ``What is clear
to me is that we are now closer to peace compared to two months
ago.''
   ``The confidence of the two countries in the fact that the other
side desires peace has become relatively greater,'' Rafsanjani
added without elaboration.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar mediated the
Tuesday meeting in Geneva between the foreign ministers of Iran and
Iraq, Ali Akbar Velayati and Tariq Aziz.
   It was the first face-to-face encounter between Velayati and
Aziz since peace negotiations were launched in August 1988, a few
days after a U.N.-mediated cease-fire halted the eight-year Persian
Gulf War.
   Although Velayati and Aziz were present in the four rounds of
peace talks held since 1988, the two men did not speak directly to
each other, instead relaying their comments through Perez de
Cuellar.
   The earlier negotiations stalled almost immediately over the
question of priorities. Iran insisted on an Iraqi withdrawal from
territories occupied in the last weeks of the war.
   Iraq insisted that Iran agree first to the dredging of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway of war debris. The waterway marks the
southern border of the two nations.
   The common border ran down the middle of the channel before the
war but Iraq has demanded full sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab,
its main outlet to the gulf.
   Before leaving Geneva Wednesday, Velayati told reporters he was
optimstic that the talks would move ahead.
   ``During the meeting we found out that Iraq and Iran, both of
them, now are more flexible than in the past,'' he said without
elaborating.
   Perez de Cuellar, who in previous talks relayed statements
between the two ministers, said Tuesday's meeting was a
``psychological breakthrough'' though nothing substantive was
discussed.

   In bold, daytime operations, thieves cut two
paintings from their frames at two Paris museums on Wednesday, one
a Renoir stolen from the Louvre, officials said.
   Both paintings, Renoir's ``Portrait of a Seated Woman'' and
Hebert's ``Portrait of Monaluccia,'' were small format paintings.
Such paintings are often chosen by thieves because they can be
easily concealed.
   The theft of the Renoir, which had been hanging in the Louvre's
third-floor Pavillon de Flore gallery, was discovered about 2:15
p.m., officials said. The Hebert was discovered missing from the
Ernest Hebert Museum, across the Seine River on the Left Bank,
about an hour later. Officials said both paintings were stolen
during the day, presumably after the museums had opened.
   Officials noted that in both cases the paintings had been cut
from their frames, but could not immediately say whether the thefts
were related.
   Both museums are run by the Directory of French Museums, a
government agency.
   ``Portrait of a Seated Woman,'' painted between 1916-1918,
measures 13.5 by 10.5 inches. Hebert's work, painted around 1870,
measures 14} by 12} inches.
   A catalogue of stolen paintings, recently published by the
Interior Ministry, shows that small format paintings are the most
common targets.
   The catalogue also shows that 58 percent of the paintings stolen
from French museums between 1979 and 1989 were taken from the
stocks. About 40 percent of the stolen paintings had been on
display.
   The last Paris museum theft that occurred during the day was
Oct. 27, 1985, when a gang of armed thieves held up the Marmottan
Museum, stealing a number of impressionist works, including Claude
Monet's ``Impression Sunrise,'' which inspired the name for the
impressionist movement.
   The painting has not been recovered.

   First came the West German mark,
then the Whopper.
   The first Burger King fast food restaurant in East Germany
opened its doors Wednesday, treating East Germans to ``original
hamburgers, American apple-pastries and the world-famous
`Whopper,''' according to the East German news agency ADN.
   The fast food outlet, near the main Dresden train station, is
co-run by the East German company, Mitropa, ADN said.
   Burger King and Mitropa plan to open restaurants throughout East
Germany, especially at train stations and on the autobahns, Burger
King European vice-president John M. Rollo said, according to ADN.
   ADN described the Whopper sandwich, cornerstone of the fast food
restaurant, as a ``grilled beaf steak, originally garnished, served
in a sesame roll.''
   East Germans paid for their meals with the new mark, which since
Sunday has circulated in both Germanys as part of the economic
unification of the two countries.
   The news agency carried no other details.

   Two people were killed and nearly
200 arrested after street celebrations turned violent following
Argentina's 4-3 victory over Italy in World Cup soccer, police said
Wednesday.
   A gang of young men beat a 54-year-old man to death after he
refused to hand over an Argentine flag he was waving, police said.
The incident occurred in Florencio Varela, 18 miles south of Buenos
Aires.
   In a western suburb of Buenos Aires, a 22-year-old man was
fatally struck by what appeared to be a stray bullet as he
celebrated the victory.
   In Buenos Aires, thousands of fans took to the streets Tuesday
night to celebrate the defending champion's advance to the World
Cup finals.
   The celebrating turned chaotic when several hundred youths began
looting shops. Police fired tear gas at the rioters, who responded
with stones and bottles.
   Police said nearly 200 youths were arrested, and 165 remained in
jail Wednesday facing charges of robbery, resisting arrest and
disturbing the peace.
   Business returned to usual Wednesday morning.
   Argentina faces West Germany in the World Cup final Sunday.

   Albanian authorities agreed to meet
Wednesday with a representative of foreign embassies sheltering
more than 200 asylum-seekers who have issued one of the biggest
rebuffs to 45 years of orthodox Communist rule.
   In Vienna, an Albanian diplomat said on condition of anonymity
that all foreign embassies in Tirana, the Albaninan capital, were
assured anyone wishing to leave would receive a passport. He
indicated there would be no reprisals.
   Last week, a few Albanians hoping to leave their impoverished,
isolated country of 3.2 million sought political asylum at
embassies. Word of their success apparently spread by word of
mouth, and on Monday, their numbers swelled. Truckloads crashed
through embassy gates or clambered over walls.
   Some Albanians were injured in their desperate attempt to gain
entry. At least three were shot and wounded by agents of the feared
secret police, diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
   In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the West German
Embassy in Tirana had received ``reports that the Albanian guards
carried away bodies which didn't move. We don't know if they were
dead or not.'' The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the reports, which came from people who said they witnessed
the scene, could not be confirmed by the embassy.
   The Albanian government, led by Ramiz Alia, also said people
were wounded, but gave no figures. It described the asylum-seekers
as either criminals or deluded adolescents, in a dispatch from ATA,
the Albanian state agency.
   Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, said 214 Albanians
who want to leave the country have taken refuge in about a dozen
foreign diplomatic missions in Tirana.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press in
Ankara, the Turkish ambassador in Tirana, Teoman Surenkok, gave the
total number of refuge-seekers as 243.
   The unrest is the latest sign that the people are frustrated by
Albania's refusal to follow other Eastern European countries in
adopting democratic reforms.
   Albanian officials arranged to meet with Yugoslav Ambassador
Novak Pribicevic, who was empowered to represent all foreign
missions harboring Albanians, according to Austria's APA news
agency.
   In addition, Tanjug cited unidentified Albanian sources as
saying the Communist Party Central Committee planned an emergency
meeting shortly.
   Foreign ambassadors accredited to Tirana agreed to jointly seek
a solution to the plight of Albanians in their embassies.
   Hanns Schumacher, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn, said
Albanian authorities refused on Wednesday to grant landing
permission for a cargo plane carrying relief goods for the West
German Embassy, where 86 Albanians sought refuge. He said Bonn
would pursue the matter Thursday.
   In Warsaw, a Foreign Ministry official said 41 Albanians sought
refuge in the Polish Embassy. Andrzej Barzyk said Poland ``under no
circumstances'' would hand the refugees back to Albanian
authorities ``if there are no guarantees their rights are to be
respected.''
   Other embassies echoed those sentiments.
   Cuba reportedly ejected some Albanians, and in an apparent
protest, a bomb was thrown at the Cuban Embassy late Tuesday,
causing damage but no injuries.
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said Albanian authorities pledged
to issue passports to the four men holed up in Budapest's embassy.
But a ministry spokesman said the four refused to leave the embassy.
   The East German news agency ADN said similar guarantees had been
given to other embassies where Albanians sought refuge.
   Most of the 30 Albanians in Tirana's Turkish Embassy left the
mission after being promised exit papers, diplomats said.
   The Albanian refugee flight recalled a similar situation last
year when East Germans seeking safe passage to the West filled
embassies in other East European states. The move helped fuel the
peaceful revolution that toppled Communist rule in East Germany.
   The situation in Albania indicated authorities may have done too
little too late to ease restrictions.
   Under reforms begun in May, starting Tuesday, Albanians who
previously were not allowed to travel freely are entitled to
passports; a ban on religion has been lifted, as has the death
penalty for defectors; and modest economic retooling has been
promised.
   The country has also expressed interest in broadening ties with
other nations.
   But the Communist monopoly on power continues. The leadership
has firmly rejected the political plurality now practiced in all
former Soviet satellite nations.
   Foreign governments have protested that shots were fired at
their missions' doorsteps, and European Community officials
discussed the Albanian situation in Brussels, Belgium.
   Italy's foreign minister asked the United Nations to act on what
he said was Albania's violations of international law and human
rights.
   Bulgaria expressed ``astonishment'' over the arrest of one
would-be asylum seeker within its embassy compound.
   West Germany protested the ``brutal behavior'' of Albanian
guards who fired on people trying to enter the embassies.
   Turkey's Surenkok said large crowds gathered briefly outside the
embassy to applaud asylum-seekers. He said asylum-seekers
complained about lack of political freedom and the rigid economy.

   Mayor Art Agnos has ordered police to break
up a sprawling encampment of homeless people just outside City
Hall, substituting a resettlement program critics call insufficient.
   Agnos' order, which takes effect Friday, directs police to begin
enforcing laws against sleeping in public places.
   The mayor, an unabashed liberal Democrat, tolerated the
encampment of as many as 350 people for two years because he said
there was no workable alternative.
   This week, the city took over operation of two shelters intended
to provide comprehensive services such as alcohol detoxification
and job counseling to the homeless. City officials say the plan is
a new approach of offering a ``port of re-entry'' to society.
   Advocates for the homeless charge that the two service shelters
are insufficient and understaffed, and won't solve the city's
housing problem. They say the Agnos program will reshuffle the
homeless by forcing out 215 people staying in a private shelter
taken over by the city.
   They said the new policy will break up couples and force many
people into jails, doorways or alleys.
   ``What's going to happen Friday night is San Francisco will
start criminalizing homelessness,'' said Josh Brandon of the
Coalition on Homelessness.
   ``The city tells you there are 329 beds in our (new) system.
What they neglect to tell you is 215 are already full,'' Brandon
said.
   Only men will receive beds in the new multiservice shelters
during the first few weeks of the program. Women will continue to
be placed in existing housing programs until beds are added to the
new shelters by mid- to late summer.
   Some women say they shun the existing programs because they
involve placement in seedy, unsafe hotels or have too many
restrictions.
   Cristina Jaskula, who has been living outside City Hall since
February, says she and her husband would rather remain ``free''
than be separated in order to have shelter.
   ``A shelter is like being in prison,'' said Jaskula, 42.
``There's no freedom of movement.''
   In the past two years, the number of homeless people in the
tree-shaded Civic Center park has grown into the hundreds. It has
been dubbed ``Camp Agnos'' by some of its residents and critics,
including city employees who used to have lunch in the park but
have been driven away by the shabbiness and human waste.
   Most campers have packed up their tents, blankets and other
belongings since the eviction order, which told them to report to
an intake office on Polk Street. Prior to the holiday Wednesday, 82
people had reported, and 64 men were sent to a new shelter nine
blocks from the Civic Center.
   One shelter, which opened Monday night, accommodates 110 men and
will add 90 beds for women by August, officials said.
   The 215 men at the shelter the city took over will be
``transitioned'' out to make way for new occupants, including
women, said Judy Schutzman, the city's co-director of the centers.
Ten beds are to be added next month, she said.
   City officials say the transition means finding housing for the
men. Advocates for the homeless are doubtful.
   Food Not Bombs, a group that feeds the homeless, plans to stage
an all-night protest outside Agnos' home Friday night _ bringing
homeless people to the mayor's doorstep.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania and Bulgaria on Wednesday
moved to resolve an ecological dispute that has long soured
relations between them.
   Prime ministers Petre Roman of Romania and Andrei Lukanov of
Bulgaria agreed at a meeting to set up a joint commission that will
work toward ``diminishing and stopping the pollution caused by the
Giurgiu Chemical Plant and the Bulgarian nuclear facility near the
border.''
   The two sides undertook to provide each other with exact data on
the disputed facilities within 20 days and to complete a convention
for protecting the environment along their border before August.
   They said world experts will be asked ``to assess the degree of
pollution at the frontier and the measures necessary for removing
the pollution.''
   The agreement was announced in a communique released after the
meeting.
   Thousands of Bulgarians demonstrated along the frontier last
month demanding closure of the Giurgiu plant.
   Romanians in turn accused the Bulgarians of having insufficient
safety standards at their nearby nuclear plant.
   About 500 Bulgarians kept up a protest on their side of the
border for the third day Wednesday, and at 6 p.m. blocked
Romania-bound traffic for two hours.
   Romania's House of Deputies meanwhile approved Roman's liberal
program of ``radical reform'' on Wednesday with only 12 of its 296
members opposed.
   President Ion Iliescu approved the program Tuesday.
   In a televised Fourth of July address, U.S. Ambassador Alan
Green, Jr. warned the Romanian government that ``expressions of
adherence to democratic ideas are not enough.''
   ``Democracy is not established by rhetoric or good intentions
alone. These must be accompanied by concrete steps to secure the
conrnerstones of freedom ... A democratic government ... encourages
peaceful dissent, it guarantees freedom of expression.''
   Washington has criticized last month's government action in
suppressing a 53-day opposition rally in central Bucharest,
especially the use of miners from outside Bucharest to track down
and beat opposition students and intellectuals.

   Japan's NEC Corp. on Wednesday unveiling what it
called the world's fastest general-purpose computer, saying it has
moved ahead of its U.S. and Japanese rivals.
   The company said its new ACOS System 3800 computers were
designed for maximum speed and memory-processing capacity.
   The top of the line, the model 60, is capable of speeds of up to
500 million instructions per second and can store up to 128
trillion bits of data _ the equivalent of about 200,000 years of a
typical English-language newspaper, NEC said.
   Last month, Japan's Hitachi Ltd. announced its M-880 series of
mainframe computers, with a maximum speed of 155 million
instructions per second, which it said was then the fastest in the
world. IBM's top model has a speed of 122 million instructions per
second, it said.
   The Hitachi computers are compatible with IBM machines, while
NEC's mainframes are not, making direct comparisons difficult.
   But the new NEC computers appeared to put the company
significantly ahead of its rivals in the competition for top speed.
   IBM, the world's largest maker of computers, is reportedly
developing a new mainframe computer expected to debut next year.
   General-purpose mainframe computers are intended for varied
office and business use, while supercomputers are designed
specifically for scientific calculations and therefore can operate
more rapidly.
   NEC's executive vice president, Yukio Mizuno, said the System
3800 computers are designed to handle large data bases for one or
more companies.
   ``Up until now, large mainframes generally served a single
company, but increasingly they are being used to create networks
between several companies, such as a manufacturer and its
wholesalers,'' he said.
   Seven versions of the computers are available, ranging from one
to six processors, the company said. A processor is the ``brain''
of a computer, and several processors give a machine an ability to
process information more rapidly.
   Monthly lease fees range from $330,000 to $1.9 million, NEC
said. It said it plans to sell about 200 systems over the next five
years.

   A Canadian tanker loaded with oil ran
aground and punctured its hull Wednesday between the Detroit River
and Lake Erie, but a U.S. Coast Guard officer said no fuel spilled.
   The 330-foot tanker Nancy Gauchier, carrying 4,300 tons of oil,
lost power while passing through the Livingstone Channel and ran
onto rocks, said Petty Officer Steve Attaway.
   The tanker has a double hull, as required by Canadian law. The
inner hull wasn't punctured, so there was no release of oil,
Attaway said.
   The ship regained power and was anchored six miles out in Lake
Erie while officials assessed the damage. Attaway said he was
unsure how big the hole was.
   The Canadian Coast Guard decided the vessel should remain where
it is until weather improves.
   ``At that point, she will proceed with a tug escort through
Canadian waters to Port Colborne for offloading and survey by
Canadian Coast Guard,'' Attaway said.
   The channel is south of Windsor, which is just across the
Detroit River from Detroit, and runs from the lake to the river.
It's on the Canadian side of the lake and river border.
   The ship, owned by Socanav Inc. of Montreal, was headed from
Sarnia to Port Colborne.

   Tourism Minister Olivier Stirn resigned Wednesday
following criticism over a political meeting he organized in which
people were paid to fill up a roomful of empty seats.
   The office of Socialist Premier Michel Rocard announced the
resignation in the late evening, just hours after Stirn told French
TV news that he would not step down.
   The brief statement said Stirn was resigning at his own request
and that Minister for Foreign Trade Jean-Marie Rausch would take
over the tourism duties.
   Stirn, in his own statement later, said he was a victim of the
``political game'' and media pressure. He attributed the incident
to a ``small error by an entourage without bad intentions.''
   ``I am and remain a faithful servant of the state,'' he said.
   The French media disclosed Tuesday night, at the end of a
two-day symposium addressed by several government ministers, that
several hundred people had been hired to fill up an empty house.
   Stirn, who sponsored the symposium entitled ``Headquarters for
Progress,'' admitted that was the case but said the hiring was done
without his knowledge by overzealous party members.
   ``About 50 unemployed were paid,'' he said. ``I think it is
regrettable, but we should not get dramatic about it.''
   Numerous government ministers and opposition members said Stirn
should resign to avoid disgracing all politicians. Some called the
incident ``scandalous'' and ``revolting.''
   The symposium opened Monday morning to a roomful of 37 people,
including participants, journalists and photographers. By
afternoon, only about 20 people were present, according to press
reports, a situation repeated Tuesday morning.
   But by mid-afternoon, however, the house was suddenly full.
People applauded vigorously during speeches by Socialist Party
First Secretary Pierre Mauroy, former Premier Laurent Fabius and
others.
   But the house emptied when Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement rose to speak, reporters at the symposium said. It was
subsequently revealed that the audience's three-hour contract
expired at 6:15 p.m., just as the defense minister began his speech.
   Stirn later conceded that two party members, embarrassed by the
lack of attendance, had contracted without his knowledge with two
agencies which furnish people for crowd events.
   The incident was disclosed accidentally after a cameraman was
approached by a person leaving the meeting, asking for his envelope
of 300 francs, or $55, French TV reported.

   Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen killed three
Arab guerrillas after they spotted them outside the buffer zone
north of Israel's border with Lebanon, the army said Wednesday.
   The South Lebanon Army militiamen opened fire on a group of
guerrillas near the town of Jazzin Tuesday night after a mine
exploded in the area, the army said.
   The militia searched the area of the shooting after daylight
Wednesday and discovered three bodies of guerrillas, the army
reported.
   The milita sustained no casualties, the military said.
   Army radio said the guerrillas were believed to be members of
the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. That
faction is led by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The incident occurred just north of Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone.
   The 2,500-member South Lebanon Army patrols the zone with the
aid of more than 1,000 Israeli troops. The 2-to-10-mile wide strip
was set up by Israel after it withdrew the bulk of its invasion
force from Lebanon in 1985.

   A NASA rocket scientist and
alleged Nazi war criminal who wants to return to the United States
joined a congressman at a news conference Wednesday just a
half-mile over the U.S. border.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said Arthur Rudolph, who played a
major role in designing and building the rocket that took Americans
to the moon, passed a lie-detector test in which he denied any
involvement in Nazi war crimes.
   Traficant said Rudolph, who voluntarily left the United States
in 1984 in a deal with the U.S. government, deserves a hearing on
his request to return.
   ``Arthur Rudolph without question answered truthfully to all of
these questions,'' Traficant told the news conference in a hotel.
``Had Dr. Rudolph failed, I would not be here today.''
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which
has investigated alleged Nazi war criminals living in the United
States, has ``run roughshod over this particular fellow,''
Traficant said.
   ``If all of their cases, once analyzed, look like this case and
some others that are into focus, then there should be an
investigation into the Office of Special Investigations.''
   Traficant has also defended John Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland
auto worker on death row in Israel who was convicted of Nazi
atrocities. The congressman has sharply criticized the OSI for
trying to discredit some witnesses in the Demjanjuk case.
   The OSI accused Rudolph of working thousands of slave laborers
to death building Nazi V-2 missiles during World War II.
   After the war, the U.S. Army brought into this country Rudolph
and more than 100 other members of the Wernher von Braun rocket
team. Rudolph became chief coordinator for the Saturn V rocket,
supervising its planning, design, testing and production for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   But in 1984, facing what the OSI said was evidence of his
involvement in war crimes, Rudolph voluntarily renounced the U.S.
citizenship he had been granted, admitted his complicity in war
crimes and left the country in a deal that let him keep his NASA
pension.
   Now 84, Rudolph sat beside Traficant as the congressman said the
scientist was coerced into the agreement and wants to return to the
United States because he does not want to be remembered as a war
criminal.
   ``Dr. Rudolph has decided that history and how they'll record
his name may be more important than the hassles which he'll
undertake,'' Traficant said.
   Rudolph, blinking under camera flashes and television lights,
refused to address the media, saying, ``I've been advised by my
attorney not to answer any questions.''
   Rudolph has signed a document authorizing the OSI to turn over
any evidence of his involvement in war crimes to Traficant, the
congressman said.
   ``Under the waiver of the Privacy Act, I will expect to be
receiving from OSI all of its so-called sealed evidence,''
Traficant said.
   OSI head Neal M. Sher said in 1984 that Rudolph, while chief
operations director for German V-2 missile production, participated
in the persecution of forced laborers, of whom as many as 20,000
are estimated to have died.
   Sher has described Rudolph, who said he belonged to the Nazi
party, as a self-confessed war criminal. But Traficant claims an
Army investigation absolved Rudolph of war crimes in 1947.
   On Tuesday, Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said the
department still considers valid the agreement Rudolph signed in
1984.
   But Rudolph claims that not only did he not persecute any
laborers, he was an advocate for those suffering.
   After leaving the United States, Rudolph went to West Germany,
where a government attempt to prosecute him for war crimes failed
to turn up enough evidence.
   Rudolph arrived in Canada on Sunday and faces an immigration
hearing in Toronto on Friday to determine if he can stay.
   Asked about reports Rudolph might try to enter the United States
illegally, Traficant said Rudolph ``is not going to be breaking any
laws.''

   The government is looking for a few good men
and women to help clean up radioactive contamination at its nuclear
weapons plants over the next 30 years.
   The job is challenging, with plenty of time outdoors. And
officials guarantee a career for just about any college science
student.
   The Department of Energy said it will take 50 percent more money
and twice as many people as previously estimated to carry out a
five-year cleanup plan at the waste sites.
   ``We've got to convince the people in the colleges to go and
look at this as the career of the future... It's an exciting
career, an interesting career, one that is involved with new
technology,'' said Leo Duffy, head of DOE's cleanup office.
   He said there are at least 20,000 job openings over the next 30
years in the field and an annual budget in billions of dollars.
   He said the department intends to do a better job of publicizing
the benefits of working as an environmental scientist, seeking
better ways to contain and dispose of radioactive waste.
   ``Environmentally, they are going to be out there in the wide
open spaces of the West... the sage brush, the rabbits and the elk
and the antelope,'' he said.
   In a typical day, he said, a scientist would ``go to work in the
morning in a jeep pulling a boat... go fishing for awhile, picking
up samples of fish, trapping some animals and taking them back to
the laboratory.''
   As the department tries to lure workers into the field, Duffy
said it will face the same image problems it faces every day.
   ``Technology does not always interest every man and woman,'' he
said. ``Distrust in Department of Energy past practices is a
problem. The fact you've got radioactivity is a major problem,''
   Duffy said the lack of scientists and adequate technology are
the biggest hurdles to cleaning up weapons plants that have dumped
high-level radioactivity into the soil and water.
   ``We've got a problem,'' he said. ``We have a major program
initiated for fiscal year 1990 of approximately $2.6 billion... and
we don't have the capability...to support it.''
   The government now estimates cleanup costs for 1991-1995 will be
$28.6 billion, nearly 50 percent more than the $19.5 billion
projected last fall.
   The General Accounting Office predicts costs will total $150
billion to $200 billion over the life of the 30-year project.
   ``The worst thing we can do is go out and throw money at this
program and wind up with a scandal in three years that will damage
both the department's credibility and the ability to clean up our
sites,'' Duffy said.
   In addition to recruiting and training workers, Duffy said the
DOE has to do a better job of persuading private entrepreneurs to
get into the business.
   The department said the fear of being sued is deterring
businesses from getting involved in the cleanup.
   ``Anybody who makes a mistake in those kind of areas is betting
on their company,'' Duffy said. ``When we are talking about the
kind of money to clean up an individual site _ anywhere from $1
billion to $25 billion _ there are not too many companies in the
United States that are willing to bet their assets on that.''

<HEAD>Priest Arrested for Child Pornography</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old priest has been charged with taking
pornographic pictures of children in the town in central France
where he served for 42 years, court and church officials said
Wednesday.
   The British-born priest, Nicolas Glencross, was charged Saturday
by a Paris judge with inciting minors into lewd behavior. He has
been jailed pending further court proceedings.
   The charges were confirmed Wednesday by Glencross' superior,
Roman Catholic Bishop Michel Moutel.
   ``Priests are men, with their weaknesses and their limits,''
Moutel said. ``It's proper that they can be called to account for
their acts.''
   Glencross was charged with taking photographs of children,
mostly boys, for use in pornographic publications which were
uncovered by Paris police, court officials said.
   Glencross was arrested eight days ago in the Loire Valley town
of Saint-Leger-des-Vignes, where he had been a priest since 1948.
He was brought to Paris for questioning before formally charges
were issued Saturday.
   According to news reports, Glencross was well-known in the town
for his paintings and drawings of children, some of which were
shown in exhibitions. He customarily asked to take photographs of
the children before commencing the portraits, townspeople said.

   Teachers must face facts on how badly U.S. schools
are performing and work harder to persuade administrators to
embrace reform, teacher union leader Albert Shanker said Wednesday.
   ``Most of our members don't believe this. It isn't my school
that's bad, it's that big city down the road,'' Shanker said in his
keynote address at the American Federation of Teachers annual
convention.
   ``We ought to look at the facts,'' he said. ``We shouldn't be
the ones making believe that nothing's wrong.''
   He cited statistics showing that 95 percent of Japanese high
school graduates do math as well as the top 5 percent of U.S.
students.
   And he urged teachers to get the reform ball rolling by helping
create at least one school per district that looks genuinely
different from those operating today.
   ``Let's have schools in which teachers do very little talking,
where kids are doing the work, where they can do it over different
periods of time, where they can work either privately or in groups.
And let's put as much technology in schools as we can,'' Shanker
said.
   Too often, schools have tried one of these reform ideas, but not
most or all of them, Shanker said.
   While exhorting the 3,200 teacher delegates to go back home and
level with the public about how serious the education crisis is,
Shanker renewed his attacks on school administrators for failing to
respond to union reform initiatives.
   ``I'm very disappointed because we're out there alone. I don't
sense very much enthusiasm on the part of management,'' he said in
an hourlong address.
   The 744,000-member AFT's four-day annual gathering concludes
Thursday. The 2 million-member National Education Association will
hold its annual convention Thursday through Sunday.
   Among the day's other events, AFT delegates approved a union
boycott of the Japanese automakers Nissan, Honda and Isuzu for
allegedly resisting unionization in its U.S. plants.
   And Shanker, 61, was elected unopposed to a ninth two-year term
as AFT president.
   Union favorite Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., also addressed
AFT delegates, and won frequent applause for blasts at President
Bush for failing to fund education reforms.
   ``If the administration has its way, and we keep on
short-changing reform, the next generation of students won't even
be able to read their president's lips,'' he said.

<HEAD>Capitol Pledges Legal Help to Retailers Over Explicit Warning
Labels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitol Records promised to provide legal
help to store operators threatened with arrest for selling its
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit
lyrics.
   ``The music industry has proven its willingness to address the
issue of explicit material through our use of voluntary, uniform
stickers,'' Capitol President Hale Milgrim said in a statement
released Tuesday.
   ``However, it is becoming evident that other forces see
stickering as an excuse to censor artists,'' Milgrim said. ``This
is intolerable and a violation of the First Amendment.''
   Milgrim said some retailers are afraid to order recordings with
the stickers. To allay those fears, Capitol will provide lawyers
for anyone threatened with harassment or arrest for selling its
labeled recordings, he said.
   Capitol said it will serve notice of that promise with a label
of a different kind: ``Retailers: Capitol records vehemently
opposes censorship of artistic expression and will assist in the
defense of any attempt to stop the legitimate sale of this
LP-CD-cassette.''
   ``We feel that an artist has the right to express his or her
distinctive viewpoints through music and that retailers should be
able to make this music available to the public without the fear of
being arrested or harassed,'' Milgrim said.
   The first Capitol records carrying the voluntary industry label
and the retailer notification label will be released in August.
They are releases by C.P.O. and King Tee as well as the ``Return of
Superfly'' soundtrack.

<HEAD>Bomb Damages Offices of Anti-Apartheid Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb damaged the offices of
an anti-apartheid newspaper Wednesday, a day after right-wing
extremists claimed responsibility for recent attacks against whites
wanting to end segregation.
   The pre-dawn explosion at the empty offices of the
Afrikaans-language newspaper Vrye Weekblad was the fifth attack in
as many nights against whites opposed to apartheid.
   The bomb caused only minor damage. No one has been hurt in any
of the explosions, all in Johannesburg.
   A man claiming to belong to a right-wing extremist group, the
White Wolves, said his organization was responsible for the recent
blasts. He made the claim in a phone call Tuesday to The Citizen, a
pro-government newspaper.
   The editor of Vrye Weekblad, Max du Preez, said an unidentified
caller phoned him at home Wednesday morning and warned that the
attack was ''only a beginning.''
   The attacks on the four preceding nights were at the office and
the home of one anti-apartheid city council member, at the home of
another city council member and at a synagogue.
   The synagogue was covered with graffiti comparing Jews to the
African National Congress, the country's leading black opposition
group. A number of Jews are active in anti-apartheid groups.
   The caller to The Citizen newspaper said all the places attacked
were considered part of ''the same target.''
   The Johannesburg City Council said security had been tightened
at the homes of all 51 council members. The council is controlled
by the anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
   The White Wolves have claimed responsibilty for several attacks
in the past two years. Police say they have not been able to
determine if such an organization actually exists, or if white
extremists acting independently have simply adopted the name.
   President F.W. de Klerk's reforms and stated intention of ending
apartheid have outraged right-wing whites, who have vowed to resist
any lessening of white privilege.
   Both de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela have warned that
heavily armed right-wing whites could undermine black-white efforts
to negotiate a new constitution and end apartheid.
   In another development, a member of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party said the party would defy a new law requiring
public facilities be open to all races.
   Parliament last month repealed the law permitting the
segregation of libraries, swimming pools and other facilities, and
local municipalities have until Oct. 15 to comply.
   But Pikkie Coetzee, a member of Parliament, said the facilities
won't be integrated in the dozens of towns where the Conservatives
control local councils.
   ``People are going to hate each other, and there could be
conflict,'' Coetzee told The Star newspaper of Johannesburg. ''If
hundreds of blacks arrive (to use facilities), there just won't be
space.''
   The Conservatives, the official opposition in the white chamber
of Parliament, oppose violence and have distanced themselves from
the recent bomb attacks.
   Most right-wing whites are Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers of South Africa who account for about 3 million of the 5
million whites.
   Under the country's apartheid system, whites maintain political
and economic control. The 28 million blacks have no voice in
national affairs.

   Three national veterans groups
sounded a call to arms at an Independence Day rally, urging the
country's 27 million vets to unite behind a petition drive for
better health benefits.
   ``We've had all we can stand. The system is underfunded and
we're not going to take it anymore,'' said Larry Rivers, executive
director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which has 3 million
members nationwide.
   The VFW joined the Paralyzed Veterans of America and AMVETS in
calling the rally in Williams Park, which drew at least 2,000
veterans from across the state, many in uniform and bedecked with
campaign ribbons.
   The masters of ceremony were Adrian Cronauer and Chris Noel,
whose radio voices reached hundreds of thousands of American troops
in Vietnam. Cronauer was portrayed by Robin Williams in the movie
``Good Morning Vietnam.''
   Vendors sold hot dogs and popcorn, red, white and blue balloons
danced in the breeze, and the vets wore American flags in their
lapels or breast pockets.
   Under the theme ``united again,'' a petition was launched urging
the Bush administration and congressional leaders to stop cuts in
veterans' benefits.
   Veterans' leaders say the $12.4 billion budget being discussed
for veterans' health care is insufficient to keep pace with
inflation.
   Without another $1 billion, the country's 172 Veterans Affairs
medical centers will be unable to provide in 1991 the level of care
offered in 1988, said R. Jack Powell, executive director of the
Paralyzed Veterans, which has 14,000 members.
   ``Veterans were there for the country when America needed
them,'' Powell said. ``The question today is whether the country
will be there for them in terms of health care.''
   Mall shoppers can buy eyeglasses in an hour, Powell said, but
veterans at the VA often must wait three months. A veteran can wait
eight months or more for a hip replacement operation, he added, and
six months to be admitted to a cardiac-care unit.
   ``You tell a veteran you're going to provide cardiac care _ but
in six months _ and he's at risk of a heart attack within an
hour,'' said Powell, who retired from the Army in 1971 after a land
mine in Vietnam left him paralyzed.
   Owen Ball, a 70-year-old World War II veteran and a member of
the rally's honor guard, said he has unsuccessfully fought the VA
for years to get a hearing aid. He lost part of his hearing in a
bomb explosion in London in 1944.
   As veterans, like the rest of the population, age, the need for
health care grows more acute, Powell said.
   ``If something isn't done about it, the country is going to end
up with an increased burden on Medicaid and other indigent,
non-compensated care,'' he said, noting that budget squeezes have
closed clinics at VA hospitals and left an estimated 3,500 beds
unused because of staff shortages.
   The groups chose Florida for the rally because it has a veteran
population of 1.5 million, with thousands more moving in yearly. It
also has a large active-duty military population and four, soon to
be five, VA hospitals.

   Jubilant West Berliners flocked to the city's
main Kurfuerstendamm boulevard Wednesday night, launching fireworks
and shouting ``Germany! Germany!'' to celebrate West Germany's
reaching the World Cup soccer finals.
   West Germany won, 4-3, in a penalty-kick victory over England at
Turin, Italy, and will meet Argentina on Sunday in the finals.
   In Turin, police used truncheons to disperse unruly crowds near
that city's main train station after the game. A 23-year-old German
was stabbed in the back and badly hurt when a fight broke out among
rowdy fans before the kickoff.
   British Embassy spokeswoman Kay Coombs said in Turin there was a
brief scuffle involving about 40 English, Italian and German fans
in a park near the railway station and that when police dispersed
the people, they found the wounded German and one Englishman with a
head injury, who refused treatment.
   After the game, police used clubs and kicked people as they
sought to scatter large groups gathered at street corners near the
station. The crowd set off firecrackers, provoking more clashes.
   Hundreds of police in riot gear positioned themselves on streets
to keep the crowd under control.
   Shortly after midnight, minor clashes occurred between police
and crowds gathered outside the station. English fans were not
involved, police said, although there was some friction between
German and Italian fans.
   By 1 a.m. Thursday, most of the crowd had dispersed.
   Throughout West Germany, people rushed into the streets, honking
horns, lighting fireworks, waving flags and cheering the soccer
victory, which put West Germany into the World Cup finals for the
third straight time.
   A caravan of cars filled with fans waving German flags drove up
and down West Berlin streets to the cheers of spectators. Some
pounded on car roofs.
   Traffic on ritzy Kurfuerstendamm was at a standstill.
   Germans drove through the streets in Frankfurt and Bonn, as
well, honking horns. In downtown Frankfurt, fans hung out of
windows shouting ``Deutschland wunderbar!''
   ``It's a super day for Germany,'' said Michael Hindel, a
30-year-old truck driver from West Berlin. ``It was a fantastic
match, and we played extremely well. I'm certain we can win it all
in the finals.''
   ``It's all very exciting,'' said Manfred Solleder, a 45-year-old
businessman from West Berlin. ``We were lucky to win, but I think
it was a good thing, especially now during the mood of
reunification. It will be a nice thing for the East Germans to have
a winning team to identify with.''
   The two Germanys merged their economies Sunday in a prelude to
full unification, expected in December.
   Martina Schmidt, a 19-year-old student from East Berlin, said a
shot at winning the World Cup and German unification in the same
year was ``almost too unreal to believe.''
   ``What more could you ask?'' she said.

<HEAD>Colombian Terrorists Blow Up Three Medellin Police Posts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrorists apparently working for the
Medellin cocaine cartel blew up three police posts and shot one
officer to death, police said Wednesday.
   So far this year, 159 police have been killed in Medellin, the
country's second largest city and the focus of the government's
10-month-old war on drugs.
   Medellin Police Chief Col. Jorge Ferrero said national police
are sending 500 more officers to the city.
   In recent weeks, the police force has been doubled to around
5,000 members.
   No casualties occurred Tuesday when the three police posts were
blown up, a Medellin police communique said. It said each of the
three bombs contained about seven pounds of dynamite..
   Young, motorcycle-riding assassins on Tuesday shot an off-duty
policeman 12 times as he walking unarmed to his house, the
statement said.
   Two other policemen were wounded Tuesday night when gunmen
attacked the residence of Mayor J. Mario Rodriguez of Envigado, a
Medellin suburb long considered the headquarters of the Medellin
drug cartel.
   The police statement said the mayor was not harmed.
   Drug traffickers and police are at war in Medellin, Colombia's
second largest city with 3 million people.
   On April 2, the Medellin drug cartel offered $4,300 for every
law officer killed.
   Police blame drug traffickers for exploding five car bombs this
year, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds.
   Army Gen. Harold Bedoya, commander of the 4th Brigade, at a news
conference last week reiterated authorities' offer to pay $400,000
for information leading to the arrest of Pablo Escobar, reputed
head of the Medellin cartel and the man believed responsible for
the violence sweeping the city of 3 million.

   Striking banana workers softened
their salary demands slightly Wednesday as talks continued for the
fifth day with U.S. banana giant Chiquita.
   Labor unrest continued to spread in this Central American
country.
   Police used hacksaws to cut through chains on the doors of post
offices to remove postal workers from offices they had occupied on
Tuesday. But mail service remained halted Wednesday.
   Water and electricity workers threatened to go on strike.
   Some 10,000 Chiquita workers began their strike on June 25.
Since then, another 11,000 workers in other industries have gone on
strike in support of the banana workers.
   Four thousand health workers have been on strike since June 11
to protest the government's decision to privatize food, security
and cleaning services at 19 public hospitals. Army medics have been
called in to assist at some hospitals.
   Negotiations continued in an effort to end the strike against
Chiquita Brands International Inc. Bananas are Honduras' leading
export and the Cincinnati-based Chiquita, formerly United Brands,
is one of the most powerful institutions in Honduras.
   Carlos Aragon, Chiquita's labor relations superintendent, said
the workers were now seeking a 50 percent pay raise, retroactive to
March 1990.
   The workers, who earn an average of $15.32 a day, had been
demanding a 60 percent pay starting in July.
   ``We are making an effort to reach a satisfactory agreement but
a rapid solution to the problem is not yet in sight,'' said Aragon,
contacted by telephone in San Pedro Sula, 125 miles north of
Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   ``The economic aspect is basic in this matter ... and it will
take us more time to resolve it,'' he said.
   In another development, private sector organizations issued a
statement saying strikes by government employees were hurting the
econony. They said there have been 13 strikes by government workers
_ seven of them in May _ so far this year, costing a total of $3.8
million.
   ``This chaotic situation provokes uncertainty and increases the
risk for investment in Honduras,'' the statement said.

   Forty environmentalists wearing badger masks
turned up outside the House of Commons on Wednesday in support of a
parliamentary bill which seeks to outlaw any interference with
badgers' burrows.
   Hunting the animals for sport is on the increase in the British
countryside, said the lobbyists, members of the Royal Society for
Nature Conservation. Hunters dig badgers out of their burrows and
then set dogs to attack and kill the animals.
   The conservation society and other animal rights supporters have
condemned the activity as a barbarous cruelty and a threat to the
survival of the species.
   The parliamentary bill is sponsored by legislator Tony Banks of
the opposition Labor Party. It is what is known as a private
member's bill, meaning that the government, which writes the bulk
of the legislation that passes through Parliament, is not involved
in its progress.
   Private members' bills frequently fail to become law, getting
squeezed out of the parliamentary timetable because of the crush of
other business.

   A judge sentenced a defense contractor to
three years in prison and fined him $750,000 for faking quality
tests on engine bolts used in thousands of military and commercial
aircraft.
   ``This is a very egregious case motivated primarily by greed and
avarice,'' U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said Tuesday in
sentencing Norman D. McHaffie, 56, former president of McHaffie
Inc. of Sylmar.
   ``The actions of McHaffie literally weakened and endangered the
national defense,'' Tashima said.
   No accidents were attributed to McHaffie bolts.
   The bolts were used in the Air Force B-1B strategic bomber, the
Navy-Marine Corps F-18 Hornet fighter-attack aircraft, the Navy-Air
Force A-7 Corsair II jet attack fighter, the Navy F-14 Tomcat
fighter and the Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon.
   They also were used in thousands of Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. commercial jets, the government said.
   Jack Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said executives
at the world's largest manufacturer of jetliners cooperated in the
government investigation.
   ``We did quality checks on every (McHaffie-tested) bolt we had,
and we had no bad bolts,'' Gamble said.
   Tashima also sentenced McHaffie's quality control supervisor,
James Hicks, 45, of Sepulveda to 18 months in prison for
participating in the scheme to submit false test certifications to
the government.
   A shop floor manager, William Whitham, 37, of Lancaster, was
previously sentenced to 20 weekends in prison.
   McHaffie pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy and two counts of
submitting false test certifications to the Department of Defense.
The other men also admitted wrongdoing.
   Prosecutors contended that McHaffie saved more than $1.5 million
by failing to properly test some 9 million bolts between 1979 and
1989.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen A. Mansfield said it was the
longest-running fraud against the government by a defense
contractor uncovered so far.
   McHaffie told Hicks and Whitman to create fake test data and
fabricate reports to conceal the fraud, according to a federal
complaint filed March 29.
   The government alleged bolts sent to General Electric Co.'s
engine division failed testing by an outside laboratory.
   The discovery that many of the company's bolts failed to meet
testing requirements also led to a massive effort to discard them
from parts suppliers, prosecutors said.
   General Electric alone spent at least $4 million to test a
sample of bolts, the government said.
   McHaffie shut down in June 1989 and sold off its assets.

<HEAD>France Explodes Nuclear Device; New Zealand Issues Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France on Wednesday exploded a nuclear device at
its South Pacific test site, the Defense Ministry said. The nuclear
test drew an immediate protest from New Zealand
   It was the fourth such test announced since May, when President
Francois Mitterrand promised during a visit to Polynesia to make
them public. In the past, France had refused to confirm or deny
reports of nuclear tests, despite protests from Pacific nations
over its policy.
   The Defense Ministry said the latest test at the Mururoa atoll
yielded less than 35 kilotons. New Zealand's Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research in Wellington said the test
measured approximately 20 kilotons.
   New Zealand's prime minister, Geoffrey Palmer. immediately
issued a statement expressing his disappointment at the test and
its timing. He said it offers further evidence that France cares
little for the protests of South Pacific nations.
   ``It is particularly insensitive that they should be testing
now, a matter of days before'' a group of leaders from South
Pacific nations meet in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, he
said.
   Palmer said he was also disappointed that the test should come a
day after France had announced it would be an observer at the
Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.
   ``We saw this as a positive signal that France shared the
concern of treaty members, including New Zealand, on the horizontal
proliferation of nuclear weapons technology to more countries,''
Palmer said.
   ``But now we see that France is continuing to ignore opposition
to vertical proliferation _ the acquisition of more and improved
weapons by existing nuclear weapons states.''
   Palmer said France knew that by continuing to use the South
Pacific to perfect its nuclear weapons, it was acting in a manner
completely unacceptable to New Zealand and other countries in the
region.
   Since changing its policy on announcing the tests, France has
said it exploded nuclear devices on June 2, June 7 and June 26 at
Mururoa.

   Officials plan to begin buying land for
the superconducting super collider project on Friday.
   The Texas National Research Laboratory Commission has scheduled
a noon ceremony near this town about 30 miles south of Dallas to
buy its first parcel for the giant particle smasher.
   ``It's going to be a major milestone in this project,'' said Ed
Bingler, executive director of the commission. Neither the
landowner nor the price were disclosed.
   Officials will have to acquire more than 10,000 acres to build
the super collider, a 54-mile oval in a tunnel in which protons and
other particles will be accelerated to extreme speeds and smashed
for scientific study.
   Subsurface rights will be purchased for another 6,400 acres.
   The commission is buying the property and the rights, but
ownership will be transferred to the federal government. It is
estimated that land acquisition will cost $40 million to $100
million.
   The $8 billion super collider is expected to be in operation in
the late 1990s.

<HEAD>Director of Canadian AIDS Group Says He Helped Eight Commit
Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of an AIDS
support group says he's helped eight AIDS sufferers commit suicide
by providing them with large doses of prescription drugs.
   ``I've been at the bedside of more than 100 people at the moment
of their death. Eight of those people I've helped,'' said David
Lewis, 38, who also is being treated for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Lewis, a director of the Vancouver Persons With AIDS Society,
said he obtained prescription drugs and put enough for a fatal
overdose within reach of the patients, who usually are bedridden.
   ``I think it's immoral and unethical to not help someone die if
that's what they want,'' he said Tuesday.
   Lewis said he wouldn't help people commit suicide over nothing
more than emotional despondency, but maintained that people nearing
death and in pain from AIDS face different circumstances.
   ``I've not pushed pills down anybody's throat,'' he said, ``but
I've certainly complied with people's desires.''
   It is a crime in Canada to counsel or assist a suicide. Some
people have been tried for such acts in the United States but there
is no record of a conviction in Canada.
   Lewis said he received legal advice that he would not be
convicted if he withheld the names of the eight people.
   ``There's nothing really that we can do about that without some
disclosure of who the victims were,'' Vancouver police Constable
Bob Cooper said Wednesday. ``We would have to prove Mr. X committed
suicide and that he was assisted in doing so by Mr. Y.''
   Cooper said police weren't about to start an investigation based
on a newspaper interview but planned to meet with prosecutors for a
general discussion of euthanasia.
   British Columbia Solicitor General Russ Fraser deferred
questions Wednesday to provincial Attorney General Bud Smith.
``I'll check with him myself,'' Fraser said.
   Phillip Scarisbrick, a Vancouver lawyer speaking for the
Canadian Bar Association, said Lewis could face criminal charges.
   ``If this fellow flaunts his activities enough, they'd be forced
to prosecute him,'' Scarisbrick added.
   However, Brian Greenspan of Toronto, president of the Ontario
Criminal Lawyers' Association and vice chairman of the Canadian Bar
Association's criminal justice section, said Lewis might not be
liable under the law.
   ``I'm really not sure if he's committed an offense,'' Greenspan
said.
   He explained that to obtain a conviction, prosecutors would have
to prove that Lewis helped someone commit suicide rather than
merely provided an opportunity to commit suicide.
   Prosecutors also can exercise discretion in deciding whether to
file charges, he added.
   ``It's not a black-and-white issue as to whether you prosecute
or don't,'' Greenspan said.
   Euthanasia for AIDS patients is ``a political hot potato,''
however, so authorities might be reluctant to act, Scarisbrick said.
   Canadian law ``turns a blind eye to certain behavior,'' said
professor Earl Winkler, who teaches ethics at the University of
British Columbia.
   ``I think people like David Lewis have a lot of courage,'' he
said.
   Lewis said he knows some people oppose to his activities, ``but
I suspect those are people who are not themselves with a terminal
illness.''

<HEAD>Kohl Says Size of United German Military a Subject for Vienna
Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl is ready to
have the size of a united German military negotiated at ongoing
conventional arms reduction talks in Vienna, his chief spokesman
said Wednesday.
   The West German leader and the heads of the 15 other North
Atlantic Treaty Organization members gather in London Thursday and
Friday to discuss the future role of the Western alliance in a
rapidly changing Europe.
   Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said the West German chancellor
considered discussions on a united Germany's military strength to
be among the highest priorities of the Vienna arms talks.
   As the two Germanys rush toward unification, Moscow has raised
concerns over such issues as the size of a united German army, the
military alignment of a unified Germany and what to do with the
approximately 380,000 Soviet troops now in East Germany.
   Klein did not mention any possible limit on the size of a united
Germany's armed forces.
   News reports over the weekend said the Defense Ministry wanted
to halve East Germany's military and limit the total strength of a
combined German military to no more than 400,000.
   East Germany has about 100,000 soldiers; West Germany about
495,000. However, West Germany has already said it plans to reduce
its total troop strength to 400,000 in five to six years.
   Klein said Kohl would also re-emphasize at the NATO summit his
commitment to full membership for a united Germany in the Western
alliance, which the Soviets have so far rejected.
   He will also support a greater role for the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has been pressing for a
formal role for the 35-nation conference in European security
matters, with regular meetings of leaders of the member countries.
   The Soviets have proposed the conference serve in the future as
an umbrella security organization in place of NATO and the
crumbling Warsaw Pact. The United States has opposed the idea.

<TEXT>
   A $15.1 million judgment has been entered
against former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos in a Washington
state case in which she and her late husband were found liable in
the murders of two anti-Marcos activists.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted Monday with Saudi financier Adnan
Khashoggi of federal racketeering and fraud charges that she helped
loot her homeland's treasury of $222 million and spent it on art
and real estate, much of it in New York.
   The $15.1 million judgment, entered June 19 in a federal court
in New York and June 27 in a state court here, clears the way for
the slain men's families to attach Marcos property in New York. The
judgments were published in the New York Law Journal on Tuesday.
   On Dec. 15, a civil jury in a federal court in Seattle found
Marcos, the late deposed president of the Philippines, and Mrs.
Marcos liable in the 1981 murders of the two Filipino activists.
   Marcos' estate and his widow were ordered to pay more than $15
million to the survivors of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes. The
jury awarded Domingo's wife and two young daughters $12.8 million,
and Viernes' wife $2.3 million.
   Richard Hibey, lead attorney for the Marcoses, blamed the
verdict on the couple's unpopularity and said he would appeal,
which could delay payment of the award for years.
   The jury decided that the Marcoses were conspirators in the
deaths of the two men and were negligent in failing to control
their intelligence agents in the United States.
   Domingo and Viernes, both 29 and leaders of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union, were slain in the union's Seattle office on June 1,
1981, four weeks after they successfully sponsored a resolution
calling for an investigation of anti-union activity in the
Philippines.
   The case alleged that a Marcos friend in San Francisco used
$15,000 from a corporation he controlled to pay for the murders,
and that the Marcoses had a network in the United States to
monitor, harass and intimidate their opponents.
   Three men were convicted in 1981 and 1982 of murdering Domingo
and Viernes, but those trials did not result in a finding that
there was a Marcos-linked conspiracy.
   The Marcoses fled a popular revolt in their homeland in 1986 and
moved to Hawaii. Ferdinand Marcos died there in September before
the racketeering case in which his wife was acquitted went to trial.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday applied for
full membership in the European Economic Community, a move it
believes will help unite war-divided Cyprus.
   ``This is a great day for Cyprus, and we're very proud,''
President George Vassiliou, leader of the east Mediterranean
island's Greek Cypriot majority, told reporters.
   Cyprus, with a population of nearly 700,000, has been associated
with the EC for 17 years. It is the only non-member that has signed
a customs union with the 12-member bloc.
   The island has been cut in two since 1974, when the Turkish army
invaded in the wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern one-third of the island, which was
proclaimed a breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in 1983. Only
Turkey recognizes the Turkish sector.
   Turkey applied for European Community membership in 1987. But
its application has been held up, partly because of the community's
reluctance to admit new members before its scheduled economic
integration in 1992.
   The community is also believed to have reservations because of
alleged human rights violations in Turkey and the Turkish presence
in northern Cyprus.
   Turkey objects to Cyprus seeking membership of the European bloc
without the consent of the Turkish Cypriot minority, who form an
estimated 18 percent of the island's population.
   Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, has threatened to
boycott a new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Vassiliou if
the Greek Cypriots applied for EEC membership.
   The talks on a U.N. proposal for a two-zone federation have been
deadlocked for months.
   Turkey has also rejected U.N. resolutions demanding the
withdrawal of an estimated 30,000 Turkish troops and 50,000
mainland settlers from north Cyprus and the return of 200,000 Greek
Cypriot refugees who fled or were expelled from the north.
   The Turks insist the troops and settles must stay as a security
guarantee. Ankara also rejects the return of Greek Cypriots to
their former homes.

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin is
recovering well a day after doctors operated on him to repair a
broken hip, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Begin, 76, fell in his home Tuesday, breaking his right hip for
the second time.
   Hospital spokeswoman Devorah Weissman said doctors expected
Begin would remain in the hospital for two weeks of physical
therapy and rehabilitation.
   ``Mr. Begin is recuperating well and showing good progress,''
said Weissman, spokeswoman for Jerusalem's Shaarei Tzedek Hospital.
``He's been moved to a private room in the regular orthopedic ward
and he's been up out of bed already.''
   Begin was also hospitalized for two weeks in May with pneumonia.
   Begin served as prime minister from 1977 to 1983, when he
stepped down from office without explanation.
   He took over as prime minister in May 1977 when his Likud bloc
handed the left-leaning Labor Party its first national electoral
defeat in almost 30 years.
   He left office six years later reportedly depressed about the
high casualties the Israeli army was taking in Lebanon as the
result of the June 1982 invasion launched under his leadership and
the death of his wife, Aliza.
   Since resigning, Begin has lived in seclusion, rarely emerging
from his apartment at the edge of the Jerusalem forest. He receives
visits only from a small circle of aides and former colleagues.

   International master Igor Gleck of the
Soviet Union won the 18th annual World Open chess tournament
Wednesday.
   The 28-year-old Muscovite defeated fellow Soviet Vitaly
Tseshkovsky in the final round to score 7{ out of a possible nine
points and gain the $17,870 first prize.
   The competition is billed as the biggest open chess tournament
in the world. This year's event featured 1,158 players battling for
a total purse of $178,688.
   A nine-way tie for second place included three American
grandmasters: Joel Benjamin of New York City, Walter Browne of
Berkeley, Calif., and Larry Christiansen of New York City and
Soviet emigre Alex Yermolinsky of Piscataway, N.J.
   Also tying for second were British grandmaster Julian Hodgson of
London, Ferdinand Hellers of Stockholm, Sweden, and three Soviets:
Naum Rashkovksy of Moscow, Ilya Smirin of Minsk and Alexander
Shabalov of Riga.
   The competition was split into several sections for players of
different rankings.
   The competition, held in Philadelphia since 1985, featured
players from 45 states and 20 countries, said tournament organizer
Bill Goichberg.
   Goichberg said this year's event was missing many top U.S. and
overseas grandmasters because of a scheduling clash with a world
championship qualifying tournament in the Philippines.

   Riot police briefly arrested the six
leaders of a 3-day-old government workers strike Wednesday as the
walkout called by pro-Sandinista unions gained momentum.
   Police had detained the strike leaders at the Sandinista Workers
Center just before they were scheduled to give a news conference.
   Lucio Jimenez, head of the National Workers Front, said he and
five others were arrested for ``disturbing the peace.''
   ``We were freed because of pressure from the public and the
students,'' Jimenez said at the University of Central America
within minutes of his release.
   No comment was immediately available from authorities.
   It was the first time leaders of organized labor were arrested
during the 2-month-old administration of President Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro.
   The arrests came after Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated Sandinista
leader Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 national elections, called the
strike ``strictly political.'' She accused the Sandinista party of
trying to sabotage her efforts to revive the economy.
   ``What every strike, sabotage or anarchy does is to reduce the
good effects of my government's economic policy and the ones who
suffer most are the people,'' she said in a televised message late
Tuesday.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front officially threw its
support behind the strike Wednesday and said it ``is the fruit of
the economic, political and social measures dictated by the
government.''
   The arrested leaders included Lucio Jimenez, secretary general
of the Sandinista Workers Center; Edgardo Garcia, secretary general
of the Sandinistas Farm Workers Association and Jose Angel
Bermudez, secretary general of the National Employees Union.
   Unions called out the nation's 100,000 government workers Monday
to protest what it said were ``massive firings'' since Mrs.
Chamorro took office April 25. The strike at first attracted little
support and only a few thousand workers walked off their jobs.
   Salaries, which were raised 100 percent to settle a May strike
that paralyzed the country, were not an issue.
   The Sandinistas said the strike was also called to protest
government economic policies which they claim ``favor the rich''
and could lead to social unrest.
   The Chamorro administration plans to cut spending by selling
most state-owned industries and trimming the bureaucracy. It also
wants to dismantle 10 years of Sandinista efforts to create a
socialist system in Nicaragua.
   Wednesday hundreds of customs workers walked off their jobs and
joined the strikers. At the Selin Shible customs office in Managua,
about 40 trucks waiting to have their cargo checked went unattended.
   Telecommunications and postal workers stepped up their work
stoppages from one to two hours a day on Wednesday. Union
representative Sonia Ortiz said they would increase ``little by
little the stoppage until we reach total strike.''
   Thousands of employees in government agriculture, construction,
metalworking and textiles were also striking.
   Jose Angel Bermudez, leader of the National Employees' Union,
said walkouts will increase ``because the strike is scaled.''

<TEXT>
   James Karl Allison Jr., director of planning and
development for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., and a former Broadway
producer, died Wednesday in Perugia, Italy. He was 42.
   Allison suffered a cerebral hemorrhage Sunday while in a
Spoleto, Italy hospital visiting a sick member of the festival
orchestra, festival spokesman Tom Kerrigan announced in New York.
Allison was taken to a hospital in Perugia.
   Allison, who was known as Karl, joined the board of directors of
Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., in 1988, and later
took the staff position.
   In January, he put together a benefit at New York's Lincoln
Center that raised $321,000 for the festival in the aftermath of
Hurricane Hugo.
   His credits as a Broadway producer include ``Blithe Spirit''
with Richard Chamberlain and Geraldine Page, ``Wild Honey'' with
Ian McKellan, ``You Can't Take it with You'' with Jason Robards and
Colleen Dewhurst, and ``Aren't We All'' with Rex Harrison. He
produced the long-running off-Broadway hit ``Greater Tuna.''
   Gian Carlo Menotti, who founded the Festival of the Two Worlds
in Spoleto, Italy, and the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., said, ``Karl
Allison was a friend and a colleague whose energy and hard work we
valued deeply. His death is a terrible loss.''
   Funeral services were planned in Charleston, S.C., home of
Allison's parents.

   A general strike on Wednesday brought
Greece to a vitual standstill, with civil servants joining private
employees and shop owners to challenge the conservative
government's austerity and development programs.
   Transport services were disrupted, power supplies were erratic,
traffic was snarled and air pollution was reported at record highs
in this capital city of more than 3 million.
   It was the fourth 24-hour national strike this year.
   A union official estimated strike turnout at about 70 percent
nationwide.
   But the Federation of Greek Industries, which represents the
bulk of private industry, called the strike a ``general failure.''
A spokesman put the strike at private industries at about 5 percent.
   The official and spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Workers are protesting price increases and other measures taken
by Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis following his April 8
election.
   The government is struggling to contain inflation, now running
at 22 percent, and a projected $2 billion deficit. It estimates
each national strike costs the ailing economy $100 million and 16
million work hours.
   The strike was called jointly by the General Confederation of
Greek Workers, the civil servants union and smaller labor
organizations. The unions claim about 2 million members. Protest
rallies were held throughout Greece.
   Parliamentary committees are debating a bill aimed at
stimulating investment.
   Labor leaders say the measure allows for more flexible working
hours, and claim this will do away with the eight-hour working day.
   ``The bill may be voted through Parliament, but we won't allow
it to be implemented,'' confederation president Lambros
Kanellopoulos told an open-air rally in Athens.
   Public Power Corporation and Telecommunication company employees
joined the walkout to protest elimination of privileges granting
them discounts on their electricty and phone bills.
   Their walkout began Monday, resulting in power cuts in parts of
the country.
   Flights on Olympic Airways, the national carrier, were disrupted
by two three-hour walkouts.
   A public transportation standstill forced commuters to miss work
or hitch rides on major thoroughfares.
   Private cars and taxis jammed Athens, raising air pollution
levels.
   PAKOE, an independent environment agency, reported more than 700
people hospitalized because of respiratory problems.

<TEXT>
   A 90-year-old man was a free man
Wednesday after jurors acquitted him of bludgeoning to death three
housemates in a retirement home rampage.
   ``Thank you to the jury and the judge. That's all I want to
say,'' Henry Thomas said as he left the Pasco County courthouse
late Tuesday, cleared of the New Year's Day 1989 slayings.
   One of his attorneys cried as the verdict was read following
five hours of jury deliberations.
   ``It's a great day,'' said Thomas, who had spent the last 18
months in jail.
   He was taken in his wheelchair from the courthouse to the East
Pasco Detention Center and released.
   Two residents died at the scene and a third, left with a
fractured skull, died a month later. Three others recovered from
injuries.
   Defense attorneys had argued there was too much doubt that
Thomas did, or even physically could have, carried out the
beatings. They said three residents of the group home described the
attacker as a young man.
   Police arrested Thomas, his clothes spattered with blood, and
said he had attacked the victims with his heavy oak cane. His cane
had traces of blood and a bone fragment.
   Thomas said he saw and heard intruders and fled out the front
door when they began beating his roommates. He was picked up 12
hours later.
   Despite his age, prosecutors portrayed Thomas as a strong, fit
man, a onetime boxer who got the better of a man 70 years his
junior while in a cell in May. During the jail confrontation,
Thomas had an arm lock on a 20-year-old until a guard broke it up
when he heard the young man call for help.
   Authorities said the retired fruit picker had trouble getting
along with other elderly residents in the Reflections I home that
housed nine people about 45 miles northeast of Tampa. Thomas shared
a 10-foot-by-9 room with two others.
   They said he argued often, becoming angry over such incidents as
when his things were moved by others.
   Assistant Public Defender William Eble, in tears as the verdict
was read, said Thomas would be reunited with his family.
   Members of the Thomas family linked hands to pass through a line
of reporters, continuing to refuse to talk.
   Eble and Assistant Public Defender John Carballo helped Thomas
stand as the verdicts were given.
   As he listened to Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb issue a formal
finding of innocence, Thomas lifted the index finger of his right
hand in a saluting gesture to the judge. Cobb nodded in return.
   The verdicts prompted emotional applause in the courtroom.
   While some celebrated, Charles and Helen Tear struggled with the
outcome. Helen Tear owned the home, and her father-in-law, Frank
Tear Sr., was among those killed.
   ``I was angry at the applause,'' Mrs. Tear said. ``Obviously,
this was like a party.''
   The Tears testified for the prosecution and believe that Thomas
committed the murders.
   ``I turned this over to the Lord a long time ago,'' Charles Tear
said. ``If this is His will, then I accept it.''
   Prosecutor Phil Van Allen had no comment on the verdict.

   A body pulled from the Ohio River on
Wednesday could be the 25th victim of flash floods that ravaged the
area last month, an official said.
   The body was spotted by a pleasure craft about 200 yards south
of the mouth of Wegee Creek and about five miles south of
Shadyside, said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   West Virginia authorities recovered the body about 9 p.m. and
were expected to turn it over to the Belmont County coroner's
office for an autopsy Thursday, Vogt said.
   The body was not identified Wednesday night, he said.
   Vogt said the body probably was one of the missing victims of
the June 14 flood because it was found in an area where a crane had
removed debris.
   About 5{ inches of rain fell near this eastern Ohio village in
three hours on June 14, sending walls of water down Wegee and Pipe
creeks. The bodies of 24 people have been recovered while nine
officially remain missing, pending identification of the body
recovered Wednesday, Vogt said.

going on drinking binges and not wearing seat belts.
   In Wisconsin, 28 percent of respondents said they were

   The government said today it
was temporarily suspending plans to kill 30,000 seals to produce
dog food and aphrodisiacs after protests from environmentalists
around the world.
   Environment Minister Gert Kotze said he was suspending the
culling to study public reaction to plans to kill 25,000 seal cubs
and 5,000 adult male seals on the northwest coast later this month.
   ``This is not backtracking at all, but its fair towards the
public and conservationists to consider their objections, and I
want time to do that,'' Kotze told state-run radio.
   South African and international environmentalists had protested
a Taiwanese business group's plans to kill the seals for export.
Seal bodies would be used for pet food while the males' genitals
are prized as aphrodisiacs.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is drawing unprecedented
attacks from all shades of reds at a turbulent Communist Party
congress, but even his critics say they will vote to keep him in
the top party job.
   ``If we have to vote, I shall vote for Gorbachev, simply because
there is no other alternative,'' said delegate Vitaly G. Karpenko,
echoing a sentiment heard across the spectrum in the Kremlin Palace
of Congresses.
   The 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is expected to
elect the party general secretary before it adjourns sometime next
week, and the smart rubles are riding on Gorbachev, who first won
the job five years ago.
   Hard-liners and radical reformers are gravitating toward
Gorbachev because both sides believe only he can prevent the

   Members of Congress say they want assurances
from the Energy Department that dramatic cost increases in cleaning
up nuclear weapons waste will yield a safer environment, not bigger
profits for contractors.
   The department said Tuesday it will take about 50 percent more
money and twice as many people as earlier projected to clean up
radioactive waste at weapons plants over the next five years.
   ``I think there is support on the (Capitol) Hill for this, but
people are going to start asking what is being cleaned up? What is
being accomplished?'' Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said Tuesday.
   ``I worry about how much of the money is going into the pockets
of the contractors and how much actual cleanup is being done,'' he
said.

   The 101st Congress has nearly all its
important work remaining for its frantic final weeks of legislating
_ with success riding on cooperation with President Bush.
   Deficit reduction, clean air and child care are three big issues
on the agendas of both Bush and the Democratic Congress. To
accomplish them, they'll have to put aside the pattern that
dominated the first 18 months of their relationship.
   Bush has proven a dozen times that he can veto bills and not be
overridden. He's beaten back congressional attempts to expand
federal financing for abortions and loosen restrictions on
politicking by federal employees.
   On the other hand, he can't always get what he wants if the
Democrats don't want to give it to him. He has been denied his
first choice for Secretary of Defense, a cut in the capital gains
tax and an amendment to the Bill of Rights to ban flag burning.
   ``We've been between the 20 yard lines in the 101st,'' said Rep.
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga. ``Nobody's moving across anybody's goal line.''
   That confrontation and stalemate pattern is likely to continue
on the so-called ``values'' issues, such as abortion and possibly
on federal funding of ``indecent'' art.
   Just last week, Bush vetoed legislation to mandate unpaid leave
for workers who need to take care of new babies or sick relatives.
Chances for an override appear slim.
   But the overall relationship between Bush and Congress appears
to be turning. The legislative successes widely expected when Bush,
a former House member, took office could be on the way.
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expect they'll break the
ice on the big, meat-and-potatoes legislating that will mark them
all as failures if it isn't done.
   ``I don't think we've got to enact every single one, but
certainly many of them for this to be fairly characterized as a
successful Congress,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said Bush was well positioned to come out a winner.
``Bush is not just talented, but extremely clever'' politically and
legislatively, he said.
   The biggest problem is time.
   Congress has less than nine working weeks scheduled before its
early October pre-election adjournment, and issues with little
chance of passage, such as campaign finance reform and a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, will eat time.
   Much of the current discussion in Congress hinges on the budget
talks, since money for any new initiatives must be balanced against
the demand for reducing the deficit.
   Discussing the budget and his pledge for cooperation on that
front, Bush lamented last week that if he had a Republican Congress
``we might not even be talking about this today.''
   The comment was a political bone for GOP lawmakers hurt by
Bush's decision to support raising taxes as part of a deficit
reduction plan. Besides losing one of their best issues,
Republicans were angry at Bush's close cooperation with the
Democrats.
   In addition to the budget, Bush will be under pressure to accept
the Democratic Congress' bills on child care, rights for the
disabled, tougher standards for oil tankers, farm programs and
crime.
   The administration is negotiating with Congress on those issues
prior to final passage in an effort to get bills that Bush won't
feel compelled to veto. He's already struck a compromise with the
Senate on a major new housing bill.
   All of those bills fall in the category of what one top House
Democrat called Bush's ``I'm for that, too'' approach to politics.
   But Mitchell complained in an interview that in the case of the
oil tanker bill, Bush has been ``a major obstacle to action.'' The
House and Senate passed different versions of the legislation last
year but a final resolution has been held up.
   Mitchell said he's willing to force confrontation on that and
other issues unless the president gets on board.
   ``I think we have set the agenda, and ... ultimately he will not
be able to prevent the Congress from establishing a good record in
this session,'' said Mitchell, who is in his first term as Senate
leader and eager to prove himself.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., reminded the Democrats last
week that cooperation from Bush wasn't enough.
   ``Now comes the really hard part: Getting down to specific
spending and revenue proposals,'' Dole said of the budget summit.
   He viewed the football field a little differently. ``We are now
on the 20 yard line, only 80 yards left to go.''

<TEXT>
   Businesses, not individuals, are becoming the
victims of choice in the thriving crime of telephone fraud,
industry experts believe.
   Phone fraud accounts for $500 million in losses, or about 1
percent of the $50 billion in revenues earned by long distance
carriers annually, says the Communications Fraud Control
Association, a McLean, Va.-based group.
   Traditionally, long distance ripoffs consisted mainly of calling
card fraud _ mostly unauthorized use of individuals' or businesses'
carrier-issued calling card billing numbers. Other phone service
thieves used so-called ``black boxes'' that emit a tone to allow
access to long distance lines.
   But individual calling card fraud is being taken over rapidly by
another scam _ one that victimizes business telephone systems
called private branch exchanges or PBXs.
   ``Abusers are now going after the more vulnerable PBXs and are
having a field day,'' said Rami Abuhamdeh, whose association is
financed by telephone companies and law enforcement agencies.
   PBX scams target a feature on the phone system that allows
company employees to dial into the home office _ usually on an 800
or WATS line _ from outside. Then, after punching in a personal
identification number, they get a second dial tone and can make
calls as if they were sitting at their desk.
   Calls made using this feature, called reorigination, allow the
company to save the additional charges that long distance carriers
assess for calling card use.
   To get the 3-to-4 digit security codes, computer ``hackers'' use
programs on their own personal computers. Equipped with a telephone
modem they can automatically dial numbers sequentially until they
hit upon the right combination to access an outgoing line.
   A hacker can even start the program before he goes to bed and by
the time he wakes up in the morning, he'll have hacked out the code
number, said Bob Fox of United Telecom@US Sprint.
   Abuhamdeh claims that thieves are targetting PBXs in part
because larger long distance companies have beefed up their
security against calling card fraud.
   Access codes also have been sold by disgruntled employees at
some companies.
   According to Fox, calling card fraud at US Sprint is down to
insignificant numbers. But for businesses victimized by PBX fraud,
losses can be staggering.
   Fox said $30,000 to $40,000 in extra charges are not unusual.
   Abuhamdeh said New York City's Human Resources Administration
lost $700,000 in two months after someone inside the agency sold
codes to outsiders.
   Among the most innovative attempts at eliminating remote access
fraud is a device developed by US Sprint that can recognize the
precise voice pattern of a legitimate customer.
   The customer, after registering his voice pattern with the long
distance carrier, simply says his identification number into the
phone and the voice recognition device verifies the user's identity.
   ``It applies to both long distance comanies and PBX users. The
technology is at point right now where it's changing every day and
becoming better,'' Abuhamdeh said.
   Companies can take immediate steps to fight against PBX fraud by
increasing remote access code numbers to as many digits as the
system allows and not using numbers in sequential order, Fox says.
   Fox also recommends that companies turn off the reorigination
feature of a PBX during hours when it is not normally used and
review remote access records as frequently as possible.
   Voice recognition systems and PBX fraud were among the main
items on the agenda of the Communications Fraud Control
Association's annual conference last month in Pentaggon City, Va.
Over 150 attendees representing more than 100 firms and
organizations participated in the conference.

<HEAD>Gift and Novelty Dealers See Big Bucks in Bart Simpson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bart Simpson may be a cocky upstart in the land
of television, but the spiky-haired cartoon kid already is a champ
in the gift and novelty industry.
   Products bearing his image _ including T-shirts, college
insignia sweat shirts, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons and
posters _ are the hottest items at the Atlanta National Gift &amp;
Accessories Market.
   Buyers attending the quarterly Atlanta show are stocking up for
the fall and winter months, so exhibit space in the 200-plus
showrooms is stocked heavily with back-to-school and Christmas
items.
   Bart, Homer and the rest of the clan from the Fox TV show ``The
Simpsons'' have arrived with a bang, exhibitors said. And unlike
Batman _ ubiquitous last year but virtually absent now _ the
popular nuclear family looks to be a long-running hit for novelty
dealers.
   ``To say it's the hottest item we've had is an understatement.
He's the hottest thing I've seen in 10 years,'' said Chris Nilan,
sales manager for Nilan's Alley Inc., which sells novelty items to
stores throughout the Southeast.
   Nilan, showing off a wall full of Bart knickknacks, said he
expects to reap $2 million in sales from Simpsons merchandise
within the next six months. That's about four times what he made
from E.T., the extraterrestrial movie character that sparked a
craze in the 1980s.
   ``This has a wider demographic appeal,'' Nilan said Wednesday,
the second day of the 10-day show. ``The kids love it and the
parents love it too. And the yups think he's the neatest thing
since Hershey bars.''
   Nilan said demand for Simpsons items has been made even more
intense because the creators of the program are limiting the
licensing of products. ``The people who didn't react early are not
going to have it,'' he said.
   Not everyone loves Bart, though. Nilan said he has stopped
carrying T-shirts with the Simpson kid and the slogan
``Underachiever, and proud of it'' because of complaints from
parents that it was sending out ``the wrong message.''
   Exhibit space at the show also prominently features dozens of
items emblazoned with other pop icons such as the New Kids on The
Block, Dick Tracy and Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as
standbys Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny and the Muppets.
   Then there are such items as dancing Coca-Cola cans and Statues
of Liberty. They are flexible table top radios that _ like last
year's hit novelty item, the dancing flower _ sway to the music.
   Such items carry on the tradition of oddly appealing but utterly
useless objects as the pet rock and the mood ring.
   ``That's the gift industry's dream _ who is going to come up
with the next pet rock,'' said Suzanne Pruitt, a spokeswoman for
the Atlanta Market Center, which hosts the show.
   The gift show also offers a number of accessories for the
hard-to-please executive.
   Darrah &amp; Co. Ltd., a regional wholesaler, is taking orders for
the Stress Express, a desktop launching pad that ejects a miniature
helicopter.
   ``It's for the busy executive who is stressed out and can't
think of anything better to do,'' said Michael Gabelman, a sales
representative for Atlanta-based Darrah. ``You set up landing pads
around the office.''
   Gabelman added that one of his best-selling items recently has
been a line of recycled stationery products being marketed in
response to the heightened interest in the environment.
   Despite the cartoon-inspired items and offbeat novelties, the
industry also relies heavily on traditional themes, said Ms. Pruitt.
   One showroom, called ``Classic Collections,'' features such
things as hand-painted welcome signs and old-fashioned bird houses.
   Ms. Pruitt also noted that a seminar at the show is devoted to
showing shop owners how to establish a bridal registry. ``Marriage
is back in,'' she said.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Appeals To Houston Summit For Debt Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has
appealed to world leaders preparing for the Houston economic summit
to forgive part of Poland's foreign debt.
   In letters to the heads of state of Japan, Canada, West Germany,
the United States, Great Britian, Italy and France, Mazowiecki
``expressed readiness for broad cooperation in seeking a solution
acceptable to all parties concerned,'' the official PAP news agency
reported Wednesday.
   The seven leaders are to meet for three days starting Monday in
Houston, Texas, to discuss international economic issues.
   Polish economists and their Western advisers, including the
World Bank, have said restructuring the country's $42 billion debt
is crucial for the success of its economic overhaul.
   Poland's Western debt is the largest in Eastern Europe. Its
repayment obligations would consume virtually of its export
earnings, leaving little money to invest in its struggling economy.
   In February, the government announced it would freeze payments
on its debts.
   Later that month, it reached agreement on rescheduling $10
billion in debt with the Paris Club, an informal grouping of
creditor governmemts that holds about $27 billion of Poland's debt.
About $9 billion is held by private banks, and the rest is owed to
international organizations.
   The February accord reduced by about a quarter Poland's yearly
payment obligations, but Poland has been urging its Western
partners to cancel part of the debt as a practical necessity and as
a way to support the country in its transformation to democracy.
   Western governments have backed Poland's ambitious effort to
transform its socialist economy into a capitalist system, but have
been reluctant to cancel debts.
   Much of the credit was extended to the the Communist regime of
the 1970s. It was used for massive, but poorly conceived,
industrial projects that failed to produce anticipated profits, and
for a flood of consumer goods in an attempt to win public affection.

<HEAD>Consultant Says Humor Can Help Sales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If laughter can fend off disease, it should
be able to help revive an ailing business.
   That's the premise pushed by Malcolm Kushner, an author and
self-styled ``humor consultant.'' He claims people who elicit
laughs at work get more done and go further than their sourpuss
colleagues.
   ``I teach people to communicate the fact that they have a sense
of humor,'' said Kushner, 37, whose ``The Light Touch: How to Use
Humor for Business Success'' (Simon and Shuster, $18.95) recently
hit book stores.
   He can't teach the delivery of Jay Leno or the lightning-quick
wit of Robin Williams. But Kushner tries to point out where humor
fits in the workplace, as well as what's appropriate and what's not.
   Racial and sexual slurs are always inappropriate, but Kushner
says a competitor can be used effectively as the butt of a joke.
   His example: ``How can you tell when a (competitor's) executive
has been using a word processor?''
   Answer: ``There's white-out on the screen.''
   Humor acts as a magnet that draws people in, and it can help
make a point, Kushner asserts. It also softens stress, motivates
people, helps resolve conflicts and shields hostile remarks, he
says.
   ``Managing, selling, negotiating, planning, decision making _
all the fundamental tasks associated with business life become a
little bit simpler when people are prejudiced in your favor,'' he
writes in his book.
   Lee Iacocca, Ronald Reagan and Mario Cuomo have shown that
successful people don't have to be afraid to joke around, Kushner
says. Indeed, having fun at your own expense can be a powerful
tool, he says.
   ``For eight years, Ronald Reagan poked fun at how old he was ...
and we loved it,'' Kushner said in a recent interview. ``When the
Iran Contra (scandal) hit, everyone wanted to give the guy the
benefit of the doubt. Imagine the same scandal hitting Nixon or
Carter. We would have said, `Nail the guy.' The first day.''
   Kushner quit his job as a lawyer with a San Francisco firm eight
years ago and took up humor consulting. He's had some tough
clients, including the Internal Revenue Service and the San
Francisco Sheriff's Department.
   He's also worked with many Fortune 500 companies, focusing on
the Silicon Valley, which is close to his Santa Cruz home.
   Bob Brownson, a senior marketing executive for Digital Equipment
Corp. in Maynard, Mass, said he has hired Kushner twice, at a rate
of about $1,500 for a one-day seminar and $3,000 for a dinner
presentation.
   ``He did an excellent job of improving the quality of our
meetings so that we could get on with the more important business.
He got us to lighten up and look at ourselves in a little more
realistic way,'' he said.
   ``You work so hard in our business, you begin to believe that
selling a computer is the most important thing in the world. And
it's not.''
   Kushner cites a 1983 Stanford University study that found
laughter can have the same health-improving effects as regular
exercise. Although he has no statistics to prove it, Kushner says
the same medicine might improve the financial health of a company.
   His book outlines dozens of techniques for introducing humor
into conversation and presentations. Humorous personal anecdotes
are great icebreakers, and old jokes are useful as analogies, he
says.
   Self-effacing humor can make a person more likeable, he says.
   His book cites Fred Hoar, an executive with Miller
Communications in Mountain View, Calif., as an example in a chapter
called ``Building Yourself Up by Putting Yourself Down.''
   ``A veteran Silicon Valley advertising and public relations
executive, Hoar knows that his name has an unfortunate connotation,
particularly when linked with his profession,'' Kushner writes.
   The executive starts his presentations by saying, ``My name is
Fred Hoar.''
   ``That's F-R-E-D.''

<HEAD>24 Donor Nations Widen Aid to Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thoughout with agreement, comments.</NOTE>

   Two dozen rich nations Wednesday
extended their aid program for Poland and Hungary to four other
East European nations that have shed their communist ways for
free-market economies.
   The countries remained divided on the question of extending aid
to the Soviet Union, however. West Germany wants quick action on
such aid while the United States and Japan want to wait for further
reforms there.
   The agreement to grant financial aid to Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,
Czechoslovakia and East Germany came at a meeting of foreign
ministers of the Oranization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, a Paris-based group of industrial democracies.
   The ministers excluded Romania from the aid package because of
doubts about its commitment to democratic reforms.
   Wednesday's meeting did not fix specific aid figures. These will
emerge in the months ahead as each donor makes its own pledges in
food, money, credits, loan guarantees and other assistance.
   ``It was a conference designed to take stock, see whether we
should and could decided to add countries'' to the aid package,
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters.
   Aid to the new East European beneficiaries is bound to run into
billions of dollars in the long term.
   Already the 24 donor nations have pledged more than $12.4
billion in food, economic and environmental aid to Poland and
Hungary since they began coordinating their aid program last summer.
   The aid effort is coordinated by the European Community
Commission, the executive body for the group of 12 West European
countries.
   In a communique, the ministers said the four additional
beneficiaries of aid merited help in view of the reforms they have
begun ``based on the rule of law, the respect of human rights, the
introduction of multi-party systems, the holding of free and fair
elections and the establishment of market economies.''
   Of Romania, where newly elected officials relied on miners last
month to suppress anti-government protests, they said:
   ``Recent events in Romania have not created the conditions in
which the implementation of coordinated assistance should be
extended to that country under present circumstances.''
   Aid to the Soviet Union will be discussed at next week's summit
of the leaders of the world's seven most industrialized nations in
Houston, Texas. The issue also is under review within the EC.
   ``We cannot expect the Soviet Union to resolve problems
regarding the transition to a market economy on their own,'' West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters.
   ``They urgently need help, not only financial but in the form of
advice. It is in the common Western interest to give this support
to the Soviet Union because a deterioration of the situation will
put (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev off course and in
danger.''
   But U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he wants to
see more reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``We take note of the fact that the Soviet Union is spending
somewhere between 18 and 25 percent of its gross domestic product
on military expenditures,'' he told reporters.
   ``And ... we have problems with the expenditure of somewhere
between nine and $15 billion a year to support regimes around the
world that in the past at least have been hostile to the views and
interests and principles of the United States.''
   The Soviet Union, unlike the four countries that were added to
the western aid program Wednesday, has not asked for western aid.
   But the issue of Western aid has become linked to efforts to win
Soviet backing for immediate and full membership of a united
Germany in the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Wednesday's meeting was attended by officials from Poland,
Hungary and the four new beneficiary countries.
   Bulgarian Foreign Minister Boiko Dimitrov said of country's
economic reforms, ``The stupendous task that we are facing is
insurmountable without substantive international support.''
   Witold Trzeciakowski, who led the Polish delegation, said ``only
a continuing support of the developed countries will allow the
Polish people to persevere in this difficult and dangerous
transition process.''
   East Germany was accepted as a new aid recipient although it has
merged its economy with West Germany's.
   The OECD's member nations are: Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United
States and West Germany.

<HEAD>Pickens Plans to Increase Shares in Koito</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman rebuffed in his
attempts to get a seat on the board of Koito Manufacturing Co.,
plans to turn up the pressure by boosting his stake in the Japanese
auto parts supplier.
   Pickens said he will move quickly to raise his stake in Koito to
33 percent from 26 percent, despite having his request for four
board seats soundly rejected at Koito's annual stockholders meeting
last week.
   ``We'll probably start this week,'' Pickens said Wednesday.
``We'd like to move up to one-third ownership if we can.''
   Pickens has spent $1 billion on his stake so far. He said it
would cost about $200 million more to buy the 10 million shares
that would bring him to 33 percent. With such a stake, Pickens said
Japanese law would allow him to take part in some decisions made by
Koito management.
   ``The reason is that it gives us additional power as a
stockholder,'' Pickens said. ``That threshold is important in
corporate Japan.''
   Pickens and Koito have been battling for the past 16 months.
Pickens, the company's largest shareholder, has demanded seats on
Koito's board. Koito has said Pickens is interested only in
``greenmail'' and points to his reputation as a corporate raider.
   Greenmail is a practice of buying up large amounts of a
company's stock to force the company to buy it back at a premium to
maintain control.
   Pickens and a delegation of about 50 Americans stormed out of
Koito's annual meeting last week after a stormy session that pitted
his delegation against the company's Japanese shareholders.
   He said he had a tape recording of insults that Japanese
shareholders yelled to the American delegation during the meeting.
He said the Japanese called the Americans dumb and repeatedly told
them to go home.
   ``The translator was telling us some of them but I wasn't aware
that this was going on'' at the time, Pickens said, addingg that he
received a translation of the tape this week.
   Pickens has long contended that Koito management is biased
against foreigners and participates in Japan's keiretsu system,
which links companies and their suppliers.
   Pickens believes that Toyota Motor Co., Koito's second-largest
stockholder and the biggest buyer of its parts, has played a major
role behind the scenes to keep him and his representatives off the
company's board.
   He has contended that Toyota uses its muscle to win lower prices
from Koito and thereby gain profits at the expense of Koito
shareholders.
   Pickens plans to take his complaints to the International
Economic Summit in Houston next week.
   ``I will certainly talk to anybody that will listen about the
unfairness that I see in corporate Japan,'' he said. ``We are fools
to open our markets to the Japanese when they don't allow us to
participate in theirs.''

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, the London-based
advertising conglomerate, said it agreed to sell the U.S.
consultancy Gartner Group Inc. for $70 million.
   Information Partners L.P., a Boston-based investment group, will
pay cash and a promissory note or shares for Gartner.
   The sale of Gartner, a Connecticut market information and
product data supplier, is part of Saatchi's plan to sell off its
consulting businesses to reduce debt and concentrate on
communications operations, the company said Wednesday.
   Information Partners, which specializes in communications
concerns, has proposed paying $55 million in cash and $15 million
in either a subordinated promissory note or exchangeable preferred
stock, the company said.
   Saatchi said it is paying an estimated $4 million for an
accurate evaluation of Gartner's net asset value.
   The sale is expected to go through within the next six weeks,
the company said.
   Saatchi paid $86 million for Gartner in June 1988.
   In the six months to March 31, Gartner had a pretax loss of $1.8
million following a $1.8 million profit in the year to Sept. 30.

   Advertisements touting General Motors Corp.'s
Buick Division as the most trouble-free U.S.-made car were already
being made by the time a survey showing that ranking was released.
   GM learned last month that for the second year in a row, Buick
would rank in the top 10 in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial
Quality survey. Advertising departments worked overtime to cash in
on the ranking, Buick advertising director Jay Qualman said Tuesday.
   Tuesday, the day after the survey was released, a dozen
television commercials were poised for broadcast nationally to brag
about the Power survey's ranking.
   ``We've been working around the clock to get it ready to run,''
Qualman said.
   Carmakers use the Power survey much as they do car- or
truck-of-the-year awards given out by automotive magazines: If a
company's vehicle ranks high, they brag about it. If not, they
ignore it.
   ``We do look at those (awards) very hard,'' Qualman said.
   Consumers should expect to see ads from automakers whose
vehicles ranked high on the survey. Quality is increasingly
important to buyers, and the industry acts accordingly.
   GM is in the midst of a program called ``Putting Quality on the
Road,'' in which every GM employee is acting as a surrogate
salesperson urging friends and acquaintances to consider buying GM
products.
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca in May wound up a six-city
tour praising his company's cars as having quality as good as any
others.
   For years, Ford Motor Co. has hung on to the advertising line:
``Quality is Job One.''
   Although domestic automakers have been harping on quality in
their advertising, overseas companies consistently rank higher than
their U.S. cousins in Power surveys.
   In the latest survey detailed in The Power Report, a monthly
publication by the Agoura Hills, Calif.-based marketing company,
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus Division got the best scores among car
brand names.
   It was followed by Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Nissan Motor
Corp.'s Infiniti Division. Buick was fifth.
   Within a day of the survey's official release, Toyota and Mazda
issued news releases crowing about their cars' and trucks' showings
in the survey.
   In a list of specific models, the Toyota Cressida was ranked the
most trouble-free car sold in the nation, followed by the Mercedes
E-Series, Toyota Camry, Lexus LS400 and Mercedes S-Class.
   The highest ranking U.S.-made car was the Buick LeSabre in sixth
place.
   On the truck side, Mazda ranked highest with its pickup rated
the most trouble-free model. The highest-ranking U.S. truck brand
was Ford at No. 4. Among specific models, Ford also had the highest
ranking among U.S. makers, with its Bronco II holding down the No.
5 spot among all trucks.
   The Power Initial Quality survey compiled responses from about
26,000 buyers of 1990 model cars and about 6,500 answers from among
19,000 truck buyers.
   Each was asked about problems encountered during the first three
months of ownership in a dozen broad areas including squeaks and
rattles, paint and water leaks.
   Automakers and their specific vehicles were ranked on a basis of
number of problems reported per 100 vehicles sold. The top-ranked
Lexus division, for instance, had 82 problems reported per 100
vehicles while the Lexus LS400 car had 74 problems per 100.
   The results are spelled out in a 200-plus page report with
attached charts and graphs that is supplied to Power's carmaker
clients, who pay tens of thousands of dollars for the information.

   Sales of American flags are enjoying new
glory this year in a sales boost that flag companies attribute to
increased patriotism and the bitter debate about burning Old Glory.
   ``It's been a banner year, and that's not just a flag company
joke,'' said Steve Sevits, vice president of sales for the Uneeda
Flag company located near Albany.
   By Independence Day, the flag season is in full swing. But it's
not just the traditionally patriotic holidays _ Memorial Day, Flag
Day, Presidents Day and the Fourth of July _ that accelerate sales.
   Flag companies say the Supreme Court's June ruling against state
laws that ban burning of the American flag also has boosted sales.
   ``The flag-burning issue got the patriotic movement going
again,'' said David Liberman, president of the Valley Forge Flag
Co. in Great Neck, N.Y. ``People became more conscious of it and
went out and bought a flag. Retail stores even increased their
stock.''
   Sevits claimed his company's sales were up 17 percent this year.
   ``People are seeing more flags around so they want one,'' he
said.
   Sales of fire-retardant flags also are up. Sevits said he sells
truckloads of flags made from Koralex, a polyester fiber that
resists burning.
   ``Not only are they fire retardant, but they also float in the
breeze instead of snap. Snapping wears out a flag more quickly,''
he said.
   Sevits estimated that a flag displayed outdoors typically will
last from 10 to 15 years, depending on weather conditions.
   Flag industry sales figures are hard to come by, because most
companies are privately owned and manufacturers and dealers are
reluctant to disclose figures. But flag dealers and others in the
industry generally say sales have been rising for more than a
decade.
   ``I've been selling flags for 13 years and I've seen sales go up
each year,'' said David Jolly, owner of D&amp;M Merchandisers Inc. in
Cohoes, N.Y. ``I think patriotism is the reason for the increase.''
   Business began booming for many flag companies in the mid 1970s
as the nation prepared to celebrate the 1976 bicentennial, Liberman
said.
   ``It was the biggest flag-selling period in history,'' he said.
   Sales escalated in 1979 with the taking of American hostages in
Iran. The 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, the 1984 and 1988
presidential elections and the flag-burning issue have continued
boosting sales, Liberman said. He said flag sales reflect the
political state of affairs more than than economics.
   ``Patriotism is cool now, so sales are good,'' Liberman said.
   Valley Forge sells millions of flags of various types each year
at prices ranging from $1 to $2,000, said Liberman, who has worked
for 20 years at the company his grandfather started after World War
I.
   The company sells American flags, state flags, flags of other
nations and custom flags and banners. Seventy percent of its
business is in sales of Old Glory, Liberman said.
   He said 10 percent to 15 percent of all U.S. households own
American flags.
   Sevits declined to release sales figures for his company. He
said Uneeda Flag sells thousands of flags to customers in New York,
New England and Hawaii and has provided flags for exhibits in
Alaska and Europe.
   The 3-by-5 foot American flag models, the biggest sellers, cost
$25 to $30. Sevits said many customers spend another $300 for a
20-foot flagpole.
   He said his most expensive flag, which measures 30-by-60 feet,
sells for $2,000. But there isn't great demand for it.
   ``I guess you'd use one of those on an aircraft carrier if
you're heading into Beirut,'' he said.

   Eastern Airlines confronts its problems with an
ambitious campaign that combines personality advertising with
grainy realism about a company in crisis, but publicity experts
question whether the plan will work.
   The ``100 Days'' commercials, starring court-appointed trustee
Martin Shugrue, are running prime-time and during newscasts in 33
markets. The company won't say how much it's spending in the
campaign, in which Shugrue admits Eastern must climb out of a
``large, deep hole.''
   ``Eastern's been a troubled carrier for a long time, and there's
been a build-up of negatives,'' said Michael Henderson, senior vice
president for advertising.
   The appointment of Shugrue on April 12 by a federal bankruptcy
court gave Eastern's marketers a chance to present a new image.
   ``He represents the most dynamic portrayal of a new beginning.
He's new, he's fresh and he doesn't carry any baggage with him,''
Henderson said.
   The 100 Days campaign shows Shugrue fielding questions from
Eastern employees at a hangar and talking with passengers.
   There are references to Eastern's bad labor relations history
and crippling Machinists strike, which began March 4, 1989, and led
to a filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days later.
One passenger mentions ``maintenance,'' not an issue that airline
advertising usually addresses.
   But Shugrue emphasizes change, pledging that Eastern will be
better each of the 100 days.
   ``Starting today when you fly Eastern, you won't see many signs
of the months behind us,'' he says.
   He tells employees: ``...the human equation will be paramount at
Eastern. If that thinking is a change from what you've experienced
before, so be it.''
   Those commercials have angered Eastern's unions, who say Shugrue
can't claim improved labor relations when he's made little progress
in union negotiations.
   Eastern's commercials intentionally look unprofessional, with
microphones squealing and plane engines roaring.
   ``It looks like it was filmed by some guy across the aisle with
his home videocam,'' said David Williams, of New England
Consultants. ``It's unrehearsed and realistic. That's where a lot
of sincerity comes from.''
   Williams is among many advertising specialists impressed with
the campaign. But some are skeptical about whether it will help
turn Eastern around.
   ``When you've got a bad name, no amount of well-executed
advertising can change it,'' said Al Ries, a Connecticut-based
consultant. ``If you really want to communicate the fact that
Eastern has changed, you should change the name.''
   Ries said besides Eastern's troubled history, the name Eastern
makes it sound like a regional carrier irrelevant to people
elsewhere. Allegheny Airlines changed its fortunes after becoming
USAir, he said.
   He recalled Eastern used personality advertising before, when
Frank Borman, a nationally known hero as an Apollo astronaut, was
chief executive. If Borman couldn't change Eastern's image, Ries
said, it's doubtful Shugrue can.
   But Henderson said Shugrue, a veteran airline executive, is
well-known in the travel industry. The campaign is targeted mainly
at luring business travelers and lessening reliance on unprofitable
cut-rate fares.
   The 100 days campaign comes while Shugrue is enjoying a
honeymoon with Eastern's creditors. He was appointed trustee after
the creditors lost patience with the management led by Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, whose parent company Texas Air Corp. has since
changed its name to Continental Airline Holdings.
   The creditors have said they are willing to give Shugrue time to
save Eastern. They've dropped, for now, proposing liquidation of
the airline, which is still in the reorganization phase of federal
bankruptcy protection laws.
   But Shugrue's honeymoon with Eastern's unions seems to be over.
The Machinists say he has done little to settle their strike, and
Eastern pilots, who ended their sympathy strike last November, are
unhappy that few pilots have been given their jobs back.
   Riled by the 100 Days commercials, 600 union members
demonstrated June 30 at Miami International Airport, urging the
public to boycott Eastern.
   ``He's trying to be Lee Iacocca, and he's no Lee Iacocca,'' said
Frank Ortis, president of Machinists Local 702.
   The Chrysler Corp. commercials featuring Iacocca are generally
considered the most successful use of a corporate chief in
personality advertising.
   ``If Shugrue really wants to make Eastern better, he would get
the dedicated professionals who built this airline back to work,''
Ortis said. ``That's the only way Eastern is going to survive.''

<HEAD>US, Western Allies Asked to Send Economic Aid to Soviets</HEAD>

   The United States and other Western countries
are being urged to rush to the rescue of the faltering Soviet
economy with an emergency aid package of up to $20 billion.
   Without such assistance, supporters of the plan say, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could be toppled from power at a
time when the West is tantalizingly close to signing agreements
with the Soviets on arms control and other important issues _ on
close to its own terms.
   But opponents say the assistance could end up as a massive waste
of money that would simply allow Gorbachev to delay measures needed
to institute a market-oriented economy.
   President Bush will be lobbied extensively by both camps in
coming days, first by other Western leaders at the NATO summit in
London on Thursday and Friday and then at the annual economic
summit which begins in Houston on Monday.
   The Houston meeting, bringing together the leaders of the
world's seven richest economies, will be the first such meeting in
the United States since 1983.
   Bush and his counterparts from Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada will be grappling with a contentious trade
fight over agricultural subsidies as well as considering proposals
to protect the global environment and relieve the crushing debt
burden on Third World countries.
   But the Soviet aid question is likely to dominate the
discussions.
   Both French President Francois Mitterrand and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl are pushing to give Gorbachev the $15
billion to $20 billion in Western assistance he is seeking in
outright grants and loans.
   Just a few months ago, the Bush administration curtly dismissed
the idea of Western aid to the Soviets when it was proposed by
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt.
   But since that time the administration has come under pressure
to reverse its opposition, especially from Kohl, who wants Soviet
acquiescence in a speedy unification of East and West Germany.
   Conservatives contend such aid would amount to paying ransom
money at a time when the Soviet government is still spending
heavily on its own military and supporting client states in Cuba,
Angola and Afghanistan.
   Asked about Soviet aid on Tuesday, Bush repeated his assertion
that ``economic reform is essential'' before aid is extended. He
said billions of dollars had been wasted in the early 1970s in
Western loans to Poland before that country was ready to make
needed reforms.
   ``I have explained to our economic summit partners and to the
Soviets and to others that we have specific problems with ...
giving money to the Soviet Union at this point,'' Bush told
reporters in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   But Gorbachev stressed in an interview Monday that the Soviet
Union needs Western assistance now, not after further economic
reforms are taken.
   ``I should say at this point we need more cooperation, while the
government is working out measures for the transition to a market
economy, to make this process less painful, to make it easier,''
Gorbachev said in an interview with CBS News after the opening of
the Communist Party Congress.
   Behind the scenes, the administration appears to be trying to
work out a compromise on the aid question.
   What may emerge at the Houston summit is a two-track approach in
which Western nations willing to provide direct assistance would be
allowed to do so while the United States and other countries such
as Britain, Japan and Canada would limit their help to technical
assistance.
   Among areas being explored by the administration are providing
experts in such fields as housing, banking, accounting and
management training to give advice to the Soviets on ways to set up
a free-market system.
   Bush signaled his tolerance for a dual approach last week when
he said that he didn't want to get into a position of telling Kohl
``what his lending policy or his finance policy should be.''
   The Houston summit could end up with a vague statement of
support for Gorbachev that would give individual countries room to
pursue their own policies.
   On trade, Bush has proclaimed that his No. 1 priority in Houston
is breaking a deadlock on global free trade talks.
   The United States is demanding a phase-out of all
trade-distorting farm subsidies within 10 years, but Europeans are
fighting the effort, which they say could cost 2 million to 3
million European jobs.
   The dispute is threatening to scuttle an ambitious four-year
effort to liberalize the world trading system under the 97-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The administration believes that overhauling the GATT rules
offers the best hope of expanding export opportunities for American
farmers and businesses and thus lowering the country's huge trade
deficit.
   The farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers worldwide $245
billion last year.
   Without progress in attacking the subsidies, the United States
believes many Third World countries will balk at supporting efforts
to expand GATT rules to cover trade in services, such as banking
and insurance, and beef up protection against copyright piracy,
which cost American companies $60 billion annually in lost sales.
   The perennial issue of how to ease the $1.3 trillion Third World
debt burden will also be addressed in Houston. Last week, Bush
proposed to forgive part of the $12 billion in debt owed by Latin
American countries to the U.S. government.
   In discussing the plan, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
conceded that it could set a precedent for offering similar relief
to debt-strapped Eastern European governments such as Poland.
   At last year's economic summit in Paris, one-third of the final
communique was devoted to the issue of protecting the global
environment. Issues such as global warming and deforestation are
expected to be addressed in Houston as well.

<HEAD>Union: Checchi Wants To Explore Eastern Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines union official thinks it
would be ``a great marriage'' if Northwest Airlines bought the
troubled carrier, but others say Eastern's pension liabilities and
labor troubles would make a deal difficult.
   ``It's a fairy tale,'' said Rich Siakel, a spokesman for
Northwest's pilot's union in Bloomington. ``There are pieces that
make sense, but not the whole thing.''
   Some said Northwest may be primarily interested in Eastern's
Atlanta and Miami hubs or its East Coast routes.
   The prospect of an acquisition was raised Tuesday by a union
spokesman who said Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi wants to meet
with the Machinists union to discuss the possibility of Northwest
buying Eastern.
   ``Everything is just exploratory at this point,'' said Jim
Conley, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists
in Washington.
   Conley said Machinists officials met Monday in Washington to
discuss the problems integrating Eastern employees into Northwest's
operation. He said the meeting was a prelude to one with Checchi,
but said he does not know when that meeting will take place.
   Robin Matell, spokesman for Miami-based Eastern, said a June
memo to employees said Pan Am and Northwest had shown interest in
buying Eastern, but meetings and discussions were not an indication
of an imminent takeover.
   ``Eastern's desire is to create a successful, independent
airline, but it's impossible to rule out a merger or buyout,'' the
memo said.
   Officials at Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest, the nation's
fourth-largest carrier, would not comment on whether Eastern is a
possible takeover target. But Checchi repeatedly has made public
his intention to expand Northwest, possibly by buying an entire
airline or parts of one.
   Eastern, the nation's ninth-largest airline, has been
reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from creditors since
March 1989, when Machinists walked off the job. Pilots and flight
attendants called off sympathy strikes last November.
   Since April, Eastern has been run by court-appointed trustee
Martin Shugrue, who was an adviser to a group of investors led by
Checchi in a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest last year.
   The leader of the machinists' union at Eastern, Frank Ortis,
said a Northwest-Eastern merger ``would be a great marriage.''
   ``It's speculation, but in our opinion, it would be a great
merger and a great buy,'' he said. ``Northwest is a great airline.
Mr. Checchi appears to be very good with public relations and labor
relations.''
   The Machinists form the largest union at Northwest and Eastern,
representing nearly 24,000 workers at Northwest and 8,500 at
Eastern.
   Siakel, of Northwest's pilots union, said an Eastern acquisition
would invite the kinds of service problems Northwest encountered
with its 1986 takeover of Republic Airlines.
   When Northwest and former Republic employees were working side
by side and earning vastly different wages, a deterioration of
morale and service gave rise to the nickname ``Northworst.''
   William Genoese, head of the airline division for the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Checchi's primary
interest in Eastern is acquiring its Atlanta and Miami hubs.
   Northwest's only existing southern hub, in Memphis, ``is not
producing the way they thought it would. It doesn't have the
traffic,'' Genoese said.
   But Shugrue is only interested in selling Eastern if someone
buys all of it, Genoese said. ``I don't see anything really
developing,'' said Genoese, whose union represents flight
attendants at Northwest.
   Northwest also would benefit from Eastern's routes on the East
Coast, where Northwest is ``relatively weak,'' said Morton Beyer,
president of Avmark, an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
   Beyer said deterrents to a merger would be consolidating the two
work forces and the huge unfunded pension liability Northwest would
inherit.
   Eastern calculates its unfunded pension liability at $390
million, but a spokeswoman for the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. said the liability is about $800 million.
   ``Yes it is a deterrent,'' Beyer said of the pension issue,
``but how big a deterrent is actually debatable.''
   He said a $390 million cost item would not automatically kill a
deal potentially worth more than $3 billion.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Plans to Buy Western Union Telex and Other Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
has agreed to buy selected parts of Western Union Corp.'s Business
Services unit for $180 million.
   Western Union, of Upper Saddle River, has been having financial
troubles for the past few years and is in the midst of a
restructuring.
   Under the agreement announced Tuesday, AT&amp;T would buy the assets
used to provide Western Union's EasyLink electronic mail service
and its Telex and packet-switched services.
   AT&amp;T would take on Western Union's 1,160 Business Services
employees and the unit's customer base, said John Smart, president
of Business Communications Services, in a news release from AT&amp;T's
Basking Ridge offices.
   The agreement does not include Western Union Priority Services,
which provides Mailgram, Priority Letter and Custom Letter
services. It leaves the company with approximately 2,500 employees,
said Western Union spokesman Warren Bechtel.
   The transaction completes the transformation of Western Union
from a telecommunications company to a financial services and
paper-based messaging business, said Robert J. Amman, president and
chief executive officer of Western Union.
   The deal would also help the company pay a major portion of its
new first priority notes issued to bondholders as part of the
company's restructuring, said Amman. On June 14, the Securities and
Exchange Commission approved Western Union's plan to swap $530
million in debt for new notes and stock.
   Western Union wrote off $603 million in special charges in the
first quarter of 1988, in connection with the planned sale of the
company's microwave voice-switching facilities. In 1988, the
company reported $32 million in losses.
   Faced with making a $51 million biannual interest payment by
June 15, the company told regulators in March that it would have to
seek bankruptcy court protection if it couldn't meet its debt
interest payments.
   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Lynn Newman said the Western Union unit earned
more than $629 million last year and AT&amp;T is looking forward to its
continued profitability.
   ``It wasn't a huge amount of money for a buy, but we're getting
a good match with our existing electronic messaging system ... and
we've got the added customer base,'' said Newman.
   The sale needs regulatory approval and is conditioned on
completion of a Western Union debt restructuring plan. The
companies said the deal should be completed by September.

   The world economy is slowing down and
growth has virtually halted in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
as some governments undertake drastic market-oriented reform, a
U.N. study says.
   The 1990 World Economic Survey, released Tuesday, says world
economic output increased by 3.1 percent in 1989, compared with 4.4
percent in 1988.
   Industrialized market economies continued to expand, growing by
3.5 percent, and although the figure was lower than the 4.3 percent
of 1988 it was stronger than had been expected, the report says.
   Economic growth in the developing world as a whole slowed from
4.5 percent in 1988 to 3.4 percent in 1989. Economic performance
varied greatly by region.
   The report agreed in general with the findings of the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
which said last week that the economies of the industrialized world
remain on a steady course.
   Like the OECD report, it warned against inflation, especially in
East European countries that are changing from state-controlled to
market economies.
   ``Economic growth in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union came to
a virtual halt in 1989,'' the report says, adding that output
increased by just 1.2 percent.
   U.N. economists said they do not expect a bright picture for the
immediate future in countries restructuring their economies,
although the long-term prospects could improve with painful reform.
   ``The danger of rapid inflation in the reforming socialist
countries is a major concern,'' says the report, ``requiring
prudent monetary and fiscal policies during the transition to more
market-oriented economies.''
   In several Latin American countries hyperinflation is a serious
problem, it says, and stabilization policies are likely to prove
costly in the short term. Long-term prospects are uncertain.
   The survey, compiled by the U.N. Department of International
Economic and Social Affairs, says the economies of South and East
Asia grew by 6.2 percent last yeasr, compared with 8.2 percent in
1988, the survey said.
   China's growth rate delined sharply, from 11.4 percent in 1988
to 3.9 percent in 1989.
   Latin America and the Caribbean saw just a 0.7 percent increase
and per capita output fell for the second consecutive year.
Inflation was unprecedented in the region.
   In Africa, economies expanded by 2.8 percent in 1989, below the
rate of population growth, and per capita output fell as a result.
   In West Asia, economic recovery continued with a 2.5 percent
growth rate. Economic stabilization measures stalled growth in
Mediterranean countries.
   The survey proposed establishment of a Central European Payments
Union, similar to the European Payments Union established after
World War II, as a temporary measure to assist reforming Eastern
European countries in their transition to market-oriented economies
with convertible currencies.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies today in thin, early European trading. Gold prices were
mixed.
   Traders said the dollar was suffering from the market's interest
in the German mark following German monetary union on Sunday.
   ``The market is liking what it's hearing about monetary union,''
said a Frankfurt trader. ``It's very pro-mark right now and the
dollar is falling a little into the background because of it.''
   Ian Francis, assistant foreign exchange director at Morgan
Grenfell and Co. in London, said the dollar could fall further if
Friday's U.S. employment data indicates that U.S. economic growth
is slow.
   Some dealers said the U.S. currency could turn up sharply if
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fails to get the support he
needs for his economic reforms from the Soviet Communist Party
Congress meeting in Moscow.
   ``The dollar could turn with a vengeance,'' said Carlo Galazzi,
senior dealer at Nikko Bank (U.K) Ltd. in London.
   Dealers said trading was quiet because of the U.S. Independence
Day holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.38 yen to a closing 150.30 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 149.77 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6458 West German marks, down from 1.6509
   _1.3900 Swiss francs, down from 1.3930
   _5.5235 French francs, down from 5.5400
   _1.8543 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8578
   _1,207.30 Italian lire, down from 1,210.50
   _1.1612 Canadian, down from 1.1622
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7885, compared
with $1.7800 late Tuesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $361.25 a
troy ounce this morning, down from $361.75 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $361.40, up from $361.00 late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $3.92 to close at a bid $362.46.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.93 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $4.96.

   The dollar plunged against the yen and other major
currencies in Tokyo today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index inched up and Japanese bonds rallied strongly.
   The dollar closed at 150.30 yen, down 1.38 yen from Tuesday's
151.68-yen finish. It opened at 150.25 yen and ranged between
149.90 yen and 150.65 yen.
   The U.S. currency had edged up 0.28 yen on Tuesday, but its fall
since last Thursday now totals 4.12 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's low opening in Tokyo Wednesday
followed its decline in overseas markets.
   ``In addition to the yen, the dollar was lower against almost
all the other major currencies,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer
with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   There was no specific economic factor behind the selling, she
added.
   ``Today's dollar-selling was technical adjustments, trying to
push it below the 150-yen level,'' she said.
   Other dealers said expectations of lower U.S. interest rates
caused the dollar's weakness. Lower interest rates tend to make a
country's currency less attractive to overseas investors.
   About $16.06 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose
31.32 points, or 0.10 percent, closing at 32,445.92. The index rose
254.37 points on Tuesday.
   The Nikkei was up 100.66 points at the end of the morning
session but gradually fell in the afternoon, when market players
sold high-tech issues due to the yen's appreciation, traders said.
   Construction, real estate and steel issues did well, but trading
was inactive because institutional investors remained on the
sidelines, said Masashi Yamane, a trader with Nippon Kangyo
Kakumaru Securities Co.
   Estimated first section volume was 550 million shares, down from
Tuesday's 450 million.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 87.11 points from 86.64 on
Tuesday, pushing the yield down to 7.165 percent from 7.265 percent.

<TEXT>
   A run on deposits has forced a state
government to close a group of lending institutions to prevent a
chain reaction like the one that hit their American equivalent, the
savings-and-loan industry.
   Victoria state also pledged Tuesday that all of the small
uninsured depositors at the failed Farrow Corp., the southeastern
state's largest such institution, would get all their money back.
   Some 220,000 Australians had faced the loss of their life
savings in the failure of Farrow. The corporation is comprised of
three so-called building societies, which like American S&amp;Ls were
primarily established to make home-mortgage loans.
   The decision to refund the depositors could cost the financially
troubled state up to $800 million, though the final toll will be
determined after the assets of Farrow Corp. are sold off. Banks
that loaned the company money will get first shot at those funds.
   Analysts say Farrow's risky loans caused the firm to go under _
a practice also blamed for the failure of S&amp;Ls in the United States
that is projected to cost American taxpayers hundreds of billions
of dollars.
   Some critics have called for Victoria Premier John Cain to
resign over the financial crisis, which conceivably could lead to
the fall of the state government. Victoria, Australia's second most
populous state with 4.1 million people, includes the coastal city
of Melbourne.
   There also could be repercussions on the federal level, where
the Labor government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke scored a narrow
victory earlier this year following the loss of nine Parliament
seats in Victoria.
   Government-appointed administrator Ken Russell announced Sunday
night that Farrow would not be allowed to reopen.
   The action followed a run on deposits that dropped Farrow's
liquidity from about $316 million in February to about $47 million
last week.
   Russell initially warned that some depositors could lose some of
their money. Depositors then pressured Victoria and threatened to
file suit, pointing out that then-state Treasurer Rob Jolly had
assured them in February that their funds were secure.
   In response, Cain said Tuesday the government would ensure that
all small depositors would be repaid in full over an unspecified
time and would get 20 percent to 25 percent as soon as possible.
   To offset a possible crisis in confidence in other building
societies and avoid a domino effect of runs on deposits, Cain said
Monday they would be brought into the banking sector gradually.
   Major banks will support them in the meantime through a line of
credit guaranteed by the state government.
   Legislators representing the city of Geelong had said that
without state help, the 150,000 residents would be hit hard.
Geelong was home to one of the failed building societies, Pyramid,
and half its depositors live there.
   ``Businesses using the group for banking can't get running
funds; employees aren't getting paid,'' said David Henshaw, a
member of the Victorian Parliament.
   Russell said the closure resulted from his failure to find a
buyer for Farrow. The societies' assets now will be sold, with
those proceeds first going to banks that had lent to Farrow.
   Analysts say the failure was due to a high-risk loan strategy
that fell apart as the commercial property market collapsed.
Analysts say the strategy began after the son of Farrow's founder,
Bill Farrow, and David Clarke took over the 50-year-old group in
1986.

<HEAD>Report: Oil Companies Boosting Foreign Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies operating in the United States
relied more on foreign production than domestic and spent more
money overseas to look for new oil for the first time last year,
according to an industry survey.
   The shift reflects the steady decline in domestic oil production
in recent years, in part a consequence of relatively weak world oil
prices, and increased concerns about the environmental impact of
oil exploration and production in the United States, the survey
released Tuesday by Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. said.
   ``The broad conclusion we can draw from this year's study is
that the world oil industry is entering a new era, and U.S.
exploration and production companies are successfully adapting to
the changing environment,'' said Victor A. Burk, managing director
of oil and gas industry services for Arthur Andersen.
   For the first time last year, the companies surveyed had greater
foreign oil reserves than domestic reserves, saw oil production
from foreign sources surpass domestic production, and spent more on
exploration and production for new oil overseas than in the United
States.
   The 11th annual study is based on data on reserve quantity,
value, cost and other details filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by 236 public companies for the five years from
1985 through 1989.
   Companies in the study included U.S. and Canadian firms and
three major foreign companies with significant U.S. operations _
British Petroleum, Royal Dutch@Shell and Broken Hill Proprietary of
Australia.
   In 1989, the companies in the study accounted for more than 60
percent of the total proved oil and gas reserves and production in
the United States.
   The United States has been the most heavily explored country in
the world. Burk said companies are shifting their exploration focus
abroad because they believe the chances of bigger ``finds'' are
better.
   ``They believe the opportunities right now are greater outside
the United States,'' he said.
   The driving forces behind the changing industry environment
include continuing declines in U.S. oil production coupled with an
increase in reliance on imports; the dramatic political and
economic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and reduced
Soviet oil production; and rapid economic growth and oil demand in

   Burk also said that in 1989, there was a further reduction in
domestic finding costs to an average $7.24, a decline of $1.03, or
12.5 percent, per barrel.
   Foreign finding costs registered a decline of almost 9 percent
to $8.73.
