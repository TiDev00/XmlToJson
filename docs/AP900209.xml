   CBS News humorist Andy Rooney was suspended for
three months without pay Thursday, although he denied making racial
comments attributed to him in a gay magazine.
   He was suspended after meeting with CBS News president David
Burke.
   ``I guess he (Burke) believes the person who said I said it,''
Rooney said, referring to Chris Bull, the reporter whose interview
with Rooney will be published Friday by The Advocate, a biweekly
magazine based in Los Angeles.
   Rooney's suspension is immediate. He won't be seen this Sunday
in his usual ``60 Minutes'' slot, a spokesman for the program said.
   ``I'd like to think that my temporary departure would cause `60
Minutes' ratings to plummet,'' Rooney said a statement, ``but the
show is too good without me for that to happen.''
   Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, Rooney's friend since the
two were correspondents in World War II, came to his defense with a
statement that seemed to indirectly criticize his friend's
suspension.
   Rooney ``is not a racist,'' Cronkite said. His ``more outrageous
comments'' may offend some people from time to time, he added,
``but any suggestions that such a rare journalistic voice should be
silenced indicates a dangerous weakness in our pluralistic
society.''
   Cronkite was unavailable to elaborate on his statement, his
office said.
   Bull's article quoted Rooney as saying that ``most people are
born with equal intelligence, but blacks have watered down their
genes because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the
most children. They drop out of school early, do drugs and get
pregnant.''
   ``I do deny (saying) it,'' said Rooney who has worked in news
and entertainment at CBS for 40 years and has been the resident
humorist at ``60 Minutes'' since 1978. In a brief phone interview,
he declined to say whether he thought Burke's action was fair.
   Rooney's CBS biography gives his age as 70; ``Who's Who in
America'' gives it as 71.
   But in his statement later, he said the controversy put Burke
``in a difficult position, and I accepted his offer of suspension
rather than to permanently end my career at CBS.''
   Rooney won his first Emmy award in 1968 for his script for a
special about lacks, ``Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed,'' a
program narrated by Bill Cosby.
   In his statement, Rooney again denied a uttering a racial slur:
``I did not say, nor would I ever have thought, that `blacks have
watered down their genes.' It is a know-nothing statement which I
abhor.''
   The Advocate article, in which Rooney also discussed
homosexuals, was entitled, ``Andy, We Hardly Knew Ye,'' and had a
subtitle, ``And Now, a Few Homophobic Minutes with Andy Rooney.''
   Rooney's suspension came just more than two years after CBS
fired Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder as an ``NFL Today'' commentator
after Snyder told a TV interviewer that blacks were better than
whites as athletes because they were ``bred that way'' during the
days of slavery in America.
   Burke didn't return phone calls and was unavailable to say
specifically why he suspended Rooney. His statement announcing the
action strongly suggested that it was due to the remarks attributed
to Rooney.
   He said he had discussed with Rooney those reported remarks, and
that ``I have made it clear that CBS News cannot tolerate such
remarks or anything that approximates such comments.''
   ``Mr. Rooney has expressed his dismay that the values of CBS
News have been called into question, and offers his deepest
apologies to any in our society who are given offense.''
   At the end of Rooney's suspension, Burke said, ``we will have
further discussions about his future association with CBS News.''
   Rooney said he wanted to continue with CBS after his suspension
ends. ``I hope so,'' he said. ``I hope that I will.''
   He said he would continue writing his twice-weekly syndicated
humor column, which he said is distributed to about 260 newspapers.
   Bull, who says he didn't tape-record his interview with Rooney,
on Thursday reiterated that his quotations of Rooney, taken down
during a phone interview three weeks ago, were accurate.
   On Wednesday, Benjamin Hooks, director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, described
Rooney's reported remarks to the magazine as ``ill-informed and
racist,'' and New York Mayor David Dinkins called CBS to ``register
shock,'' according to a spokesman.
   Rooney earlier got in hot water with homosexual groups because
of because a remark he made in a Dec. 28 CBS special, ``A Year With
Andy Rooney: 1989.''
   In that show, he said that, ``many of the ills which kill us are
self-induced,'' and then cited ``too much alcohol, too much food,
homosexual unions, cigarettes.''

<HEAD>Dunn Named Aerospace Writer to Succeed Retiring Benedict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcia Dunn, who has specialized in
science and medical stories as an Associated Press writer in
Pittsburgh, has been named the AP's aerospace writer, based at Cape
Canaveral.
   The appointment was announced Thursday by AP Executive Editor
William E. Ahearn. She succeeds Howard S. Benedict Jr., who is
retiring after 37 years with the AP, including three decades
covering the space program.
   ``If anyone can be considered the `guru' of a beat, it is Howard
Benedict,'' said AP President Louis D. Boccardi. ``He has covered
the history of America in space. He has led us to the stars.''
   Benedict, 61, has covered the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration since the early days of the program. He has
witnessed and reported on hundreds of launches from Cape Canaveral,
including the first manned space flights in the Mercury program
through the Gemini flights, the Apollo moon missions, Skylab and
the more recent shuttle flights.
   Ms. Dunn, 33, joined the AP in Pittsburgh in 1979 and worked for
two years in the Columbus, Ohio, bureau before returning to
Pittsburgh in 1981. She has specialized in covering science and
medicine, including the emergence of Pittsburgh as a national
center for organ transplant operations.
   Ms. Dunn is a native of Washington, Pa., and a graduate of
Duquesne University. She was a reporter for the Herald-Star in
Steubenville, Ohio, before joining the AP.
   Benedict, a native of Sioux City, Iowa, joined the AP in Salt
Lake City in 1953. He was named to the AP Newsfeatures staff in New
York in 1956 and transferred to the Tampa bureau two years later.
In 1959, he was named correspondent at Cape Canaveral (later Cape
Kennedy), where he covered NASA and the ``space race'' until 1974.
   During the mid-1970s, a period of few manned space flights,
Benedict transferred to Washington, where he covered the White
House and transportation issues. He returned to Cape Canaveral in
1984.
   Benedict has earned many honors for his aerospace writing and is
a multiple winner of the Robert Ball Memorial Award for space
writing, presented by the Aviation-Space Writers Association.

   Thieves stole more than $1.6
million in antique silverware and furniture from the home of the
Earl of Roden after leaving the 80-year-old peer tied to a chair,
police reported.
   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement Thursday that
the four masked raiders broke into the earl's home Wednesday in the
village of Bryansford, about 25 miles south of Belfast.
   Police said the thieves tied the earl to a chair and fled in a
van. A neighbor found the peer and freed him Thursday morning.
   The silverware bore the earl's family crest. The stolen
furniture included a Japanese red lacquer bureau and an 18th
century French bureau. Police said a number of valuable oil
paintings in the earl's home were damaged.
   There was no indication the raid was connected with the
British-ruled province's sectarian and political strife.

   First, a judge said begging in subways and
terminals was OK; then a court said beggars could be banned.
Everything had changed for these panhandlers and everything was
still the same.
   They were still hungry, and they were still homeless.
   ``Are you going to give us some money? No? Then go, get out of
here,'' said one homeless man at Pennsylvania Station on Thursday.
   Another man stood at the entrance with a cup and a sign:
``Homeless and I don't drink, hungry. Thank you very much. God
bless you all.''
   He demanded money for an interview, saying ``I know my rights.''
   He did not know that he had lost a right that he had temporarily
_ the legal right to panhandle at the railroad station.
   On Jan. 25, a federal judge barred the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey from enforcing a rule banning beggars from the subway system
and rail and bus stations.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand ruled that panhandling was a
form of free speech, protected by the Constitution.
   Then, on Wednesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put
Sand's decision on hold while the ruling is appealed.
   Begging was illegal once again.
   Caren Gardner, a spokeswoman for the Transit Authority, which
operates the subways, said the agency is resuming its ``Operation
Enforcement'' and rules banning begging and other activities it
believes are offensive to commuters.
   ``We're just going to go ahead and enforce the rules and
regulations that do exist in the subway system,'' she said.
   Police officers said Thursday they had yet to be told to crack
down on beggars or anyone else as a result of the court ruling.
   ``How you doing? Working hard?'' Transit Authority Police
Officer Brian Newcombe asked one homeless beggarn in Penn Station
as she walked past with a coffee cup containing several coins. She
smiled and moved on.
   ``I don't throw them out,'' he said. ``I just ask them not to do
it in front of token booths.''
   Newcombe said the homeless fight for territory in the train
station.
   ``The Port Authority is like a jungle,'' he said of the bus
terminal located on the edge of Times Square, an area infested with
drug dealers, pickpockets and homeless people. ``It's safer here.''
   At the bus terminal on Thursday, dozens of homeless poked
through garbage cans, loitered by stairways and remained curled up
and sleeping beneath blankets on floors or benches as noon
approached.
   Port Authority spokesman Mark Marchese said it would resume
preventing the homeless from sleeping at its bus and rail station
but it had never forced them to leave. ``It's not a heartless
operation that we run,'' he said.

   Not far from the Smithsonian's museums and
galleries is a photo exhibit with shock value. Sen. Jesse Helms and
his anti-pornography partisans won't be offended, but frequent
travelers might consider staying home next time.
   Hanging along the main hallway at the National Transportation
Safety Board's headquarters are 25 pictures of charred, broken
aircraft, a burned-out school bus, a collapsed bridge, derailed
trains, automobiles engulfed in flames and a crippled tanker
sliding beneath the waves.
   The gruesome gallery was the idea of acting board chairman James
L. Kolstad, whose agency annually investigates about 3,000
accidents _ from plane crashes to gas pipeline ruptures _ and
studies such safety concerns as drug abuse among truck drivers.
   ``My purpose was to display graphic examples of just how
horrendous these accidents can be, in the hope that they won't
happen again,'' Kolstad said. ``I want to remind everyone of what
can happen when mistakes are made in the cockpit of a plane, the
cab of a truck or the bridge of a ship.''
   Kolstad sponsored an agencywide photo contest and invited his
320 employees to send their best _ or worst _ action pictures to
Washington for judging. Each of the 12 winning entries netted a
$100 prize for dramatic impact. Other photos on display came from
newspapers, accident witnesses and other sources.
   ``The unfortunate part of our business is that we get some great
disaster pictures,'' said Kolstad aide John Moulden.
   One of the most dramatic scenes in the gallery is a color photo
of the U.S. tanker American Eagle sinking in the Gulf of Mexico in
1984 after it exploded and broke in half, killing seven crew
members.
   The notorious tanker Exxon Valdez is pictured in drydock, with
inspectors examining the twisted hull that struck a reef and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince
William Sound last March.
   One of the board's favorites shows a near-catastrophe: a
Piedmont jetliner that overshot the airport runway at Charlotte,
N.C., in 1986 and plowed to a halt just yards from railway tracks
carrying an oncoming train.
   Another narrowly averted disaster is seen in the scarred hull of
the American-owned cruise liner Celebration, which was carrying
2,200 people when it collided last year with a Cuban freighter in
the Caribbean. The freighter sank and three crewmen died, but none
aboard the cruise ship was injured.
   ``Had the freighter been traveling faster and the Celebration
slower, there probably would have been a substantial loss of life
and a significant catastrophe at sea,'' said Kolstad.
   Said agency spokesman Alan Pollock: ``This is a sober reminder
of the seriousness of what we do, and the tragedies we deal with.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Majority Rule or Mob Rule?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Majority rule. Free speech. Political liberty.
Government by the consent of the governed.
   These exalted concepts helped topple governments throughout
Eastern Europe last year, but the past few weeks have shown that
democracy is not necessarily the only alternative to totalitarian
rule. Mob rule is another.
   If despotic governments can trample on human rights, so can
intolerant masses. While democracy may well take root in Eastern
Europe, that outcome is not preordained.
   ``We do not call democratic a regime in which 51 percent of the
population may slaughter the remaining 49 percent with impunity,''
says Leslek Kolakowski, a Polish emigre and student of Marxism.
   The loosening of totalitarian reins in Eastern Europe has
exposed political, ethnic and religious bigotry that the
post-Marxist regimes may have difficulty containing.
   Bulgarians by the thousands, for example, used their newly won
liberty to protest a decision by the fledgling government in late
December to end _ yes, end _ oppression against the Turkish
minority.
   The episode produced an irony. Guess which political group was
perhaps the most stalwart defender of Turkish rights? The Bulgarian
Communist Party, somewhat of a latecomer to the civil liberties
camp.
   In the Soviet Union, there are some who apparently believe that
one of the best uses of free speech is harassment of Jews. The
anti-Semitism is such that Jews are applying to emigrate in record
numbers.
   ``There was always anti-Semitism,'' said Meron Nekterman, an
electrician who emigrated recently to Israel. ``But before, people
were afraid to say what they really thought. Now they can come
forward and say straightforward exactly what they want. There's no
longer any room in the Soviet Union for Jews,'' Nekterman told The
New York Times.
   The small Jewish community in East Germany may feel the same way
about their country. On Monday, hundreds of skinheads goosestepped
through Leipzig shouting praise of Hitler as well as bigoted chants
including, ``To hell with the Jews.''
   As in the Soviet Union, anti-Semitism had been largely contained
in East Germany during 40 years of rigid Marxist rule.
   In Romania, the bright hope of many for a multi-party democracy
was set back somewhat last week when thousands of government
supporters laid siege to the headquarters of two opposition
parties, demanding their dissolution on grounds they were trying to
organize a coup.
   In the Soviet Union, glasnost has meant the lifting of the dead
hand of repression but it also has galvanized long-suppressed
ethnic hatreds in the Transcaucus region and demands by some
Shiites in Azerbaijan for either reunification with Iran or
outright independence.
   Now it is up to the new rulers in Eastern Europe to decide on a
question that the traditional democracies historically have had
difficulty with: How much leeway should be given to non-democratic
forces in a democratic country. At what point does free expression
infringe on the rights of society as a whole?
   Americans, given their own history, have little grounds to be
smug about Eastern Europe's democratic growing pains. At the time
of the nation's birth, political liberty was limited to white male
landowners. Almost 200 years passed before all blacks were assured
the right to vote.
   Columnist Charles Krauthammer predicts that once the euphoria of
ousting the tyrants is passed, political disillusionment in Eastern
Europe is inevitable.
   ``Democracy in the abstract is a glory second to none,''
Krauthammer has written. ``But liberated Europe is about to
experience the first half of Churchill's famous quip that democracy
is the worst form of government except for all the others.''

<HEAD>When Good Things Happen to Unhappy People, They Can Feel Sick</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Just in case people with low self-esteem want to
hear that they may have another problem, here it is: New research
suggests that happy events in their lives may make them feel sick
later on.
   The culprit appears to be stress that arises when good fortune,
such as finding a sweetheart or landing a promotion, forces them to
reassess their low self-images, researchers said.
   ``If you think of yourself as basically a loser, and all of a
sudden you're accepted in the best sorority in town, and you're
doing really well in school ... you're forced to rethink some key
aspects of who you are,'' said researcher Jonathon Brown.
   Support for the idea comes from two studies conducted by Brown,
an assistant professor of psychology at the University of
Washington, and Kevin McGill of Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. The work appears in the December issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
   One study included 261 students in grades 7 to 11 at a girls'
school in the Los Angeles area, and the other focused on 107
students at Southern Methodist. Researchers measured the
self-esteem of the students and asked them which ``major life
events'' from a list had occurred to them over the previous 12
months.
   The list included such events as breaking up with a lover or
getting a new one, or losing or adding a family member. The
participants also indicated whether they considered the event to be
positive, negative or neutral.
   In the girls' school study, students were asked four months
later about illnesses they developed since completing the survey.
For students with low self-esteem, the more positive events they
had recorded, the more colds, sore throats, sinus infections, ear
infections and laryngitis they tended to report during the
follow-up period.
   In contrast, for students with high self-esteem, positive events
led to fewer reports of illness during the followup period.
   The Southern Methodist study found similar results when it
looked at how often the students visited the health center for
physical illness.
   Neither study verified medically whether the students were
actually sick, noted Sheldon Cohen, psychology professor at
Carnegie Mellon University. Such ``illness behaviors'' as reporting
symptoms or visiting the health service are not necessarily good
indicators of true disease, he said.
   That is because some people do get medically ill but fail to
recognize the symptoms, while others think they are sick when they
are not actually diseased, he said in a telephone interview.
   Most studies on the impact of life events have looked at illness
behaviors rather than verified disease, he said. Verification is
costly and time-consuming, said Cohen, who has done research on the
topic.
   While there is good evidence that life events can influence
illness behaviors, a link to physical disease is ``a much iffier
issue,'' he said.
   Recent work has suggested that only negative events increase the
risk of feeling ill, he said. The new study's hypothesis about
positive events is creative and interesting, he said.
   Brown acknowledged ``you have to be real cautious'' about saying
that the positive life events were leading to disease itself.
   Brown said similar studies should be done in older people, to
see if the effect shows up for more serious illnesses such as heart
disease. He also said that although his studies included mostly
females, he believed the results pertain to both sexes.

<HEAD>Gene Can Suppress Prostate Cancer, Researchers Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have found the first gene able to
suppress formation of prostate tumors, one of the most common
cancers among men, according to a study published today.
   The gene, called the retinoblastoma gene, or RB, was found in
earlier studies to block the formation of a rare cancer of the eye.
   In a Science magazine study published today, scientists at the
University of California-San Diego say they have shown that a
normally functioning RB gene inserted into human prostate cancer
cells is able to suppress formation of tumors.
   The RB gene is usually missing, mutated or not functioning in
such tumors.
   Dr. Robert Bookstein, one of the researchers, said the study may
aid progress toward learning how to control cancer through use of
tumor suppressor genes, such as RB, or the proteins that such genes
produce.
   ``The idea with cancer suppressor genes, since the loss of the
product is oncogenic (cancer nurturing), is that maybe putting it
back somehow will be therapeutic,'' Bookstein said.
   ``That is a distant goal, but I think a valid goal. You could
call it gene therapy ... that directly makes up for the defect in
the tumor cell.''
   Such cancer therapy, however, ``is years and years away,'' he
said.
   Barry Nelkin, a cancer suppressor gene researcher at the Johns
Hopkins University Oncology Center, said the California study ``is
potentially quite important.''
   ``A lot of people are looking for the genetic link to prostate
cancer. The few studies that have been done have not pointed to
anything specific,'' he said.
   Nelkin said finding that the RB gene is a suppressor in prostate
cancer ``gives us a clue as to the mechanism of tumor genesis.''
   Bookstein said scientists in the California study used a
retrovirus to insert the RB gene into human prostate cancer cells
that did not contain the gene.
   The genetically treated cancer cells were injected into the
right flanks of 20 ``nude'' mice, a breed of laboratory mice that
lacks an immune system. The scientists injected untreated prostate
cancer cells into the left flank of the mice.
   Within two months, tumors formed in the left flank of all the
mice. Three of the 20 mice did not develop any tumors in the right
flank. The right flank tumors that did develop in 17 mice were up
to 350 times smaller than the left-flank cancers.
   Bookstein said the fact that tumors formed at all in the right
flank showed that the transfer of the RB gene to the cancer cells
was not perfect. He said laboratory studies showed that the tumors
that developed either lacked the RB gene or it was mutated.
   ``Cells that expressed the RB gene were unable to form tumors,''
he said.
   Bookstein said much more work is needed to understand the role
of suppressor genes in prostate cancer formation.
   ``This is only the first tumor suppressor gene implicated in
prostate cancer,'' he said. ``Undoubtedly there are others. I have
already found cases with normal RB genes, so other genes have to be
involved.''
   Scientists at the University of California-San Diego laboratory
headed by Wen-Hwa Lee reported in 1988 that the RB gene was able to
block tumor formation in the cells of retinoblastoma, a rare eye
cancer.
   Other laboratories have found suppressor genes for breast, bone
and lung cancer.

   The pre-dawn mist melted quickly but
was replaced by swirling smoke from tiny devotional fires as
thousands of Hindu pilgrims prepared for their annual day of
penance.
   Their rites began at the river as they splashed in dirty water
and prayed with relatives and friends. Mothers led their toddlers
into the stream.
   A man dressed only in shorts and with his head freshly shaved
stepped from the water into a shuffle dance while others chanted
encouragement and lit incense. His eyes glittered, he drooled and
his limbs twitched spasmodically. The chanting became louder and
his dance more frenzied as sacred ash was slapped on his head. The
frenzy subsided in a few minutes and he seemed to fall into a
trance.
   Helping hands perched him on a small stool and carefully forced
a metal spike the size of a knitting needle through his cheeks. A
smaller rod was run through his tongue from top to bottom. Helpers
attached barbed hooks weighted with limes to his back.
   He didn't bleed and he suffered no apparent pain.
   This was Thaipusam in the Tamil lunar month of Thai, when the
moon is in transit across the brightest star, Pusa, in the zodiacal
sign of Cancer. It was Thursday in Malaysia this year, and the
scene described at Batu Caves, nine miles north of the capital
Kuala Lumpur, was repeated elsewhere in the country by the Hindu
devout on that day.
   Officials expected more than 500,000 at Batu Caves for the
2{-day festival. The annual mortification of the flesh is done to
pay homage to the Hindi deity Lord Subramaniam, seek atonement,
give thanks and fulfill vows.
   Thousands of bedazzled foreign tourists also made the trek,
lending the religious ceremony the raucous atmosphere of a carnival
sideshow complete with a Ferris wheel, trinkets and balloons.
   Featured players at the festival were the 3,000 who registered
with temple officials to carry a ``kavadi.''
   These ranged from relatively small wooden yokes decorated with
peacock feathers, tinsel and brightly colored paper to 60-pound
steel frames with dozens of spikes to penetrate the flesh at many
points. The kavadi symbolizes Paravani, Lord Subramaniam's peacock
steed.
   To the uninitiated, Thaipusam at Batu (Stone) Caves is a jolt, a
stunning assault on the senses where intense religious devotion is
expressed among a throng of gawking sightseers.
   While family and friends and devotional songs and beat drums,
humans covered with hooks, cheeks pierced with spears and tongues
with arrows, walked a half-mile from the river to 272 concrete
steps leading to Cathedral Cave.
   The procession was a start-stop affair as cars edged through the
dusty column and the gates were occasionally lowered at a grade
crossing between the river and the cave for passing trains. Kavadi
carriers passed several acres of temporary stalls offering food,
drink, clothing, toys, wood carvings and pictures of Indian movie
stars. Baubles, bangles and beads were available along with vitamin
pills and ``Govinda's Vegetarian Pizza.''
   Bearded mendicants solicited alms. Small boys sold camphor
pellets to be burned as devotional flames by the faithful once
inside the cave. A tour director cautioned his camera-toting
charges against pickpockets.
   Kavadi carriers shuffled faster and whirled in circles as they
approached the steps. Several insisted on making the climb in quick
spurts of 20 or more steps at a time.
   The stairs are divided in the middle, with human traffic kept to
the left going up and descended on the right. Soldiers, police and
white-suited first-aid attendants helped control the crowd.
   The vast limestone cave was lit inside by strings of electric
lights, devotional fires and a beam of daylight from a vertical
shaft through the top at one end. Thousands packed the main floor
of the cavern, which smelled of incense, sweat, jasmine and bat
dung.
   Penitents headed for a grotto holding the jewel-encrusted image
of Lord Subramaniam. A priest removed the spikes and some kavadi
carriers collapsed in exhaustion and religious fervor. Sacred ash
and lime juice was applied to their wounds, but even after the
trance lifted. there was no apparent pain.
   Several years ago, researchers from the United States and
Australia separately investigated the seeming lack of pain, but
without conclusive results. They did say that the lime juice and
sacred white ash, found to be mostly burned cow manure, had nothing
to do with it.
   The few willing to talk about their deed said it was done for
intensely personal reasons. One said he vowed to carry a kavadi for
three years after he regained his health after a motorcycle crash.
Another said he did it to honor his father.
   The tradition at Batu Caves originated before the turn of the
century, temple chairman S. Sockalingam said. Hindus in India have
many sacred places in hills and mountains, and there are celebrated
cave temples. Tamils from southern India brought the observance of
Thaipusam when they came to what was then Malaya to tap rubber.
   India has banned such self-torture but it continues here with
unabated fervor. Sockalingam said some of the wooden rods used to
pierce the cheeks had been growing so long that a one-yard limit
was imposed this year.

   The remains of eight
American servicemen killed more than two decades ago in the Vietnam
War were returned home to military honors under a steel gray sky.
   ``Home at last,'' said a sign behind about 150 soldiers and
veterans who watched the arrival Thursday of a military transport
plane. A brief ceremony was capped by the traditional playing of
``taps,'' which echoed across the cold concrete airport apron as
flag-draped caskets were carried to hearses.
   Earlier in the day, the remains identified by the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii had been placed aboard the jet
at Hickam Air Force Base.
   Six sets of remains belonged to Army soldiers killed in the
crash of a South Vietnamese air force CH-34 helicopter shot down in
Laos on Nov. 30, 1968. The remains were recovered in a joint
excavation by the governments of the United States and Laos in
March, Air Force officials said.
   The remains were identified as those of: Maj. Samuel K. Toomey
III of Independence, Mo.; 1st. Lt. Raymond C. Stacks of Memphis,
Tenn.; Sgt. 1st Class Arthur E. Bader Jr. of Atlantic City, N.J.;
Sgt. 1st Class Gary R. La Bohn of Wixom, Mich.; Sgt. 1st Class
Klaus E. Scholz of Amarillo, Texas, and Sgt. 1st Class Michael H.
Mein of Cape Vincent, N.Y.
   Also among the eight remains were those of a serviceman who died
Oct. 2, 1968. His name was withheld at the request of his family.
   The eighth set of remains was identified in November as that of
Air Force Col. Charles D. Roby of Iowa Park, Texas.
   Roby was killed while flying an F-4 Phantom jet on a
reconnaissance mission over North Vietnam March 3, 1967.
   The remains were to be kept at Travis Air Force Base, about 45
miles northeast of San Francisco, pending arrangements by relatives.
   By Thursday, there were still 2,309 Americans missing in the
Vietnam War.

<HEAD>US, Latin Officials Nearing Agreement on Drug Summit Communique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Latin officials are close to
agreement on a communique for next week's drug summit pledging U.S.
help to revamp the drug-dependent economies of Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia, sources say.
   The communique to be signed at the four-nation meeting also
would commit President Bush to press other Western nations to
provide economic aid to the Andean nations, said a South American
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The document is being prepared for the signature of Bush and the
presidents of the three Andean countries who will meet Feb. 15 for
a drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
   U.S. military assistance to the Andean countries is not spelled
out in the document, but the Latins have insisted it be restricted
to equipment and training rather than direct U.S. military
involvement in interdiction, said the South American diplomat.
   Those familiar with the document described it as broad in tone,
without specifying how much money the United States would give the
Latin nations in exchange for their participation in the war on
drug production and trafficking.
   However, the document will get into specific issues regarding
interdiction and military cooperation, economic alternatives to the
drug trade, and efforts to get other countries' aid in the
anti-drug effort, said Michael Skol, deputy assistant secretary of
state for South American affairs.
   ``We're very close'' to agreeing among the countries on final
wording, Skol said Thursday.
   He called the document ``a very comprehensive document of
cooperation on the drug issue'' that recognizes rights and
responsibilities of producer and consumer countries ``without
finger-pointing.''
   Among the promises expected from Bush at the summit, according
to those familiar with the summit communique, are:
   _Tighter enforcement on export of precursor drugs _ such as
ether _ that are used in the production of cocaine from coca leaves.
   _Money for crops to substitute for the lucrative coca fields.
   _Promotion of private initiatives for trade opportunities and
technical assistance to help the Andean countries expand their
markets.
   _Support for expanded trade opportunities for the Andean
countries.
   _Pressure on other nations to help the drug-production nations
with economic and trade assistance.
   In addition to the communique, the summit may produce an
agreement between Bolivia and the United States to renew an
extradition treaty that has not been updated since 1900, said one
diplomatic source.
   The White House has praised Bolivia for extradition action _
particularly the December extradition of an alleged drug
trafficker, Luis Arce Gomez _ but the Bolivian law itself was
written before drug crimes were considered and thus does not
address them specifically.
   The U.S. portion of the summit communique is said to hew closely
to what Bush proposed last month for the second year of his
national drug control strategy.
   Bush has proposed $206 million in new anti-drug spending _ in
military, law enforcement and economic assistance _ for the Andean
nations in the 1991 fiscal year, as part of a four-year $2.2
billion plan. The administration has said that allocation of money
is dependent on cooperation by the drug-producing nations in the
anti-drug efforts.
   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, recently scoffed at U.S.
proposals for anti-drug spending as insufficient to combat the
multibillion-dollar industry. Garcia also was irked with the U.S.
invasion of Panama in December, and agreed to attend the drug
summit only after President Bush promised to withdraw the invasion
troops by the end of the month.
   The document addresses the issues of money laundering and
control of U.S. export of weapons that are used by drug lords, and
could provide for information sharing on gun exports, said one
source.
   President Virgilio Barco is known to be anxious to talk to Bush
about the need to reinstate a coffee export quota system that was
beneficial to Colombian farmers. It was unclear if coffee will be
addressed in the presidents' communique or will be included in
general terms under the category of U.S. assistance to redirect the
Latin countries' economies away from drugs.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil began washing up on a
popular beach Thursday evening as clean-up boats skimmed the ocean
around a tanker that spewed 295,000 gallons after apparently being
punctured by an anchor.
   Small black globules of Alaskan crude oil splashed a
quarter-mile stretch of Newport Beach, a community that includes
some of Southern California's most-expensive beachfront property.
   The 811-foot tanker American Trader, which had carried 21
million gallons, lay off the coast surrounded by an oil containment
boom and Coast Guard boats. Workers labored to patch a 3-foot hole
punched through the ship's bottom near an offshore mooring station
Wednesday.
   ``Every indication is the vessel is no longer leaking oil,''
Coast Guard Rear Adm. William Kime told a press conference after an
inspection flight.
   The slick covered an area measuring 3 miles by 6 miles. Offshore
winds held the purple sheen away from beaches until afternoon, then
reversed direction and began nudging the mess onto shore.
   ``The main part of the oil slick is still staying three-quarters
to one mile offshore,'' said Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, who
flew over the slick in a helicopter at dusk. ``A major portion of
the spill, or the slick, is heading directly to the Newport Beach
pier.''
   Huntington Beach Fire Department Capt. Bill Newton said thick
black gobs of crude were hitting along a quarter-mile of the beach
at about 8:30 p.m. The oil didn't appear to be covering the beach
in thick sheets.
   Mays said about 300 professional cleanup workers were waiting to
begin shoveling up the oil beach beginning at low tide Friday, 9:15
a.m.
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost said the ship's hull
apparently was punctured when it hit something on the bottom as the
crew prepared to hook up to an underwater pipeline that carries
crude oil to shore. It was unclear if the tanker hit one of its own
anchors or a buoy anchor, he said.
   Five skimmer boats were at work and four more were en route to
the area, off the Orange County coastline about 35 miles southeast
of Los Angeles.
   Along the shore, booms were laid to protect the environmentally
delicate estuaries at the Santa Ana River mouth, Anaheim Bay, Bolsa
Chica Wetlands and upper Newport Bay _ all teeming with wildlife.
   Biologist Esther Burket said oil coming ashore on a sandy beach
would be less harmful than in an estuary such as Bolsa Chica, where
birds would ingest the petroleum with the plants they eat.
   ``Once it gets onto vegetation, it's a nightmare,'' Burket said.
   Eighteen oil-soaked seabirds, mostly western grebes, were
rescued from the beach and cleaned by volunteers at a lifeguard
headquarters. The count of dead birds totaled eight, said state
wildlife biologist Jon Fisher.
   Curt Taucher, a Fish and Game spokesman, said there was some
initial concern about migrating gray whales but that was not the
biggest worry. ``The concern is for the furbearing animals, harbor
seals, animals like that,'' he said.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in a press release
that President Bush would be briefed and that ``everything that can
be done is being done.''
   The broad, sandy beach at this city of 180,000 in northern
Orange County, plus Bolsa Chica State Beach to the northwest and
Huntington State Beach to the south, draw millions of sunbathers
and surfers during summer.
   Federally mandated alcohol tests given to the ship's captain,
identified as Robert Laware, the pilot, first mate and second mate
all came back negative, the Coast Guard said. Drug test results
were in complete.
   The American Trader was last boarded by the Coast Guard on Dec.
28 in San Francisco and was found free of violations were found.
Its last certificate of inspection was issued in Honolulu on May
11, 1989.
   After the hole in the tanker is patched the Coast Guard plans to
pump the remaining oil from the punctured compartment into a barge.
The same pumps were used to unload the Exxon Valdez when it ran
aground in Alaska last year and spilled more than 10 million
gallons of crude into Prince William Sound.
   There were no formal discussions on use of chemical dispersants,
said Rolf Mall, deputy regional manager for the state Department of
Fish and Game. Damage from chemicals has to be weighed against harm
from the oil, he said.
   ``The further out it gets and the deeper the water, the more
likely it is we'll use them,'' Mall said.
   Mindful of the massive Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska last year,
California politicians rushed to call for tighter controls on oil
shipping and stiffer penalties for spills.
   ``This is a wake-up call,'' said Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
   The American Trader was chartered by British Petroleum Oil
Shipping Co. USA, said Joe Braderich, manager of the firm's Los
Angeles field office.
   The spill began Wednesday afternoon while the tanker maneuvered
1{ miles off Huntington Beach to moor at a nest of mooring buoys at
an offloading station for an underwater pipeline leading to a
refinery on shore.
   The depth at the accident site was unclear. The Coast Guard put
the depth at 84 feet. However, Huntington Beach Marine Safety
Officer Steve Reuter said it was 56 feet.
   The ship, owned and operated by American Trading Transportation
Co. of New York, drops two bow anchors during such maneuvering,
said company president Sanford Schmidt.
   A swell may have lifted the ship and swung one anchor against
the bottom, Schmidt said in a telephone interview after speaking
with the ship's captain.
   A diver found a 3-foot hole in the single-hull bottom of the No.
1 forward compartment, a tank which holds more than 1 million
gallons of crude. Industry critics say tankers should have double
hulls for safety.
   The Coast Guard's Pacific Area Strike Team was called in from
its base in San Francisco. BP, with its office in Los Angeles,
hired a local cleanup company, Clean Coastal Waters, to recover the
oil but the cost of that work will be paid by American Trading or
its insurance company.
   The American Trader had picked up Alaskan oil from the vessel
Keystone Canyon in Long Beach Harbor and was to offload some of it
at the offshore pipeline for Golden West Refinery in Santa Fe
Springs, said BP spokesman Chuck Webster.
   An oil industry newsletter, Oil Spill Intelligence Report of
Arlington, Mass., said the spill was the third-largest in
California waters in the last 10 years. The largest was 1.6 million
gallons of bunker fuel from a 1984 sinking off San Francisco, the
newsletter said.

<HEAD>Theater Company Closing London Base for Four Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company has announced it
will close its two London theaters for four months, citing the need
for what Falstaff called a ``remedy against this consumption of the
purse.''
   The theater's staff of nearly 70 in London will draw half its
regular pay while performances are suspended, beginning in
November, artistic director Terry Hands said on Thursday.
   The company's two theaters in Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's
birthplace, will not be affected.
   The current sellout productions of ``Hamlet'' and ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' plus the company's earnings from ``Les
Miserables,'' the international musical hit, were not enough to
make up for a financial shortfall, Hands told a news conference
Thursday.
   ``I'm haunted by the specter of endless revivals of `Peter Pan'
to pay for endless revivals of `Peter Pan,''' he said, referring to
the J.M. Barrie play that has been a Christmas perennial.
   ``It is the 90s, it is a new decade, it is the moment to
reassess the policies that have brought us to this point, (and) all
I can say is those policies are not working,'' Hands said.
   It is the first time the company has taken such a move. No
performances will be affected because the theaters will not be
closed until November, and plays are not scheduled that far in
advance.
   The news came three weeks after the company announced an
unusually small 1990-1991 season of 21 productions. On Tuesday, the
company opened a stage production of ``A Clockwork Orange'' to
mixed reviews but capacity business.
   Hands said the 1,162-seat Barbican Theater and the studio Pit
theater, with flexible seating for up to 240, will close for four
months from Nov. 5. He said that would save the company about $2.75
million on its projected 1990-91 budget.
   Hands, who steps down at the end of the year, said he opted for
the closures, keeping in mind his successor or successors to be
named next week.
   ``I believe, in departing, that whoever comes next should be
relieved of the nightmare of the past 12 years ... without having
to spend three-quarters of the day raising, saving, or making
money,'' he said, referring to the funding woes that have beset the
company throughout the 1980s.
   Hands said the company's deficit will be $4.9 million by next
month. Thirty percent of its annual budget of $32.1 million comes
from government subsidies.
   More than 40 percent of the operating costs at the Royal
National Theater, Britain's other flagship subsidized playhouse,
are met by government grants.
   Hands called on the government to keep its funding in line with
inflation, as recommended in a report in 1984. He said funding
increases have either been at a standstill or lagged behind
inflation.
   Of the upcoming repertory, Hands said, ``I'm putting everything
back on the drawing board from June, because every single risk must
be eliminated, every single penny must be made.''
   The new musical ``Children of Eden,'' with music by American
composer Stephen Schwartz, will open in 1991 in Stratford instead
of Dec. 5 in London as planned.
   In 1985, the National Theater closed its Cottesloe auditorium
for five months to cut costs.
   Sue Rose, press officer at the Arts Council, which distributes
government money to the arts, said the organization was sympathetic
but had ``already allocated our funding for the year.''

   Here is how political events in the Soviet Union
could unfold to implement President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
political reform blueprint approved this week by the Communist
Party leadership:
   Feb. 14 _ Supreme Soviet legislature opens its next session. At
any time it can take up the Cmmunist Party's proposals for a
popularly elected president and repeal of Article 6 in the
Constitution, the party's guarantee of a leading role in society.
It can also call a special session of the Congress of People's
Deputies to confirm the constitutional changes.
   Late February-early March _ Communist Party Central Committee
meets to consider new party rules, including a switch to the
election of delegates for a national party congress by all 20
million party members, rather than the current process dominated by
party bureaucrats.
   Early March-late June _ Election of delegates to party congress.
   Late June-early July _ Party congress. Formal adoption of
platform approved Wednesday by the policy-making Central Committee,
election of new Central Committee, new party chairman and two
deputies.
   Pravda editor and Central Committee member Ivan T. Frolov said
Thursday many details are being left up to the Supreme Soviet,
including the timetable for enacting the political reforms and the
scheduling of a nationwide presidential election.

   A priest who had joined the Rev. George A.
Stallings Jr. in the new African-American congregation that caused
his excommunication is asking for reinstatement with the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Washington.
   The Rev. Bruce E. Greening told parishoners earlier this week
that Stallings had asked him to resign from the Imani Temple over
failure to support Stallings' public statements about separating
from the Roman Catholic Church.
   Stallings, himself a Catholic priest, has been excommunicated,
and the archdiocese has said that Catholics who follow him will
receive the same treatment.
   Greening, who was the first priest to join Stallings last
summer, sent a letter to Cardinal James A. Hickey, the Washington
archbishop, saying he wants to ``remain in communion with the
church'' and open a ``dialogue'' leading to reunification.
   ``Father Greening's letter was received today and is being
carefully studied. Every avenue of reconciliation consistent with
the faith and practice of the Catholic Church will be pursued,''
said a statement released Thursday night by archdiocese spokeswoman
Eileen Marx.

<HEAD>Moynihan Defends Social Security Tax Cut; Wins Little Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan says his plan to
cut Social Security taxes would neither endanger retirement
benefits nor worsen the federal deficit, but he apparently is
winning little support for the plan.
   ``The tax rates in the bill will fully finance benefits and
maintain a safe reserve fund for 20 years longer than the current
arrangement,'' Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in defending his plan before
the Senate Finance Committee.
   ``This point is conceded by all but those who favor the politics
of fear,'' he said Thursday.
   President Bush and his advisers have argued against a Social
Security tax cut on grounds it likely would lead to an increase in
other taxes and jeopardize benefits for future retirees.
   There was little show of support at the hearing for Moynihan's
bill. It was criticized by White House Budget Director Richard G.
Darman; by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office; by four of five non-government economists who
testified, and by committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   Bentsen said he sees no way the government can afford to
increase the budget deficit by the $38 billion to $55 billion that
the tax cut would cost. Moynihan uses the lower figure; Darman, the
higher.
   That $38 billion is ``no great sum to make up,'' Moynihan said,
adding that most of it could be found by cutting the defense budget.
   ``The real point, of course, is that there are lots of ways to
reduce the deficit, but the Social Security tax is not the right
way,'' Moynihan said. ``By what right and for how long do we
continue to make the budget deficit the peculiar burden of people
who get paid by the hour?''
   Moynihan wants to cut Social Security taxes so the government
will no longer be able to use surplus collections to make the
deficit in other federal accounts appear considerably smaller than
it is. The surplus, which now is growing by about $1 billion a
week, is being accumulated for the benefit of workers in the
post-World War II generation who will be retiring in large numbers
starting in about 2010.
   Reischauer, who is Congress' chief economist, said a Social
Security tax cut without offsetting tax increases or spending cuts
could worsen inflation and ``could harm the economy's performance
over the next several years.''
   Regardless of what happens to Moynihan's bill, Reischauer added,
``A permanent increase in taxes or reductions in other federal
programs appears to be a certainty (in the future), since the
retirement of the (post-World War II) baby boom will mark the
beginning of a permanent increase in the ratio of retirees to
workers.''
   Darman said the bill would either seriously damage attempts to
cut the federal deficit or cause an increase in income taxes or
other taxes.
   Raising other taxes ``would hurt the very workers Senator
Moynihan's proposal is ostensibly intended to help,'' Darman said.
``Indeed, it would hurt them doubly: first, by jeopardizing their
future retirement benefits and second, by taking back in new taxes
what it pretended to give in the way of a tax cut.''
   Darman said the Bush administration agrees with Moynihan that
the government should stop using surplus Social Security taxes to
hide the size of the federal deficit. But the answer, he said, is
the administration's proposal, which, starting gradually in 1993,
would require that surplus Social Security taxes be used only to
pay off federal debt.
   A worker now pays a 7.65 percent Social Security tax on the
first $51,300 earned each year and the employer matches the
payment. Moynihan's bill would repeal a rate increase that went
into effect Jan. 1, restoring the rate to 7.51 percent, and cut it
again next year to 6.55 percent.

   Rock star Billy Idol won't be feeling too
lonely in his recovery from a motorcycle crash. His fans have seen
to that.
   ``The tidal wave of mail has started,'' said Ron Wise, spokesman
for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``His room is starting to look
like a flower shop.''
   Idol's condition was upgraded from serious to fair Thursday
after seven hours of surgery for compound fractures to his right
leg and a broken right forearm. He allegedly ran a stop sign
Tuesday and sideswiped a car, police said.
   Idol, 34, will probably stay at the hospital for two weeks, Wise
said.
   It was unclear whether he'll be able to go ahead as scheduled
with his role in Oliver Stone's movie about Jim Morrison, the lead
singer of the Doors rock band. The movie was to begin shooting in
five weeks. Idol is cast as Morrison's best friend, Tom Baker.
   Idol, known for his sneer and spiked blond hair, reached stardom
with his 1984 album ``Rebel Yell.'' His first album in three years,
``Charmed Life,'' will be released April 17, his publicist Ellen
Golden said.

   For Olympic swimmers Tracy Caulkins and
Mark Stockwell, the 1984 Games wasn't all competition. It also was
the start of a romance.
   The two announced their engagement at Wednesday's opening of a
pool named after Caulkins.
   ``At the Olympics, I actually had my eye on Tracy's roommate,''
confessed Stockwell, 26. ``It wasn't until a recruiting trip to the
University of Florida that I realized she was a pretty neat lady.''
Caulkins went to school at Florida.
   They plan to wed in April 1991.
   Caulkins, 27, won three gold medals at the 1984 Games.
Stockwell, who swam for the Australian team, won two silver medals
and one bronze.
   Caulkins has retired as a competitive swimmer and is now an aide
to Mayor Bill Boner. Stockwell said he hopes to compete in the 1992
Olympics.

   Maynard H. Jackson III, the mayor's son, was
arrested on traffic charges for the second time in a month.
   Jackson, 19, was stopped in Atlanta on Wednesday and charged
with driving without a license and improper lane changes. Police
spokeswoman Sandra Blount said Jackson was charged and released. A
Feb. 21 court date was set.
   On Jan. 9, he was charged with possession of less than an ounce
of marijuana and following a vehicle too closely after an accident
in which his car struck the rear of another vehicle. He was fined
$150 after pleading no contest to the drug charge; a judge found
him guilty of the traffic charge and fined him $60.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson, in a statement issued then, said he had
ordered that his son be shown no special treatment.

magical, and when people stand up there and start saying things, it
breaks the spell.
   ``If I go see a group, I want to see them playing as hard and as

don't want people to talk to me.''
   Reid said he has only broken his rule of onstage silence one

   Folk-country singer Robert Earl Keen Jr., who

   ``There was no place to play,'' said Keen, who moved to Music
City in 1985 and stayed two years before returning to Texas.
   ``If you need to practice, there's a 100 percent chance that a
lot of people are going to see you and they're going to form an
opinion. When you see them in a business situation, they've already
got this notion, no matter what you say.''
   Keen, 34, said it also was tough because while he struggled in
Nashville, his buddies Steve Earle and Lyle Lovitt made it big.
   ``There were so many doors open for these people I know, and
there were no doors open for me,'' Keen said.
   Keen's latest album, ``West Textures,'' is getting good reviews
around the country.

   Wheat farmers would be in serious trouble if
the Bush administration's proposals for flexibility in the 1990
farm bill were accepted by Congress, says a wheat state congressman.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., told an Agriculture Department
official at a hearing Thursday that farm income in his district
would decrease under the administration plan unveiled this week.
   Later, English predicted that any region where agriculture
depends on one crop would be in trouble under the proposal.
   ``I don't think most members of Congress would feel comfortable
with the proposals set forth,'' English said after a hearing of the
House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains.
``It reminds me of the budget proposal. It's almost as if they
aren't trying to put forth serious proposals.''
   At the hearing, English asked Agriculture Undersecretary John
Campbell to explain how the administration's proposal to allow
planting options under the price support system would protect
farmers confined by climate and terrain to one crop from losing
their share of the market.
   ``Farmers are pretty sharp,'' said Campbell. ``They will respond
where appropriate.''
   English asked Campbell to say hypothetically which commodity
would be best to grow next year if the administration's proposal
for flexibility were in force.
   ``That's up to the farmer,'' said Campbell. He would not
elaborate further, saying instead that it would be better for
farmers to guess about market changes than about congressional
action on farm programs.
   English said in an interview after the hearing that he
considered Campbell's responses an ``abdication of the
administration's responsibility.''
   In the proposals Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter sent to
Congress on Tuesday, the administration is suggesting that farmers
be allowed to substitute crops that are covered by subsidy programs
if they see marketplace advantages to doing so.
   In order to assure that farmers will plant commodities consumers
need, the government sets price levels for certain products. If the
market price is below those levels, known as target prices, the
government makes up the difference.
   The commodities that are subsidized this way are wheat, corn,
cotton, rice, soybeans, barley, grain sorghum and oats.
   The administration's proposals intend to allow farmers to
respond to market demands rather than government planting
requirements, while still having the shelter of government
subsidies.
   The problem, as English and other see it, is avoiding
overplanting of certain crops.
   The congressman said he was particularly concerned about wheat
producers.
   ``Wheat in the past has been the most vulnerable because of the
kind of program we have and because you can grow it in any part of
the country,'' he said.
   He said there's a temptation for farmers to start producing
wheat if given the option.
   ``Usually it is followed by a sharp reduction in price and a
surplus,'' he said. ``That means we are back in these wild
gyrations as far as price is concerned.''
   English said he expected Congress to pass legislation that
provides some flexibility.
   ``Flexibility is something that people talk about, but no one
seems to know what it means,'' he said.
   English said he believes Yeutter's involvement with the
international trade talks known as GATT has much to do with the
administration's refusal to be specific about price supports.
   Many countries subsidize their exports to a greater degree than
the United States and Yeutter is trying to get them to stop the
practice. The negotiations will continue through this year.

<HEAD>Democrats to Press Ahead With Own 1991 Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are working on their
own 1991 budget that would launch new education and other domestic
initiatives while shrinking President Bush's defense proposal by at
least $4 billion to $7 billion.
   But Republicans predict their Democratic rivals will be unable
to piece together a spending plan and move it through Congress
without GOP support.
   Just 10 days after Bush unveiled his $1.23 trillion spending
blueprint for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, Congress' majority
Democrats said they will write an alternate plan to meet the $64
billion deficit target.
   ``First we're going to see if we can piece together a budget
resolution,'' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said Thursday. ``If we can do that in a way that we'll
have the votes to get the budget resolution passed, there won't be
much reason to go ahead with'' negotiations with the Bush
administration.
   But Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the
House Budget Committee, said he doubted the Democrats could craft a
budget including all the programs they seek without adding new
taxes, ``and they don't want to be the ones leading the way on
that.''
   ``My guess is after internal discussions, they'll decide to
request negotiations with the administration,'' Frenzel said.
   The Democrats' fervor was illustrated when Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee,
brandished a mock Viking battle ax during a visit to the panel by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Murtha said members of both parties are looking for a ``peace
dividend'' in the budget, reflecting possible military savings in
response to the reduced Soviet threat.
   Democrats pressed their offensive on other fronts as well. At
the Joint Economic Committee, Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
challenged Bush's claim of having submitted a budget that met his
campaign pledge of ``no new taxes.''
   ``In the budget, you submitted 33 revenue changes and 20 of them
raise revenue, totaling an increase of $13.9 billion,'' Hamilton
told Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin.
   Boskin argued there were only minor tax increases and that most
of the receipts would come from new and higher fees for government
services.
   Elsewhere, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin,
D-Wis., accused the administration of using strategic arms talks
with the Soviets to win permission to deploy weapons Congress does
not want, including nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Liberal Democrats have been complaining that Bush should have
cut far deeper than his $303.3 billion defense proposal for next
year. That figure is $7 billion higher than this year's total, but
$3.2 billion below the amount needed to stay even with inflation.
   Liberals would like to see defense spending drop below $290
billion.
   But moderates such as Panetta say they believe the figure will
end up about $4 billion to $7 billion lower. Panetta's Senate
counterpart, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., has talked about military
spending in the $291 billion to $296 billion range.
   Such figures would allow Democrats to avoid $13.9 billion in
cuts Bush has proposed in programs such as the Medicare program for
the elderly and handicapped, retirement payments to government
workers and other benefit programs.
   To hit the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman target, Democrats say they
will seek to raise the $21 billion Bush proposed in new tax
receipts, user fees, sales of federal assets and other collections,
while changing some of the components of that mix.
   Democrats believe enough room will be left in the budget for
some new domestic initiatives, likely including education, child
care, nutrition, health care and housing.
   Democrats still don't know what to do about a proposal by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut the Social Security payroll tax. A
team of top Democrats is trying to draft a party position on the
proposal, which has one major problem: It would add $62 billion to
the budget gap over the next two years.

<HEAD>New Search in Probe of Bombings that Killed Judge, Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents investigating a series of mail
bombings in the South that killed a judge and a lawyer searched
several sites in the Atlanta suburbs Thursday, the FBI said.
   Homes and vehicles were searched by agents carrying warrants
issued by a federal magistrate, said FBI spokesman Charles
Steinmetz in Washington.
   ``No arrests were made. Results of the searches are not being
disclosed at this time,'' he said, refusing further comment.
   Agents in the community of Rex, in the south Atlanta suburbs,
carried warrants naming Walter Leroy Moody Jr. and his wife, Susan
McBride Moody, the New York Times reported in its Friday editions.
   Moody, 54, a self-employed editor and writing advisor, was
convicted in 1972 of felony possession of an unregistered firearm
in connection with a bomb that officials said was to be used in a
failed extortion scheme, the Times said.
   Appeals of that conviction, the paper reported, have gone to the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a target of the mail bombings
in December.
   Killed were Judge Robert Vance of Mountain Brook, Ala., who sits
on the 11th Circuit, and Savannah City Councilman and attorney
Robert Robinson, who did work for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Two other bombs were intercepted, one mailed to the 11th Circuit
in Atlanta and one to the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla.
   A letter to a television station claimed responsibility for what
appeared to be a white supremacist group, and expressed outrage
over the rape of a white woman by a black man.
   There were similarities between the mail bombs and the bomb in
the Moody case in 1972, the Times reported, quoting an official it
didn't name.
   WSB-TV in Atlanta said its reporters at a house that was
searched recognized the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and the Postal Service agents who had been working on the
mail bombings.
   The station said the agents searched a residence and ``what
appeared to be a makeshift base of operations behind a nearby
church.''
   The searches follow days of highly visible investigation in
Enterprise, Ala.
   That probe there focused on Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, a salvage
store owner and Brian Joseph Fleming, a print shop owner.
   Authorities said a typewritten letter O'Ferrell sent in
connection with a civil lawsuit matched typewriting in a letter
claiming responsibility for the bombs. O'Ferrell said that he
apparently sold the typewriter from his salvage store and denied
having anything to do with the bombings.

   Opposition leaders say they fear the
outgoing National Salvation Front will put former ranking Communist
leaders in control of a new government that is to run the country
until elections in May.
   The new Council of National Unity, which holds its inaugural
meeting today, is to give 29 opposition parties a chance to
participate in government. It will be the first real opposition
role since the Communist takeover in 1947.
   But Valentin Gabrielescu, spokesman for the National Peasants
Party, told reporters Thursday that he believed the front's
outgoing seven-member ruling council may try to control the new
180-member Unity Council.
   Gabrielescu said the front may also try to pack the new
government with former ranking members of the now-defunct Communist
Party, which caved in with the overthrow and execution of Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December.
   ``They can be former Communists, but not big game _ not the
aristocracy of the party,'' he said.
   The 150-member National Salvation Front took power after the
popular revolution that toppled Ceausescu. The front lost four
members of its original 11-member council in the last three weeks,
including two who complained of dictatorial methods.
   The front agreed to give up its monopoly on power last week
after large demonstrations against it. The protests were prompted
by the front's decision to participate in the May 20 election,
despite an earlier pledge not to run.
   Students, who were in the forefront of the revolution, and
opposition parties said the front could not be both a player and a
referee in the election.
   Under the agreement, the front left its ruling council to run
the country until the Council of National Unity started operating,
and split off its political wing to run in the election.
   The new interim government will have 90 representatives from the
front and 29 political parties, each with three seats, and 90
prominent Romanians from all walks of life not formally
representing any parties.
   Dan Radulescu, the chief front spokesman, served notice that the
front intended to try for at least some of the non-party seats.
   He also said he expected interim President Ion Iliescu to head
the government, and ``if he isn't elected, I don't know who will
lead the council.''
   Gabrielescu signaled opposition to Iliescu, a former Communist,
however, saying: ``Maybe he will be a candidate, but we are against
it.''
   Also Thursday, the minister of religion said it will take years
to undo the moral damage caused by more than four decades of
Communism, which he said turned Romania into a nation of ``liars
and thieves.''
   Nicolae Stoicescu, a former dissident and professor of medieval
history, said that under Ceausescu's 24-year tenure, the Romanian
Orthodox Church was ``under the direct control and supervision of
Securitate,'' the dictator's feared secret police.
   Stoicescu said the church has ``a major role to play in
rehabilitating the Romanian spirit'' and correcting damage caused
by decades of Communist rule.

   China and the Soviet Union today began a second
round of talks aimed at reducing forces along their 4,300-mile
border, patrolled by hundreds of thousands of troops on each side.
   The Soviet Embassy said the talks on cutting military forces and
armaments along the frontier will continue until Feb. 22.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, reporting on the opening of the
talks, said the two sides ``commented positively on the first round
of talks held in Moscow last November and expressed readiness to
make further efforts to reduce the military forces in the border
area to the minimum level corresponding to their normal and
good-neighborly relations.''
   An embassy official said the Soviet delegation is led by G.V.
Kireev, chief of the Foreign Ministry department for socialist
countries in Asia, and consists of six diplomats and six military
experts.
   The two sides agreed to open talks on troop levels along the
frontier when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Beijing
in May.
   Gorbachev said the frontier should be turned into a ``border of
peace'' and pledged to withdraw 12 divisions, or 120,000 soldiers,
from the border by the end of this year.
   The Soviet Union is believed to have some 600,000 troops along
the Chinese border. China, armed with less sophisticated equipment,
has an estimated 1 million troops on the frontier.
   The two sides are also expected to discuss the concept of
creating a demilitarized zone along the border proposed when Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited China a year ago.
   The two Communist powers fought a brief border war in 1969 and
there have been sporadic clashes since then around disputed areas
of the frontier. Tensions have gradually eased as the two sides
moved to normalize diplomatic relations in recent years, and
cross-border trade has grown rapidly.

<TEXT>
   Fourteen of the 31 senators up for re-election
in November are starting the year with at least $1 million on hand,
with most getting considerable help from political action
committees, according to an analysis released today.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex, was the fund-raising kingpin, raising
$10.5 million since his last election in 1984 and beginning this
year with $6.1 million in his campaign coffers, Common Cause said
in a report based on recent Federal Election Commission filings.
   The poorest of the 31 was Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who has
raised just $90,860 since the 1984 election and began 1990 with
$157,817 in campaign funds.
   Common Cause, which has been lobbying for changes to
substantially curtail PAC activity, said 25 of the 31 senators
facing re-election this year have exceeded limits that would be
placed on PAC donations in a campaign finance bill the group
supports.
   Of the 14 senators who began the year with more than $1 million,
Democrat David Boren of Oklahoma was the only one who has not
accepted any PAC donations. Of all 31, only Boren and Democrat John
Kerry of Massachusetts _ who had $874,000 in campaign funds as of
Dec. 31 _ accepted no PAC contributions.
   Of the 29 whose campaigns took PAC money, Gramm was also the
leader, receiving $1.1 million from PACs in the last six years,
according to Common Cause. Illinois Democrat Paul Simon was not far
behind, reporting $976,769 in PAC contributions since the 1984
election. Kassebaum was again at the bottom of the list, accepting
$19,250 from PACs since 1984.
   The only senator remotely close to Gramm in terms of cash on
hand to begin the election year was Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who
reported having $4.1 million. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky
Republican, was next with $2.8 million. Democrat Max Baucus of
Montana had just more than $1 million.
   Gramm, considered by some a potential Republican presidential
candidate in 1996, raised nearly $6 million in 1989, with most of
that coming from a fund-raiser at the Houston Astrodome attended by
President Bush.
   Bradley's active fund raising despite his virtually certain
re-election has increased speculation he is considering challenging
Bush in 1992 or at least mulling a 1996 presidential bid.
   Common Cause complains the high-powered fund raising by
incumbents, many of whom face little or no opposition, can scare
off potential challengers because of their ability to raise huge
donations from PACs.
   In releasing its analysis, Common Cause President Fred
Wertheimer renewed his call for Congress to quickly enact new laws
limiting PAC donations and setting campaign spending limits.
   Common Cause said the 31 senators together raised $77.4 million
since all but one last faced election six years ago, with $16.6
million of that total coming from PACs. The only senator in the
group not involved in a 1984 Senate election was Republican Dan
Coats of Indiana, who 13 months ago was appointed to replace Vice
President Dan Quayle in the Senate.

   The five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council will open talks Sunday on efforts to enhance the
world body's role in Cambodia peace efforts, a U.S. spokesman said.
   During the scheduled two-day session in New York,
representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China will discuss a plan for the United Nations to
administer Cambodia and supervise elections there while
international peacekeepers guarantee security.
   The full 15-member Security Council would have to approve the
plan to clear the way for a heightened U.N. role in the Cambodia
peace process.
   Arthur Zegelbone, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, said Thursday that the five countries will be represented
at the New York meeting by officials on the assistant secretary
level.
   The five countries agreed on the peace formula for Cambodia
during a January meeting in Paris. In addition to seeking U.N.
administration of Cambodia and supervision of elections, the peace
plan calls for an ``effective U.N. presence'' to ensure internal
security for an unspecified transition period before the voting.
   The Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodian Premier Hun Sen
and the three allied guerrilla factions all have given at least
cautious support for a major U.N. role.
   The five countries said the complete withdrawal of foreign
forces must be verified by U.N. observers. Last September, Vietnam
announced plans to withdraw its troops from Cambodia.

<HEAD>Bush Says Response to Soviet Reforms Aims at `Stability'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush claims no regrets over his
restrained response to the historic political reforms in the Soviet
Union and says he hopes both Moscow and U.S. allies see it as a
``stabilizing sign.''
   Bush denied that his emphasizing of defense issues during his
three days on the road _ coinciding with Moscow's dramatic moves
toward a more democratic form of government _ was a matter of bad
timing.
   ``I think it's fortuitous,'' Bush told reporters traveling home
with him aboard Air Force One.
   The president was back in the nation's capital after a three-day
Western trip that focused on defense policy, including his call for
continued modernization of U.S. strategic weapons systems.
   He watched Army war games in the Mojave desert, toured the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco for an
update on Star Wars research and toured the Strategic Air Command
headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   At SAC headquarters, Bush on Thursday broadcast a message to
nuclear-carrying U.S. forces, telling them ``the historical changes
we are seeing in the Soviet Union are in no small part due to''
U.S. nuclear deterrence.
   He told reporters aboard Air Force One later Thursday that he
didn't think his assertiveness on national policy was out of sync
with developments in Moscow ``because it sends a clear message that
I am behind a sensible defense program and I'll stay behind it.''
   ``So I hope that message comes through in a balanced way that we
are not going to suddenly, drastically change our course away from
a reasonable defense program,'' Bush said. ``So I think the message
is one of stability, of reasonableness,'' he added.
   ``I'm not going to miss an opportunity in arms control, but
we're going to keep a strong defense.''
   Bush said he was trying to send a ``stabilizing message, not a
militant message.''
   ``And that's why I think the timing happened to be fortuitous,
because we had planned this trip before the Central Committee
meeting but it worked out, in my view, very well.''
   He said he wanted Western European allies to know that the
United States was not about abandon them or ``decouple'' from
Europe.
   ``As long as I'm president, it won't take place,'' Bush said.
   In remarks at a Republican fund-raising dinner in Columbus,
Ohio, Thursday night _ his last stop _ Bush praised party leaders
in Moscow for taking ``the first step toward pluralism'' and a
multi-party system.

<HEAD>Waxman Wants Crackdown on Animal Rights `Terrorists'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Henry Waxman wants federal law enforcers
to treat animal rights groups that break into laboratories to make
off with rabbits, monkeys and other creatures as ``terrorists,
nothing but terrorists.''
   Scientists told a congressional panel Thursday that extremist
groups such as the underground Animal Liberation Front are creating
a serious threat to university lab workers and researchers around
the nation.
   The scientists told Waxman's Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health and the environment that they have faced arson, burglary,
vandalism, theft and hate mail from such groups.
   Waxman, D-Calif., is proposing legislation to allow federal
investigation and prosecution of people who break into and commit
other crimes at laboratories receiving federal funds.
   He said members of the underground animal rights movement are
``terrorists, nothing but terrorists.''
   The Department of Health and Human Services originally supported
Waxman's measure but the Bush administration has since said it is
opposed to it because of Justice Department concerns that it will
be difficult to enforce, according to Dr. James O. Mason, assistant
secretary for health.
   The anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee Inc. has
joined other critics who say the bill would inhibit
constitutionally protected forms of protest.
   Robert F. Phalen, a laboratory director at the University of
California in Irvine medical school, said dogs he was using for air
pollution research were stolen in January 1988 and his family was
later harassed.
   ``In one case a caller harangued my 15-year-old son, saying that
his father was `evil' and would `burn in hell,''' Phalen said.
   ``We always kept our doors locked, we left external lights on,
we covered our phones at night with pillows, and we slept with
weapons near all of our beds,'' he recalled.
   But the most serious threat, the scientists said, is that
students are turning away from animal-related research out of fear.
Animal rights groups, many of which dissociate themselves from
illegal tactics beyond civil disobedience, say most of the research
is needlessly cruel and could be duplicated by other, more humane
means.

   To most, Carolyn Warmus is a bright,
energetic schoolteacher. To police, she is an obsessed woman who
pumped nine shots into her lover's wife, then met the man for
drinks and sex.
   It took a year of intense legwork by two detectives to put
together the case that made a murder suspect out of the 26-year-old
computer science teacher and insurance heiress.
   Warmus was charged with second-degree murder Monday. Police said
she shot Betty Jeanne Solomon, 40, nine times on Jan. 15, 1989,
then drove to a local hotel to meet her lover, fellow schoolteacher
Paul Solomon, for drinks and a sexual tryst in her car.
   Her attorney, Charles Fiore, maintains his client is innocent.
He said Thursday that she passed a polygraph test taken on the
advice of her family attorney five days after the slaying.
   Warmus was not the initial suspect in the killing. Solomon was.
   ``You can compare it to a large puzzle with many, many pieces,''
said Lt. Cornelius Sullivan, head of detectives in Greenburgh, a
New York City suburb near White Plains.
   Police would not say when their focus shifted to Warmus,
daughter of a wealthy Michigan insurance executive, but a vacation
trip to Puerto Rico five months after the killing may have been key
in highlighting Warmus' alleged obsession with the dead woman's
husband.
   Police said Solomon, 39, told investigators that Warmus followed
him and a friend, Barbara Ballor, 28, to Puerto Rico. Once there,
they said, she called a member of Ballor's family pretending to be
a police officer and made disparaging comments about Solomon in an
apparent effort to break the couple up.
   Police traced the call back to Warmus. Investigators then
focused on other telephone records.
   The paper trail led them to Vincent Parco, a private
investigator in New York City who told police he sold Warmus a
silencer and a .25-caliber handgun, the same type of weapon used to
kill Mrs. Solomon.
   Police say they linked the weapon that Parco sold to the killing
through ballistics evidence, but did not elaborate. The weapon has
not been recovered.
   On Thursday, Parco's New York City pistol permit was suspended
and Parco agreed to give police his weapons, said city police
spokesman Detective Joseph McConville.
   Law enforcement sources said Warmus knew Parco because she had
hired him before to investigate an ex-boyfriend, a married
bartender who lived in New Jersey.
   Police said Warmus, who lives in a high-rise on Manhattan's East
Side, told Parco she needed the gun for protection, but Parco's
ex-partner, Gabe Laura, told the New York Post she offered him
three different reasons.
   ``We figured her for a flake,'' Laura said, adding, ``We told
her to get us some proof about what she was saying and sent her
away.''
   Warmus and Solomon had been having an affair for a year,
according to an indictment unsealed Monday. They met in 1987 at an
elementary school in Greenburgh.
   At the time of Mrs. Solomon's murder, police said, Warmus wanted
to intensify the relationship; Solomon wanted to cool things off.
Investigators said he ended the affair after his wife's death.
   In her statement to police, Warmus said she called Solomon at
home hours before the murder and they talked for 45 minutes about
everything from his 15-year-old daughter Kristan's basketball team
to a bar mitzvah he attended.
   They agreed to meet for drinks at a Yonkers hotel bar at 7:30
p.m. Mrs. Solomon was killed between 7 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., police
said, adding that Warmus knew Mrs. Solomon would be home alone.
   Warmus told detectives they left the bar at 10:30 p.m., went out
to her car in the parking lot and had sex before leaving each other
about 11:30 p.m.
   Her attorney said Warmus frequently had dinner with the Solomon
family at their home and that neighbors knew both her and her car.
   ``It would be a pretty good trick for her to knock on the door,
kill her ... and leave and not be seen or have her car seen,''
Fiore said.
   Warmus' father is president of American Way Life Insurance Co.
in Southfield, Mich., whose assets reportedly are about $150
million. She grew up in Birmingham, Mich.

   A house recently purchased by a black man was
set afire in what authorities are calling a racially motivated
incident.
   The two-family building's previous owner, a white woman,
received several telephoned threats about her planned sale of the
house to the black man, said Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan. The house is in the borough of Brooklyn's Canarsie
neighborhood.
   No one was injured in Thursday's early morning fire.
   No arrests have been made.
   Mulligan said the first-floor tenants heard someone walking up
the building stairs and then a window breaking. The vacant
second-floor apartment in the house, where former owner Ellen Levy
lived until the sale, was torched, Mulligan said.
   Fire marshals determined an accelerant was poured through the
broken window and ignited. Firefighters limited the fire to one
room.

<HEAD>Illinois Joins Lawsuit Against Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH OKESON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois has joined a lawsuit filed by
ethanol producers that accuses nine oil companies of running ads
that discourage the use of ethanol-blended gasoline.
   Attorney General Neil Hartigan said at a news conference
Thursday he filed an antitrust action with the U.S. District Court
in Danville that seeks a halt to the ad campaign and fines of $1.8
million on the oil companies.
   The oil companies are accused of using ads such as ``My Gas
Contains No Alcohol'' and ``My Station Sells Clean Gas'' to imply
that ethanol-blended gasoline is unsafe and pollutes.
   Ethanol, a form of alcohol often distilled from corn, helps
Illinois corn growers and improves the environment because its
combustion produces less carbon monoxide than gasoline, Hartigan
said. Gasoline blended with ethanol also lowers fuel prices, he
said.
   In 1988, 11 ethanol producers sued the oil companies in five
states. Two of the companies that sued, Greater Rockford Energy and
Technology Co. and CEPO Inc. of Batavia, were forced out of
business in 1986, Hartigan said.
   ``This is nothing more than a consumer fraud perpetrated on an
unsuspecting public,'' said Hartigan.
   ``Illinois may have lost millions of dollars in the last 10
years through higher fuel prices and lost economic development
opportunities. Through this action, perhaps we can begin reaping
the benefits of a truly fair competitive environment,'' he said.
   A spokesman for one of the companies, Amoco Oil Co., declined to
comment on Hartigan's action, but criticized the lawsuit.
   ``We feel it's without merit,'' said Mike Thompson. ``We expect
to contest it vigorously, and we expect to win.''
   Also named in the lawsuit were Shell Oil Co.; Exxon Co., USA;
Mobil Corp.; Marathon Petroleum Co.; Chevron U.S.A. Inc.; Atlantic
Richfield Co.; Citgo Petroleum Corp.; and B.P. America.

<HEAD>Timber Dealer Denies Conspiracy to Export Federal Logs Illegally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A timber dealer accused of illegally
exporting federal logs admitted that he sold the timber to Japan,
but said he didn't know the wood had been cut from national forests.
   ``They were not marked as Forest Service logs,'' John J.
Tortorelli of Bellevue, Wash., told a federal court jury on
Thursday.
   Tortorelli and his co-defendant, Winston Bentley of Spokane,
Wash., each denied that they conspired to export federal logs
illegally to Japan two years ago. ``I never entered into any such
agreement, I never conspired to, I never even thought about it,''
Bentley said.
   Federal law forbids the export of raw logs cut from national
forests, intending the logs to be processed in U.S. mills. Raw
logs, or unprocessed timber, fetch a higher price than finished
lumber on the export market.
   Federal officials have said this case may be the first time
anyone has been prosecuted for violating the export ban, which is
designed to protect American jobs in mills.
   The concern over exports has been heightened by timber shortages
blamed for layoffs and sawmill closures.
   If convicted, the defendants each could be sentenced to 10 years
in prison and fined $20,000.
   Tortorelli is accused of arranging to buy about 160 truckloads
of logs from sawmills and independent loggers in northwest Montana,
north Idaho and eastern Washington in 1987 and 1988, then exporting
those logs while knowing they had been cut from federal forests.
   Prosecutors say Bentley assisted with some sale arrangements and
routed some timber through a yard in Mead, Wash.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Brooks asked Tortorelli why he
told a truck driver picking up the some of the logs to say they
would be processed in a domestic mill.
   Tortorelli said if a buyer reveals that he is exporting the
logs, the seller automatically wants a much higher price.
   In testimony earlier this week, several loggers and sawmill
operators who sold logs to Tortorelli said they told him the logs
had been cut from national forests. Others said some of the logs
were marked with paint or U.S. Forest Service brands.
   Tortorelli testified that he could not recall being told that
the logs were cut from federal forests, and that he dealt with many
different buyers and sellers that handled private and federal
timber.
   Cross-examination of Tortorelli was to resume today. Final
arguments in the trial were scheduled for Monday.

<HEAD>Farmers Waiting for Big Freeze Following Spring in January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rising temperatures that turned the
December freeze into a January-February thaw are bound to end as
soon as frigid air in the far north builds enough muscle, says the
Agriculture Department's weatherman.
   ``The question at this point is exactly when and where the dike
will break,'' said Norton D. Strommen, chief meteorologist for the
department's World Agricultural Outlook Board.
   Meanwhile, although most Americans enjoy the midwinter warmth,
many farmers are apprehensive.
   ``It reduces winter hardiness of the winter wheat crop,''
Strommen said Thursday in an interview. ``It promotes the early
development of fruit buds, and while we can benefit from the early
growth of pastures ... it does set us up for frost-related
problems.''
   He also said ``very limited soil moisture supplies'' are being
drawn on earlier than usual by the spring-like warmth and the
growth of pastures and winter wheat.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility operated by USDA and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this week
that last month ranked as ``the nation's warmest January on record,
following the fourth-coldest December.''
   Precipitation in January varied greatly, showing ``a large
contrast between the unusually wet South and the unusually dry West
North Central region,'' the report said.
   For example, precipitation ratings showed Wyoming had the third
driest January since 1895, while South Dakota had its sixth driest,
and North Dakota had its eighth driest January.
   By contrast, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma had
one of the wettest Januarys since 1895.
   ``The last four months in the primary hard red winter wheat
region in the central and southern plains have been extraordinarily
dry,'' the report said. ``Combined October-January precipitation
across this region ranks 1989-90 as the seventh driest such period
on record.''
   But Strommen said there are some benefits to the warmer weather,
notably for livestock producers whose feeding and watering labors
have been eased. Cattle and hogs gain weight better, and there is
minimal death losses from midwinter cold.
   ``In December, almost all the feed energy (consumed by animals)
went to maintaining weights,'' he said. The January thaw ``took all
that stress off that they had in December.''
   For weeks, dominant high-altitude currents from the Pacific have
flowed across the northern part of the United States, acting as a
fence, or dike, against the savagely colder arctic air normally
flowing down from Canada.
   ``They're really holding in a building quantity of arctic air up
over the pole,'' Strommen said. ``Eventually, we've got to tap and
release that cold air.''

   Federal support prices for wool marketed in
1990 has been set by the Agriculture Department at $1.82 per pound,
up five cents from last year.
   Mohair clipped from goats will be supported at $4.532 per pound,
down from $4.588 in 1989, according to the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   In a related report, the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board said U.S. inventory of sheep and lambs on Jan. 1 was
estimated at 11.4 million head, up 5 percent from a year ago.
   The value of the U.S. flock was estimated $998 million, up 11
percent, reflecting an increase of 6 percent in the average value
per head to $87.80. The 1989 lamb crop was put at 7.74 million, up
7 percent from 1988. The lambing rate increased to 108 per 100
ewes, compared with 98 in 1988.
   Inventories of Angora goats were estimated at 1.9 million head,

   Sales of stockers, fingerlings and fry from hatcheries rose 30
percent to $23.3 million, the report said. But sales of food-size
fish from farm operations dropped 6 percent to $250 million.
   The report said sales to processors accounted for 90 percent of
the total sales of food-size catfish.
   As of Jan. 1, the number of catfish growing operations declined
1 percent from midyear to 1,614 operations. Hatcheries dropped 6
percent to 562.
   Alabama led in the number of catfish farms as of Jan. 1 with

   A federal judge's ruling that U.S. courts have
jurisdiction over Manuel Noriega's drug case has opened the way for
the next battle: defense efforts to win access to government
secrets.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling came at a status
conference Thursday, the first time Noriega and his five
co-defendants appeared together.
   Though the new Panamanian government has stripped him of his
military rank, Noriega wore his four-star general's uniform.
   Hoeveler ordered the case to proceed after rejecting defense
arguments that Noriega, as a prisoner of war, must be transferred
to his homeland or a third country until an international tribunal
determines his status under the Geneva Convention.
   ``This court does have jurisdiction to proceed,'' Hoeveler said,
``and we will.''
   William Bryson, U.S. deputy solicitor general, argued the judge
has jurisdiction even though the government agreed to Noriega's POW
status.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino strongly dissented, saying the
government was trying to stretch the Geneva Convention to justify
what he described as the illegal invasion of Panama and detention
of Noriega.
   After the hearing, Rubino said he planned to ask the U.S.
Supreme Court to free Noriega.
   Hoeveler agreed to rule in the next two weeks on an issue both
sides agree is central to the case _ how U.S. government secrets
relating to Noriega must be handled.
   Part of the expected defense strategy is to try to introduce
material documenting links between the deposed Panamanian leader
and the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
   ``We believe a tremendous amount of exculpatory material is
hidden in agencies that the government maintains,'' said Noriega
attorney David Lewis, a New York-based expert on the Classified
Information Protection Act.
   ``We want to be able to go forward, and we don't want the
government to restrict that,'' Lewis said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James McAdams said he did not expect an
avalanche of confidential documents. He said the defense was
exaggerating the amount of material at issue.
   ``We conducted what we would call a very thorough and exhausting
search,'' McAdams said. He estimated the secrecy issue could be
settled by July.
   Lewis, calling the case a ``megatrial,'' said the government
would need at least nine months to provide the information and for
the defense to respond. With less time, he argued, the trial itself
could be interrupted frequently by appeals over unresolved secrecy
issues.
   ``To quote Tina Turner, `we can do it nice and easy, or we can
do it nice and rough,''' Lewis told the judge, paraphrasing a line
from the singer's version of ``Proud Mary.''
   Because of the secrecy issues, all sides agreed that the March 5
trial date is unrealistic. Noriega's attorneys estimated they would
need up to two years to be ready, while the prosecution said it
could be go to trial by the end of the year.
   No new trial date was set.
   During the hearing, Noriega occasionally leaned over to talk to
co-defendant Luis del Cid, who prosecutors say was one of his aides.
   Also attending were defendants Luis Saldarriaga, Daniel Miranda,
Eduardo Pardo and the only one out on bond, Brian Alden Davidow,
whose attorney is seeking a separate trial. Ten other defendants
are still at large.
   In Tampa, Fla., meanwhile, more than $250,000 in drug profits
traced to a Tampa-based smuggler who once described Noriega as his
partner was doled out Thursday to law-enforcement agencies, U.S.
Attorney Robert Genzman said at a news conference.
   The money came from assets forfeited by Steven Michael Kalish, a
convicted drug runner who told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that
Noriega agreed to let him launder as much as $100 million a month
through Panama as long as Noriega got his cut.
   Kalish said he paid Noriega more than $1 million in bribes and
agreed to pay him $3 million more.
   After his arrest, Kalish struck a deal for leniency with federal
prosecutors. In a sentencing memorandum, U.S. attorneys said the
1988 drug indictment against Noriega wouldn't have been possible
without Kalish's help.

   Soviet lawmakers are proposing unprecedented
joint hearings with their American counterparts on reducing the
danger of the unauthorized or accidental launch of nuclear weapons.
   The hearings were proposed by Yevgeni Velikhov, chairman of the
Supreme Soviet's defense subcommittee, to Armed Services Chairman
Les Aspin, D-Wis., according to the U.S. office of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity.
   Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
Thursday that ``joint undertakings such as hearings between the two
committees'' are being considered. But a spokesman said no
decisions have been made on time, place or topic.
   Velikhov made his proposal both as chairman of the Supreme
Soviet's defense panel and as chairman of the Moscow-based
foundation. It was founded in 1988 with the aim of finding
solutions to problems in such areas as international security, the
environment and human rights.
   Thursday marked the beginning of a 12-day visit by members of
the Soviet legislature's defense panel to U.S. military
installations. Members of the House committee made a similar
inspection tour of Soviet military bases last August.
   ``The Supreme Soviet is struggling to become a more independent
legislature,'' Aspin said. ``Anything we can do to promote
democratic values in the Soviet Union is in the U.S. national
interest.''
   Representatives of the International Foundation said Velikhov is
asking the proposed joint hearings be based on a report written by
members of the group's security committee.
   The report, ``Reducing the Dangers of Accidental and
Unauthorized Nuclear Launch and Terrorist Attack: Alternatives to a
Ballistic Missile Defense System,'' has been given to members of
Congress and is to be released at a news conference here on Tuesday.
   The Soviet legislative panel is scheduled to visit the Los
Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico, the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida, NORAD and Strategic Air Command Headquarters in
Omaha, Neb., Minuteman Missile and B-1B bomber facilities, Army

<HEAD>Death of Old Forests Adds Greenhouse Gas to Atmosphere, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Felling old forests in the American Northwest
may aggravate global warming by releasing millions of tons of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to a study published
today.
   Mark Harmon, a researcher at the Department of Forest Service at
Oregon State University, said that even if new trees are planted to
replace the old trees, there is still a net gain in atmospheric
carbon dioxide from the demise of the ancient forest.
   ``The young forest simply doesn't store anywhere near as much
carbon as the old forest,'' said Harmon, a finding he said is the
opposite of the ``conventional wisdom.''
   The scientist said more than half of the wood cut from old
forests is burned or used in ways, such as paper making, that
quickly puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Also, large trees
absorb carbon dioxide at about the same rate that decaying, dead
tree parts on the forest floor give it off, a balance that new
forests don't reach for more than two centuries.
   Harmon said he and his co-investigators studied the effects of
old forest harvesting on the greenhouse effect because ``we've been
concerned that decision-makers are going to make important policy
decisions based on inaccurate, armchair ecology.''
   Carbon dioxide and some other gases in the atmosphere act as a
blanket to trap heat given off by the Earth. This is called the
greenhouse effect. Some experts believe that a surplus of carbon
dioxide is causing the Earth to slowly overheat, and they warn that
such a change could disrupt the global climate. Many scientists,
however, disagree that the planet is warming up.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Harmon
reports that old growth forests _ areas that have never been logged
_ capture and store much larger amounts of carbon from the
atmosphere than younger forests.
   He said many believe that the old trees aggravate the greenhouse
effect because old forests are littered with dead branches, leaves
and other material that decays and puts carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere.
   But Harmon said a computer study shows that an old forest, with
very large trees, actually reaches a ``carbon equilibrium'' that
neither adds nor subtracts from the total carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.
   When the old trees are cut down, however, the forest litter
continues to decay, giving off carbon. And Harmon said it takes new
seedlings about 250 years to grow enough to reestablish the
``carbon equilibrium.''
   Additionally, he said that only about 45 percent of the wood
harvested from old forests is turned into lumber or other building
materials that ``store'' carbon for long periods. Much of the
material is burned, rots or is used for paper, all of which release
carbon into the atmosphere within a short time.
   In the past century, Harmon said, about 18 billion metric tons
of carbon have been released into the atmosphere from harvesting of
about 17.5 million acres of old growth in western Oregon and
Washington.
   Land use changes, such as ripping out old forests, contribute
only a fraction of the carbon dioxide that comes from the burning
of fossil fuels, the scientist said. But Harmon said that on a
global basis, the loss of forest land can be significant.
   Harmon estimated that of the total carbon added to the
atmosphere in the past century by land use change, 2 percent came
from harvesting forests in Oregon and Washington, even though the
area covers only .017 percent of the Earth's land surface.
   ``We have very poor records of land use change and how much
carbon was in a forest before it was lost,'' said Harmon. ``As a
result, these estimates have not been as precise as fossil fuel. So
I wouldn't be surprised if the actual value is substantially larger
than we estimated.''
   The forest study was coauthored by Harmon and William K. Ferrell
of Oregon State University, and Jerry F. Franklin of the University
of Washington. Science is the journal of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.

   Three years ago they threw stones at
Indian security men. At the first sign of retaliation, they would
run for cover and flee into the narrow lanes of Srinagar, waving
clenched fists as a gesture of defiance.
   But today, Moslem militants campaigning for Kashmir's
independence have graduated to Kalashnikov rifles and firebombs in
battling an estimated 40,000 Indian soldiers in the strategic state.
   Intelligence reports say the militants, most of them in their
20s, have acquired rocket launchers and even U.S.-made Stinger
missiles.
   ``India now faces the risk of fighting a prolonged guerrilla war
in Kashmir,'' said a retired colonel of the Indian army. ``And like
most other guerrilla war situations, the odds are in favor of the
terrorists.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Over the years these terrorists have graduated into becoming
real fighters, not in the conventional sense, but as guerrillas,''
said Jitendra Narain Saxena, the director-general of the
Jammu-Kashmir's 40,000-member police force.
   ``Before the police could just scare them away. But today they
stand up and try to defy,'' Saxena said.
   Saxena would not discuss the reasons for the change of mood in
Kashmir, where analysts say India faces the toughest challenge to
its unity in the country's 42 years of independence.
   More than 80 people have been killed in the wave of separatist
violence that began Jan. 20 with the arrests of more than 250
people.
   The killings and open defiance by the militants triggered a
panic in the adminstration. Curfew was imposed for days, the army
was called out and foreign journalists expelled from the state.
Curfew passes of local journalists were withdrawn and Indian
journalists working for foreign media were confined to their hotel.
   Jammu-Kashmir, home of 6 million people, is India's only
Moslem-majority state.
   Nationwide, Moslems account for about 11 percent of the
country's 880 million people. But in the Kashmir valley, the
stronghold of the militants, Moslems make up 94 percent of the 3.5
million people.
   Kashmir became part of the Mogul empire when Akbar invaded the
area in 1586. The Afghans annexed it in 1756. The Sikhs came in
1819. A Hindu king took it over in 1846.
   When Britain divided the subcontinent in 1947 into Islamic
Pakistan and Hindu-dominated India, Kashmir was given the choice to
either remain independent or join either of the two nations. After
initial hesitation, the king joined India and triggered a Pakistani
armed invasion.
   A brief war followed and India claims that of the state's 88,894
square miles of territory, Pakistan is in ``illegal occupation'' of
31,572 square miles. New Delhi also alleges that Pakistan gave away
17,094 square miles of territory to China when Islamabad and
Beijing signed a boundary agreement.
   Intelligence reports attribute the guerrillas' popularity to
fear. But many, including some junior government officials and some
Kashmir police, admit privately that even if they do not support
the militants they do not oppose them either.
   ``In Kashmir today everyone, even a 10-year-old boy, is in favor
of independence,'' said Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, the chief Moslem
priest of Kashmir.
   ``If police actions are not stopped, I have to ask the people to
join the armed struggle,'' the 45-year-old Farooq said in an
interview at his fortified home in Srinagar.
   ``The entire population has risen as one man against Indian
occupation,'' said politician Abdul Ghani Lone of the People's
Conference Party. ``It looks as if the Indian government wants to
create peace in Kashmir, but that peace will be the peace of the
graveyard.''
   Gov. Jagmohan ruled out any threat to India's sovereignty.
   ``The issue is very simple,'' he said in a interview at his home
guarded by Indian troops manning light machine gun positions behind
bunkers. ``There was lack of economic development, people are
frustrated.
   ``Once we set things right, Kashmir will again become `Jannat'
(heaven),'' said Jagmohan, who uses only one name.
   But the scene outside his home is different.
   Behind a graveyard in the old Srinagar district, 11-year-old
Riaz Sheikh holds his toy Kalashnikov rifle and waits for his
friends. Not to play, but to discuss how to become Moslem holy
worriors.
   ``Before we played cricket, but now we talk about how to
liberate Kashmir from India,'' said Riaz, whose brother, Hamid
Sheikh, a top militant leader, was shot and wounded by the police.
   ``Why you want to talk to us?'' he asked. ``Can you give me a
gun?''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Plan to Gather Statistics on `Hate Crimes'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials would gather data on ``hate
crimes'' motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnic
roots under legislation that is moving towards approval in Congress.
   ``If we're going to curb crimes of hate, we need to know their
extent,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Thursday as the Senate
approved the bill 92-4.
   The Senate shrugged off complaints from Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that the measure ``fans the fires of the homosexual
movement'' as it sent the bill back to the House, which has already
approved a slightly different version.
   The Bush administration supports the measure and so chances are
good that it will be signed into law this year.
   It also has support from civil rights, ethnic and police groups
concerned over what has been portrayed as a rising tide of hate
crimes.
   The bill would require the attorney general to keep statistics
on crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation and
ethnicity. The data would become part of Justice Department uniform
crime reports.
   Under the plan, the department would count murder, non-negligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault,
intimidation, arson and destruction, damage or vandalism of
property.
   The Justice Department said in a May 1988 report that accurate
information about the number of crimes involving bias against
groups is not available.
   ``These types of offenses are far more serious than comparable
crimes that do not involve prejudice because they are intended to
intimidate an entire group,'' the report said.
   Simon told the Senate there have been reports of ``a rising tide
of hate crimes'' by neo-Nazi skinheads and other groups. But he
said some observers also believe the problem is leveling off.
   Unofficial estimates of the cost of gathering the data have
ranged from $1 $1 million to $10 million annually. The department
says there would be little if any difficulty in making ``hate
crimes'' part of the uniform crime reports.
   Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, said after the vote that the ``Senate today sent a
strong signal to the bigots and bashers that violence against
lesbians and gay men is intolerable.''
   The Human Rights Campaign Fund, which describes itself as the
country's largest homosexual lobby, expressed surprise ``at the
overwhelming support shown in the Senate.''
   Helms blasted the bill as ``the flagship of the homosexual and
lesbian legislative agenda,'' citing provisions that require data
on crimes motivated by ``sexual orientation.''
   Sponsors said all such crimes, including ones directed against
homosexuals, should be included in the count. Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, a leading supporter, said he did not condone homosexual
behavior but that he always opposes violent crimes against
individuals.
   ``They're human beings, too, and they ought to be treated like
human beings,'' Hatch said. ``They're citizens of this country and
they ought to be treated like citizens of this country.''
   The Senate overwhelmingly rejected a Helms amendment to express
the nonbinding sense that ``the homosexual movement threatens the
strength and the survival of the American family as a basic unit of
society'' and state sodomy laws ``should be enforced because they
are in the best interest of public health.''
   It also said government ``should not provide discrimination
protections on the basis of sexual orientation'' and ``school
curriculums should not condone homosexuality as an acceptable
lifestyle in American society.''
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., rallied opposition
to the amendment when he said, ``it appears that the need for the
National Hate Crimes Statistics Act has never been greater _ and
that's what this is, a statistics act, it's not about anybody's
behavior.''
   Besides Helms, those voting against the bill were Sens. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; Trent Lott, R-Miss., and William Armstrong,
R-Colo. Not voting were Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Carl
Levin, D-Mich.; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>Durenberger Meets Privately With Ethics Committee</HEAD>

   Sen. Dave Durenberger, defending his financial
dealings before the Senate Ethics Committee, says he told the panel
``some decisions would be made differently'' if he could do it over
again.
   The Minnesota Republican met with the committee privately for an
hour Thursday afternoon at his request.
   Although questions about Durenberger's conduct are still
emerging, the senator told reporters afterward: ``The cloud of
questions that has been hanging over my head since my 1988
re-election campaign has finally started to clear today. ... I have
had the opportunity to address the issues in the proper forum, the
Senate Ethics Committee.''
   He refused to answer questions from reporters after reading a
brief statement.
   Durenberger said he told the panel he received approval from
``the appropriate, official bodies'' for a book promotion
arrangement that netted $100,000 in speaking fees and for rent that
he charged the Senate for staying in his Minneapolis condominium.
   Durenberger previously said the Federal Election Commission
approved his book promotion agreement and the Senate Rules and
Ethics committees sanctioned the reimbursement he received for the
condominium.
   The committee is investigating Durenberger to determine if he
should answer charges in the panel's equivalent of a trial. The
committee gave no indication when it would finish its
investigation, said a Durenberger aide.
   The questions are whether Durenberger broke Senate rules by
evading outside income limits when he made promotional speeches for
the books; improperly charged the Senate for the condominium stays;
and received improper reimbursements for trips to Boston that
combined official appearances with visits to his marriage counselor.
   The rules committee found last month Durenberger improperly
claimed reimbursement for staying in his condominium when the
Senate was out of session, and Durenberger repaid the Senate
$11,005.
   The committee said there were other unspecified questions about
the deal that the ethics committee would have to answer.
   Durenberger, who is up for re-election in 1994, has apologized
to Minnesotans for what he says were mistakes in judgment. Still,
more than two-thirds of respondents in two recent Minnesota polls
said he should resign if the committee finds significant wrongdoing.
   ``I have accepted full responsibility for my actions, and I have
acknowledged that had I to do it all over again, some decisions
would be made differently,'' Durenberger said Thursday.
   Accompanied by his lawyer, Jim Hamilton, and an aide,
Durenberger made a ``lengthy presentation'' that took up much of
the hour-long appearance before the committee Thursday, said his
press secretary, Carrie Collins.
   Meanwhile, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis disclosed Wednesday
that Durenberger obtained $1.3 million in low-interest, unsecured
loans from a Minnesota bank where his cousin is a vice president.
Many of the loans were at interest rates several points below prime
lending rates.
   Durenberger said the story was a ``blatant distortion of the
facts.''
   He said his loans were based on a ``normal, longstanding
relationship'' with the bank. But neither he nor his staff have
attempted to explain why he did not disclose three of the 23 loans
to the Senate, including a short-term $484,000 loan he obtained in
1988.
   ``I guess I would say we're looking into that,'' Collins said.
   Senate disclosure reports require the listing of any liabilities
exceeding $10,000.
   Minnesota Republican Chairman Bob Weinholzer said Thursday that
he expected state Democrats to increase pressure for Durenberger to
resign because Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich could appoint a senator
from his party to serve until an election.
   Weinholzer said Durenberger told him last week ``he has
absolutely no intentions of resigning unless something major comes
along in an ethics committee report.''
   In April 1988, the ethics committee criticized Durenberger for
discussing an espionage case in public the previous year, but it
did not recommend disciplinary action.

   The dollar lost ground against the yen Friday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply.
   The dollar closed at 144.72 yen, down 0.78 yen from Thursday's
close of 145.50 yen. It opened at 145.08 yen and ranged between
144.65 yen and 145.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 214.37-point
gainer Thursday, fell 228.10 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at
37,288.14.
   Talk of a possible rise in the Bank of Japan's discount rate
after the Feb. 18 elections for the lower house of parliament
depressed stock prices, dealers said.
   Share trading has been light this week in anticipation of the
election, and activity was calmer still Friday morning ahead of the
three-day weekend, traders said.
   Both the stock and currency markets will be closed Monday for a
national holiday.
   Currency dealers said the foreign exchange market was calm
throughout the morning. The U.S. currency's lower start in Tokyo
followed its downswing overnight in New York, where it closed at
145.32 yen, down from 145.60 yen.
   Although the dollar slipped against the yen, it strengthened
against the West German mark as market players sold the mark for
profit-taking and position adjustments from their long, or
overbought, positions, a Bank of Tokyo trader said.
   ``The yen is getting slightly stronger against the dollar as
investors buy the ye against the mark,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Concerns about the implications of a proposal to unify the two
German monetary systems, along with profit-taking, helped push the
mark lower Thursday, traders said.

   A 3-foot alligator was returned to the

elementary school for an aborted show-and-tell session.
   The gator, found by 11-year-old Bradley Schlomer in his yard,
was ordered removed from the classroom and sent home by the
principal, then freed Wednesday by an animal control officer.
   Carol Joiner, a school secretary at Rosewood Elementary, said
she knew just what to do when she saw the gator that had been

   ``Last week, it was a baby coral snake,'' she said. ``They put
it in a little tin box and drove up to school. And I called the
mother to tell her to come back and pick up the snake and she says,
`What snake?'''
   Bradley's mother, Sheri Schlomer, said she was unaware that her

   ``I didn't know anything about it until today,'' she said. ``The

<HEAD>`Sacred' Rice Paddies Chosen for Imperial Ascension Ceremony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Imperial Palace has chosen two paddies where
``sacred'' rice will be grown for a ritual that marks Emperor
Akihito's first communion with the gods, a mystical part of his
ascension to the throne.
   The ancient selection ceremony was criticized by several
Christian, academic and leftist groups, which say state backing of
the communion rite violates Japan's constitution.
   Imperial ritualists dressed in flowing robes and black headgear
gathered at three palace shrines Thursday morning, and divined
auspicious locations for the paddies by burning sea turtle shells
over charcoal.
   An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which manages
palace affairs, said northeastern Akita prefecture, or state and
western Oita prefecture were chosen.
   Because of security concerns, the exact location of the paddies
is not expected to be announced until the rice is harvested in
September.
   Police fear attacks by radical leftist groups, which have
announced they intend to disrupt Akihito's coronation in November,
nearly two years after he actually became emperor on the death of
his father, Emperor Hirohito. The leftist Middle Core Faction
claimed responsibility for launching projectiles at the home of
Akihito's younger brother last month.
   By tradition, one paddy must be to the east and one to the west
of Kyoto, Japan's former capital. The rice must go through an
elaborate purification process before being used in the Daijosai,
or Great Food Offering Ritual, to be held after the lavish
coronation ceremonies.
   During the nightlong ritual, tradition holds that a new emperor
has his first communion with the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion.
   Banquets will be held for two nights after the rite, and the
government has said about 1,000 dignitaries will be invited.
   In the last such ceremony in 1928, Hirohito offered rice to the
gods at two shrines in Kyoto. Akihito's Daijosai ceremony will be
held on the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, but government
officials say it will otherwise follow the example set by Hirohito.
   The palace's respect for precedent has led to criticism from
several groups that claim the ceremony is a remnant of Japan's
prewar emperor-centric nationalism.
   ``They have thrown themselves back into the world of myth,''
said Tsutomu Moriyama, a spokesman for the National Christian
Council, an umbrella group for Christians in Japan. ``From the
constitutional viewpoint, these preparations to deify the emperor
are unforgivable.''
   ``It is clear that the government, in planning the Daijosai, has
ignored the principle that sovereignity lies with the people and
not the emperor. ... The rites violate the constitution,'' said a
statement issued by the Historical Studies Association, a
nationwide group of historians and college professors.
   At the urging of U.S.-led occupation authorities, Hirohito
renounced imperial divinity soon after World War II. The current
constitution omits references to the old god-emperor concept, and
strips Shinto of its official status. The postwar constitution also
guarantees the separation of religion and state.
   A government committee recently released a report saying that
although the Daijosai has strong religious overtones, it ``is
public in nature'' and is ``extremely important'' as part of
Japanese culture.
   The government has budgeted more than $58 million for Akihito's
coronation and the ceremony.
   Preparations for the coronation had to await a one-year mourning
period after Hirohito's death of cancer on Jan. 7, 1989. Hirohito
was 87.

<HEAD>Lawmakers See More Concessions Before South Africa Sanctions
Lifted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several lawmakers say sanctions that have
damaged South Africa's economy probably won't be repealed until
Pretoria's white government makes further concessions to the black
majority.
   But a top administration official, speaking Wednesday on
condition he not be identified, said South Africa is likely to make
enough progress in easing oppression against blacks over the next
year to permit the lifting of sanctions.
   ``This is a time when the United States can do the most good by
waiting and watching,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the former
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who supported
sanctions initially.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk's reforms, ``important as
they are, do not meet all the conditions required to build the
appropriate pre-negotiations climate,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Africa subcommittee.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said he continues to oppose sanctions which he thinks
have hurt black South Africans more than the whites.
   But he predicted the sanctions will not be changed ``until a lot
more has been accomplished'' because of a pro-sanctions climate in
Congress.
   The sanctions debate is likely to become more intense if de
Klerk continues to announce reforms in the white-ruled country.
   President Bush has said ``it is certainly time to review all
policy'' when ``people move in the right direction.''
   In general, there is agreement the sanctions Congress imposed in
1986 over President Reagan's veto harmed the country's economy and
took a psychological toll on the white minority.
   Stephen R. Lewis Jr., author of ``The Economics of Apartheid,''
said, ``International trade sanctions alone have probably resulted
in a $2 billion loss annually to the South African economy.''
   But Lewis, president of Carlton College in Northfield, Minn.,
said U.S. sanctions were probably more of a blow psychologically
because the United States has little economic leverage over the
country.
   All told, there are about 123 American companies doing business
in South Africa, employing roughly 1 percent of the populations.
   ``The political significance (of sanctions) was very
substantial,'' said Lewis, saying it meant the South African
government ``could no longer kid itself the United States would
come down on its side.''
   But Michael Johns said that although sanctions increased
pressure on the government, they should be ended now to boost the
nation's economy and ease pressure on de Klerk's government from
blacks and right-wing white groups.
   Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a lobbying group that
encouraged sanctions, said they ``have had more impact than any
previous or current pressure.''
   South Africa's economy is weak because of a combination of
factors, he said, including an international oil boycott, other
countries' restrictions and the inefficiencies of apartheid.
   South Africa's economy has grown at less than 2 percent annually
in recent years, compared with about 5 percent between 1950-1970,
Lewis said.
   ``They finally made an impact on whites,'' said Pauline Baker of
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank. ``The
economy was in irreversible decline.''
   U.S. sanctions barred new American investment in South Africa,
including bank loans to the government; prohibited the import of
South African iron, steel, coal and uranium and agricultural
products, including sugar; prevented the United States from
exporting computers to South Africa; banned all nuclear trade and
halted landings by South African Airways.
   Last week, de Klerk legalized the African National Congress
after three decades of guerrilla war against white rule, and said
he would soon free Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader imprisoned in
1962.

   Where was President Bush the week the
Kremlin tottered?
   He was at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command flashing
a jaunty thumbs-up from the Darth Vaderesque cockpit of a B-1
bomber and reminding missile launch crews ``the pointy end is up.''
   He was out on the dusty hills of the Mojave Desert in fatigues
and black wingtip shoes, watching Army tanks stage war games
against a Soviet-style ``foe.'' No shells; laser tag does the trick.
   He was at a weapons laboratory with a $1 billion budget outside
San Francisco, extolling Star Wars and saluting the
``underappreciated'' staff dreaming up the weapons of tomorrow.
   It was, as wags along for the ride put it, President Bush's Cold
War Victory Tour.
   Communist party chieftains in Moscow may have been talking
pluralism, but for Bush this was a week to celebrate containment,
deterrence and nuclear modernization.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bush also tried to talk in San Francisco about
``demobilization,'' but a memory lapse got in the way.
   After explaining foreign policy to 2,500 people at the
Commonwealth Club, Bush found himself at a loss for that one
particular word while fielding questions.
   Bush allowed that there might be a bit of a dividend down the
road from troop cutbacks in Europe.
   ``I think we will see substantial savings that are made by the _
whaddaya call it? Suddenly gone blank _ in terms of where you bring
a guy back and he's no longer in the Army?'' Bush circumlocuted as
the crowd broke into laughter.
   He never came up with the word.
   Later, aboard Air Force One, he chided reporters, ``None of you
guys gave me any help. I looked down in the front and not one of
you guys would help out. It's not going to impede your
objectivity.''
   ``I was groping up there, a terrible feeling. It was awful. Such
an easy word,'' said Bush. ``Anyway, I made another mistake (once).
Let's see, it was in 1981 ... a spelling error.''
   It wasn't just the press row that failed to help him fill in the
blank. He didn't get any help, either, from former Secretary of
State George Shultz, seated at his right hand, or California Gov.
George Deukmejian a few seats down the head table.

   Bob Hope, preceding Bush at a Los Angeles fund-raising dinner,
marveled at the president's energy.
   ``I mean, he jogs, he swims, he plays tennis, he hunts, he
pitches horseshoes _ he's got to move. I think we ought to let him
deliver the mail,'' quipped Hope.
   But Bush showed signs of tiring on this trip to California,
Nebraska and Ohio and back in 60 hours flat.
   At a fundraising breakfast in Omaha for Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr,
he wound up telling an anecdote about humorist ``Mark Train'' and
thanked the crowd ``for your support for Fay.''

   Bush was only too happy to pose for the camera in his aviator
jacket in the cockpit of a B-1 bomber at Offut, but he kept his
feet planted firmly on the ground when surrounded by tanks and
armored vehicles during the military training exercises at Fort
Irwin, a remote installation in the Mojave.
   He got close but never ventured inside, mindful of the comic
picture that Michael Dukakis, his campaign rival, cut when he took
an ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign.

   Bush tries to walk a fine line between voicing support for
Gorbachev's reform efforts and trying to keep his nose out of the
other guy's internal business.
   Many of the questions from the Commonwealth Club crowd dealt
with Gorbachev. But one apparently was too much for Bush. Would he
comment, please, on Gorbachev's nomination for the Nobel Peace
Prize?
   ``I hate to say I wasn't aware of it,'' he cracked. But after
dancing around a bit, he added, ``Far be it from me to try to
influence the gurus who decide who wins a Nobel Prize.''

   Three slayings and a suspected suicide at the
top-secret Trident submarine base have raised questions of
espionage and complaints that the Navy has not conducted a complete
investigation.
   The intrigue is focused on a 23-year-old submarine technician
named Shyam David Drizpaul, whose body was found last month in a
Vancouver-area motel, about 180 miles south of the Bangor Trident
submarine base.
   Navy investigators say they believe Drizpaul killed two fellow
submariners in the Bangor base's barracks, then killed a woman and
wounded a man during a pawn-shop robbery in nearby Bremerton.
   They claim Drizpaul then drove to the motel and killed himself.
   But a lawyer for Drizpaul's family, family members and even a
shipmate said the Navy's story doesn't make sense.
   Attorney Larry Scruggs Jr. of Milwaukee, who traveled to the
base to investigate the shootings, noted that Drizpaul had a
sensitive position, working on the weapons systems, aboard the USS
Michigan; that Drizpaul was a computer whiz and his personal
computer is missing; and that he was killed by a single bullet
through his forehead, which he said was unusual for a suicide.
   Scruggs also said he has evidence of another person being
involved in the plot, but he would give no details _ not even the
person's gender.
   ``I think he was either murdered or compelled to do those
things,'' Scruggs said of the slayings. ``... Drizpaul had high
clearance, and my indication was that clearance was extremely high,
extremely critical.''
   ``Maybe the thing fell apart and people began to panic and
couldn't accept the results. ... There is one person who can answer
those questions,'' he said, referring to the other individual.
   Drizpaul's relatives in Milwaukee said Drizpaul was an
intelligent and responsible person who did not fit the description
of a killer.
   ``Nothing makes sense. There are a lot of questions that haven't
been answered,'' said an uncle, Yoganand Kumar. ``What's going on?
What are they trying to cover up? We're not saying he didn't do it.
We're saying, `Tell us what happened.'''
   At Drizpaul's funeral last month, Petty Officer Paul Gamache of
Osseo, Wis., who escorted Drizpaul's body from Washington to
Milwaukee, told mourners that Drizpaul's co-workers were surprised
by the allegations.
   Gamache, who knew Drizpaul for 18 months, said the Navy's
allegations about Drizpaul did not ``really seem like the guy we
knew. ... He always performed every job ever asked of him in a very
professional manner. He took pride in his work.''
   Scruggs said the circumstances around the shootings of two
sailors in a Bangor barrack were unusual. The sailors _ identified
as David Allen Parker, 21, of San Diego, and 18-year-old Scott
Anthony Seely, of North Ridgeville, Ohio _ had been shot in the
head, and were found about fifteen feet apart, he said.
   Whoever was shot second would have heard the first gunshot, but
investigators found no signs of trauma or struggle in either
victim, Scruggs said.
   Sometime after the shooting, Bangor gate guards detained
Drizpaul for driving while intoxicated and took from him a 9mm
automatic pistol.
   Navy ballistics reports should confirm next week whether that
gun killed Parker and Seely, said Banger spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Keith
Arterburn.
   The Navy has refused to respond to Scruggs' questions.
   Allan Michaels, 28, identified Drizpaul from photographs as the
man who wounded him and fatally shot his sister, Julie Lynn
Tuscher, 24, in the pawn shop where they worked. ``I don't know how
much clearer that can be,'' Arterburn said.
   But Scruggs said Michael's identification was too detailed.
   ``He described him exactly the same way it was printed in the
newspaper _ neatly trimmed mustache. Give me a break.''
   The morning after the sailors were shot, police and Navy
authorities said Drizpaul allegedly drove to Bremerton in one of
the dead sailor's cars and shot Tuscher and Michaels while trying
to take another gun.
   Arterburn said 35 investigators are still working on the case.
   The Drizpaul incident is the latest of several deaths close to
the base. Two Navy servicemen committed suicide in the last 13
months and one crewman faces charges of killing an elderly couple
north of Seattle.
   The shootings have raised questions about the Navy's training.
   Arterburn said all submarine crew members undergo psychological
testing before being assigned to duty. He also said those who work
around nuclear weapons are monitored by the Defense Department.
   ``We all believe this to be a real tragedy,'' Arterburn said of
the string of shootings. ``We've lost shipmates. It's one of those
things that shocks you, but you have to keep on.''

   Condoms should be distributed free to young users
of crack cocaine, say researchers who found that many such youths
sell sex for drugs or engage in sexual practices that increase
their risk of catching AIDS.
   The researchers reported in today's Jornal of American Medical
Association that 76 percent of the subjects in their study ``were
worried' or ``somehwat worried'' about catching HIV, the AIDS virus.
   The researchers viewed the degree of worry by the respondents as
positive.
   ``The kids were worried about contracting AIDS. Some AIDS
education has gotten through,'' said Robert Fullilove, who led a
team of researchers that questioned 222 young black crack users in
San Francisco and Oakland, Calif.
   Fullilove said that he and his colleagues recommended a campaign
of widespread distribution of condoms that might make it possible
``for even the worried, implusive crack user to have safe sexual
encounters.''
   ``Crack is such a deadly thing, (many people think) the only
thing you can do is watch the community commit suicide,'' Fullilove
said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``We don't see it that way
at all.''
   Three-fourths of the admitted crack users, ages 13 to 19, said
they engaged in sexual practices that increased their risk of
catching HIV, the researchers said.
   Fifty-five youths, or 25 percent, reported exchanging sex for
money or drugs, a practice equally common among boys and girls, the
researchers found.
   Other alarming trends among the 140 boys and 82 girls surveyed
were:
   _Just 59 percent reported ever using a condom, and just 23
percent said they had used a condom in their most recent sexual
encounter.
   _Twenty-seven percent of boys and 4 percent of girls said they
had more than 10 sexual partners during the previous year.
   _Forty-one percent had a history of sexually transmitted
diseases, mostly gonorrhea.
   _Fifty-one percent said they had engaged in sex while under the
influence of crack.
   _Twenty-nine percent said the following statement was true of
them: ``I don't usually know ahead of time if I'm going to have sex
_ it just happens.''
   Fullilove conceded the distribution of condoms is not a panacea
to the spread of AIDS.
   ``Obviously, it would work best in a much more comprehensive
program teaching everything from `be responsible' to `this drug
(crack) is dangerous,''' he said.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops is opposed to
distributing condoms. In a statement issued in November the bishops
said condoms were technically unreliable and fostered ``a false
sense of security that actually leads to a greater spread of
disease.''
   Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for Los Angeles Archbishop
Roger Mahony, who led the bishops' Ad Hoc Committee on the AIDS
statement, said Thursday, ``This notion of safe sex is a myth. It's
a fraud.''
   Besides encouraging sexual encounters that are immoral, Coiro
said, the failure rate of condoms can be as high as 50 percent in
anal intercourse, one of the main ways the disease spreads.
   Crack use, coupled with exchanging sex for the drug, has been
cited as a factor in the recent increase in sexually transmitted
disease oberved in many U.S. urban areas, according to Fullilove,
who led the study for the University of California at San
Francisco's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies.
   Subjects for the study were questioned by interviewers who were
familiar with drug dealers and users in known areas of crack
activity, the researchers said.
   The interviewers went to those neighborhoods and questioned
youths who approached them either requesting or offering a sale of
crack, a highly potent, smokable form of cocaine that is both
inexpensive and highly addictive.

<HEAD>Proposal to Protect Uranium Miners Was Ignored, Says Scientist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and mining industry rejected a
safety proposal in the early 1950s that would have protected
uranium miners from lung cancer and other respiratory diseases,
says a former government scientist.
   The Atomic Energy Commission ``disclaimed responsibility. They
were not responsible for radiation protection until after the ore
reached the mills,'' Dr. Victor E. Archer told the Senate Committee
on Labor and Human Resources.
   ``The mine operators rejected it because it would cost them too
much to ventilate (the mines),'' he said. ``The states reflected
the mine operators' opinion, pointing out that they had no
expertise in radiation safety and no money for extra mine
inspectors.''
   He said all three groups ``justified their inaction by arguing
that it was not clear that there was a radiation hazard in U.S.
mines'' despite high levels measured in U.S. mines and the lung
cancer experience of miners in Central Europe.
   Archer, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Public Health Service in
Utah in the 1950s, said the safety proposal came from Duncan
Holaday, an industrial hygiene engineer with the health service.
   Holaday proposed in 1952 and 1953 that a maximum radon exposure
limit be set and that it be enforced through mine ventilation,
Archer said.
   The safety measures would have cost a nickel per pound of
uranium, he said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has written legislation that would
compensate victims of radiation exposure through uranium mining
from 1947-1971 or above-ground nuclear tests at the Nevada test
site in the 1950s and '60s.
   ``The level of their exposure was, in large part, due to the
government's unconscionable failure to properly care for or warn
these victims,'' Hatch said.
   Uranium mines are located in New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah and
Colorado.
   Full protection began only when federal authorities took over
regulation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
in 1971 and the Mine Safety and Health Administration six years
later, Archer said.
   Hatch said legislation, which would create a $100 million trust
fund, is necessary because courts have rejected individual claims
on the grounds of government exemption from liability.
   Hatch said he expected the full committee to complete action on
the bill when it meets Feb. 28.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, has filed similar legislation in the
House. He said he expected the House to complete action within six
weeks.
   The government carried out more than 100 above-ground tests at
the Nevada Test Site between 1951 and 1958, according to Hatch's
office.

<HEAD>Judge Says He Won't Consider National Security in Diary Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he won't consider
national security and diplomatic implications in deciding whether
former President Reagan should turn over some 33 diary excerpts to
John Poindexter.
   Reagan invoked executive privilege Monday in an attempt to avoid
supplying the diaries to his former national security adviser, who
is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20 on charges of conspiracy,
obstructing Congress and making false statements in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   However, the Bush administration did not join in Reagan's move.
   ``The privilege relating to national security, foreign affairs
and burdensomeness considerations is that of the incumbent, rather
than the former president,'' U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said in a five-page order Thursday.
   ``In the absence of a claim of executive privilege by the
incumbent president the interests of the current presidency will
not receive the benefit of the higher standard of review,'' Greene
wrote.
   Reagan's claim to executive privilege is based on ``the
constitutionally protected privacy of his diaries,'' his lawyers
said Monday.
   The Justice Department said Wednesday that it would review
secret proffers that Poindexter has submitted to the court before
the Bush administration decides whether to claim executive
privilege.
   Greene ordered that three such court filings by Poindexter be
turned over to Reagan and the Justice Department by Friday.
   They include a June 12 filing seeking classified material and a
Sept. 18 statement seeking permission to obtain material from
Reagan and President Bush. The third document is a Jan. 8 memo by
Poindexter explaining why documents subpoenaed from Reagan are
important to his defense.
   Greene ordered Poindexter to supply the secret court filings so
that Reagan and the Justice Department can respond to Poindexter's
demands for documents. The judge said in December that he would
follow such a procedure if executive privilege were invoked.
   In the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ordered President
Nixon to produce White House tape recordings he had been trying to
shield. Invoking executive privilege, Nixon said confidential
conversations between a president and his close advisers should not
be disclosed.
   But the Supreme Court said a ``generalized interest in
confidentiality ... cannot prevail over the ... fair administration
of criminal justice.''

   A judge said he may reverse himself and permit
Joseph Hazelwood's defense to allege that government negligence _
not recklessness by the Exxon Valdez captain _ caused the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone reopened the question after
he had ruled Thursday that such a theory could not be advanced by
the defense.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson said in his opening statement that
the U.S. Coast Guard monitors weren't watching their radar screen
and failed in their duty to notify Hazelwood that his 987-foot
tanker was heading for disaster at Bligh Reef.
   A Coast Guard traffic monitor, civilian employee Gregory Taylor,
testified Thursday that part of his job was to watch the radar
screen for trouble and communicate with tankers if a problem was
imminent. He also said he was to ``let people know what was going
on to make things easier.''
   He said he spoke with Hazelwood some time before the Exxon
Valdez disaster and discussed ice conditions in the Valdez Narrows.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating
a vessel while intoxicated. If convicted, he faces up to seven
years and three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Most of the testimony in Hazelwood's week-old trial has focused
on whether the captain was drunk when the Exxon Valdez ran aground
early March 24. The spill spewed more than 10 million gallons of
North Slope crude, killing thousands of birds, fish and other
wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline.
   Taylor and another traffic monitor have said the Exxon Valdez
was in a hazy area at the edge of their radar monitor and may not
have been visible before it smashed into a rocky reef.
   Johnstone initially ruled the defense couldn't use a theory of
government negligence, but later said he may reverse himself.
   ``What the defense seems to be saying,'' Johnstone said, ``is,
`We're not reckless. We didn't create the problem. The government
created the problem.' The more I think about it the more I think
the defense should be able to show they didn't create it; the
government did. I'm reconsidering it.''
   The prosecution, which says the accident was all Hazelwood's
fault, tried to block such testimony, saying if Hazelwood wanted to
claim he was not reckless he could testify on his behalf.
   Johnstone suggested this might force the defendant to testify
when he would not otherwise do so.
   In another ruling, Johnstone decided that jurors will not be
told that Taylor, the Coast Guard monitor, tested positive for
marijuana two days after the grounding. He did not immediately rule
on whether a second monitor's alcohol test would be admitted in
evidence.
   ``I find the inquiry about this marijuana has nil probative
value and is far outweighed by the invasion of Mr. Taylor's
privacy,'' Johnstone said. ``In other words, it's a red herring.''
   Documents filed in the case showed that Bruce Blandford, the
second traffic monitor, showed a blood-alcohol level of .203
percent 15 hours after the tanker went aground. Assistant District
Attorney Brent Cole said Blandford went home after the accident and
began drinking.
   ``There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Blandford was under
the influence of intoxicating liquor at any time during his
shift,''' said Cole, who conceded that in a later test Blandford
also showed a trace of morphine in his urine.
   He said there was no evidence Taylor was under the influence of
marijuana the night of the crash. Traces of marijuana can remain in
the bloodstream months after its use.

<HEAD>Interior Considering Taking Bald Eagle Off Endangered List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials say the effort to save
the American bald eagle from extinction has been so successful that
the national symbol may be taken off the endangered list.
   The eagle, which was threatened with extinction in the 1960s
partly because of contamination from the pesticide DDT, would
remain under protection of federal law, but its status would be
lowered, officials said Thursday.
   ``We are not considering removing the bald eagle from the
protection of the Endangered Species Act,'' said John Turner,
director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Turner said the agency was gathering additional data on eagle
populations before making a formal recommendation to the Interior
Department to lower the status of the eagle from endangered to
threatened.
   But the proposal has raised concerns among some
environmentalists.
   ``The improvements in eagle numbers may be only temporary
because eagle habitat is still being destroyed at an unprecedented
rate,'' said M. Rupert Cutler, president of Defenders of Wildlife.
   Cutler said in some parts of the country, such as the Great
Lakes area and some coastal areas, the eagle remains in danger
because of pesticides and toxins, and development is eating up
eagle territory elsewhere.
   The American eagle was placed under protection of federal law in
1967 after its population had been declining since the 1940s,
largely because the widespread use of the pesticide DDT interfered
in its reproductive process.
   The Environmental Protection Agency ordered a halt to the use of
DDT in 1972.
   From an estimated low, not counting birds in Alaska, of only 400
nesting pairs in the early 1960s, their number increased to more
than 2,660 nesting pairs in 1989, the Interior Department said.
   Turner said four of the five government recovery programs in the
country are showing eagle population figures that exceed numbers
that would warrant reducing the status of the bird from endangered
to threatened.
   The bald eagle is listed as endangered in 43 states and
threatened in five others. The bald eagle is not under federal
protection in Alaska where the population is thriving with more
than 30,000 birds.
   Turner said his agency would review the bald eagle population
figures when the latest data comes in before making a determination
whether to lower its status to threatened in the 43 states.

<HEAD>North Korea Refuses Talks With South Korea During U.S. Military
Exercises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea today declared it would
boycott talks with South Korea during U.S.-South Korean military
exercises in the spring, the official North Korean news agency
reported.
   The annual Team Spirit exercises, which began last month,
involve about 200,000 troops. The announcement marked North Korea's
fourth consecutive suspension of talks during the exercises.
   North Korean representatives to three sets of talks declared in
a statement that they would not negotiate with South Korea during
the ``aggressive'' exercises, said the Korean Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo.
   In the statement, North called the Team Spirit practice ``open
treachery'' and ``an anti-national criminal act of breaking up
dialogue and obstructing reunification,'' the news agency said.
   ``If the United States wants detente and peace on the Korean
peninsula and North-South dialogue, it must immediately discontinue
the Team Spirit '90 joint military exercises and promptly withdraw
all their troops and military equipment hurled into South Korea for
the military exercises,'' the statement said.
   Despite a common heritage, language and even a strong desire to
unite, talks between the two Koreas constantly founder.
   Earlier this week, talks aimed at fielding a joint team for this
year's Asian Games in Beijing broke down after 10 months when both
sides differed over procedural matters after agreeing on most major
issues.
   The two Koreas have been enemies since the division of the
peninsula in 1945. In the early 1950s, they fought each other in
the Korean War which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Technically, they remain at war and the border between them is one
of the most heavily fortified in the world.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty. On Jan. 30, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney announced the closing of three U.S. air bases in South Korea
and withdrawal of 2,000 support personnel.

   Americans and Colombians disagree on whether
the Colombian government is winning its war against drug cartels,
while Colombians are suspicious the United States is using the drug
problem to control their government, a poll shows.
   Fifty-eight percent of Colombians but only 25 percent of
Americans said the Colombian government is winning its war against
the drug cartels of that country, according to the poll by The
Washington Post and ABC News. Seventy percent of Americans, but 19
percent of Colombians, said the Colombian government is losing, the
poll showed.
   The poll asked several questions of 1,008 American adults and
1,022 Colombian adults between Jan. 20 and Jan. 29. ABC's ``World
News Tonight'' on Thursday and today's editions of the newspaper
carried reports on the results.
   A majority of Americans _ 55 percent _ favored sending U.S.
troops to help the Colombian military, and 45 percent were opposed.
Only 19 percent of Colombians favored such a course and 77 percent
were opposed.
   There was some agreement: 79 percent of Americans and 80 percent
of Colombians said the international drug problem was caused by
demand in the United States while only 19 percent of Americans and
9 percent of Colombians said it was caused by Colombia allowing
traffickers to operate.
   Fifty-one percent of Americans and 57 percent of Colombians
favored U.S. aid to the police and judicial system of Colombia; 47
percent of Americans and 39 percent of Colombians opposed it.
   Questions asked only in Colombia showed great suspicion of the
United States.
   Sixty-five percent said they were suspicious that the United
States was using the drug problem to control the Colombian
government. Forty-nine percent said their government should not
work with the United States while only 40 percent said it should.
   Asked whether their government should accept offers of the drug
kingpins to wind up the traffic and end the violence if given
amnesty and allowed to keep their property, 58 percent of
Colombians said the government should agree while 31 percent said
it should not.
   The government has not responded to that offer.
   The margin of error was said to be four percentage points in
each sample.

<HEAD>Peer Who Organized Prince Charles And Diana's Wedding Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Maclean, the former chief official of Queen
Elizabeth II's household and organizer of the 1981 wedding of
Prince Charles, has died, his family announced today. He was 73.
   Maclean died Thursday at Hampton Court Palace, a former royal
residence in London, where he had been chief steward since 1985.
The announcement gave no cause of death.
   The Scottish baron became lord chamberlain in 1971. Before he
retired from the post in 1984, he had established a reputation as a
perfectionist in royal ceremonies while overseeing the queen's
household.
   The wedding of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son, and Lady
Diana Spencer in St. Paul's Cathedral was a highlight of his term.
   In a spontaneous gesture, Princess Diana kissed him before a
train carried the newlyweds away on their honeymoon.
   Maclean served as a Scots Guards infantry officer in World War
II, fighting in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. After
the war, he became a sheep and cattle farmer.
   In 1959, he became leader of the Boy Scouts in Britain and the
Commonwealth. He went on to revolutionize the staid image of the
movement founded by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908, adding sports such
as gliding and cave diving to traditional scouting activities. He
retired as chief scout in 1975.
   Maclean's first ceremonial assignment as lord chamberlain was
the 1972 funeral of the Duke of Windsor, who as King Edward VIII
abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis
Simpson.
   The assignment was difficult because of the bad feeling
engendered by the abdication among other members of the royal
family. But Maclean was judged to have handled the funeral
arrangements with great skill.
   Royalty watchers noted with approval that Maclean did not bow
when he said farewell to the duke's widow as she left.
   Maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of Queen
Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, that year.
   His job as lord chamberlain sometimes involved odd
responsibilities. He once had to advise the queen whether she
should keep her centuries-old legal right to possession of every
whale and sturgeon washed up on the British coast. After some
deliberation, Maclean advised her to renounce it, saying it might
prove a nuisance.
   There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.
   He is survived by his wife and their son and daughter.

   Theatergoers said they were cheated when
the cast of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' was forced to cover up what it's been
showing off for 20 years.
   Actors wore bras, flesh-colored underwear and G-strings during
Wednesday night's show, their first clad performance since the show
opened in June 1969. It has been seen by about 5,000 audiences
since then.
   ``We've never had this problem before,'' said producer Barry
Singer. ``There's nothing perverse about it. Go-go girls are much
more sexually oriented than our show.''
   Officials insisted the actors cover up in the show at the Shrine
Mosque. State regulations prohibit nudity in a place of business
licensed to sell liquor, even though the bar was closed at
Wednesday's performance.
   ``I had a feeling I got cheated. It was like going to a musical
where they didn't sing,'' said theatergoer Larry Welburn, 36.

<BYLINE>AIDS: Spread Has Slowed _ But Not for All Groups</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

   AIDS spread at its slowest rate in the United
States last year as fewer homosexual and bisexual men developed the
disease and drugs delayed symptoms in people already infected,
federal officials said.
   But AIDS is spreading faster among heterosexuals, newborn
babies, women and Southerners, the federal Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The CDC reported 35,238 new cases of AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, in 1989, compared with 32,196 in 1988.
   That 9 percent increase is easily the slowest since the AIDS
spread began in early 1981. For example, AIDS was up 34 percent in
1988 and 60 percent in 1987.
   ``This is somewhat of a continuing trend,'' said Dr. Ruth
Berkelman, chief of AIDS surveillance for the Atlanta-based CDC.
   Of the new AIDS cases reported last year, 56 percent were among
homosexual and bisexual males. But the cases among gay and bisexual
men were up just 8 percent over 1988 levels, while
heterosexual-contact cases _ just 4 percent of the total _ were up
27 percent over the year before.
   ``I think the leveling off reflects both a reduction in the
number of new infections among homosexual and bisexual men, and
also the introduction of some effective therapies (such as the drug
AZT) in 1987, delaying the onset of AIDS itself among infected
persons,'' Ms. Berkelman said.
   In 1989, 547 cases of AIDS transmission from mothers to newborns
were reported, up 17 percent from 1988. And while females made up
just 3,931 of the 35,238 cases last year, that was an increase of
11 percent over 1988; the number of AIDS cases among males last
year was up 9 percent from the preceding year.
   Other larger proportional increases occurred in the South, up 22
percent over 1988; in population areas of less than 100,000, up 35
percent; and in areas of 100,000 to 500,000 people, up 32 percent.
   Among the regions, the South, with 31 percent, accounted for the
largest proportion of AIDS cases reported, compared with 30 percent
in the Northeast, 24 percent in the West and 10 percent in the
Midwest.
   The number of new AIDS cases in the Northeast dropped 7 percent
last year, to 10,718.
   The majority of 1989 cases _ 70 percent _ occurred in cities of
1 million people or more.
   The number of new AIDS cases among hemophilia patients dropped 5
percent in 1989, from 339 in 1988 to 321. And new cases associated
with blood transfusions dropped 14 percent, from 935 to 808.
   But among intravenous drug users, the second largest group of
AIDS patients, 7,970 new cases were reported in 1989, a 5 percent
increase over 1988.
   Nationwide, the CDC has reported 117,781 cases since AIDS
reporting began in 1981. More than 70,000 of the victims, or 60
percent, have died.
   Sixty percent of AIDS cases have occurred in homosexual or
bisexual men, and 21 percent have occurred among IV drug abusers,
with 7 percent among patients in both categories.

<HEAD>Survey of Low-Income Women Finds Many Anemic in Pregnancy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lower-income mothers don't seem to bounce back
from the anemia common in early pregnancy as well as other women,
and that puts their babies at higher risk of premature delivery and
fetal death, a new report says.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
a 1987 survey of lower-income women showed that 38 percent of
blacks and 19 percent of whites in the third trimester of pregnancy
had hemoglobin levels indicating anemia.
   During the second trimester, 6 percent of white women and 18
percent of black women were anemic. In the first three months of
pregnancy, 4 percent and 13 percent, respectively, were anemic.
   ``Among pregnant women who receive sufficient iron, (hemoglobin)
levels normally decrease early in pregnancy, then increase through
the third trimester'' to near pre-pregnancy levels, the
Atlanta-based CDC said.
   For the women in the low-income survey, ``the failure to attain
pre-pregnancy levels during the third trimester suggests that many
of these women were iron deficient during pregnancy.''
   The survey results mean ``many low-income women have poor iron
nutrition both before and during pregnancy,'' the CDC said.
   Anemia during pregnancy increases a woman's risk of premature
delivery, and increases the child's chances of low birth weight and
fetal death, the CDC said.
   Nationwide, about 5 percent of non-pregnant, childbearing-age
women have anemia, the CDC said.
   The racial differences ``may be related to a greater risk for
iron deficiency in black women,'' the CDC said. But ``the
explanation for the difference observed in this analysis is
unclear.''
   The findings came from the CDC's 1987 Pregnancy Nutrition
Surveillance System, which studied anemia during pregnancy among
more than 68,000 lower-income women in 13 states, most of them
enrolled in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program.

   The Southern California oil spill might have
been avoided if the 811-foot American Trader had been equipped with
a double hull and double bottom, said state officials and shipping
experts.
   A number of officials speculated Thursday that a large swell
caused the American Trader to fall on its own anchor Wednesday,
ripping open a 3-foot hole, while the ship maneuvered alongside an
offshore pipeline.
   ``We've always recommended that this (design change) be looked
at,'' said Peter Douglas, executive director of the state Coastal
Commission. ``If the information is born out that this tanker
lifted up and came down on its own anchor, double-hulling the
vessel may well have prevented the spill.''
   The spill off Huntington Beach brought to a head debate over
requiring the design change on tankers, opposed by many oil
officials because of the higher cost and arguable safety advantages.
   Even some oil industry executives acknowledged that
double-hulling and double-bottoming could have prevented this
spill, a 1985 spill from a grounded Arco tanker in Port Angeles
Harbor, Wash., and the devastating Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska.
   ``The double hull, in this case, could have avoided the spill
and our own spill,'' said Jerry Aspland, president of Arco Marine
Inc. and a former ship captain experienced in offshore moorings.
   But Aspland and Morris Croce, a Chevron USA executive and former
ship captain, said the double-hull, double-bottom construction had
important drawbacks.
   If, for example, a double-hull ship hits rocks at full speed, it
could be more difficult to handle because the extra steel makes for
a bigger, messier hole, They said. The space between the two hulls
can fill with water, making the ship less buoyant.
   ``These considerations have got be addressed before one jumps to
concluding that the double hull, double bottom is the solution to
everything,'' Croce said.
   Several panels are studying the double-bottom, double-hull
issue, including the American Academy of Sciences, which set to
release a report this summer. Many oil companies said they would
strongly consider the academy's findings.
   Mike Murphy, vice president for operations at American Trading
Transportation Co. Inc., operator of the American Trader, was
noncommittal when asked at a news conference Thursday whether a
double hull might have prevented the spill.
   He said that as a shipping company official he had mixed
feelings about the double-hull issue.
   ``The cost is one issue ... but there are other issues,'' he
said, refusing to elaborate.
   The Senate and the House have passed differing oil liability
bills that a conference committee is now blending into a measure
both can approve by the March 24 anniversary of the Exxon Valdez
spill.
   The main sticking point is over double bottoms and double hulls,
which the House wants to see on all tankers calling at U.S. ports
with oil or hazardous materials within seven and 15 years,
respectively. The Senate bill calls for further study, which is the
position the oil industry prefers.
   On Wednesday, the House voted 376-37 to instruct the conferees
to include the hull-bottom provision in the bill. Though
non-binding, the vote was taken to illustrate the strength of
support for the provision in the House.

<HEAD>Dollar Loses Ground Against Yen, Stocks Slide in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground against the yen in Tokyo
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply.
   The dollar closed the week at 144.72 yen, down 0.78 yen from
Thursday's close of 145.50 yen. It opened the day at 145.08 yen and
ranged between 144.65 and 145.15 yen.
   The U.S. currency's lower start in Tokyo followed its downswing
in New York Thursday, where it closed at 145.32 yen.
   Traders sold the West German mark for the yen throughout the day
to take profits on marks, dealers said.
   ``The yen is getting slightly stronger against the dollar as
investors buy the yen against the mark,'' said a dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Concerns about the implications of a proposal to unify the two
German monetary systems, along with profit-taking, helped push the
mark lower, traders said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 214.37 points Thursday, fell 228.10 points, or
0.6 percent, to close at 37,288.14.
   Trading on the market has been light since the beginning of this
week in anticipation of Japan's upcoming parliamentary elections.
   Traders said a lack of trading focus was another element that
has been discouraging buying interest. There also was growing
expectation in the market that the Bank of Japan will raise its
official discount rate soon after the Feb. 18 elections, traders
said.
   Traders said index-linked trading moved the market as most
investors avoided dealing due to concern about the outcome of the
elections, where the governing Liberal Democrats face a possible
loss of their lower house majority. Thin trading makes the market
more vulnerable to index-linked buying, they said.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 350
million shares, the lowest daily volume since last August. An
estimated 430 million shares changed hands on the first section on
Thursday.
   Both the stock and currency markets will be closed Monday for
National Foundation Day, a national holiday.

<HEAD>Command Head: Regional Conflicts Threaten U.S. Interests in
Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Central Command says the
most serious threats to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf are
regional conflicts and the extensive acquisition of weapons by Iran
and Iraq.
   Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf told the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Thursday that although Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease
fire in August 1988, the two countries have never signed a peace
treaty.
   ``This no peace-no war situation has caused both sides to pursue
rearmament programs,'' Schwarzkopf said. ``While each nation is
purchasing more lethal weapons, the balance of power is
dramatically in favor of Iraq.''
   Under questioning from Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services panel, Schwarzkopf said the Soviet Union has been
supplying modern equipment directly to Iraq.
   In addition, ``unbelievable amounts of modern equipment is
flowing into Afghanistan on a monthly basis,'' the commander said.
   Based on this information, the United States has changed its
strategy, altering its military plans for a regional conflict
rather than a Soviet invasion of Iran.
   The Defense Planning Guidance, a classified report the military
leaders use to plan troop levels, weapons purchases and bases for
1992-1997, which was described this week in published reports,
reflects the change that Schwarzkopf described.

   The man who slugged Sen. John Glenn in front
of a television crew has been found innocent by reason of insanity.
   But U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson said Michael Breen, 31, of
Washington, D.C., poses a potential danger to others and must be
hospitalized for what was described in court as ``severe mental
illness.''
   Robinson accepted Breen's plea Thursday after reviewing
psychiatric reports.
   In October, Breen lunged at Glenn, D-Ohio, during an outdoor
television interview and landed a solid right to the jaw. Aside
from redness and a few days of soreness, Glenn, a 68-year-old
ex-Marine, was unharmed.
   According to the criminal complaint filed against him, Breen
told police he was trying to get the attention of Pope John Paul II
and prevent a nuclear war.
   Breen had been detained by U.S. Capitol Police and the Secret
Service a day earlier after breaking through a police line and
trying to reach out to Vice President Dan Quayle's motorcade. Breen
also ``had sought President Bush at the Federal Emergency
Management Agency'' a week earlier, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig

   Iscoe said Breen was responding to instructions he received in

<HEAD>Lawmakers Abandon Proposal To Rename Airport For Eisenhower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas lawmakers say unexpected opposition has
convinced them to drop a proposal to rename Washington Dulles
International Airport after Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Rep. Pat Roberts had planned to introduce a resolution Thursday
asking the regional airport authority to change the name of the
airport located 25 miles west of the nation's capital to Eisenhower
International Airport, to honor Eisenhower in the centennial year
of his birth.
   But the suggestion drew expected opposition from area
businessmen and the family of the late John Foster Dulles, who
served as secretary of state in Eisenhower's administration. It was
an executive order by Eisenhower in 1959 that named the airport
after Dulles.
   ``From the outset, we had no desire whatsoever to take away from
the career of John Foster Dulles or to cause any problem,'' said
Roberts.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., also received criticism
after he introduced a similar resolution shortly after Congress
convened last month.
   The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority operates both
Dulles and National airports.

<HEAD>Squatters Settle Land That Could Be Border Crossing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAPRA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have threatened to remove
hundreds of squatters who have settled in the desert hills hoping
the land will increase in value if and when a border crossing is
built here.
   The government says the squatters, who hope to be reimbursed for
the land by the government if the crossing goes up, have no claim
to the property.
   The population of Anapra has grown from 300 families to 1,000
families in the last three months, since the Mexican government
announced that Anapra was being considered for a new border
crossing to Sunland Park, N.M.
   The towns are adjacent to El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico.
   The crossing has not yet been approved by Mexican and U.S.
officials, but that hasn't stopped the influx.
   ``The rights of those people who have lived in Anapra from the
beginning, 16 years ago, will be protected. They will get title to
their land. But those squatters moving in now will be removed _
forcibly if need be,'' said Jose de Jesus Macias Delgado, the mayor
of Ciudad Juarez.
   Most of the squatters are poor people who have been duped by
leaders of civil and peasant associations, who have encouraged
people to settle the land and are selling titles to it, said
Alfonso Cerpa Roman, the Juarez appraisal director.
   Jesus Antonio Ruiz Dominguez said he paid more than $50 down on
a 900-square-yard lot in Anapra that had a $400 price tag, plus
another $50 for electricity rights and for an engineer to measure
the land.
   ``They told me the money was going to Chihuahua City, where Gov.
Fernando Baeza would give us title to the land,'' he said.

   Bombs exploded at a post office and on a
parked bus today, prompting authorities to tighten security in an
attempt to halt Moslem separatist violence in the northern Kashmir
region.
   No one was hurt or killed in the blasts, but state authorities
later imposed a curfew and banned all public assembly, including
Friday prayer services, forcing tens of thousands of Moslem sabbath
worshipers to stay indoors.
   Moslem militants have been demanding for more than four decades
that Jammu-Kashmir state break away from predominantly Hindu India.
   The latest flareup erupted last month with clashes between
Indian security forces and the militants and at least 82 people
have been killed, officials say.
   A bomb exploded in a bus parked at the city terminal, adjacent
to the tourist information center, officials said. Two other buses
were damaged but no one was hurt, they said.
   Another bomb exploded in a neighborhood post office, but there
were no casualties, said the district magistrate of Srinagar,
Ghulam Abbas.
   Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying a
curfew imposed Jan. 20 by government forces to stem rising violence.
   In recent days, authorities had relaxed the curfew during
daytime hours, but it was re-imposed following the bomb blasts.
   After Moslems were told they would not be allowed to attend
services, the city's chief Moslem priest denounced the decision and
called on Moslem leaders worldwide to force the Indian government
to allow the gatherings.
   ``I strongly condemn the anti-Islamic act of state authorities
to impose day curfew consistently on Fridays for the last two
months to make jumma (Friday) prayers impossible,'' Moulvi Mohammad
Farooq said in a statement.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end
of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding
areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only
predominantly Moslem state.
   Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems,
but nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million
population.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem
population, but now demand independence and the status of a neutral
country.
   India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training
and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says
the Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region.

   Iran rejected U.S. allegations that
pro-Iranian militants planned a terrorist attack in Europe to

   Iran's mission at the United Nations issued a statement late

discredit Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   ``The U.S. authorities know fully well that the allegations have
no foundation whatsoever in reality. They resort to them, however,
trying to justify their illegal policies and behavior as well as
their violations of international law,'' IRNA quoted the statement
as saying.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, gave no other details about
the statement. But it said Iran would bring the issue to the
attention of the U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said that the United
States is concerned about the possibility of a terrorist attack
against Americans or U.S. facilities in Europe this weekend.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher had no specific
information about the alleged threat and said the U.S. government
was not urging Americans to cancel travel plans to Europe. Instead,
travelers are encouraged to be alert to any danger, he said.
   Other officials said threat advisory messages have been sent in
recent days to U.S. diplomatic posts in Europe and the Middle East.
   Boucher said the U.S. concern is linked to the 11th anniversary
of the Islamic revolution in Iran this Sunday.
   Officials said that Iran has established a far-flung terrorist
network targeted at American and West European interests,
especially civil aviation. But officials said Thursday that they
had no details on what type of U.S. facility might be a terrorist
target this weekend.
   In December, an advisory was issued warning of the possibility
of an attack against an American or Western European target but
Thursday's announcement spoke only of ``U.S. interests'' as
possible targets.
   In London, a British Transport Department spokesman said: ``The
U.S. announcement does not advise of any threat against civil
aviation but we have taken the notice into account.''
   There were no reports of large-scale cancellation of tickets or
tourism packages in Britain following the American warning, which
was featured in British news reports.

   State Sen. Joseph Montoya resigned his
state Senate seat today in the wake of his conviction on political
corruption charges.
   Returning to his home town in southern California for the
announcement Thursday, Montoya met the deadline set by the Senate
Rules Committee for him to resign voluntarily or face expulsion
action on the Senate floor.
   The former chairman of the Senate Business and Professions
Committee was convicted last week in federal district court on
extortion, racketeering and money laundering charges. He plans to
appeal.
   Montoya is the first California legislator in 35 years to be
convicted of a felony while in office.
   Montoya, 50, cited the energies he expects to expend on his
appeal and his desire to spare his family the pain of the media
spotlight as reasons for his resignation.
   ``As you know, I have maintained my innocence throughout the
indictment and trial, and I believe in my heart that I will be
eventually vindicated on appeal,'' he said.

<HEAD>Peace Activist Released from Prison, Says He'd Meet PLO Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KFAR SAVA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli peace activist imprisoned
four months for meeting PLO leader Yasser Arafat said upon his
release today that he would gladly meet Arafat again.
   As Abie Nathan emerged from the prison near this town north of
Tel Aviv, teen-agers from a nearby collective farm gave him a white
dove, which he symbolically freed.
   He then shook hands with the director of the prison and said
``lehitraot,'' Hebrew for ``until we meet again.''
   Nathan, 63, was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading
guilty to meeting Arafat and other Palestine Liberation
Organization activists in Tunisia in 1988. He entered Eyal prison
Oct. 10, and the penalty was reduced by two months for good
behavior.
   Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist organization, and an
amendment to Israel's anti-terror law passed in 1986 makes meeting
with PLO leaders punishable with jail terms of up to three years.
   Only a handful of supporters were on hand in pouring rain to
greet Nathan, who operates a pirate radio station called ``voice of
peace'' off Israel's coast.
   ``I will meet with Palestinians and with any Arab leader who
stretches his hand to talk of peace,'' Nathan said outside the
prison. ``I will meet Arafat another dozen times. I have met him
already seven times.''
   Nathan first met Arafat in 1982 when he went to Lebanon during
the Israeli siege of Beirut in a unsuccessful attempt to gain
freedom for a captured Israeli soldier.
   He said he was willing to risk another prison sentence because
``this is my way of fighting.''
   Nathan also pledged to fight to change the law under which he
was jailed.
   ``I was put in a prison because of a law which is an
undemocratic law which would not be accepted anywhere in the
world,'' Nathan said. ``I will do everything in my power in order
to continue my struggle to change that law.''
   Among those greeting Nathan was peace activist Latif Dori, who
also has met with PLO officials. Dori carried a placard with a
picture of Nathan holding an olive branch and the words, ``They
can't arrest peace.''
   Nathan is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private
plane to Cairo in 1964 to try to convince Egypt to make peace with
Israel. In 1978, he went on a 45-day hunger strike to protest the
building of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   His radio station broadcasts his peace message and music from a
ship in the Mediterranean sea.

<HEAD>CBS Suspends Andy Rooney For Remarks Attributed To Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS News humorist Andy Rooney, his future
uncertain after a three-month suspension without pay, denies he
made racial comments attributed to him in a gay magazine and said
he wants to return to ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS News President David Burke told Rooney in a meeting that CBS
would not tolerate racist remarks, according to a statement from
Burke, who did not return phone calls for further comment on the
suspension.
   Rooney deined making the comments, but ``I guess Burke believes
the person who said I said it,'' Rooney said.
   Rooney was interviewed by Chris Bull, a reporter with The
Advocate, a biweekly magazine based in Los Angeles. The article was
to be published today.
   Rooney has worked in news and entertainment at CBS for 40 years
and has been the resident humorist at ``60 Minutes'' since 1978.
   In a brief phone interview, he declined to say whether he
thought Burke's action was fair, but he later said in a statement
the controversy put Burke ``in a difficult position, and I accepted
his offer of suspension rather than to permanently end my career at
CBS.''
   Rooney's suspension is immediate. He won't be seen this Sunday
in his usual ``60 Minutes'' slot, a spokesman for the program said.
   Also Thursday, network officials were quoted as saying
anchorwoman Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This Morning'' was being
taken off the program, which has been rated consistently below
morning ABC and NBC shows. Sullivan could not be reached for
comment.
   Rooney was quoted as saying that ``most people are born with
equal intelligence, but blacks have watered down their genes
because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most
children. They drop out of school early, do drugs and get
pregnant.''
   Rooney denied making the slur. ``It is a know-nothing statement
which I abhor,'' he said.
   Rooney won his first Emmy award in 1968 for his script for a
special program about blacks, ``Black History: Lost, Stolen, or
Strayed,'' which was narrated by Bill Cosby.
   Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite said Rooney, a friend since
the two were correspondents in World War II, was not a racist.
   Cronkite said his ``more outrageous comments'' may offend some
people from time to time, ``but any suggestions that such a rare
journalistic voice should be silenced indicates a dangerous
weakness in our pluralistic society.''
   The article, in which Rooney also discussed homosexuals, was
entitled, ``Andy, We Hardly Knew Ye,'' and had a subtitle, ``And
Now, a Few Homophobic Minutes with Andy Rooney.''
   Rooney's suspension came two years after CBS fired Jimmy ``The
Greek'' Snyder as an ``NFL Today'' commentator after he said blacks
were better athletes than whites because they were ``bred that
way'' during slavery.
   In his statement, Burke said that Rooney's future with CBS will
be discussed at the end of the suspension.
   ``I have made it clear that CBS News cannot tolerate such
remarks or anything that approximates such comments,'' Burke said.
``Mr. Rooney has expressed his dismay that the values of CBS News
have been called into question, and offers his deepest apologies to
any in our society who are given offense.''
   Rooney said he would continue writing his twice-weekly
syndicated humor column, which he said is distributed to about 260
newspapers.
   Bull, the reporter, said his quotations of Rooney, taken down
during a phone interview three weeks ago, were accurate. He did not
tape the interview.
   On Wednesday, Benjamin Hooks, director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called the
purported remarks ``ill-informed and racist.''
   Hooks praised CBS for moving so quickly, but said the NAACP did
not ``wish to rush in judgment and we will insist that there be a
further and thorough investigation.''
   New York Mayor David Dinkins called CBS to ``register shock,''
according to a spokesman. Later, Dinkins said: ``Gay men and
lesbians, as well as African-Americans, are justified in their
outrage about both Mr. Rooney's comments and his subsequent
attempts to explain them away.''
   Rooney previously has gotten into hot water with homosexual
groups because of a remark he made in a Dec. 28 CBS special, ``A
Year With Andy Rooney: 1989.''
   In that show, he said that, ``many of the ills which kill us are
self-induced,'' and then cited ``too much alcohol, too much food,
homosexual unions, cigarettes.''

<HEAD>Israeli Officials Applaud East Germany for Stand on Holocaust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli officials today praised East Germany's
decision to acknowledge a share of responsibility for the Holocaust
but said they want practical steps before forging ties with that
country.
   In a letter released Thursday, Prime Minister Hans Modrow of
East Germany recognized that his people bore some of the
responsibility for the deaths during the Holocaust. He also pledged
``material support'' for the victims of Nazi persecution but did
not elaborate.
   Michael Shilo, an Israeli Foreign Ministry adviser on diaspora
affairs, said today, ``We have to ... chew a little bit on the
wording of Modrow's declaration. But obviously it is a beginning. I
don't think we have ever heard before this kind of a declaration
from East Germany.''
   Israel and East Germany never had formal ties because of East
Germany's denial of responsibility for the Holocaust, in which an
estimated 6 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.
   East Germany has maintained it was a new state created in 1949
by Communists and could not accept blame for crimes committed by
the Third Reich in World War II. Communists also suffered
persecution under the Nazis.
   However, in his letter addressed to Edgar Bronfman, president of
the World Jewish Congress, Modrow said East Germany ``recognizes
the responsibility of the entire German people for the past.''
   ``This is a consequence of the deep guilt of Hitler fascism,
which committed terrible crimes against the Jewish people in the
name of the German people,'' Modrow said.
   The daily Jerusalem Post today reported a similar letter was
sent to the Israeli government and that its text was approved in
last week's talks between the two countries in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Those discussions were described as a preparatory meeting to
discuss establishment of ties.
   Israel followed the talks with a statement saying establishing
relations would be linked ``to the question of the acceptance by
(East Germany) of its share in the moral and historical
responsibility'' for Nazi crimes against the Jews.
   Shilo, who attended the talks in Copenhagen, welcomed Modrow's
statement in an Israel radio interview today.
   Asked whether Israel could now establish diplomatic relations
with East Germany, Shilo said: ``A verbal declaration is just a
beginning. A verbal declaration should be backed up by some
tangible deeds in terms of education in school curriculum, and
maybe in legislation and some other things.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted East Germany's
shift in position came as speculation increased about uniting
Germany, which was split in the aftermath of World War II. Israeli
leaders have expressed fears of unification.
   West Germany has accepted blame for the crimes of Nazi Germany
and paid $43 billion in reparations to Holocaust survivors and
their families over the years.
   Israel Singer, secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress,
said his group is now likely to handle the issue of reparations
from East Germany.

   The Walt Disney theme parks will
no longer send passes to elected officials that entitled them to a
year of free admissions.
   From now on, legislators, congressmen, city and county
commissioners and other politicians will have to call and ask for
tickets if they want to visit the Florida and California parks
without charge.
   The Walt Disney Co. said the practice was stopped because some
of the elected officials found it difficult to place a value on the
Silver Passes for gift-disclosure purposes.
   Bill Jones, executive director of Common Cause in Florida, said
Disney's new policy will direct attention to elected officials who
ask for free tickets.
   ``Now it is incumbent on the elected officials to out-and-out
ask for these favors instead of having them offered to them,''
Jones said.
   The pass allowed officials to bring up to four guests each time
they visited. In Florida, one adult admission to a Disney park
costs $30.65.

   A cold front with a 400-mile wide band of clouds stretched from
the Ohio Valley to the lower Great Lakes today, ending a warm
spell, while storms continued to dump rain and snow on Washington
and Oregon.
   Northwesterly winds today cooled temperatures in the heartland
far below Thursday's numerous record highs. Even with the chill,
however, readings were expected to be seasonably warm.
   In Washington state, Snoqualmie Pass remained closed early today
as heavy snow clogged roadways in the Cascade Mountains. Stevens
Pass and White Pass reopened Thursday while the Northern Cascades
Highway was closed for the season.
   Snow advisories continued in the Cascades and Olympic Mountains.
Rain mixed with snow was forecast for western Washington tonight.
   Scattered showers were expected today from eastern Texas to
northern Maine. Showers and thunderstorms developed north of a warm
front over the central Gulf Coast on Thursday, dumping 2 inches of
rain on New Orleans.
   Strong winds and bitter cold spawned dangerous wind chill
readings over parts of Alaska. Bethel expected wind chills nearing
80 below zero. Thursday's low temperature in Alaska was 58 below in
Circle City.
   Ely, Nev., claimed the coldest reading in the lower 48 states at
minus 20.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed Thursday in the
south-central and eastern U.S. Five cities in Michigan alone
reported record high readings, including Flint, which eclipsed the
old mark of 43 set 25 years ago by 10 degrees.
   Record high temperatures for Feb. 8 set on Thursday included 42
in International Falls, Minn., and Negaunee, Mich.; 45 in Alpena,
Mich., and Binghamton, N.Y.; 47 in Mansfield, Ohio; 56 in
Youngstown, Ohio; 57 in Muskegon, Mich.; 58 in Rockford, Ill.; 59

<HEAD>Legislators Urge Probe of Media, Police Tactics in Stuart Shooting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill creating a special commission with subpoena
powers to investigate the way the media and police handled events
unfolding from the shooting of Carol Stuart won support from
several lawmakers and the governor.
   ``If this thing continues and if there is no cleansing of the
wound ... a lot of people are going to be hurt,'' state Sen. Bill
Owens of Boston said at a hearing Thursday before a joint Judiciary
Committee.
   Backers of the bill said that a study is needed to determine why
police focused on a black suspect in the initial investigation, and
why reports about the investigation were leaked to the media.
   The bill would establish an 11-member commission that could meet
in secrecy much like a grand jury.
   Charles Stuart originally told investigators that he and his
pregnant wife were shot by a black mugger while leaving a
childbirth class. Mrs. Stuart died of her wounds and the couple's
son, born prematurely after the shooting, died later.
   Stuart apparently committed suicide last month, after
investigators learned his story was a hoax and that he had plotted
to kill his wife.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he supports the bill. ``The
creation of a commission would allow us to step back and look at
the larger picture,'' he said in a letter to the committee.
   Members of Boston's black community criticized the way police
handled the investigation, saying young black men were targeted
unfairly during police searches.
   Many of those who spoke in favor of creating the commission said
the media must take much of the blame for the way the Stuart case
was presented to the public.
   ``The media today is a business. The media is a big business.
The media is a profitable business,'' said House Ways and Means
Chairman Richard Voke, whose law partner is representing members of
the Stuart family. ``If people get riled up, it's good for
business.''
   One member of the committee, Rep. Michael Flaherty of Boston,
spoke against the proposal, saying it could hurt the criminal
investigation. ``The creation of such a commission would be
improper, imprudent and unprecedented,'' he said.
   Frank McGee, attorney for the Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association, said there was no need for a special commission to do
what 15 agencies already have the authority to do. He said the
police's actions in the case were appropriate.
   ``The police response was excellent,'' he said. ``If anything,
they should have been even more aggressive.''
   But several groups, including the National Organization for
Women and the Anti-Defamation League, said a commission was needed.
   ``The interest in this case _ on the part of city officials,
state leaders and the media _ reflects nothing short of insidious
institutional racism,'' Ellen Convisser, president of Boston NOW,
said in prepared remarks.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts To Admit Girls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breaking with an 80-year tradition and a warning
in the first Boy Scout manual that girls can ``lower a man's innate
character,'' the British boys' group has opened its doors to the
other sex.
   The decision, announced Thursday by Chief Scout Garth Morrison,
prompted criticism from the Girl Guides, the Boy Scouts' sister
movement.
   A Scout spokesman said Thursday there were 680,000 British
Scouts, and there had been a lot of pressure from girls eager to
join, attracted by the more adventurous activities.
   Morrison announced local Scout groups would be able to choose
whether to admit girls, noting that some ``want nothing to do with
girls.'' No group would be forced to have them, he said.
   ``We are aware that in some places there is a pressing need for
it, and we are anxious to meet that need. It is an important move
and a move in the right direction,'' Morrison said.
   Morrison, an ex-Royal Navy lieutenant, said the Scout movement
would be opened to girls ages 6 to 15, with the first girl scouts
probably enrolled in 1991.
   The Boy Scouts of America movement has allowed girls ages 6 to
15 in its explorer division for about 19 years, according to
national spokesman Lee Sneath.
   Dr. June Paterson-Brown, chief commissioner of the British Girl
Guides Association, said she was ``very angry'' when she learned of
the decision.
   ``I hope we are big enough to say that if the Scouts want this,
it's their decision. If they try to poach our girls, then it will
make things very difficult,'' she said.
   The two groups had just finished a two-year joint study on
greater cooperation.
   The head of the Guides, who count Queen Elizabeth II as their
most famous ex-member, added: ``They are out of step. Youth
services in general have gone full circle and now generally tend to
favor single-sex activity again.''
   Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, developed many
of his ideas about scouting from his experiences in the Boer War
and originally envisaged the group as a surveillance force to keep
watch on enemy movements.
   When Baden-Powell founded the Scouts, he allowed girls to join.
   ``Although he had difficulty communicating with women and
preferred the company of boys and men, it had always been his
intention that the scouts would be for boys and girls,'' biographer
Timothy Jeal told The Times of London. ``It was only an Edwardian
outcry against the coarsening effect that such a thing would have
on genteel young ladies that forced him to abandon the idea.''
   The Times said eight girls had come in uniform to the first
national scout rally in 1910. Baden-Powell reportedly turned to his
sister, Agnes, and said, ``Do something about them, will you?'' The
Girl Guides were founded two months later.
   Baden-Powell himself always had doubts about the effect of the
female of the species on the psyche of the developing male. In his
1908 founding manual, ``Scouting for Boys,'' he wrote: ``A loud,
vulgar girl could lower a man's innate character.''
   Nicola Lowes, 14, who was turned down in October when she and
two friends applied to join the Scout group in Wark, northern
England, said she would reapply Monday.
   ``I was in the Guides for a little while, but I thought it was
really boring,'' she said. ``Scouts seem more active, and you get
outdoors more. I was really upset when I was turned down .... It
just wasn't fair.''

   The sweeping changes in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe could lead to persecution of Jews, so they
should emigrate while the can to Israel, said former New York Mayor
Ed Koch.
   Slavic anti-Semitism, held in check by Communist governments,
could explode in new pogroms if nationalist parties take over in
the Soviet bloc, Koch said in a speech Thursday to the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``They ought to leave and board those El Al planes as soon as
they can and fly on wings of eagles to the state of Israel,'' Koch
told about 640 people attending a meeting of the group's executive
committee, which bestowed him with the league's Distinguished
Public Service Award.
   Koch, defeated last year by David Dinkins in his try for a
fourth term as mayor, said he now has a radio show, a television
show, a newspaper column and is out of politics for good.

<HEAD>Equipment Seized From NY Port Authority to Pay $910 Debt.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington consultant who has been fighting
the bureaucracy of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
for months has walked into its offices here and seized repayment in
office equipment, according to a published report.
   U.S. Marshals accompanied Frank M. Graves as he carried a fax
machine, a computer and other equipment from the office of the $1.4
billion agency Thursday morning to repay the $909.80 debt,
according to a story in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Graves had been fighting the Port Authority for months in small
claims court, saying the agency owed him the money for filling in
as a speaker at a $2,500-a-head seminar run by the authority. The
agency said it had made no such agreement with Graves.
   Graves won judgment when the agency failed to turn up for a
hearing. He was therefore allowed to collect $1,524.15, adding
court costs to the original amount under dispute, according to The
Post. When the money wasn't paid him, Graves obtained a writ of
seizure and took the two U.S. Marshals to the office to collect the
full amount in cash and assets, The Post said.
   ``The whole case is based upon a giant mistake made by the
court,'' Hugh Welsh, an assistant general counsel in New York, told
The Post. As a public agency, the Port Authority has ``sovereign
immunity'' from lawsuits, he said.
   ``I guess the answer is, you've got to come to court to say
that,'' responded Superior Court Commissioner Thomas J. Gaye, who
issued the ruling for Graves in November.
   D.C. law allows the authority to reopen the case, which it began
efforts to do Thursday afternoon by hiring a local law firm to seek
the return of its equipment and dismissal of the case.

   Hungary and the Vatican today formally
re-established diplomatic ties that were severed in 1945, the state
news agency MTI reported.
   The action as the latest sign of improvement in relations
between the Roman Catholic church and Eastern European countries
that toppled hard-line Communist leaders in popular revolutions
last year.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth and Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the
Vatican secretary of state, signed the document restoring ties in
Parliament.
   Casaroli arrived Wednesday on a five-day visit.
   In restoring relations with the Vatican, Hungary became the
second East bloc country to do so in less than a year. Poland
re-established ties in July.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist government has also said it
wants to restore ties with the Holy See.
   Negotiations between Hungary and the Vatican had been going on
for months, and both sides had earlier agreed Pope John Paul II
would visit Hungary next year.
   Parliament passed a law Jan. 24 that separates church and state,
ending state interference in church affairs, and grants all
denominations full autonomy. Separate legislation legislation is
planned on the return of confiscated church assets.
   Under pressure from the Stalinist leadership, Hungary's Catholic
church surrendered its autonomy on Aug. 30, 1950. That law was
formally annulled Tuesday.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Constituent Assembly today
unanimously adopted a democratic, Western-style constitution in
preparation for Namibia's independence from South Africa on March
21.
   The constitution guarantees fundamental individual rights and
limits a president to two five-year terms, a rarity in a continent
where leaders often serve for life.
   Its unanimous adoption represents a spirit of reconciliation
among assembly members who were on opposite sides during a 23-year
guerrilla war for independence.
   The 72-member assembly approved the constitution in a session
held on the front steps of the Tintenpalast, the legislative
building on a hilltop in Windhoek.
   ``Today the masses of our people have a constitution which
embodies their aspirations to be masters of their own destiny,''
said Sam Nujoma, who is expected to be the first president and is
leader of the dominant South-West Africa People's Organization.
   The session also was attended by Louis Pienaar, the South
African administrator of the territory, and Martti Ahtisaari, head
of the U.N. contingent monitoring the independence process.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since 1915, but agreed to grant
independence under a regional peace treaty also signed by Angola
and Cuba. More than 6,000 U.N. civilian and military personnel have
been monitoring the process since last April.
   Nujoma's group, which began a bush war against South African
rule in 1966, won 41 assembly seats in November's election and will
form the first government.
   Despite a hard-fought campaign and sharp ideological
differences, the seven parties represented in the assembly quickly
reached agreement on the constitution.
   It has a declaration of fundamental rights, including freedom of
movement, speech and the press. It also envisions a multiparty
democracy, regular elections, an independent judiciary and a
president.
   Most of the Cabinet posts already have been appointed by Nujoma.
Today, he named a white businessman, Gert Hanekom, to serve as
minister of agriculture.
   Nujoma has named whites, businessmen, and opposition party
members to his Cabinet in a bid reconcile Namibia after the lengthy
war and to ease fears of the 75,000 whites, who control most of the
economy.
   The independence celebrations next month are expected to attract
more than 20 heads of state and thousands of foreign guests to
Windhoek, a town which has only a few hotels.
   The city has a population of about 120,000 and is by far the
largest city in the semi-arid territory of 1.3 million people.

<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament has declared its 1940
annexation by the Soviet Union was ``unlawful and invalid,'' and
Tass today acknowledged the move as a step toward secession.
   The Lithuanians, whose Communist Party broke with the Kremlin in
December, took the new action Wednesday. They said they want to
start talks with Moscow on Lithuanian independence.
   Estonia took a similar action in November, declaring the
annexation of the Baltic republics invalid.
   The legislatures of all three Baltic republics, including
Latvia, already had condemned the Soviet-German agreement of 1939
that gave free rein to Hitler in Poland and to Stalin in the
Baltics.
   Lithuanian's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Wednesday passed
a resolution declaring that legislation passed on July 21, 1940,
making Lithuania a Soviet republic did not express the will of the
people and was ``unlawful and invalid.''
   The Lithuanian action coincided with the final day of a meeting
of the national Communist Party Central Committee, where party
leaders denounced the Lithuanian party for breaking ties with
Moscow. They said the split undermines the unity of the party and
damages President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   However, the Central Committee also said it was ready to drop
its own constitutional guarantee of power and accept a multiparty
system.
   In its report, Tass, the official news agency, said Wednesday's
resolution in Lithuania ``cannot be regarded otherwise than a step
toward this Baltic republic's secession from the Soviet Union.''
   ``Will Lithuania and the Soviet Union proceed along the road
together or take separate paths?'' the news agency asked. ``Time
will judge who is right in this contention.''
   The Lithuanian resolution also called for abolishing all
constitutional ties of Lithuanians to the Soviet Union and
returning some nationalized industries to private ownership.

<HEAD>Navy Wants to Keep Public Away from Errant Bombs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cows can graze on land littered with errant
ordnance from neighboring naval bombing ranges, but people are too
curious to be allowed to hike or drive off-road vehicles there, a
Navy commander said.
   ``We don't feel cattle are inquisitive enough to go over and
start banging on a bomb with a hammer,'' Capt. Rex Rackowitz,
commander of Fallon Naval Air Station, said Thursday.
   ``We should not ever allow the public to go on there for any
recreational purposes,'' Rackowitz told the state Multiple Use
Advisory Committee on Federal Lands.
   Rackowitz appeared to explain the Navy's ``Operation Ugly Baby''
last year to clear out or blow up bombs and other ordnance dropped
outside his base's ranges for 30 years because of pilot or
equipment error.
   About 110,000 acres of federal Bureau of Land Management
property, adjacent to three Fallon base ranges starting about 60
miles east of Reno, have been closed temporarily for winter while
the cleanup progresses.
   The bureau opposes letting the Navy acquire the land, however.
Bureau spokesman Bob Stewart said any permanent closure of the land
around the naval base's ranges would require congressional action.
   ``It's either totally open or totally closed,'' Stewart told the
state panel.
   Environmentalists and state officials also oppose the Navy's
request.
   During the cleanup efforts that were initially secret but made
public in news reports, the Navy said it recovered 1,270 live
pieces of ordnance on the three ranges, including 80 bombs, and
1,996 inert pieces of ordnance, including 52 bombs, one rocket and
88 small training bombs.
   The Navy believes it retrieved about 92 percent of the surface
bombs dropped on the public lands where cattle have grazed and
people have hiked and ridden off-road vehicles since the base
opened in 1942.
   But the military can't get at below-surface explosives and duds
that landed outside its bombing areas because of pilot or equipment
error or which bounced on the desert surface and over fences
surrounding the ranges, Rackowitz said.
   ``We have to assume there's a significant quantity of ordnance
lying below the surface, which we have no capability of finding,''
he said.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Gorbachev saying more reforms
coming, adviser warns party must reform or lose power. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pledged
to press on with yet more reforms once he has implemented the
sweeping limits on Communist Party power he pushed through the
leadership just days ago.
   An economic adviser warned the party faces the stark choice of
reforming itself or losing power to the opponents it has agreed to
legalize, and leading populist Boris N. Yeltsin said progressive
Communists may break away to form their own party.
   The comments by economist Nikolai Petrakov were the first since
the party's Central Committee agreed to end Communists' monopoly on
power in which a top official raised the possibility that it
actually could lose its ruling position.
   Gorbachev, meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, said he had achieved everything he had set out to do at a
three-day meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee that
ended Wednesday.
   ``Once we have solidified this phase, we will move on,'' he said.
   Gorbachev gave a guarded answer when asked if he would run for
president if the country implements a new, stronger office chosen
by a contested election.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he told reporters at the start of his
meeting with Baker.
   Looking relaxed as he spoke with a half-dozen reporters, he
added that the changes pushed through the Central Committee this
week had been in the works ever since he took power in 1985.
   ``It certainly would be wrong for the West and everyone to
believe we began these changes only in the last few days,'' he
said. ``They have been under way since 1985.''
   On Wednesday, the Central Committee gave Gorbachev nearly
unanimous approval of his proposal to strike an article of the
Soviet Constitution that guarantees the party the role of the
country's leading and guiding'' force. Gorbachev said that now on
the party will have to prove its right to rule.
   The Central Committee also gave Gorbachev approval to move up
the next party Congress, which has the power to choose a new party
leadership.
   Petrakov told Tass that after the party gives up its guarantee
of power the party may face the possibility of losing power or
perhaps even disappearing altogether.
   ``A choice stands before the party in the conditions of
political pluralism: restructure itself and struggle to show in
competition its right to be the ruling party, or slide into
opposition, maybe even to leave the political arena,'' Petrakov
said.
   Reformers contend that the party's decision to release its legal
grip on power doesn't address the country's main problems, economic
chaos and continued pervasive party control of society.
   Yeltsin, an unorthodox Communist who has emerged as the leading
advocate of far-reaching change, on Thursday called the party's new
program only a ``half-step forward.''
   ``You talk about approving this program, how can I do it?'' he
asked.
   A second party should be formed unless the congress removes
conservatives from the party hierarchy, said Yeltsin, who cast the
only vote against the changes Wednesday in the policy-marking
Central Committee.
   Reformers said the party must end its seven-decade strangehold
on the nation's institutions to fulfill its promise for a
multiparty political system.
   ``It is necessary to eliminate party organizations in the army,
the police, the KGB, the courts, in all the state institutions,''
saidYuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the independent Democratic Union.
   The movement for reform is building popular strength, with a
growing number of angry crowds across the Soviet Union demanding
the ouster of hard-line Communist leaders, Mityunov said.
   Party secretaries in Volgograd, Tyumen, Chernigov and Sverdlovsk
were removed in recent weeks. The TV program ``Vremya'' showed a
rally in Donetsk on Thursday where people demanded the resignation
of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a leading conservative.
   In London, party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev said the
country had avoided a ``cataclysmic explosion'' in putting into
effect Gorbachev's program of reforms, known as perestroika. ``We
have channeled this process into an area of controlled reaction,''
he told a news conference.
   Yeltsin, who also belongs to the Soviet Parliament, called the
platform ``a half-step forward ... that lessens the tension before
the (party) congress'' late in June.
   The party Congress will vote on the party platform and has the
power to change the Central Committee.
   Yeltsin said the party platform, which has yet to be made
available in its details to the public, contained outdated language
and failed to endorse radical measures needed to undo the economic
chaos created by central planning.
   He said the draft still endorses ``democratic centralism,'' the
principle used to justify central planning.

   Increased violence by drug dealers
trying to establish turf in western New York has prompted some
dealers to enlist members of a notorious California gang to fight
their battles, police said.
   Police, who have suspected that members of the Los Angeles-based
Crips were in Buffalo for the past 18 months, on Wednesday arrested
six people believed to be Crips.
   ``Our investigation indicates they were being brought in to
assist in retaliations of narcotics shootings in Buffalo,'' said
Lt. M. James Starr, in charge of the Cheektowaga police narcotics
division.
   Buffalo police estimate about 20 Crips now live in Buffalo.
   The Crips are major traffickers of crack cocaine, according to a
study by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1989. Along with
the ``Bloods'' and Jamaican posses, they are described as
``extremely violent'' and ``operate on a `no innocent bystander'
theory.''

<HEAD>Burmese Troops Said to Capture Rebel Stronghold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops have overrun a
stronghold of ethnic minority rebels along the Thai border after 10
days of fighting that killed at least 36 people, a military
spokesman said today.
   The seizure of the town represented another in a string of
victories in recent months that has crippled Burma's ethnic Karen
insurgents.
   Thai authorities, confirming the capture of Three Pagoda Pass,
said 3,000 to 5,000 civilians had fled into Thailand to escape the
fighting.
   The capture came as rebels of the New Mon State Party and the
Karen National Union were preparing to celebrate their national
days. Foreign correspondents in Bangkok, Thailand, had been invited
to the festivities and a news conference at Three Pagoda Pass this
weekend.
   Col. Than Tun, a military spokesman, told reporters that 16
government soldiers were killed and 42 wounded in five major
clashes leading to the capture of the frontier town Thursday. He
said 20 rebel bodies were counted.
   Than Tun said mopping up operations were continuing in the area,
located 170 miles southeast of Rangoon and 175 miles northwest of
Bangkok.
   The Mon and Karen rebels are among several ethnic groups
fighting for greater autonomy from the government dominated by the
Burman majority.
   Col. Lertchai Pinthong of Thailand's border police said fighting
was continuing today at a Mon military camp two miles from Three
Pagoda Pass. He said Thais living in a village opposite the town
had fled their homes and some wounded were being treated at
hospitals inside Thailand.
   The border police also reported escalated fighting at Kaw Moo
Ra, further north along the Thai-Burmese frontier.
   Burmese troops have been trying to seize that Karen base and had
stepped up artillery and mortar barrages in recent days, the police
said.
   Government forces have overrun a string of Karen military bases
along the border, although the Karen National Union's headquarters
at Manerplaw has not been attacked.
   The ramshackle town of Three Pagodas Pass includes a thriving
marketplace, warehouses brimming with smuggled goods and the Mon
headquarters. Some Karen also have been living there.
   The ethnic insurgents have come to rely on smuggling between
Thailand and Burma to fuel their rebellions, while the Burmese
government has stepped up efforts to control the jungle frontier.
   The Mon claim to field more than 3,000 fighters, while the Karen
have a considerably larger force.
   The two have joined 20 other insurgent groups in the Democratic
Alliance of Burma, which has vowed to topple the martial law
government of Gen. Saw Maung.
   Saw Maung and a group of military officers put down a
nationwide, pro-democracy uprising nearly two years ago, killing
hundreds of people. The resistance forces now include students who
fled the interior in wake of the crackdown and sought refuge with
the rebel groups.

   High school wrestlers focusing on pins, reversals
and takedowns had better worry about ``herpes gladiatorum'' too,
federal health researchers say.
   An outbreak of the viral skin disease swept through a high
school wrestling camp in Minnesota last summer, leaving 60 out of
175 young men battling symptoms including blistery skin rash,
fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes, the national Centers
for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   The disease is spread, the CDC said, through skin-to-skin
contact _ obviously a problem for wrestlers.
   The Atlanta-based CDC said wrestlers should have skin
examinations before practice or matches and wrestlers with
suspicious skin lesions should sit out.
   The virus is herpes simplex type 1, the same one that causes
cold sores; a different virus, herpes simplex type 2, causes
genital herpes.
   And although the skin rash and other symptoms go away, the
infection, like all herpes infections, can reappear months or years
later.
   In 1985, a survey of athletic trainers found that about 3
percent of the nation's high school wrestlers had herpes skin
infections during the previous wrestling season.
   Herpes gladiatorum was reported in 1964 in a study in the New
England Journal of Medicine. It also is know to afflict players of
rugby, another contact sport.
   ``We really don't know to what extent it is a problem, but it
seems to be recognized by the wrestling community as something to
watch out for,'' said Dr. Edward Belongia, a CDC medical
epidemiologist at the Minnesota Department of Health.
   Some of the 60 young wrestlers who became ill at the Robinson
Wrestling Camp at the University of Minnesota last summer already
have had a recurrence, Belongia said. It's not known if they have
spread the ailment to any other wrestlers in this year's
competition.
   The outbreak was discovered during the final week of the 26-day
Minnesota camp, and contact was discontinued for the final two
days. Herpes conjunctivitis _ inflammation of the eye covering _
occurred in five patients, although none developed keratitis, a
more serious inflammation of the cornea.

   The governing party and two opposition
groups formally merged today into a powerful new conservative
coalition, and hundreds of radical students battled police in two
cities to protest the alliance.
   The leader of the only remaining opposition party denounced the
merger as ``a kind of coup d'etat'' that betrayed the people. No
injuries or arrests were reported in the student protests in Seoul
and the southern city of Kwangju.
   In a joint rally, 105 delegates from the governing party and two
opposition groups unanimously voted to join forces as the
Democratic Liberal Party and ratified its platform, constitution
and basic policies.
   President Roh Tae-woo, along with Kim Young-sam and Kim
Jong-pil, leaders of the country's second and third largest
opposition parties, were named as the new coalition's ``supreme
leaders'' for two-year terms.
   In an address read by a deputy, Roh praised the merger as a
historic step that will bring stability and peace to Korea's
faction-ridden politics and promised that the new party would
accelerate democratic reforms.
   In Kwangju, about 1,000 students clashed with police after an
anti-government, anti-U.S. rally at Chonam University, said the
national news agency, Yonhap.
   It said about 1,000 riot police, backed by armored vans with
tear-gas launchers, stormed into the school to break up the rally,
Yonhap said.
   The students countered with rocks and firebombs, touching off
running battles that lasted nearly an hour, Yonhap said.
   Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, is the seat of opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung, whose party was isolated by the merger. The
city was also the scene of a 1980 civil uprising that left about
200 people killed.
   Students demanded the expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg,
claiming that Washington was behind the three-party merger.
   In Seoul, about 300 students at Yonsei and Seoul National
Universities threw rocks in clashes with police after separate
rallies at their schools.
   No injuries or arrests were reported in either protest.
   Dissidents and radical students have vowed to lead a nationwide
movement against the new party.
   But Kim Dae-jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, denounced the merger as ``a kind of coup d'etat that
reversed people's will.''
   ``The merger was a step backward in democracy. It was a
miscalculation and disregarded the people's power,'' he said.
   Kim, labeled by some government officials as a leftist, claimed
many voters ``feel betrayed'' after finding that opposition
legislators they elected are now members of the governing party.
   The new party will be registered with election authorities by
Feb. 15, a procedure required by law, and begin to act as a single
negotiating body on Feb. 19, when the National Assembly opens a
special 20-day session.
   The new party will hold at least 210 of the 299 seats in the
one-house legislature, a majority that enables it to revise the
Constitution whenever it chooses.
   The legislature was previously controlled by three opposition
parties, headed by Kim Dae-jung's party.
   One senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Roh now will concentrate more on state affairs than party
issues.
   Under new leadership to be installed at a party convention in
April, Kim Young-sam would be made the chief executive of the new
party, he said. Kim, 62, is regarded as a likely successor to Roh,
whose term expires in 1993.
   Observers believe that the new party would push a constitutional
change next year to replace the nation's current presidential
system of government with a parliamentary system, headed by a
premier.
   Kim Dae-jung said his party's champions several issues spurned
by the new coalition _ the right to form independent labor unions,
a more equitable distribution of wealth, abolishment of the
national security law and further limitations on the country's
intelligence agency.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces ignored a truce
and traded heavy sniper fire in east Beirut today as hundreds of
civilians scrambled to safety outside the Christian sector.
   Snipers killed three people as they tried to escape the
low-income residential district of Ein Rummaneh, police said.
   Rescuers evacuated the bullet-riddled corpses of 42 victims from
east Beirut districts, where most of the savage fighting took place
between soldiers of Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea's Lebanese
Forces militiamen.
   Those victims raised the toll, by police count, to 418 killed
and 1,680 wounded in the worst intra-Christian conflict of the
15-year-old civil war. The fighting began Jan. 30.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
regulations, said the exchange of sniper fire threatened the pact
announced late Thursday to end the showdown for control of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave encompassing east Beirut and
coastal communities to the north.
   Aoun's soldiers are besieging the residential district of
Ashrafiyeh, a stronghold for Geagea's militia, from the northeast
and southeast.
   The clashes have divided east Beirut and other Christian
districts into hostile territories, forcing hundreds of civilians
to flee into the city's Moslem sector and other areas outside the
enclave.
   Local radio stations have been broadcasting messages from people
asking about missing relatives.
   Mrs. Nadima Mazboudi, worried about her daughter, Therese, and
crippled granddaughter, Reine, said over the Voice of the People
radio: ``Where is Reine? What happened to her?''
   Snipers' bullets whizzed overhead today as civilians, carrying
bags of clothes and other belongings, rushed into Moslem west
Beirut.
   In one Lebanese Forces' stronghold in the city, Ein Rummaneh,
Geagea's militiamen took cover on street corners.
   ``Aoun will pay dearly if he tries to storm Ein Rummaneh,'' said
a bearded Lebanese Forces militiaman.
   ``Thousands of his soldiers would be killed,'' he said and then
shouted to civilians to avoid mines planted in a nearby street.
   Snipers from Aoun's army fired at targets in the Ein Rummaneh
district, and Geagea's militias responded with salvoes from their
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles.
   ``Come and take our guns if you can!'' a militiaman shouted as
he fired a 30-bullet clip from his automatic rifle in the direction
of Aoun's lines.
   Geagea held a news conference and called Aoun, ``Mad, a liar, an
utter fool in politics.''
   ``You shouldn't think you can finish us off. We shall fight you
100 years,'' he said.
   The peace pact included a cease-fire agreement and ``affirmation
that there is no intention or decision to liquidate the Lebanese
Forces.''
   However, it said a ``national authority'' under Aoun should be
formed to tackle essential issues.
   Aoun has accused Geagea of trying to enforce an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end the nation's civil war. The
October accord, worked out by Lebanese legislators in Saudi Arabia,
led to the formation of a government under President Elias Hrawi,
also a Christian.
   However, Aoun attacked that pact because it set no date for
withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, who control most
of the country. Aoun, who was appointed last year to head an
interim cabinet, refused to acknowledge Hrawi's government.
   The Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under an
Arab League mandate to quell the civil war fighting.
   However, Aoun says they violated their peacekeeping mandate by
siding with the Moslems.

   ``CBS This Morning'' anchorwoman Kathleen
Sullivan, who said last year that she expected to be replaced if
her show's third-place ratings didn't improve, is being taken off
the program, her spokesman said today.
   ``She was notified by CBS brass Wednesday night,'' said the
spokesman, John Scanlon, who described Sullivan as ``disappointed,
but proud of her contributions to the show.''
   The program, co-anchored by Harry Smith, made no mention today
that she is leaving. Sullivan did not say anything about it on the
air. Terry Everett, a CBS News spokeswoman, said today that the
network ``can't confirm or deny'' reports that she is leaving.
   The anchorwoman, whose CBS contract expires in November, did her
part of today's show from Atlanta. Everett said the anchorwoman had
gone there on personal business.
   Scanlon said no decision has been made yet on when Sullivan will
leave ``CBS This Morning,'' but that she will help the transition
process and ``is looking forward to discussing other possibilities
at CBS.''
   There have been reports that her successor will be Paula Zahn,
anchorwoman of ABC's ``World News This Morning.'' Sullivan
co-anchored that program and news segments of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' before joining CBS News in 1987.
   ``We have no comment at this point,'' said ABC spokesman Scott
Richardson when asked if Zahn may be leaving ABC for CBS.
   ``CBS This Morning'' has consistently trailed ``Good Morning
America'' and NBC's ``Today'' in the ratings. The latter program
was in the headlines last fall when it became known that Jane
Pauley, the show's co-anchor for 13 years, would be succeeded by
Deborah Norvile.
   Norville began her new job in January.
   In October, during an appearance with Pauley on the ``Donahue''
syndicated talk show, Sullivan said she would be fired if her
show's ratings didn't improve.
   The month before, she riled CBS executives when, while speaking
into a microphone she didn't know was live, she joked that CBS
stood for ``Cheap Broadcasting Service.'' The comment was heard on
CBS' closed-circuit television system, but was not broadcast over
the air.

<TEXT>
   A man with at least seven
previous theft and fraud convictions was sentenced today to 12
years in prison for the shotgun murder of Frank Budd, father of
distance runner Zola Budd.
   Christiaan Barnard, 24, who could have been sentenced to hang,
was described by Supreme Court Justice A.P. von Coller as a
dishonest witness. But the judge said there was a reasonable
possibility that Barnard had been provoked into the killing because
Budd made sexual advances toward him.
   Barnard also was convicted of stealing a pick-up truck from
Budd's farm.
   Budd, 59 at the time of his death in September, was a
homosexual, according to associates and family members.
   Zola Budd said after his death that his homosexuality was a
factor in her parents' separation in 1984 and subsequent divorce.
She had very little contact with him after the divorce and did not
invite him to her wedding last year.
   Because of her father's British ancestry, Ms. Budd was able to
obtain a British passport and compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics
in Los Angeles. South Africans are barred from the Olympics and
most international competition because of the government's racial
segregation policies.
   In the 3,000-meter run in Los Angeles, Ms. Budd collided with
U.S. star Mary Decker, and the American was unable to finish. Budd
finished seventh to a chorus of boos.
   She later set several world distance records while living and
training in Britain but returned to South Africa in May 1988,
complaining of mental exhaustion because of harassment from
anti-apartheid activists.
   She has resumed competition in South Africa, although her times
are still far slower than her career bests.

   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
order calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie must be
carried out, Iran's spiritual leader said today.
   In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher condemned
today's sermon by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and said it was ``much to
be regretted.'' In a related development, nine Iranians deported
from Britain arrived in Tehran.
   Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, said Khomeini's fatwa, or
religious decree, ``about the writer of the blasphemous book, `The
Satanic Verses' is still valid and must be implemented,'' according
to a Tehran radio broadcast monitored in Nicosia.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born British author, has been in hiding in
Britain since Khomeini issued the decree Feb. 14, 1989. Moslem
fundamentalists consider his 1988 book blasphemous for its
irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder.
   Rushdie said this week he considered appearing in public to
deliver a lecture on censorship, but had been dissuaded by his
police guards. He also said he regretted the pain the book had
caused but said he stood by his work.
   He said he was pressing for a paperback edition. Viking Penguin,
Rushdie's publishers, has said no decision has been made about a
paperback edition.
   Blake Morrison, literary editor of The Independent on Sunday and
a friend of Rushdie, called Khamenei's statements ``disappointing
news in a week when he (Rushdie) has made a real effort to reopen
the debate in a more peaceful way.''
   ``Obviously it was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory
tone adopted here would filter through to Tehran,'' Morrison told
BBC radio.
   The international controversy over the book increased last year
when Khomeini issued the death decree and several Iranian leaders
put a $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head.
   Britain, along with about 12 Western allies, recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran to protest the fatwa. The European allies
resumed ties with Iran, but Tehran severed relations with London,
accusing it of trying to pressure Khomeini to revoke the death
decree.
   In Tehran today, an Iranian TV journalist deported along with an
Iran Air official and seven students, said it was no coincidence
that their expulsions came near the anniversary of Khomeini's death
decree.
   The London bureau chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting, identified only as Keivanara, told Tehran radio ``the
expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the
anniversary of the death order against Salman Rushdie.''
   Britain announced Feb. 1 that the nine had to be out within a
week for reasons of national security. It did not elaborate, but
similar expulsions in the past have been linked to the Rushdie
death decree.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Meets Arab Leaders Over Jewish Emigration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American diplomat met with high-ranking
officials of the PLO and the Arab League to discuss the emigration
of Soviet Jews to Israel, sources in the Tunisian capital reported
today.
   In Damascus, Syria, the Soviet ambassador suggested that Arab
nations take ``active steps'' against the United States to prevent
Soviet Jews from settling in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported today.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander Zotov did not specify what steps
should be taken and did not refer to the United States by name in
the statement he made to the agency Thursday.
   But he said, ``Arabs should take effective and active steps
against those Western nations who provide Israel with large
economic, financial and military aid which constitutes the
essential base for Israel to continue its expansionist and
aggressive policy and ignore the demands of the international
community.''
   The United States gives Israel $3 billion in aid annually, its
largest single beneficiary. The aid cannot be earmarked for use in
the occupied territories, but it amounts to a massive subsidy for
the Israeli budget.
   Zotov said the Soviet Union understands the distress of Arab
governments over Israel's plan over the next three years to settle
300,000 Soviet Jews in the territories it seized in the 1967
Mideast war. But he said Moscow cannot block Soviet citizens from
settling where they wish.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization wants to establish an
independent state in the territories and fears large-scale
settlement of Soviet Jews will make a negotiated settlement
impossible. The populations of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are
overwhelmingly Palestinian.
   The Palestinian uprising in the territories, now more than two
years old, has left more than 800 Palestinians and 40 Israelis dead.
   In Tunis, U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau met with PLO
official Hakim Balawi and with Arab League President Chedli Klibi,
sources said, as both organizations stepped up the campaign to
choke the emigration.
   The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the talks Thursday between
Pelletreau and Balawi covered ``the gravity and the repercussions
of the migration of Soviet Jews and their implantation in the
occupied Palestinian territories.''
   WAFA did not say whether Pelletreau and Balawi reached an
agreement. The U.S. Embassy, the sole American body authorized to
talk with the PLO, never comments on such meetings.
   Sources close to the Arab League said Klibi and Pelletreau
discussed the league's plan to send a delegation to Moscow,
Washington and the European Community to press for cuts in Soviet
Jewish emigration.
   A senior aide of PLO leader Yasser Arafat was quoted today as
warning that the influx of Soviet Jews into Israel might encourage
Israel to invade Jordan as part of its endeavor to create ``Greater
Israel.''
   Arafat spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif also warned that Israel would
force Palestinians out of the occupied territories to make way for
the influx.
   ``The Soviet Jewish immigration will form a new army that helps
Israel to realize the expansionist dreams of the Israeli prime
minister,'' he told the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anbaa from PLO
headquarters in Tunis.

   Twenty-two senior anti-apartheid
leaders met with Nelson Mandela today for a political strategy
session. Johannesburg police clubbed peaceful demonstrators marking
their first week of new freedoms.
   Also today, President F.W. de Klerk warned that conservative
whites who have criticized the concessions he announced last week
could ignite a racial war in South Africa.
   Police beat and chased hundreds of blacks through the streets of
downtown Johannesburg after the blacks spilled out of St. Mary's
Anglican Church dancing and singing freedom songs.
   About 1,000 people had been marking last week's legalization of
the African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   A policeman ordered the crowd to disperse, but within seconds
his fellow officers converged on the activists from both sides and
began hitting them with clubs.
   Police chased fleeing demonstrators through busy downtown
streets, toppling the stalls of vendors and forcing cars to come to
screeching halts.
   In several instances, police surrounded unarmed demonstrators
and hit them five or more times with their batons. Police arrested
several people and several more were hurt.
   Some activists threw bottles and rocks at the police after they
began hitting the demonstrators.
   De Klerk has said his government will permit peaceful protest if
permission is sought from authorities in advance. On several recent
occasions police have forcibly dispersed peaceful crowds, calling
the demonstrations illegal.
   On Feb. 2, in a speech that opened a new era in South African
politics, de Klerk also lifted restrictions on internal opposition
groups, ended a 30-year ban on Mandela's African National Congress
and pledged to free Mandela soon.
   At Victor Verster prison farm, the largest delegation yet to see
Mandela at his home included most members of the executive
committee of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition.
   ``His feeling was, at the end of the meeting ... how he wished
he could come home with us,'' said Murphy Morobe, one of the
front's chief spokesmen. Mandela and his visitors ended the session
by singing ``God Bless Africa,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid
movement.
   The delegates presented Mandela with a policy document saying
negotiations with the government could start only after democratic,
non-racial elections to form an assembly that would draft a new
constitution. De Klerk has rejected this demand.
   Morobe said on his way into the prison farm that he was ``very
hopeful'' this could be the last meeting in prison between Mandela
and South African activists.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson tentatively plans to meet Mandela on
Monday as part of his 12-day visit to South Africa. The government
has not confirmed that this meeting will take place, nor has it
confirmed reports that the American civil rights leader will meet
de Klerk on Monday.
   Mandela, 71, is the most popular leader among South Africa's
disenfranchised black majority and has offered to serve as mediator
in talks between the government and the ANC. He has been jailed
since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan the
start of the ANC's guerrilla campaign.
   The leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, Andries
Treurnicht, introduced a no-confidence motion Friday in Parliament
and denounced de Klerk's moves to open talks with the ANC.
   Treurnicht contended that the security forces had been
instructed to view right-wing whites, rather than the ANC, as the
government's principal enemy.
   ``Who is being monitored now? Not the terrorists, not the
infiltrators, but our people,'' Treurnicht said.
   The Conservative Party has threatened to employ militant tactics
to force de Klerk to call an election so whites can express their
views on his moves.
   In Parliament, de Klerk for the first time responded publicly to
the right-wing criticism and warned that the Conservatives ``will
plunge this country into racial war.''
   De Klerk defended himself and his National Party in a
no-confidence debate.
   ``The National Party talks of renewal and courage, and they talk
of racism and aggression,'' he said.
   De Klerk said his own party ``will still be here 10 to 20 years
from now, looking after the interests of its people and cooperating
with the leaders of other people.''
   De Klerk said his National Party had recognized that a ban on
the ANC and the South African Communist Party ``had the effect of
drawing attention away from their faults. At the same time, it was
a stumbling block in the path of the politics of negotiation.''
   Meanwhile, the anti-apartheid National Sports Council said a
tour by an English cricket team was provoking violence and urged
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to order the players home.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pledged to press on with more reforms
once he implements the limits on Communist Party power he persuaded
the party leadership to adopt. ``Once we have solidified this
phase, we will move on,'' he said. He skirted a question about
whether he would run for president if the country implements a new,
stronger office chosen in a contested election.
   In the Baltics, Lithuania's parliament declared that its 1940
annexation by the Soviet Union was ``unlawful and invalid.'' The
official news agency Tass said today that the move earlier this
week was a step toward secession. The Lithuanians, whose Communist
Party broke with the Kremlin in December, said they want to start
talks with Moscow on Lithuanian independence.

<HEAD>Former Communists Threaten to Walk Out of Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ex-Communist members of Parliament
threatened to walk out of the chamber today after a Solidarity
deputy suggested they had no moral right to vote on the design of
Poland's new official emblem.
   The emblem _ a crowned white eagle on a red background _ will
replace the uncrowned white eagle that decorated government offices
and official documents during the 45 years of Communist rule after
World War II.
   Parliament in December voted to restore the pre-war crown,
symbolizing Poland's sovereignty. The vote today in the Sejm,
Parliament's lower house, was on the specific pattern of the emblem.
   Despite heated appeals by religious-oriented deputies,
Parliament rejected a design change that would have included a
small cross on the crown.
   Solidarity Deputy Jan Lopuszanski then rose to address the 173
Parliament members elected to seats guaranteed last year to the
now-dissolved Communist Party.
   ``I have a moral appeal to the left side of the hall, I think
that this voting should take place without you. I think you would
be right to abstain from voting on this issue,'' he said.
   The appeal was met by murmurings in the hall, with about a dozen
of the ex-Communist deputies rising as if to leave.
   Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz immediately called a short
recess to avert a walkout.
   In recent months, there has been an increasing questioning of
the legitimacy of the ex-Communist deputies, who now have become
independent or joined one of two new social-democratic parties.
   They were elected to seats set aside for Communist Party members
under last year's talks.
   The agreement reached in April by the Communists and the
then-opposition set up what were at the time the most democratic
elections in East bloc history.
   Poles voted June 2 on candidates for a new, completely freely
elected Senate and 161 Sejm seats. The Communist candidates won
none of the freely contested seats.

restrictions can now be removed.''

that they contracted cancer and other diseases from nuclear weapons
testing.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Foley on Thursday rejected a
government appeal of his earlier ruling stripping government
immunity from the lawsuits, and ordered both sides to determine by
mid-May which of the 400 cases should go to trial.
   In denying the appeal, Foley had harsh words for a government he
said once felt it had the right to ``sacrifice its citizens at the
nuclear altar.''
   ``Thank God the government has found its conscience,'' Foley
said in a ruling that was greeted with applause by family and
friends of the former workers who crowded into the courtroom.
   Foley said Thursday that evolving legal precedent and a
heightened awareness among federal lawmakers have made such claims
``a whole new ball game'' and said a trial should be held as soon
as possible.
   ``I don't see any basis for trotting this issue back to the
court of appeals,'' the judge said.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs, who first filed suit in 1980, said
the ruling may bring the case to trial by early next year.
   ``This is a big day for us,'' said Stewart Udall.
   Udall and fellow attorney Larry Johns said they plan to select
six litigants as a representative sample for the trial, including
former test site employee Keith Prescott, who first sued for $101
million in May 1980.
   Prescott, now 64, worked at the nuclear proving ground from 1961
to 1968 and later developed multiple myeloma, a disease that
destroys bone marrow.
   The original litigation included 220 former test site workers _
all but 18 of whom are now dead _ but was later expanded to about
400 plaintiffs who are seeking more than $1 billion in damages.
   Foley, in his ruling, had harsh words for the government's
management of the nuclear testing program.
   ``At the highest level of government it was believed and decided
that national security required for human safety to be subjugated
to the greater national need of the nuclear weapons test,'' he said.
   Foley said minutes of an Atomic Energy Commission meeting
unearthed in another test site suit revealed the government's did
not want to warn its citizens of the perils of nuclear testing
``because they'll raise a protest ... they must be sacrificed.''
   Although Foley suggested that some surviving workers be included
in the group, Johns said that may not be possible.
   ``Not too many are still alive,'' he said. ``Cancer is a fatal
disease. That's the reality.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
will make an unscheduled stop in Romania this weekend after his
trip to Moscow, the government announced today.
   Baker would be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit
Romania since the December revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   It would follow strong U.S. criticism of the provisional
government's attempts to impede opposition parties taking part in
the May 20 general election.
   Dan Radulescu, spokesman for the governing National Salvation
Front, said Baker would spend ``a few hours'' in Bucharest,
probably Sunday morning.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler recently
indicated that Baker would not stop in Romania because his presence
might give the wrong signals about U.S. support in the campaign.
   Baker met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow
today for a third day of arms control discussions.
   Baker's visit to Romania was announced as the new Council of
National Unity, which gives 29 opposition parties a voice in
running Romania until the May election, was holding its inaugural
meeting.
   The 180-member council replaces the seven-member ruling council
of the National Salvation Front, which came to power at the height
of the revolution.
   The front, which has transformed itself into a political
movement to contest the election, is considered the front-runner
because of its role in overthrowing Ceausescu.
   The National Peasant Party, the largest opposition party, said
it fears the front will try to control the new council and give
seats to high-ranking Communists.
   The front expanded the ruling council to include more opposition
members after widespread criticism of an anti-opposition
demonstration that appeared to have been orchestrated by the
provisional government. The United States was among the nations
issuing criticism.
   The United States has been criticized in Romania for not giving
enough help to the country following the revolution, the only one
of the six revolts against hard-line communism in Eastern Europe
that became a bloodbath.
   Ion Radulescu, who was appointed by the front to coordinate
foreign relief, said the biggest donors have been France, Belgium,
Holland, West Germany, Italy, Soviet Moldavia, which has a large
ethnic Romanian population, and other East bloc countries.
   ``From the United States ... we are still waiting,'' he said.
   The United States gave $500,000 worth of aid to the
International Committee of the Red Cross for Romania and donated
$250,000 in medicine plus $25,000 from the U.S. ambassador's
discretionary fund.
   ``The problem is that we didn't put red, white and blue on our
aid,'' said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Agota Kuperman.
   In the last two weeks, Bruce Gelb, head of the U.S. Information
Agency, and Richard Schifter, assistant Secretary of State for
human rights and humanitarian affairs, have visited Bucharest and
met leading government and opposition figures.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met for nearly four hours
today and Gorbachev said President Bush's proposal for reducing
troops in Europe deserves ``very serious consideration.''
   Baker and senior aides were in their third day of talks with
Gorbachev and other Kremlin leaders on arms control and other
issues in advance of an expected superpower summit next summer.
   Gorbachev and Baker, accompanied by close aides, met for one
hour and 45 minutes and then the two met for another two hours
without aides.
   Baker saw Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before
and after his meetings with Gorbachev. U.S. officials said their
focus was on arms control, which experts from the two sides tried
to advance during the day at their own meetings.
   Shevardnadze said the ``discussion of the disarmament problem is
proceeding very well.''
   At the start of today's meeting with Baker, Gorbachev praised
Bush's troop-reduction proposal for cutting the number of U.S. and
Soviet troops in Europe. ``It merits very, very serious
consideration,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader has called in the past for even broader
disarmament measures. Asked if Bush should have gone further than
to propose leaving 225,000 American and Soviet troops in Europe,
Gorbachev said:
   ``I don't know. It's up to the U.S. government to make its own
proposal. It would be good if we cooperate, just as we are
cooperating now.''
   The Soviet leader appeared relaxed as he shook hands with Baker
and a half dozen U.S. officials.
   Baker ends his visit here Saturday and will fly to Bucharest,
Romania, where that government says he will spend ``a few hours,''
probably Sunday morning. The State Department earlier had indicated
Baker would not stop in Romania because of U.S. criticism of the
provisional government's attempts to impede opposition parties
taking part in the May 20 elections.
   Before today's sessions with Gorbachev, Baker met with
Shevardnadze, who told reporters, ``I think we may speak of
progress at the talks.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh told Tass, the
Soviet news agency, said the talks had a ``particularly
businesslike and constructive character.''
   Baker was eager to hear Gorbachev's assessment of Bush's
proposal to cut troops.
   So far, the reaction from Shevardnadze and other Soviet
officials on a proposal by President Bush to limit both sides'
troops, tanks and non-nuclear airplanes in Europe has been
positive. But Gorbachev, whose own disarmament goals are more
ambitious, had the opportunity in today's meeting to push for even
deeper cutbacks than Bush's proposal to limit both sides to 225,000.
   Bush's troop reduction proposal included limiting U.S. and
Soviet troops in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side. He
proposed allowing another 30,000 Americans elsewhere in Europe.
   Gorbachev spoke on a wide range of other issues before going
into his meeting with Baker today, including his own future as head
of the Communist Party now that the Central Committee has decided
to revoke the party's monopoly on power.
   Asked how the action would affect him, Gorbachev said ``I would
not think anything particular happened to me. What we wanted to
achieve at this plenum we did achieve,'' he said.
   He said the changes began when he came to power five years ago
and ``once we have solidified this phase we will move further.''
   Over two days of meetings, Baker and Shevardnadze made some
headway toward a treaty, as well as on another accord due for
signing at the Washington summit meeting in June to reduce
long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 percent
to 50 percent.
   On another front, the two sides are finding themselves in
agreement in opposing Israel's resettlement of Jewish immigrants
from the Soviet Union on the West Bank.
   ``It is quite possible that as a result of the Soviet-American
talks a common viewpoint will be expressed on this issue,
condemning Israel's attempt to resettle immigrants on someone
else's occupied territory,'' Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Thursday night. ``There are no
differences between the United States and us on this issue.''
   Shevardnadze and Bessmertnykh echoed the positive U.S. appraisal
of the arms control talks. ``The discussion of the disarmament
problem is proceeding very well,'' Shevardnadze told Tass.
   Baker offered at least one concession that would permit the
Soviets to exclude from a projected ceiling some of the combat
aircraft they contend are defensive.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, dropped their demand for a provision
that would allow them to scrap a treaty to reduce long-range
nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent if Moscow concluded
U.S. anti-missile defenses in space were illegal.
   But the U.S. official who reported the concession acknowledged
the treaty would include a common escape clause. Either side could
abandon the restrictions if it concluded the treaty did not serve
its national interest.
   The separate briefings produced evidence of discord, too.
   Gerasimov said the United States still refuses to consider
reducing naval forces. And he said the Soviets would not sign the
treaty if a dispute over sea-launched cruise missiles was not
resolved.
   Here, too, the Bush administration refuses to accept limits on
the weapons carried aboard nuclear submarines and surface ships.
   The net result of the talks so far is that the superpowers'
steadily more cooperative relationship apparently will not be
inhibited by the decisions at the Central Committee meeting.
   In fact, Shevardnadze said, ``It will mean that we have more
elements of trust in our relationship. We simply cannot afford
lowering our international activity.''

<HEAD>NRC OKs Low-Power License For Comanche Peak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TU Electric today began loading nuclear fuel at
Comanche Peak, the final, tedious step in the construction of the
twin-reactor plant that took 15 years and $9 billion to complete.
   The utility received a low-power testing license Thursday from
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which said it was satisfied with
the plant's safety.
   The license authorizes TU Electric to test Unit 1 of the plant
at up to 5 percent of full power.
   ``During that phase they will check things out, they will do a
lot of testing, checking things out. They cannot go to full power
without the commission's approval,'' NRC spokesman Bob Newlin said.
   ``Assuming these early operations are successfully conducted, in
about three months we will be able to gradually increase output and
be in full commercial operation this summer,'' said David Fiorelli,
a spokesman for the utility.
   Newlin, however, said he could not predict when the utility
would win a full-power license.
   The license action upset members of Citizens for Fair Utility
Regulation, a Fort Worth-based activist group that asked the NRC
Wednesday to indefinitely postpone licensing the plant.
   The group, which is also battling the plant in court, argues
that TU Electric managers have not learned how to recognize and
resolve serious safety problems at Comanche Peak. Betty Brink, a
group member, said she does not think the plant will ever operate
at full power, but if it does, ``I fear the very worst.''
   But the NRC, in a news release, said the safety questions have
been resolved satisfactorily.
   Construction on Comanche Peak began in 1975, and original
estimates put the total cost at $779 million. The facility's price
is now $9.1 billion. TU Electric serves 5 million customers in 85
counties in Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

   After denying for 40 years that it had
anything to do with the Nazis' extermination of 6 million Jews,
East Germany now admits responsibility for war crimes committed by
the German people.
   The decision adopted by the East German cabinet was conveyed in
a letter by Prime Minister Hans Modrow to the World Jewish
Congress. The East German government also has decided to compensate
survivors of the Nazi atrocities, according to the statement
released Thursday in the United States and in East Berlin.
   The shift in East Germany's position brings it a step closer to
West Germany, which in 1951 accepted full blame for the war crimes
of the Third Reich. West Germany has since paid $43 billion in
reparations to Israel, to Jewish organizations and to survivors and
their families.
   But East Germany until now rejected any share of the blame and
refused to compensate victims of the Nazis, arguing that the
country had only come into existence in 1949 and did not bear
responsibility for the deeds of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   The communists who founded East Germany had themselves been
persecuted by the Nazis and viewed themselves as victims rather
than perpetrators.
   ``The German Democratic Republic recognizes the responsibility
of the entire German people for the past,'' said the government
statement conveyed by Modrow in the letter to WJC President Edgar
Bronfman.
   ``This is a consequence of the deep guilt of Hitler fascism
which committed terrible crimes against the Jewish people in the
name of the German people,'' according to the statement.
   The GDR ``recognizes its humanitarian duty with regard to the
survivors of the Jewish people who suffered under Nazi oppression
and confirms its readiness to provide material support to former
persecutees of the Nazi regime of Jewish origin,'' the letter said.
   There are only about 4,000 Jews in East Germany and some 37,000
in the West _ down from a pre-war high of 530,000. Community
leaders have estimated that billions of dollars worth of Jewish
property was seized by the Nazis in what is now East Berlin.
   The GDR ``stands unaltered in its commitment to do everything
against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism and hatred among peoples,''
the statement said.
   East Germany is eager to establish ties with Israel and with the
Jewish community in the United States, apparently as a means of
attracting investments and U.S. support for its declining economy.
   Modrow urged Bronfman to visit East Germany soon ``in order to
further our common aims.''
   A WJC official said Bronfman probably would visit Modrow after
East Germany's first democratic elections, scheduled for March 18.
   ``The acceptance of the GDR of its historic moral responsibility
is an important first step'' toward speedy reparations for the
victims of the Nazis, the WJC said. Bronfman leaves for Israel next
week to discuss the development with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials today praised East Germany's
decision but said they want practical steps before forging ties
with that country.
   ``We have to ... chew a little bit on the wording of Modrow's
declaration. But obviously it is a beginning. I don't think we have
ever heard before this kind of a declaration from East Germany,''
said Michael Shilo, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official.
   At the initiation of East Germany, its representatives met last
week with Israeli officials in Copenhagen for preliminary talks on
establishing diplomatic relations.
   Israel said diplomatic relations would be contingent on East
Germany's acceptance ``of its share in the moral and historical
responsibility'' for the Nazis' persecution of Jews.
   Most of the Eastern European countries moving from communism
toward democracy have recently established diplomatic ties with
Israel.

   The government has canceled the work
permits of all foreign correspondents and ordered them to reapply
for accreditation.
   The measure also affects local journalists working for foreign
media in Uganda.
   Radio Uganda quoted Ben Otto of the Ministry of Information as
saying Thursday the government took the action to streamline
reporting by foreigners in the east African nation.
   There are 15 correspondents and local stringers for foreign
media in Uganda.
   It was not immediately clear if the order was related to
government charges that two local journalists defamed Zambia's
President Kenneth Kaunda at a news conference Jan. 29 in Kampala.
   A court in Uganda dismissed the charges Tuesday after defense
attorneys pointed out that the statute under which they were
brought required publication of the defamation.
   But Alfred Okware, 34, of the independent monthly magazine
Newsdesk, was held on another charge of being in possession of a
seditious article. Festo Ebong, 29, of the government-owned New
Vision newspaper, was rearrested without charge when leaving the
court.
   At the news conference Jan. 29, Okware asked Kaunda why he did
not consider relinguishing Zambia's presidency after 25 years in
power.
   Ebong asked Kaunda why Zambia's national airline flies from
Johannesburg to New York when the president is in the forefront of
those calling for sanctions against South Africa.

   A member of a right-wing group was formally charged
Friday with attempted murder in the shooting last month of the
mayor of Nagasaki, prosecutors said.
   The victim, Hitoshi Motoshima, had received death threats for
more than a year after saying that the late Emperor Hirohito bore
some responsibility for Japan's involvement in World War II.
   Local prosecutors said they filed attempted murder charges with
Nagasaki District Court against Kazumi Tajiri, 40, who has
reportedly confessed to shooting Motoshima in the back on Jan. 18.
   The 67-year-old mayor is in fair condition, his doctors said.
   Police said Tajiri told investigators he ``couldn't condone''
the mayor's comments about Hirohito and intended to punish
Motoshima, not kill him.
   Tajiri is a member of a rightist group called Seikijuku, or Sane
Thinkers' School, police said. Rightist groups in Japan rever the
imperial family.
   As Hirohito lay dying of cancer in December 1988, Motoshima
enraged many rightists by saying the emperor ``shares
responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that
period.''
   Hirohito died Jan. 7, 1988, at the age of 87. His involvement in
the war was never fully clarified.

   The government kept the city under curfew
and barred thousands of Moslems from gathering at weekly prayer
services on Friday, the Moslem sabbath, to prevent violence by
militant separatists.
   Despite the measures, two bombs exploded in Srinagar, a
stronghold of Moslem secessionists who seek independence for the
Moslem-dominated region of Kashmir. Officials said no one was
injured in the blasts.
   At least 82 people have been killed since Jan. 20 in frequent
street clashes between militants and security forces in Srinagar
and nearby areas of Kashmir. Most victims have been Moslem
protesters defying curfew.
   Srinagar District Magistrate Ghulam Abbas said one bomb exploded
in a post office at 9 a.m., before the staff arrived. The building
was severely damaged, he said.
   An hour later, another bomb blew up an empty bus parked at the
city terminal beside the tourist information center, Abbas said.
Two other buses parked nearby also were damaged, he said.
   The city imposed curfew from 11 a.m. and banned public assembly,
including the Friday prayers, in the city of 1 million.
   The prayers normally begin at 1:30 p.m., and officials say they
have been used to incite unrest. The city's leading Moslem
clergyman denounced the government decision.
   ``I strongly condemn the anit-Islamic act of state authorities
to impose day curfew consistently on Fridays for the last two
months to make Jumma (Friday) prayers impossible,'' Moulvi Mohammad
Farooq said in a statement.
   ``It is an attack on the fundamental right of worship, and I
appeal to ulemas (religious heads) and leaders in and outside the
country to raise their voice against it,'' he said.
   Despite the ban, many of the city's 200 mosques broadcast
prayers through their loudspeakers.
   Curfew was strictly enforced and only dogs and horses were seen
on the streets as paramilitary troops kept watch from bunkers at
major intersections.
   Kashmir is a part of the state of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only
Moslem-dominated state. It was divided into Indian and Pakistani
segments in 1948, a year after the countries gained independence
from Britain.
   India and Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir because of its
predominantly Moslem population, went to war over the region in
1965, but the border dispute remains unresolved.
   India accuses Pakistan of training and aiding the Kashmiri
militants, a charge that has been denied. Pakistan, however,
supports the separatism, calling it a struggle for
self-determination.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up only 12 percent of India's
population of 880 million.

<TEXT>
   An elderly woman who was the focus of a court
battle over her refusal to have lifesaving surgery has agreed to
have the operation, a relative said Friday.
   Ruth Trabelsi consented to the operation after a visit from
Mordechai Eliahu, chief rabbi of Israel's Sephardic Jews, said a
man who described himself as one of Mrs. Trabelsi's grandsons.
   ``The chief rabbi spoke to her ... explained the situation to
her. He came out with a positive answer,'' the grandson said in a
telephone interview from Poriah Hospital in Tiberias.
   He said doctors were planning to perform the operation later
Friday to remove the 84-year-old woman's gangrenous right foot.
   The case went to court Wednesday after Mrs. Trabelsi refused to
have the surgery, saying she wanted ``to enter the Garden of Eden
on both feet.''
   Doctors said she would probably die without the operation, and
the government went to court under a law that requires it to
protect people who may not be capable of making decisions for
themselves.
   The case was dropped Thursday after a geriatric specialist
testified that Mrs. Trabelsi was fully capable of making her own
decisions.
   But some of the woman's 258 children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, along with leading rabbis, said they would
continue pressing Mrs. Trabelsi to have surgery.
   The case was widely publicized in Israel and the subject of much
debate over the right to die. The broadcaster who announced the
outcome of the case Friday on Israel radio introduced it by saying,
``Now to the leg affair.''
   Rabbi Eliahu said he agreed to talk to Mrs. Trabelsi after the
family stopped arguing over the case.
   ``The family is all united ... Sometimes amputation is also
healing,'' Eliahu said on Israel radio.
   Eliahu said before his trip that he felt Mrs. Trabelsi should
accept doctors' advice to have her leg amputated. Rabbis who shared
his view said that if she refused, she would be violating religious
law by in effect comitting suicide.
   Other rabbis had argued that the surgery should not be forced on
Mrs. Trabelsi, who developed the gangrene in her right leg as a
complication from hardening of the arteries and blood clotting.

   Two only two Western reporters in Malawi
said the government ordered them to leave the south African nation
by midnight Friday but gave no reasons for the expulsions.
   Mike Hall, 27, of Britain, and Melinda Ham, 25, a Canadian, said
Thursday the government canceled their residence permits Monday and
gave them five days to leave.
   Hall, a reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp., Reuters and
the London Financial Times, and Ham, a stringer for The Associated
Press and a specialist African magazines, received permission to
report from Malawi in October 1988.
   They were the first Western journalists to receive government
accreditation to work here since the expulsion of a British
correspondent in 1971. He was ousted for what the government called
``negative reporting.''
   On Oct. 17, 1989, Hall and Ham were ordered out of the country
but were allowed to return three weeks later. No official reason
was given for that expulsion.
   Since the former British colony of Nyasaland became independent
Malawi in 1964, President-For-Life Hastings Kamuzu Banda has
shunned media attention and curbed activities of the local press.
   Several Malawian journalists have been detained without trial
and others have fled their homeland, alleging widespread human
rights violations.
   The United States has criticized Malawi's human rights record
but recently described the presence of Hall and Ham there as ``a
positive development.''

   A moderate earthquake shook the Algerian
capital Friday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties
or serious damage.
   Algeria's Center for Research in Astronomy, Astrophysics and
Geophysics said the quake struck at 10:31 a.m. and was centered
about 45 miles west of Algiers. It measured 4.8 on the Richter
scale.
   The earthquake lasted about 15 seconds and was followed almost
immediately by a smaller tremor.
   Several small tremors have been recorded in the Algiers region
over the past several weeks.
   On Oct. 29, an earthquake registering 6.0 on the Richter scale
struck west of Algiers and caused 30 deaths and hundreds of
injuries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

   Attackers believed to be leftist
guerrillas raided a suburban police station with rockets and
submachine-gun fire, and one police officer was killed and four
were wounded, authorities said Friday.
   Police said the attack was on a precinct of the investigative
police in San Ramon, a working class district in southern Santiago.
Police said several ``terrorists'' in a car launched the attack
Thursday shortly before midnight, injuring an officer standing
guard.
   Police gave chase and caught up with the attackers several
blocks away. In the ensuing gunfight, officer Jaime Gonzalez was
shot to death and three more officers were wounded, police said.
   The assailants fled.

<HEAD>Alleged `White Woman' Comment by Ann Richards Stirs Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards, who
gained national attention for a speech at the 1988 Democratic
National Convention, has stirred up controversy by seeming to refer
in a debate to a ``white woman.''
   Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, denies that she used the term
``white woman'' during Wednesday's debate among the three leading
Democratic candidates, saying her comment was misheard and she was
saying ``why a woman.''
   Rival Jim Mattox, state attorney general, said the comment shows
Ms. Richards represents the ``white, feminist fringe.'' That
prompted Ms. Richards' campaign manager, Glenn Smith, to say Mattox
had exceeded the ``bounds of decency.''
   At issue was an answer Ms. Richards gave during the televised
debate. Ms. Richards said she would veto a bill that would forbid
abortions for girls 16 years of age or younger.
   ``No legislator, no judge and no bureaucrat has any business in
determining whether a white woman has an abortion or not,'' she
appeared to say.
   After the debate, Ms. Richards said she didn't recall exactly
what word she used, but added that ``white women ... is not a
phrase that I use. I think what I said was `why women.' ''
   Smith insisted Thursday that Ms. Richards was saying ``whether
or why a woman'' in her answer.
   But Mattox said that his opponent had offended many Texans.
   ``Based on the comments last night, and based on the calls that
have been coming into my office, Ms. Richards owes the black and
Hispanic communities of Texas an apology. ... It's very clear that
in her mindset that she represents the white, feminist fringe in
Texas,'' Mattox told a Houston news conference Thursday.
   Smith said Mattox was panicking because of polls showing him
running third among Democrats in the March 13 primary. Incumbent
Republican Gov. Bill Clements is retiring.
   ``Mattox is acting desperate, but this goes beyond the bounds of
decency,'' Smith said, adding that Mattox should be criticized for
``injecting race into the campaign.''
   Neither Mattox nor the third leading Democratic candidate,
former Gov. Mark White, nor a panel of journalists questioned Ms.
Richards about the remark during their debate. The subject was
raised during a post-debate news conference.
   A spokesman for White called for clarification Thursday.
   ``I don't think Ann intended to make a racial slur. However, I
think that she needs to clarify what she said,'' said Gary Rasp,
White's press secretary.
   Ms. Richards made the keynote address during the 1988 Democratic
Convention, and poked fun at then-GOP presidential candidate George
Bush, saying he was born with ``a silver foot in his mouth.''

   Non-union truck drivers waited until federal
marshals left before taunting union strikers outside a coal
preparation plant wracked by confrontations between the two sides,
the chief marshal says.
   Chief U.S. Marshal Walt Biondi said the taunts were witnessed by
a deputy marshal who hid in a picket shack at Rum Creek Coal Sales
Inc. to see what would happen after the other marshals left.
   ``I'm extremely angry that after all we've tried to do to calm
the situation in the last two weeks, that this has happened,''
Biondi said.
   The chief marshal said he was told that the drivers made ``lewd
gestures'' to the strikers and used ``obscene language.''
   ``It just incenses me that something like this could occur,''
Biondi said. ``I was particularly angered after risking the safety
of my people and the reputation of my people down there to restore
calm.''
   The United Mine Workers have been picketing the Rum Creek Coal
plant since it reopened in August with non-union contractor
Con-Serv Inc. running it. A non-union trucking company also is used
to haul coal from the facility, which previously was worked by
union employees.
   Last month, strikers tried to block a bridge leading into the
plant with their cars, and truck drivers for several days pushed
through the barricade, damaging cars and injuring several strikers.
   The union criticized federal marshals for not stopping the
trucks and claimed the government was siding with Rum Creek Coal
Sales, a charge Biondi has denied.
   A UMW official said Thursday's incident supports the union's
long-standing accusations about company-provoked violence.
   ``What we've been alleging all along is that these people are
there to provoke us,'' said Howard Green, the District 17
international executive board representative.
   Con-Serv Vice President Mike Holbrook said he doesn't condone
the truckers' action but understands it.
   ``Both sides do it. I get the finger daily every time I cross
the picket line. That's just a fact of life on Rum Creek,''
Holbrook said.
   The UMW and Rum Creek Coal Sales are holding closed-door
negotiations aimed at settling the dispute.

<TEXT>
   Most of the 31 senators up for re-election in
November began the year with bulging campaign war chests, with
nearly half having at least $1 million on hand and one a whopping
$6 million.
   The fund-raising kingpin was Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, who
has raised more than $10 million since his 1984 election and began
the year with $6.1 million, according to reports filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   An analysis of those reports, released Friday by Common Cause,
said political action committees have played a significant role in
helping incumbents gain huge fund-raising edges over most potential
challengers.
   Indeed, 25 of the 31 senators facing re-election this year have
accepted PAC donations that would exceed PAC contribution limits
included in a campaign finance reform proposal being pushed by the
public interest group.
   The closest senator to Gramm in terms of fund-raising prowess
was New Jersey Democrat Bill Bradley, who is expected to coast to
re-election and is often mentioned as a possible presidential
contender in 1992.
   Bradley told the FEC he had $4.1 million on hand as of Dec. 31.
   The poorest of the 31 was Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
who has raised just $90,860 since 1984 and began 1990 with $157,817
in campaign funds.
   A breakdown of PAC donations provided in the Common Cause
analysis supports the organization's claim that PACs are providing
hefty assistance to most incumbents.
   Of the 14 senators who began the year with more than $1 million,
Democrat David Boren of Oklahoma was the only one who has not
accepted any PAC donations. Of all 31, only Boren and Democrat John
Kerry of Massachusetts _ who had $874,000 in campaign funds as of
Dec. 31 _ accepted no PAC money.
   Of the 29 whose campaigns took PAC money, Gramm was again the
leader, receiving $1.1 million from PACs in the last six years,
according to Common Cause. Illinois Democrat Paul Simon was not far
behind, reporting $976,769 in PAC contributions since the 1984
election.
   At the bottom of the PAC list _ except for Boren and Kerry _ was
Kassebaum, who has accepted $19,250 from PACs since 1984.
   Simon faces a tough challenge from Republican Rep. Lynn Martin,
who leads all Senate challengers with about $800,000 in campaign
funds. Three other House Republicans challenging or expected to
challenge incumbent Democratic senators, Bill Schuette of Michigan,
Thomas Tauke of Iowa and Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island,
trailed the incumbents in fund-raising but not by as large a margin
as most of the lesser-known challengers.
   Schuette, who faces a primary in his effort to challenge Sen.
Carl Levin, had about $350,000 on hand to begin the year while
Levin had $2.3 million. Tauke, trying to unseat Sen. Tom Harkin,
had $300,000 to beging the year while Harkin had $1.1 million.
   Schneider began the year with about $540,000 in the bank, not
far behind Sen. Claiborne Pell, who had nearly $650,000. Schneider
is expected to announce her candidacy soon.
   Common Cause said the 31 incumbent senators together raised
$77.4 million since all but one last faced election six years ago,
with $16.6 million of that total coming from PACs.
   The only senator in the group not involved in a 1984 Senate
election was Republican Dan Coats of Indiana, who 13 months ago was
appointed to fill the seat vacated by Vice President Dan Quayle.

   A crowded commuter train slammed
into the rear of another early Friday, killing five people and
injuring 70 others, a railway spokeswoman said.
   The accident occurred at 7:30 a.m. near the Oswaldo Cruz station
10 miles northwest of Rio's main downtown station, spokeswoman Jane
Pellizone said.
   ``One train was stopped at a signal and the other rammed it from
behind. We don't know if it was a faulty signal or human error,''
Ms. Pellizone said.
   The trains had eight cars each and were packed for the morning
rush hour, she said. All the deaths occurred on the moving train.
It was not known how fast the train was going when it hit the other.
   Most of the injured passengers were treated for scratches and
released, but 18 were hospitalized with serious injuries, said Ms.
Pellizone.

<HEAD>Bush Cites Philosophical Commitment to Return More Power to States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with Bush comments; picks up 3rd graf pvs,

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he has a ``broad
philosophical commitment'' to returning more political power to the
states and vowed to help them in cutting federal red tape.
   Speaking to a group of state legislators at the White House, the
president praised state and local governments for ``looking for new
approaches for solving old problems.''
   He spoke as a report by the National Conference of State
Legislatures said that half of the states face deficits or
unexpectedly low revenues.
   At the same time, only a few of these states are likely to
resort to election-year tax increases, the conference said in its
report.
   Bush told the state lawmakers not to expect quick fixes from
Washington for pressing problems.
   He noted his new federal budget contains increased money for
education and for ``financing experimentation in the states.''
   And he promised to help find ways of making federal regulations
less burdensome on states. ``More federal money should not, in my
view, automatically mean more federal management,'' he said.
   But Bush said that, in the long run, more political power needs
to be returned to the states, vowing ``further implementation of
this broad philosophical commitment to federalism.''
   Federalism is the word the Reagan administration used for a
variety of proposals to transfer programs _ and the associated
costs _ from the federal government to states.
   In its report on state finances halfway through the 1990 fiscal
year, the organization of state legislatures said on Thursday that
slower revenue growth in the states is attributable to both
regional economic problems and a general slowdown.
   The most severe financial problems are in the Northeast and New
England states, but mid-Altantic and Southeastern states face
shortfalls as well.
   ``Funding for education, for Medicaid and for expanding prison
capacity will be at the top of the agendas in many states,'' said
Lee Daniels, a Republican who is president of the National
Conference of State Legislatures and minority leader of the
Illinois House.
   ``But finding funds for these purposes will be more difficult
than in the past few years, with half the states reporting slow
economic growth is reducing revenue below projections for the
current fiscal year,'' he said.
   The conference, an organization of lawmakers from all 50 states,
released its report on state fiscal conditions as it held a
leadership meeting in Washington.
   Only a few states are likely to impose election-year tax
increases, the group said. But it predicted more tax increases in
1991, particularly if the economy declines.
   The report said potential deficits are expected by the end of
fiscal 1990 in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
New York, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Massachusetts, where Gov. Michael Dukakis pointed to as an
example of strong economic growth when he was the 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee, ``suffers the states' most spectacular
problems,'' according to the report. Its deficit may reach 10
percent, despite tax increases last year.
   In all of those states, governors and legislatures have moved to
reduce spending and some are considering increased taxes, the group
said.
   Arizona and a few Midwest states joined the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic states in facing possible revenue shortfalls in fiscal
1990 _ that is, revenue collections are running below projections,
although reserves may be sufficient to make up the difference.
   Those states were: Maine, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
Florida, Missouri, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota,
Montana, Wyoming and Arizona.
   ``The recession that has crippled budgets in the Northeastern
states remains regional, but a slowing revenue stream is creating
difficulties for most of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states
as well,'' the report said. ``Far Western states are generally in
good condition, as are many of the states in the nation's
heartland.''
   Some of the farm states that faced economic hardship and tax
increases in the 1980s have seen an upturn, the report said. Energy
states, which saw their state finances crash with their economies
in the 1980s, are stabilizing, the report said _ although it said
Louisiana's 1990 surplus was based on temporary tax measures.
   The report said significant tax increases are likely in 1990 in
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Louisiana, and Arizona.
Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas are considering increases for public
education.

   Middle-aged blacks die at a rate more than twice
that of whites, but income is a major factor in the difference,
according to a government study published today.
   A 13-year study by the national Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta found that blacks between the ages of 35 and 54 die at a
rate 2.5 times greater than that of whites in the same age group,
according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   It said 38 percent of the difference in the death rates between
the races can be attributed to income disparity.
   ``That's a big proportion to be concerned about because it's not
something that public health workers and physicians can do much
about,'' said Dr. Mac W. Otten, an epidemiologist at the CDC and
one of the authors of the study.
   ``Those are issues for health policy makers and political
officials,'' Otten said in a telephone interview Thursday night.
``We need health policy makers to seriously study those factors
related to income.''
   Otten said lower-income people may have less access to
prevention services, such as screening for cervical cancer with Pap
smears, or for breast cancer with mammograms; screening for
diseases like diabetes or hypertension; disease prevention programs
for weight control or stopping smoking; and educational efforts to
reduce risks that can be prevented.
   The study said another 31 percent of the difference in the death
rate for blacks can be explained by their higher incidence of
disease from preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure,
alcohol consumption and smoking.
   Researchers said the other 31 percent of the difference in death
rates is unexplained, though part of it may be due to lack of
access to health care or factors they didn't study, such as
exercise.
   He said researchers studied data collected between 1971 and 1984
from 8,806 black and white Amercans living in rural and nonrural
areas and in communities of all sizes.
   ``The causes of death among blacks were the same as in the
general population _ heart disease, strokes, cancer and so on _
they are dying of the same things only at higher rates,'' Otten
said. ``Violence and homicides did not contribute to the excess
death rate.''
   Otten said researchers adjusted death rates within the study
group for family income and for the preventable risk factors of
smoking, blood pressure, weight, diabetes, cholesterol level and
alcohol intake to come up with their conclusion.
   It has been known that blacks in most age groups die at rates
much higher than those of whites.
   But the national study broke ground by quantifying the
importance income plays in the different death rates between the
races, Otten said. The study also marked the first time the effects
of high blood pressure, diabetes and other risk factors were
quantified to explain the difference in death rates, he said.
   Black medical leaders around the country said Thursday that the
study will help overcome the perception that blacks lead
unhealthier lifestyles.
   ``The time has come to consider universal entitlement to health
care in this country,'' said Dr. James A. Goodman, president of
Atlanta's predominantly black Morehouse School of Medicine.
   Dr. Bailus Walker, former president of the American Public
Health Association, said that poverty's dominant role in preventing
access to health care means that ``tinkering with the system _
expanding Medicaid to this group, granting catastrophic care to
that group _ will no longer work.''

   Del Shannon, whose distinctive
falsetto style on such rock classics as ``Runaway'' and ``Keep
Searchin''' pushed him to the top of the charts in the 1960s, was
found dead in his home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot
wound, authorities said today. He was 55.
   Shannon's wife, Bonnie, found her singer-songwriter husband's
body at about 11:25 p.m. Thursday with a bullet wound to the head,
said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom.
   A .22-caliber rifle was found next to Shannon's body in the den,
Hom said. He said the death was being investigated as a possible
suicide, but the exact cause of death had not been established by
coroner's officials.
   Shannon was born Charles Westover in Grand Rapids, Mich., on
Dec. 30, 1934, according to coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   Dambacher said an autopsy would be conducted over the weekend.
   Shannon's first and biggest hit was ``Runaway,'' recorded
shortly after his discovery by Detroit agents Harry Balk and Irving
Micahnik. As with many of his songs, it dealt with the pain of
young love gone astray.
   The single made No. 1 in the United States in early 1961.
   His other Top 20 singles included ``Hats Off to Larry,''
``Little Town Flirt'' and ``Keep Searchin'.''
   Shannon's popularity declined in the mid-1960s, but English duo
Peter and Gordon gained success with his ``I Go to Pieces.''
   He tried varying his sharp, early 1960s sound by recording with
producer Andrew Loog Oldham toward the end of the decade, but it
was a commercial failure.
   In 1982, he signed a new contract with Elektra records, which
released his album ``Drop Down and Get Me,'' produced by longtime
admirer Tom Petty. That album met with critical approval but did
not sell significantly. In 1986, television producer Michael Mann
had Shannon re-record ``Runaway'' with new lyrics for the series
``Crime Story.''
   In a recent interview, he discussed the stress of having a flash
of fame in the music industry.
   ``This business will eat you up,'' he said. ``If it becomes your
love and you don't have humans to love, I think you're in a lot of
trouble.''
   Santa Clarita is about 35 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.

   Black protesters spent the night in City Hall
and Selma High School, then locked the doors of the school this
morning while all public schools in the city were closed for a
third day because of a racial protest.
   Police said they had no reports of problems during the night,
during which about 150 black students and adults, some in sleeping
bags, camped out in the high school cafeteria. About 50 others
spent the night in City Hall.
   Police made no immediate effort to enter the high school this
morning after the protesters locked the doors. J.L. Chestnut, a
Selma lawyer helping negotiate for the protesters, urged caution.
   ``If they go in there to arrest somebody, all kinds of things
may very well happen,'' said Chestnut.
   Black protests have escalated since six white members of the
11-member Selma School Board voted last week to dismiss Schools
Superintendent Norward Roussell, who is black.
   The board voted Tuesday to rescind its action, but by then the
protests had widened to include other issues, including police
treatment of a woman protesting the superintendant's ouster.
   On Thursday, school officials announced that all 11 public
schools would remain closed until Monday.
   Thursday night, a mostly white group of nearly 1,000 parents
arrived at the high school for a meeting but had to go to another
school because black students blocked the entrances to the high
school. Witnesses said there was no friction between the two groups.
   Diane Crisman, a leader of the parents' group, said, ``We were
just told by some adults that that group had as much right to
occupy the building as we had to meet there.''
   Rose Sanders, a black protest leader who claimed a white
policeman abused her during an arrest Monday, said the protest
should spotlight education as next month's 25th anniversary of the
1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march approaches.
   ``I think the focus has to be on separate and unequal
education,'' said Mrs. Sanders, a Selma lawyer.
   She has said Officer Ronnie Rushing touched her ``private
parts'' with his billy stick as she was dragged to police
headquarters earlier this week.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman said a report would be released this
afternoon on the arrest of Mrs. Sanders and three others on
misdemeanor charges after they entered his offices to protest the
dismissal of Roussell. He said Rushing had been reassigned pending
an investigation of the confrontation.
   The mayor earlier said Rushing was injured by Mrs. Sanders when
she forced police to physically remove her from City Hall. Mrs.
Sanders was briefly hospitalized after the incident.
   Scores of blacks crowded into City Hall corridors Thursday,
promising not to leave until Rushing is suspended. Hundreds of
students and adults settled in at Selma High.
   ``We as students are sick and tired of being sick and tired,''
Catrena Norris, a 1986 graduate of the high school, told The Selma
Times-Journal. ``We're here, and we won't leave until our demands
are met.''
   Mrs. Sanders was released Thursday as protest leaders turned the
spotlight on her case. Her husband, state Sen. Hank Sanders, has
said he would ``use any means necessary'' to personally respond to
abuse of his wife.
   ``I admire what he's doing as a husband, but I don't think we
can lose sight of the issue,'' Mrs. Sanders said. ``The issue is
not Roussell, not me, because many communities have the same
problem, unequal education. I'm hoping other people will take a
close look at their school systems.''

<TEXT>
   A committee of blacks has sued the county
school board, charging the district discriminates against minority
middle school children.
   The lawsuit by the Committee of Organized Groups asks that the
district give every black middle school student an individualized
education plan.
   ``What has become clear is that in regular education,
particularly black and Hispanic children are simply ignored,'' said
attorney Gabe Kaimowitz, who filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal
court in Orlando.
   The individual plans created by guidance counselors, parents and
psychologists now are written only for students in
special-education classes. The committee wants similar plans for
black middle school students to ``eliminate the last vestiges of
the dual school system,'' said Kaimowitz.
   Orange County middle schools have about 22,000 students, and
about 24 percent are black.
   Superintendent James Schott said writing individual plans would
be costly and cumbersome.
   Kindergartners and new students up to third grade are evaluated
and placed depending on their needs, Schott said. Teachers and
counselors do similar evaulations throughout a student's schooling,
he added.

   The governing party and two opposition
groups completed a merger Friday that gives them a huge majority in
Parliament, and radical students responded with protests, firebombs
and rocks.
   Kim Dae-jung, who leads the leftist Party for Peace and
Democracy, the largest opposition faction, called the merger ``a
kind of coup d'etat that reversed the people's will.''
   The new Democratic Liberal Party, a conservative group, will
have at least 210 of the 299 seats in the single-house National
Assembly, well over the two-thirds needed to pass constitutional
amendments. Kim Dae-jung's party and the two defecting opposition
groups previously held a majority.
   Yonhap, the national news agency, said about 1,000 students in
Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, fought police after an
anti-government campus rally at Chonam University.
   Kwangju is Kim Dae-jung's base and was the scene of a 1980
student uprising in which soldiers killed 200 people, by official
count. Unofficial estimates put the total much higher.
   Friday's battle began when about 1,000 riot police, backed by
armored vans with multiple tear gas launchers, stormed the campus
to stop a rally acy. It was a miscalculation and disregarded the
people's power.''
   He said many voters ``feel betrayed'' now that opposition
legislators they elected have joined the government.
   Insiders said collective leadership of the new party would
continue until a single leader was chosen at a convention in April.
   A senior party official said Kim Young-sam would be made party
chief at the convention. Kim, 62, is considered a likely successor
to the presidency when Roh's single term ends in February 1993.
   Analysts expect the party to amend the constitution next year to
replace the current presidential system with a parliamentary system
headed by a prime minister.

   Federal agents investigating a series of mail
bombings searched the home of a self-employed editor and writing
adviser who was convicted in a 1972 explosives case, according to
reports published today.
   The Atlanta Constitution quoted federal sources as saying agents
seized string, tape and brown paper in a search of a house in this
Atlanta suburb. The mail bombs were wrapped in paper and tape and
tied with string. Agents also reportedly seized a typewriter from a
business in Alabama.
   Although the FBI would not identify the Georgia property or its
owner, both the Constitution and The New York Times reported that
the agency's search warrants targeted the property of Walter Leroy
Moody Jr. The Times said the papers also named his wife, Susan
McBride Moody.
   ``Agents searched a house, storage area and three vehicles.
There were no arrests,'' said Nestor Michnyak, an FBI spokesman in
Washington. He would not say if authorities knew the whereabouts of
the property's owner or give other details.
   Neighbors said investigators have been in the Clayton County
town, about 25 miles south of Atlanta, for weeks but there were no
visible signs of them this morning.
   The FBI, has spent about three weeks investigating two men in
Enterprise, Ala., for possible links to the bombings.
   Ten miles away in Elba, Ala., FBI agents searched the Dorsey
Trailer Co. ib Thursday, according to its general manager, Nick
Culich. He declined to give details, but WAGA-TV in Atlanta quoted
an unidentified employee of the company as saying he was told the
agents seized a typewriter. Agents have been looking for a
typewriter to match typed followup letters to the bombings.
   In their reports today, the two newspapers said the 54-year-old
Moody, a self-employed editor and writing adviser, was convicted in
1972 of felony possession of an unregistered firearm for having a
bomb that officials said was to be used in a failed extortion
scheme.
   Prosecutors claimed Moody had planned to send the bomb, along
with an extortion note demanding $65,000, to an Atlanta auto dealer
who had repossessed his car. But the bomb exploded when Moody's
then-wife, Hazel, opened the package. She lost part of a finger and
a portion of a thigh.
   Moody served two years in prison.
   Appeals of that conviction went to the 11th Circuit court, which
turned the appeal down in June, the Times said.
   In December, an 11th Circuit judge, Robert Vance of Mountain
Brook, Ala., was killed by a bomb delivered to his home. Another
bomb killed Robert Robinson, a Savannah city councilman and
attorney who did work for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Two other bombs were intercepted, one mailed to the 11th Circuit
in Atlanta and one to the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The Times, quoting an unidentified official, said there were
similarities between the mail bombs and the bomb in the Moody case
in 1972.
   The Constitution said today that Moody was charged in 1983 with
three counts of attempted murder involving a diving expedition in
the Gulf of Mexico. The case ended in a mistrial when the jury
deadlocked.
   WSB-TV in Atlanta said its reporters saw FBI, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and Postal Service agents carry boxes of
unidentified material out of a house in Rex.
   The station said the agents also searched ``what appeared to be
a makeshift base of operations behind a nearby church.''
   A longtime resident of Rex, Evelyn Rogers, said today that FBI
and Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents had turned a local
convenience store into a temporary headquarters all week.
   But there were no signs of agents there today, and a employee of
the store refused to comment.
   Mrs. Rogers said she first heard of Moody several weeks ago when
a friend noticed that agents were searching a van near his property.
   In addition to the searches here, authorities conducted a widely
publiziced investigation in Enterprise, Ala., focusing on Robert
Wayne O'Ferrell, a salvage store owner, and Brian Joseph Fleming, a
print shop owner.
   Authorities said a typewritten letter O'Ferrell sent in
connection with a civil lawsuit appealed to the 11th Circuit
matched typewriting in a letter claiming responsibility for the
bombs.
   O'Ferrell said that he apparently sold the typewriter from his
salvage store. He denied having anything to do with the bombings.

<HEAD>US Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against AMA in Chiropractors'
Lawsuit</HEAD>

actions were primarily sincere, but economic reasons also a factor.

<TEXT>
   The head of a national chiropractors group today
hailed a appeals court's decision to uphold a 1987 ruling that the
American Medical Association illegally attempted to destroy his
profession.
   The ruling will ``make up for years of oppression chiropractors
have suffered from the AMA,'' Louis Sportelli, chairman of the
American Chiropractic Association, said in a telephone interview
today.
   ``There's no question about the fact that the ruling paves the
way for chiropractic to proceed without hindrance,'' Sportelli said.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday affirmed the
finding of U.S. District Judge Susan Getzendanner, who found the
AMA boycott of chiropractors to be in violation of antitrust law.
She permanently barred the nation's largest organization of
physicians from boycotting chiropractors, who treat patients with
physical manipulation focused on the spine.
   ``The experience of the AMA in this case should now put other
medical associations, and hospitals dominated by them, on notice
that chiropractors will fight for the rights of their patients,''
said attorney George McAndrews, who represented the chiropractors.
   Those rights include fair treatment by hospitals, insurance
plans and other groups that have limited patients' access to
chiropractors, McAndrews said.
   The AMA has not decided whether to appeal the case further, said
association attorney Kirk Johnson.
   ``Although the AMA disagrees with the Court of Appeals decision,
the ruling should have no material impact on physicians or
patients,'' he said in a statement.
   After an eight-week trial, Ms. Getzendanner issued a permanent
injunction on Sept. 25, 1987, barring the AMA from ``restricting,
regulating or impeding'' its 275,000 members or the hospitals where
they work from associating with chiropractors.
   The judge said the AMA had proved it was motivated mostly by
sincere concern about whether chiropractic was scientifically
valid, though evidence indicated there was also selfish economic
reasons behind it.
   A three-judge appellate panel, which heard arguments in the case
in December, unanimously agreed, saying Ms. Getzendanner had
reached a ``reasonable'' decision in granting the injunction.
   At the time of her ruling, Ms. Getzendanner also directed the
AMA to publish a copy of her nine-page order in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, and to separately mail all of its
members and employees copies of the order.
   She also required that the AMA amend its Current Opinions of the
Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, the group's guidelines on
ethical behavior, to reflect that it is ethical for medical doctors
to associate with chiropractors.
   The AMA printed the ruling in the AMA journal but was granted a
delay on the other two requirements pending appeal.
   The lawsuit, filed in 1977 by four chiropractors in four
different states, sought no monetary damages but challenged the
refusal of medical doctors to acknowledge chiropractors'
professional abilities.
   There are about 45,000 chiropractors in the United States,
according to the American Chiropractic Association.
   Chiropractors are required to finish two years of college plus
four years of chiropractic college.
   The AMA has said previously that during the 1960s, it advised
physicians not to refer patients to chiropractors because the group
believed some of their treatments had no scientific basis.
   The policy was prompted by concern for patient safety, not by
doctors' fears of competition from chiropractors, the AMA said.
   Even so, the policy was abandoned in 1980, the AMA has
maintained.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany is only days away from
economic collapse, a West German official said today, but East
Germany denied the grim assessment.
   A West German government spokesman later also said East Germany
is not in danger of collapsing in the next few days, but that some
West German leaders believe that is the case.
   There was no clear reason for the conflicting assessments from
Bonn, where officials have different opinions about how to bail out
the neighboring country and the pace of reunifying the nations.
   Earlier today, a senior government official, speaking to
reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the East German
economy has moved to the point where ``insolvency could be within a
few days.''
   That would mean the Communist nation, where the government owns
virtually all components of the economy, would be unable to pay
workers or make payments on its foreign debt.
   The official in Bonn said Chancellor Helmut Kohl would address
the situation during his weekend visit to Moscow, where he will
meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Later, East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer denied
that his Communist-led nation is in such dire circumstances.
   Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein also issued a statement
saying that Bonn was not officially predicting an East German
collapse.
   ``The federal government is not of the opinion that East Germany
in the next days will be insolvent,'' Klein said, but he noted that
some individual leaders ``fear such extreme possibilities.''
   The plummeting economy has hastened _ and been worsened by _ the
mass immigration of East Germans to West Germany. The crisis
spurred mass unrest last year that toppled the hard-line Communist
regime.
   The interim Communist government says it will hold free
elections on March 18, when a new government is likely to take
control. But it appears likely that that government, instead of
being the answer to East Germany's future, will oversee the
transition to reunification of the Germanys.
   Kohl has been pressing for a combining of the two country's
currencies to give the East Germans a palpable reason to stay home.
   Bundesbank President Karl-Otto Poehl, the chief of West
Germany's central bank, told reporters in Bonn today that such a
monetary union _ most likely the circulation of West German
currency in the East _ will require major sacrifices by both
countries.
   But Poehl, who earlier had cautioned against giving East Germany
a quick monetary fix, appeared to soften his stand. He said West
Germany could afford merging currencies with East Germany and may
in fact have little choice.
   Some Europeans fear a united Germany could again become a
military threat.
   In a speech in the East German city of Potsdam outside Berlin,
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher sought to allay
European fears by saying that both nations should soon sign an
agreement not to build nuclear weapons or encroach on the borders
of neighboring countries.
   The superpowers worry that such a union could crumble their
military alliances. NATO has about 255,000 troops in West Germany,
most of them Americans. More than 380,000 Soviet soldiers are
stationed in East Germany, a key member of the Warsaw Pact.
   East Germany Premier Hans Modrow has proposed that a united
Germany be neutral, but Western nations have uniformly rejected
that stand.
   In Paris, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in an interview
published today that France does not oppose the reunification of
Germany but is against a neutral Germany, which he said would lead
to European instability.
   Officials in Bonn have proposed that what is now West Germany
could remain with NATO and the territory that was East Germany
could technically be nuetral.
   Kohl's talks with Gorbachev no doubt will deal with the
willingness of the Soviet Union to accept the loss of perhaps the
key component of its military strategy.

<TEXT>
   The federal Export-Import Bank is making a
$10.4 million grant to help China build a subway in Shanghai, the
bank announced Friday.
   The grant will be part of a $23.1 million financing package to
encourage the Chinese government to buy equipment from American
companies, against competition from similar subsidies offered by
France and West Germany.
   ``Had Eximbank not finalized its financing at this time, the
contracts won by American companies would have been jeopardized,''
the U.S. announcement said.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger earlier this week
went before committees of Congress to defend the Bush
administration on its China policy. Members from both parties have
accused President Bush of being too quick to lift sanctions against
the Chinese government after its bloody suppression of the movement
for democracy.
   The U.S. grant will come from a $109.5 million ``war chest,''
being used in China for the first time. Congress voted the money to
help U.S. businesses compete against similar government subsidies
from Japan, West Germany, France and other industrial countries.
   Jeni Falkiewicz, public affairs officer for the bank, said the
French and West German offers to China violated an international
agreement. The agreement was designed to limit the subsidies given
by governments of industrial countries to promote foreign sales.
   The rest of the U.S. financing package will consist of a
guarantee from the government bank of a $12.7 million loan to the
Private Export Funding Corp., which works closely with it. Because
of the guarantee, the corporation can offer easier terms to the
Chinese government than would otherwise be available in this
country.
   Ms. Falkiewicz said the bank is also working with the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to finance export deals
with money appropriated to help raise living standards in poor
countries. Competing governments also use aid funds in this way.
   The bank's announcement said major contracts for the Shanghai
subway were awarded to West German suppliers, after a financing
offer that included a grant of 73.2 percent while the U.S. grant
accounts for only 45 percent. The French won a contract for
tunneling equipment, while U.S. companies were chosen for
signaling, fire alarm detection and other systems.
   The biggest U.S. exporter is General Railway Signal, Inc. of
Rochester, N.Y.
   Officials, who spoke on condition that they not be named, said
criticism in Congress led to a U.S. request to the World Bank to
postpone until Feb. 27 its consideration of a $60 million loan to
help China's farmers.
   A Treasury Department spokesman, Robert Levine, said he could
neither confirm nor deny that the postponement was sought by the
United States. The World Bank is owned by 151 governments and is
the biggest source of aid to the Third World. This loan would be
part of a $780 million package that bank president Barber Conable
postponed in June, just after Chinese government tanks went into
Tiananmen Square. Bush later asked that these loans be held up.
   A $30 million World Bank loan to China announced on Thursday was
for relief of an earthquake that occurred in October and so was not
part of the package.

<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization plans a
new campaign to fight AIDS in East European countries, which only
recently began reporting cases of the deadly disease, officials
said Friday.
   Dr Jonathan Mann, head of the U.N. agency's AIDS program, said
East bloc countries form the ``new frontiers of the global
epidemic'' that has claimed hundreds of thousands of victims,
primarily in the Americas, Africa and West Europe.
   During a news conference, he urged the new governments that came
to power in the Eastern European pro-democracy movement to help the
campaign by looking at AIDS ``as a health rather than an
ideological issue.''
   He told a news conference that Romania was expected to be the
worst hit country in Eastern Europe because of the large number of
children infected by contaminated blood and needles.
   But he said WHO was also concerned about developments in other
countries, citing signs that drug users in Poland have become
infected with the HIV virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Dr. David Heymann, a WHO specialist who returned late Thursday
from a visit to Bucharest, said about one third of 1,500 Romanian
children screened for the disease were infected with the HIV virus.
   Mann said another WHO team will travel to Romania next week to
begin making plans for a program to fight the disease there. The
WHO campaign for all of Eastern Europe will officially be launched
at the end of February, he said.
   Heymann said that at the beginning of February, Romanian
authorities had reported 74 cases of AIDS, including 50 children.
Those figures are likely to increase once testing for the disease
is more widespread, the doctor said.
   Priorities of the WHO campaign include improving medical care in
East European countries, ensuring the use of sterile needles in
hospitals, counseling for victims and their families, and providing
better training of medical workers.
   WHO has already sent 100,000 screening kits to Romania as
initial assistance to help authorities determine the true extent of
AIDS in their country.
   Mann stressed the need for a nationwide education program to
publicize the risks of AIDS, which was long concealed by the regime
of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22.
   ``Romania shows the dangers of the silence on AIDS,'' he said.
   AIDS is often spread through sharing of needles or syringes by
drug abusers. Hard-line Communist leaders of the past viewed drug
abuse as a Western problem that did not affect them.
   A private organization, Doctors of the World, said this week
that Romania is in the grips of the first known epidemic of AIDS in
children because of the backward practices in its hospitals.
   Mann said that by the end of 1989, about 300 AIDS cases had been
reported from all Eastern European countries. Albania was the only
country in the region with no registered cases.
   Worldwide, more than 215,000 cases of AIDS had been reported to
WHO by the end of last month. However, many cases go unreported.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a variety of infections and cancers.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., one of the world's
largest advertising agencies, pleaded guilty today to making
$130,000 in illegal payments in its efforts to win the contract for
the Jamaican tourism account.
   The New York-based company was fined $500,000 for conspiring to
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payments to a
Jamaican businessman, Arnold Foote Jr., who in turn made payments
to Eric Anthony Abrahams, the former minister of tourism in
Jamaica, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy.
   The government alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam made the payments in
order to win and retain the lucrative Jamaican tourism account, for
which it produced the award-winning ``Come Back to Jamaica''
campaign in the early 1980s.
   The government, citing ``exculpatory evidence recently turned
over to the government,'' dropped charges against two Young &amp;
Rubicam executives, executive vice president Arthur R. Klein and
former account supervisor Thomas Spangenberg.
   A third Young &amp; Rubicam worker, Steven M. McKenna, faces federal
perjury charges.
   Foote and Abrahams have also been charged, but they remain in
Jamaica and have not appeared in the U.S. to face charges, Twardy
said.
   The settlement came the day after jury selection began in
federal court in the trial of the agency, which until today had
steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey denied motions to
dismiss racketeering charges against the executives, paving the way
for jury selection to begin.
   The case is believed to be the first attempt to use the
Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act against an
advertising agency.
   Young &amp; Rubicam had faced up to $7.5 million in fines.

<HEAD>After Years of Bannings, Activists Are Free At Last</HEAD>

   Since 1956, the government has
charged Helen Joseph with treason, detained her repeatedly, placed
her under house arrest and made it a crime to quote her.
   But the 84-year-old white anti-apartheid activist survived 34
years of bannings and on Feb. 2 became one of nearly 500 people,
living and dead, whose restrictions were lifted by President F.W.
de Klerk.
   ``I didn't think I'd see this day,'' Mrs. Joseph said, adding
that she was a bit disappointed the government no longer considered
her a threat. ``I'm a stubborn old bag and I wasn't expecting
things to change.''
   Police restrictions have been a way of life for many
anti-apartheid activists. Hundreds detained without charge during
the 3{-year-old state of emergency were released but then placed
under virtual house arrest.
   The restrictions varied, but often prohibited the activists from
leaving their neighborhoods, required them to be home each night,
prevented them from attending meetings or participating in
politics, and often made it impossible to hold a job.
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, son of recently released African National
Congress leader Walter Sisulu, was freed from prison in December
1988 after two years in detention. But he had to report daily to
police and was unable to resume his job as editor of the New Nation
newspaper until de Klerk rescinded his restriction order.
   Few have endured as much as Mrs. Joseph, a former social worker
and union official now confined to a wheelchair much of the time.
   The government charged Mrs. Joseph, ANC leader Nelson Mandela
and more than 150 others with treason in 1956 for their
anti-apartheid activities. All were acquitted in a trial that
lasted until 1961.
   However, Mrs. Joseph, a divorcee with no children, remained
under a banning order and in 1962 became the first South African
placed under house arrest. For the next nine years, police were the
only visitors allowed to enter her comfortable white house with a
red roof and a flower-filled garden in a Johannesburg suburb.
   Her house arrest ended in 1971 while she was undergoing a cancer
operation, but until Feb. 2 she remained a ``listed'' person,
meaning she could not be quoted in South Africa.
   She has been arrested numerous times, most recently in 1983 when
she sang a freedom song and gave a clenched-fist, black power
salute while attending a treason trial.
   As part of his reform program, de Klerk lifted the police orders
on 374 people who had been restricted after their release from
detention. He also removed the names of all 110 people who had been
``listed'' and could not be quoted. Many of the listed people are
either dead or have left South Africa. They include:
   _Most of the African National Congress leadership, such as
President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke in Sweden.
   _Donald Woods, whose book ``Cry Freedom,'' about the life and
death of black activist Steve Biko was made into a movie by the
same name three years ago. Woods now lives in London.
   _Numerous whites, including Anne Heymann, who died of pneumonia
Feb. 3 at the age of 66, and her husband, Isaac Heymann, who died
of cancer four days later at the age of 79.
   The Heymanns, both listed since the 1960s, lived only a few
blocks from Mrs. Joseph and often visited her at her front gate
during the years when she wasn't allowed guests inside her home.
   ``So many people suffered for so many years,'' Mrs. Joseph said.
``I'm not grateful (for the lifting of the restrictions). It was
not an act of compassion. It never should have been done in the
first place.''
   Despite failing health, she occasionally travels to
anti-government protests, such as an ANC rally last October in the
township of Soweto, where she received a rousing cheer from the
mostly black crowd of 70,000.
   Mrs. Joseph, whose requests to visit Mandela were repeatedly
denied, finally was granted permission and the two met last Dec. 21
for the first time in 28 years.
   ``He looked different after so many years, but then so did I,''
Mrs. Joseph said. ``He was in very good form, full of jokes, full
of laughter.''
   Four days later, Mrs. Joseph had Christmas dinner with Walter
Sisulu and dozens of other activists at the home of a friend.
   After her house arrest was lifted, she began a tradition of
making a toast at noon on Christmas to remember all the
anti-apartheid activists who were in exile, in prison or had died.
   Word of the tradition had spread to exiles and prisoners, and
Sisulu told Mrs. Joseph it was observed during his years in jail.
   She hopes one day all the activists will be able to hold a
Christmas toast together in South Africa, but she doubts she'll be
around to take part.
   ``I don't think I'll see the end of apartheid, but I'll see it
diminish,'' she said. ``You can't wash away 300 years of cruelty
and injustice overnight.''

<HEAD>Cold Pushes January Wholesale Prices Up Fastest in 15 Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 11th graf, The price, to make it snap beans and
dried beans nearly doubled, sted more than doubled</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Record price increases for vegetables and fuel
oil combined in January to produce the highest monthly wholesale
inflation rate in 15 years, a temporary spurt economists attributed
to the holiday cold snap.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index soared a seasonally
adjusted 1.8 percent last month, the sharpest rise since a 2
percent gain in November 1974, in the midst of the OPEC oil embargo.
   January energy prices rocketed 13.6 percent for the largest
monthly gain on record since the department began tracking the
sector in 1974. Food costs jumped 2.1 percent, the biggest increase
in six years.
   The month's overall price climb was triple the already brisk 0.6
percent gain in December and far above economists' average forecast
of about 1.2 percent.
   If wholesale inflation persisted at the January pace, it would
produce an annual price rise of 24.1 percent in 1990.
   However, economists expressed little worry and stock and bond
prices actually rose immediately after the report because the
``core rate'' of inflation _ prices of goods excluding food and
energy _ rose a slight 0.1 percent. The core rate is viewed as a
better measure of underlying inflationary pressure.
   Economists warn that the wholesale food and energy jolt is
filtering through to consumers and is likely to push up the
Consumer Price Index, the best-known inflation measure. But the
effect at both the retail and wholesale levels will be temporary,
they said.
   Analysts are predicting the wholesale inflation rate, which more
than doubled between 1988 and 1989 from 2.2 percent to 4.8 percent,
will retreat to about 4 percent this year.
   ``Without food and energy, commodity price inflation was very
low'' in January, said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.
``The report suggests much of the activity was weather-related and
will diminish in coming months.''
   As temperatures plummeted, fuel oil prices rose a startling 25.3
percent, the biggest jump on record. As refineries switched
production to fuel oil, supplies of gasoline grew short, sending
those prices up 16.7 percent. Natural gas costs rose a brisk 3.2
percent.
   The price of fresh and dried vegetable rose 58 percent for the
month, the largest seasonally adjusted gain recorded since the
department began tracking that category in 1967. Prices for
cabbage, lettuce and tomatoes more than doubled while snap beans
and dried beans nearly doubled, the department said.
   ``It was snowing in Brownsville, Texas, and Orlando, Fla., on
the same day. I doubt that ever happened before. That means we lost
both the Texas and Florida (vegetable) crops,'' said economist
Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   Egg, fruit and fish prices also rose, while rice, pasta, chicken
and turkey costs fell.
   In other categories, wholesale prices rose 2.9 percent for
children's clothing, 0.8 percent for men's and women's clothing,
and 0.9 percent for home electronic equipment.
   Ratajczak suggested the decline in the value of the dollar since
fall could be behind the increase in the cost of clothing, much of
which is imported.
   Balancing that were drops of 1.3 percent for tobacco, which had
risen 2.2 percent in December, and 0.7 percent for automobiles, the
result of a new round of discounting at auto dealerships.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index at 117.5 in
January. This meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods,
which cost $100 at the wholesale level in 1982, cost $117.50 last
month, up from $111.10 a year earlier.
   Soaring energy costs also drove up inflation in earlier stages
of the production process. The price of intermediate goods rose 1.2
percent overall, but only 0.1 percent excluding food and energy.
The price of crude goods was up 2.4 percent overall and 0.2 percent
minus food and energy.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

   Dr. Antonia C. Novello said Friday that she
would be a voice for those who can't communicate for themselves if
confirmed as Surgeon General.
   Novello also said she would speak out against tobacco companies
that target minorities.
   ``I have always felt that I am here to speak for people who have
never been able to communicate for themselves,'' Novello told the
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
   ``And, as a pediatrician, I have been the doctor of little
people who have no voice in society.''
   If confirmed, Novello would be the first woman, Hispanic and
Puerto Rican to serve in that position. The 45-year-old native of
Fajardo would succeed the outspoken C. Everett Koop, who served for
seven years.
   Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he supported
the confirmation, and was especially pleased at her answer when
asked whether she would speak out against tobacco companies that
target minorities as did Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan.
   ``Absolutely,'' she said. ``I feel as irate as Dr. Sullivan when
advertising is used to make a target for people who cannot take
care of themselves.''
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. recently withdrew plans to introduce a
cigarette aimed at blacks after being criticized by Sullivan and
others.
   Absent from the low-key hearing was any mention of abortion.
When Novello was selected in November, the White House said she
supported President Bush's stance.
   Bush opposes abortion except to protect the life of the mother
or in cases of rape and incest. He opposes extending federal
funding to abortions in cases of rape or incest.
   ``Smoking, HIV infection, substance abuse and the use of alcohol
are just some of the many areas of concern which demand our
attention,'' Novello said.
   Attending the hearing were Novello's husband, psychiatrist and
talk-show host Dr. Joseph Novello, and her first transplant
patient, 24-year-old Prosper Sanchez of Silver Spring, Md., who
received a kidney in 1977.

   West German authorities arrested
four people suspected of delivering to the Soviet KGB U.S.-made
computers that could have military use, the federal prosecutor's
office said Friday.
   The three men and the wife of one of them are suspected of
delivering high-tech Western products to the Soviets since
mid-1988, the office said in a statement.
   The four allegedly acquired a computer made by the U.S. company
Digital Equipment that can also be used for military purposes, and
delivered it to the KGB during a trip to East Germany, the
statement said.
   Three weeks later, they allegedly delivered an identical
computer through a third person.
   The group also allegedly tried to acquire a computer program
that could be used in space flights, the statement said.
   Two of the suspects are in investigative custody, while two have
been freed but remain under investigation.
   The statement did not identify the four. It said two of them
were salesmen.

   College officials who gathered at a
conference on black fraternity and sorority hazing said Friday
their goal was to end the practice, which one speaker called a form
of self-hatred.
   ``It is a realistic goal ... that speaks directly to the issue
of self determination,'' said Eric Abercrumbie, director of
minority programs and affairs at the University of Cincinnati.
   Speakers at the two-day conference at Hampton University defined
hazing as the physical, psychological or financial intimidation or
abuse of pledges to the social groups before they are initiated.
   ``I don't find it necessary to first dehumanize a person, then
turn around at a later time and call him brother,'' said Carroll
Hardy, dean of minority affairs at the College of William and Mary
in Williamsburg.
   Organizers of the event, which drew about 400 college officials
and students, said they hoped to find alternatives to hazing.
Students at the conference planned to discuss the issue Saturday.
   Manning Marable, a professor of political science and sociology
at the University of Colorado, told the group that blacks ``must
build strong organizations with a new vision of brotherhood and
sisterhood. ... Is hazing, is violence like this, the kind of
example we want to set?''
   Abercrumbie said hazing is a form of self-hate. His experience
was that groups that used hazing to strengthen their feeling of
cohesiveness generally pledged people who did not graduate and who
had problems with drug abuse.
   Penny Saffold, dean of students at San Francisco State
University, said fraternities and sororities are being asked to
change. ``Our community is in a state of crisis; we need crisis
measures. Somewhere along the line, many of our chapters have
forgotten the ideals that established their organization. We need
to talk about what the fraternities and sororities can do to help
the African-American community.''
   Last year, a Morehouse College student died in a hazing
incident. Raymond E. Crawford, the school's vice president of
student affairs, said pledging of fraternity and sorority members
has been suspended at the Georgia school until a commission can
decide whether there is a role at Morehouse for the groups.
   College administrators said the fraternities and sororities need
to replace hazing with community service and a dedication to
academic excellence.
   ``We need to ask what are the kinds of initiations, what are the
kinds of preparations for leadership that we need for our
community. We need leaders who are more passionate, more
courageous, more willing to take on the odds,'' said Vincent
Harding, professor of religion and social transformation at the
Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colo.

<HEAD>Baseball Owners Say Lockout Still On, But Talks Continuing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball owners today said they would
going ahead with plans for a spring-training lockout, but seemed to
soften their hard-line stance and said talks would continue.
   ``There is no change in our strategy,'' Milwaukee owner Bud
Selig said after owners met for two hours to discuss contract
negotiations. ``But there is going to be another meeting with the
players on Monday, and this is going to be a day-by-day
negotiation.''
   Camps are scheduled to open next Thursday. Clubs have been told
by the owners not to start spring training unless an agreement is
reached with players on a new contract.
   Today's meeting had been expected to produce a declaration that
a lockout by the owners was all but a sure thing.
   Selig, chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee, tried
to avoid the word ``lockout.'' When pressed, he said, ``nothing has
changed.''
   Chuck O'Connor, head of the PRC, said, ``the clubs are not free
to go to camp on Feb. 15. The status quo remained.''
   Commissioner Fay Vincent, who attended the meeting with owners,
said he hoped something could be accomplished in next week's
bargaining sessions.
   ``I'm eager to find a resolution to this problem. I am trying,
in a way I hope is relevant, to be useful.''
   Rick Dempsey, heading into a players meeting with union chief
Donald Fehr Thursday night, said he thought owners haven't ``come
to the table with their true offer yet. When they do, which will
probably take another week _ in 2{ weeks I think we'll be playing
again.''
   Opening day for the regular season is supposed to be April 2.
   Vincent has said he will not order camps opened, as former
commissioner Bowie Kuhn did in 1976.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary on Friday became the second
Soviet bloc nation to re-establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican
that were severed more than four decades ago.
   The agreement was signed in Parliament by Hungarian Premier
Miklos Nemeth and Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary
of state.
   Nemeth told a news conference that a nuncio would represent the
Vatican in Hungary and that Budapest will send an ambassador to the
Vatican.
   Restoration of relations ``will also contribute to the success
of Pope John Paul II's visit in 1991,'' said Nemeth.
   Cardinal Casaroli said that by restoring relations, ``both
parties wanted to show that this move is in their mutual interest.''
   Hungary follows Poland, which restored Vatican ties in July.
Other East bloc nations are likely to do the same following
revolutions that ousted hard-line Communist governments and cleared
the way for Western-style reforms.
   Casaroli, who arrived here Wednesday on a five-day visit, also
said the agreement signed Friday ``will not jeopardize the autonomy
of the churches, but rather will serve to protect and strengthen
their autonomy.''
   The restoration of diplomatic ties with the Vatican comes after
Hungary abolished restrictive laws on religion as part of the
country's move toward democracy.
   Relations between Hungary and the Vatican were broken after the
government expelled the Vatican's envoy in 1945.
   The Hungarian Roman Catholic church gave in to pressure from the
Stalinist leadership Aug. 30, 1950, agreeing to surrender its
autonomy.
   Nemeth recalled that in 1964 the two sides signed a partial
agreement ``which reflected our differences but also contained
agreements which made further cooperation possible.''
   ``Despite the differences, the dialogue between the Vatican and
Hungary always had its sincere adherents,'' Nemeth said.
   Negotiations between Hungary, which has a Roman Catholic
majority, and the Vatican had been going on for months.
   Casaroli jointly celebrated Mass on Thursday with Hungarian
Cardinal Laszlo Paskai in the Basilica at Esztergom, the seat of
Hungary's Roman Catholic Primate.
   At a ceremony following the Mass, interim President Matyas
Szueroes denounced the trial of Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty under
Stalinist rule as a ``show trial,'' marking the late primate's de
facto rehabilitation.
   In reply to a question Friday about confiscated church assets,
Nemeth said: ``I myself raised the matter in our talks. The
government is seeking ways of returning the illegally seized church
assets. This will be done gradually and in ongoing consultations
with the churches.''
   Parliament enacted a law Jan. 24 that separates church and
state, ending state interference in church affairs and granting all
denominations full autonomy.
   Commenting on the pontiff's visit to Czechoslovakia in April
this year, Casaroli said it would be a brief one, while the
Hungarian trip would be a full Apostolic visit.
   ``Czechoslovakia was more isolated from the Holy See, and
therefore it was deemed desirable to make an early brief visit,''
he said.

<HEAD>Iranian Spiritual Leader Says Rushdie Must Be Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie must be killed, as the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered, for blaspheming Islam and
the prophet Mohammed in his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Iran's
new spiritual leader said Friday.
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the
announcement by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was ``much to be
regretted.'' A friend of the British novelist called it a rejection
of Rushdie's recent peace overtures to Moslems.
   There was no immediate comment from Rushdie, who has been in
hiding since Khomeini declared the novel blasphemous and decreed on
Feb. 14, 1989, that faithful Moslems should kill its author.
Several Iranian leaders put a pricce on the writer's head of $5.2
million.
   Khomeini died in June, but the death sentence was not lifted. On
Friday, his successor as spiritual leader of Iran's Shiite Moslems
said the religious decree ``about the writer of the blasphemous
book `The Satanic Verses' is still valid and must be implemented.''
   Tehran radio said he made the statement in a sermon at weekly
prayers on the Moslem sabbath.
   Rushdie, who was born in India to Moslem parents, said this week
he had considered appearing in public to deliver a lecture on
censorship, but his police guards dissuaded him.
   In a 7,000-word essay published in the British newspaper
Independent on Sunday, and in an interview earlier this week with
Newsweek magazine, Rushdie expressed regret for the pain the book
had caused but said he stood by it.
   He said he was pressing for a paperback edition and declared
that charges of reneging on his faith were invalid because he had
not been a practicing Moslem for years.
   Independent on Sunday's literary editor, Blake Morrison,
described the Iranian position as a disappointing rebuff and told
BBC radio: ``It was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory
tone adopted here would filter through to Tehran.''
   Bob Gregory of Viking Penguin, which published ``The Satanic
Verses,'' said that when Khomeini originally announced the death
sentence, ``We condemned it in the strongest language we could
think of, and we do precisely the same again.''
   Iran's main opposition group condemned the reaffirmed threat to
Rushdie. In a statement telexed to The Associated Press from its
headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, the Mujahedeen Khalq accused
Khamenei of trying to divert attention from internal conflicts in
Iran.
   Dr. Kalim Siddiqi, director of the Moslem Institute in Britain,
said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. television:
``There is a sentence of death which will be executed ... by the
political and judicial authorities of Islam, not by private
citizens living in Britain or anywhere else.''
   Siddiqi said he met with Khamenei in Tehran this week and was
told Iran would not compromise on the death decree.
   Asked whether he approved of such threats, Siddiqi said: ``I
approve of it entirely. It is not a death threat. It is a death
sentence passed by the highest judicial authority in the world of
Islam, and it is according to Islamic law.''
   Britain and a dozen Western allies recalled their ambassadors
from Tehran last year in protest. All but Britain have resumed
relations.
   On Friday, the Foreign Office said Britain sought normal
relations on condition Iran renounced threats and violence, helped
obtain the release of British hostages held in Lebanon and freed
Roger Cooper, a British businessman imprisoned in Tehran.
   Nine Iranians deported from Britain arrived in Tehran on Friday.
They included an Iranian television journalist, an Iran Air
official and seven students.
   The London bureau chief of Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting, identified by Tehran radio only as Keivanara, said:
``The expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the
anniversary of the death order against Salman Rushdie.''
   Britain ordered Feb. 1 that the nine leave within a week for
reasons of national security. It did not elaborate, but similar
previous expulsions were linked to the Rushdie decree.

   The Bush administration has completed a
drug-summit agreement with three South American countries
committing the United States to broad economic and military
assistance to counteract the Latin nations' economic reliance on
drugs, an official said Friday.
   In addition to the $423 million anti-drug package President Bush
is proposing for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, the administration
will pledge to help track illegal export of U.S.-produced firearms
used by drug dealers and crack down on drug-related chemical
exports, officials said.
   The four-nation pact also calls for Bush to press other Western
nations to provide economic aid to the three Andean countries, said
a South American diplomat familiar with the document.
   The presidents of the four countries are expected to sign the
agreement when they meet at the Feb. 15 drug summit in Cartagena,
Colombia.
   ``We've got agreement'' on the final wording, said Michael Skol,
deputy assistant secretary of state for South American affairs.
   He described the agreement as ``a very comprehensive document of
cooperation on the drug issue,'' significant for its recognition of
rights and responsibilities of producer and consumer countries
``without finger-pointing.''
   The U.S. portion of the document closely tracks Bush's national
drug strategy plan, Skol said. The agreement deals with the general
categories of interdiction and military cooperation, economic
alternatives to the drug trade and efforts to get other countries'
aid in the anti-drug effort.
   ``There's a promise of asking for increased spending'' by
Congress, but no dollar amounts in the document, he said.
   For the second year of his national anti-drug strategy, Bush
last month proposed $423 million for fiscal 1991 in total
drug-related spending for the Andean countries _ in military, law
enforcement and economic assistance.
   Some $206 million of that is an increase in spending as part of
a five-year $2.2 billion plan.
   Skol said the communique will discuss money laundering, arms
exports, and extradition as well as military assistance and
economic aid _ including such matters as balance of payment
assistance and substitute crops to make up for destruction of
lucrative fields of coca, which is used to make cocaine.
   He described the weapons export provisions only by saying that
they discuss cooperation among countries on the process to ``make
it work better.''
   A spokesman for the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said
that refers to a new U.S. policy that will station two ATF agents
in Colombia to help local law enforcement officials trace the
origins of recovered weapons.
   The policy is aimed at addressing the Latin nations' complaints
about U.S.-exported arms _ which can be legally exported with a
State Department permit and end-user certificate _ falling into the
hands of drug lords, said spokesman Tom Hill.
   The Bush administration has linked aid to the drug-production
countries to their cooperation in the anti-drug efforts.
   The drug-summit communique does not spell out details of U.S.
military assistance to the Andean countries, but the Latins have
insisted it be restricted to equipment and training rather than
direct U.S. military involvement in interdiction, said the South
American diplomat.
   There are no plans to use the military except in a training
capacity, said Skol. A new Washington Post-ABC poll shows a
majority of Americans _ 55 percent _ favored sending U.S. troops to
help the Colombian military, and 45 percent were opposed. Only 19
percent of Colombians favored such a course and 77 percent were
opposed.
   Fifty-eight percent of Colombians but only 25 percent of
Americans said the Colombian government is winning its war against
the drug cartels.
   Those familiar with the summit agreement said it commits the
United States to:
   _Tighter enforcement on export of precursor drugs, such as
ether, that are used in the production of cocaine.
   _Money for crops to substitute for coca.
   _Promotion of private initiatives for trade opportunities and
technical assistance to help expand Andean markets.
   _Pressure on other nations to help the drug-production nations
with economic and trade assistance. One diplomat said that is
expected to be a topic at the economic summit later this year in
Houston.
   The summit also may produce agreement between Bolivia and the
United States to renew an extradition treaty that has not been
updated since 1900, said one diplomatic source.
   The White House has praised Bolivia for extradition action,
particularly the December extradition of alleged drug trafficker
Luis Arce Gomez, but the Bolivian law was written before drug
crimes were considered and thus does not address them specifically.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco is eager to talk to Bush
about the need to reinstate a coffee export quota system that was
beneficial to farmers in his country. It was unclear whether coffee
will specifically be addressed in the summit communique.
   In addition, Peru's president, Alan Garcia, is expected to push
for larger commitments of U.S. spending on anti-drug efforts. On
another issue, Garcia may want to personally convey to Bush his
heated opposition to the December U.S. invasion of Panama.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday awarded the Flo Hyman
Award for excellence in sports to former tennis pro Chris Evert,
calling her ``the role model for our nation's young women.''
   Bush presented the award at the White House on behalf of the
Women and Girls in Sports Foundation, following activities for
National Girls and Women in Sports Day on Thursday.
   The award is given in memory of the Olympic volleyball star who
died suddenly in 1986.
   In presenting Evert the glass trophy, Bush said the winner of 18
Grand Slam tournaments had ``represented not just the game of
tennis, but your country. And you've done it so very well and with
grace, dignity and good sportsmanship.''
   ``I know that all of your friends and colleagues here will agree
that you certainly are the role model for our nation's young women,
and we all miss you on the professional tennis circuit,'' Bush said.
   The president quipped, however, that tennis pros Pam Shriver and
Martina Navratilova, who waged tough matches against Evert, ``won't
miss you on the tennis circuit.''
   Evert said she wanted to stress the importance of physical
education in schools and sought the president's help in pushing
that point as part of his education package.
   Bush told the small gathering of female athletes that his wife
Barbara ``is this very moment out swimming her mile.''
   Mrs. Bush swims at least a mile each day in the outdoor White
House pool.

<DATELINE>FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American wildlife biologist embarks
Saturday for the frozen wilderness of Siberia, where he will begin
a Soviet-American research project to help save the endangered
Siberian tiger, the largest cat in the world.
   Thousands of Siberian tigers used to roam Asia in an area
roughly the size of Europe. Today, fewer than 500 are fighting for
survival in a region smaller than Pennsylvania, according to Howard
B. Quigley, assistant biology professor at Frostburg State
University in western Maryland.
   ``Based on the way the population has gone down in the past 100
years, if we don't take some dramatic steps, we could lose this
species in this century,'' he said. ``If we don't do something, the
only place you might see tigers in the year 2000 is in zoos.''
   The remaining Siberian tigers live near the Soviet-Chinese
border on the east coast of the Soviet Union. But their habitat is
being eroded by Chinese and Soviets who are clearing forests for
timber, and to make room for farms and urban development.
   ``The loss of habitat is the most important, but a close second
is that people are hunting wildlife _ the same prey as the
tigers,'' Quigley said. ``If you take away all their prey, there is
nothing for them to eat.
   ``If we can get cooperation from both (countries) to develop a
comprehensive conservation plan, the tiger will be the winner.''
   The Siberian tiger, which can measure up to 12 feet from nose to
tail, has brownish-yellow and burnt orange fur with black, vertical
stripes. White and ivory-colored fur accents its throat, belly and
inside legs.
   A full-grown Siberian Tiger weighs between 450 and 800 pounds.
It is the biggest of cats _ bigger than the African lion, often
called ``the king of beasts,'' and bigger than the Bengal tiger,
the one most commonly seen in zoos and circuses. African lions
weigh up to 500 pounds; Bengal tigers average about 400 pounds.
   Humans admire the animal for its strength, grace and
independence, but they also fear the tiger, which has on some
occasions attacked people. ``Generally, they're more afraid than we
are,'' Quigley said.
   During the past two decades, three of the eight subspecies of
tigers have become extinct, he said. There are no more Caspian
tigers roaming central Asia and the Javan and Bali tigers in
Indonesia have died out.
   The populations of Bengal, Sumatran and Indochinese tigers are
stable. But there are only 20 to 30 Chinese tigers left in
south-central China.
   ``There are some Chinese scientists looking into the
situation,'' Quigley said. ``There isn't enough habitat and I'm
told it's hopeless.''
   Quigley, 37, is traveling to the Soviet Union with Maurice
Hornocker, director of the University of Idaho's Wildlife Research
Institute in Moscow, Idaho. The wildlife institute and Frostburg
State are helping sponsor the project, which will cost an estimated
$75,000.
   They will fly to Vladivostok, a port city of 550,000 just north
of North Korea, and journey into the wilderness with three Soviet
scientists to survey the tigers' habitat. They plan to begin their
field work 11 months from now.
   The researchers plan to trap the animals and put fist-sized
transmitters attached to collars around their necks. Using radio
signals, they will be able to track the tigers.
   The researchers want to know what the tigers eat and how far
they roam. They want to find out how often they reproduce in the
wild and the size of their litters.
   ``The Soviet researchers have learned about all they can using
the technology they have available to them,'' Quigley said. ``It's
time to use modern technology to expand on our knowledge of the
animal's ecology.''
   ``The Siberian tiger is one of the most impressive predators to
ever walk the face of the earth,'' Quigley added. ``If we as humans
_ the dominant species in the world _ can't protect their existence
by setting aside a tiny island where they can live, how dignified
can we say we are?''

   College studies that stress classic
Western art and literature over works of blacks, women or other
groups are a form of white supremacy, says Amiri Baraka.
   Baraka, the poet and playwright also known as Leroi Jones, told
a University of Virginia audience Thursday the cultural revolution
that accompanied the civil rights movement subsided in the last
decade and was replaced by attitudes similar to those of the 1950s.
   Baraka challenged the more than 200 people in the audience to
take an active role in turning the tables.
   In his keynote address for the university's black history month,
Baraka urged students and professors to fight literary canons that
elevate classic European art and literature above all other forms.
   Art and literature should not be segregated but should instead
reflect the variety of people in the world, he said.
   In the 1960s, ``we wanted a poetry that would come out of the
library and into the streets where the people were,'' said Baraka.
   In the 1950s, poetry was an emotionless craft that mirrored the
traditional values of the era, he said, while the catch-word of the
following decade was revolution.
   ``We were challenging the whiteness in works of art,'' Baraka
said.
   Baraka's writings include 24 plays, seven works of non-fiction
and 11 books of poetry.

   Former baseball commissioner
Bowie Kuhn bought a $1 million home in an exclusive subdivision
here, newspapers reported Friday.
   St. Johns County court records show that Kuhn bought a home in
Marsh Landing from Jacksonville developer Chester Stokes, The
Florida Times-Union said.
   Kuhn, baseball commissioner from 1969 to 1984, was a partner in
the New York firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn, which filed for bankruptcy in
December.
   Marine Midland Bank and former law partners are looking for Kuhn
to serve him legal papers relating to the bankruptcy.
   In court papers filed Tuesday, Marine Midland charged that in
the last two weeks, Kuhn, seeking to place his property out of the
bank's reach, sold his Ridgewood, N.J., home and brought the home
in Florida. His firm reportedly owes the bank $3.1 million, along
with other debts.
   Florida law does not allow creditors to seize residences in the
state in bankruptcy proceedings.
   For two weeks, deputies from the St. Johns County Sheriff's
Office have tried to serve court paper on Kuhn, without success,
The New York Times reported Friday.
   Kuhn and Harvey D. Myerson, a New York corporate lawyer, formed
the firm with great fanfare in 1988. After a dispute with Shearson
Lehman Hutton and internal disagreements among the partners, the
firm collapsed.
   ``I have been unable to get in touch with him since December,''
Myerson said Thursday.
   Marine Midland's laywer, William J. Brown, has asked the U.S.
District Court in New York to attach Kuhn's stock holdings there,
as well as his summer home in Quoque, N.Y., to prevent him from
making any additional transfers of assets.
   Officials from Shearson, to which Myerson &amp; Kuhn owes $488,000,
also have been unable to find him.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William J. Bennett on
Friday accused District of Columbia officials of lackluster efforts
in the war on drugs and a Bennett aide said the city let $2.4
million in federal funds slip away.
   ``I don't know why it's heresy when I say it,'' Bennett told the
Senate Budget Committee. ``Everybody in this town knows that this
government is not fulfilling its responsibilities to its citizens.''
   The testimony came at a hearing in which Democrats on the Senate
Budget Committee queried Bennett about efforts to combat drugs in
the District of Columbia.
   Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., sought to spotlight the rampant
problem in this city, whose mayor, Marion Barry, is in a Florida
alcohol and drug clinic after his arrest on a cocaine possession
charge. An aide has said Barry is being treated primarily for
alcoholism.
   Sasser reminded Bennett that when he became drug policy director
a year ago he promised to make Washington a test case in the fight
against drugs that still can be bought on streetcorners ``only
blocks from this Capitol.''
   Bennett said action by federal officials ``cannot take the place
of local government, federal initiatives cannot replace local
initiatives.''
   ``We're tired of being flogged for a problem that is not of our
making,'' Bennett told the committee.
   District police estimate that more than 60 percent of the record
438 murders recorded in the nation's capital last year were
drug-related.
   Sasser said District of Columbia officials have complained that
they have not gotten the assistance from the federal government
promised in the early days of the drug war.
   Bruce L. Carnes, director of planning, budget and administration
under Bennett, told the panel that the federal government has made
a commitment to provide more than $90 million of the $102 million
that the District sought.
   He said, however, that despite repeated warnings District
officials allowed $2.4 million in Defense Department funds for
bolstering the National Guard as a drug-fighting tool to slip away
through inaction.
   ``Almost every penny of that lapsed because the District did not
draw down that money,'' Carnes told lawmakers. ``I kept telling
them, the clock is ticking. ... You've got to draw down that money
or it's going to lapse. It lapsed.''
   He was asked by a reporter after the hearing if he had delivered
his warning personally to the mayor and said he had not. He was
then asked if he had warned City Administrator Carol B. Thompson,
who is operating a caretaker government while the mayor is in
treatment.
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' Carnes said. ``I said it to
various District officials.''
   Lurma Rackley, a Barry spokeswoman, said the mayor ``chose to
have no comment on Mr. Bennett when he was here. I'm sure that he
would rather have Mr. Tucker or Ms. Thompson, who are the
administration's spokespersons on drugs, handle this.''
   Sterling Tucker, the city's anti-drug policy coordinator, was
out of town and unavailable for comment Friday, a Tucker aide said.
   Thompson did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli peace activist walked out of
prison unrepentant Friday and vowed to meet again with PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat, the crime that put him behind bars for 122 days.
   ``I will meet Arafat another dozen times,'' Abie Nathan told a
handful of supporters who gathered outside the prison gates in the
pouring rain. ``I don't mind spending the rest of my life in prison.
   ``I will meet with Palestinians and with any Arab leader who
stretches his hand to talk of peace,'' he said. ``This is my way of
fighting.''
   Also Friday, Israeli soldiers killed an Arab youth in the
occupied West Bank town of Qabatiya, and Palestinians observed a
general strike to mark the beginning of the 27th month of the
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands, army and
hospital reports said.
   The army said soldiers shot Abed el-Kader Iknin, 19, after he
tried to stab them. His death raised to 655 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians since the
uprising began in December 1987. At least 181 Palestinians have
been killed by their fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of cooperating
with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died.
   A group of leading left-wing authors and poets published an ad
in the independent Haaretz newspaper Friday demanding the repeal of
the amendment to Israel's anti-terrorism law that makes meeting
with PLO officials a crime punishable by up to three years in jail.
   Nathan, 63, was sentenced under that law to six months in prison
after pleading guilty to meeting Arafat and other Palestine
Liberation Organization officials in Tunis in 1988. He entered Eyal
prison Oct. 10, and the penalty was reduced by two months for good
behavior.
   As Nathan left prison he shook hands with the warden and said
``lehitraot,'' Hebrew for ```til we meet again.''
   A group of teen-agers from a kibbutz, or collective farm, then
presented him with a white dove, which he symbolically released.
   Peace activists also handed Nathan a bouquet of flowers and an
olive branch.
   ``I was put in prison because of a law which is an undemocratic
law which would not be accepted anywhere in the world,'' Nathan
told The Associated Press. ``I will do everything in my power in
order to continue my struggle to change the law.''
   Nathan's first of seven meetings with Arafat was in 1982, when
he went to Lebanon during the Israeli siege of Beirut in an
unsuccessful attempt to gain freedom for a captured Israeli soldier.
   He is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private plane
to Cairo in 1966 to try to persuade Egypt to make peace with
Israel. In 1978, he went on a 45-day hunger strike to protest the
building of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

   Snipers killed three civilians fleeing an
embattled district of east Beirut on Friday as rival Christian
forces battled with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
   Police said the three, a married couple and a friend, were
killed as they tried to escape the low-income neighborhood of Ein
Rummaneh about noon.
   Earlier in the day, police said rescuers took 42 bullet-riddled
corpses from east Beirut districts that were the scenes of most of
the savage fighting.
   The command of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun also reported the
deaths of 10 soldiers and two officers in the last two days of
hostilities.
   That brought the overall casualties to 430 killed and 1,680
wounded in the worst intra-Christian conflict of the 15-year civil
war, pitting Aoun's soldiers against Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militiamen.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the factions blamed each other for provoking the
intermittent skirmishes across confrontation lines dividing the
Christian enclave in east Beirut.
   The shooting forced Maronite Catholic churches to cancel
services on the occasion of St. Maroun's day, the patron saint of
the sect.
   Mass was celebrated instead in the studios of the Voice of
Lebanon radio station in east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh neighborhood. It
was said by Archbishop Khalil Abi Nader, an aide to Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, and was broadcast live.
   The French Embassy, based in east Beirut, issued a statement
saying France's minister for humanitarian affairs, Bernard
Kouchner, would try ``to pursue efforts aimed at stabilizing a
cease-fire in Lebanon.''
   A French source, who refused to be further identified, said
Kouchner, who had sponsored the evacuation of 16 wounded victims
from east Beirut for treatment in France, was ``not optimistic
about the future of the cease-fire.''
   The police spokesman also said the combatants ``do not seem to
be preparing to withdraw.''
   ``The tanks are still in combat formation. Fighters are still in
firing positions. These are not indications that a truce is in the
making,'' he said.
   Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente, who had launched repeated efforts to
halt the bloodshed, left Beirut to undergo an operation that he had
postponed for a long time, a statement said. It did not elaborate.
   A security committee grouping representatives of Geagea and Aoun
held a two-hour meeting in Bkirki north of Beirut.
   A statement afterward said both sides assured Puente, who
attended the meeting, that they would strictly adhere to a
cease-fire. They also agreed on reopening the Christian enclave's
three main highways.
   More than a half-dozen previous cease-fires have collapsed.
   ``This is your last chance. His holiness Pope John Paul II
insists there will not be a second chance. You have to resolve your
difference on a basis of coordination in military affairs and
plurality in political affairs,'' the statement quoted Puente as
telling committee members.
   The clashes in the Christian enclave have forced hundreds of
civilians to flee to safety in Moslem west Beirut and other areas
outside the enclave.
   The fighting between rival Christian forces for control of the
Christian heartland is the latest in the 15-year cycle of sectarian
bloodshed.
   Aoun has refused to recognize a Syrian-backed Christian-Moslem
government and has battled to drive out Syrian troops siding with
Moslem militias in west Beirut.
   Rival Shiite Moslem factions also have battled intermittently
for control of Beirut's southern slums.

   Cuba accused the United States on Friday
of playing modern-day buccaneer by attacking a Cuban-chartered

properly.
   Ambassador Alexander Watson told the Security Council the U.S.
actions were ``fully consistent with international maritime law and
practice. The action taken by the Cuban government was not.''
   The freighter Hermann, registered in Panama, was hit at least
twice by fire from a U.S. Coast Guard cutter Jan. 31 when the crew
refused to allow a search and U.S. authorities suspected the vessel
was involved in drug smuggling. The freighter then sailed into
Mexican waters, and the U.S. cutter Chincoteague ended its pursuit.
   Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada of Cuba accused the United
States of endangering security in the region and violating
international law by interfering with the freighter in
international waters.
   He said Cuba ``is not ready to grant the United States the right
of practicing piracy, nor will Cubans allow themselves to be
intimidated by imperial arrogance.''
   ``What difference is there between this repressive action and
actions undertaken by buccaneers of the old pirate days?'' Alarcon
asked.
   He said the Hermann had no connection with drug trafficking and
urged the 15-member Security Council to put an end to U.S. actions
he described as threatening international peace and security.
   Cuba requested the meeting of the council, which adjourned
without action. Cuba is council president for February and passed
the gavel temporarily to South Yemen.
   Watson, the deputy U.S. permanent representative, said the
United States had obtained permission from Panama to search the
Hermann if necessary.
   He said Cuba ``inexplicably ordered the civilian crew of the
Hermann to resist the lawful efforts of the Coast Guard to inspect
the vessel as part of a routine law enforcement operation.''
   That showed ``blatant disregard'' for international efforts to
stop the illegal drug trade, the ambassador said.
   Since Cuba had allowed previous searches in similar
circumstances, Watson said, the incident proved President Fidel
Castro's government wanted to provoke a confrontation.
   ``The incident is not a spat between the U.S. and Cuba, although
the Cuban government, for reasons that are opaque, tries to make it
one,'' he said. ``The only states involved are the United States
and Panama. ... The government of Cuba acted as if it had the right
to frustrate a lawful inspection duly authorized by the flag state.
That is a prescription for chaos at sea.''
   Watson said the Hermann's captain refused to identify the crew
by nationality and caused suspicion because his answers to
authorities on the cutter were unusually brief and evasive. He said
previous searches of vessels on the same route had yielded illegal
narcotics.
   Although the Hermann crew told the Coast Guard the vessel had no
cargo aboard, the freighter was low in the water, creating further
suspicions of illegal activity, the U.S. ambassador told the
council.
   He said the cutter tried to disable the Hermann by firing shots
into its stern when other attempts to stop it failed.
   Before firing at the freighter, Watson said, the cutter's crew
displayed blue law enforcement lights, sprayed water across the
Hermann's decks and down its stack, and fired warning shots across
its bow.

   A blind man was left stranded and screaming
for help after his wife was killed by a hit-and-run motorist,
police said.
   Police said Charles Walker told them he and 55-year-old his wife
were walking Thursday when he heard a ``swishing'' noise and he
could no longer find or hear his wife.
   A resident heard Walker's screams and called officers.
   Police, Young County deputies and Texas Department of Public
Safety officers found Mildred Walker's body in a field about 50
feet from where she had been struck.
   Police said Charles Ike Herpeche, 34, of Graham, was arrested on
a charge of failure to stop and render aid after officers tracked
down the automobile by checking chrome fragments left at the scene.
   Herpeche was being held Friday in the Young County Jail in lieu
of $50,000 bail.

<HEAD>Administration Asks End of Duties on Some Caribbean, Central
American Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration asked Congress on
Friday to remove import duties on clothing, shoes and other
labor-intensive products from the Caribbean and Central America but
said it opposes any tampering with sugar quotas imposed on the
region.
   Endorsing an extension and expansion of President Reagan's 1983
Caribbean Basin Initiative, U.S. Trade Represenative Carla Hills
said lifting the present duties would ``mitigate the need for
(foreign) aid and raise our own exports'' to the region.
   However, she said changing import quota formulas on sugar to
assure the Caribbean a stable U.S. market to the possible detriment
of other exporters, such as Australia and the Phillippines, would
violate international trade agreements.
   When asked at a Senate hearing if she would recommend that
President Bush veto a bill that includes a guaranteed minimum for
sugar imports from the Caribbean, Mrs. Hills said she didn't know.
   Congress is expected this year to make permanent the current
program, now scheduled to expire in September 1995. But expanding
it to include duty-free status on a wide variety of goods that
compete with U.S. products is encountering widespread opposition.
   ``Supporters should keep in mind the adverse consequences,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee's subcommittee on international trade.
   Lawmakers, Baucus said at Friday's hearing by his panel, ``have
close ties with the Caribbean, but they have even closer ties with
their own constituents.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., for example, strongly oppose removing the present
duties on shoes and leather products. Their states are major
producers of both.
   The House last year approved a bill by Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,
to make the initiative permanent but struck provisions that would
have extended the duty-free status for several products.
   However, the bill would cut duties in half for a wide variety of
products, including non-leather footwear, handbags, luggage and
work gloves.
   It and a companion bill by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., would
increase the duty-free allowance for tourists returning from the
Caribbean from $400 to $600.
   Congressional sources said the Senate version could be ready for
a floor vote by late March.

<TEXT>
   An assembly of 72 members who were on
opposite sides of a 23-year war unanimously adopted a democratic
constitution Friday in the last major step to independence from
South Africa.
   It guarantees fundamental individual rights and limits a
president to two five-year terms, a rarity on a continent where
leaders often serve for life. The constitution will take effect
with independence March 21.
   A spirit of compromise and reconciliation was evident during the
80-day drafting process, although the members' constituents ranged
from black Marxists to right-wing whites.
   ``This is indeed a historic day,'' said Hage Geingob, chairman
of the Constituent Assembly and an official of the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   SWAPO guerrillas ended a 23-year bush war against South African
rule last year, and in November the movement won 41 of the assembly
seats to assure itself control of the new government.
   Delegates adopted the constitution in a ceremony on the front
steps of the Tintenpalast, the legislative building on a hilltop in
Windhoek, capital of the vast, sparsely populated territory South
Africa captured from Germany in World War I.
   Former guerrillas and the territorial police, once enemies,
stood beside one another to watch the events.
   ``Today, the masses of our people have a constitution which
embodies their aspirations to be masters of their own destiny,''
said Sam Nujoma, leader of SWAPO. The assembly is expected to elect
him as Namibia's first president on March 20, the day before
independence.
   Nujoma praised the assembly delegates for ``confounding all the
doubters'' with their speedy and harmonious work.
   Moses Katjuiuonga, leader of a small black party, said the
drafting process should provide inspiration to South Africa, where
the white government is edging toward negotiations with the black
majority.
   Namibia's new flag was displayed at Friday's ceremony and a
13x20-foot copy of the constitution's preamble served as a
backdrop. Those attending included Louis Pienaar, the South African
administrator of the territory, and Martti Ahtisaari, head of the
U.N. group monitoring the independence process.
   South Africa agreed to grant independence under a regional peace
treaty also signed by Angola and Cuba, which also called for
withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers in Angola. More than 6,000
U.N. civilian and military personnel have been in Namibia since
April 1989.
   Despite a hard-fought election campaign and sharp ideological
differences, the seven parties represented in the assembly quickly
reached agreement on the constitution after beginning work in
November.
   In addition to a declaration of fundamental rights, the charter
provides for freedom of movement and speech, and a free press. It
outlaws capital punishment and detention without trial, and
envisions multiparty democracy, regular elections, an independent
judiciary and an executive president.
   Janie de Wet, leader of the largest white party, said at the
ceremony that most of his constituents planned to stay in Namibia
and contribute to its development.
   Nujoma has chosen a white businessman, Gert Hanekom, as
agriculture minister and selected other whites and opposition party
members for important posts in an effort to unite Namibians and
ease the fears of the 75,000 whites, who control most of the
economy.
   Independence celebrations next month are expected to attract
more than 20 heads of state and thousands of foreign guests to
Windhoek, which has only a few hotels.
   With about 120,000 inhabitants, it is by far the largest city in
this mineral-rich territory, whose total population is only 1.3
million.
   In another development, Namibia's administrator Louis Pienaar
announced amnesty for members of the South Africa-led security
forces convicted of crimes ``in the performance of their duties.''
   It was not immediately known how many would qualify for amnesty.
   Pienaar also said the South African government would release
five prisoners serving sentences in Walvis Bay, a South African
enclave on Namibia's western coast. The five were convicted of
public violence.
   Pienaar said the releases were taken in the spirit of
reconciliation as shown in the unanimous adoption of the
constitution.

<HEAD>Bush Promises States `New Approaches,' not `Quick Fixes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told state lawmakers Friday not
to expect quick fixes from Washington, but promised federal help to
promote ``new approaches to solving old problems.''
   Speaking to a group of state legislators at the White House, the
president promised to help cut burdensome red tape that restricts
the flow of federal funds to the states.
   ``My formula for federalism comes down to ... more flexibility
and fewer mandates,'' Bush said.
   His remarks came a day after a report by the National Conference
of State Legislatures said that half of the states are facing
deficits or unexpectedly low revenues.
   Bush said his fiscal 1991 budget proposal calls for increased
spending on the environment and education and for combatting drugs
and crime.
   That might help financially strapped states deal with these
problems, Bush suggested. ``More federal money should not, in my
view, automatically mean more federal management,'' he said.
   But, he added, ``We don't need a quick fix, we need quick
action.''
   Using the ``states as laboratories'' theme he has sounded
before, Bush said he was prepared to support more ``demonstration
projects, both fostering and financing experimentation in the
states.''
   ``From criminal justice to education, from child care to the
environment, state and local governments are looking for new
approaches to solving old problems,'' he said.
   The president also voiced a ``broad, philosophical commitment to
federalism.''
   Federalism is the word the Reagan administration used for a
variety of proposals to transfer programs _ and the associated
costs _ from the federal government to states.
   Bush told the lawmakers he was committed to ``the return of
American political power to the states. That's where it began;
that's where it belongs.''

   President F.W. de Klerk accused
his right-wing opponents Friday of stirring up black-white
animosity that could plunge South Africa into a race war.
   In Johannesburg, police beat blacks with batons and chased
hundreds through downtown streets to break up a peaceful
anti-apartheid demonstration in which they marked their first week
of new freedoms.
   And 22 senior anti-apartheid leaders met with Nelson Mandela but
said the jailed African National Congress leader had no information
on his release, which is widely expected this month.
   De Klerk, responding to his critics in the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party, said his National Party ``talks renewal and
courage, and they talk racism and aggression.''
   On Feb. 2, in a speech that launched a new era in South Africa,
de Klerk lifted restrictions on more than 60 opposition groups,
including Mandela's ANC guerrilla movement, and pledged to free
Mandela soon.
   The Conservatives, who won 31 percent of the white vote in
elections last year, say de Klerk has capitulated to the 28 million
black majority. They also have threatened to stage boycotts and
protest strikes.
   ``They (the Conservatives) will plunge this country into a
racial war,'' de Klerk told Parliament. But, he added, ``The
government and I will not allow anyone or any party to set fire to
this country.''
   De Klerk said his own party, which has ruled South Africa since
1948, ``will still be here 10 to 20 years from now, looking after
the interests of its people and cooperating with the leaders of
other people.''
   De Klerk says he wants to bring South Africa's disenfranchised
blacks into the national government within five years. But he
opposes a one-man, one-vote system, the basic demand of all leading
anti-apartheid groups.
   At the Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town, the 22
anti-apartheid leaders met with Mandela in what they hoped was the
last such political strategy session before he is freed.
   ``His feeling was, at the end of the meeting ... how he wished
he could come home with us,'' said Murphy Morobe, one of the
activists.
   The delegation _ the largest yet to see Mandela at his house on
the prison farm _ included most members of the executive committee
of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid
coalition.
   The front's delegation gave Mandela a policy document that said
negotiations with the government could start only after democratic,
non-racial elections to form an assembly that would draft a new
constitution. De Klerk has rejected this demand.
   There are daily rumors that Mandela is about to be freed.
   However, according to sources, Mandela is expecting visitors
through Monday, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Neither the
government nor Jackson has confirmed the meeting date. The American
civil rights leader is on a 12-day tour of South Africa.
   Mandela, 71, is the country's best-known black leader and has
offered to serve as mediator in talks between the government and
the ANC. He has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping to launch the ANC's guerrilla campaign.
   In Johannesburg, more than 1,000 demonstrators rallied in St.
Mary's Anglican Church to mark last week's unbanning of the ANC.
   After the two-hour service, activists spilled out into a
pedestrian mall and began dancing and singing freedom songs. A
policeman ordered them to disperse, but within seconds his fellow
officers converged from both sides and began hitting the activists
with clubs.
   Police chased demonstrators through busy streets, toppling the
stalls of vendors and forcing cars to come to screeching halts.
   In several instances, police surrounded unarmed demonstrators
and hit them five or more times with their batons. Some activists
later hurled bottles and rocks at the police. Police arrested
several people and several more were hurt.
   De Klerk has said his government will permit peaceful protest if
advance permission is sought from authorities. On several recent
occasions police have dispersed peaceful crowds, calling the
demonstrations illegal.
   In another development, two whites who had been jailed for their
involvement with the African National Congress were released Friday.
   Barbara Hogan and Rob Adams, both sentenced to 10 years in 1982
for treason, were freed in Johannesburg.
   Dozens of activists jailed for belonging to the ANC and other
previously banned organizations are expected to be released now
that the groups are legal.
   ``The unbanning was a triumph for the movement and we both feel
vindicated for our involvement,'' Ms. Hogan said.

<TEXT>
   Fundamentalist Hindus decided Friday to
postpone building a temple at a disputed religious site claimed by
both Moslems and Hindus.
   Avaidyanath, a Hindu priest who uses one name, told reporters
the World Hindu Conference decided to postpone construction of the
temple for at least four months so the government can find a
solution to the long-running dispute.
   Construction was to have started Feb. 14 on land that also
contains a 16th century mosque.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said building the shrine would inflame
religious passions and lead to widespread violence, and he urged
Hindus to call off construction.
   ``We have decided to accept the prime minister's appeal,'' said
Avaidyanath, who wore the saffron robes of a Hindu ascetic. ``We'll
give him four months to solve the issue.''
   Last year, at least 300 people died in violence sparked by the
Hindu group's decision to build the temple and raze the mosque. The
foundation stone for the shrine was laid Nov. 9, but construction
was postponed because of the dispute.
   Hindus claim the site is the birthplace of the Rama, an
incarnation of Vishnu, one of the most important Hindu gods. They
say the Babri Masjid, or the mosque named after Moghal emperor
Babar, was built over Rama's birthplace.
   Moslems say it is difficult to say where Rama was born and they
will not accept destruction of their mosque.
   The issue has become a flashpoint for tensions between India's
majority Hindus, who make up 82 percent of its 880 million people,
and its Moslems, who form the country's largest minority but still
comprise only 12 percent of the population.
   The dispute became a major issue in last November's general
elections, and analysts say it was one of the causes of the
downfall of the previous prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh, his successor, has not come up with any specfic plan to
solve the problem but has promised to set up a government committee
to meet Hindu and Moslem representatves and try to come up with a
solution.
   ``The problem has been hanging for 450 years,'' said Ashok
Singhal, general secretary of the World Hindu Conference. ``Four
months more will not matter.''

   A former Unisys Corp. official was sentenced
to a year in prison Friday for conspiring to make illegal campaign
donations and obstructing the FBI's investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud.
   John B.G. Roberts III, a former marketing manager for the
defense contractor, was sentenced on his guilty plea to charges of
conspiracy to defraud the government and charges of obstruction of
justice.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., also
fined Roberts $10,000 and ordered him to serve a two-year term of
supervised release after completing the prison term.
   Roberts could have received a 10-year prison term for his guilty
plea.
   He admitted that he arranged for the submission of false claims
to the Pentagon for consultants' services when the money was
actually funneled to members of Congress who had infuence over
defense procurement.
   In pleading guilty Nov. 30, Roberts also admitted that he
arranged for the filing of false statements with the Federal
Election Commission to conceal illegal corporate donations to a
number of lawmakers.
   Roberts admitted that he suggested to defense consultants
working for Unisys how much money to donate to various lawmakers'
campaign funds and prepared figures for the company's annual budget.
   Several Unisys consultants have pleaded guilty in connection
with making illegal campaign contributions. Dennis Mitchell, a
former Unisys Corp. official, received a 90-day prison term in a
halfway house for arranging $4,000 worth of illegal campaign
contributions.
   Donations went to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; the late Rep.
Joseph D. Addabbo, D-N.Y., who chaired the House defense
appropriations subcommittee; Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.; Rep. Roy
Dyson, D-Md.; Rep. Bill Young, D-Fla., and the late Rep. Bill
Chappell, D-Fla.
   Prosecutors have said they found no evidence that the lawmakers
had known their campaign funds were receiving illegal donations.
   Roberts also admitted that he destroyed documents in his home
when he first learned about the FBI's investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''

   A Tunisian accused of directing a bombing campaign
that killed 13 people in Paris said in court Friday that his trial
marked the beginning of a holy war against the West.
   Fouad Ali Saleh and nine others face 10 years to 20 years in
prison if convicted on charges of terrorist conspiracy, possession
of illegal arms, trafficking in explosives and a variety of drug
offenses.
   The trial closed Friday after two weeks. A verdict is expected
March 9.
   Saleh, 31, his French wife Karima, and eight other men are to be
tried again later this year on murder charges in connection with
the wave of bombings that killed 13 people and injured 250 in 1986.
   Eight other people are being tried in absentia in the current
trial.
   Judge Henri Malergue offered Saleh a chance to speak in his
defense, and the defendent began by invoking the ``name of God, all
powerful.''
   ``Today this criminal trial of the West is the prelude to the
big war promised by God in the Koran. The crimes (of the West) are
unpardonable and the punishment will be apocalyptic. ... You are
the barbarians, Judeo-Christians, not us,'' he said.
   He went on until the judge stopped him 25 minutes later.
   Police say Saleh recruited and directed terrorists who hid
explosives smuggled in from Lebanon and placed the bombs at key
locations around Paris.
   He is accused of taking orders from leaders of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah extremist movement in Lebanon.

one of Israel's strongest supporters when it was founded in 1948.
   Arens paid tribute to Prague's supplies of weapons and training
of Air Force pilots during that period, noting that
``Czechoslovakia was one of the few nations that lent important
assistance to Israel in its hour of need during the war of
independence in 1948.''
   Czechoslovakia and other East bloc nations followed Moscow's
mandate and broke ties with Israel because of the 1967 Middle East
War. Romania maintained ties at the time and East Germany never had
established relations.
   Since the revolts that toppled old Communist regimes in Eastern
Europe, Soviet bloc nations have been moving toward a more Western
orientation in their foreign policies.
   Czechoslovakia became the second Soviet bloc nation to
re-establish ties with Israel, after Hungary.
   On Friday, Hungary became the second nation to restore relations
with the Vatican, following Poland last year.
   Arens told Czechoslovak television late Friday he expected
relations with Poland to be resumed by the end of this month, and
with all other East European nations and the Soviet Union within
months.
   East Germany has never had relations with Israel because of East
Berlin`s consistent refusal in the past to acknowledge any guilt
for the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews, or to pay
compensation to victims.
   Now, however, East German Premier Hans Modrow has acknowledged
East Germany's part in the Nazi past.
   Arens declined to react to Modrow's statement, saying only that
it would be very carefully examined. ``Initial contacts'' between
the Israeli and East German Foreign Ministries on establishing ties
had identified the admission of guilt as a key issue, he noted.
   Dienstbier signaled the clean break that he and President Vaclav
Havel are trying to make with the Communist past.
   ``I'm very happy that we could meet and remedy that nonsense of
cutting off relations with Israel,'' Dienstbier told Arens. The
Israeli in turn said his nation is watching Czechoslovakia`s
transition to democracy ``with great sympathy and admiration.''
   Czechoslovakia has long maintained ties with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, elevating those to full diplomatic
relations in 1988.
   Havel has offered to mediate in the Middle East if required.
Havel and Arens discussed that offer Friday afternoon, with the
Israeli thanking Czechoslovakia for its concern for peace, the
state news agency CTK said.
   It said Havel was invited to visit Israel, but made no mention
of whether his offer to mediate would be taken up.
   Before signing Friday's agreement, Arens toured Prague's ancient
Jewish Quarter and visited the former site of a Nazi concentration
camp at Theresienstadt.
   Before World War II, there were 240,000 Jews in Czechoslovakia.
Prague was for centuries one of the leading centers of Jewish
education and culture.
   Today, there are only about 6,000 Jews in Czechoslovakia, most
of them in the capital.

<HEAD>Accountant Says Collapsed Thrift was `Giving Its Money Away'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association ``was
manufacturing profits by giving its money away,'' an accountant who
examined Lincoln's books at the government's request testified
Friday.
   Roger Johnson said in U.S. District Court that the collapsed
thrift, owned by Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating and seized by
federal regulators last April, recorded $135 million in pre-tax
gains on 15 land transactions in 1986 and 1987.
   In reality, however, there was ``a net outflow of cash from
Lincoln'' in each instance, said Johnson, a certified public
accountant for Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
   The net cash expended by Lincoln to accomplish the sales totaled
$217 million, according to a draft of a report prepared last July
by Johnson's firm and introduced in court.
   Reading from the report, Johnson said the Irvine, Calif., thrift
was ``made to function as an engine designed to funnel insured
deposits'' to Keating's Phoenix holding company, the American
Continental Corp.
   The cash outflow is ``precisely the opposite of what you would
expect. ... The profits reported should have been reversed,''
Johnson told U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   Lincoln is suing the government's Office of Thrift Supervision,
seeking a court order to remove the conservatorship and
receivership regulators imposed last year to seize control of the
thrift.
   American Continental Corp. benefited from the 15 transactions
under a tax-sharing agreement in which Lincoln made payments to its
parent.
   ``Seldom in our experience as accountants have we encountered a
more egregious example of the misapplication of generally accepted
accounting principles,'' testified Johnson, reading from the report.
   Lincoln ``created profits by making loans. Many of the loans
were bad,'' said Johnson. ``Lincoln was manufacturing profits by
giving its money away.''
   In two hours of testimony, Johnson described a series of deals
in which Lincoln sold land to buyers who didn't have enough cash to
make the down payment. Ten of the 15 transactions involved an area
in Arizona known as Hidden Valley, 8,500 acres which Johnson
testified likely won't be developed ``during the remainder of this
century.''
   In one transaction, Lincoln received a $3.5 million cash down
payment for the sale of 1,000 acres to Westcontinental Mortgage
Investment Corp., a firm with only $87,000 in assets.
   Westcontinental got the down payment the day before the sale
from a company operated by businessman E.C. Garcia. Garcia's
company, in turn, had received $19.6 million from Lincoln the same
day Garcia lent the $3.5 million to Westcontinental.
   Calling Westcontinental a ``straw buyer,'' Johnson said Garcia
placed the property involved in the sale on his books in June 1988.
Johnson said ``we find no evidence'' that Westcontinental or Garcia
has paid any principal or interest on a $10.5 million note held by
Lincoln for the remainder of the deal. Lincoln reported an $11.1
million profit in the transaction.
   Garcia, who had no loans outstanding with Lincoln at the
beginning of 1987, had $128 million outstanding by the end of that
year, said Johnson.

<HEAD>Gorbachev to `Wait And See' About Campaigning for Job</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday refused
to say whether he would run in a campaign to keep his job, a
once-unthinkable scenario made possible by his party's historic
acceptance of a multiparty system and direct elections.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he said in a relaxed encounter with
reporters. Gorbachev is riding high on success after persuading the
Communist Party Central Committee Wednesday to adopt a new platform
favoring reforms.
   Besides opening the way for competition with new parties and
abolishing the party's constitutionally guaranteed leading role,
the platform favors a stronger presidency to be filled in a
contested election.
   Gorbachev has never faced a popular election during his five
years in power. The Soviet parliament named him to a five-year term
last summer, and there has been speculation that he will be allowed
to serve a second term without having to submit to voters.
   There also has been speculation that Gorbachev eventually will
step down as leader of his splintering party and concentrate on his
duties in a strengthened presidency.
   Gorbachev told reporters that the party platform contains only
the current stage of his long-planned reforms.
   ``Once we have solidified this phase, we will move on,'' he said.
   The changes pushed through the Central Committee had been in the
works since he took power five years ago, Gorbachev said.
   ``It certainly would be wrong for the West and everyone to
believe we began these changes only in the last few days,'' he
said. ``They have been under way since 1985.''
   Gorbachev made his comments before meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, who is in Moscow in hopes of forging
an arms agreement to be signed at the June summit.
   One of Gorbachev's assistants, meanwhile, offered the first
high-level warning that the Communist Party must reform or lose
power to the opponents it has agreed to legalize.
   ``A choice stands before the party in the conditions of
political pluralism: Restructure itself and struggle to show in
competition its right to be the ruling party, or slide into
opposition, and maybe even leave the political arena,'' economist
Nikolai Petrakov said in an interview with the official Tass news
agency.
   Petrakov also said the party's platform accepts private
ownership of factories, which would amount to a second dramatic
reversal of long-standing Soviet policy.
   The economic section is based on ``many forms of ownership of
the means of production and other things, including cooperative and
individual property,'' he said. In Marxist jargon, ``means of
production'' are factories and equipment.
   Other Soviet officials have said the platform bans property that
involves ``exploitation of the working man,'' defined as the
appropriation of some of the value created by a laborer.
   The contradiction implies that the Kremlin leadership plans to
redefine Marxist terms to fit the new policy.
   Activists have criticized the new Communist platform as
inadequate because the party will continue to exert control through
party units in factories, army units, the police, courts and most
public organizations.
   But on Friday, an official Soviet trade union cut its ties with
the party and government, Tass reported Friday.
   Tass said the action by the fishing industry union was a first
for the Soviet Union. Official unions have been used for decades to
keep workers under control and prevent strikes. The fishing union
also took control of its own budget and set up a strike fund, Tass
said.

<HEAD>Auction House Shows Off Ancient Silver Collection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of 14 ancient silver dishes worth
an estimated $70 million that will ``rewrite the history of Roman
art'' will be sold unless its authenticity or ownership is
challenged, Sotheby's said Friday.
   The Sevso Treasure has four large plates, five pitchers, a tall
jar, two buckets, a basin, a lady's toilet casket and the
copper-alloy cauldron in which the silver was believed to have been
found in Lebanon in the mid-1970s.
   The pieces, decorated with mythological and contemporary figures
of the fourth and fifth centuries, in total outweigh the combined
weight of the 98 pieces of the two other main silver treasures of
the period, the auction house said.
   ``Every time I look at it I get goose pimples,'' said Marcus
Linell, senior director of Sotheby's of Europe. ``It is a startling
find in every respect.''
   ``It is so good and so grand and of such good quality that it
will make a reappraisal of the art of the period necessary,'' he
said.
   ``This is an incredible moment,'' said Michael L. Ainslie,
president of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. ``This is the most important
collection of Roman silver known to exist. This will rewrite the
history of Roman art.''
   He said Sotheby's was estimating its worth at $70 million but
added that the treasure was too unusual to easily put a price tag
on.
   But one reason Sotheby's is displaying the collection is to
spread the word in case anyone wants to challenge its ownership or
authenticity. If not, it is expected to be offered in the fall in
Zurich, Switzerland by Sotheby's, which also plans to entertain
private offers.
   Sotheby's says it has confirmed the collection's authenticity
through extensive laboratory testing as well as scholarly and
scientific research.
   It also had the owner's export licenses examined and ratified by
the Lebanese Embassy in Switzerland and sent descriptions and
photographs of each piece to cultural attaches in Switzerland for
each of the 29 countries which were in or part of the Roman Empire
in the fourth century.
   To increase scrutiny of the collection, Sotheby's announced it
would publicly display it from Saturday to Feb. 20, while 5,000
scholars and academics gather for the College Art Association
conference.
   The collection was acquired piecemeal during the 1980s from its
owner in Lebanon by the Marquess of Northampton Settlement, a
family trust in Guernsey, England. Linell refused to disclose how
much the estate paid for the silver.
   The collection was named after a hunting plate which carried the
name of its owner, Sevso.
   Linell said it was likely that the person who discovered the
treasure sought anonymity so others would not know about the money
paid for the silver.

   Orange harvest prospects have improved from a
month ago, but production is still down sharply from last season
because of widespread freeze damage in late December, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The new estimate of 169 million boxes was based on Feb. 1
indications and is up 7 percent from the January forecast of fewer
than 158 million boxes.
   Even so, the freeze-damaged crops is expected to be down 19
percent from 209 million boxes in 1988-89. Most of the reduction
was attributed to a 32 percent decline in the Florida crop.
   ``The severe freeze in Florida's citrus belt on Dec. 24-25
further reduced an already short orange crop,'' the report said.
``The increase (in total output) from last month reflects
better-than-expected salvage operation in Florida and increased
expectations in California.''
   Florida's orange harvest was estimated at 100 million boxes,
down from 146.6 million last season but up from 92 million forecast
last month.
   The Texas crop was forecast at 1.2 million boxes, down from 1.85
million in 1988-89 and 1.25 million forecast in January. California
production, estimated at 66 million boxes, is up from 58.8 million
last season and 63 million indicated last month.
   Arizona production was expected to be 1.7 million boxes,
unchanged from January and the same as last season.
   Total grapefruit production was forecast at 41.6 million boxes,
down 9 percent from the January forecast and 36 percent below last
year, reflecting the freeze in Florida and Texas.
   ``Higher-than-expected fruit droppage in Florida due to the
freeze is a main reason for this continued decline,'' the report
said.
   Florida grapefruit production was estimated at 34 million boxes,
down 11 percent from January's forecast and 39 percent below last
season. The Texas crop, unchanged from January, was forecast at 2
million boxes, down 58 percent from 1988-89.

<HEAD>Atlanta Mayor Proposes Licenses for Beggars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the homeless are blasting a
proposal under consideration by Mayor Maynard Jackson to require
people who want to beg for money to buy a license first.
   The licenses are part of a proposed program that would also
include counseling and job-placement programs paid for by local
businesses. Details including the license fee haven't been worked
out.
   ``We're going to present the strongest law possible because it
(begging) has gotten out of hand,'' Jackson said this week, adding
that he plans to offer his panhandling plan within a month.
   As many as 10,000 homeless people live in Atlanta, said Anita
Beaty, co-director of the Task Force for the Homeless.
   Ed Loring, director of the Open Door Community, an Atlanta
shelter, called the license proposal ``awful''
   ``A person with enough money to get a license is not a
panhandler,'' he said.
   But the licensing plan is supported by some downtown business
leaders.
   ``Business leaders are concerned about street crime, about
panhandling that goes far beyond begging and about the conduct of
some people who are being abusive,'' said Joe Martin, president of
Central Atlanta Progress.
   ``At the same time, we feel it's important to take a positive
approach to the needs of the homeless, including providing
opportunities for temporary and permanent jobs and forging a
comprehensive strategy to deal with the causes of the problem,'' he
said.
   Atlanta already has a law that makes panhandling illegal, but it
is rarely enforced. A federal judge in New York recently said a
rule banning panhandlers from that city's subway system and bus and
rail stations could not be enforced. He said begging is protected
free speech.
   After his ruling, the New York agency that runs the bus and rail
stations began issuing permits to beggars, as it does to anyone who
wants to solicit.
   But an appeals court has put the New York ruling on hold, and
panhandling is again illegal.
   Jackson said he personally sympathizes with beggars.
   ``Ninety percent of the people who panhandle have no money and
are desperate, and they beg,'' he said. ``My policy is when someone
asks for money, I give it.''

   The former fashion model who helped the FBI
arrest Washington Mayor Marion Barry got a continuance in her
drunken-driving case.
   Hazel Diane Moore, 38, of Burbank, also known as Rasheeda Moore,
was to be arraigned March 2 in Van Nuys Municipal Court, under an
order issued Friday by court Commissioner Mitchell Block.
   Ms. Moore, who did not appear in court, was arrested Jan. 1 for
investigation of driving under the influence. Her blood alcohol
level was 0.12 percent, over the legal limit of 0.08 percent,
police said.
   Ms. Moore, a friend of Barry's, worked as an undercover
informant for the FBI, calling Barry to a Washington hotel room
where he was arrested Jan. 18 for investigation of possessing
cocaine.
   Ms. Moore's attorney in the drunken-driving case, Ronald J.
Lewis, said Ms. Moore will probably plead no contest at her
arraignment, depending on the outcome of discussions with the city
attorney's office.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III will make a stopover Saturday in Bulgaria en route from Moscow
to Romania, the state BTA news agency reported.
   The one-paragraph dispatch Friday offered no details beyond
saying Baker would arrive in the afternoon. It will be the first
visit to Bulgaria by a U.S. Secretary of State.
   Baker's visit to Romania was announced earlier Friday. He is the
highest-ranked American government official to come to Bucharest
since the December revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu and ended two decades of Communist Party rule.
   Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's hard-line Communist ruler, was ousted
in November, and his more reform-minded Communist successors have
promised free elections and other reforms.
   Baker's brief visits to the two countries appear meant to signal
American interest in the process of democratization. In Romania's
case, the visit also seems calculated to defuse criticism by
Romanian officials that Washington's reluctance to send a ranking
official signals disinterest in the reforms.
   U.S. officials have been cautious about the chances of true
democracy in the two countries. While both plan elections in May,
the officials have pointed to the continued Communist grip on power
in Bulgaria and to the prolonged reluctance of Romania's
self-installed interim government to share the running of the
country pending the planned elections.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party suffered
another setback Friday with the announcement that three reformers
quit the party leadership, one week after they were voted into the
newly created Supreme Council.
   The state news agency BTA said all three representatatives of
the Alternative Socialist Organization _ Koprinka Chervenkova,
Kiril Vassilev and Ivan Nikolov _ quit the 153-member Supreme
Council. The ASO is a reformist faction within the party.
   The party is in a deep identity crisis, and the resignations
thwarted efforts by senior leaders to give it a more progressive
public image.
   An even more serious challenge faces the party.
   Nikolai Vassilev, leader of the Alternative Socialists and Kiril
Vassilev's son, told The Associated Press on Wednesday he expected
two-thirds of delegates to an ASO congress on Feb.11 to vote to
leave the Communist Party and reform along Social Democratic lines
as an Alternative Socialist Party.
   At a four-day Communist Party congress ending Feb. 2, new party
chief Alexander Lilov and other major officials said the party had
parted with Stalinism and was embarking on a road of ``socialist
democracy.''
   On Thursday, new Premier Andrei Lukanov presented to Parliament
the country's first all-Communist government, admitting failure to
persuade members of the democratic opposition to join it.
   The Agrarian Party, for decades a docile ally of the Communists
in the Cabinet, refused to join Lukanov's government. It said it
would not make sense to be in a ``government of national concord''
that does not include the opposition.
   Ms. Chervenkova announced her resignation on Tuesday. Kiril
Vassilev and Nikolov said they were stepping down in a declaration
published Friday in the Communist Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo.
   Rabotnichesko Delo had reported on Thursday that another Supreme
Council member, Hristo Ganev, had quit.
   Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist ruler for 35 years, was
driven from power last November in the pro-democracy reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe.

   Space shuttle managers began a
two-day meeting Friday to select a date for launching Atlantis on a
classified military mission.
   The working target has been Feb. 22, but officials want to
assess the readiness of all launch elements before setting a firm
date Saturday.
   NASA said a delay in replacing a faulty engine turbopump could
cause a one-day slip, but the agency said it was hoping the time
could be made up. A new pump was installed Friday and leak checks
will be conducted Saturday.
   If the Feb. 22 date holds, Atlantis is scheduled to blast off at
1:14 a.m. with a crew of five astronauts.
   For security reasons, neither the Pentagon nor NASA will
identify the satellite, but sources close to the project report it
is a highly sophisticated reconnaissance satellite that will gather
information over the Soviet Union and a wide area of the globe.

<HEAD>MSG Hearing: Very Spicy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arguments on both sides of the monosodium
glutamate issue spiced up a hearing on a proposal to make
restaurants disclose their use of it.
   Leading the charge against MSG, a flavor enhancer, was San
Francisco Supervisor Wendy Nelder, whose proposal has angered
restaurateurs. At the hearing Thursday, Nelder accused her critics
of not caring whether diners live or die.
   ``It is really no skin off anyone's nose to make restaurateurs
let people know what they are eating,'' said Nelder.
   But restaurateurs disagreed.
   ``I've had more people with problems with mayonnaise,'' said
Colleen Meharry of Miz Brown's Restaurant. ``I have people who come
in and say they are allergic to mayonnaise, but I don't post that
mayonnaise is dangerous to them.''
   Supervisor Angela Alioto chimed in, ``Don't give her any ideas.''
   Nelder said Friday that her proposal would require restaurateurs
to put a small mark on their menus next to dishes that are made
with MSG.
   Among those who testified on behalf of Nelder's proposal was
Jack Samuels, an investment banker from Chicago who told the
committee, ``If I don't stay away from this stuff, I'm going to
die.''
   Samuel said he came to testify because ``San Francisco is a very
important, trend-setting city.''
   Apparently, the Atlanta-based Glutamate Association agreed,
because the trade organization _ comprised of MSG manufacturers _
has sent its executive director to San Francisco four times in the
past month to fight the proposal.
   The Food and Drug Administration, despite anecdotal evidence,
has categorized MSG as a safe ingredient.
   By the time the meeting ended, Nelder had stormed out, angry
because she didn't have enough votes to support the measure until
the city's health and small business commissions issue their
opinions. The committee will take up the issue again next month.

<HEAD>Imports Will Be Trimmed, Says USDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is expected to trim total
grain imports to about 38 million metric tons this year, up 1
million tons from estimates last month, the Agriculture Department
said Friday.
   But that would be down from 39 million tons of grain imported by
the Soviets in 1988-89. The imports are for the trade year that
runs from July 1 through the next June.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said Moscow
reported in late January a 1989 total grain harvest of 211.1
million tons. The department's earlier forecast of the Soviet
harvest was 208 million tons.
   A metric ton is approximately 2,205 pounds, about 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   Moscow's harvest figures would make the 1989 harvest one of the
largest on record, up from 195.1 million tons in 1988 but
fractionally below the 1987 harvest of 211.4 million tons,
according to the report. The record was 237.4 million tons in 1978.

   Foods as diverse as chocolate, sea
slugs and calf brains have been touted as aphrodisiacs throughout
history, says the co-author of a book on the subject.
   ``Almost everything you can think of has been used as an
aphrodisiac _ including tree bark, shark's fin and hippopotamus
snout,'' said George Armelagos, co-author of ``Consuming Passions.''
   Often foods perceived to enhance sexual desire simply may add to
physical or mental well-being because they are good sources of
protein, such as eggs, caviar and oysters, he said.
   ``The prune was thought to be such a strong aphrodisiac that the
brothels in Elizabethan England would serve them to their
customers,'' said Armelagos, chairman of the University of
Florida's anthropology department.
   When Ireland's population boomed, the English assumed the potato
was an aphrodisiac, he said.
   Many seafoods are considered erotic eating, partly because the
ancient goddesses of love, Aphrodite or Venus, were said to have
emerged from sea foam. One 17th-century French physician reported
that his people felt most amorous during Lent, when they ate a lot
of fish.
   Chocolate, a popular Valentine Day's gift, has a substance
called phenylethelalanine that accumulates in the pleasure centers
of the brain, mimicking what happens during sexual activity, he
said.
   Alcohol, especially champagne, is commonly thought to be an
aphrodisiac, reflecting poet Ogden Nash's sentiment that ``Candy's
dandy, but liquor's quicker,'' Armelagos said.
   ``Although champagne is a noted ingredient in seduction scenes,
whatever effectiveness it may have is probably due to the flattery
of being offered an expensive commodity,'' he said.
   Still, no food has ever been proven to be an aphrodisiac.
   ``The brain is the most important sexual organ,'' he said. ``If
you think Saltines will work, then you've got a good, cheap
aphrodisiac.''

   Because Mayor Morris Fisher changed
his mind, Pacific Grove's nickname ``Butterfly Town, U.S.A.''
remains appropriate.
   Last month, Fisher was with the majority as the City Council
voted 4-3 to allow development of 2.7 acres of privately owned
land, one of two nesting sites in town for monarch butterflies. But
on Wednesday, Fisher reversed his decision and the proposed
development was voted down.
   The Monterey Peninsula community is one of the best known
California nesting sites for the orange and black monarchs, who
migrate each autumn from Alaska and Canada. The butterflies nest in
pine and eucalyptus trees in Pacific Grove.
   Butterfly lovers from the area and elsewhere criticized the
council for its January vote.
   ``Even a partial elimination of the Pacific Grove monarchs would
be a very sad national loss,'' Edward O. Wilson, professor of
science at Harvard, wrote to the council.

<HEAD>Kathleen Sullivan to Leave as `CBS This Morning' Anchorwoman</HEAD>
<HEAD>By JAY SHARBUTT</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP Television Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what will be the second exit of a network
morning anchorwoman in a year's time, Kathleen Sullivan is being
replaced on ``CBS This Morning,'' her agent said Friday.
   CBS said it can't confirm or deny that.
   Sullivan, whose CBS contract expires in November, got the word
Wednesday in a meeting with CBS News President David Burke and
other executives, said her agent, Ron Konecky. No date is set for
her departure, he said.
   ``Not really,'' he said when asked if they gave any reason why
they wanted to replace her on the two-hour morning show that she
has co-anchored with Harry Smith since its premiere Nov. 30, 1987.
   ``I think that was a management decision they felt they had to
make,'' Konecky said. ``I'm having ongoing, positive meetings with
them with a view to other assignments for Kathleen at CBS.''
   There have been reports she will be succeeded by Paula Zahn,
co-anchor of ABC's ``World News This Morning,'' and the news
segments of the following ``Good Morning America.''
   Scott Richardson, an ABC spokesman, said he had no comment on
whether Zahn will leave ABC. CBS spokeswoman Terry Everett said CBS
can't confirm or deny if Sullivan, 36, is out at ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Asked if Sullivan's co-anchor, Smith, is staying at the CBS
show, a CBS official who spoke on condition he not be identified by
name said yes.
   From its start, the program has been a distant third in ratings
to ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's ``Today.'' Speaking last
October on the syndicated ``Donahue'' show last fall, Sullivan
predicted ``my days are numbered'' if the ratings didn't improve.
   Ironically, another anchorwoman appearing with her on
``Donahue'' was Jane Pauley, who as part of the most controverial
change in ``Today'' left that show in December after 13 years as
its co-host. She was succeeded in January by Deborah Norville.
   Sullivan co-anchored Friday's ``CBS This Morning'' from Atlanta.
During the broadcast, she made no mention of her impending
depature. Neither did Smith or news anchor Charles Osgood. She
couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
   Everett, who said the program will originate from Florida next
week, said Sullivan had gone to Atlanta on personal business.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network is based in Atlanta, but Konecky
said she wasn't there for talks with CNN officials, nor was he
negotiating with them for her.
   He said CBS officials have asked her to stay on at ``CBS This
Morning'' during its transition to a new anchorwoman ``and she's
happy to do so.''
   The news of Sullivan's impending exit, coupled with the
three-month payless suspension of ``60 Minutes'' humorist Andy
Rooney for a racial slur attributed to him, came at an awkward time
for CBS executives.
   A spokesman said that Burke, ``CBS This Morning'' executive
producer Erik Sorenson, and other CBS officials were in Phoenix on
Friday, attending a regional meeting of executives from
CBS-affiliated stations.

<HEAD>Deeper Crack Found in Damaged TMI Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crack in the steel barrier encasing the
damaged Three Mile Island nuclear reactor apparently is deeper than
initially thought, officials said Friday, raising new questions
about the severity of the 1979 accident at the plant.
   GPU Nuclear Corp. said in a statement that the discovery was
made Thursday, when scientists examined pictures of a metal sample
taken from the 5-inch thick bottom shield in the Unit 2 reactor.
   The discovery is ``an indication that the consequences of the
accident could have easily been much worse,'' Robert Pollard, a
nuclear safety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said.
   Pollard said he was surprised that the nuclear reactor remained
intact, adding, ``Apparently it did so by a small margin.''
   Company spokeswoman Mary Wells said what appeared to be surface
cracks in a steel lining shield were discovered last summer. New
pictures show the crack apparently extended through the lining and
into the bottom steel wall of the reactor.
   The company's statement said the crack appears to extend most of
the way through the 3-inch thick sample cut from the reactor bottom.
   Ms. Wells said the steel wall that contains the apparent crack
is ``the final steel wall before we get to concrete.'' A 13-feet
thick concrete wall separates the shield and the reactor from the
ground.
   Ms. Wells said it is too soon to tell if the discovery means the
accident was more serious.
   ``This is a sample and it has to be analyzed,'' she said. ``When
all the scientists have analyzed them, they will draw the
conclusion as to what it means.''
   She said, however, that there is no indication that radioactive
material escaped from the reactor vessel.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified of the
development, but spokesman Frank Ingram agreed it was too soon to
draw conclusions.
   Eric Epstein, of the anti-nuclear group Three Mile Island Alert,
said the finding ``clearly indicates that we do not know the full
extent of the damage to the reactor. We question whether the plant
is in a stable condition.''
   The 1979 accident was caused by a combination of human and
mechanical errors, which resulted in protective cooling water being
drained from the reactor. It is considered the worst commercial
nuclear accident in the United States.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Agriculture Department agencies have
committed $3.3 million this year to water-quality demonstration
projects in eight states, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced Friday.
   Yeutter said USDA plans to add 16 more projects over the next
five years to ``accelerate the adoption of water quality technology
that's been developed but hasn't yet achieved widespread
recognition.''
   The agencies involved are the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, $900,000; Economic Research
Service, $150,000; Extension Service, $1 million; Forest Service,
$100,000; and Soil Conservation Service, $1.1 million.
   Projects listed by Yeutter included:
   _California. Sacramento Valley Demonstration Project (Butte,
Colusa, Sutter and Yuba counties), the economic and environmental
feasibility of pesticide management practices that reduce pesticide
residue levels in irrigation return flow water.
   _Florida. Lake Manatee Watershed Demonstration Project (Manatee
County), the use of profitable irrigation and crop management
systems, based on computer decisions models, for the reduction of
fertilizer and pesticide loadings to surface and groundwater.
   _Maryland. Monocacy River Watershed Demonstration Project
(Carroll, Frederick and Montgomery counties), focus on economically
feasible and environmentally effective methods for farmers to
reduce the application of fertilizers and properly manage animal
wastes, thus reducing the potential to pollute surface and
groundwater.
   _Minnesota. Anoka Sand Plain Demonstration Project (Anoka,
Benton, Chisago, Hennepin, Isanti, Mille Lacs, Ramsey, Sherburne,
Stearnes, Washington and Wright counties), demostrate
cost-effective nutrient and crop management systems that reduce
loadings of nitrates and pesticides in a groundwater recharge area.
   _Nebraska. Mid-Nebraska Water Quality Demonstration Project
(Adams, Butler, Clay, Fillmore, Hamilton, Kearney, Polk, Seward,
York and Webster counties), demonstrate on irrigated cropland the
integrated use of cost-effective nitrogen, irrigation and pest
management to reduce chemical inputs, production costs and
groundwater contamination.
   _North Carolina. Herrings Marsh Run Demonstration Project
(northwestern Duplin County), demonstrate crop and nutrient
management systems that maintain farm profitability and reduce
pesticide and nutrient loadings to both ground and surface waters
in areas with shallow groundwater tables.
   _Texas. Seco Creek Demonstration Project (Bandera, Medina and
Uvalde counties), demonstrate cost-effective vegetative management
systems to increase water yield and reduce pesticide and nitrogen
leaching in a groundwater recharge area.
   _Wisconsin. East Rover Watershed Demonstration Project (Brown
County), demonstrate crop management systems that reduce the level
of nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides required to produce
competitive crops, thus enhancing farmers' net income and reducing
the loading of nutrients and pesticides to surface and groundwater.

   The capital's 17,000 taxis were idle
Friday after their owners went on strike to protest an
anti-pollution measure banning some of their cars from the
smog-choked city center.
   The new measures announced Thursday bans taxis and other
vehicles without required smog control devices from downtown during
weekdays.
   It was another in a series of official moves aimed at improving
the flow of traffic in Athens and to combat pollution. Previous
measures have proved to be ineffective.
   The taxi owners, staging a 24-hour strike, denounced the
arbitrary decisions taken without consulting them and said their
income would be seriously affected.
   Environment and Public Works Minister Costas Liaskas said taxis
and other vehicles equipped with anti-pollution devices would be
permitted to circulate within the restricted zone.
   New car buyers would be granted tax discounts as an incentive to
buy cars with the latest technology, he added.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. diplomat said Friday that
Colombia and the United States had never cooperated more closely in
the antidrug war, but a Colombian economist suggested the economy
here could collapse if that war succeeds.
   The statements came days before President Bush is to join
presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Alan Garcia of Peru and
Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia in Cartagena, Colombia, to discuss ways
of better cooperating in the fight.
   Bolivia and Peru together produce most of the coca leaf used to
make the world's cocaine. Colombia is the processing center before
the drug is smuggled abroad, and the United States is the world's
largest consumer of cocaine.
   ``To me the real story leading up to the drug summit is the way
people in the United States and Latin American drug-producing
countries are beginning to talk about the problem in the same,
serious way,'' the U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told reporters at a briefing at the U.S. Embassy.
   He said he expected the Feb. 15 summit to produce ``the kind of
agreement in which each country that is part of the problem becomes
part of the solution.''
   Since August, Colombia has intensified a crackdown on
traffickers that drew praise from U.S. officials.
   But the crackdown, focusing on capturing traffickers responsible
for a terrorist campaign here, has failed to significantly reduce
the supply of cocaine reaching the United States, U.S. officials
say.
   Colombian officials, economists and news commentators complain
in turn that Colombia is spilling its blood to protect U.S.
interests while the Bush administration fails to compensate it
economically for the effort.
   Bogota economist Salamon Kalmanowitz says in an interview
published in El Espectador newspaper, ``Colombia should demand from
the United States adequate compensation for the losses, both human
and material that the war against drug trafficking has produced.''
   Kalmanowitz, a professor at the Bogota's National University,
said drug traffickers invested $6.5 billion in Colombia over the
last 10 years and predicted an economic collapse if the drug fight
continues without what he calls adequate compensation.
   He said Colombian drug traffickers also invested $35 billion in
other countries, including the United States, the past decade.
   ``If we add up the value of all of Colombia's equity inside the
country and abroad, we see that 35 percent of the national wealth
accumulated over 100 years of modern history is in the hands of a
bourgeois class of gansters,'' Kalmanowitz said.
   Kalmanowitz has spent years analyzing the possible economic
impact here of an end to the drug trade, but did not spell out in
the interview how he arrived at his figures.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials here have
questioned how Kalmanowitz and other economists obtain their
information on the the shadowy drug trade, but have rarely disputed
the results of the studies.
   The Bogota economic magazine Coyuntura Economica calculated last
December that drug traffickers' foreign exchange profits accounted
for 3.8 percent of Colombia's annual gross national product,
estimated at $40 billion.
   It said the drug trade accounted for 3 percent of national
employment.
   The United States gave Colombia $20 million in economic aid and
$80 million in military assistance in 1989, the U.S. official said.
   He said military aid will rise to $95 million in 1990, and that
the amount of economic aid will be announced at the summit.
   Colombian officials have indicated that the amount of aid
planned for Colombia this year by the Bush Administration falls
short. Ambassador Victor Mosquera Chaux told a congressional
committee in Washington last month that Colombia will need $1
billion a year in economic and military assistance.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono said in a recent interview in El
Espectador that more economic cooperation was needed between the
two countries if the drug war was to succeed..
   Colombia asked the United States to help it renegotiate an
international coffee pact broken last year, resulting in a steep
drop in coffee prices.
   Coffee is Colombia's top official export. The price drop has
already cost Colombia $187 million and Barco says it stands to lose
up to $400 million a year.

   A student described by his mother as ``very
disturbed'' crashed a car into the gate of President Hosni
Mubarak's residence Friday and was killed in a gunfight with
guards, the government said.
   Mubarak was visiting the southern city of Aswan.
   A government statement carried by the official Middle East News
Agency said Adham Shoheib Mohamed Hafez, 17, smashed the Fiat he
was driving into the iron gate, got out and shot at the guards,
wounding two before they fired back and killed him.
   The state news agency quoted Mubarak in Aswan as expressing
``pain, sorrow and astonishment'' on learning of the shooting.
   The president said he was ``affected'' by the incident because
it was committed by a youth who belongs to a ``good family,''
according to the agency, which said the boy was carrying a Smith
and Wesson pistol registered in his father's name.
   The statement quoted Hafez's mother as saying her son was ``very
disturbed'' over family problems when left home in the Heliopolis
district, the district that also includes the presidential
residence.
   She said her son threatened to ``commit a terrible act'' unless
the family met his demands, the statement said without elaboration.
   A reporter who visited the scene said the situation was normal,
except for a small crowd of spectators.

<HEAD>Federal Set-Asides Should be Scrutinized: Justice Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal set-asides for minority businesses
should be given the same ``strict scrutiny'' that the Supreme Court
applies to state and local programs, the Justice Department said
Friday.
   ``Any such racial classificiation must be narrowly tailored to
achieve the compelling governmental interest identified by
Congress,'' the Justice Department said in a filing with the
Supreme Court.
   The Justice Department made its statement in a
friend-of-the-court brief filed in a case challenging the Federal
Communications Commission's policy of giving preference to minority
businesses seeking broadcast licenses.
   The high court is considering a challenge to the FCC policy of
giving extra weight to applications for broadcast licenses by
businesses owned by blacks, women, Hispanics or other minorities.
   The Justice Department said the same standard under which the
high court last year threw out a minority set-aside program for
construction contracts in Richmond, Va., should be applied to the
FCC case.
   ``In our view, racial classifications adopted by the federal
government must also withstand the `strict scrutiny' applied to
those adopted by state and local governments,'' the Justice
Department said.
   ``Thus, federal minority preference programs, no less than state
and local programs, must serve a compelling government interest and
by narrowly tailored to achieve that interest,'' the department
said.
   The Justice Department said the high court owed ``greater
deference'' to a finding by Congress that ``there is compelling
need for remedial action'' than a similar conclusion by a state or
local government.
   Nevertheless, ``there remain important limitations on Congress'
power to adopt racial preferences.''
   ``But this additional measure of deference is appropriate only
if Congress itself makes the critical determination that such a
program is required, and only if this determination has an adequate
basis in fact,'' the department said.
   ``And any such racial classification must be narrowly tailored
to achieve a compelling governmental interest identified by
Congress.''
   When the Supreme Court upheld a federal minority-set aside
program for construction contracts in 1980, it found that
``Congress had abundance evidence'' that discriminatory practices
had hurt minority contractors, the department said.
   The Justice Department said the high court should not give any
deference to the FCC's policy of giving preference to minority
license because the program was not specifically mandated by
Congress.
   ``Here, there can be no claim that Congress had before it
evidence suggesting that minorities have been denied any
opportunity to acquire broadcasting facilities because of official
or private acts of discrimination.''
   The Justice Department said it found no legal support ``for the
proposition that a federal administrative agency, acting under a
general grand of authority to regulate a particular industry in the
public interest, should be entitled to any special deference if it
makes a finding of prior discrimination within that industry ...
that might support the use of racial classifications.''

   Soviet military leaders on Friday toured
Las Alamos National Laboratory, where they viewed Strategic Defense
Initiative research and a project intended to develop nuclear
fusion technology.
   Ten members of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Defense and State
Security received briefings and tours of two Los Alamos projects
during the half-day visit. The event was a counterpart to a U.S.
tour of Soviet military installations last fall.
   Accompanied by Soviet scientists, officials and interpreters,
committee members saw parts of an experiment to develop a device
that would fire a so-called particle beam in space. They also saw
the Aurora laser project, part of an effort to develop nuclear
fusion, a technology cleaner that the current fission process used
in nuclear-powered electric plants.
   Reporters were excluded from the tour and officials gave only a
sketchy account.
   In response to a reporter's shouted question ``What do you want
to see here?'' and relayed through a translator, a member of the
Soviet delegation responded, ``You,'' and gestured with a smile at
the laboratory.
   The group was led by committee Chairman Vladimir Lapygin, who
was greeted at the lab's main headquarters by James Jackson, deputy
director of Los Alamos. Rep. Steve Schiff, R-N.M., and four members
of the House Armed Services Committee accompanied the Soviets.
   Schiff said that during the delegation's 60-mile helicopter ride
from Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque he discussed the Soviet
government with some of the visitors.
   He said the Soviets were interested in seeing any research they
could at the government-funded Los Alamos lab, one of the stops on
a nationwide tour of research facilities.
   The tour was part of a U.S.-Soviet arms monitoring accord and
follows a tour of the Soviet Union by the Armed Services Committee
in August.
   The delegation was headed to San Diego after the Los Alamos
visit.
   The $60 million particle beam program, part of the SDI or ``Star

<HEAD>Family Allowed to Visit Jailed Journalist for First Time</HEAD>

   A prominent Chinese journalist who was arrested
eight months ago for supporting pro-democracy students recently was
allowed a visit from her family, her daughter said Friday.
   Dai Qing's husband and daughter visited her for the first time
at Qincheng prison on the outskirts of Beijing late last month,
just before the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in China.
   Wang Xiaojia, the daughter, denied a news report in Hong Kong
that her mother had been released from prison and put under house
arrest.
   Authorities told the family the investigation of Dai's case was
completed recently but she would continue to be held under
``guardianship,'' Wang said, and the family had no idea when she
might be freed.
   Dai worked for the Guangming Daily, a newspaper for
intellectuals. She was one of China's most prominent journalists,
well-known for critical, frank reports on political, environmental
and feminist issues.
   She joined other journalists last spring in calling for
guarantees of greater press freedom. On May 14, fearing a
crackdown, she pleaded with student demonstrators to leave
Tiananmen Square.
   Immediately after soldiers drove the protesters from the square
June 3-4, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed
civilians, Dai publicly resigned from the Communist Party.
   Security forces took the journalist from her home July 13.
   Wang said her mother seemed well and appeared to be holding up
emotionally. She said Dai did not appear to have been beaten and
was not handcuffed or restrained during the hour in a visitors'
room.
   Wang, 21, said it was the first time she and her father were
allowed to visit Dai.
   ``We brought her some food _ chocolates and packaged meat,'' she
said. ``Mostly, we just talked about family matters.''
   Wen Wei Po, a newspaper in Hong Kong that supports Beijing, said
last week Chinese authorities recently had allowed many imprisoned
pro-democracy activists to have visits from their relatives.
   The visits coincided with the Lunar New Year and were granted to
``intellectuals and academics,'' the paper reported.
   It said Wang Dan, one of the democracy movement's top student
leaders, and Liu Xiaobo, a teacher who was a hunger striker, were
among those visited.
   The decision was made in tandem with the lifting of martial law
in Beijing in mid-January. It said both moves were to indicate that
China's political situation is ``daily becoming more stable.''

   An American man was found shot to death amid
ancient stone ruins in the Andean city of Cuzco, Peru's tourism
center and once the capital of the Incas, police said Friday.
   Cuzco police spokesman Maj. Rafael Zavala said the body was
found shot in the head on Thursday at Sacsayhuaman, a group of huge
Incan stone ruins on a hill that overlooks the city.
   Zavala said a U.S. passport carrying the name Charles John
Williams, 42, was found with the victim.
   However, the State Department in Washington identified the dead
American as William Carlos Yount, 41, of Southern Pines, N.C., and
said no American named Williams had died in Cuzco.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Tom Leary said in Lima that police
notified the embassy of the death and embassy personnel went to
Cuzco to bring back the body.
   Zavala said he had no information on whether the victim was a
tourist or how long he had been in Cuzco, which is 355 miles
southwest of Lima. He said police had no suspects, but that the
investigation was continuing.
   Tourism is a major source of revenue in Peru, bringing more than
$400 million a year into the country, according to the government.
   However, the number of tourists coming to Peru has dropped for
several years due to guerrilla violence that is affecting much of
the Andean highlands and some urban areas.
   Cuzco has been relatively unaffected by the political violence,
and thousands of tourists still pour through the city each year.
   Police said earlier Friday that Maoist guerrillas of the Shining
Path shot nine people to death in scattered violence throughout
Peru.
   The victims included two policemen, a teacher, a government
worker, and three men the rebels accused of stealing cattle. Two
women also were killed in their home.
   The policemen were gunned down in an outlying district of Lima
by a group of rebels in a passing truck Thursday night, police
said. The attackers stopped and took the victims' revolvers before
fleeing, the police said.
   The bodies of three men who had been shot were found Friday in
the highland village of San Pedro de Sano, 140 miles east of Lima.
   A handwritten sign found on one of the victims read, ``This is
how cattle rustlers die,'' police said.
   The village of 3,000 is currently without a local government.
The mayor, judge and police chief have resigned due to rebel
threats.
   Rebels killed a high school teacher Thursday by shooting him in
the head in his home in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima,
police said.
   Also Thursday, the bodies of a 45-year-old woman and her
22-year-old daughter were found in their home in Ayacucho. Police
said the two women had been shot to death.
   Other rebels Thursday stopped two men in a truck as they were
driving to a government irrigation project in Huanta, 200 miles
southeast of Lim, according to police. The passenger, an employee
at the project, was ordered by the rebels to lie on the ground. He
was then shot in the head, police said.
   The driver told police the rebels did not kill him because he
told them he was not associated with the government project.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its armed insurgency
against Peru's elected governments in 1980. The government says
more than 17,500 people have died in the violence.

Corruption Trial</HEAD>

   A former Danbury mayor accused of
extorting more than $100,000 from developers while in office was
found innocent Friday of all charges in his federal corruption
trial except a single count of tax fraud.
   James E. Dyer broke into a slight smile as U.S. District Judge
Jose Cabranes repeated the words ``not guilty'' six times before
reading the jury's guilty verdict on the final of seven counts.
   Dyer had been charged with one count of racketeering, two counts
of extortion and four counts of filing false federal tax returns.
He was the first elected official in Connecticut ever charged under
the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act.
   ``All I can say for now is I'm relieved,'' Dyer said after the
verdicts were returned. He called the verdicts an ``absolutely,
unmitigated victory.''
   Dyer thanked jurors as they filed out of the courtroom, then
hugged his wife, Alice, who wept as the verdicts were read. The
jury deliberated 2{ days before reaching a verdict.
   ``This is a case that was worth bringing,'' U.S. Attorney
Stanley A. Twardy said. ``It was a tough fight, it was a fair fight
and it's over.''
   Dyer, who is to be sentenced April 10, faces up to three years
in prison and a $250,000 fine for his conviction on a single count
of filing a false income tax return.
   He failed to list on his 1986 tax return a capital gain of
$10,000 from the sale of his condominium. After learning he was
under investigation, he filed an amended return and paid the $3,500
in taxes due.
   Dyer had faced 72 years in prison and $1.6 million in fines if
he had been convicted on all counts.
   His attorney, Hugh Keefe, said they hadn't decided whether to
appeal the single count, or discuss what sentence the government
will seek for Dyer.
   ``They just nicked Jimmy and they can't very well punish him for
something the jury didn't convict him of,'' Keefe said.
   The jury rejected the far more serious allegations that Dyer,
Danbury's Democratic mayor from 1979 through 1987, took nearly
$115,000 from developers to assure his support for their projects
in the city, and ran the mayor's office as a racketeering
enterprise during his last five years in office.
   Dyer called witnesses who testified that they paid him off ``a
load of liars.''
   ``The idea that I sat in my office and asked these guys for
money is ridiculous,'' Dyer said as waited for the verdict to come
in Friday morning.
   Twardy said Dyer would be barred from running for public office
again as a convicted felon.
   Dyer said his only immediate plans are to spend time with his
family and return to work as the marketing director at Applied Data
Inc. in North Haven.

   Peggy Say, whose brother Terry Anderson is
the Western hostage held longest in Lebanon, said Friday she will
meet with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in an effort to win his
release.
   She said she also hopes to see President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
the Soviet Union and Iranian leaders. Anderson and most of the 17
other Western captives in Lebanon are believed held by Shiite
Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   During a three-week tour of Europe and the Middle East, Mrs. Say
will confer with Pope John Paul II, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie and leaders of the Red Cross, human rights organizations and
other groups.
   On the eve of her fourth trip to the Middle East, she told a
news conference: ``I've come back empty-handed before and I fear I
may do so again.''
   Mrs. Say spoke to reporters after meeting with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar. She said she was convinced the United
Nations and President Bush were working for the release of her
brother, who is chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press and was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The Bush administration appears to care more about the hostages
than the Reagan administration, which she had criticized for
inaction, Mrs. Say told the news conference. She added that U.S.
``policy is dictated by the American people and, frankly, the
American people don't care about the hostages.''
   She and her husband, David, leave Saturday with an AP delegation
in hopes of gaining news of her brother, who is one of eight
Americans among the hostages.
   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., also will visit the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization's director, Federico Mayor, in
Paris and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria in Damascas.
She will meet Arafat in Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO has its
headquarters.
   She said she hoped to see Gorbachev and that better U.S.-Soviet
relations and the improved international climate are positive
factors for the hostages.
   ``This is a time of freedom around the world,'' she said. ``The
hostages have suffered enough.''
   Iranian officials have not responded to efforts to arrange a
meeting. Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual head of
Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite Moslem
kidnappers, refused to meet with the group outside Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say said a visit to Iran would be very important and
expressed hope that release of the hostages would be part of an
overall improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations.
   ``It is important for the sake of those hostages who died that
some good come out of it,'' she said.
   Asked whether she would be willing to visit Lebanon, she said
she ``never ruled out Lebanon, but I'm not going unless I am
assured that it would be part of bringing Terry out of there.''
   She said she would go if she were invited by those who hold her
brother and if they promised her security.
   ``I have a husband and children and grandchildren'' she said.
``It's got to be worth the risk. I am not foolish.''
   Besides Anderson, there are seven Americans among the 17
hostages.

<TEXT>
   Voters in this remote western Pacific
archipelago failed to approve a political arrangement that would
give it more self-government, its president officially told the
U.S. government Friday.
   A majority of voters supported the proposal but the island
chain's constitution requires a 75 percent majority.
   President Ngiratkel Etpison, in a letter written Friday to
Assistant U.S. Interior Secretary Stella G. Guerra, said he has
asked Palau's Congress for legislation to amend the constitution to
allow a Compact of Free Association to be approved by simple
majority of the voters.
   The 30-member Congress is expected to go into special session
late this month.
   The proposed compact, already U.S. law, provides for
self-government, more control over internal and foreign affairs,
and nearly $500 million in economic aid. It also would end Palau's
nearly 43 years as a U.N. strategic trusteeship under U.S.
authority. Ten other territories formed in 1947 under the
trustreeship system have achieved independence or self-government.
   
   The United States captured the islands in 1944 from Japan.
   With about 85 percent of the votes counted from a plebiscite
Tuesday, about 60 percent of Palau's voters supported the proposed
compact and its subsidiary agreements. The vote was 3,906 for the
agreements, 2,573 against.
   Counting of the remaining 1,164 ballots was to resume Saturday
morning.
   It was the seventh attempt in seven years to obtain the 75
percent margin.
   Opponents of the pact complained their land could be used by the
United States for military purposes or they wouldn't receive
adequate compensation for their land.
   Some opposition was based on anti-nuclear sentiment, although
the United States has said it won't store, test or dispose of
nuclear or other unconventional weapons in the islands. The compact
would allow nuclear-capable ships and aircraft to use Palau waters
and airspace.
   The cluster of 200 islands 600 miles east of the Philippines and
4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii has an estimated 15,000 people
residing on eight of the volcanic islands. An estimated 5,000 to
7,000 Palauans live overseas.

   Protesters targeting the majority white
school board and alleged police brutality promised to continue
their occupation of Selma High School and City Hall for a second
night Friday.
   Also Friday, city officials said an investigation of the alleged
brutality had cleared an officer accused of using excessive force
when he arrested a black protest leader.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman released a preliminary report into the
claim that Officer Ronnie Rushing abused protest leader Rose
Sanders when she was arrested Monday and carried from the mayor's
office.
   City Attorney Henry Pitts, who announced the findings of the
city's investigation, said: ``There is no evidence to support any
allegation of physical or sexual abuse.''
   Mrs. Sanders, who charged into the mayor's private office as a
melee erupted in an outer room, claimed the policeman touched her
``private parts'' with his nightstick and dragged her to police
headquarters with her jogging pants around her knees.
   According to the city's report, Rushing twice asked Mrs. Sanders
to leave the police car when they arrived at jail, but she refused.
The officer then put his baton between her handcuffs and pulled her
from the car.
   During the walk to the jail Mrs. Sanders went limp, and Rushing
and another officer had to drag her to an elevator, the report said.
   ``From the time she was first arrested, she was uncooperative
and refused to obey his orders,'' the report said.
   Although the city's probe cleared the officer of wrongdoing,
Rushing was placed on administrative duty Friday until the FBI,
Justice Department and Alabama Bureau of Investigation complete
their investigations.
   Blacks staged all-night sleep-ins at City Hall and Selma High
School awaiting the report. At the high school, where about 150
students, former students and adults spent Thursday night in the
cafeteria, doors were locked Friday morning, but police did not try
to enter.
   Students said they discussed black history and watched films,
including ``The Color Purple.''
   Later Friday, six parents and about two dozen students briefly
occupied city school board offices in a building one block from
City Hall.
   They left without incident after chanting ``No contract, no
school'' _ a reference to protesters' calls for the white majority
school board to extend the contract of Superintendent Norward
Roussell beyond June, when it expires.
   Roussell is the first black school superintendent in Selma. The
board voted in December against extending his contract, setting off
weeks of protests and periodic school boycotts.
   His supporters contend the majority white board refused to
extend his contract because he is black and because he lessened the
impact of a ``tracking system'' that allegedly tended to separate
blacks from whites on the basis of classroom levels of achievement.
   White board members, who removed Roussell from office last week
but reinstated him Tuesday as racial tensions forced the closing of
two schools, have cited a critical evaluation of Roussell's
managerial skills in his $80,000-a-year post.
   All 11 public schools in the 70 percent black, 6,000-student
system have been closed since Wednesday because of what school
officials call the threat of violence. The schools are scheduled to
reopen Monday.
   Besides protesting Roussell's treatment, black protest leaders
have called for a change in the way the school board is formed. The
board, with six whites and five blacks, is appointed by the City
Council, which has five whites and four blacks.
   The protest broadened to include the treatment of Mrs. Sanders
after she and four others were arrested on misdemeanor charges
Monday. But she said the protest's focus should not be on her but
on what she called a racially unfair educational system.
   Her husband, state Sen. Hank Sanders said the main issue is not
that schoolchildren are missing three days in class. At stake, he
said, ``is the quality of education for the future.''
   Ozell Sutton, regional director for the Justice Department's
community relations service division, said he arrived for meetings
with both sides.
   ``Everybody is receptive,'' he said. ``The problem is everybody
wants the situation resolved in their favor.''

   A judge cleared the way Friday for Joseph
Hazelwood's lawyers to blame U.S. Coast Guard negligence rather
than the skipper for the nation's larget oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone said he had decided to allow
cross-examination of two Coast Guard traffic monitors on the role
the agency's Vessel Traffic System played in the March 24 grounding
of the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez.
   After brief legal arguments, he allowed for the monitors to be
questioned about how closely they were watching radar and whether
they had a duty to notify Hazelwood that his ship was approaching
rocky Bligh Reef.
   However, Johnstone refused for now to admit in evidence a blood
alcohol test given to one of the monitors 13-15 hours after the
disaster at sea.
   The test showed that Bruce Blandford had a blood alcohol reading
of .203, more than twice the legal limit for driving in Alaska.
Blandford has said he had four drinks of bourbon and water when he
returned home after the accident.
   Johnstone said he would reconsider his ruling if Hazelwood's
lawyer, Dick Madson, can prove relevance. Madson said he planned to
call experts to say that a few drinks after work could not have
produced such a high blood alcohol reading in Blandford. He
maintains the monitor was drinking while on duty.
   On Thursday, Johnstone refused to admit the results of a urine
test showing that the second monitor, Gregory Taylor, tested
positive for marijuana three days after the accident.
   Also Friday the Alaska Supreme Court rejected Hazelwood's
request for a hearing on whether he was immune from prosecution.
The former skipper had claimed he was the first to report the spill
and that state and federal law grants immunity from prosecution to
those who make such reports.
   Most of the testimony in the trial's first week has focused on
liquor. The prosecution maintains that Hazelwood spent the hours
before his ship set sail drinking vodka with his shipmates and was
drunk when the Exxon Valdez ran aground just after midnight.
   The tanker spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope
crude, blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline, killing thousands
of animals and hundreds of thousands of birds. Exxon says it has
spent some $2 billion trying to clean up the mess.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating
a vessel while intoxicated.
   The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years,
three months in prison, and $61,000 in fines.
   Testimony was to resume Monday with Taylor and Blandford
scheduled as witnesses.

<TEXT>
   Workers blotted up gooey blobs
from along miles of beaches and boats skimmed oil offshore Friday
as the slick from a punctured tanker drifted off the scenic coast.
   The spill of up to 300,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil from the
tanker American Trader sent globules and a sheen ashore Thursday
night at spots along several miles of beaches south of Los Angeles.
   Newport Beach, five miles down the coast from Huntington, got a
brown tide of quarter-size globs and that city declared a state of
emergency.
   The 811-foot tanker carried 21 million gallons when its
single-wall hull was punctured, apparently by an anchor, as it
approached an oil pipeline mooring about 1{ miles offshore
Wednesday night.
   Several hundred workers hired by the oil shipper and volunteers
worked around the clock to soak up the goo at Newport. They had
filled some 800 large trash bags with towels, sand and oil by
Friday morning.
   Sixteen-year-old Lisa Virak skipped school Friday and came to
the beach with a roll of paper towels and a pair of rubber gloves.
   ``I came because it's part of our community. You've got to keep
the beach clean. The newspaper says it will take two years, but I
don't think it'll take that long with everyone's help,'' she said.
   Newport Beach city officials were pleased by the effort, said
city fire Capt. Ray Pendleton. ``The impact has been less than we
thought,'' he said.
   ``Are we out of the woods? No, not yet,'' said Charles Webster,
crisis manager for British Petroleum America Inc., which owns the
oil and chartered the tanker. ``But we're working to stay ahead of
the curve.''
   Booms had been placed across the entrances to the Bolsa Chica
Wetlands, the Santa Ana River and upper Newport Bay, and there were
no reports of oil reaching those wildlife habitats.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. William Kime said the soiled shoreline
measured 1{ miles at Huntington and three-quarters of a mile at
Newport. The slick stretched 5 miles by 7 miles from Bolsa Chica
State Beach to Newport Beach.
   There was concern the slick might drift south to Laguna Beach, a
scenic art colony fronted by rocky tide pools. Webster said a
cleanup firm was on call there.
   The cleanup bill ``has already reached the millions of
dollars,'' Kime told a news conference in Huntington Beach. He
noted that results of federally mandated drug and alcohol tests of
the ship's officers were negative.
   Cleanup costs were to be borne by the ship's owner, American
Trading Transportation Co. Inc. of New York, Webster said. British
Petroleum said it had 390 cleanup workers along a 20-mile stretch
of coast from Bolsa Chica to Laguna Beach. Eight skimmers were at
work and five more were due by day's end. Four others were en route.
   Skimmers had collected 16,800 gallons of oil by 7 a.m. Friday,
Kime said.
   The tanker remained off Huntington Beach as the Coast Guard
pumped remaining oil and water out of the forward hold which may
have been gashed by its anchor as it was mooring at an offshore
pipeline. Ships unload their cargo into the pipeline for transport
to an inland oil refinery.
   ``It looks like the vessel rode up over its anchor and punctured
itself,'' Kime said.
   The 1 million gallons of oil left in the forward compartment was
being pumped onto a barge. The ship has stopped leaking, the Coast
Guard said.
   Since the spill began, 49 oil-soaked sea birds have been brought
to a wildlife aid station for cleaning, said California Department
of Fish and Game biologist John Grant. Twelve died.
   Except for the change in wind direction that pushed tentacles of
the slick ashore, sea and weather conditions were favorable.
Federal and local authorities noted their luck but remained
cautious.
   ``To date we've been lucky,'' said John Turner, director of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``There's a lot of oil that could
come ashore.''
   The spill is tiny in comparison to that unleashed when the
tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound
last year, spewing more than 10 million gallons. The Alaska spill
had more than 30 times the amount of oil as the current California
spill.
   Turner said the state Department of Fish and Game director had
decided against using chemical dispersants on the slick and he
concurred.
   ``The proximity to the shore was a key in the decision here,''
he said.
   The potential toxic affects of the chemicals on animals was also
considered along with the fact that chemicals and a dispersal plane
could not have reached the scene for 36 hours, Turner said. By then
the spill was too broken up for chemicals to be effective, he said.
   Fish and Wildlife experts also went out in a boat to try to
determine the extent of harm to the environment.
   Huntington Beach is a city of 180,000 about 35 miles southeast
of Los Angeles. Newport Beach, about five miles down the coast, has
about 70,000 residents.

   Former President Reagan on Friday agreed to
answer questions about his role in the Iran-Contra affair in
videotaped testimony for the upcomig trial of John Poindexter.
   Reagan said he will respond to questions from Poindexter, but
said he or the Bush administration could invoke executive privilege
to avoid answering specific questions during the deposition.
   The ex-president proposed in a court filing that he give the
videotaped deposition in Los Angeles Feb. 16, four days before the
scheduled start of Poindexter's criminal trial.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene scheduled a hearing for
Monday to consider the timing and circumstances of the videotaped
deposition.
   On Monday, Poindexter was given approval by a federal judge to
ask Reagan 154 questions about the Iran-Contra affair. Greene gave
Reagan until Friday to decide whether he would invoke a blanket
claim of executive privilege in an attempt to avoid giving the
deposition altogether.
   Reagan ``recognizes that this court has a considerable
responsibility to protect and preserve the rights of the defendant
in this case as well as to be sensitive to the interests of the
former president and the constitutional rights and duties of the
presidency,'' Reagan's lawyers said in court papers.
   They said Reagan recognizes that the ``videotape deposition
format will provide an appropriate mechanism ... to protect
sensitive, classified national security information and
confidential deliberations.''
   Greene said Monday that Poindexter would be permitted to ask
follow-up questions in addition to the 154 main questions. The
subject areas include Reagan's knowledge of Oliver North's
activities and whether Reagan authorized written responses to
Congress for which Poindexter now faces felony charges.
   In a separate filing, the Bush administration said it would also
waive executive privilege to allow the former president to give the
deposition.
   But Bush administration reserved the right to invoke the
privilege to prevent Reagan from answering follow-up questions
during the deposition that might involve the ``foreign policy
deliberations within the president's office.''
   Specificially, the Bush administration expressed concern about
``questions that seek to delve into the nature of various
communications between former President Reagan and foreign heads of
state, which are, to our knowledge, still undisclosed and
sensitive.''
   But in the filing, the Justice Department said it did not find
``serious problems'' with the 154 questions for Reagan that have
been approved by the judge.
   Giving testimony by videotape away from public view will provide
an opportunity to stop the questioning if it impinges on sensitive
national security or diplomatic matters.
   Greene will attend the deposition and rule on disputes.
   ``The former president will defer to the incumbent president
with respect to issues of executive privilege that may arise during
the ... deposition,'' said Reagan's lawyers.
   Reagan could still invoke executive privilege with regard to
specific questions if his lawyers deemed it appropriate, possibly
terminating the deposition and triggering a protracted legal battle
in the courts.
   Assuming the deposition is completed, the edited videotape would
be shown at Poindexter's trial.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements, charges that
carry a maximum of 25 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines
upon conviction. Poindexter asserts that Reagan approved of
activities that led to criminal charges against his former national
security adviser.
   On Monday, Reagan invoked executive privilege in an attempt to
avoid turning over to Poindexter approximately 33 presidential
diary entries. That claim is being reviewed by Greene, who is
presiding in Poindexter's case.
   Greene wanted the question of Reagan's testimony resolved before
the trial, saying it would be difficult, if not impossible, for
Poindexter to formulate a coherent strategy without knowing in
advance whether the former president will answer questions.
   The ex-president would be asked about his knowledge of the
relationship between North and specific individuals in both the
Iran arms sales and secret assistance to the Contras.
   Reagan told the Tower Board on Jan. 26, 1987, that he did not
know the staff of the National Security Council, where North
worked, was helping the Contras. The board said it was aware of no
evidence to suggest that the president was aware of North's
activities.
   Reagan also would be asked whether he approved responses to
Congress inquiring into whether North was assisting the Contras.
   In the responses, Poindexter endorsed letters sent to Congress a
year earlier by national security adviser Robert McFarlane,
Poindexter's predecessor, denying that North was raising money or
providing military advice to the Contras. McFarlane in 1988 pleaded
guilty to withholding information from Congress in connection with
the letters.
   One question Reagan would be asked:
   ``Did you advise Admiral Poindexter to inform the congressional
committees that the information sought ... had already been
provided to them and that this information made it clear that the
actions of the NSC staff were in compliance with the law?''
   Reagan also would be asked about discussions with Poindexter
regarding a chronology on the Iran arms sales that is involved in
four of the five criminal charges against Poindexter.
   The chronology, prepared by others at Poindexter's direction,
falsely states that no one in the U.S. government knew until
January 1986 that a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment from Iran
to Israel contained Hawk missiles.
   President Ford gave a videotaped deposition in the criminal
trial of Lynette Fromme in the assassination attempt on Ford.
President Carter provided a videotaped deposition in the criminal
trial of a state senator and a sheriff on gambling conspiracy
charges. Carter, while in office, also gave videotaped testimony
for a grand jury investigation of an alleged White House attempt to
quash extradition proceedings against an international fugitive.

   A granddaughter of the late President Dwight D.
Eisenhower married one of the Soviet Union's top space scientists
on Friday in a ceremony at the U.S. ambassador's residence in
Moscow.
   Susan Eisenhower, 38, wed Roald Sagdeev, 57, former head of the
Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Sagdeev
also is a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet
parliament.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, described the wedding of two
celebrities in Moscow as ``a sensation.''
   The wedding was closed to news media, but people at the ceremony
said it was attended by Elena Bonner, widow of Soviet human rights
champion Andrei D. Sakharov, and by many Soviet parliamentarians.
   After the ceremony, the bride, in a white suit with gold trim,
and the groom, in a double-breasted blue suit, cut into a
three-tier wedding cake.
   Sagdeev, a physicist, was a close associate of Sakharov and is
considered a political reformer. He is well-known in the Soviet
Union. Before reforms took hold in the country, his institute was
considered top secret.
   The couple met at the annual Soviet-American Chautauqua
conference in the United States in 1987, and later encountered each
other at international conferences.
   The romance intensified while they collaborated on a book about
``survival, how a very thin layer of intellectuals survived through
difficult years, through purges'' before Gorbachev came to power in
March 1985, Sagdeev said last month.
   Tass quoted the couple as saying they did not expect quick
approval from authorities for their wedding plans, but that
approval was soon coming, ``a fresh indication that times are
changing for the better.''
   The bride is the daughter of John Eisenhower, the president's
son. She has her own consulting firm. She was married twice before
and has three school-age children. Her brother, David, is married
to the former Julie Nixon.
   Sagdeev said he has two grown children.
   The couple plan to maintain two homes, living in Washington to
be with her children during the fall and spring, and spend summers
in Moscow.

   Singer LaToya Jackson's
Valentine's Day concert in Kuala Lumpur has been canceled by the
Culture and Tourism Ministry.
   Culture Department Secretary Mukhtar Abdullah told reporters
Friday her presence would be ``against the values and norms of the
Malaysian culture.''
   Ms. Jackson, sister of superstar Michael Jackson, had been
scheduled to give free concerts at the Putra World Trade Center
Feb. 14 as part of Valentine's Day celebrations sponsored by a
tobacco company.
   Mukhtar said Ms. Jackson, who posed nude for Playboy magazine
last year, did not meet some of the conditions imposed by the
government on foreign artists performing in Malaysia. He did not
say what these conditions were.
   ``I am very disappointed and was really looking forward to
meeting my wonderful fans in Malaysia and warming their hearts on
Valentine's Day,'' Ms. Jackson said late Friday. ``I guess this
means I will cancel my order for candies for members of the
government.''
   Ms. Jackson is in London as part of a two-week European tour
that will take her to West Germany and Italy.
   An application for her Malaysian concert made by Genesis
Promotions, promoters for the performance, was only received by the
ministry on Jan 30, Mukhtar said.
   He expressed surprise that Genesis went ahead with promotion of
the concert through newspapers and television without first getting
permission from the ministry.
   Mukhtar denied the cancellation had anything to do with pressure
from opponents of the concert.
   In recent months, extremist Moslem student groups have
demonstrated outside Western musical shows here.

<HEAD>Mulroney Comment Sends Canadian Dollar Plunging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian dollar went into a tailspin Friday
after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said interest rates will likely
fall when a federal budget aimed at reducing the deficit is
released this month.
   The drop forced the Bank of Canada to jump into the market,
where it bought unwanted dollars and forced rates higher to defend
the currency.
   ``After the next budget (on Feb. 20), you will begin to see the
downward trend of interest rates ... by year's end,'' Mulroney said
in an interview with The Canadian Press.
   The currency began falling minutes after Mulroney's remark was
reported. It closed at 83.21 U.S. cents, a drop of more than half a
penny from Thursday's close and nearly three-quarters of a cent
down from its Friday high.
   Mulroney later stood by his comment.
   ``I believe the policies taken by (Finance Minister Michael)
Wilson will have the general effect of lowering interest rates. I
believe those policies will increase Canada's competitiveness and
enhance our economy.''
   Like the U.S. government, Canada is wrestling with a large
budget deficit, which can drive up interest rates when money is
borrowed to finance it.
   In the year ending March 31, Canada ran a deficit of $30.5
billion Canadian on a budget of $143 billion Canadian in a country
of 25 million people.
   The Canadian dollar has been under siege since last month when
the Bank of Canada reversed its long-standing policy and eased
interest rates. The move triggered a run on the dollar and the
market has been jittery ever since.
   On Thursday, the Bank of Canada boosted its bellwether bank rate
to 12.79 percent _ the highest level in 5{ years _ in a bid to stop
the continued sell-off of Canadian dollars. It marked the third
week of rate increases, which influence the level of broader
consumer and business loan rates.

<HEAD>Boston Attorney Says He Has New Evidence In MacDonald Murder Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer said Friday he has new evidence to file
for a retrial in the case of Jeffrey MacDonald, a former Army
doctor found guilty in 1979 of murdering his pregnant wife and two
children.
   ``This time we've got it nailed cold,'' said Harvey Silverglate,
who was acquainted with MacDonald while both were students at
Princeton University some years ago.
   Silverglate, who hasn't previously represented MacDonald,
refused to disclose the nature of the evidence but said it was
startling.
   ``Some of it is newly discovered, some of it is known to the
prosecution and was suppressed at the time of the trial,''
Silverglate said. ``We have the heart of the evidence but we are
still pursuing a few strings and ... are in the process of pulling
it all together.''
   The attorney said he planned to file a retrial motion in the
spring, at which time the new evidence would be made public.
   A book about the case, ``Fatal Vision,'' was written by Joe
McGinnis and later made into a television movie.
   MacDonald, a former physician and Green Beret, was convicted of
fatally stabbing and bludgeoning his 26-year-old wife and daughters
while he was stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C. in 1970. He has
contended his family was victimized by a band of drug-crazed
hippies.
   His conviction was reversed in 1980 by a Richmond, Va.-based
appeals court on grounds he was denied a speedy trial. But the U.S.
Supreme Court subsequently overturned that ruling.
   In 1985, a federal court denied MacDonald's request for a
retrial, but Silverglate said this time ``it was a different
story.''

<DATELINE>GREELEY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sign said ``No Ingles, No Travato'' _
a mangled attempt at the Spanish for ``No English, No Work.''
   But even if it had been spelled right _ ``No Ingles, No
Trabajo'' _ the placard posted outside a construction site near
Greeley probably would have been illegal, state and federal
officials say.
   Jorge Amaya, state director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said he confronted the construction foreman at
the Sand Livestock Systems construction trailer Thursday after he
spotted the sign.
   ``That sign was telling a whole group of people to get lost, and
that's discrimination,'' he said.
   ``It's exactly the kind of thing we feared when the official
English amendment passed (in a 1988 referendum). I'll tell you, if
we put up a sign saying `no more white people' we'd get nailed in
seconds.''
   The posting marks the latest shot fired in the battle over
``Official English'' statutes, which have been enacted in dozens of
states in the past few years. They are intended to discourage
bilingual education and other concessions to non-English-speaking
immigrants.
   On Tuesday, a federal judge in Phoenix tossed out Arizona's
Official English law, saying it violated the right to free speech.
That law required state and county governments in Arizona to
conduct most of their business in English only.
   Colorado's constitutional amendment is less specific _ it simply
declares English to be the official state language, without
describing what that means.
   To officials at a hog farm under construction for National Farms
in Kersey, about 10 miles east of Greeley in north-central
Colorado, the amendment meant that Spanish-speakers could be
discouraged from applying for work.
   ``We had some pretty poor communications around here,'' said
project superintendant Al Benson. ``We were getting so many people
who couldn't speak English. For example, I have a cement finisher I
can't even talk to.''
   The sign was posted last summer, Benson said. He insisted that
it was legal.
   ``We checked,'' he said. ``Because of the English-only bill we
know it's legal.''
   But state and federal officials disagreed.
   Ed Gibbs, regional officer for the Colorado Civil Rights
Commission in Greeley, said the sign was ``definitely illegal.''
   No one had filed a complaint with his office, but Gibbs said he
would investigate the incident and the company could be ordered to
pay damages to anyone who could prove they were discriminated
against because of the sign.
   Joe Esquibel of the U.S. Labor Department said the sign is
``probably illegal'' because the construction business isn't one
that requires English to be spoken.
   Another Labor Department official, Loren Gilbert, said that
unless English is an occupational qualification _ as, for example,
for a disc jockey _ it is illegal to refuse to hire people because
they don't speak the language.
   ``You can't tell me that English is a requirement for digging
post holes,'' he said.
   Amaya of the League of United Latin American Citizens said he
intends to file complaints with the Labor Department and the state
civil rights commission.
   The local manager for National Farms, Bill O'Hare, said he had
been unaware of the subcontractor's sign. He said National Farms
allows ``all people to apply for jobs and we do not discriminate in
any manner.''

   Cuomo had promised several weeks ago to file the suit after

   Cuomo said the federal law's requirement ``that we take
ownership of waste that is produced by others is an unprecedented
intrusion that irreparably damages the essential level of state

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces Brilliant Pebbles Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first flight test of the so-called
``Brilliant Pebbles'' system under the Strategic Defense Initiative
is scheduled for this summer, the Pentagon announced on Friday.
   The Defense Department has ruled that the test ``complies with
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972,'' which bans
anti-missile weapons in orbit, SDI officials announced.
   President Bush touted the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' concept earlier
this week when he visited a major Star Wars research laboratory in
California.
   In his latest budget, Bush has asked for $4.5 billion for the
so-called Star Wars space-based anti-missile shield in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, nearly a $1 billion more in the current
fiscal year.
   Congress cut $1 billion from Bush's $4.8 billion Star Wars
request for this year.
   The ``Brilliant Pebbles'' idea envisions deploying thousands of
tiny maneuverable satellites, packed with sensors to detect enemy
missiles, in low-earth orbit, where they could ram and destroy the
missiles if commanded to do so.
   At a briefing and in documents handed to reporters, SDI
officials said the cost of putting a ``Brilliant Pebbles'' system
in space under the Strategic Defense Initiative has been cut by
some 20 percent because of technological advances.
   ``Technological progress and an evolving architecture for the
space-based portion of Phase I now permit projected cost figures
near $55 billion,'' expressed in dollars of 1988 buying power, the
SDI office said.
   In June 1988, officials estimated the cost of a Phase I missile
defense to be $115 billion, but that estimate was reduced to $69
billion in October of 1988.
   The new, lower estimate appears to be due to the shifting of
emphasis to the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' sypstem, and because the
advances allow scientists to make smaller, less expensive devices,
the documents indicated.

   Three people were killed and 19
injured when two blasts rocked a carbide factory early Friday about
100 miles southwest of Berlin, police said.
   The blasts _ eight minutes apart _ occurred at the Schkopau
chemical plant 7 miles south of Halle, said a police spokesman in
Halle. About 15,000 people are employed at the factory.
   Cause of the accident, in the heart of East Germany's chemical
industry, was not immediately clear.
   Police spokesman Volker Grasser said three people died in the
accident at the VEB Chemische Werke Buna in Schkopau and 19 were
injured, some of them seriously.
   ``There was a horrible blast. Suddenly everything around us was

   Authorities cordoned off the Richland
County Courthouse Friday after the sheriff exchanged himself for a
hostage held by twin robbery suspects.
   Sheriff's officer Gregory Kemp said Sheriff Dale Shetler had
exchanged himself for Deputy Deb Strine, who had been taken hostage
by the 18-year-old brothers.
   The brothers, who were believed to be armed, had not made any
demands, and hostage negotiators were on the scene, Kemp said. He
described the situation as ``a stalemate.''
   The brothers had been arrested for robberies in north-central
and northeastern Ohio.
   Ms. Strine was released about 6:20 p.m. Shetler 43, has been
sheriff since August 1987, and been with the sheriff's department
since 1977.
   Police on Jan. 31 arrested twins Brad and Chad Jordan in
connection with a string of armed robberies in Mansfield, Canton
and Bellville.
   Their mother, Sandra Peters, and brother, Kenneth, were on the
scene Friday night, the Mansfield News Journal reported.
   The Jordans were arrested after a clerk at a Bellville
convenience store triggered a silent alarm. Authorities arrested
one brother in the parking lot of a nearby bank, while the other
surrendered from a relative's home.
   Fire and emergency medical units were on the scene or on
standby, authorities said.

<HEAD>In Plea Agreement, Young &amp; Rubicam is Fined in Jamaica Tourism
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. advertising
agency pleaded guilty Friday to making improper payments to a
Jamaican businessman in its efforts to win the Jamaican government
tourism account.
   In a plea agreement, the government dropped racketeering and
bribery charges against the New York-based agency and two of its
executives.
   The company was fined $500,000 for conspiring to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying $130,000 to Arnold Foote
Jr., while ``having reason to know'' that Foote might offer bribes
to Eric Anthony Abrahams, the former minister of tourism in
Jamaica, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy.
   The company had faced fines of up to $7.5 million on the bribery
and racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey also placed the company on
probation for two years and said he would consider ordering the
agency to perform community service.
   Young &amp; Rubicam said Friday that ``some of its employees did on
occasions hear reports of alleged bribery efforts,'' but that the
company still has no reason to believe that Foote ever bribed
Abrahams.
   Further, the company said, the government now agrees that Young
&amp; Rubicam won the Jamaica account fairly.
   The agency pointed out that the ``reason to know'' section of
the Corrupt Practices Act was considered controversial and was
removed by Congress in 1988.
   ``Ironically, if the case were brought today, there would have
been no such charge,'' the company said.
   The government alleged in an indictment last year that Young &amp;
Rubicam made the payments of $900,000 to win and retain the
lucrative Jamaican tourism account, for which it produced the
award-winning ``Come Back to Jamaica'' campaign in the early 1980s.
   In the indictment, the government characterized Foote as an
adviser to Abrahams and thus a public official as defined under the
Corrupt Practices Act.
   Until Friday, the agency denied any wrongdoing, maintaining it
hired Foote to help with the account and that he was not a public
official.
   Federal prosecutors, citing ``exculpatory evidence recently
turned over to the government,'' dropped charges against two Young
&amp; Rubicam executives who faced racketeering charges: Executive Vice
President Arthur R. Klein and former account supervisor Thomas
Spangenberg.
   A third Young &amp; Rubicam employee, Steven M. McKenna, faces
federal perjury charges. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 26.
   Foote and Abrahams have also been charged, but they remain in
Jamaica. Twardy said he has been advised by the Justice Department
that he cannot extradite Foote and Abrahams on racketeering charges
under current Jamaican law.
   The settlement came the day after jury selection began in
federal court in the trial of the agency.

   West German opposition politicians said
Friday their government has information that Libya's controversial
Rabta chemical plant has begun producing poison gas.
   A government spokesman in Bonn, when asked about the
allegations, said: ``We cannot take a position at this time.''
   Reinhard Kraemer, a spokesman for the environmentalist Greens
party in Bonn, said the Greens have received information that the
plant has produced enough poison gas for 1,000 artillery shells.
   A U.S. official in Washington said Friday that the Libyans have
been producing ``very small'' amounts of chemicals, possibly for
weapons use, for about a year.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plant
60 miles south of Tripoli is producing nowhere near its design
capacity and that the United States is monitoring the situation,
but that nothing has occurred the past year to raise further alarms.
   The Libyan government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi has denied the
Rabta plant was designed to produce poison gas, saying it instead
is for the production of pharmaceuticals.
   Ali Sunni Muntasser, Libya's deputy representative to the United
Nations, said Friday night, ``All these stories about manufacturing
gases or chemicals or anything is untrue.''
   Albrecht Mueller, a federal lawmaker with the main opposition
Social Democratic Party, said he was told by a West German
government official the Rabta plant is making poison gas.
   He said the information was released during a meeting Wednesday
of the parliamentary Economics Committee.
   ``I gathered from the meeting the production started last
year,'' Mueller told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   He said an Economics Ministry official identified the chemical
name as ``Lost,'' which is a military term for
dichlordiaethylsulphide, a poison gas that renders opponents unable
to fight when it comes into contact with the skin.
   Mueller said he had heard from other sources that the Rabta
plant has produced more than 20 tons of the poison gas since last
year. He would not identify the other sources.
   Kraemer, the Greens spokesman, said: ``We have information that
the Libyan chemical plant in Rabta has produced large amounts of
`Lost' gas, enough to arm 1,000 shells.''
   Kraemer said he could not be more specific on where the party
had obtained the information.
   Other sources in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the matter came up at closed-door meetings of the parliamentary
Foreign Committee as well as the Economics Committee.
   The Rabta plant caused a huge scandal for West Germany last year
with U.S. allegations that West German firms helped build the plant.
   West Germany at first denied the U.S. allegations, but
ultimately launched its own investigation and accused the
Imhausen-Chemie firm of helping build the Libyan plant.
   The investigation has not yet been concluded.
   Mueller said he did not recall the name of the Economics
Ministry official who released the information.
   He said members of the committee were ``deeply disturbed'' when
they heard the allegations.
   Mueller said he did not know where the Economics Ministry
official got the information, but that he assumed it came from
intelligence sources.
   ``This was a very embarrassing affair from the state, and
continues to be one,'' said Mueller.

   Ronald Reagan said Friday he is optimistic about
the state of world affairs and praised Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev as the Soviet Union's ``best and only hope.''
   ``I am more optimistic than ever in my life about world peace
and democracy,'' the former president told 1,000 Days Inns hotel
franchisers at a convention. ``These are the days of triumph and
freedom.''
   Reagan, 79, said the only trouble spot is the Middle East.
Alluding to biblical passages about the end of the world, he said,
``It's important to remember that the battle of Armageddon was to
begin in an area in Israel, according to the prophecy.
   ``The problem there is they have leaders like (Moammar)
Gadhafi,'' he said. ``It was not just an accident that some
airplanes flew his way one day,'' he said referring to the 1986
bombing raid on Tripoli, Libya.
   Reagan also praised Gorbachev for reforms in the Soviet Union, a
country Reagan once referred to as ``the evil empire.''
   ``He is totally different than any Soviet leader before him,''
Reagan said. ``The only threat against him is from within.''
   Reagan also praised President Bush for leaving most Reagan
administration programs largely intact.
   ``He came into continue what's been on going for eight years,''
Reagan said of Bush.
   Reagan, who spoke for 25 minutes and answered questions for 30
minutes, received an estimated $60,000.
   Former First Lady Nancy Reagan also was in Atlanta and toured a
special care nursery for ``crack'' babies at Grady Memorial
Hospital.

<HEAD>Golden Crown Restored to Poland's National Emblem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Friday restored a golden
crown to Poland's national emblem, the eagle, recreating the prewar
symbol of independence after a debate so emotional one member
suggested former Communists had no right to vote.
   Deputies elected as members of the now-dissolved Communist Party
started to walk out in protest, and a hasty recess was called
before Parliament voted overwhelmingly to go back to the national
symbol used from 1927 until the Nazi occupation in 1939.
   The white eagle with a golden crown, beak and talons, its wings
outspread and turned to the right on a red shield-shaped
background, will replace the uncrowned white eagle that decorated
government offices and official documents during 45 years of
Communist rule after World War II.
   ``It was with this eagle that we lost our independence, first
under Western (Nazi German) and then under Eastern (Soviet)
force,'' said Piotr Nowina-Konopka, a minister of state to
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who proposed the new symbol.
   ``Despite that, it survived in Polish homes and families, as
well as among Poles abroad, as a symbolic sign awaiting better
times ahead.''
   The postwar Communist government rejected the crowned eagle as a
symbol of Poland' monarchial past.
   Poles began agitating for restoration of the crown almost as
soon as the Solidarity-led government replaced the Communists in
September.
   Parliament voted 316-3 with 52 abstentions Friday to return the
crown, reshape stars on the eagle to avoid any resemblence to
Soviet red stars, and remove a border around the shield that was
the heraldic symbol of illegitimacy.
   Documents, currency and other uses of the old emblem will be
valid until the end of 1995, although official signs must be
changed by Dec. 31, 1992.
   The debate Friday was whether the eagle's crown should have a
cross, too.
   When Poland was restored as an independent nation following
World War I, the eagle's crown included a small cross. This was
removed in 1927, reflecting the nation's religious diversity.
   But Poland is more than 90 percent Roman Catholic now, following
the obliteration of the Jewish population during World War II and
the annexation by the Soviet Union of Polish lands home to its
Ukrainian and Byelorussion minorities.
   The cross was rejected, however, and Solidarity Deputy Jan
Lopuszanski then rose to address the 173 parliament members elected
to seats guaranteed last year to the Communist Party.
   ``I have a moral appeal to the left side of the hall, I think
that this voting should take place without you. I think you would
be right to abstain from voting on this issue,'' he said.
   Amid murmurings, about a dozen ex-communist deputies rose to
leave.
   Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz immediately called a recess of
the lower house to avert a walkout. Later, a deputy said the
Solidarity caucus rejected Lopuszanski's view.

<HEAD>Top Colleges Still Cater to an Elite, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at the nation's top colleges now
are more likely to be from upper middle-class families than from
old money, according to a study released Friday.
   The new elite is defined more by intellectual achievement than
family tradition, but is an exclusive one nonetheless, two
sociology professors say in their study of the freshman class that
enrolled in 1986.
   ``It's not the old gentry any more,'' said Professor Lionel S.
Lewis of the State University of New York at Buffalo. ``They've
incorporated the upper middle class and professional class.''
   Lewis and his co-author, Paul William Kingston of the University
of Virginia, compared freshmen entering all colleges and
universities that year to those who enrolled in the 76 most
selective schools, as defined by the American Council on Education.
Those are schools where the freshman class averaged at least 1,175
of a possible 1,600 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   ``That would be the Ivy League schools and the prestigious
colleges _ Oberlin, Swarthmore, Haverford, places like that,''
Lewis said.
   More than 60 percent of the freshmen at the selective schools
came from families with income of at least $50,000 a year, compared
with 31 percent overall. Nearly 25 percent of the freshmen at
selective schools came from families with incomes of $100,000 or
more, compared with 7 percent overall.
   The freshmen admitted to those schools are unquestionably chosen
for their academic merit and extracurricular achievements, rather
than family wealth or connections, but merit is measured on a
yardstick that favors the affluent, Lewis and Kingston said in an
article in the journal Academe.
   ``Most students who are meritorious in the conventional sense
come from high-income families where they have enjoyed special
opportunities; children from lower-income families acquire
relatively fewer linguistic and cultural skills,'' the professors
wrote.
   ``The `all-around' person is an upper-class value, and the
dominance of this value in the admissions process has made it
possible for elite private institutions to tighten their academic
requirements for admission and still cater to the privileged.''
   Many of the top schools say their admissions policies are
``need-blind'' and promise to give all students as much financial
aid as they need, but Lewis said those policies aren't designed to
attract students from lower-income backgrounds.
   ``The first part of financial aid is always a student loan. Then
they give work-study. Then, after that, they might give some kind
of a grant,'' Lewis said in an interview. ``If you accept any form
of student aid, you're going to have to borrow, and some people
choose not to do that.''
   He said an increase in merit-based scholarships might be part of
the solution, but other issues would remain, such as the
possibility that poorer students might feel uncomfortable at those
schools or that the SAT and other admissions criteria discriminate
against the poor and minorities.
   ``I don't have a pat and easy answer,'' he said. ``The problem
is the problem of inequality in our society.''

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court on Friday upheld the
murder conviction of a Taiwanese gangster for the 1984 slaying of a
Chinese-American journalist who had written critically of Taiwan's
government.
   Tung Kuei-Sen, 37, admitted taking part in the shooting death of
Henry Liu and said he did it out of patriotism after being told Liu
was a traitor.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal said Tung's motives weren't the
equivalent of ``heat of passion,'' which makes an intentional
killing manslaughter rather than murder. The 3-0 ruling upheld
Tun's sentence of 27 years to life in prison.
   Liu, 52, a Taiwanese-born U.S. citizen and author of a critical
biography of Taiwan President Chiang Ching-Kuo, was shot to death
in October 1984 at his home in Daly City, south of San Francisco,
by gunmen who were later traced to the United Bamboo Gang in Taiwan.
   Military courts in Taiwan convicted five men of responsibility
for the murder, including the nation's defense intelligence chief,
Vice Admiral Wong Hsi-Lin, who was found to have ordered the
gangsters to silence Liu. Wong was sentenced to life in prison.
   In December the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a
civil suit that the government of Taiwan was legally responsible
for Wong's actions. The suit was filed by Helen Liu, the
journalist's widow.

<TEXT>
   An official said on
Friday that a Chinese smuggler paid a U.S. immigration agent up to
$1 million to allow more than 200 Chinese emigrants into the United
States by way of the Virgin Islands.
   At a detention hearing, Magistrate Jeffrey Resnick ordered
jailed without bail inspector Juanito Creque of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service; Leonard Y. Hu, the alleged smuggler, and
five illegal immigrants.
   Creque and Hu are charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal
aliens across a U.S. border. Hu is charged with bribery and Creque
with accepting a payoff.
   U.S. Attorney Terry Halpern said in asking for their detention,
``They are international travelers with connections in many foreign
points along the route used to bring Red Chinese from mainland
China to St. Croix and St. Thomas.''
   Customs agent Ramon Davila, who posed undercover as a
co-conspirator during the investigation, said in an affidavit that
the aliens traveled to the Virgin Islands by way of Hong Kong,
London and the West Indies island of Antigua.
   Davila said Hu paid Creque $5,000 each _ or up to $1 million _
for more than 200 illegal Chinese immigrants Creque allowed to
enter the Caribbean territory and continue on to the the mainland
United States last year.
   Davila said Hu paid him $15,000 in bribes to allow five Chinese
safe passage to the United States in November.
   He said in the affidavit that Hu and the five aliens were kept
under surveillance and traced to a restaurant on Mott Street, in
New York City's Chinatown district.
   Hu, Creque and six others were arrested this week at St. Thomas
airport as the aliens were trying to travel to New York.
   The six others _ Antiguans Everton Coates and his wife
Millentine, and Chinese Tong Xiang Yang, Zhou Tu Ni, Jufoi Wu and
Dian Min Zheng _ were charged with conspiracy and entry without
inspection.
   According to Davila's affidavit, Coates was the Antiguan contact
and his wife coordinated the alien shipment and was in
communication with Creque.
   Mrs. Coates was released on $35,000 property bond. All the other
remained in jail. A trial date has not been set.

   Twenty-two soldiers who fought in Panama

   ``The United States Army has never stood taller than it has

   ``You had some of our toughest fighting. You heard the whine of
richochets, and you perservered. There is no one in the world who

   The medals included two Silver Stars, the third-highest award
for bravery.
   One Silver Star went posthumously to Cpl. Ivan D. Perez, who was
killed in the Dec. 20 assault on La Commandancia, headquarters for
Gen. Manuel Noriega and the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The other went to Spec. Roderick B. Ringstaff, a medic who
ignored his own wounds to give aid to fallen comrades during the
attack.
   Six soldiers were presented the Bronze Star with valor, and 14
received the Army Commendation Medal with valor.

   Cigarette vending machines will be banned
from gas stations, some restaurants and other areas open to the
public in a measure intended to curb sales of cigarettes to minors.
   The City Council first considered banning cigarette vending
machines from all places open to the public, but that effort
failed. The revised measure, passed unanimously, includes three
exceptions to the ban.
   The machines will be allowed in factories and workplaces, in
restaurants with liquor licenses and in hotels.
   But machines at the hotels and sanctioned restaurants must be in
view of a clerk, according to the ordinance. And in the case of
hotels, the machines must be equipped with remote-control shut-off
systems.
   Minneapolis joins four other Minnesota communities that have
banned or restricted unsupervised cigarette vending machines.
   In Indiana Friday, a similar measure, which would have ordered
removal of cigarette vending machines from family restaurants,
shopping malls and other places accessible to children, failed to
clear a state Senate committee.

   President Vaclav Havel will visit Canada this
month for two days prior to his trip to the United States,
Czechoslovak officials said Friday.
   Embassy spokesman Juraj Kosmel said Havel, 54, is to come to
Ottawa on Feb. 18 and will travel to Toronto on Feb. 19 before
going on to Washington and New York.
   Kosmel said Havel was invited by the Canadian government and
will likely meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and External
Affairs Minister Joe Clark in Ottawa.
   His tentative plans include an official lunch and dinner and a
meeting with Ontario Premier David Peterson.
   Local Czechoslovaks, meanwhile, said Havel is to speak at the
University of Toronto on Feb. 19.
   Jan Merta, president of the Ottawa chapter of the
Czechoslovakian Association of Canada, said there will likely be a
welcoming event in Ottawa, home to about 1,200 Czechoslovaks.
   Havel, a playwright and longtime civil rights activist, was
jailed about five years by the former Communist regime for his
dissident activities, on charges of ``attempted subversion.''
   When he became president in December, he was the first
non-Communist head of state in Czechoslovakia in 41 years.
   Merta said the visit is cause for great excitement. ``For us,
it's the same as the way Catholics look up to the Pope.''

<HEAD>Relations Strained Over PLO Failure to Condemn Tour Bus Attack</HEAD>

   The PLO came under fire Friday in a
government newspaper editorial for failing to condemn a terrorist
attack on a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Egypt that left nine
dead.
   Sources close to the government say relations have chilled with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which could endanger efforts
by the United States to initiate Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
because Egypt is acting as surrogate for the PLO in the process.
   In a related development, one of the Israeli survivors has given
a authorities a videotape he took of last Sunday's attack, which
may help track down the assailants, newspaper reports said.
   Ibrahim Nafei, editor of the leading government-owned newspaper
Al-Ahram, said in an editorial Friday that a PLO statement on the
attack was ``flimsy and weak, to say the least. It is not at all
commensurate with the magnitude and monstrosity of this (bus)
incident.''
   He said he was ``reluctant to say the statement conflicts with
the PLO's renunciation of terrorist acts.''
   In the ambush, two masked gunmen killed nine Israelis and
wounded 20 with hand grenades and automatic weapons fire on a
desert road between Cairo and the Suez Canal. An Egyptian tour
guide also was wounded.
   The sources said Egyptian-PLO relations have deteriorated so far
that the estimated 35,000-40,000 Palestinians in Egypt have come
under government scrutiny. They said breaches of travel and
residence rules have been uncovered in the checks that followed
strong hints of a Palestinian connection in the bus incident.
   It was the worst chill since President Hosni Mubarak shut down
seven PLO offices in Egypt for seven months in 1987. The closure
was to protest criticism by the Palestine National Council, the
organization's parliament in exile, of Egypt's 1979 peace treaty
with Israel.
   Egypt resents a statement issued Monday from PLO headquarters in
the Tunisian capital Tunis that failed to condemn the bus attack.
It appeared to equate the killing of Israelis on the bus with the
killing by Israelis of Palestinians in the 2-year-old uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   Faisal Husseni, a leading pro-PLO activist in the territories,
had condemned the attack, saying such violence ``comes from groups
who are fed by the stubbon Israeli position'' in the peace process.
   
   The statement by the PLO, distributed by the organization's news
agency Wafa, also obliquely criticized Egypt's peace with Israel
and U.S. disregard of the PLO in Washington-led peace efforts.
   On Thursday, Mubarak sent a message to PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat, which the sources said was believed to have conveyed
Cairo's displeasure over the organization's position.
   The PLO's Cairo representative, Saeed Kamal, said he relayed
Mubarak's ``verbal message'' to Arafat by telephone. Neither he nor
Egyptian officials would discuss its contents.
   About 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been detained for
questioning in the attack, including the bus driver and the man who
rented the Peugoet, according to a police source.
   In an interview published Saturday in the Cairo newspaper
Al-Gomhouria, Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa said a videotape
shot by Pinchas First, one of the Israeli survivors, recorded the
voice and faces of the attackers.
   ``I used my camera right from the start of the attack, and I'm
sure that I managed to film the assailants,'' First said in an
interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot.

   Turkey asked the International Labor Organization
on Friday to help it improve mine safety following an explosion and
fire at a coal pit two days ago in which 66 miners were believed
killed.
   An ILO spokesman said West German mine expert Meinhart
Funkemayer will prepare a report on safety situation within the
Turkish mining industry.
   The ILO then expects to offer Turkey consulting services on how
to improve mine safety, based on Funkemayer's recommendations.
   Funkemayer already is at the disaster site at Merzifon in
northern Turkey, sent by West Germany to help extinguish the fire,
ILO spokesman Peter Sutcliffe said.
   Of 68 people in the mine when the explosion occurred Wednesday
night, two were rescued alive. Eight bodies were recovered and 58
others are believed entombed in the mine.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reported
progress toward agreements cutting long range nuclear warheads,
troops in Europe and chemical weapons in marathon talks Friday with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials.
   The Soviet president urged Bush to modify his new proposal for
troop reductions in Europe to eliminate a 30,000-soldier advantage
for the United States, and Baker labeled the counterproposal ``very
interesting.''
   Baker said he and the Soviets made headway on a number of other
fronts _ and clashed over Cuba _ in negotiations designed to pave
the way for a summit next summer between Gorbachev and President
Bush.
   ``If you ask me if I am pleased at what we are able to do here,
I am very pleased,'' Baker said at a midnight news conference after
long sessions with Gorbachev and then with Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   He said the talks made headway ``very very smartly'' toward a
treaty on long-range missiles.
   The two sides also prepared to announce on Saturday Soviet
approval of a U.S.-proposed phased plan for the abolition of
chemical weapons.
   The two superpowers _ the only nations to acknowledge possesion
of chemical weapons _ already have agreed in principle on the deep
cuts outlined by Bush at a United Nations speech last September.
   Bush proposed that both countries cut their arsenals of chemical
weapons to 20 percent of the current U.S. inventory while a
40-nation treaty is worked out requiring U.S. and Soviet cuts to 2
percent of the current U.S. level in eight years. That 2 percent
would be destroyed within 10 years if all countries capable of
building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   Bush, in his State of the Union address, called for troop limits
of 195,000 each for the United States and the Soviet Union on the
``central front'' _ for the United States, basically West Germany _
with the United States allowed to retain 30,000 soldiers elsewhere
on the continent.
   Gorbachev proposed applying the 195,000 limit to all of Europe,
thus cutting the U.S. advantage.
   Alternatively, Gorbachev proposed a ceiling of 225,000
throughout Europe. Since most Soviet troops are in Central Europe
the total there could be boosted to 225,000.
   Baker said the idea of a 195,000 limit for all of Europe was
``very close to the president's proposal,'' but he said he would
consult the U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
before responding formally.
   He is to meet with the 15 foreign ministers at a conference in
Ottawa, Canada, next Monday and Tuesday. Officials from the seven
Warsaw Pact nations will be on hand as well to consider ``open
skies'' and other measures designed to reduce East-West tensions.
   While virtually all Soviet soldiers on the continent are
stationed in the central region of Poland, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the United States has forces in
Britain, Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey.
   Baker said the Soviets ``don't want to deal with Central Europe
as such.'' And, he said, ``the United States obviously is not
wedded to the concept of linkage.''
   Baker winds up his visit here on Saturday with an unprecedented
appearance before the International Affairs Committee of the
Supreme Soviet _ the Soviet parliament.
   He will then fly to Sofia, Bulgaria, and on Sunday to Bucharest,
Romania. The two East European allies of Moscow are in the midst of
rocky transitions from hard-line communism.
   Baker will meet with opposition leaders as well as government
officials in those countries, the State Department said.
   While the issue of troops drew most of the attention, Baker and
the Soviets made headway on a number of other fronts _ and clashed
over Cuba.
   Baker confirmed reports the Soviets are in the process of
providing MiG fighter-bombers to Cuba, but evidently was unable to
persuade the Soviets to relent.
   On Afghanistan, he said the United States was willing to permit
President Najib to remain in office while peace negotiations are
conducted between the Soviet-backed government and U.S.-armed
guerrillas.
   But Baker said Najib would have to step down once an agreement
was reached to end the 11-year war in the Southwest Asian country.
   On another regional front, Baker criticized Israel for settling
some Soviet Jewish immigrants on the West Bank and in Gaza. He said
the settlements were an obstacle to peace.
   However, Baker said that since Israel is ``a strong ally'' of
the United States he had rejected a Soviet proposal to join in
condemning the settlement of the Jewish refugees. They amount to
about 1 percent to 2 percent of the Jewish exodus to Israel from
the Soviet Union.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said Thursday night the two sides were likely to adopt such a
public stance together.
   On several arms control fronts Baker also reported progress.
   He said the issues of revealing missile test data in flight to
the other side and where to store non-deployed missiles were
settled. And, Baker said, a third complex issue _ how many
air-launched cruise missiles could be carried on bombers _ was
settled except for questions about their range.
   These were the three complex issues Bush and Gorbachev, at their
Malta summit meeting in December, had turned over to Baker and
Shevardnadze for resolution.
   They are part of the negotiations on a treaty to slash
long-range U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines
that Bush and Gorbachev would like to sign at their summit meeting
in Washington in June.
   An even more ticklish issues _ what to do about sea-launched
cruise missiles _ apparently will be finessed with a statement
outside the treaty itself stating each side's policy.
   Baker said he did not think the declaratory statement would be
submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification along with the treaty.
   What to do about the missiles, which are carried on submarines
and surface ships, has been the most difficult problem in the
treaty's path.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Gorbachev told Baker that new
U.S. proposals ``make it possible to bring the positions closer on
several items and inspire hope that the program of preparations for
the summit in Washington will be successfully implemented.''

<HEAD>Blacks Move Into City Hall In Protest Over Alleged Abuse Of Leader</HEAD>

   Public schools, closed three days by protests
over white management of the city's mostly black school system,
will reopen Monday, officials said Thursday.
   The demonstrations continued in this 1960s battleground of the
civil rights movement, as about 250 people crowded into City Hall
to protest the alleged sexual abuse of a protest leader when she
was arrested earlier in the week.
   The protesers promised to stay in City Hall until the police
officer involved is suspended. About 45 people remained there
Thursday night as City Council members met to seek a resolution of
the situation.
   School officials announced that all 11 public schools would
remain closed Friday. Schools Superintendent Norward Roussell said
later that the schools would reopen Monday.
   Rising racial tensions forced the closing of two schools Tuesday
morning. All schools in the 70 percent black, 6,000 student system
closed that afternoon, and remained shut Wednesday and Thursday.
   The six white members on the 11-member board dismissed Roussell
last week, but reinstatated him Tuesday, and he returned to work
Wednesday.
   White board members voted in December against renewing his
$80,000-a-year contract it expires in June, prompting the five
blacks on the board to announce their resignations.
   Roussell and his supporters claim the board was terminating his
contact because he is black, rather than because of his alleged
lack of managerial skills as claimed by his critics.
   The latest protests were over the arrest Monday of Rose Sanders
in a melee at City Hall.
   Mrs. Sanders claims a policeman touched her private parts with
his billy club as she was dragged to police headquarters. She was
released from the hospital Thursday.
   The wife of state Sen. Hank Sanders, who was hospitalized Monday
with injuries she said she received at the hands of police, was
released from the hospital Thursday.
   Sanders and a law partner of his met Thursday with Mayor Joe
Smitherman, who said the matter was under investigation and a
report is expected Friday.
   Smitherman said the policeman, Ronnie Rushing, has been given
office duty. The mayor said earlier that Rushing was injured by
Mrs. Sanders when she forced police to remove her from City Hall.
   ``He said Rose bit him and he had to have medical treatment,''
Smitherman said. ``I don't believe it at all when she said she was
mistreated.''
   ``I know Rose Sanders would not say anything if it did not
happen,'' said one of the protesters, the Rev. L.L. Ruffin. ``Nor
do I believe she instigated it.''

<HEAD>Eric Bogosian's `Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

   Subway panhandlers. Aging rock stars.
Blue-collar punks. Rappers. Ruthless lawyers. Self-satisfied
doctors. Street crazies. Drug heads.
   Eric Bogosian hears America singing and the song is one of
excess _ and how people handle it.
   His blistering portraits come to life in ``Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp;
Roll,'' a terrific collection of monologues that Bogosian unleashed
Thursday at off-Broadway's Orpheum Theater.
   The dark, frizzy-haired performer has done one-man shows before,
specifically ``Funhouse'' and ``Drinking in America,'' but in his
latest effort Bogosian captures even more successfully the
schizophrenic nature of his characters' lives.
   Nightmarish and comic at the same time, they sum up the late,
not-so-lamented 1980s as the decade of greed and preoccupation with
self.
   Even Bogosian's bums have an ego. ``I'm a product of my
environment,'' snarls an aggressive subway beggar. ``I want your
money.''
   Some of the material is savagely funny, particularly a geriatric
pop idol who, now that he has made his dough, has discovered the
evils of dope, the risks of sex and the plight of the Amazon rain
forest.
   Or there's Bogosian's almost slapstick picture of a lower-class
Italian kid who takes a good friend out on a bender the night
before his wedding _ an escapade that results in the trashing of a
McDonald's and a postponement of the ceremony.
   There's a chilling effect to the evening too, especially in the
final, almost scary monologue where a stoned young man talks about
computers taking over the world. These machines are going to get
you one way or another, he warns. And you believe him, no matter
how high he is.
   A tough social critic, Bogosian has a kind of weird affection
for these misfits. He understands them.
   Bogosian also has become a better actor since his last New York
appearance. For example, director Jo Bonney has coaxed out of him
an acerbic portrayal of a nasty, combative lawyer who is as
hilarious as he is frightening. The man keeps repeating ``sue me''
so often that it begins to sound like a religious chant.
   A lot of Bogosian's monologues have a rhythm, an almost musical
quality to them. The language flows, whether it is street talk or
high-finance legalese.
   Bogosian is a physical as well as verbal performer. He paces and
prowls the small, spare stage. In his swagger, struts, shuffles and
pacings you get a sense of the fierce energy these characters
invest in pursuing both pleasure and pain.
   The evening goes on a little too long and might work better if
there were an intermission. ``Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll'' is such a
densely packed work that by the time it's over, the audience is
exhausted _ from both laughing at, and worrying about, the
memorable people Bogosian has put on stage.

   A judge said he may reverse himself and permit
Joseph Hazelwood's defense to allege that government negligence _
not recklessness by the Exxon Valdez captain _ caused the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone reopened the question after
he had ruled Thursday that such a theory could not be advanced by
the defense.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson said in his opening statement that
the U.S. Coast Guard monitors weren't watching their radar screen
and failed in their duty to notify Hazelwood that his 987-foot
tanker was heading for disaster at Bligh Reef.
   A Coast Guard traffic monitor, civilian employee Gregory Taylor,
testified Thursday that part of his job was to watch the radar
screen for trouble and communicate with tankers if a problem was
imminent. He also said he was to ``let people know what was going
on to make things easier.''

   U.S. and Latin officials are close to
agreement on a communique for next week's drug summit pledging U.S.
help to revamp the drug-dependent economies of Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia, sources say.
   The communique to be signed at the four-nation meeting also
would commit President Bush to press other Western nations to
provide economic aid to the Andean nations, said a South American
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The document is being prepared for the signature of Bush and the
presidents of the three Andean countries who will meet Feb. 15 for
a drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
   U.S. military assistance to the Andean countries is not spelled
out in the document, but the Latins have insisted it be restricted
to equipment and training rather than direct U.S. military
involvement in interdiction, said the South American diplomat.

   AIDS spread at its slowest rate in the United
States last year as fewer homosexual and bisexual men developed the
disease and drugs delayed symptoms in people already infected,
federal officials said.
   But AIDS is spreading faster among heterosexuals, newborn
babies, women and Southerners, the federal Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The CDC reported 35,238 new cases of AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, in 1989, compared with 32,196 in 1988.
   That 9 percent increase is easily the slowest since the AIDS
spread began in early 1981. For example, AIDS was up 34 percent in
1988 and 60 percentn 1987.

men, according to a study published today.
   The gene, called thegene, or RB, was found in earlier studies to
block the formation of a rare cancer of the eye.
   In a Sciencee study published today, scientists at the
University of California-San Diego say they have shown that a

<HEAD>Norwegians Convinced They Are Overrun by Thugs and Hooligans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminologists and other experts tell them
otherwise, but many Norwegians are convinced their country is
overrun by thugs, hooligans and ``the mob.''
   The experts say the public concern verges on ``national
hysteria.'' They argue that Norway still has one of the world's
lowest crime rates, and is nowhere near being in a league with the
United States or other countries with serious crime problems.
   ``Our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel
about it,'' said Nils Christie, a University of Oslo criminology
professor.
   Muggings are rare and city parks generally are safe. Some
cafeterias leave it up to the customers to leave what they owe in a
till and even make their own change.
   Few of Norway's 4.2 million people have actually witnessed
criminal violence, according to an informal poll by one newspaper.
   Police, who usually are unarmed, used or threatened to use
weapons just 28 times last year, according to Justice Ministry
figures.
   ``Norway is at the bottom of the list of violent crimes per
capita,'' said Christie. The risk of being murdered in the United
States is nine times greater than in Norway, according to a local
study.
   Sociologist Cecilie Hoigaard listed Norway's murder rate in 1988
as 0.9 killings per 100,000 residents, compared to 1.4 in Sweden
and 5.1 in France. The World Almanac said the U.S. figure was 8.3
the same year.
   Yet crime in Norway has increased by about 15 percent a year
since 1986, according to official figures, and that's what has
brought all the repercussions.
   ``We aren't interested in comparing ourselves to other
countries,'' said Tor Aksel Busch, deputy director general of
public prosecutions. ``We must compare ourselves to the way things
were. It is the increase that is disturbing.''
   Crimes for monetary or material gain, such as theft and fraud,
represent 81 percent of the offenses.
   ``There is simply much more to steal because Norway's standard
of living has increased enormously,'' criminologist Christie said.
Norway had an economic boom when it discovered oil off its coast.
   From 1986 to 1988, drug arrests doubled and violent crime rose
29 percent, partly because alcohol is more accepted by
``traditionally reserved and pious Norwegians,'' Christie said.
   ``We Norwegians are very worried about crime,'' said Kjell Solem
of the Justice Ministry. ``It is a frequent topic of debate. We
started with very little and don't like the increase,''
   ``Norway has an old-fashioned crime rate,'' he added. ``You have
to go back 25 years to find such a low rate in Sweden. It is safe
almost anywhere, any time in Norway.''
   In December, robbers rammed a large truck into an armored car
and escaped with about $1 million, leaving a trail of burning
getaway cars. Norwegians could perhaps understand the greed but
were appalled that the thieves were prepared to harm the security
guards by ramming the armored car with the truck.
   ``People speak of moral decay, the fraying of society's
fabric,'' Solem said.
   Crime was a major issue in last autumn's national election;
everything from drugs and alcohol to video tapes and foreigners
came in for the blame. The right-wing Party of Progress increased
its standing in Parliament tenfold, partly on the basis of a
law-and-order campaign.
   ``Crime has become a matter of national hysterics,'' said
sociologist Thomas Mathiesen. ``There is a much greater fear of
crime than there is any grounds for.''
   Many Norwegians are responding by fortifying their homes. Lock
sales soared 60 percent from 1987 to 1989 and burglar alarm sales
are said to be on the rise.
   Mathiesen said fear was being spread unwittingly by the news
media, politicians and even police who seek larger budgets.
   Tabloid newspapers routinely brand any group of criminals ``the
Mafia.'' They devote sensational and lengthy coverage to murders
and pursue the cases for weeks.
   The respected Aftenposten newspaper, in a review of the 1980s,
said more crime produced more crime reporting. In the 1970s,
``trivial crimes were reported,'' it wrote. ``Now it's hard to find
space for all the corruption, theft and violence.''

<HEAD>Radio Free Europe Still Has Job to Do in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An original goal of Radio Free
Europe, born in the Cold War to penetrate the Iron Curtain, was to
close when Eastern Europe opened up and the news flowed freely. But
the Western network is staying on the air with a new mission _ to
spread word on how democracy works.
   ``Yes, we are going to stay in business,'' said William W.
Marsh, executive vice president of Radio Free Europe and its sister
station Radio Liberty, which broadcasts into the Soviet Union.
``Our job is not done.''
   Radio Free Europe, founded in 1949 and Radio Liberty,
established two years later, are based in Munich but controlled by
the Washington-based Bureau of International Broadcasting and
funded by the U.S. Congress. It is popularly known as RFE-RL.
   RFE-RL was distinct from the Voice of America, the British
Broadcasting Corp. and other Western radios, because it was ``a
surrogate for free media that did not exist'' in Eastern Europe,
said Robert E. Gillette, the deputy director.
   RFE broadcasts to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and
Romania, as well as the Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Radio
Liberty broadcasts to the Soviet Union in 12 languages.
   Gillette and A. Ross Johnson, a director, say they believe RFE
was a powerful catalyst in the revolutions that have swept Eastern
Europe.
   It not only broadcast international news but news from inside
the countries to which it beamed its programs _ people got news of
home from abroad.
   But now, after the revolutions, RFE-RL is hearing increasingly
from people who ask for practical advice on democracy and the
free-market economy, the radio's officials say.
   Setting an example of Western journalistic ethics is another
role RFE sees as vital in the establishment of democracy in Eastern
Europe.
   ``It won't be a short or easy process to have a pluralistic
media,'' Johnson said. ``It is relatively easy to close down the
censor's office and get the Communist Party out of the media, but
it is not so easy to change a generation of habits.''
   ``The best way to teach Western journalistic ethics is by
example, but it will take some years,'' said Gillette, a former
correspondent for The Los Angeles Times.
   But the broader role is to answer the countless questions people
have about democracy and Western economics.
   ``They don't know much about democratic institutions, how to go
about establishing them,'' Marsh said. ``They are trying to learn
about the democratic process.''
   ``We get specific requests on the practice of democracy,''
Johnson said.
   People want to know how parliaments and courts work in the West,
how political parties are financed, what entrepreneurs do, even how
to clean up the environment.
   ``We are trying to provide that kind of practical information,''
Johnson said. ``In a sense, lessons in democracy.''
   What happens when that job is done?
   ``In an ideal world if there were no need for us, we would be
very happy to close our doors,'' Marsh said. ``But that doesn't
exist yet.''
   Said Gillette: ``History has been on fast-forward, but that
doesn't mean there can't be a reversal. There are lots of
alternatives to democracy. It's not done yet.''

   ``Mountain Stage,'' Appalachia's radio
answer to ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' is hitting its stride as a
showcase for new and avant-garde folk, blues, bluegrass, country
and even rock music.
   ``Now we're to the point in the world of music that a lot of
people know about us. I don't think we're in our prime yet,'' said
Larry Groce, host and co-producer.
   The two-hour weekly show, broadcast on nearly 150 American
Public Radio stations, brings eager artists before appreciative
crowds in a historic downtown theater every Sunday afternoon.
Between them stand live microphones.
   ``There's a lot of uncertainty in this thing,'' Groce said.
``Every show is like writing a song. It's not art without
uncertainty.''
   Co-producer Andy Ridenour saw a dearth of live radio shows when
he created ``Mountain Stage'' for West Virginia Public Radio in
1981.
   ``The idea is not a novel one,'' he said. ``The contemporary
presentation is unique. There's no one else doing what we're
doing.''
   ``Mountain Stage'' went into regular production in 1984 and was
first distributed nationally by National Public Radio in 1986. The
show switched to APR last October. It is often compared to ``A
Prairie Home Companion,'' Garrison Keillor's celebrated live public
radio variety show.
   ``Mountain Stage'' producers say they admire Keillor's show, but
emphasize they didn't jump on the Minnesota show's bandwagon. For
one thing, they say, ``Mountain Stage'' emphasizes music over talk
and moves quickly between acts.
   A typical show, broadcast live in West Virginia and rebroadcast
on a tape delay elsewhere, usually offers three acts and the
ever-present Groce, backed by the house band and ``The Fabulous
Twister Sisters.''
   Groce, 41, is a singer and songwriter from Dallas whose ``Junk
Food Junkie'' was a 1976 hit. His smooth tones and gentle manner
now probably come across best when he sings a traditional hymn on
every ``Mountain Stage.''
   The band, which includes Twister Sisters Deni Bonett and Julie
Adams on fiddle and guitar, is making its own name as Stark Raven.
   ``Mountain Stage'' often features regional acts from Texas and
Cajun country, and such international acts as Latin American,
African and Irish folk singers.
   Ridenour, 40, a former radio newsman, was not met with
enthusiasm when he created the show. Groce said even NPR
pooh-poohed the show.
   ``People spent a lot of time telling us what we couldn't do,''
Ridenour said. ``We were told ... the show would never work, that
we couldn't do a show like this in Charleston, W.Va. NPR said there
was a maximum of 60 stations that would ever use `Mountain Stage.'
''
   Funding for the show hasn't grown as rapidly as its popularity.
The producers manage up to 40 broadcasts on about $500,000 a year,
about one-third the amount similar radio shows receive. Ridenour
said the money buys a small staff and musicians, stipends for the
artists, rental of the auditorium and a little promotion.
   Stations now get the show through their APR fees, but West
Virginia Public Radio will be paid directly beginning in July,
Ridenour said.
   ``A la carte'' public radio is becoming a trend as funding
becomes more difficult and stations pick and choose which shows
they want, Groce said.
   ``The reality is that it costs money to make this programming,
and if you're going to take it, you're going to have to start
paying money,'' he said.
   ``Mountain Stage'' is fast becoming a key stop for rising
musicians as agents and record companies realize the show's
popularity. Artists, too, are enthusiastic and show their
appreciation by signing the walls in the basement of the Capitol
Plaza Music Hall downtown.
   ``I was West Virginia when West Virginia wasn't cool,'' wrote
country singer Kathy Mattea, a Charleston-area native who performed
in December after being named the Country Music Association's
Female Vocalist of the Year.
   Pop songwriter Livingston Taylor, younger brother of the singer
James Taylor, was recently greeted like an old friend. ``I've been
here lots of times,'' he said. ``They're a really comfortable crew
to work with.''
   Taylor's enthusiasm came through when he modified the final
stanza of ``You Are My Sunshine'' in the finale, singing, ``On
Super Sunday, I flew to Charleston, my loneliness to assuage. At
long last, I have contentment, with my `pards' on `Mountain Stage.'
''
   Robin Williams _ the traditional folk musician, not the comedian
_ said he's been on ``Mountain Stage'' four times to work with
``great musicians in a great atmosphere.'' He also likes the
exposure and the chance to do new songs instead of old hits.

   Eighteen years after it was made, ``A Clockwork
Orange'' still cannot be seen on British screens. But it is about
to find a new home on stage.
   Set in the next century and featuring music by members of the U2
rock band, the Royal Shakespeare Company's version extensively
reworks a script by Anthony Burgess, author of the 1962 novel.
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' remains best-known for Stanley Kubrick's
controversial 1971 film, starring Malcolm McDowell as the marauding
Alex, a 15-year-old Briton drunk on the joys of violence.
   The film was nominated for several top Academy Awards but was
also denounced for supposedly extending the frontiers of screen
violence. In 1972, Kubrick withdrew it from British circulation
because he was receiving death threats.
   Written in ``nadsat,'' an Anglo-Russian slang invented by
Burgess, the novel and film were about Alex's love of violence and
Beethoven, and the doctors who destroy both passions by meddling
with his brain.
   Burgess wrote the stage script simply to deter others from doing
it, but lately he has taken to deriding his most famous novel.
   ``It's a terrible book in some ways. I'm not prepared to defend
it,'' Burgess told the Independent newspaper.
   But the play's director, Ron Daniels, disagrees. He calls the
novel ``a brilliant piece of work,'' and he believes the stage show
will be ``complex and interesting and vivid and at times funny.''
   ``A Clockwork Orange: 2004,'' as the play-with-music is now
called, opened Feb. 6 at the RSC's Barbican Theater in London,
running in repertory through March 13.
   ``It's very much a morality play for the '90s,'' Daniels said
during a rare afternoon off from rehearsals, as many of his cast
are appearing in his concurrent RSC ``Hamlet.''
   ``Nowadays, after pictures of Vietnam, after punk, after video
nasties, after all those appalling images of violence, the way I
hope we will assess the novella will be not so much as a play about
violence, but as a play about right and wrong,'' he said.
   Alex, leader of the so-called ``droogs'' who get their kicks
beating and raping others, is ``the malefactor as hero, a
modern-day Richard III,'' Daniels said.
   ``It's amazing how attractive the character is,'' Daniels said.
``He's someone free from all sense of guilt. ... He says, `I'm
celebrating myself.'''
   The stage version restores the original ending of Burgess' novel
which was excised in both the American edition of the novel and in
Kubrick's film.
   ``What happens is Alex goes back into the wide world; now he's
18, but he's no longer enjoying the ultraviolence, no longer
enjoying the gang society,'' Daniels said.
   ``He's becoming a much more stable citizen, but at the same time
we miss his creative energy. He's the brightest and the best.''
   Burgess' script includes musical numbers to Beethoven melodies.
Phil Daniels, a 31-year-old Londoner and no relation of the
director, plays Alex. The show features some Beethoven, while
adding a contemporary sound provided by Bono and The Edge, two
members of U2.
   ``I phoned up their manager and said, `I'm going to be doing
this; would they be at all interested?''' Ron Daniels recalled.
``Ironically, they had just been in Los Angeles where they were
struck by the gang identity and violence.
   ``Had I wanted abrasive music, I would have gone to a hard rock
group. This music is immensely evocative and haunting; other
moments have a very here and now sound.''
   While ``A Clockwork Orange'' is not, Daniels emphasizes, a
musical, its choreography by Arlene Phillips (``Starlight
Express'') involves knives and chains, not high-stepping chorus
lines.
   ``The fact is we have a boy who is enjoying evil,'' he said.
   He added that the play has ``a moral and a social context. It's
about people who have no stake in society _ the discarded, the
marginals.''
   To those who wonder whether it's a suitable project for the
Royal Shakespeare Company, Daniels replies: ``This is precisely the
sort of front-line theater the RSC needs to be doing. ... It does
what I think theater must do: It disturbs, it unsettles, it makes
you think new thoughts.''

   Early in ``Black Stars in Orbit'' on PBS
tonight, a former Air Force pilot, nominated in 1963 to be the
first black astronaut, discusses what he says was the racial
prejudice that kept him from that achievement.
   President John F. Kennedy had prodded him to apply for the space
program, says Edward J. Dwight Jr., and there were rumors that ``he
had this dream of having a black or ... an Oriental'' on the
nation's first mission to the moon.
   Dwight never became an astronaut. The reason, he says _ his
bitterness muted but still there _ was racial prejudice,
particularly by a white senior officer at the Air Force test pilot
school to which Dwight had been assigned.
   You'll wish that this otherwise excellent ``Orbit'' had done
more in the segment _ had identified the officer Dwight doesn't
name and listened to his side of the story.
   It might have shown that even with Dwight's accusations of
bigotry, perhaps a bit more was involved. The program, produced by
filmmaker William Miles, should at least have raised more questions.
   But this one-hour documentary about America's black astronauts
and the blacks who worked behind the scenes in the nation's space
program, still is well worth viewing.
   It lets them tell of their dreams and the obstacles they faced
and amply shows their determination to succeed in what for years
had been an all-white, all-male preserve.
   The program profiles six black astronauts, including the late
Dr. Ronald E. McNair, one of the Challenger crew members killed
when the spacecraft exploded in January 1986.
   Others on the program include Dr. Mae C. Jemison, who will make
her first space flight next year, and Air Force Col. Guinon S.
Bluford, who in 1983 became the first black to travel in space.
   ``Orbit'' also shows, sparingly, the outright racism that
existed, the ugliest example a letter once sent the widow of Air
Force Maj. Robert H. Lawrence Jr., the first black pilot selected
for astronaut duty.
   Sympathy cards poured in, she says, after he was killed in the
mid-'60s when the ejection seat of his F-104 fighter malfunctioned
just before the plane crashed.
   But the mail also brought hate. One writer, she recalls, said he
was glad her husband was killed ``because now there would be no
coons on the moon.''
   In a long but interesting segment, actress Nichelle Nichols, Lt.
Uhura of ``Star Trek,'' speaks about how she agreed to use her TV
fame to help the nation's space program recruit minorities and
women.
   But perhaps the program's best moments come when individuals
simply are allowed to talk about what they do, or about their
experiences in space if they've been there, without a big deal
being made about what ``first'' they accomplished.
   It's good that viewers, particularly young ones, know what
blacks have faced in the space program, and prior to that _ such as
their struggle to fly combat missions in the racially segregated
military of World War II.
   But sometimes it's just as helpful to just listen to someone
like Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who flew the space shuttle
Columbia in 1986, talk about the space program or his memories of
McNair.
   He's articulate and obviously loves his work. He shows that
today's Right Stuff cadre has no color, only desire, courage,
education and ability.

<HEAD>Grocery Stores: Here Come The Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have seen how efficiently the Japanese
make and deliver cameras, television sets, electronic accessories
and automobiles.
   Soon they may witness that same efficiency in the grocery store.
Already the Japanese have perfected their techniques at home; now
they are preparing to move into the American market.
   ``Acquisition and aggressive market entry is only a matter of
time,'' says Bill Best of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm that has
just completed two studies of what is likely to become a
controversial situation.
   Already, says Best, who heads the company's Tokyo office, many
Japanese food companies have set up at least an outpost in the
United States, and he predicts the matter ``will become a major
issue in the next five years.''
   The battle could be bitter, and controversial too, because the
Japanese have developed advantages over American counterparts in
the efficiency of food delivery, a critical factor in the highly
competitive food business.
   Even now, competition for space in foodstores is intense. With
some outlets earning less than a penny a dollar, stores cannot
afford empty shelf space, and even brand-name products can be
removed because of tardy deliveries.
   In Japan, says Best, it takes Japanese food manufacturers less
than a day to deliver to their customers, while a similar study in
the United States showed food producers took 7.7 days from
processing to delivery.
   While travel time conceivably could be a factor in the Japanese
advantage, other factors seemingly play a far greater role. Among
them, Best cites three:
   1. Japanese manufacturers focus entirely on service,
coordinating closely with customers to meet their day-to-day needs.
   2. Point-of-sale data systems are much more accurate than U.S.
systems.
   3. The Japanese have more flexibile delivery conditions for
small lots, often using `window' distributors, or third-party
contractors, for actual delivery.
   While the Japanese view the American market as an opportunity,
domestic factors also influence their attitudes. Market growth in
Japan has slowed, says Best, because calorie intake has leveled off
and population growth is slow.
   While this situation has existed for a while, Japanese food
companies feared entering the U.S. market, says Best, because they
were unsure of ability to adapt to American tastes.
   He says that fear is receding, as Japanese companies acquire
interests in U.S. companies, such as Del Monte. Already active in
the United States are scores of brand-name firms, such as Nissin
(noodles), House (spices) Asahi (beer), Ajinomoto, the biggest food
company in Japan and Kikkoman (soy sauce).
   The efficiency of the Japanese could present a critical
challenge to American food manufacturers, especially if retailers
seek to lower inventories, historically a large expense, in favor
of just-in-time delivery.
   It wouldn't be a first. Accustomed to warehousing large
inventories of components, American automakers quickly shifted to
just-in-time deliveries when they discovered them to be a major
factor in Japanese price competition.
   Best lists these implications for the U.S. marketplace:
   1. American grocery products companies will need to respond to
customers with faster, more reliable service.
   2. Distribution strategy will become more important in customer
relations.
   3. Reliable, current market information _ data on sales and
inventories, for example _ will be essential to providing better
service with less inventory.

   Stocks of Wall Street's big brokerages are
dancing the limbo. The question is: How low can they go?
   Not much lower, say securities analysts, who think brokerage
stocks already may have bumped the bar with their bellies,
bottoming out after a pathetic showing in 1989.
   One sign of apathy was troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s
decision last month to scrap a sale of 20 million shares of common
stock. Shearson's own brokers were said to balk at selling the
issue.
   In a typically gloomy assessment, analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder
of Prudential Bache Securities Inc. said the securities business
remains sluggish and investors pessimistic about brokerage firms'
performance in 1990.
   Eckenfelder said it will take at least six to 12 months to
evaluate securities stock buys made at current depressed levels,
``because the market seems poised to take a wait-and-see attitude,
and earnings for the March quarter are not expected to improve
significantly.''
   While a revival isn't imminent, that doesn't mean stocks of
major firms will fall further. Shearson brokerage analyst Dean
Eberling said stocks of full-line investment firms fell 21 percent
in 1989, compared with a 10.6 percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index and 27 percent jump in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``This may mark the bottom of the cycle,'' Eberling said. ``I
can't say it's going to turn around tomorrow night,'' but
securities stocks may improve over the long term, he said.
   Just how long that term will be no one knows. Unless crucial
Wall Street businesses such as investment banking and retail
brokerage _ both in the doldrums _ pick up, the consensus is at
least a year.
   How bad has it been? Shares of Shearson, beset by internal
management turmoil, hit an all-time low of $10.12{ late last month,
down 44 percent from the start of 1989 and more than 70 percent
from its public offering in 1987.
   Stock in the nation's largest brokerage, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
has lost more than 25 percent in the last year. Salomon Inc. is off
about 20 percent, even though it reported a 1989 profit of $470
million, the best on Wall Street (though much of that came from the
firm's oil-refining and trading businesses).
   Wall Street firms have been grumpy since the October 1987 market
crash washed away the giddy prosperity of mega-mergers and buoyant
stock market activity.
   After tanking in the crash, brokerage stocks idled through 1988.
Individual investors cautiously returned to the market in mid-1989,
investment firms turned in strong second- and third-quarter profits
and their stocks responded.
   But hopes of a lasting revival were wiped out when the Dow
average plunged 190 points on Oct. 13. Brokerage commissions are
down and investment banking activity has all but dried up along
with the junk-bond financing market _ a double whammy for Wall
Street firms.
   ``Now we have a soft retail environment and a very weak
investment banking environment,'' Eberling said. ``Those two have
come together to create a very tough operating environment.''
   Not all firms have performed badly. Analysts recommend stocks
such as the St. Louis-based retail brokerage A.G. Edwards Inc.,
whose shares have risen since the start of 1989. Discount brokerage
Charles Schwab &amp; Co. has more than doubled in the same period.
Analysts point to low overhead and well-managed costs at those
firms.
   Of the large publicly traded firms, only Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. are getting high marks, for similar
reasons: specialization and controlled costs.
   Analysts laud Morgan's domestic and international investment
banking business. The company also is buying back its own stock _ a
good sign for investors, analysts said. Bear Stearns wins for
consistent earnings and a successful stock clearing-house operation.
   Regional brokerages could do better because of less
susceptibility to the junk-bond market mess that has crippled big
takeover deals, industry executives said.
   ``The middle-market deals, those of $250 million and less, are
continuing to get done because they are much less dependent on
public offerings of subordinated debt _ that is, on junk bonds,''
Lloyd Greif, vice chairman of the San Francisco-based investment
firm Sutro &amp; Co., said at a conference of regional brokerages
earlier this month.
   But securities industry analysts caution that investors
shouldn't expect instant profits from brokerage firms. Wall Street
is in a recession, and there are no indications it will end soon.
The message: Beware of bulls.
   ``The brokerage industry is characterized by its optimism and
enthusiasm,'' said analyst John Keefe of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. ``There's a tendency on the part of management to think the
next market turn is just around the corner.''

   A minor executive of an immensely powerful Japanese
bank invites you for a nightcap at ``his bar,'' where pretty young
women in leather miniskirts pour your whiskey.
   Three hours later the banker takes care of the $620 tab by
handing the cashier a business card. As you walk into the neon
glare of Tokyo's Ginza, you wonder how the home office will react
when you try to return the hospitality.
   Welcome to the moderate end of business entertainment in Japan.
   Dinner for four at a swank ``ryotei'' restaurant _ where geisha
entertain with mournful ballads and witty stories while diners
feast on prawns so fresh they wriggle on the plate _ can cost
$6,900.
   Yet many Japanese companies expect their executives to entertain
clients several nights a week at such restaurants and hostess bars.
   In 1989, the cost of entertaining climbed 8.7 percent to a
record $31 billion, says the National Tax Administration,
surpassing the $29 billion budgeted for Japan's defense.
   The rise occurred despite a call from the Keidanren, a leading
business group, for restraint in the aftermath of the notorious
Recruit affair, a scandal over alleged bribery of numerous
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   The money is spent not so much on closing deals as on building
close relationships.
   ``Without liquor Japanese can't be frank,'' said Kazutaka
Nakamura, an accountant who has crunched the numbers on expense
accounts. ``It's a national characteristic.''
   For small companies, entertainment expenses can make up 20
percent to 30 percent of project costs, he said.
   The practice can hobble a foreign enterprise in Japan.
   Robert J. Collins, president of the American Club in Japan and
author of the satiric novel ``Max Danger, The Adventures of an
Ex-Pat in Tokyo,'' cites golf as evidence.
   ``If a guy is really laying it on ... golf can easily run to
half a million yen ($3,500).''
   Laying it on may include sending a limousine or even a
helicopter for the guest and providing luxury accommodations by the
green, he said.
   Even a ``no-frills golf excursion during the weekdays'' costs
about $1,000, said Collins, who has been an insurance executive and
head hunter during his 12 years in Japan.
   Expense is not the only burden.
   With traffic jams snarling Tokyo highways every weekend, ``You
go out there the night before, stay up late drinking, get up at
dawn and go out in the rain and play all day long.
   ``Then you drive four hours back to Tokyo and never once has
anyone said a word about business.''
   Collins said the object is to endure an ordeal together.
   Afterwards, he said, ``I can get on the phone to a company
chairman and he'll come out of a meeting to talk to his golfing
buddy.''
   After-hours entertainment follows tediously predictable
patterns, Collins said: ``Mutual appreciation over dinner, then
some gossip. Then you move onto ... a hostess bar. There's a
`karaoke' (sing-along) machine and four or five girls.''
   For hours, ``You sing and drink. Names get shortened.''
   Finally, he said, ``You go home sick and show up the next day at
work complaining, `God, I had to stay out 'til three in the
morning.'''
   The effort can create ``a bond stronger than any contract,''
though a company may have to absorb losses for a few years in hopes
of long-term profits.
   Spending into the red on entertainment is hard to explain to
management or shareholders overseas, but it is a way to enter
Japan's tightly knit business circles and help find a market for an
import.
   As wives are never included in such activities, the family life
of Western businessmen suffers.
   For women inside Japan's corporate world, business entertainment
often means pouring tea during the day and whiskey after hours.
   Anastasia Morgan, 23, of Seattle, left a Japanese advertising
firm recently after finding her position as an assistant account
executive was short on substance and long on entertainment.
   She accepted serving tea to visitors as part of the job but
found that accompanying guests to hostess bars galled her.
   While young hostesses flirted with the men, Ms. Morgan was
expected to make pleasant conversation.
   ``There was a little bit of hanky-panky involved,'' she said.
``It was done in good taste, but you could sense the lust around
you. As a woman, I didn't want to see that.''
   She went along with it for a year and a half because, ``I came
to learn from Japan, not to change it.'' Pausing, she added, ``I
learned to deal with leches.''
   Sometimes the lechery becomes a commercial transaction.
   One Japanese businessman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
admitted he had been offered sex with a prostitute as a business
gift.
   Tapping his wedding ring, he said ``It happens, but we don't
talk about it.''
   For most businessmen, however, entertainment means a numbing
cycle of meals, drinks and golf.
   Takehiko Yamaguchi, formerly an executive of Marubeni Corp.,
says that while in the trading house's steel export division, he
``found it a bit tough'' to entertain two or three times a week.
   Yamaguchi, now a senior analyst at the Japan Institute for
Social and Economic Affairs, added: ``Japanese businessmen are not
so very pleased to entertain every night, but (it) is traditional.
It will not change in the near future.''

   The history of salmon-fishing in the
stormy North Pacific is filled with tales of brave fishermen riding
the wild seas, but its future is being shaped in calmer waters.
   Thousands of salmon in this sheltered arm of Puget Sound are
captives in sunken pens the size of basketball courts. Crowded fin
to fin, they swim endless laps, gobbling feed pellets and being
fattened toward the day they'll be scooped up and whisked to market.
   Yet while the crenulated coastline and pristine waters that
stretch from Washington's Puget Sound to southeastern Alaska might
be ideal for fish farming, the political climate is not so
welcoming.
   In Alaska, where commercial fishermen are a powerful lobby,
bumper stickers in fishing towns proclaim ``Real Fish Don't Eat
Pellets,'' and the Legislature is considering a permanent ban on
fish farms when a two-year moratorium expires in July.
   In Washington state, salmon farmers have the official blessing
of the Legislature, but that has helped little in the face of
challenges from fishermen and environmental groups, which have
defeated several proposed farms.
   The fish waste produced by a two-acre salmon farm is equivalent
to the sewage produced by a town of 5,000 people, claims a
Washington citizens group called the Marine Environmental
Consortium.
   Environmentalists also fear introduced species such as Atlantic
salmon _ favored because they fetch a higher price and are more
docile than Pacific salmon _ will corrupt the local gene pool and
spread disease. Wealthy owners of shoreside homes, meanwhile, don't
want fish farms spoiling their views.
   Promoters call fish farming an efficient way to help meet the
world's growing appetite for fish. Not only does it provide a
year-round supply of fresh salmon to supplement the seasonal wild
catch, they say, it also creates jobs free of the hazards of
commercial fishing, one of the nation's most dangerous occupations.
   They also contend salmon-farming provides an economic incentive
to preserve clean water.
   ``We're the best environmentalists of all, because we're
dependent on it,'' said Jerry Polley, site manager for Global Aqua,
the nation's largest salmon farm. ``If something's wrong with the
water quality, we're going to be the first to complain.''
   Production of farmed salmon, here and abroad, has boomed in five
years, flooding markets traditionally held by wild salmon and
driving down prices.
   ``For the first couple of years, as more salmon was around on a
year-round basis, the farmed fish seemed to help the wild market,''
said commercial fisherman Randy Babich. ``Now it's a battle at the
retail counter.''
   Fish farming, or aquaculture, is hardly a new concept. For
years, farmers have raised oysters in the Northwest, rainbow trout
in Idaho and catfish in the Southeast. But techniques have
developed more slowly in domesticating salmon, the mainstay of
fisheries off Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska.
   For years, it was practiced only by the Norwegians, forced into
salmon farming by their declining wild fish populations. But
interest has spread quickly since 1985, after Norway refined
methods to raise salmon cheaply enough to compete with the wild
catch.
   In 1983, world production of farmed salmon was 23,500 metric
tons, just 3 percent of the 670,000-ton wild salmon catch. By last
year, farmed salmon production had soared to an estimated 202,000
tons, or 30 percent of the relatively constant wild catch.
   Norway still leads the pack, producing about 75 percent of the
world's farmed salmon, but other places, including Scotland, Chile,
Canada and Iceland, are catching up. The United States, with 50
fish farms in Washington state and Maine, lags far behind,
producing 1 percent of the total.
   Many of the U.S. salmon farms are run by Norwegian companies,
including Global Aqua's four-acre operation in Rich Passage, 10
miles west of Seattle.
   Global Aqua's farm is fairly typical: a huge raft anchored
offshore holds 40 pens, each lined with a net holding up to 15 tons
of fish, which range from finger-size smolts to fat-bellied salmon
2 feet long.
   A half-dozen workers tend the pens from metal walkways, filling
automatic feeders and mending nets. At harvest, workers herd fish
into one end of the pens, scoop them out with an oversize dipnet
and load them onto a boat. The salmon are still kicking when they
reach a Seattle processing plant 30 minutes away.
   In the three years it takes to raise salmon to harvest, farmers
contend with prowling otters, hungry sea lions and diseases that
can wipe out whole farms if left unchecked.
   Aquaculturists say their operations will never be a major blot
on the coastline.
   ``It would take just 40 acres of farms to produce all of the
salmon that was imported into the United States in 1988,'' said
Chris Gibson of Sea Farm Washington in Port Angeles. ``The industry
does not need a lot of space.''
   It may need even less space in coming months. Worldwide growth
of salmon farming and recent overproduction in Norway have glutted
the market with fish. Prices have plunged, and many farms are
selling below cost just to keep cash flowing.
   In British Columbia, lax regulation and a surge of Norwegian
investment capital helped the number of fish farms soar from five
to 135 in the last six years. But now many are in trouble. Nineteen
have filed for receivership in the past year, and small businesses
are being bought out by large investors better able to outlast the
lull in prices.
   Aquaculture boosters profess confidence in their long-term place
in the salmon trade.
   Declining stocks of wild salmon already have forced Northwest
fishermen to rely more heavily on fish that are started in
shoreside hatcheries and released to sea. About 23 percent of
Alaska's ``wild'' catch now comes from hatcheries, while some
salmon populations off Washington's coast are 60 percent
hatchery-reared.
   ``We're not going to re-establish the wild resource. You just
don't have the habitat for them to come back to,'' said John Pitts,
who promotes aquaculture for the Washington Department of
Agriculture. ``Future generations will become more dependent on
aquaculture.''
   Perhaps, but as long as any wild salmon remain, some
independent-minded fishermen will take their chances on the high
seas rather than turn in their rain slickers for bags of fish chow.
   ``It's the Cro-Magnon in us,'' said Randy Babich. ``Fishing is
one of the last hunting-gathering professions in the world. Tossing
feed into a pond just doesn't provide the same adventure.''

   Carl Gershman, whose job is fostering the
spread of democracy around the world, has it easy these days.
Democracy is fostering itself.
   When Gershman wrote the annual report of the organization he
heads, the National Endowment for Democracy, he warned of
democracy's vulnerabilities and of setbacks here and there. But
nothing could hide one triumphant fact.
   The ``central reality'' of these times, he wrote, is that
``throughout the world millions of people are striving to establish
and secure democratic systems based upon peaceful political
competition, the rule of law, a free market economy and respect for
basic human rights.''
   The endowment, created by Congress in 1983 at Ronald Reagan's
suggestion, draws its money from the government but is administered
privately. It receives less than $20 million a year, small change
in Washington.
   It doles out grants _ as little as a few thousand dollars, as
much as $1 million to Solidarity in Poland in 1988 _ to bolster
democracy where it is tender or to support independent groups in
closed societies.
   In an interview, in his year-end report and in an essay,
Gershman offered one expert's view of how the worldwide assertion
of the democratic spirit happened to occur at this time.
   He thinks he can pinpoint the crucial place and moment: Portugal
in the mid-1970s.
   At that moment, Gershman said, democracy seemed to be in
retreat. America, democracy's bastion, was experiencing self-doubt,
the Vietnam malaise.
   Intellectuals argued over whether the United States should
support right-wing authoritarian regimes if they were opposed to
left-wing totalitarian regimes, ``a debate which was based upon the
assumption that the best we could hope for was the lesser evil,''
said Gershman.
   Then, in Portugal, the poorest country in Western Europe,
bloodied by the loss of its overseas colonies, a military coup
overthrew a dicatorship.
   In the confusion, communists attempted to seize power. But the
people injected themselves into the streets _ much as they would do
in 1989 in Eastern Europe _ and popular government prevailed. A
republic was proclaimed and a constitution adopted.
   Next door, Spain's dictator, Francisco Franco, a remnant of
pre-war fascism, died. A similiar struggle resulted in a
parliamentary monarchy. Greece, too, underwent a transition toward
democracy.
   From there, the wind swept through Latin America. Ninety percent
of the region's people lived under authoritarian rule at the start
of the 1980s; now every country in the hemisphere except Haiti and
Cuba has some form of democratic government or is planning
elections.
   Next, of course, the democratic bug descended on Europe: Poland,
Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslvakia, Romania and within the Soviet
borders themselves.
   In Asia, the uprisings were less successful, brutally suppressed
in China and Burma, but their occurrence, Gershman said, ``should
erase any remaining doubts about the appeal of the democratic idea
in the non-Western world.''
   While Gershman does not claim that these events are linked _
that the overthrow of the 18-year rule of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner
in Paraguay last year somehow precipitated the street uprisings of
Eastern Europe _ he does conclude that they did not occur in
isolation, either.
   ``Events have a momentum of their own and no country can be
shielded from the sweep of historical forces,'' he said.
   Several historical forces coincided to drive democracy forward
on a global scale, he said, among them:
   _The scientific and technological revolution, which rigid
political systems could not assimilate.
   _The communications revolution, which makes for rising
expectations.
   _The tendency toward a world economy, which subjects governments
to the discipline of the market.
   _The human rights revolution of the 1970s, which ``spread the
view that all individuals have rights that governments must
respect.''
   With that idea fixed, ``you need to find a way in which people
can live together in peace, to negotiate differences without
violence,'' Gershman said.
   ``The alternative to democracy is simply the imposition of
tyrannical force, and that doesn't work very well. It produces a
lot of deaths, it doesn't produce economic growth, it means one
group ruling over another and the other resorting to violence
because they've been excluded.''

   A rundown from the annual report of the
National Endowment for Democracy on the events that were part of
the ``resurgence of democracy'' in 1989:
   _``Mass demonstrations in China and the erection of the Goddess
of Democracy statue in Tiananmen Square.''
   _``An election in Poland swept by Solidarity and eventuating in
the Soviet bloc's first non-Communist government.''
   _``A hero's burial for Imre Nagy, the executed leader of the
1956 Hungarian Revolution.''
   _``Millions linking hands across the Baltics on the 50th
anniversary of the Hitler-Stalin Pact.''
   _``Throngs rejoicing atop the Berlin Wall after the East German
government effectively abolished that notorious symbol of Communist
oppression.''
   _``The resignation of the Stalinist regime in Czechoslovakia
under pressure from hundreds of thousands of demonstrators
demanding the restoration of democracy.''
   _``The overthrow of the Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay, the
Ceausescu dictatorship in Romania and the Noriega dictatorship in
Panama.''
   _``The most open election in the history of the Soviet Union.''
   _``The peaceful demise of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile.''
   _``Free elections in Namibia.''
   _``A legal opposition contesting elections for the first time in
Taiwan.''
   _``The peaceful transfer of power following sharply contested
elections in India and Brazil, the Third World's two largest
democracies.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And these were some of the setbacks:
   _``The bloody suppression of the democracy movement in China.''
   _``The use of poison gas against peaceful demonstrators in
Soviet Georgia.''
   _``Violent uprisings against democratically elected governments
in El Salvador and the Philippines.''
   _``The violent disruption of opposition election rallies in
Nicaragua.''
   _``The bloody suppression of demonstrations in Romania.''
   _``And in El Salvador, Colombia, Peru and elsewhere the murder
of priests, journalists, politicians and peasants by terrorists and
death squads.''

<TEXT>
   Alan Bond lost a month-long court
battle to save his lucrative brewing interests from receivership,
dealing a further blow to the embattled Australian tycoon's
crumbling empire.
   The Supreme Court of the state of Victoria said Friday that Bond
Brewing Holdings had made a deliberate decision to keep people with
any knowledge of the affairs of the Bond group away from the court.
   The court also found it extraordinary that the company had
deliberately excluded relevant material from the case.
   On Dec. 29, the court appointed receivers and managers to
several of Bond Corp.'s brewing interests at the request of the
National Australia Bank Ltd., which was acting as agent for a
syndicate of banks that is owed about $660 million by the Bond
group.
   The court said the banking syndicate was entirely justified in
seeking receivers for Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd., Bond Brewing
Investments Pty. Ltd., Swan Brewery Co., Castlemaine Perkins Ltd.,
Tooheys Ltd. and BBH Securities Pty. Ltd.
   The banks had claimed that Bond Brewing Holdings had broken
several convenants of a loan agreement. The court said evidence
heard in January's month-long court battle reinforced its original
decision.
   Bond, whose interests also span media, property and natural
resources, is estimated to have debts of more than $6 billion.

   The Treasury Department on Thursday received just $18.4 billion
in bids for $10 billion of bonds, in what had been termed a

<TEXT>
   Murdoch Magazines, a division of Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., plans to make available commercially
sponsored programming for use in beauty salons starting in June.
   It would be the first regularly scheduled video program from
Murdoch Magazines, and the first video entertainment program aimed
at reaching clients of beauty salons, the company said Thursday.
   Phillip Cassidy, director of special projects at Murdoch
Magazines, said his company hopes to sign up at least 3,000 beauty
salons reaching 2 to 2.5 million women for the launch of the
service.
   But while creating television programs for people getting their
hair done may be new, the concept of trying to reach people in
unusual settings is not.
   A number of media companies have come up with magazines,
sponsored posters and video programs designed to reach patients in
waiting rooms, pet owners at the veterinarians and students at
school.
   In what may be the most controversial commercial video project
to date, Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., plans to
launch its Channel One daily news show with commercials next month
in more than 1,000 classrooms across the country.
   The service has been vilified as an unjustified intrusion on the
rights of students who are required by law to be in school.
   The Murdoch Magazines project is not likely to cause any such
uproar.
   Cassidy said the service, called Salon Network, would consist of
a bi-monthly program of 30 to 40 minutes drawing on health,
fashion, beauty and other stories that appear in its Mirabella, New
Woman, Seventeen, Premiere and European Travel &amp; Life magazines.
   He said the programs would be distributed on two-hour
videocassettes to beauty shops that already have their own
videocasette recorders and television monitors. The salons would be
expected to air the tapes for four hours a day.
   A new program would be made available every other month.
   Each program would contain 7{ to 10 minutes of commercials, 5
minutes of which would be sold to advertisers and the remaining
time used to promote services available at particular salons.
   Murdoch said its production partner in the venture is TeleTime
Inc., a privately-owned production company based in Great Neck,
N.Y., that has previously created programs in beauty shops for
individual sponsors.
   Cassidy said he has been presenting the plan to advertisers for
about a week and plans to begin showing it to beauty salon
operators next month.
   No clients have been signed yet, he said. The advertising rates
will be $20,000 for a 30-second commercial. The promotions will be
run for free.
   Cassidy said that if the program proves successful, Murdoch
Magazines would probably begin offering advertisers the chance to
buy packages that include ad space in magazines and commercial time
on Salon Network starting next year.

<HEAD>Mazda Moves into Sport-Utility Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp. has entered the already crowded
four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle market with a two-door
version at a time when other automakers are shifting to four-door
models.
   Mazda officials said Thursday that dealers will begin selling
the Navajo sport-utility vehicle this fall. It will compete against
a swelling number of entries from companies hoping to grab part of
one of the few market segments forecast to grow in the early 1990s.
   Unlike other companies, Mazda, which calls itself a ``targeted
niche marketer,'' will sell only a two-door vehicle, made by Ford
Motor Co. beside its new Explorer.
   ``We simply can't afford not to be in this market,'' said Clark
Vitulli, general manager of Mazda's U.S. marketing arm.
   The popularity of the four-door vehicles has zoomed recently,
with each of the Big Three and some Japanese competitors getting
into the market. Most of the four-door buyers rarely, if ever, take
the vehicles off the road, an original selling point for Jeeps and
others.
   Generally, four-door sport-utility vehicles are seen as
appealing to families while two-door versions are more likely to be
used in the back country.
   Mazda's Navajo, the Japanese company's first sport-utility
vehicle for U.S. dealers, will be built at Ford's light-truck
assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford began building its Explorer
there Monday.
   Ford officials said about 70 percent of the 200,000 or so
Explorers it intends to sell annually will have four doors.
   Mazda, which plans to sell less than 20,000 Navajos a year, is
banking that families shopping for four-wheel-drive vehicles will
head to its minivan, called the MPV.
   ``We concluded the MPV is a better way to serve this customer,''
Vitulli said.
   Sport-utility vehicles made up 14.5 percent of the light truck
segment last year, up tremendously from 1982 when they had just 1.5
percent. Manufacturers and analysts expect sport-utility vehicles
and minivans will gain in popularity while other parts of the total
vehicle market shrink.
   Vitulli projected the sport-utility vehicle segment alone will
grow by 24 percent by 1992.
   Over the past few months, Ford, General Motors Corp., Toyota
Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. have introduced four-door
vehicles to compete with four-door Jeeps, the market leader made by
Chrysler Corp.
   There will be only slight differences between the Navajo and the
Explorer, mostly in some interior and exterior styling and larger
bumpers on Mazda's version.
   Prices have not been set for either vehicle.
   The sport-utility project is the second U.S. vehicle
manufacturing agreement between Ford and Mazda. Ford gets its Probe
cars from Mazda's plant in Flat Rock, Mich.
   Mazda's introduction came during a media preview of the Chicago
Auto Show, which opens Saturday. Also on Thursday:
   _Ford introduced its 1991 Escort GT and Mercury Tracer cars.
They are the products of an engineering cooperation between Mazda
and Ford.
   Ford said it wants to sell more than 400,000 Escorts and Tracers
in 1991. Escorts will be made in Wayne, Mich., and Tracers will be
assembled in Hermosillo, Mexico. The government will classify
Tracers as domestic vehicles because more than 75 percent of each
car is made in the United States.
   _Robert Rewey, Ford's vice president for North American sales,
said the company had reduced its new-car inventories into the 60-to
70-day range, about normal for this time of year. GM and Chrysler
plan indefinite plant shutdowns during the next seven weeks, which
will result in thousands of auto workers being laid off.
   Each of the nation's Big Three automakers shut down assembly
plants in January for a week or more at a time.
   ``I believe that the inventory correction that we planned was
essentially completed at the end of January,'' Rewey said.

<HEAD>Investors Group to Mount Avon Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of powerful investors including the
owners of Mary Kay Cosmetics and a Getty family trust says it plans
to launch a proxy fight to win four seats on the board of Avon
Products Inc.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday, Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership, also
disclosed it had increased its stake in Avon, a New York-based
cosmetics company, to 9.1 percent.
   Chartwell said it favored a sale of Avon but ruled out any
intention to seek a merger of Avon and Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   John Cox, a spokesman for Avon, which twice rejected unsought
takeover bids last year, said the company had no comment.
   Partners in Chartwell Associates include the Fisher real estate
family of New York as well as the family trust of oil heir Gordon
P. Getty and a subsidiary of Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp., the
parent of Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   In its filing, Chartwell said it plans to solicit proxies from
Avon shareholders to nominate four persons for the 11-member Avon
board.
   A proxy battle is an attempt by a person or group to take over a
company or oust its management by obtaining enough proxies _ the
legal right to exercise a shareholder's vote _ to influence a
corporate election.
   In this case the battle is over Chartwell's belief that Avon
shareholders ``would best be served by a sale of the company,'' a
view Chartwell said was not shared by Avon's board.
   The Chartwell filing continued that the partnership ``may submit
a proposal for a merger or similar transaction'' between Avon and
one of the entities of Chartwell Associates or an affiliate _ other
than Mary Kay.
   ``In no event, however, will Mary Kay or Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.
merge with the company (Avon) nor will the sales forces of the
company and MKCI be integrated or combined with each other in any
manner whatsoever,'' the filing said.
   The document said Chartwell has purchased 5.16 million shares of
Avon for a total of $173.4 million since November.

<HEAD>Bank Apparently Borrows more than $700 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp.'s cash crisis apparently
hasn't abated despite the recent sale of more than $1.1 billion in
assets, an analyst says.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, considered the lender of
last resort for banks, reported Thursday that it loaned an
unusually high amount of $723 million to member banks this week.
   Marcia Ryan, a Bank of New England spokeswoman, confirmed that
the bank borrowed money from the Federal Reserve. She declined to
give the amount, except to say it was ``slightly above last week.''
   ``Our borrowing was as we expected it to be,'' she said.
   Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., said Bank
of New England likely was the prime borrower, and he said the
numbers were particularly troubling because until this week the
bank appeared to have gained more control over its problems.
   Two weeks ago, the Boston Fed loaned $478 million, and last week
the figure dropped to $440 million. At the same time, Bank of New
England has completed asset sales of more than $1.1 billion.
   ``It means the situation is still bleeding,'' Cassidy said.
   Bank of New England reported last month that its 1989 losses
should exceed $1 billion, largely because of bad real estate loans.
The bank has been trying to sell $6 billion of assets to raise
cash, after watching depositors withdraw millions of dollars.
   Ryan noted that the bank has not received all the proceeds from
its recent asset sales, though she could not say specifically how
much money the bank has collected.
   In comparison with recent Boston Fed lending totals, the weekly
figures from mid-December to mid-January ranged from $1 million to
$5 million, said Herb Wass, a Federal Reserve spokesman.
   The Federal Reserve does not identify the institutions borrowing
the money.
   Wass stressed that the loans normally are repaid within a day
and do not accumulate.
   Earlier in the day, it was announced that The Bank of Tokyo had
restructured a deal to buy part of Bank of New England's leasing
business after the Japanese company became concerned about the
bank's troubles.
   Under the new agreement, Bank of New England will sell Bank of
Tokyo its BancNewEngland Leasing Group operations and $500 million
of its lease portfolio, and record a profit of $92.5 million.
   The original terms of the agreement announced last November
would have given Bank of New England a $110 million gain.
   ``Bank of Tokyo expressed concern about Bank of New England,
given the publicity the last few weeks,'' said Tom Lavelle, a bank
spokesman. ``There's been some give and take on both sides.''
   Lavelle noted that under the new agreement, Bank of Tokyo will
cut by 20 percent the cost to service a $1 billion leasing
portfolio retained by Bank of New England.
   ``The revised terms of the sale do not change the advantages to
us of the previously announced transaction,'' H. Ridgely Bullock,
the bank's interim chairman, said in a statement. ``The transaction
will help improve our capital ratios and will raise in excess of
$500 million in cash.''
   Bullock said he hoped to complete the transaction ``within the
next several weeks.''

<HEAD>Judge Makes It Easier For Georgia-Pacific To Oust Great Northern
Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling that just a
two-thirds vote by shareholders can oust Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp.'s directors was hailed by Georgia-Pacific Corp. as a major
victory in its $3.8 billion takeover attempt.
   ``We are delighted with the court's decision,'' said
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. ``This is one more
important advance in bringing Georgia-Pacific closer to completing
this acquisition, which we believe is best for Great Northern
shareholders, employees and communities in which they operate.''
   A Great Northern spokesman declined to predict whether directors
will be able to survive a March 2 proxy vote in light of U.S.
District Judge Gene Carter's decision, which lowered the percentage
of votes needed to oust the board from three-fourths to two-thirds.
   ``We're disappointed, and we certainly are going to study what
he had to say, and then we'll decide how to react to it,'' Great
Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said from his office in Norwalk,
Conn.
   Carter agreed with Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific that the
three-fourths requirement in Great Northern's bylaws ran afoul of
Maine corporate law. The judge also struck down two more portions
of the company's bylaws that allowed outgoing directors to name a
new board and called for a 90-day nomination period for new
directors.
   Great Northern's board has been fighting the takeover attempt,
but Georgia-Pacific succeeded in forcing next month's special
shareholders meeting in Portland.
   Georgia-Pacific contends that Great Northern's directors are
resisting the takeover offer so they can hold onto their own
high-paying jobs at the expense of shareholders.
   Despite Thursday's setback, Great Northern still hopes to
persuade the judge to block Georgia-Pacific's effort to oust its
board. The judge plans to hear oral arguments Monday on that motion.
   Great Northern also hopes to block the hostile tender offer on
grounds including allegations that Georgia-Pacific has violated
federal securities laws by covering up plans to sell Maine assets
should the deal go through.

<HEAD>Fun With Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising company that uses all the
tricks of the trade to boost consumer appetites for raw
agricultural products believes in a fun food fight.
   Ketchum Communications Inc. leads a growing number of firms
battling old images to give people a new and, at times, humorous,
way of thinking about food staples.
   Prunes, for example. They shouldn't remind you of something
you'd most likely find at grandma's house. Ketchum touted them as
``high fiber fruit.''
   Or raisins. Instead of gobbling them straight from the box,
Ketchum advises adding them to citrus juice and dabbing the mixture
on a slice of salmon for a ``pink lady.''
   Ketchum's campaign pushing beef as ``real food for real people''
is probably its best known one. It used Hollywood stars to tell
consumers that meat can be low calorie and packed with protein.
   Pittsburgh-based Ketchum, with offices in San Francisco and
several other major cities, claims the largest client list of
commodity boards of any advertising and public relations company in
the United States.
   The agency believes says food producers need new strategies to
get their goods into the modern kitchen, where the microwave is
king and old-fashioned cooking techniques are becoming obsolete.
   ``American home life has taken to the fast lane,'' Ketchum
spokesman Phil Siegel says.
   ``With a growing need to do everything quickly, longstanding
traditions, like baking, are being lost. And the marketers of
certain food staples are now forced to rethink strategies and
inspire consumers to use traditional products in non-traditional
ways. After all, how can baking ingredients, like walnuts and
raisins, be sold to a country of non-bakers?''
   The nation's more than 200 commodity boards consist of farmers,
shippers and distributors of food products _ from salmon to wild
rice _ that unite to market their products.
   Dianne Snedaker, president of Ketchum's San Francisco ad
division, said the firm's commodity business has tripled in the
last five years and accounted for nearly $200 million of its $750
million in billings last year. The Beef Industry Council, Ketchum's
largest commodity client, has increased its marketing budget
eightfold since 1981 to $35 million, for example.
   The growth should slow because the number of boards is limited
and Ketchum's contracts with some, like the beef council, prohibit
the firm from accepting rival clients, like the chicken or pork
boards. Still, Snedaker predicts further growth in billings this
decade.
   ``I have always considered them the premiere public relations
agency for food in the United States,'' said Robert Phinney,
director of the California Raisin Advisory Board.
   His group became a household word overnight after its
advertising agency _ Foote, Cone &amp; Belding _ created the California
Dancing Raisins in 1985. Ketchum later created human models for the
characters that toured the nation, even getting invited to
President Bush's inaugural parade.
   ``Ketchum made a concerted effort 20 years ago to be pioneers by
taking the (marketing) expertise from the rest of the food industry
and bringing it to commodity groups,'' said Phinney, whose board
was Ketchum's first commodity client in 1971.
   Ketchum's clients list also includes the California Strawberry
Advisory Board, California Prune Board, the Peanut Advisory Board,
the Wisconsin Milk Marketing board, Norway Sardines, the American
Egg Board and the National Mushroom Growers Association.
   The key to finding a new image for food staples is keeping track
of how people eat. Snedaker says company research shows that a
remarkable number of people eat while standing up.
   Allen Miller, executive vice president of Ketchum's public
relations division, says food marketers find many people have grown
up with little cooking experience because of the advent of the
microwaves and fast foods.
   ``You've got to show these people how to quickly and easily make
a meal out of something you don't necessarily take out of a
package,'' Miller said.
   Take potatoes. Ketchum has been trying to boost sales for the $2
billion American potato crop by calling them the ideal fast-food in
the age of the microwave.
   Magazine advertisements tout the vegetable's ``smooth skin'' and
``luscious curves.'' ``Aerodynamically designed for speed,'' it is
the perfect alternative to food like pasta, one ad stresses.
   Ketchum has sponsored food preparation demonstrations by cooking
experts in stores and on television shows to show how to prepare
potatoes and other food staples in the microwave, other than just
baking.
   Ketchum also runs a food research center, where it experiments
with new ways for producers to capture greater slices of the $220
billion annual food service industry.
   The center worked on walnuts, finely grinding them to invent a
creamy walnut smear for bakery use. It also formulated
chocolate-covered walnuts that withstand freezing and created a
walnut additive for ice cream.
   By creating American versions of traditional Japanese recipes,
Ketchum was able to help increase sales of Kikkoman soy sauce by 25
percent during the first year of a marketing program, according to
Kaz Takei, a Kikkoman International Inc. vice president.

<HEAD>Loans Totaling $700 Million Expected to Get Judge's Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY KINNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge indicated that
Federated Department Stores Inc. would get approval for a $400
million loan before a ``drop dead'' bank deadline, enabling the
retailer to keep its shelves stocked.
   After more than eight hours of testimony Thursday and a
last-minute compromise proposed by Federated's unsecured creditors,
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said he would review the
agreement and sign it today.
   A similar proposal by Federated's sister retailer, Allied Stores
Corp., to borrow $300 million from Chemical Bank of New York was
expected to face no opposition at a hearing today, attorneys for
Federated told Aug.
   The $400 million debtor-in-possession loan from a 90-bank
syndicate led by Citibank would be in addition to a $1 billion
financing package allowing Federated to sell credit card receipts
to a subsidiary, Federated Credit Corp. The credit division wasn't
among those that filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors
Jan. 15 with Federated and Allied.
   ``There was a great deal of testimony today that provided the
committee with information that had not been available
previously,'' said Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer for the committee of
unsecured creditors.
   ``It permitted the committee to better understand the
consequences involved, and we also were able to make some changes
in debtor's proposal to give the creditors greater assurances,'' he
said.
   The committee also withdrew its opposition to the $1 billion
receivables.
   In return, Federated gave the unsecured creditors ``substantial
protections,'' Rosenbloom said, including guarantees that all
inventory _ which the committee considered excess _ will remain in
the estate. Federated also will provide a monthly accounting of all
its operating units, he said.
   Federated and Allied, the U.S. retail division of Toronto-based
Campeau Corp., listed $7.7 billion in debt when they filed for
Chapter 11 protection.
   The two divisions employ about 100,000 people and operate 260
stores within nine chains _ Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's
of New York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati, Rich's of
Atlanta in the Federated group; and The Bon Marche of Seattle,
Jordan Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa, and Stern's of
Paramus, N.J., in the Allied group.
   Federated treasurer Mark Kennedy testified at the hearing that
Federated could not survive more than a month without the infusion
of money. He said the retailer had been turned down by other
lenders, and that vendors would lose all confidence in Federated if
Aug refused to approve the loan.
   Quick approval was needed to beat Citibank's Feb. 14 deadline.
   The creditors' committee had opposed the loan, contending that
Federated does not need the money and had pledged the creditors'
only collateral _ its inventory _ to get the loan.
   But Kennedy testified that Federated had no contingency plan if
approval were denied, and that Federated wouldn't survive the two
months it would take to negotiate another loan, providing a lender
could be found.
   ``The company doesn't have 60 days _ 30 days maybe,'' Kennedy
said.
   ``The existence of the loan is mandatory to re-establish our
credibility in the eyes of our creditors ... A headline which says
`Federated DIP Rejected' would have a disastrous effect.''
   Kennedy said failure to get the loan would put Federated in
default of the $1 billion receivables arrangement.
   Creditors had objected to Federated putting its profitable store
chains under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Kennedy testified
that three of the profitable ones _ Bloomingdale's, Burdines and
Rich's _ were worth more than $1 billion each and probably could be
liquidated to pay creditors full value for their goods.
   But he said although Federated has $858 million in inventory and
$250 million cash on hand, forcing Federated to spend all its cash
to buy merchandise would ensure its demise.
   ``The biggest losers would be the creditors of this company,''
Kennedy said.
   One of the provisions of the loan is that Federated cannot
borrow more than 40 percent of the wholesale value of its
inventory, meaning that Federated could borrow the full $400
million only if it had $1 billion in inventory.

<HEAD>S&amp;P Lowers Sears Bond Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says Sears, Roebuck and
Co. deserves a lower debt rating because of the weak performance of
its retailing business.
   S&amp;P said Thursday it was lowering its ratings of Sears'
long-term bonds and commercial paper.
   The downgrade implies lowered confidence in the company's
ability to repay its debts. It is S&amp;P's second downgrade of Sears
debt instruments since the retailing giant announced a new
merchandising strategy in October 1988.
   At least two other bond-rating companies, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., also have downgraded Sears
debt ratings since the switch to ``everyday low pricing'' was
announced.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather declined comment on the
downgrade.
   On Monday, Chicago-based Sears released fourth-quarter and
annual results that were slightly better than expected but still
showed a decline in merchandise-group earnings after extraordinary
items were excluded.
   Sears has been battling a decade-long slide in its share of the
retail market. The company has pinned its hopes on the switch to
everyday low pricing, with competitive prices year-round and fewer
sales.
   ``The downgrade reflects a slower-than-expected recovery in
Sears' retailing operations, despite the implementation of a costly
and comprehensive strategy to arrest a steady deterioration in that
core business,'' S&amp;P said in a statement.
   The rating firm said Sears' overall financial condition was
strong and its financial-services businesses _ Dean Witter
brokerage services, Allstate insurance and Coldwell Banker real
estate _ added diversity and strength.
   Nevertheless, S&amp;P said its new rating of Sears' debt instruments
``anticipates continued sub-par performance for the next couple of
years.''
   S&amp;P downgraded Sears' senior long-term debt rating by one notch
to A-plus from AA-minus, and lowered its commercial-paper rating
one notch to A-1 from A-1-plus.
   S&amp;P also lowered its debt ratings of the following Sears'
subsidiaries: Discover Credit Corp., Sears Overseas Finance N.V.
and Sears Roebuck Acceptance Corp.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former No. 2 official at the General
Accounting Office is emerging as the top candidate to replace
thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, according to administration,
congressional and industry sources.
   Frederick D. Wolf is known for offering a blunt assessment of
the savings and loan industry during 1988, when Wall was offering a
more optimistic evaluation.
   He is backed by Treasury Department officials who worked with
him while fashioning President Bush's S&amp;L bailout last year and by
senior aides to the Senate Banking Committee, which would have to
vote on his confirmation.
   Wolf has been lobbying for support from members of Congress,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday.
   But Wolf's independence and popularity with congressional
Democrats may hurt his candidacy, according to two industry
officials. The administration must already cope with Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who often
differs with Treasury officials on regulatory issues.
   The bailout legislation made Wall's agency, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, a wing of the Treasury Department. Also, the thrift
office director would sit on Seidman's five-member board, which
handles the deposit insurance funds for the S&amp;L and banking
industries and governs the Resolution Trust Corp., the S&amp;L bailout
agency.
   ``Wolf's enormously able, outspoken, blunt and understands the
issues,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America. ``But, he's an
independent force and there's some concern in Treasury about
bringing in an independent force.''
   However, another industry official said, ``When all is said and
done, I don't think they have another choice.''
   Wolf did not return a telephone call seeking comment Thursday.
   About a dozen names of possible successors have circulated, but
most have ruled themselves out. Provisions in the S&amp;L bill applying
to the RTC would prevent the thrift office director from working
for or representing an insured financial institution until two
years after leaving office.
   William Taylor, director of bank supervision for the Federal
Reserve System, was asked to consider the thrift office post but
opted to stay at his current job, which pays a higher salary and is
independent of the administration, according to congressional
sources.
   Another possible candidate is William T. Graham, banking
commissioner in North Carolina. A former judge, he was active in
Bush's 1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns. According to a
government source, Graham was interviewed in Washington for the job.
   Meanwhile, the administration is coming under increasing
pressure to decide on a thrift director soon. The U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, and House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, have written to Bush urging action.
   ``I have applauded your `never again' statements about the
savings and loan crisis,'' Gonzalez wrote the president earlier
this month. ``I am very disappointed that this affirmation has been
diminished by allowing regulators _ who share responsibility for
the disaster _ to remain in office.''
   Wall, who announced his resignation Dec. 4 after harsh criticism
from Congress for his handling of the failed Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, is anxious to move on, according to his aides.
   An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the administration intended to decide on Wall's successor ``in
the near future'' and called Wolf ``an extremely capable,
experienced person.''
   But even if Wolf is selected soon, the clearance process,
including FBI checks, could take several months.
   Before joining the GAO, Wolf, 49, spent 22 years with Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co., an accounting firm. He recently left the GAO after
six years, including nine months as assistant comptroller general,
to become a partner at the Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. accounting firm.
   The American Banker, a trade publication, first reported Wolf's
emergence as the leading candidate for thrift office director
earlier this week.

   The oil slick spreading from the tanker
American Trader spilled into politics as officials and
environmentalists demanded stronger controls on oil industry
operations in coastal waters.
   ``We need to do something to make sure this doesn't happen
again,'' Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate
for governor, told a news conference in Huntington Beach on
Thursday.
   Controller Gray Davis, a member of the California Lands
Commission, pledged a state investigation into the 295,000-gallon
spill and said his panel would urge Congress to require tankers to
be fitted with double hulls.
   The commission, which regulates oil development in state lands
and waters, has declared previously unprotected tracts in state
waters off-limits to new drilling.
   The spill off Huntington Beach renewed debate about requiring a
double hull and double bottom on tankers, a move opposed by many
oil industry executives because of the higher cost and arguable
safety advantages.
   ``This oil spill is another warning that our legislators are
dragging their feet on double-hulled tankers, at great peril to our
environment,'' said Dorothy Green, head of Heal the Bay, a local
environmental group.
   A number of officials speculated that a large swell plopped the
American Trader onto its own anchor Wednesday, punching a 3-foot
hole into the single-hulled ship's bottom as it maneuvered toward
an offshore mooring.
   ``If the information is born out that this tanker lifted up and
came down on its own anchor, double-hulling the vessel may well
have prevented the spill,'' said Peter Douglas, executive director
of the state Coastal Commission.
   ``The double hull, in this case, could have avoided the spill,''
said Jerry Aspland, president of Arco Marine Inc. and a former ship
captain experienced in offshore moorings.
   But he stressed other factors, including human error, may have
played a more significant role in the spill.
   In Washington, Democratic Rep. George Miller said British
Petroleum Oil Shipping Co. USA, which leased the American Trader,
has led lobbying against comprehensive oil spill liability
legislation pending in Congress.
   A conference committee is working on differing House and Senate
bills to produce a measure both chambers can approve by the March
24 anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound.
   The main sticking point concerns double bottoms and double
hulls. The House wants them on all tankers calling at U.S. ports
with oil or hazardous materials within seven and 15 years,
respectively. The Senate bill calls for further study, a position
backed by the oil industry.
   Miller told a news conference that British Petroleum was leading
efforts to ``gut the oil spill liability bill.''
   That drew a response from Bill Rountree, vice president for
federal government affairs with British Petroleum.
   ``BP America has supported enactment of comprehensive oil spill
legislation for close to a decade,'' Rountree said by telephone.
``We support a $1 billion federal fund and increasing liability
limits on ship owners.''
   Using the American Trader as a backdrop at a beachside news
conference, Davis and Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy called on the state
Assembly to pass the Oil Spill Prevention and Cleanup Act, which
would establish a $500 million reserve, funded by the oil industry,
for spill cleanup.
   Davis said the oil companies to date have indicated they are
willing to contribute a total of $10 million to such a fund.
   The bill would require tankers operating in state waters to be
equipped with booms and other cleanup equipment, and require tanker
companies to have $400 million in insurance to meet legal costs,
said Ed Manning, a McCarthy aide who authored the legislation.
   Davis said Thursday that had the bill been in effect, British
Petroleum could have been required to pay an estimated $25 million
penalty to the state.
   The cleanup and prevention act will be heard Feb. 26 by the
state Assembly's Natural Resources Commission, Manning said.
   Some activists said the spill should remind the nation about the
hazards of reliance on oil as an energy source.
   ``The whole issue is that every gallon of oil we save is one
less gallon of oil that must be pumped and transported and one less
gallon that can spill,'' said Bob Hattoy, regional director of the
Sierra Club of Southern California.

   Environmentalists claim Democratic Senate
leaders are buckling under to White House pressure and agreeing to
too many weakening amendments during closed-door talks on clean air
legislation.
   ``The public health is being negotiated away,'' argued Dan
Weiss, who has been following the clean air debate in the Senate
for the Sierra Club.
   Senate leaders and Bush administration officials have been
negotiating for more than a week in an attempt to work out a
compromise air pollution control bill and avoid a floor fight.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Thursday
that he expected the criticism, but said the critics ``should
evaluate the final product against current law'' which he said
would be greatly strengthened.
   Mitchell and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, said
that although progress was being made, further discussions are
being delayed until after Congress returns from a week-long recess
Feb. 20.
   While tentative agreement has been reached some areas such as
curbing toxic and smog-causing pollution by industry, major
differences remain over how to reduce urban smog caused by
pollution from automobiles. The Senate bill calls for tough
second-stage tailpipe controls, while the administration says those
provisions are too expensive and favors a phase-in of alternative
fuel cars in regions with the dirtiest air.
   ``We are making progress,'' said Dole, R-Kan., who along with
senior White House and Environmental Protection Agency officials
has been pushing for the changes sought by President Bush in the
closed-door meetings.
   But various environmental groups argued Thursday that too many
strong provisions in the original Senate bill were being negotiated
away under White House pressure.
   ``They're not talking about any strengthening amendments, only
weakening ones,'' said Richard Ayres, executive director of the
Clean Air Coalition, which is made up of various environmental
organizations.
   ``The longer these negotiations go on, the weaker the bill
gets,'' charged Casey Padgett, legislative director for
Environmental Action.
   Both the Senate bill and the administration proposal call for
tougher controls on auto pollution and releases of toxic and
smog-causing pollution from industrial sources, as well as a 10
million-ton reduction of acid rain pollutants, primarily from
electric power plants.
   The environmentalists criticized a compromise allowing the
Environmental Protection Agency to issue a waiver of federal air
quality standards for certain areas if the cost of doing so exceeds
$5,000 per ton of pollution.
   Other provisions already agreed upon by the negotiators would no
longer automatically require the EPA to impose a clean air plan if
local officials were unable or unwilling to do so.
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
called the environmentalists' criticisms groundless. They said the
EPA still could disapprove any waiver and that the federal
government has never imposed a cleanup program on a community
anyway.
   The officials argued that under the proposal, urban areas still
would have to improve their air quality by specific yearly
increments, something not now required.

   On the baseball diamond, it's Mets versus Cubs.
For architects, it's Sears Tower vs. World Trade Center.
   Now, Nathan's Famous of New York has thrown some fat and other
byproducts on the fire of the Chicago-New York rivalry.
   They're calling it th war of the dogs.
   Relish the thought: New York-style frankfurters girded against
Chi Dogs.
   It's still too early to tell which wiener can cut the mustard.
   Nathan's of Westbury, N.Y. _ dating back to 1916 and famous for
its hot dog stands on Coney Island's boardwalk and 42nd Street in
the Big Apple _ decided last year to open a place in the Windy
City, home to 3,000 hot dog stands.
   It looked like a tough market to crack for the New Yorkers, who
say frank when they mean hot dog.
   But Nathan's marketing research showed that many Chicagoans were
familiar with the company's name and would pay extra for a gourmet
frank that cost $1.59.
   ``We figured if we could make it there (Chicago), we could make
it anywhere,'' said Larry Feierstein, a vice-president of Nathan's
in New York, New York.
   Frankly, not everyone was throwing out the welcome mat.
   ``Does Newcastle need coal? Does Alaska need salmon? Does Idaho
need potatoes? More than 3,000 hot dog stands in greater, grander
metropolitan Chicagoland _ and these people come bearing
frankfurters?'' said a tongue-in-cheek editorial from the Chicago
Tribune last week.
   Nevertheless, around Thanksgiving Day, Nathan's Famous opened up
shop where Rush Street meets State Street in the heart of this
city's glitzy entertainment district.
   ``I like this place. It's clean, it's bright and it's
different,'' said Patrick A. Connolly, 67, a Chicago financier who
was smoking a foot-long cigar but carrying a couple of Nathan's
regular-sized franks on Wednesday night. ``The taste is out of this
world.''
   Connolly said he can afford the posh eateries in the
neighborhood, but prefers the dogs at Nathan's.
   Barry Potekin, co-owner of downtown's Gold Coast Dog, has
challenged Nathan's to a hot dog taste test.
   ``They called themselves the Gucci of hot dogs. That ticked us
off. What is this, perfume?'' he asked.
   Bob Hardison is caught between the dog soldiers of each side.
He's a Chicagoan, but manages the city's first Nathan's.
   ``I like both styles,'' he insisted diplomatically.
   The New York style, he explained, is with mustard and
sauerkraut, while Chicago style is with mustard, relish, onions,
tomatoes, peppers and just about anything else that will fit on the
bun.
   Not wanting to choose sides, Nathan's has a condiment bar for
customers to choose their own fixings.
   There's also a difference in the way the two dogs are cooked.
   Nathan's frank is prepared on a griddle, while Chicago's dogs
are usually boiled in water.
   Nathan's dogs are ``more intense and spicier, but not altogether
more pleasant'' than Chicago's dogs, said Tribune food critic Phil
Vettel.
   But Wednesday night, a 50-year-old man remembered bygone dogs
and said that neither city's product was, frankly, worth sniffing
at.
   ``The best hotdog place was Dave's at Homan and Roosevelt when I
was 8,'' said Harvey Shapiro, a messenger service employee. ``It
was 20 cents for a hotdog and an Orange Crush!''

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
European trading today.
   Gold was quoted nominally softer.
   The dollar lost ground against the yen in Tokyo today, closing
at 144.72 yen, down 0.78 yen from Thursday's close of 145.50 yen.
Later in London, the dollar traded at 145.15 yen.
   Traders sold the West German mark for the yen throughout the day
to take profits on overbought mark positions, dealers said.
   Concerns about the implications of a proposal to unify the two
German monetary systems, along with profit-taking, helped push the
mark lower, traders said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6665 West German marks, down from 1.6872;
1.4890 Swiss francs, down from 1.4905; 5.6710 French francs, down

Italian lire, down from 1,241.50; and 1.1940 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1970.
   The British pound traded at $1.6910, compared with $1.6885 late
Thursday.
   London's major gold dealers fixed a recommended price of $418.50
at midmorning, up from $417.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $418.75, up from $417.75 bid late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 96 cents an ounce today, to close at
$417.42.
   Silver traded at a bid price of $5.34 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $5.32.

   GE American Communications Inc. has
signed a $100 million deal with nine large cable operators to
deliver television programming to homes via satellite, officials
say.
   ``This new service will come directly to a satellite dish at
your house that's about the same size as a garbage can cover,''
said Bill Fredell, a spokesman for the company, which is also known
as GE Americom.
   Fredell said Thursday the service would be a boon to people
living in rural areas who have no access to cable service.
   Cable operators will pay GE Americom $100 million to lease 10
transponders on a satellite, Fredell said.
   The deal expires in 1996, when the satellite reaches the end of
its life.
   GE Americom is one of the 10 partners involved in the deal. The
others are all cable companies, including American Television and
Communications Corp., Comcast Corp., Cox Cable Communications,
Continental Cablevision Inc., Newhouse Broadcasting,
Telecommunications Inc., United Artists Entertainment Co, Viacom
and Warner Cable Communications.
   The 10-channel service will include a set of superstation
signals as well as pay-per-view services. Fredell said the package
could one day offer direct broadcast programming, including High
Definition Television or HDTV.

   The Campeau Corp. says it has no plans to
dismantle a Cincinnati-based development subsidiary of Campeau's
Federated and Allied department store chains, which are under
bankruptcy court protection.
   Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said earlier this week that the
company planned to dismantle Campeau Development Corp. in three to
six months. The company was set up in 1988.
   ``At this time, Campeau Development Corporation is not being
dismantled. It remains a legal, operating entity,'' Campeau
spokesman Dick Wertheim said Thursday in a statement from Toronto,
where Campeau is headquartered.
   Wertheim said Campeau is reviewing the future of the development
company in light of the financial condition of Cincinnati-based
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which
sought protection from their creditors Jan. 15 under Chapter 11 of
the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
   ``While CDC is not directly affected by the bankruptcy filings
of the retailing operations, it is indirectly impacted since in
most, if not all, cases, Allied or Federated stores were expected
to be anchors or key tenants in the developments,'' Wertheim said.
   He said the bankruptcy court proceedings would delay Campeau's
involvement in planned projects such as Boston Crossing.

   Boeing Aerospace and Electronics said it would
lay off about 40 employees from its Oak Ridge, Tenn. plant because
of uncertainty about the defense budget and the future of missile
production at the facility.
   In Seattle, 32 of 105 employees also working on the expansion of
the Oak Ridge plant's missile-making capacity will be reassigned
within the company, Boeing said in a press release Thursday.
   ``In the light of recent production schedule slides and
reconsiderations of other Defense Department programs, it is
prudent for us to reassess the need for this Advanced Production
Facility,'' said Randy Mitchell, Boeing Aerospace and Electronics
vice president of operations.
   Boeing will decide by the end of the year whether it will
proceed with the project, Mitchell said.
   The facility was to produce the Short Range Attack Missile II
and T versions for the U.S. Air Force; the Sea Lance anti-submarine
missile for the U.S. Navy; and the air-to-surface Advanced
Interdiction Weapon System missile, also for the Navy.
   Earl Bowden, president of Boeing Aerospace and Electronics, Oak
Ridge, said about half the expansion facility's $200 million cost
has already been invested.
   Boeing has about 640 workers at Oak Ridge. About 90 percent of
the work done there involves commercial jetliner subassemblies.

   The stock market moved modestly higher today
following a mixed performance in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than 4
points on Thursday, added another 6.53 to 2,650.90 after 30 minutes
of trading.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of nearly 2 to 1
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 593 up,
348 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.39 million issues as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 26.38 million shares at the same
point in Thursday's session.
   Some analysts say the completion of the Treasury's $30 billion
auction of new securities on Thursday should take some of the
pressure off stocks.
   The auction ended with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds.
   The bond sale received a less enthusiastic reception than the
sales of $10 billion in three-year notes and a like amount of
10-year notes earlier in the week. But some analysts said the fact
that the auctions are over should take some pressure off interest
rates anyway.
   Rising interest rates make yields on fixed-income securities
more competitive with those on stocks, reduce chances for corporate
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy
stocks.
   Before the market opened today, the government reported a steep
1.8 percent rise in its producer price index in January, after a
0.6 percent gain in December and the biggest one-month increase in
more than 15 years.
   But analysts had been expecting a sharp rise, as the holiday
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Consolidated Edison was up &lsqb; at
26}, Philip Morris was unchanged at 39&rsqb;, Bank of New England was
down \ at 5 and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up &lsqb; at 40&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index was up 0.69 at 184.78. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.88 to 359.56.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.28 to close
at 2,644.37.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a narrow margin in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
768 up, 696 down and 505 unchanged. The NYSE's composite index fell
0.22 to 184.09.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.24 million
shares, down from 186.71 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Government Enters New Business _ Peddling Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As if the federal government didn't play a big
enough role in the credit markets, it's taken on a big new position
_ in junk bonds.
   The nation's biggest and most creditworthy issuer of IOU's will
be looking to unload a bundle of some of the riskiest paper around
following the recent federal seizure of CenTrust Bank, Florida's
largest thrift.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision ordered
the seizure on Feb. 2, saying CenTrust was unsound largely because
of ``large and mounting losses'' on its securities portfolio.
   That included $922 million of junk bonds at the end of last
September, the most recent figures available, said Kenneth H.
Thomas, who runs a Miami-based bank and thrift consultancy.
   It wasn't the first junk pill swallowed by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal agency responsible for selling assets of failed
thrifts, but it was easily the biggest.
   City Federal Savings of Elizabeth, N.J., had junk holdings of
$715 million last September and Lincoln Savings and Loan of Los
Angeles had $339 million, Thomas says. Both institutions were
seized by the government late last year.
   All told, Thomas said, thrifts now in federal hands owned $2.3
billion in junk bonds as of last September.
   How and when the RTC peddles its junk holdings could add more
angst to the $200 billion junk market, reeling lately from steady
bad news: the bankruptcy filings of Campeau Corp.'s department
store groups, a low credit rating for an RJR Nabisco issue and
heavy selling by speculators.
   ``Anytime you put $2 billion of paper in the market, it's just
one more adverse factor on the supply side,'' said Martin Fridson,
managing director in charge of high-yield bond research at Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets.
   But RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos said the agency isn't
interested in a fire sale that could only cost taxpayers more money
and unsettle the market.
   ``Everything we have is for sale,'' he said. ``It's not for sale
at any price.''
   The prospect of selling by thrifts isn't new for the junk
market. The Congressional bailout bill for thrifts enacted last
August requires S&amp;Ls to sell their junk holdings _ which totaled
$13.2 billion in September _ by 1994.
   It's unclear whether the federally controlled thrifts have
dumped some of their junk holdings since September. Katsanos said
he couldn't provide a current figure for the RTC's holdings.
   Nevertheless, Thomas said the CenTrust debacle presents the
federal agency with a new problem. Although other failed thrifts
owned junk bonds, their failures stemmed primarily from sour real
estate loans or fraud, he said. Not so with CenTrust.
   ``This is the first thrift that definitely failed, without a
doubt, because of junk bonds,'' he said.
   CenTrust owned some of the riskiest junk paper of any thrift,
Thomas contended, including those financing operations of Eastern
Airlines, Braniff, Integrated Resources and Hillsborough Holdings,
which have either filed for bankruptcy protection or defaulted on
their debts.
   Anyone thinking of giving the government a bid for some of
CenTrust's bonds must carefully research what the holdings are and
if they can be traded, said Alan Schlesinger, head of junk bond
trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Warren Greene, who runs a $12 million high-yield portfolio at
his American Investors Income Fund Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., said
he doesn't think it's likely anyone will bid for CenTrust's entire
junk portfolio because the market is so weak.
   Still, he said that weakness presents the government with other
possible buyers _ the companies who issued the junk bonds. While
some highly publicized junk issuers are in default, many are viable
companies that can book big profits and eliminate interest payments
by buying back their debt at steep discounts, Greene said.
   Some bond brokerages also could try to repackage some of
CenTrust's holdings into new types of debt securities that carry
less risk, said Fridson of Merrill Lynch.
   ``I think a lot of people are talking to them (the RTC) and
suggesting ideas,'' he said.
   Whatever the RTC decides, junk marketers agree on one piece of
advice: don't panic.
   Fridson said if the S&amp;L industry shedded its junk portfolio
gradually over the next four years, the amount it would have to
sell each year would equal just 7 percent of the average new issue
volume in each of the past three years.
   ``It's not an amount that's unmanageable,'' he said.
   Added Schlesinger: ``Sell them when you can, not when you have
to.''

<HEAD>L.J. Hooker Unit Files Under Chapter 11 to Ease Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commercial real estate brokerage and property
management division of L.J. Hooker Corp. is shutting its doors.
   L.J. Hooker International will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to
ease the sale of nine offices _ including its Atlanta headquarters
_ to Lambert Smith Hampton, a European real estate firm, the
Atlanta-based parent company said Thursday.
   The company said the subsidiary's other 10 offices will be sold
separately or closed.
   On Aug. 9, L.J. Hooker and several of its subsidiaries filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Act. L.J. Hooker International was not part of that
filing.
   Various retail properties were included in the original
bankruptcy filing, among them the B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller
department stores. Efforts to find a buyer for Altman's failed and
on Nov. 17 L.J. Hooker announed six of the seven stores in the
chain would close. The company still is seeking offers for Bonwit
Teller.
   In a statement Thursday, Hooker said Lambert Smith Hampton is to
acquire ``certain of the assets'' of Hooker International offices
in Atlanta; Beverly Hills, Calif.; Dallas; New York; Orlando, Fla.;
Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.; San Diego, and Tampa, Fla.
   The Atlanta office includes Hooker International's corporate
headquarters.
   If the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approves the sale of the offices,
the deal is to be completed by the end of March, Hooker said.
   According to the statement, Lambert Smith Hampton officials said
the transfer of the offices will give the company 31 offices and
1,000 employees, making it the largest United States-European real
estate operation.
   Ralph G. Edwards Jr., president of Hooker International, said
senior managers as well as client portfolios will shift to Lambert
Smith Hampton with the sale.
   L.J. Hooker, which is the U.S. arm of Australia's Hooker Corp.,
got into the brokerage business in December 1986 with the purchase
of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s commercial real estate division.
   The Sydney-based parent company last autumn revealed severe cash
flow problems due to high interest rates and a sagging real estate
market in Australia. The company now is being liquidated.

   Gibraltar Financial Corp., whose
savings and loan subsidiaries were seized by the federal government
two years ago, said it has filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   James N. Thayer, the corporation's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement Thursday the move was necessary to
dissolve a writ of attachment, or claim against its assets,
obtained by Bank of America.
   Thayer also said the move was prompted in part by the
government's seizure of two of the corporation's savings and loan
subsidiaries, Gibraltar Savings and Gibraltar Savings Bank, F.A.,
in March 1989.
   Gibraltar's thrifts, which together ranked as the nation's
ninth-largest, had operations in California, Washington state and
Florida. They were seized on March 31, 1989 by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, which declared the institution unsound.
   Gibraltar Financial, a holding company whose stock is publicly
traded and which hasn't any significant assets other than two
Gibraltar Savings units in California and Washington state, was not
included in the seizure of its thrifts.
   Gibraltar Financial lost $100.5 million in 1988 and $146.5
million in 1987. In 1986, it had a $43.9 million profit.

<TEXT>
   A double wallop delivered to energy and food
prices by the holiday cold snap sent wholesale inflation soaring
1.8 percent in January, the steepest one-month rise in more than 15
years, the government said today.
   The spurt in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index was
nearly triple the already brisk 0.6 percent gain in December. If
wholesale inflation persisted at the January pace, it would produce
an annual price rise of 24.1 percent.
   The last monthly increase of greater magnitude was recorded in
November 1974 during the OPEC oil embargo, when prices shot up 2
percent in one month.
   Last month's gain was even steeper than the 1.2 percent jump
predicted by most analysts.
   Economists, however, were not overly concerned. January
inflation one stop short of the retail level was attributed almost
entirely to sharp but temporary increases in the price of fuel oil
and vegetables.
   The so-called core rate of inflation _ prices excluding the
volatile food and energy sectors _ rose a slight 0.1 percent in
January, the mildest rise since July.
   Financial markets, which usually react badly to scary inflation
numbers, started the morning with a rally. The Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks rose 6.53 points to 2,650.90.
   ``Without food and energy, commodity price inflation was very
low,'' said economimst Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. ``The bad news
is the (overall) January number was incredibly high and consumers
will pay higher prices for food and energy for a while longer. The
good news is the report suggests much of the activity was
weather-related and will diminish in coming months.''
   Energy prices in January rose 13.6 percent, the biggest increase
since the Labor Department began compiling that index in 1974. Fuel
oil prices were up a startling 25.3 percent, also the biggest jump
on record.
   As refineries switched production to fuel oil, supplies of
gasoline grew short, sending those prices up 16.7 percent. Natural
gas costs rose a brisk 3.2 percent.
   Food costs, meanwhile, shot up 2.1 percent, the sharpest rise in
six years. The price of fresh and dried vegetable rose 58 percent
for the month, the largest seasonally adjusted gain recorded since
the department began tracking that category in 1967.
   Egg prices climbed 12.5 percent on top of a 9.1 percent rise in
December. Over the past 12 months, egg costs have risen 45.2
percent. Fruit was up 3.9 percent and fish rose 6.3 percent.
   The increases were partly offset by substantial declines for
other items. Rice dropped 1.1 percent; pasta, 5.8 percent;
chickens, 2.8 percent, and turkeys, 11.9 percent.
   In other categories, prices rose 2.9 percent for children's
clothing, 0.8 percent for men's and women's clothing, and 0.9
percent for home electronic equipment.
   That was mostly counterbalanced by drops of 1.3 percent for
tobacco, which had risen 2.2 percent in December; 0.7 percent for
automobiles, the result of a new round of discounting at auto
dealerships, and 0.7 percent for tires.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index at 117.5 in
January. This meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods,
which cost $100 in 1982, cost $117.50 last month, up from $111.10 a
year earlier.
   Soaring energy costs also drove up inflation in earlier stages
of the production process. The price of intermediate goods rose 1.2
percent overall, but only 0.1 percent excluding food and energy.
The price of crude goods was up 2.4 percent overall and 0.2 percent
minus food and energy.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.
   Despite the big January increase, many economists were expecting
wholesale inflation to moderate this year compared with the 4.8
percent rate last year.
   The Bush administration last week predicted inflation of about 4
percent, in line with most private forecasts.
   ``The U.S. economy is on the weakish side ... and the pressures
of slowing demand will continue to keep inflation at least stable
and possibly lower over the next year,'' said economist Samuel D.
Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. ``You might not see a
collapse in the inflation rate, but certainly an acceleration seems
unlikely.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strengthened that
impression last week when he told Congress the risk of recession
receded from last spring and inflation, although stable, was
unacceptably high. That was taken by financial markets as a sign
the Fed would not be lowering interest rates anytime soon.
   In recent years, the Fed has kept interest rates high in order
to fight inflation by slowing economic growth. It has cut rates
only when the economy seemed in danger of lapsing into a recession.
   Monetary policy-makers met earlier this week and most analysts
believe they decided to leave interest rates unchanged for now.

   The stock market turned mixed in less active
dealings this morning after opening higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than
4.28 points on Thursday, was down 6.31 at 2,638.06 after 90 minutes
of trading.
   But advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of 6 to 5
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 646 up,
561 down and 522 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.06 million issues as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 63.36 million shares at the same
point in Thursday's session.
   Some analysts say the completion of the Treasury's $30 billion
auction of new securities on Thursday should take some of the
pressure off stocks.
   The auction ended with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds.
   The bond sale received a less enthusiastic reception than the
sales of $10 billion in three-year notes and a like amount of
10-year notes earlier in the week. But some analysts said the fact
that the auctions are over should take some pressure off interest
rates anyway.
   Rising interest rates make yields on fixed-income securities
more competitive with those on stocks, reduce chances for corporate
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy
stocks.
   Before the market opened today, the government reported a steep
1.8 percent rise in its producer price index in January, after a
0.6 percent gain in December and the biggest one-month increase in
more than 15 years.
   But analysts had been expecting a sharp rise, as the holiday

   In the credit markets today, bond prices edged higher and
interest rates slipped.

Telegraph fell { to 39}.
   The NYSE's composite index fell 0.14 at 183.95. At the American

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On China Wheat Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures opened with a pop today on the
Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department USDA
announced it had targeted China for sales of 1 million metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybean futures also opened higher while corn and oats were
mixed in early trading.
   Susan Leighty, a grain-market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the timing of the USDA announcement was
somewhat surprising although rumors of an upcoming export bonus
offer of wheat to China had swept through the markets about a month
ago.
   ``It's not like we didn't have an inkling it was coming,'' she
said.
   Traders guessed the Chinese will buy a combination of old-crop
and new-crop wheat.
   The USDA announcement, which came after the close of trading
Thursday, stirred speculation that wheat will also be offered to
the Soviet Union, Ms. Leighty said.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1\ cents to 4{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.87 a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent lower to { cent higher with March at $2.39
a bushel; oat futures were \ cent lower to { cent higher with March
at $1.37 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2\ cents higher with
March at $5.67 a bushel.
   Cattle futures retreated in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures were narrowly mixed.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .22 cent lower with
February at 79.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .25
cent lower with March at 82.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 49.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .12 cent higher with February
at 50.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

   Whirlpool Corp. will close its Mount
Sterling, Ky., dishwasher plant by March 1991 and lay off most of
the factory's 650 workers, the appliance company said today.
   After a plant capacity study by Whirlpool's KitchenAid Appliance
Group, dishwasher production will be moved from the Mount Sterling
plant to Whirlpool's Findlay Division plant in Findlay, Ohio, which
already makes Whirlpool, Roper and Kenmore dishwashers and
Whirlpool cooking ranges.
   Production of built-in cooking appliances will be moved from
Findlay to Whirlpool's Oxford, Miss., plant, which makes built-in
cooking products as well as components for Whirlpool and KitchenAid.
   Whirlpool also said it will sell its Danville, Ky., plant, which
employs 1,000 people and makes Kenmore canister, upright and
central vacuum cleaners for sale to Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   William D. Marohn, executive vice president of Whirlpool's North
American Appliance Group, said the moves would improve
manufacturing efficiency and focus on the company's major appliance
businesses.
   ``Clearly these were not easy decisions to make since they
affect a number of our people,'' Marohn said. ``We believe they are
the right ones for the company's North American business long
term.''
   The moves will cost 650 jobs at Mount Sterling, but add about
300 jobs at Findlay and another 135 jobs at Oxford, the company
said.
   The Mount Sterling plant will operate at least through the
fourth quarter of 1990, and close by the end of the first quarter
of 1991, Whirlpool spokeswoman Carol Sizer said.
   Some management jobs may be transferred to other Whirlpool
facilities but most employees will be dismissed, Sizer said.
   The company will schedule meetings with United Auto Workers
Local 1562, representing the Mount Sterling employees, to negotiate
the dismissal procedures, she said.
   Whirlpool will seek buyers and hopes to complete the sale of the
Danville facility in the first half of this year, Sizer said.
   ``We will do everything we can to assure that we find the right
buyer to provide Sears with a continuing supply of superior
products,'' said Whirlpool Vice President H.W. Bowman.

   The government today announced plans to
toughen rules on the health claims that food marketers can make
about their products.
   The new policy, to be published in the Federal Register next
week, is a ``mid-course correction'' of regulations that have
allowed food sellers to make health claims since 1987, said Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   ``Only with such a consistent set of standards can Americans be
sure of the meaning of health information on food labels,'' he said
in a statement announcing the Food and Drug Administration's
proposed rules.
   The FDA's proposal would let companies make specific health
claims if they fall within a narrow range of messages concerning
the relationship between diet and health benefits detailed in
recent studies by the U.S. surgeon general and the National Academy
of Sciences. Claims outside this narrow range would be allowed only
in certain circumstances.
   ``As science finds additional links between diet and health,
these could also be included in our health messages policy,''
Sullivan said.
   The FDA used to prohibit health-related messages on food
products, but in 1987 the agency proposed a set of liberal
regulations that allowed health claims. It was criticized as being
too broad and permissive. The new proposal supersedes the 1987
proposed rule.
   The Office of Management and Budget, which reviews draft
regulations of all executive branch agencies, approved the new
policy on Wednesday without substantial changes, an FDA official
said.
   The new policy will allow health claims only about fiber and
colon cancer, fiber and heart disease, fats and cancer, fats and
heart disease, sodium and high blood pressure, and calcium and
osteoporosis, a softening of the bones sometimes found in the
elderly.
   Many scientists believe that in some circumstances, fiber might
reduce colon cancer and heart disease; fats might increase cancer
and heart disease; high concentrations of sodium increase blood
pressure; and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis.
   The new policy could take a year to be completely implemented.
   Until then, claims will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Among the FDA considerations will be whether ``the good
outweighs the bad'' in following the seller's advice, said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This might, for
example, rule out health claims for low-cholesterol food that is
high in saturated fats, since scientists believe saturated fats in
the diet are more important in forming cholesterol in the blood
than diet cholesterol itself.
   The official declined to give examples of current claims the
agency could act against under the new policy.
   However, the agency has said it has serious concerns about
cereals with husks of psyllium, which contain soluble fiber.
   The FDA also has criticized the American Heart Association's new
``Heartguide'' program to label brands it approves as ``heart
healthy'' with a prominent mark.
   The official said the new policy did not directly bear on the
heart group's action. The association had said it would review the
program plans when the new policy was published.

   If Entertainment Weekly flops, don't blame the
marketers.
   The first major weekly magazine from the Time Inc. Magazine Co.
since the expensive failure of TV-Cable Week seven years ago debuts
Monday after a marketing blitz that smaller magazine operations can
only envy.
   Television commercials late at night have invited viewers to
subscribe by phone. New members of the Book-of-the-Month Club got
offers of free issues.
   But the crowning stroke may have been during the two weeks
preceding the magazine's premiere. That was when Entertainment
Weekly tucked a 12-page supplement in its sister publications _
Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money _ and gave an
estimated 61 million readers a sneak preview.
   The supplement had a cover photo of a gun-toting Warren Beatty
dressed like Dick Tracy in a broad-brimmed hat and bright yellow
coat.
   But the best thing about the exposure was that it was free
because the magazines are published within the same company. The
only thing Entertainment Weekly had to pay for was production.
   Publisher Michael J. Klingensmith estimated it would have cost
an outsider at least $5 million for the same exposure.
   The magazine is the dream child of two aging, busy yuppies who
wished they had a single source of information on what to watch,
read or listen to on any given night.
   They hope a million or more active, relatively affluent
baby-boomers like themselves would like to find the magazine in the
mailbox every week.
   ``These people have plenty of money; what they don't have is a
lot of time. The bigger loss for them is a lost evening rather than
a lost $30,'' said Klingensmith, 37.
   Managing Editor Jeff Jarvis, 35, the former TV critic for People
magazine, said two-thirds of each issue will be reviews of movies,
records, books, magazines, television programs and videos. The
critics will give grades A to F.
   The other third will have features about entertainment products
_ where can you go to create a customized music cassette, how do
authors go about gathering material and how has the threat of
censorship affected the television business.
   What you won't find is gossip about celebrities' personal lives.
``If you want to find out about a star's wedding or divorce, go to
People. We'll tell you about their movie,'' Jarvis said.
   Magazine consultant Martin S. Walker wonders whether
Entertainment Weekly can survive by sticking to that premise.
   ``The real question I have is can you come out with a
news-oriented weekly that is not gossip-and-celebrity-oriented and
find the audience,'' he said.
   Klingensmith and Jarvis say you can. They have spent years
making the case.
   The two men independently proposed a magazine like Entertainment
Weekly in 1984. The company, still in shock over the $47 million
loss it took on the failed TV Cable Week a year earlier, failed to
act on the ideas.
   About 2{ years ago, Klingensmith revived his proposal, noting
the growing popularity of cable and pay television, portable tape
players and videocassette recorders. The appetite for entertainment
products, he argued, was enormous.
   A Time executive took note of the suggestion and recalled that
Jarvis had made a similar proposal. He suggested the two men team
up.
   They did, and the brass liked what they heard. A direct mailing
of a prototype issue received a ``very strong response,''
Klingensmith said, and the company gave the go-ahead. The magazine
plans were announced last summer.
   Klingensmith expects to surpass plans for average circulation of
600,000 during the first year. The magazine will rely mainly on
subscriptions. The price is $51.48 a year or $1.95 a copy at
newstands.
   Despite a sluggish advertising environment, he said demand for
space in the magazine has exceeded expectations with more than 100
companies signing up.
   Klingensmith knows how badly Time executives want a winner this
time out.
   This is the company's first magazine launch since parent Time
Inc. bought Warner Communications Inc. last year, saddling itself
with debt and changing its name to Time Warner Inc.
   Time Warner President Nicholas J. Nicholas told a Columbia
University audience last fall that the company was prepared to
invest $150 million in the magazine; Klingensmith said the
out-of-pocket cash costs will be much smaller, on the order of $30
million until it breaks even within five years.
   Media critics will be watching to see if the magazine plays
favorites with sister company products such as Warner Bros. movies
or pans offerings from rival companies. Klingensmith and Jarvis
insist that won't happen.
   ``It is one of the most exciting new concepts to come along in
recent years,'' said Rich Hamilton, media director for the
advertsing agency D'Arcy Masius, Benton &amp; Bowles. ``But the reader
will tell us if it succeeds.''

   Money managers say a move by the New York Stock
Exchange to persuade big investors to report suspected program
trading abuses by their brokers is no solution to curbing volatile
price swings that sometimes afflict the market.
   The Big Board in recent months has sent letters to 100 top
institutional investors providing two telephone numbers they can
call with suspicions about big-block computerized trades by brokers
that may run afoul of exchange regulations.
   The NYSE and two futures exchanges have been investigating
suspected market manipulation involving stocks and stock-index
futures since the mini-crash last October renewed complaints that
program trading was causing trading turmoil.
   The main target of the probe is said to be a technique known as
front-running, in which traders profit on the knowledge of orders
placed with them by buying or selling stocks or stock-index futures
or options before placing the orders.
   ``There's no way in the world you're going to know it's being
done in front of you,'' Donald Dreman, managing partner of Dreman
Value Management, which handles about $4 billion in investor funds,
said today.
   By calling the exchange to effectively squeal on their own
broker, institutional investors who hire brokerage firms to conduct
program trading _ estimated at less than 100 nationwide _ would
risk losing face, not to mention business.
   ``You're going to endanger your relationship, and if there's
nothing there you look quite silly,'' said Dreman, who opposes
program trading. ``It may be a propaganda ploy to say (the exchange
is) doing things.''
   In a statement, the NYSE said Thursday that the probe of several
volatile trading days was continuing in conjunction with the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``If trading abuses are found to have taken place, the NYSE will
take appropriate enforcement action with respect to parties within
our jurisdiction,'' the statement said.
   Program traders use computer models to buy and sell large blocks
of stocks with opposite purchases of stock-index futures or options
to capitalize on brief and small price differences.
   Investigators are said to be examining volatile trading Oct. 13
_ when the Dow Jones industrial average sank 190 points _ and the
following trading day, when it regained 80 points during the course
of the day. Also under scrutiny is Oct. 24, when the market
see-sawed in wild trading.
   Exchange officials declined further comment on the issue,
including details on the letters to institutional investors
proferring the direct-access telephone numbers, dubbed a ``hot
line'' by The Wall Street Journal. The NYSE refused to say whether
the lines were set up exclusively for the institutions.
   Fund managers calling the numbers would reach the NYSE's market
surveillance department, which would analyze specific transactions
suspected of fishy trading.
   Program trading critics said the telephone lines were
insignificant in regulating abuses and some criticized
self-policing by the exchanges as inadequate to ferret out trading
irregularities.
   Some Wall Street professionals said the federal government
should unify regulation of the nation's stock and futures markets.
The Securities and Exchange Commission now regulates the stock
markets while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission handles
futures trading.
   ``That's what we need, not action line,'' said James J. Cramer,
president of Cramer &amp; Co., a small New York money management firm.
   ``It's up to the institutions to get together and say something
about it,'' said Neil Weisman, a general partner with the money
management firm Chilmark Capital Partners. ``Unless the
institutions decide not to deal with anyone doing program trading
it's not going to stop.''
   Many fund managers have complained that abuses of program
trading _ not the tactic itself _ are responsible for market
volatility and have called for a specific attack on improprieties.
   Specialists who set opening prices and manage the flow of
trading on the stock exchange floor also are said to have called on
NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in recent months to take stronger
action to curb program trading abuses.

<TEXT>
   Sematech, the computer industry consortium,
says it plans to fund an innovative project aimed at boosting the
expertise of U.S. companies in ion implant technology, a key part
of the computer chip-making process.
   The Austin consortium, which over the past year has spent
millions of dollars on joint development contracts with U.S.
semiconductor equipment companies, said the program involves Ion
Implant Services of Sunnyvale, Calif., and Genus Inc., an equipment
manufacturing firm in Mountain View, Calif.
   Under the deal, announced Thursday, Sematech bought a $2.4
million ion implanting machine from Genus and plans to lease it to
Ion Implant Services for two years.
   In turn, the Sunnyvale company will house and service the
machine at its headquarters and make it available to any other U.S.
high-tech company.
   The companies, particularly chip makers and semiconductor
equipment manufacturers, will use the machine as a test site for
high-energy implantation, and Sematech will pass on the information
gleaned from the process to its dues-paying member companies, the
consortium said.
   Ion implantation is used to alter the quality of silicon used in
computer chips.

<HEAD>Sock Retailer Posts Loss of $4.9 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sock Shop International PLC on Friday reported a
loss of 2.9 million pounds, or $4.9 million, for the first six
months of its fiscal year, blaming London's 14 weeks of
transportation strikes last summer.
   Thirty of the retailer's stores are in or near London's subway
stations, and the company was forced to close them during the
walkouts.
   Sock Shop also cited mild weather in Britain, which dampened
demand for warm socks and tights, and high interest rates, which
discouraged consumer spending and raised the company's borrowing
costs. It said it also expects to post a loss for the year ended
Feb. 28.
   A Sock Shop spokesman, who wasn't identified in keeping with
British practice, said the company would hold a special
shareholders meeting shortly to discuss the situation.
   The directors already were engaged in active negotiations on
possible refinancing, the outcome of which would be notified to
shareholders as soon as possible, he said.
   In December, Sock Shop closed its 17 U.S. stores, most of which
are in New York City. It cited disappointing sales coupled with
high rents and security costs. The company said it is holding talks
with a U.S.-based potential investor to revive its American
business.
   It operates another 109 outlets in Britain and 16 elsewhere in
Europe.
   The after-tax loss for the six months ended Aug. 31 compared
with an after-tax profit of 400,000 pounds, or $676,000, in the
same period a year earlier. On a per share basis, the prior year's
profit came to 1.8 pence, or 3 cents.
   Sales rose 38 percent to 15.3 million pounds, or $26 million,
from 11.1 million pounds, or $19 million the year before.
   The company said there would be no half-year dividend and no
likelihood of a final dividend at the end of the financial year.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Floating black globs of crude
oil and brown foam splashed ashore today as winds drove strips of a
quarter-million-gallon spill onto golden beaches beloved by surfers
and sun worshipers.
   About 2,000 residents called city hall to volunteer to help 300
professionals start cleaning up the mess, Mayor Thomas J. Mays said.
   ``We were on our knees scooping up the oil and putting it into
bags,'' said Steve Brick, one of the volunteers who showed up
before dawn today. ``The oil was seeping down into the sand; our
hands were just black when we finished.''
   The 811-foot tanker American Trader carried 21 million gallons
when its single-wall hull was punctured, apparently by an anchor,
as it approached an oil pipeline mooring about 1{ miles offshore
Wednesday night.
   The tanker lost between 250,000 and 300,000 gallons of oil from
a forward compartment that held 1,386,000 gallons, Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy said.
   When the leak stopped Thursday night, the Coast Guard began
pumping the remaining oil and water from the compartment onto a
barge. By 6 a.m. today about 26,000 gallons had been transferred,
said Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver.
   Ten skimming boats worked on the slick, which covered water over
an area roughly measuring 6 miles by 4 miles. Seas were calm and
winds light.
   ``The weather has cooperated,'' Kennedy said.
   Offshore winds Thursday had kept the slick away from beaches
until afternoon, when they reversed direction and began nudging the
mess onto shore. Pockets of crude oil began washing ashore Thursday
night.
   A 4-mile stretch was fouled in Newport Beach, an affluent
community that boasts some of Southern California's most expensive
beachfront property.
   The oily goop washed ashore along a mile-long expanse north of
Huntington Pier on Bolsa Chica State Beach, which borders a
sensitive estuary habitat, officials said.
   More oil hit along a quarter-mile-long stretch of beach south of
the pier, renowned from references in Beach Boys surf songs and its
use in films as a surfing set.
   At least eight oil-coated sea birds were found in the fouled
surf early today, said Newport Beach lifeguard Eric Bauer.
   Altogether, about 50 oiled seabirds have been found, and about
half that number had died as of this morning, Kennedy said. At
least one California brown pelican was among the dead birds.
   John Richards of Newport Beach and his fiancee found one of the
birds.
   ``He was floating in the surf area and he washed up, and then he
tried to fly away and he just flopped over,'' Richards said.
   Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost said American Trader's
hull apparently was punctured when it hit something on the bottom
as the crew prepared to hook up to an underwater pipeline that
carries crude oil to shore. It was unclear if the tanker hit one of
its own anchors or a buoy anchor, he said.
   The ship had been chartered by British Petroleum Oil Shipping
Co. USA to deliver Alaskan North Slope crude oil to the Golden West
Refinery in Santa Fe Springs.
   The ship, owned and operated by American Trading Transportation
Co. Inc. of New York, was maneuvering to a mooring before pumping
its load ashore via the refinery pipeline, said company president
Sanford Schmidt.
   The seas and weather were calm at the time of the accident.
   Federally mandated alcohol tests given to the ship's captain,
Robert La Ware, the pilot, the first mate and the second mate all
came back negative, the Coast Guard said. Drug test results were
not complete.
   Yost described the spill as major.
   ``The Coast Guard is taking this very seriously as are the
people of this region, and we're going to see you get a good
cleanup here,'' Yost said.
   Mays said the Huntington Beach cleanup largely would be done
with shovels, rakes and garbage bags. In Newport Beach about a
dozen employees of a private cleanup company stood at water's edge
overnight, using a spongy material to mop up the oil globules
floating in on the waves.
   The tanker, still about 1{ miles off the coast, was surrounded
by an oil containment boom.
   Six oil-recovery boats worked to mop up the slick in calm seas
Thursday and eight more were scheduled to start work today. An
estimated 5 percent of the slick had been skimmed by late Thursday,
Coast Guard Lt. Vincent Campos said.
   Use of chemical dispersants ``was under discussion,'' Campos
said, as officials weighed possible environmental damage from the
chemicals against harm from the oil.
   Workers laid booms to protect fragile estuaries at the Santa Ana
River mouth, Anaheim Bay, Bolsa Chica Wetlands and upper Newport
Bay _ all scenic wildlife havens. The Seal Beach National Wildlife
Refuge, which is farther north along the coast, was being monitored.
   John Turner, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
said the oil posed a hazard to such endangered creatures as the
peregrine falcon, brown pelican and light-footed clapper rail.
   The cleanup will be paid for by American Trading or its
insurance company, said British Petroleum spokesman Chuck Webster.
   Huntington Beach is a city of 180,000 about 35 miles southeast
of Los Angeles. Newport Beach, about five miles down the coast, has
about 70,000 residents.

   The U.S. dollar strengthened marginally against
major currencies except the West German mark and British pound in
European trading Friday. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said dollar trading was secondary to
activity in marks, pounds and Japanese yen.
   Mark Sexton, senior dealer at the bank of Montreal, said that as
the pound gained on the mark the British currency looked the
``safest to be in right now,'' with Britain's high 15 percent bank
base lending rate seeming likely to continue for some time.
   Traders said there had been euphoria over the mark because of
the upheavals in Eastern Europe but more realism had now set in
amid confusion over the possible merging of the currencies of the
two Germanys.
   The markets could not decide whether an unexpectedly sharp rise
of 1.8 percent in U.S. producer prices in Janaury would result in
an increase in U.S. interest rates.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6930 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6885.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, with trading quiet the dollar fell to 144.72
yen from 145.50 late Thursday. In London late Friday the dollar
traded higher at 145.20 yen.
   Other late dollar rates Friday compared with Thursday's late
levels were: 1.6750 West German marks, down from 1.6872; 1.4935
Swiss francs, up from 1.4905; 5.6765 French francs, up from 5.6725;
1.8835 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8810; 1,242.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,241.50; and 1.1987 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1970.
   Gold in London traded late at a bid price of $415.75 a troy
ounce, down from $417.75. The Zurich late bid was $416, also down
from $417.75. In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $419.15, up
from $418.15.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.25 a troy ounce, down
from Thursday's late bid of $5.32.

   The stock market pushed higher this afternoon in
sluggish dealings as interest rates slipped.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than
4.28 points on Thursday, was up 6.53 at 2,650.90 with two hours
left in the session.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of 7 to 6 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 750 up, 627 down
and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 102.13 million issues as of 2
p.m. EST compared with 132.64 million shares at the same point in
Thursday's session.
   The market opened higher, but then pulled back even as bonds
advanced. Prices rallied again in the afternoon.
   Some analysts say the completion of the Treasury's $30 billion
auction of new securities on Thursday should take some of the
pressure off stocks.
   The auction ended with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds,
which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of $10
billion in three-year notes and a like amount of 10-year notes
earlier in the week.
   But some analysts said the fact that the auctions are over
should take some pressure off interest rates anyway.
   Rising interest rates make yields on fixed-income securities
more competitive with those on stocks, reduce chances for corporate
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy
stocks.
   Before the market opened today, the government reported a steep
1.8 percent rise in its producer price index in January, the
biggest one-month increase in more than 15 years.
   But analysts had been expecting a sharp rise, as the holiday
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring.
   Bond prices edged higher in the credit markets today and
interest rates slipped.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris was up &lsqb; at 39{,
Chase Manhattan was down } at 28 and Bank of New England was down \
at 5.
   Among the blue-chip issues, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was
down \ at 40, IBM was off &lsqb; at 102| and General Electric was up {
at 63{.
   The NYSE's composite index was up 0.40 at 184.49. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up 2.22 at
359.90.

   Silently the hunter banked left and spotted her
prey. She moved closer and struck.
   ``Could I have a one-pound fillet of shark?'' Maria Suarez asked
the seafood clerk at a Miami market. ``And do you have any lemons?''
   Sharks, feared kings of the ocean food chain, are increasingly
ending up as dinner meat in your local supermarket chain. They've
become a main course for Americans who have discovered the fish to
be inexpensive but tasty.
   In addition, the expansion of trade with China since the
mid-1980s dramatically boosted demand for Atlantic and Gulf shark
fins, used for a soup considered an Asian delicacy.
   But a nearly six-fold increase in shark catches since 1985 has
alarmed environmentalists, who fear populations are dwindling to
dangerously low levels off the Southeast coast. Despite their
ferocious image, many sharks perform a useful function, cleaning
the sea floor and controlling other fish populations. Federal
officials are drafting a proposal that would limit catches and
could temporarily ban shark fishing.
   Unlike other fish, sharks reproduce slowly and may take up to 15
years to mature. In areas of intensive fishing, it could require up
to 30 years for the shark population to recover, said Jose Castro,
a shark specialist at the National Marine Fisheries Service in
Miami.
   The proposed regulations, which may take effect this summer,
would limit the U.S. commercial harvest to the 1988 level of about
12.76 million pounds, up from 2.13 million pounds in 1985. The
draft proposal also seeks to outlaw the practice of capturing
sharks only for their fins.
   Florida and Alabama account for about 80 percent of the nation's
commercial shark catch.
   The catch limit will probably already be reached if the
regulations take effect in late July or August, said Lt. Eric Hawk,
an official at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who
is helping draft the final plan.
   ``Whether you call it retroactive to January or an all-out ban,
commercial shark fishing will probably close the day the rules go
into effect,'' said Hawk.
   Meanwhile, federal officials will study shark populations and
revise the regulations for the summer of 1991, he said.
   ``They are beautifully adapated in their environment,'' said
Castro. ``But they haven't had time to adapt to this new predator
in the sea, which is man.''
   Most are caught on baited hooks connected to cables stretching
for miles behind fishing boats. The most prized species for meat
include the sand bar, mako and thresher sharks, said Wayne Swingle,
executive director of the Tampa-based Gulf of Mexico Fishery
Management Council.
   Some species, such as hammerheads, often have bloody,
unappetizing meat and may be used only for their fins, he said.
   ``We were promoting shark back in the early '80s when it was
something real unusual,'' said Donna Florio, seafood marketing
director at the South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Resources
Department. ``Now, we don't have to do too much. People are
learning about shark and are not afraid to eat it. Cost is a big
factor.''
   Shark meat brings fishermen about 65 cents a pound and shark
fins about $10 a pound, said fisherman John Bonnell of Madeira
Beach, the hub of Florida's Gulf Coast shark fleet.
   But Bonnell said he believes the proposed regulations could
drive shark fishermen out of business and force U.S. seafood
retailers to turn to Mexico, and perhaps Cuba, as main suppliers.
   ``Why would they come to us if we can only fish for half the
year when Mexico can provide them all the shark they want all year
round?'' said Bonnell, a former grouper fishermen who refitted his
boats for shark years ago.
   Bonnell and other shark fishermen are calling for officials to
wait at least a year before making regulation proposals.
   ``We're not totally against regulation, but so little is known
about the effects on the sharks that we should wait until better
data is collected,'' said Bonnell. ``We would be the first to
recognize a collapse in the shark population and we've seen no
decrease in the number or size of our catch.''
   In the shark-fin market, high-flying profits have dipped since
Chinese-U.S. relations cooled because of Beijing's violent
suppression of a pro-democracy movement in June, but Gulf shark
fins remain the most prized in the world, said Sonya Girard, a
shark fin dealer in Golden Meadow, La.
   The U.S. fins are sought because of the high content of a
noodle-like substance in species such as lemons and blues, whose
fins can retail for more than $20 a pound dried.
   ``The noodles are like pasta and come in all different sizes,
from thick like linguine to angel hair,'' said Ms. Girard, who once
received $300 worth of shark fins in the mail from a fisherman.
   Ms. Girard noted sharks have non-culinary uses ranging from
cancer research to an aphrodisiac made from ground backbone
cartilage favored by Japanese geishas.
   In the 1940s, shark livers provided a high source of vitamin A,
which now can be made synthetically.
   Like many in the shark trade, Ms. Girard doubts the practice of
``finning'' is as common as portrayed during public hearings on the
proposed federal regulations last year.
   ``It's an emotional issue,'' she said. ``I don't think too many
fishermen are going to cut off the fins and dump $800 worth of meat
back into the sea.''
   Sid Preskitt at Trans Ocean Inc. shark fin dealers in Port
Orange, Fla., attributed the growing popularity of shark meat to
better knowledge by fishermen on how to process the fish.
   To be edible, sharks must be caught alive and the tail and head
severed immediately to allow drainage of blood, which contains a
high urea content and turns to ammonia quickly after the shark
dies. The carcass is then submerged in a cold brine solution that
leaches out more blood.
   ``Shark is something a little different to eat and it's cheap,''
said Ms. Girard. ``It's become a real yuppie food.''

stage an ice show Sunday on a rink in New York's Central Park.
   The show featuring costumed professionals on loan from the Ice
Capades is one of the gimmicks planned for this year's Toy Fair, an
annual outpouring of hyperbole to stoke enthusiasm for new
creations and old favorites.
   Toymakers spare no expense or imagination in dreaming up
attention-grabbing stunts for the annual 10-day event in New York.
   ``This is show biz. This is a fun industry and this sets a tone
of fun, excitement and adventure,'' said Frank Reysen Jr., editor
of Playthings magazine, a trade publication.
   Publicity also is serious business for a multibillion-dollar
industry in which companies rely on the capricious tastes of
children. At the trade exhibition, manufacturers try to hook buyers
from all over the country scouting for inventory that will move off
store shelves quickly.
   Toy Fair visitors _ who must be members of the trade or media
and at least 18 years old _ typically encounter clowns, actors
dressed as cartoon characters, real movie stars, sports celebrities
and outlandish creatures.
   This year a fierce but environmentally friendly intergalactic
ninja named Zen will debut, as will a 12-foot ``BRIKasaurus Tex,''
a dinosaur replica built from BRIK Toy Co. blocks. Another company
plans to assemble the world's biggest crossword puzzle with the
help of 50 schoolchildren.
   Hasbro Inc. will have on hand the New Kids on the Block to pitch
a new doll line modeled on the singing fivesome.
   Super models Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson and Cheryl Tiegs
will show up to plug high-fashion dolls from Matchbox Toys (USA)
Ltd.
   Anniversaries are planned for some old-timers in toyland. Etch A
Sketch will be feted for turning 30 by Ohio Art Co. while Tonka
Corp. will pay tribute as its Mighty Tonka Truck line rumbles into
year 25.
   Barbie, who celebrated her 30th birthday last year with much
fanfare, will add a new career in 1990. At a black-tie gala Monday
night, Mattel Inc. will announce that the darling of the doll world
will become an ambassador of international goodwill.
   Mattel will outline plans to sponsor the ``Barbie Summit,''
designed to bring children together from different countries to
talk about world issues. To add drama, the company has flown to New
York a 6-year-old East German girl, Anika Polzin, who had been
photographed clutching a new Barbie on her first visit recently to
West Germany.
   The most tongue-in-cheek publicity pitch may be delivered by the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles courtesy of Playmates Toys Inc. The
figures are based on a comic about four pet turtles endowed with
human proportions after they were doused by a mutagen chemical in a
sewer. They learned Ninja ways from a martial arts master mutated
into a giant rat.
   The turtles, fighting for life, liberty and the pursuit of
pizza, their favorite food, will appear around New York. The
skating show, an Easter Seal benefit, will be followed by a Meet
the Mutants autograph session.
   Industry gimmicks concocted to beseech the press for publicity
reached new levels this year. An actor in a turtle costume peddling
free pizza was dispatched Friday to woo reporters who will be
covering Toy Fair.
   A small party of the turtles and their foes were to troop around
the streets of Manhattan on Monday. A local radio station plans to
interview Wall Street brokers for reaction to New York's first
mutant parade.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., also is aggressively promoting its line spun off from the
upcoming Dick Tracy movie. The film, starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna, opens June 15.
   One hundred pairs of personalized handcuffs were sent to members
of the media. To get the keys, reporters must show up at the
Playmates showroom during the fair.
   About 350 reporters received ``talking'' invitations to see the
Dick Tracy stuff. Cards of walkie-talkie wrist telephones, costing
$8.50 a pop, contained sophisticated circuitry that summoned
individual reporters by name to the Playmates showroom.
   Why go to such trouble?
   ``This is really the only chance of impressing and reaching the
toy buyers about your product line,'' said Timothy Unger, a public
relations executive handling the Playmates account.
   With hundreds of exhibitors at Toy Fair, he said. ``it's very
important that you add as much pizazz as possible to your program.''

   Stocks fell in nervous trading on London's Stock
Exchange Friday, as investors worried over the prospect of rising
inflation in Europe.
   With the threat of an interest rate hike in West Germany to cool
inflation, London equities became unsettled.
   Equity analysts said the London market's recent stability has
been based on the assumption that British interest rates would not
rise any further.
   But if the West German Bundesbank hiked it interest rates,
Britain likely would too.
   ``Caution has become the watchword,'' said a director at a
brokerage firm. ``When you get the possibility that the cornerstone
of Western Europe might shove its interest rates higher in what
could be a destabilizing move, it's right that people take cover.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 17.4 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,313.6, compared with a
session high of 2,323.9 and an early afternoon low of 2,308.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 14.6 points at
1,830.7 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 8.54
points to close at 1,260.56.
   Volume totaled 521.4 million shares, compared with 458.0 million

<HEAD>Braniff Seeking to Sell Three Gates in Orlando</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. is asking a federal bankruptcy
court for permission to sell its three passenger gates at Orlando
International Airport to Midway Airlines for $2.25 million.
   Braniff, based in Orlando, has been trying to raise cash by
selling assets since Sept. 28, when it filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.
   Part of the money from the gate sale would be set aside to pay
some $400,000 which Braniff owes the Greater Orlando Aviation
Authority, officials said.
   Braniff, which has stopped flying and laid off nearly all of its
4,800 employees, has survived on court-approved cash infusions from
a dwindling bank account and the sale of aircraft parts, landing
slots and passenger gates at other airports.
   Rodney May, a lawyer for the aviation authority, said he
believes the sale of the three gates to Chicago-based Midway will
be approved.
   ``They've done the deal. The aviation authority is going to get
an airline in those gates and is getting paid. That's the result we
wanted to achieve,'' May said Thursday.
   Midway now subleases two gates at the Orlando airport from Trans
World Airlines. Midway has operated between Orlando and Chicago
since 1984.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by the
Agriculture Department's offer to subsidize sales of 1 million
metric tons of wheat to China.
   The USDA announcement, which came after the close of trading
Thursday, stirred speculation that subsidized wheat also will be
offered to the Soviet Union, said Susan Leighty, a grain-market
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   She said rumors of upcoming export bonus offers to both nations
had circulated in the markets in the past month.
   Under a program designed to increase export sales of U.S. grain,
the USDA provides grain or grain credits to exporters who sell
grain to targeted nations.
   The near-month wheat contract, for delivery in March, rallied
most strongly amid speculation that the Chinese would take some
old-crop wheat in addition to new-crop, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent lower to 4{ cents higher

   The stock market posted some modest gains this
afternoon in sluggish dealings as interest rates slipped and
investors took a favorable view of an inflation report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than
4.28 points on Thursday, was up 3.38 at 2,647.75 with one hour left
in the session.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of 8 to 7 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 781 up, 663 down
and 494 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 119.11 million shares as of 3
p.m. EST compared with 151.31 million shares at the same point in
Thursday's session.
   The market opened higher, but then pulled back even as bonds
advanced. Prices rallied again in the afternoon.
   Some analysts say the completion of the Treasury's $30 billion
auction of new securities on Thursday should take some of the
pressure off stocks.
   The auction ended with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds,
which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of $10
billion in three-year notes and a like amount of 10-year notes
earlier in the week.
   But some analysts said the fact that the auctions are over
should take some pressure off interest rates anyway.
   Rising interest rates make yields on fixed-income securities
more competitive with those on stocks, reduce chances for corporate
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy
stocks.
   Before the market opened today, the government reported a steep
1.8 percent rise in its producer price index in January, the
biggest one-month increase in more than 15 years.
   But analysts had been expecting a sharp rise, as the holiday
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring.
   Bond prices were up as much as $8 for every $1,000 in face value
in the credit markets today and short-term interest rates fell.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris was up &lsqb; at 39{,
Chase Manhattan was down } at 28 and Bank of New England was down \
at 5.
   Among the blue-chip issues, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was

   The NYSE's composite index was up 0.30 at 184.39. At the

<TEXT>
   Surveillance responsibilities for the national
over-the-counter stock market were switched to New York briefly on
Friday after the National Association of Securities Dealers
headquarters were evacuated following a bomb threat.
   The NASD, which oversees the OTC market and maintains a national
price quotation system for over-the-counter stocks, evacuated its
office buildings in downtown Washington and Rockville, Md.,
spokesman Robert Ferri said.
   The Washington-area operations are responsible for market
surveillance, including monitoring of trading for signs of improper
activity. Surveillance was conducted from the association's New
York offices during the hour the buildings were evacuated.
   Ferri said trading on NASD's automated quotation system, known
as NASDAQ, was unaffected by the incident and workers in Washington
and Rockville returned to their desks at 12:30 p.m. about an hour
after the evacuation.
   Ferri said an unidentified male caller said there was a bomb in
the building, although no direct threat was made against the NASD.
   No device was found at either location.
   Ferri said both buildings were evacuated because the call was
received at a switchboard in Rockville that also serves the
Washington office.
   A spokesman for the Montgomery County Police, Sgt. Harry
Geehreng, said officers using a bomb sniffing dog searched the
building in Rockville.
   Stocks traded over-the-counter generally represent smaller
companies or newer, startup businesses without a substantial
financial history.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More dismal news from Wall Street: The nation's
leading brokerages made 21 percent less money underwriting stocks
and bonds in 1989 than the year before, figures released Monday
show.
   The total dollar volume and number of underwritings also fell
sharply last year, and analysts expect firms to slash underwriting
staffs to cope with the 1990s climate of conservatism following the
1980s boom.
   ``With lower levels of revenue and outlook for smaller dollar
volume of business, chances are you could see departments trim back
10 to 15 percent (in 1990),'' said veteran industry analyst Perrin
Long of Lipper Analytical Services.
   Wall Street already has begun retrenching in other areas of the
securities business, with a number of major firms laying off
thousands of workers across the board in recent months.
   In underwriting, investment firms acquire new stocks and bonds
issued by corporations that are seeking to raise money and sell
them to the investing public. The firms charge companies a
percentage of the offer price, in the range of 6 percent on stocks
and less than 1 percent on bonds.
   In an apparent attempt to stanch some of the underwriting
business decline and to compete in a weak market, Wall Street firms
last year cut back the average fee they charged to issue stocks and
bonds for corporate clients, according to data compiled by IDD
Information Services.
   But even that didn't help drum up much new business.
   For the full year, total underwriting fee revenue declined $811
million, or 20.9 percent, to $3.07 billion from $3.88 billion in
1988, IDD reported. The average fee as a percentage of dollar
volume shrank to 1.59 percent from 1.71 percent.
   Fees from debt issues fell by 16 percent in 1989 and from all
common stock issues by about 30 percent, IDD said.
   The biggest declines last year were in the area of initial
public stock offerings by companies, with fees plummeting about 43
percent to $889 million from $1.56 billion in 1988. A slowdown in
stock market activity was the primary reason for the drop.
   ``It's an expensive proposition to float new equity,'' Long
said. ``Obviously you didn't have many new IPOs because the market
wasn't doing anything.''
   Money made from selling new issues of high-yield, low-grade junk
bonds shrank about 14 percent to $795 million from $923 million,
IDD said. Analysts attributed that drop to the virtual collapse in
the junk bond market in the second half of 1989, when several
companies scrapped large planned debt offers.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was the overall leader in
underwriting fees, reaping $448 million, or 14.6 percent of the
market. In second place was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which made
nearly all of its $378 million in fees from junk-bond offers. IDD
did not compare the fee rankings to 1988.
   Drexel has shrunk to nearly half its size since it pleaded
guilty to felony crimes and paid $650 million to settle government
insider trading charges. The firm's share of the junk bond market,
while still commanding, is decreasing.
   For the full year, total stock and bond underwriting volume
declined by about 15 percent to $193.6 billion from $227.4 billion
in 1988. IPOs dived by 42 percent to $13.7 billion from $23.5
billion and junk bond issues fell 4.8 percent to $28.05 billion
from $29.47 billion.
   The total number of debt and equity issues also declined
sharply, to 1,452 in 1989 from 1,759 the previous year. There were
184 initial public offerings last year, down from 202 in 1988, and
125 junk-bond issues, down from 151.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. retained its No. 1 ranking, handling a total
of $46 billion as lead underwriter. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. remained
second, while First Boston Corp. moved up to third, swapping places
with Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Drexel's share of the junk-bond underwriting market slipped to
38.7 percent from 42.8 percent in 1988. But the firm remained by
far the industry leader, with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. moving up
to second place from 12th, but with just 9.4 percent of the market.

   Reader's Digest Association announced Friday

were met by Jan. 31.
   When that deadline passed, the contract was not terminated.
Reader's Digest set no new deadline for completing the deal.
   Reader's Digest will focus primarily on integrating the American
Health employees into its structure and working with advertisers,
Trachtenberg said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>New Source of Anxiety on Interest Rates: Swiss-Cheese Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many investors who are worried about rising
interest rates have focused their angst on mixed results from the
latest Treasury Department auction of new U.S. debt.
   But another source of interest-rate paranoia emerged this past
week, and it came streaming through the holes in the Berlin Wall.
   East and West Germany, which have been stunning the world with
speedy moves toward reunification, dropped another big surprise:
The West German mark soon could become the national currency of
both countries.
   Monetary union had been considered the theoretical final phase
of reunification. But East Germany's economy is so weak and its
currency so worthless that the West proposed financial melding much
sooner.
   This proposal was aimed largely at persuading East Germans to
stay on their side of the border. Otherwise, West Germans feared,
their cousins would migrate en masse, swamping West Germany's
already overburdened social welfare system and turning East
Germany's state-run economy into a rusty abandoned hulk.
   But the monetary union proposal could carry an enormous price,
reaching far beyond Germany and across the Atlantic. In an indirect
way, it could force interest rates to rise in this country.
   The reason, some economists argue, is that monetary union will
acutely strain West Germany's economy, the most powerful in Europe,
by forcing the West German government to print billions of new
marks and borrow large sums of money by selling bonds.
   To control inflation and attract buyers for the bonds, the West
Germans will have to offer higher interest rates. That will force
the United States Treasury to raise the rates offered on its debt
securities to keep them competitive to buyers looking for the best
returns.
   The new fear about the impact of monetary union injected new
uncertainty into the U.S. bond market, which had been preoccupied
with the mixed results of the latest Treasury refunding auction.
   The auctions have an enormous influence in determining U.S.
interest rates, depending on the yields the Treasury must offer to
persuade investors to buy the new debt.
   Some economists say the U.S. bond market's behavior this past
week shows how in many respects it has become a hostage to foreign
events beyond America's control.
   One reason is the large U.S. budget deficit, which forces the
Treasury to sell large amounts of government-backed IOUs to
foreigners. But another is the ease with which investors transcend
borders and move money anywhere they can earn the most profit.
   For many, Germany already looks increasingly attractive. At
current yields, for example, a 10-year U.S. Treasury earns about
8.31 percent, and a comparable 10-year West German government bond
earns about 8.28 percent. But when the higher U.S. inflation rate
is factored in, the West German bond earns more.
   ``When I started trading bonds 20 years ago, the last thing in
the world we cared about were what interest rates were doing in
Germany,'' said William Veronda, a fixed-income strategist at
Financial Group, a Denver investment firm. ``But with a more
volatile flow of funds throughout the world now, many investors
stop and say, `Gee, the real return is much better there.'''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said record price increases for vegetables and
fuel oil combined in January to produce a 1.8 percent rise in
wholesale inflation, the highest monthly rate in 15 years. But
economists were quick to characterize the rise as a temporary spurt
due to the holiday cold snap.
   _More signs emerged of trouble in the airline business. The
government said the on-time performance of major carriers was the
worst ever in December and a record number of bags were lost. Texas
Air Corp. reported a record annual loss of $885.6 million,
moneylosing Pan Am Corp. dropped hints it still was seeking a
merger partner, and Trans World Airlines pilots snubbed owner Carl
Icahn's efforts to cut the carrier's losses with wage concessions.
   _Georgia was on the minds of woodcutters and federal securities
officials. A federal judge's ruling made it much easier for Georgia
Pacific Corp. in its $3.5 billion hostile attempt to buy Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. Takeover investor Harold Simmons said the
Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating his stock
purchases in target Georgia Gulf Corp.

<HEAD>Market Outlook Shaky Despite Passage of Refunding Auction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury auction monkey is off the stock
market's back, but many observers say Wall Street still faces some
rocky moments as it tries to sustain a recovery from its January
lows.
   They warn of potential corporate earnings shocks. Rising
interest rates overseas may continue to make home-grown investments
more attractive to foreigners. And weakness in the dollar could cut
foreign demand here as well.
   On the plus side, they say inflation appears to be under control
despite a strong increase in wholesale prices in January. The
increase was blamed in large part on spikes in food and energy
prices due to unusually cold weather.
   And they say that the slowing economy may soon inspire declines
in interest rates that will make stocks more attractive.
   In a word, analysts on both sides of the fence say the next few
weeks will be _ bumpy.
   ``Getting the refunding behind us is positive for the market. It
takes away one of the negatives overhanging the market,'' said
Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at Blunt Ellis &amp;
Loewi in Milwaukee.
   The refunding auction, which involved sales of $30 billion in
new Treasury notes and bonds, had been nervously awaited by the
stock market.
   Traders feared that rising rates in Japan and other countries
would diminish the foreign appetite for Treasury issues, forcing
the government to offer even higher interest rates to sell all of
the new issues.
   But demand was strong for the three-year and 10-year notes, and
even a lukewarm reception for the 30-year bonds didn't spoil the
impression that the refunding had gone fairly well.
   Nonetheless, having the refunding out of the way does now
guarantee smooth sailing for either the stock or bond markets.
   ``We have some other clouds to clear up here,'' Czech said.
   He said the weak dollar has been ``bothering the stock market''
and has given no signs of bottoming out. In addition, he said
``disappointing earnings will be with us for a while,'' hurting
stock prices.
   He expects the market to move in spurts in a trendless pattern
over the next few weeks until ``we get a clear sign that inflation
is receding.''
   ``We are still facing a market that was wounded in January,''
said Bill Raftery, a technical researcher for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co.
   He referred to a move that took the Dow Jones industrial average
to a record high of 2,810.15 on Jan. 2 and then sent it careening
to a low of 2,543.24 on Jan. 30.
   The market has retraced about a third of the loss through
Friday's close, but Raftery noted, ``It takes a long time to heal
the wounds.''
   Rao Chalasani, market strategist for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in
Cleveland, expects rates to continue rising in West Germany and
Japan as monetary officials there respond to signs of inflation.
   In addition, he said the first-quarter corporate earnings
reports will be worse than the market anticipates.
   He said the Dow Jones industrial average could fall to the 2,400
level in the spring before declining interest rates spark an
economic pickup and provide a lift for stocks later in the year.
   This past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials showed a
net gain of 45.50 to finish at 2,648.20 by Friday's close. It was
the second consecutive weekly advance as the Dow Jones average rose
43.47 the previous week.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index gained 1.64 to 184.39; the NASDAQ composite index
for the over-the-counter market was up 6.63 at 428.84; and the
American Stock Exchange market value index rose 7.23 to 360.79, its
strongest gain since rising 7.38 for the week ended Sept. 29, 1989.
   Big Board volume averaged 154.98 million shares a day, down from
169.09 million the previous week.
   Investment newsletter writers are in their most pessimistic mood
about the market's prospects since June 1982, according to a survey
by Investors Intelligence, which studies about 130 newsletters a
week in New Rochelle, N.Y.
   Editor Michael Burke said his latest report, which covered the
week ended last Friday, found that 57.3 percent of the nearly 130
newsletters studied were bearish on prospects for the stock market,
the highest since 57.6 percent were bearish in June 1982. The
report found 29.9 percent of the newsletters were bullish, down
from 56.0 percent in the week of Dec. 15.
   Of course, some analysts view such reports as a contrarian
signal that the market may be about to reverse direction.
   ``When they get nervous, people say `Sell' very quickly. They
are pulling the trigger very quickly here,'' Burke said.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Maintenance Glitch Leaves Some ``800'' Numbers Dead for 1{
Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 200 AT&amp;T customers with toll-free
800 numbers were left without service for nearly 1{ hours Friday,
the second time in a month the phone company has experienced a
major service problem.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. blamed the latest problem on
a maintenance error.
   Customers with 800 numbers followed by the digits 424 could not
receive calls from 12:40 p.m. EST and 2 p.m., said AT&amp;T spokesman
Gary Morgenstern.
   He said as many as 200 business and agencies may have been
affected, but added that a precise figure was not available and
that the number may have been smaller.
   An 800 number is one which callers may call without incurring
any charges.
   One of the customers affected, the federal Internal Revenue
Service, reported its toll-free number, 1-800-424-1040, was down in
about half the the nation.
   ``The entire eastern half of the country was involved as far as
that toll-free situation,'' said IRS spokeswoman Phyllis Goodwin in
Newark. ``I understand it has been taken care of.''
   She could not estimate the number of taxpayers seeking
information that were unable to get through.
   The outage occurred because of an ``error in a routine
maintenance procedure,'' Morgenstern said. ``Someone failed to
follow standard procedure'' while technicians were relocating some
800 numbers from one network control point to another.
   ``These routing changes were inadvertently omitted from one of
the systems which guide network traffic,'' he said.
   He did not know where the technicians were working.
   On Jan. 15, much of AT&amp;T's long-distance network was down
nationwide for nine hours due to a computer programming error in
the network's call switching system.
   The company has scheduled a special discount day Feb. 14 to make
it up to long distance customers inconvenienced by the outage.
   Discounts of 33 percent off the regular daytime rate will be in
effect between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. that day, Morgenstern said.

   The dollar finished mixed against other major
currencies Friday in light pre-weekend trading and the soaring West
German mark lost a little altitude.
   Gold prices fell in domestic and overseas dealing.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $416.10 a troy ounce, down $2.60 from Thursday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a troy ounce of gold at
$415.75 as of 4 p.m. EST, compared to Thursday's late bid of
$418.70.
   Currency dealers said the dollar stayed within a narrow range
for most of the session as the markets wound down activity ahead of
the weekend.
   ``The dollar was basically range-bound,'' said Richard Alford, a
vice president of the Continental Bank of Chicago.
   The foreign exchange markets managed to take in stride a large
1.8 percent increase in the Producer Price Index during January.
Economists noted the wholesale inflation reading was boosted by the
severe cold snap in December; excluding food and energy the PPI
went up a barely perceptible 0.1 percent.
   Enthusiasm to invest heavily in marks was tempered by news that
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl favors uniting the two Germanys
with a common currency.
   Dealers, who had been buying marks aggressively on the
assumption that the West German economy would benefit from the
reforms in Eastern Europe, adopted a more cautious approach. There
was uncertainty about what a possible merging of East and West
Germany's currencies would mean.
   Regardless, dollar trading continued to be secondary to activity
in marks, British pounds, Japanese yen and Swiss francs on world
markets Friday.
   The dollar traded at 1.6680 marks late in New York, up from
1.6665 Thursday and also above the level of 1.6750 marks at the
close of European trading.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6930 late Friday, more
expensive than Thursday's late $1.6885. Sterling also strengthened
in New York, where a pound was quoted at $1.6955 late in the day
compared with $1.69435 on Thursday.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar began its trading day by falling
to 144.72 yen from 145.50 late Thursday. Later, in London, the
dollar traded higher at 145.20 yen but it ran out of upward
momentum in New York and closed at 144.725 yen, down from 145.315
yen Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Thursday's
late quotes, included: 1.4915 Swiss francs, up from 1.4890; 5.672
French francs, up from 5.6660; 1,241.25 Italian lire, up from
1,240.25; and 1.20025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19465.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe Friday compared with
Thursday's late levels were: 1.6750 West German marks, down from
1.6872; 1.4935 Swiss francs, up from 1.4905; 5.6765 French francs,
up from 5.6725; 1.8835 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8810; 1,242.25
Italian lire, up from 1,241.50; and 1.1987 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1970.
   Meanwhile, in the precious metals markets gold prices posted
slight declines.
   Gold in London traded late at a bid price of $415.75 a troy
ounce, down from $417.75. The Zurich late bid was $416, also down
from $417.75. In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $419.15, up
from $418.15.
   Silver prices moved lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.254 a troy ounce compared with
$5.324 on Thursday. Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.25 a
troy ounce, down from Thursday's late bid of $5.32.

   The stock market posted a small gain Friday,
drawing some mild encouragement from an inflation report and a
decline in interest rates.
   Trading activity was sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 4.28 points
on Thursday, added another 3.83 points to close at 2,648.20,
extending its gain for the week to 45.50 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
826 up, 667 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.91 million
shares, down from 176.24 million in the previous session. Volume
for the week averaged 154.98 million shares, down from 169.09
million the previous week.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.22 million shares.
   The market traded in a narrow range for most of the day, opening
higher, fading at midmorning, rallying again in the afternoon and
fading at the close.
   Before the market opened, the government reported a steep 1.8
percent rise in its producer price index in January, the biggest
one-month increase in more than 15 years.
   But analysts had been expecting a sharp rise, as the holiday
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring. Discounting the food
and energy increases, inflation was lower than had been expected.
   The report was viewed positively in the credit markets, where
bond prices rose as much as $10 for every $1,000 in face value and
short-term interest rates fell by 6 to 7 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point.
   Some analysts say the completion of the Treasury's $30 billion
auction of new securities on Thursday should take some of the
pressure off stocks.
   The auction ended with the sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds,
which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of $10
billion in three-year notes and a like amount of 10-year notes
earlier in the week.
   But the analysts said the refunding as a whole went well,
avoiding the big spikes in rates that some traders had expected.
   Rising interest rates make yields on fixed-income securities
more competitive with those on stocks, reduce chances for corporate
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy
stocks.
   Amax was the most active stock on the NYSE, finishing unchanged
at 23&lsqb;.
   Scudder New Europe Fund, a mutual fund, was the second most
active, closing at 13&rsqb; compared with an initial offering price of
12{ earlier in the day.
   Among other active issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris fell &lsqb; to
39\, Chase Manhattan was down } at 28 and Bank of New England fell
\ to 5.
   Among the blue-chip issues, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost
&rsqb; to 39~, IBM fell \ to 102{ and General Electric rose \ at 63\.
   Great Northern Nekoosa climbed 2| to 61&rsqb;. A federal judge's
ruling that just a two-thirds vote by shareholders can oust Great
Northern's directors was hailed by Georgia-Pacific Corp. as a
victory in its $3.8 billion takeover attempt.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $7.02 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.30 to 184.39.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.58 to 385.57, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.66 to 333.62.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.52 to 428.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.79, up 3.11.

<HEAD>GM, Chrysler Refuse to Rule Out Further Plant Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives of General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. declined Friday to rule out further plant closings
this year, but said temporary shutdowns had whittled new-car
inventories to reasonable levels.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith and Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald, meeting separately with reporters previewing the Chicago
Auto Show, said changes in the fickle U.S. car and truck market
could result in more plant shutdowns this year.
   Separately, Smith said he expected GM to report company-record
sales of $125 billion for 1989 next week, up by about $1.4 billion
from the previous year.
   Ford and Chrysler also report their earnings next week.
   Slow sales and rising inventories prompted temporary plant
shutdowns last month, which put thousands of auto workers on layoff
but significantly reduced new-car inventory levels
   Inventories of unsold cars now are at between 60 days and 70
days supply, considered normal for this time of year, compared with
between 90 and 100 days at the end of December based on the current
selling rate.
   In January the automakers, particularly Chrysler, trimmed
production and experienced higher-than-anticipated sales as the
full effect of buyer incentive programs announced the month before
became apparent.
   Executives at each of the Big Three automakers have said their
inventories are in line with production now, although it may not
stay that way for GM and Chrysler.
   ``We're going to have to see how the market evolves,'' Greenwald
said Friday.
   Later, Smith said he didn't see any need to close a plant in the
near future, but added, ``These are things you have to stay loose
and roll with.''
   On Thursday, Ford North American sales Vice President Robert
Rewey had said ``I believe that the inventory correction that we
planned was essentially completed at the end of January.''
   Ford is the only one of the Big Three that has not announced a
plant shutdown or large-scale indefinite layoffs for 1990.
   Chrysler shut down its Detroit subcompact car plant a week ago
and plans to close its car plant in St. Louis on Sept. 21. GM will
close its Lakewood car assembly plant in Atlanta in mid-March.
   GM and Chrysler also will be removing shifts and slowing
production rates at other plants, resulting in indefinite layoffs.
   Also Friday:
   _Greenwald said some bids had been received for its Chrysler
Technologies Corp. subsidiary, and indicated that talks about
selling the company, which includes Gulfstream Aerospace Inc., were
in late stages. However, he declined to discuss any details with
reporters and said negotiations were at their most delicate stage.
   _Toyota Motor Corp. introduced its new minivan, the Previa. Its
2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine is mounted under the front seats,
behind the front axle. Base price for the imported vehicle, which
will arrive in showrooms in limited numbers next week, will be
$13,998, said Bob McCurry, executive vice president for Toyota's
U.S. marketing organization.
   McCurry said the company expected to import a relatively modest
40,000 of the Japanese-built vehicles during 1990.
   _Smith said a decision would be made within 90 days of how to
proceed, if at all, with an electric-powered vehicle. GM first
showed its Impact electric car last month in Los Angeles.
   He said the company's options included production of the Impact,
transferring the Impact's technology to an existing car, such as
the Geo Storm made for GM by Isuzu Motors Corp., or delaying a
production decision altogether.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Hit 5-Month High On Supply Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices surged to their highest levels in five
months Friday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, fueled
by rumors of cancelled Mexican coffee shipments and other supply
concerns.
   On other commodity markets, near-month oil futures fell sharply;
orange juice futures fell ahead of a bearishly construed crop
report; precious metals slipped; grains and soybeans were higher;
and livestock and meat futures retreated.
   Coffee futures settled 2.85 cents to 3.24 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March up 2.97 cents at 85.06 cents a
pound, the highest settlement of the March contract since Sept. 21
and the highest for a near-month contract since Sept. 11, when the
September contract settled at 88.08 cents.
   The main influence in the coffee market was unconfirmed talk
that Mexico had cancelled export shipments of 350,000 to 400,000
132-pound bags of coffee, said Celeste Georkakis, a market analyst
with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   The rumors were supported by estimates that a Christmastime
freeze damaged about 10 percent of the coffee crop in Mexico, the
world's fourth-largest producer.
   ``Mexico has been withdrawing from market since the freeze and
is probably evaluating the situation overall,'' Ms. Georkakis said.
   Other constructive factors in the coffee market included a
threatened strike by dockworkers in Brazil, the world's largest
coffee producer, and perceptions that President Bush's trip next
week to Colombia will include discussions about possible
reinstatement of coffee export quotas to support prices.
   Prices for March deliveries of crude oil, heating oil and
gasoline tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange, possibly
reflecting expectations for a drop in demand for crude oil over the
next two months as U.S. refineries partially shut down for annual
maintenance.
   During the shutdowns, known as ``turnarounds,'' refiners retool
to produce more gasoline and less fuel oil to meet the demands of
the summer driving season.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 35 cents
lower to 55 cents higher with March at $21.74 a barrel; heating oil
was .24 cent lower to .61 cent higher with March at 55.08 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .25 cent to 1.61 cents lower with
March at 59.56 cents a gallon.
   Orange juice futures fell on the New York Cotton Exchange as
traders positioned for an Agriculture Department report released
after the close that contained a higher-than-expected Florida
orange crop projection.
   In its second monthly crop estimate since the December freeze,
the USDA pegged the 1989-90 Florida orange crop at 100 million
90-pound boxes compared with the January estimate of 92 million,
the pre-freeze estimate of 130 million and last year's harvest of
147 million.
   The projected yield was reduced to 1.29 gallons per box from 1.3
gallons.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled .75 cent to
1.75 cents lower with March at $1.9775 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures sank on New York's Commodity Exchange,
partly in reaction to the stock market's strength.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $3.30 lower with February at $416.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.8 cents lower with March at
$5.273 a troy ounce.
   Most grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade, supported by the Agriculture Department's offer to subsidize
sales of 1 million metric tons of wheat to China.
   After the close, the USDA released a supply-and-demand report
containing lower estimates for 1989-90 ending stocks of U.S. corn
and wheat, prompting predictions of higher corn futures when
trading resumes Monday.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 4\ cents higher with March at
$3.86} a bushel; corn was \ cent to { cent higher with March at
$2.39{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with March at
$1.38 a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 3 cents higher with March
at $5.66} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pressured by falling beef prices and a large hog
slaughter on Thursday.
   Live cattle futures were .30 cent to .47 cent lower with
February at 79.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .80
cent lower with March at 81.77 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .25 cent lower with February at 49.05 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1 cent lower with February at
49.70 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers decided at their
December meeting to further ease their high interest rate policies
due to the sluggish economy, according to minutes released Friday.
   Two days after the Dec. 18-19 meeting, the federal funds rate
dropped from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent, the sixth quarter of a
percentage point decline since the rate peaked at 9.75 percent in
June.
   Federal funds _ the interest banks charge each other for
overnight loans _ is the primary lever the Fed uses to control
short-term interest rates. It has not been adjusted since Dec. 21.
   The central bank has kept interest rates relatively high for
more than a year as it sought to decrease inflation by slowing the
economy.
   The gross national product, the total output of goods and
services, declined from third-quarter growth of 3 percent to just
0.5 percent in the last three months of 1989. Some government
officials and business leaders have urged the Fed to loosen its
grip further to stimulate economic activity.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, as the policy-making body is
called, met again Tuesday and Wednesday to review monetary policy,
but minutes of that meeting will not be released until next month.
The committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to formulate
monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed.
   It is made up of the seven Federal Reserve Board members and
five of the 12 presidents of the Fed district banks.
   ``A majority indicated that on balance they viewed the risks of
a shortfall in economic activity as sufficiently high to justify an
immediate move to slightly easier reserve conditions, and one
member expressed a preference for somewhat greater easing,'' the
minutes of the December meeting said.
   ``Members who supported an unchanged policy ... were concerned
that further easing might overcompensate for current weaknesses in
the economy at the cost of delaying progress toward price
stability,'' the minutes stated.
   In the end, the vote to ease was 9-2. Dissenting were Govs.
Wayne D. Angell and Thomas C. Melzer. One board governorship is
vacant.
   In arriving at their decision, committee members reviewed
information suggesting that economic activity was expanding slowly
in the fourth quarter with sluggishness ``especially evident in the
manufacturing sector,'' the minutes read.
   ``By contrast, growth of the service sector appeared to be well
sustained and overall construciton activity seemed relatively
firm,'' they continued.
   However, a Fed staff projection suggested the economy would
continue to slow over the next several quarters, although it would
rebound in the first quarter from the effects of fourth-quarter
strikes and natural disasters.
   As it has in the past, the committee agreed that its decision
would be subject to further adjustment depending on subsequent
economic developments.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished mixed Friday,
with near-month contracts posting losses amid concern that
petroleum supplies will exceed demand in the short term.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of crude oil, fell 35 cents to
$21.74 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract finished the week with a
net loss of $1.28 a barrel.
   Crude oil for April lost 9 cents to $21.56 a barrel, while
contracts for later delivery posted gains.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for March delivery fell 1.61 cents to 59.56 cents
a gallon, for a net weekly loss of 4.66 cents. April closed 1.50
lower at 60.25 cents a gallon, May was off 1.15 cents to 64.25
cents and other contracts had narrower declines.
   March heating oil, which lost 0.57 cent on Thursday, remained
under pressure from warm weather in the Northeast, traders said.
The contract closed down 0.24 cent at 55.08 cents a gallon. Later
contracts finished higher. April ended at 54.62 cents, up 0.21
cent, and May rose 0.61 cent to 54.06 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said prices came under pressure from industry and
government reports this week that showed an increase in crude and
product supplies in the nation's storage tanks. The higher stocks
coincide with lower seasonal demand.
   Crude prices also weakened on word that many big refineries
would slow operations for their spring overhaul in the next few
months, which suggests a decline in demand for raw oil by refiners.
   Although this week's reports by the American Petroleum Institute
and Department of Energy showed that gasoline supplies were higher
week-to-week but lower than last year, analysts said there was no
immediate cause to worry about possible supply tightness.
   Jack Baker, energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
called ``outlandish'' a news report Friday that suggested a
possible squeeze in motor fuel supplies this spring.
   ``We have less inventories than last year but more than we had
last April 1 and we're making more,'' said Baker.
   Moreover, annual maintenance turnarounds at refineries are being
done in March and April, earlier than last year and well ahead of
the peak gasoline season, analysts said. Refineries, therefore, are
expected to be pumping plenty of gasoline in time to meet spring
demand and environmental standards requiring lower-polluting motor
fuel, analysts said.

<HEAD>Gibraltar Financial Corp. Files For Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gibraltar Financial Corp. has filed
for protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy law,
nearly a year after regulators seized its main unit, Gibraltar
Savings.
   Gibraltar Chairman James N. Thayer said the thrift holding
company was forced to make the filing Thursday to dissolve a claim
against its assets by Bank of America, the trustee for the holders
of $99.5 million in unsecured Gibraltar bonds.
   Thayer also said the move was prompted in part by the
government's seizure of two of the corporation's savings and loan
subsidiaries, Gibraltar Savings and Gibraltar Savings Bank, F.A.,
in March 1989.
   The filing, which had been expected, was made under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It gives Gibraltar freedom from the
threat of creditors' lawsuits while trying to reorganize its
business.
   Bank of America obtained a writ of attachment against
Gibraltar's assets in November. Gibraltar was unable to make
interest payments because federal regulators seized Simi
Valley-based Gibraltar Savings March 31, declaring it insolvent.
The unit then didn't pay interest on debt it owed the parent
company.
   ``The company intends to continue its legal remedies against
Gibraltar Savings and the federal regulators during the course of
the Chapter 11 case for the benefit of our creditors and
stockholders,'' Thayer said in a statement.
   Gibraltar Savings had 83 branches and the sister thrift had six
branches in Washington and 18 in Florida. Together, they had $8.8
billion in deposits when seized.
   Gibraltar Financial sued regulators last June, demanding that
Gibraltar Savings return about $11 million that the one-time parent
company claims it is owed. Thayer, who has been highly critical of
the regulators, continued his attack on them in his statement,
saying the bankruptcy filing would not have been necessary if
Gibraltar Financial still ran the thrift.
   ``While the writ of attachment was the proximate cause of
today's action, the Chapter 11 filing also resulted from the
federal regulators' action in seizing Gibraltar Savings and
Gibraltar Savings Bank ... and the regulators' failure to date to
cause Gibraltar Savings to pay its debts to the company,'' Thayer
said.
   Gibraltar Financial lost $100.5 million in 1988 and $146.5
million in 1987. In 1986, it had a $43.9 million profit. The
holding company, whose stock is publicly traded, has no significant
assets other than its units in California and Washington state.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Shoot Up After Auction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose sharply Friday, rallying after
the successful completion of the Treasury Department's $30 billion
quarterly refunding auction.
   The newly issued 30-year government bond surged 1 25-32 points,
or $17.81 per $1,000 in face amount, from its level at Thursday's
auction. Its yield tumbled to 8.33 percent from 8.50 percent. Bond
prices and yields move in opposite directions.
   The jump in the price of the long bond, the most widely watched
of government securities, was the largest since last Oct. 13, when
it rose 2 9-16 points in response to a sharp sell-off in the stock
market.
   Credit market strategists attributed Friday's large increase to
two factors: relief over the completion of the Treasury's three-day
auction this week and a government report indicating that wholesale
inflation in January was low, excluding volatile food and energy
prices.
   The government sold $10 billion each of three-year notes,
10-year notes and 30-year bonds on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
The market had viewed the auctions with concern that low foreign
buying would push yields up and prices down to stimulate interest.
   The United States has come to depend on foreign investors,
particularly the Japanese, to help finance the federal deficit and
pay interest on the total public debt.
   Instead, the auction was completed successfully, with adequate
foreign interest propped up by strong domestic buying. Demand
slackened only in the final leg, the 30-year bond.
   ``There's a lot of relief the refunding is over and the auctions
by and large went well _ at least better than expected at the
beginning of the week,'' said Steven A. Wood, money market
economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco.
   In addition, the credit markets were pleased with an increase of
just 0.1 percent in wholesale inflation for January excluding a
spurt in food and energy prices due to severe cold around the
country.
   Overall, the Producer Price Index for Janaury rose 1.8 percent,
the sharpest rise since 1974. But the ``core rate'' excluding food
energy is viewed as a better measure of underlying inflationary
pressure.
   Economists said the low core rate was interpreted to indicate
that the Federal Reserve Board would not likely raise interest
rates to try to cool off the economy and curb increasing costs.
High inflation tends to erode prices of fixed-income securities
such as bonds.
   ``It's now viewed the Fed does not have to overreact to the
energy and food situation and it can probably continue to hold
policy pretty steady,'' Wood said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose &lsqb; point to 5-16 point,
intermediate maturities gained 13-32 point to 27-32 point and
long-term issues climbed 29-32 point to 1 point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, gained 6.52 to 1,166.99.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.99 percent as the
discount declined 6 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on
six-month bills slipped to 8.07 percent as the discount lost 7
basis points to 7.66 percent. Yields on one-year bills declined to
8.01 percent as the discount declined 7 basis points to 7.49
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, up from 8 3-16
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 92\, up 9-16 point. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.38 percent from 7.43 percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Creditors Committee Drops Objections to Allied Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY KINNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unsecured creditors of Allied Stores Corp.
fell in line Friday and dropped their objections to $1 billion in
new financing for the Cincinnati-based retailer.
   Lawyers for Allied and for the creditors said they agreed to a
compromise similar to the one forged Thursday by Federated
Department Stores and its creditors committee. The Federated
proposal is for $1.4 billion in financing.
   Both proposals have been submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr., who is overseeing the Chapter 11 reorganization of
the two U.S. retail divisions of Toronto-based Campeau Corp.
   Aug, who heard nearly eight hours of testimony regarding
Federated on Thursday and two hours Friday regarding Allied, said
the company's arguments on behalf of both financing proposals met
minimum requirements. But he said he would review the presentations
before signing the orders.
   Officers of Federated and Allied testified that they negotiated
the best deals possible and needed quick approval to meet a
Wednesday deadline set by the banks providing the financing.
   Federated's deal includes $400 million in operating capital and
a $1 billion financing package allowing Federated to sell credit
card debts to a subsidiary, Federated Credit Corp. The credit
division wasn't among those Campeau units that filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors Jan. 15.
   Citibank of New York heads a 90-bank group providing the $400
million.
   Allied's deal is for $300 million in operating capital and $700
million from selling receivables. Chemical Bank of New York would
provide the $300 million, and Citibank would provide the $700
million.
   ``It's a very efficient way to finance receivables. Without it,
there would not be enough to pay our bills on time,'' Allied
treasurer Mark Kennedy testified Friday.
   ``We believe it's necessary to receive approval at this point in
time. We need to keep up the vendor confidence we have right now,''
he said.
   The unsecured creditors had objected, contending that Allied
could operate a while longer without rushing into a loan agreement,
and argued that the banks would gain too much control by the
conditions they put on the loans.
   Attorney Lawrence Gottlieb said the creditors committee would
drop its objection in exchange for rewording of Federated's
proposed order to give greater protection to the trade creditors.
   ``We have a great desire to work together. We have a lot of
vendors who do a lot of business with the debtor. We just ask the
debtor to work with us,'' Gottlieb said.
   Allied agreed to provide monthly financial reports on each
division, said laywers, who continued to work out the final wording
after the hearing. Aug called it ``a productive compromise.''
   ``I hope that talks do not break down for some unforeseen
reason,'' Aug said.
   Federated and Allied listed a total of $7.7 billion in debt when
they filed for bankruptcy protection.
   The two retailers employ about 100,000 people and operate 260
stores in nine chains: Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's of New
York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati and Rich's of
Atlanta in the Federated group; and The Bon Marche of Seattle,
Jordan Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa and Stern's of
Paramus, N.J., in the Allied group.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deteriorating condition of the
East German economy, crippled by a daily drain of 1,800 people
leaving for the West, has heightened concern among officials but
both German governments denied Friday that collapse is imminent.
   A top official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, speaking
privately, said earlier Friday the decline fueled by worker exodus,
widespread strikes and high absenteeism at many industrial sites
has accelerated to the point that ``insolvency could be within a
few days.''
   Kohl will discuss the need for immediate aid in the ``billions
of marks'' (dollars) for East German neighbors during his weekend
visit to Moscow, said the senior official.
   But Bonn government spokesman Hans Klein issued a statement
later in the day saying Bonn was not officially predicting an East
German collapse.
   ``The federal government is not of the opinion that East Germany
in the next days will be insolvent,'' Klein said, but noted that
some individual leaders ``fear such extreme possibilities.''
   A spokesman for East Germany's Communist government of Premier
Hans Modrow denied the nation of 16 million residents is in such
dire circumstances.
   ``As long as the Modrow government exists, East Germany will
remain solvent,'' spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told reporters in East
Berlin.
   The senior Kohl official also said East Germany's first-ever
free elections, set for March 18, are threatened by the economic
disaster.
   ``Certain state offices don't exist any more. There are those in
East Germany who doubt that the March election date can even be
reached,'' the official said. ``The situation cannot be assessed
dramatically enough.''
   An accelerated decline would likely send more fleeing to West
Germany, which is finding it hard to absorb hundreds of thousands
of East Germans, many of them craftsmen, who already have fled
seeking a better life.
   Kohl on Wednesday formed a Cabinet committee charged with
working out unification of the two German states, including
immediate efforts to make the West German mark the common currency
in an effort to stabilize East Germany's economy. The East German
currency is virtually worthless outside the country.
   Since the October ouster of hard-line Communist leader Erich
Honecker and the November opening of the Berlin Wall, reunification
has become a major issue of debate. West Germany, with 61 million
residents, has tried to dismiss fears that a single Germany would
endanger the rest of Europe.
   In an address in the East German city of Potsdam, West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher proposed the two German
states jointly agree to issue border guarantees to their neighbors
and renounce possession of atomic weapons as a prelude to unity.
   The Communist officials still running the East German government
have reacted coolly to Kohl's currency union offer, as it hinges on
wholesale adoption of market economics.
   But East German Economics Minister Christa Luft said Modrow
would discuss the proposal when he visits Bonn next week.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl met with reporters earlier
Friday and emphasized the positive aspects of monetary union,
although he had said after an East Berlin visit three days earlier
that it was far too early to introduce hard currency to East
Germany.
   Economic union with East Germany will mean major sacrifices for
both populations, Poehl acknowledged. But he pointed to West
Germans' prosperity and glowing economic forecasts in arguing that
Bonn could afford such a bailout.
   Poehl made clear that he has strong doubts about the timing and
pace of the monetary union proposed by Kohl, and said he was
``surprised'' that the chancellor announced the plan without
talking to the central bank first.
   Economists are predicting higher interest rates and taxes for
West Germans, but Poehl said there is no cause for alarm.

<HEAD>Farley, WestPoint Pepperell Debt Downgraded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major credit rating agencies on Friday downgraded the debt
of Farley Inc. and WestPoint Pepperell Inc., citing Farley's
difficulties in completing financing for its $3 billion acquisition.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said in downgrading $1.14 billion of
Farley debt that the outlook for the Chicago-based company remains
negative. Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
about $96 million in long-term debt of West Point, Ga.-based
Pepperell and its subsidiary J.P. Stevens &amp; Co.
   ``The rating actions reflect an increasingly strained financial
position precipitated by Farley's apparent inability to date to
finance the purchase of the remainder of WestPoint Pepperell's
common stock,'' S&amp;P said in a statement.
   The New York-based credit rating agency said the problem has
hampered Farley's ability to fund the purchase permanently. S&amp;P
said the situation threatens ``the viability of the entire group of
companies unless refinanced.''
   S&amp;P noted that the pending sale of Pepperell's Cluett Peabody
unit has been delayed for several months, and the purchase price
has been reduced by $170 million, to $430 million.
   S&amp;P lowered Farley's subordinated debt ratings to triple C and
the senior debt of Pepperell to single B minus. The service also
lowered its rating for other Farley and Pepperell subsidiaries,
including Fruit of the Loom.
   Moody's said it downgraded the debt ratings of Pepperell and
J.P. Stevens to CAA from BAA3 because of high leverage from the
acquisition of Pepperell as well as the company's inability to
quickly dispose of assets as plannned.
   ``Moody's believes that the flat retail environment will make it
exceedingly difficult for WestPoint to sufficiently increase
returns on its operations to adequately support the debt,'' the New
York agency said.
   Farley acquired Pepperell early last year after a fierce battle
with the West Point-based textile company's management.

<HEAD>New Crop Forecast Slightly Better for Oranges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The picture for Florida's ravaged citrus
industry brightened just a bit Friday when agricultural
statisticians projected a slightly better orange crop than in their
first post-freeze analysis.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department revised its January figures
upward by 8 million boxes of early and mid-season oranges, putting
the overall orange total at 100 million boxes for the 1989-90 crop
year.
   If the projection holds up, Florida's orange crop will still be
one-third lower than the 146.6 million boxes produced last season,
said officials of the USDA's Florida Agricultural Statistics
Service in Orlando.
   Before the Christmas weekend freeze, the current year's orange
harvest had been projected at 130 million 90-pound boxes. The
state-federal crop inspectors said after the freeze that this could
be slashed 29 percent to 92 million boxes _ the smallest estimated
production in 25 years.
   But Friday's more optimistic forecast said the orange crop
reduction from the pre-freeze forecast may be 23 percent, or 100
million boxes.
   The estimated juice yield was decreased to 1.29 gallons from the
1.30 gallons for each box of oranges projected last month.
   Citrus Statistician Paul N. Messenger of the Orlando office said
analysts originally compared the Christmas freeze to the one in
1983 because they had been so similar in temperatures and duration,
the time of year and the amount of the crop on the trees.
   The 1983 freeze reduced the orange crop by 30 percent.
   ``It is apparent that the early and mids did not have as great a
loss as they did in the `83 freeze,'' Messenger said. Another
reason for the slight upward revision in the forecast is ``the good
salvage operations of the crop,'' he said.
   ``Utilization of freeze-damaged fruit has exceeded expectations
of the first post-freeze forecast in January,'' the USDA report
said.
   Harvesting and processing of the ice-bitten fruit is about 90
percent complete, with only a few southern areas remaining to be
picked in the state's 700,000-acre citrus belt.
   The now-ripening Valencia orange crop forecast was unchanged
from January's projection of 32 million boxes.
   Seedless grapefruit-harvest projections dropped even further,
however, from a figure of 35.5 million boxes right after the freeze
to 32.5 million. Last year's production was 51 million boxes.
   Messenger said there had been few reports of tree damage, but
extensive evaluation will not be made until this summer.
   ``Most of the trees are coming out very well, with new growth
and new bloom,'' said Messenger.
   But he and growers say such new growth makes trees vulnerable to
any further cold weather.
   Some industry officials have estimated financial losses at the
farm level at $200 million to $300 million. This does not include
loss of added value from harvesting and processing.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Arrest of Eddie Antar for Contempt of Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday ordered U.S.
marshals to arrest the founder of the collapsed electronics chain
Crazy Eddie Inc. for contempt of court after he refused to return
$52 million to the United States.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan angrily demanded the
arrest of Eddie Antar after having given him three extensions to
show up in court.
   ``I want this man brought before me,'' Politan said. ``Spare no
expense. ... This court's integrity will not be flouted by Mr.
Antar or anybody else.'' Politan issued the repatriation order at
the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which says
the money may constitute illegal profits from insider trading.
   The SEC sued Antar, who was chairman of Crazy Eddie, and other
top former officials of the chain, accusing them of falsely
inflating the company's income. The SEC said Antar transferred $52
million to bank accounts in Israel three years ago.
   Antar, through his lawyers, has denied the charges.
   Antar's attorneys late Friday sought recourse from to 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert E. Cowen in Trenton.
   Cowen stayed the repatriation order and contempt finding but let
the arrest warrant stand, said Antar's attorney, Jack Arseneault.
The effect is that Antar needs only to appear in court to remove
the threat of arrest while a formal appeal of the repatriation
order goes forward, he said.
   Politan had set a deadline of 4 p.m. Wednesday for the money to
be returned and deposited with a trustee. When Antar defied it, he
ordered him to court Thursday morning to respond to the contempt
citation.
   Antar's lawyers said he needed a 24-hour extension for personal
reasons. Politan granted the delay with the threat of an arrest
warrant if Antar failed to appear Friday.
   In an affidavit submitted Friday, Antar said he was refusing the
order because of his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Antar's attorneys have argued that merely
acknowledging the presence of the money could be used against him.
   Politan spurned the offer of the affidavit.
   ``We're not in a paper chase here. We're in a human chase. Human
beings have a right to pursue a privilege ... (but) they can't do
it by affidavit,'' he said.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Newark is seeking a criminal
indictment against the Brooklyn, N.Y.-born Antar, a high school
dropout who turned a single electronics store into a chain of 43.
Crazy Eddie became widely known in the New York area for its
frenetic commercials advertising ``insane'' prices.
   The company has entered bankruptcy proceedings and is facing a
shareholder's lawsuit.
   Politan refused Arseneault's request for a stay on the arrest
order pending appeal. He then closed the courtroom to ask Antar's
lawyers for his recent addresses and phone numbers, and his
whereabouts the last time he spoke to his lawyers.

<HEAD>Mount Sterling Plant To Close; Danville Plant For Sale</HEAD>

   Whirlpool Corp. announced Friday it
will close its dishwasher plant here that employs 650 people by
March 1991.
   ``It's going to hurt everybody,'' said United Auto Workers Local
1562 steward Frankie Allen. ``Everyone's going to suffer.''
   ``You can't find another job like that here, and certainly not
that many,'' said Bob Teegarden, who has worked at the plant 22
years.
   Whirlpool also announced it will sell its Danville plant and its
floor-care operations, but will move the plant's ice-maker and
trash compactor operation to other plants.
   The Danville plant, which opened 19 years ago, has more than
1,000 workers _ 700 in the floor-care division that manufactures
Kenmore vacuum cleaners and 300 in the making of ice-makers and
trash compactors.
   David Mitchell, vice president of the Danville division, said at
a news conference Friday that Whirlpool is optimistic it can find a
buyer for the plant's floor-care operations, preserving 700 jobs.
   ``We have over 10 percent of the floor-care business nationally,
and we have an outstanding facility and employees,'' Mitchell said.
   However, Mitchell said most of the 300 jobs in the ice-maker and
trash-compactor operation will be lost.
   Whirlpool said it will shift production of its KitchenAid
dishwashers from Mount Sterling to its division in Findlay, Ohio,
which already makes Whirlpool, Roper and Kenmore dishwashers and
Whirlpool cooking ranges.
   Production of built-in cooking appliances will be moved from
Findlay to Whirlpool's Oxford, Miss., plant, which makes built-in
cooking products as well as components for Whirlpool and KitchenAid.
   Whirlpool officials said the company could save $7 million by
moving operations to Findlay.
   Tom Reffett, president of Local 1562, said the union was willing
to make concessions in its current contract to keep the plant open.
   ``I don't think anything we could have done would have
mattered,'' said Reffett, who had worked at the plant for 18 years.
   Reffett said in small town like Mount Sterling, with about 6,000
residents, it would be impossible to replace the jobs at the plant,
which paid an average of $9.72 an hour.
   William D. Marohn, executive vice president of Whirlpool's North
American Appliance Group, said the moves would improve
manufacturing efficiency and focus on the company's major appliance
businesses.
   ``Clearly these were not easy decisions to make since they
affect a number of our people,'' Marohn said. ``We believe they are
the right ones for the company's North American business long
term.''
   The Mount Sterling plant will operate at least through the
fourth quarter of 1990, and close by the end of the first quarter
of 1991, Whirlpool spokeswoman Carol Sizer said.
   Some management jobs may be transferred to other Whirlpool
facilities but most employees will be dismissed, Sizer said.
   The company will schedule meetings with United Auto Workers
Local 1562 to negotiate the dismissal procedures, she said.

   The 1,700 Appalachia coal miners who have been
on strike since April on Friday moved closer to a vote on returning
to work as the National Labor Relations Board settled lawsuits
filed by both sides during the bitter dispute.
   Bargainers for the United Mine Workers and Pittston Coal Co.
reached a tentative settlement on New Year's Eve, but a contract
ratification vote for rank-and-file union members in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky has been delayed until outstanding unfair
labor practice charges were resolved.
   A UMW spokesman said it was unclear when miners, who have
remained off the job pending ratification, would vote on the new
contract.
   Under Friday's NLRB agreement, both sides will be allowed to
drop all charges if the contract is ratified, miners return to work
and the terms of the agreement are approved by federal courts.
   Also Friday, the UMW said it and the company would go before
Russell County, Va., Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin on Monday to
ask that he drop $64.5 million in fines levied against the union
for illegal strike activities such as intimidating replacement
workers and obstructing coal truck traffic.
   In Big Stone Gap, Va., U.S. District Judge Glen Williams also
must settle nearly $1 million in fines against the union as a
condition of ratification.
   Williams held a 90-minute, closed-door meeting in his chambers
Friday afternoon with two attorneys each from the union and the
board. After the session, Williams told reporters he was concerned
about possible public reaction were he to issue a blanket
forgiveness of the fines.
   ``I naturally don't want to do something that's going to block a
settlement,'' Williams said, adding that he was nonetheless
interested in ``protecting the integrity of the court.''
   Williams said he probably would meet again with union attorneys
Monday.
   In addition, trustees of the union's health retirement funds
also must agree to changes required by the new contract.
   Details of the contract remain secret, but sources have said the
union won on two key issues _ better health and retirement benefits
and improved job security.
   The union struck after Pittston decided to end contributions to
the UMW retirement and health plans for some 130,000 workers. The
union said the decision could cause other coal companies to follow
suit and retired miners would lose their benefits.
   Pittston, the nation's largest coal exporter, said it could not
afford the payments because of high overseas shipping costs.
   The strike was punctuated by large labor rallies, vandalism and
rock-throwing confrontations between strikers and other company
workers. At one point, some 46,000 coal workers in 10 states walked
off their jobs in sympathy strikes.

<HEAD>Appeal Filed in Family Claim To Huge E&amp;J Gallo Winery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger brother of Ernest and Julio
Gallo, owners of the world's largest winery, has filed a federal
appeal renewing his claim to a one-third interest in the $1
billion-a-year business, and arguing to use the family name on his
cheese products.
   Livingston rancher Joseph Gallo said in his 59-page filing
before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the First
Amendment entitles him to use the Gallo name on his cheese, and
that his older brothers used his inheritance to launch the Gallo
wine empire.
   The filing, made last month, is an appeal of a decision by U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Coyle last August. It held that Joseph's
use of the Gallo name on his cheese packages violated the E&amp;J Gallo
trademark. He ordered Joseph to reduce the ``Gallo'' emphasis on
labels and in ads.
   Joseph appealed to Coyle, asking for a new judge and a new
trial. Coyle denied the motions. Joseph then launched his claim in
the inheritance matter. Joseph alleged that his brothers once
included him as an equal partner.
   The stakes are huge. E&amp;J Gallo reputedly packs about 170 million
gallons of wine annually, dominating the California wine industry
and controlling more than 25 percent of the U.S. wine market.
   Joseph's claim was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Edward Dean
Price, who had removed himself from the trademark case over a
challenge of the judge's relationship with the Gallos.
   The new appeal charges that Coyle had a conflict in the
trademark case because he owned vineyards in Fresno county and was
a partner in a law firm that represented the winery in an earlier
trademark case.
   Joseph, among other things, asked the appeals court to knock
down Coyle's ruling and order a new trial with a different judge.

<TEXT>
   Peace activists on Friday urged consumers to
boycott Folgers coffee in an effort to persuade Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. to stop buying coffee from war-torn El Salvador.
   About a dozen members of Peaceworks, a coalition of Cincinnati
peace activist organizations, picketed outside Procter &amp; Gamble's
corporate headquarters.
   The activists support a coffee boycott announced in November by
the San Francisco-based group Neighbor to Neighbor, Peaceworks
spokeswoman Kateri Koverman said. Demonstrators wore blue buttons
reading ``Boycott Salvadoran Coffee: Stop Funding Death Squads.''
   A P&amp;G spokesman said the company would not change its
coffee-buying policy.
   Activists met with P&amp;G officials in December to urge the company
to stop buying Salvadoran coffee. They said P&amp;G is being targeted
because it has appeared less responsive than rival coffee producers
Hills Bros. Coffee and Nestle Foods Corp. about the issue.
   Hills Bros. and Nestle in December agreed to suspend coffee
purchase from El Salvador for 30 days.
   Boycott supporters claim money from U.S. coffee buyers enriches
wealthy Salvadoran families backing that country's civil war.
   But Procter &amp; Gamble says purchase of Salvadoran coffee benefits
workers in El Salvador. The company also says the Bush
administration and the State Department encourage open trade with
the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government.
   ``We believe the U.S. government is best equipped to make
decisions on foreign policy and foreign governments for our
country, and the Bush administration and the State Department
strongly support our country's open trade with El Salvador,'' P&amp;G
spokesman Donald Tassone said.
   He said P&amp;G buys coffee from at least 30 countries, and the
Salvadoran product amounts to less than 2 percent of the coffee
used to produce the Folgers blend.
   ``As a company, we can't let a very small but vocal group inject
us into their dispute with the U.S. government, no matter how well
intentioned it might be,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators took over the nearly
$1 billion American Federal Savings and Loan Association of Des
Moines on Friday over concern that it could not meet its capital
requirements.
   Officials said it was the largest failure ever of an Iowa thrift.
   No depositor lost any money and all accounts remain federally
insured, said Jerry Orman of the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision.
   The thrift has $968 million in assets and $828.5 million on
deposit at offices in 14 Iowa communities.
   The federal Resolution Trust Corp. seized all deposits, named a
managing agent to supervise operations and said the thrift would
re-open Saturday as American Federal Savings Association of Iowa.
   ``It became apparent with their continuing operating losses they
were going to be unable to meet their capital requirements without
some form of government assistance,'' Orman said.
   He said the thrift's liabilities exceed its assets by $28
million.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. and Office of Thrift Supervision were
set up by Congress as part of a multibillion-dollar program to
salvage failed thrifts.
   ``This would be by far the biggest takeover in Iowa,'' said
Gregg Barcus, the superintendent of the state savings and loan
division.
   Being placed in conservatorship means the thrift continues to
operate while the Resolution Trust Corp. seeks to minimize losses
and insure prudent operations. The government also will try to seek
a buyer.
   A Resolution Trust Corp. managing agent, Jerry Brandt, was put
in charge of the thrift, but Orman said no other management changes
were anticipated.
   Orman said American Federal had been experiencing operating
losses over several years as a result of out-of-state problem loans
in the early 1980s. He said no wrong-doing is suspected.

   The Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. on
Friday announced an agreement in principle to sell most of its
operating rail assets to the Railroad Development Corp.
   The sale is subject to finalization of a definitive purchase
agreement and approval by P&amp;LE's creditors and the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
   Railroad Development, which is based in Pittsburgh, is willing
to negotiate with unions representing P&amp;LE employees, but the
settlement of labor issues is not a condition of the completion of
the transaction, P&amp;LE said in a statement.
   Railroad Development creates, structures and finances
transportation companies. It is an affiliate of Hawthorne Group, an
investment company based in Pittsburgh.

   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index soared
a seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent last month, the sharpest rise

   Textron Lycoming, which makes engines
for M-1 Army tanks, plans to lay off 150 people as part of an
ongoing effort to streamline the operation, the company said.
   The jobs, almost all of them in management, will be eliminated
by the end of March. The company said additional reductions will
take place over the next two years as part of the streamlining
effort.
   Officials said the announcement, made Thursday, was unrelated to
the Defense Department's proposal to eliminate the M-1 tank.
Textron said late last month that the proposal could lead to 1,500
layoffs for the Stratford-based company, which employs 4,300.
   Textron said at the time it has been trying for the last four
years to reduce its defense-related operations, which comprise
about 60 percent of its business.
   ``We have been reviewing our business over the past several
months to assess our strengths and weaknesses, and to prepare
ourselves to effectively compete in the 1990s,'' Textron President
John R. Myers said Thursday in a prepared statement.
   ``Our traditional commercial and military markets are threatened
by increasing competition. Defense spending is undergoing
fundamental changes, and cost has become a critical element of
competitiveness,'' he said.
   Textron spokesman William McDaniel said as many as 100
management jobs will be eliminated in Stratford, as well as 40 to
50 management jobs at Textron locations in Pennsylvania and South
Carolina.
   McDaniel said the longer-range cuts would take place through
layoffs, attrition and planned retirements.

   A Food and Drug Administration proposal to
limit food health claims was praised Friday as ``a major victory
for consumers,'' but one industry group called portions of the plan
a ``bureaucratic nightmare.''
   Allen Goldberg of the Grocery Manufacturers Association praised
the FDA for moving ahead on health claims, but said the plan was
``unacceptable in its current form.''
   He called a requirement for FDA clearance of health claims ``a
bureaucratic nightmare'' and said the need for scientific agreement
on a health benefit before a claim can be made is unfair.
   ``Scientific consensus is an oxymoron,'' he said. ``We believe a
claim should be able to be made if strong scientific evidence
exists to support the claim.''
   Another industry group, the National Food Processors
Association, also said it had some concerns, but spokeswoman Ellen
Morton said ``overall our reaction is pretty positive.''
   The group's major complaint is that the plan will let states
regulate health claims, which could lead to different rules in
different states. ``Our members market their products on an
interstate basis,'' she said.
   The policy will allow some health claims to be made, but will
end what even federal officials say has been three years under
rules that have allowed overly broad and ill-founded claims.
   ``The rule is a major victory for consumers and responsible
members of the food industry,'' said Bruce Silverglade of the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   ``This new regulation probably means the end of claims that oat
bran doughnuts reduce cholesterol, that vitamin A in butter keeps
your skin soft and smooth and that B vitamins in cereals help
provide energy.''
   The proposal is to be published in the Federal Register next
week.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said in
announcing the plan Friday that it is a ``mid-course correction''
of regulations that have allowed food sellers to make health claims
since 1987, when the Reagan administration abandoned a
long-standing prohibition against such claims.
   ``Only with such a consistent set of standards can Americans be
sure of the meaning of health information on food labels,'' he said.
   The FDA's proposal would let companies make specific health
claims if the claims fall within a narrow range of messages
concerning the relationship between diet and health benefits.
   The principle reference points for scientific backup to the
claims would be studies by the U.S. Surgeon General and the
National Academy of Sciences. Claims outside that narrow range
would be allowed only in certain circumstances.
   Sullivan said that as science finds more links between diet and
health, the regulation could be updated.
   The policy will allow health claims about fiber and colon
cancer, fiber and heart disease, fats and cancer, fats and heart
disease, sodium and high blood pressure and calcium and
osteoporosis, a softening of the bones sometimes found in the
elderly.
   The American Heart Association, whose program of special ``Heart
Healthy'' labels on foods has been sharply criticized by the FDA,
said the new regulation was welcome but ``does not address all of
the important nutrition issues facing the American public.''
   The association said it was trying to address how individual
foods fit in to a healthy diet, re-formulation of foods to
eliminate excessive amounts of harmful substances, independent
testing and availability of accurate information in the supermarket.
   Despite predictions that the rules could enable the FDA to act
against a proliferation of claims about oat bran because recent
studies have thrown doubt its benefits, the proposal doesn't worry
Quaker Oats Co.
   ``We have 27 years of research showing that oatmeal and oat bran
when consumed in connection with a low fat diet will lower
cholesterol,'' said Luther McKinney, a senior vice president for
law and corporate affairs.
   But while the company is ``happy the rules have been issued,''
McKinney said he was concerned about a provision that would allow
states to impose more stringent rules on health claims.
   Texas is suing Quaker Oats over the company's
cholesterol-lowering claim for one of its products.
   The new policy could take a year to be fully implemented. Until
then, claims will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Agreement on More Italy-U.S. Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Italy have agreed to
expand air service between the two countries starting this fall,
the Transportation Department announced Friday.
   The agreement, initialed in Rome on Thursday, allows three more
U.S. airlines to fly to Italy.
   Currently, two U.S. airlines, Pan American and TWA, fly to
Italy, while Federal Express is authorized to make freight flights.
The Italian airline Alitalia also serves the United States.
   Under the new pact:
   _On Oct. 29, Alitalia may chose an additional two U.S. cities to
serve with four flights a week and seven a week as of April 1, 1991.
   _Starting April 1, 1991, American Airlines will begin daily
flights from Chicago to Milan and Rome, and U.S. airlines will be
permitted to fly on from Milan to Dubrovnik and Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
   _As of Nov. 1, 1992, the United States may designate a fifth
airline to serve Italy with five flights a week for the first year
and seven thereafter as long as the planes used have 300 or fewer
seats. Frequency of service must be less with larger planes.
   _On the same day Alitalia may serve an additional two U.S.
cities with the same frequency that the fifth U.S. carrier flies to
Italy.

<HEAD>Goldberg Takes Over Di Giorgio Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Arthur M. Goldberg said Friday that his
DIG Holding Corp. has acquired Di Giorgio Corp., a $1
billion-a-year food and building materials company, with the
purchase of 80 percent of its outstanding stock for about $124.5
million in cash.
   Di Giorgio accepted DIG's $30-a-share offer, which expired at
noon Thursday, Goldberg said in a press release. About 4.15 million
of Di Giorgio's 5.17 million outstanding shares were sold to
Goldberg, who already owned about 14 percent of the company.
   Last August, the San Francisco-based company rejected as
inadequate an unsolicited $32-a-share offer from Goldberg and urged
its shareholders not to sell him their stock. It had rejected a
$30-a-share offer in June, but that bid was extended.
   The two companies will merge, Goldberg said in his statement.
Neither he nor Di Giorgio returned phone calls by The Associated
Press.
   Di Giorgio stock, not traded Friday because of a hold by the New
York Stock Exchange, closed at $29.75 Thursday, up $2.50 from
Wednesday.
   Di Giorgio is engaged in food distribution through its New
York-based White Rose Food Division and processes and sells
speciality meats through its Cerando Division. Di Giorgio also
makes and sells a variety of building materials through its DG
Mouldings, BiltBest Windows and Las Plumas Lumber Divisions.
   DIG Holding Corp. is owned by Rose Partners L.P., a partnership
of investors led by Goldberg.

<HEAD>Armstrong Sues Takeover Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Armstrong World Industries Inc. filed a
federal lawsuit Friday accusing an unwanted suitor of using inside
information in buying and selling the company's stock, the company
said.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Reading, names
First City Fiancial Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, an
investment company primarily owned by the Belzberg family of Canada.
   The Belzberg family first targeted the floor-covering company
last summer, announcing it purchased 9.85 percent of its stock and
wished to take over Armstrong. Armstrong resisted the attempt, and
the Belzbergs have not made a tender offer.
   The family also has announced it intends to try to appoint four
sympathetic board members during Armstrong's annual shareholders
meeting April 30.
   The lawsuit asks the court to force First City to relinquish
$225,000, which, the lawsuit contends, the company made in trades
on Armstrong stock in December and January.
   As of about the end of November, First City owned 10 percent of
Armstrong's outstanding shares, Armstrong spokesman John Scheldrup
said.
   Last week, the family purchased 250,000 additional Armstrong
shares, increasing its stake to 10.6 percent, Scheldrup said.
   A call Friday evening to First City for comment was directed to
a spokesman in New York, Ned Scharff, who was said to have left the
office for the day.
   Armstrong stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$34.37{, up 12.5 cents.
