   California Attorney General John Van de
Kamp formally launched his campaign for governor Sunday in rival
Dianne Feinstein's political backyard with a scathing attack on her
record as mayor of San Francisco.
   Van de Kamp began with a rally at the Mission High School boys'
gymnasium, in the heart of the city where Feinstein served nine
years as mayor, and ripped into Feinstein's fiscal management and
her record on civil rights, insurance, the environment and women's
issues.
   ``Dianne Feinstein's budget mismanagement turned the city by the
bay into the city that could not pay,'' Van de Kamp said, accusing
her of being evasive on how she would balance the state budget.
   Van de Kamp describing himself as a candidate who ``is going to
change California'' with environmental, political ethics and drug
reforms.
   A spokesman for Feinstein called Van de Kamp's attack a sign of
desperation in the wake of the most recent poll on the June 5
Democratic primary, in which the former mayor pulled ahead of the
attorney general.
   The kickoff announcement is only a formality, since Van de Kamp,
like Feinstein, has been actively campaigning for a year and leads
Feinstein in fund raising by $4.6 million to $2.3 million.
   The winner of their June 5 primary will face the expected
Republican nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in November. Incumbent
Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, is retiring.
   Van de Kamp's campaign for governor is tied closely to three
ballot initiatives he is sponsoring on the environment, legislative
ethics and crime. The content of Van de Kamp's initiatives has also
stirred controversy. Part of his crime initiative duplicates an
initiative sponsored by Wilson, except for deletion of privacy
language which Van de Kamp claims could undermine a woman's right
to abortion, and his political ethics initiative contains a
controversial limit on the terms of legislators.
   The ethics proposal has strained Van de Kamp's relations with
legislative leaders of his own party, not only because of the
proposed limit on their terms, but especially because of a
supporting article Van de Kamp wrote in which he said of the
Legislature, ``if we want clean government, it's time to drain the
swamp.''
   Van de Kamp, 54, is a member of the wealthy Pasadena family
which formerly owned the frozen food company and the Southern
California bakery chain which still carry the family name.
   Before his election as attorney general in 1982, Van de Kamp
served seven years as Los Angeles County district attorney, five
years as federal public defender and two years as assistant federal
public defender in Los Angeles.

   Nicaraguans voted Sunday in a
peaceful, orderly manner, key international observers said.
   ``It was very fair,'' former President Jimmy Carter told The
Associated Press after the polls closed.
   The head of the U.N. 230-member observer mission agreed.
   ``I think things have been going very smoothly,'' said former
U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson. He said none of the U.N.
observers deployed nationwide had reported irregularities in the
voting.
   Carter, Richardson and Organization of American States
Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares also were monitoring the
counting of the votes.
   Observers from smaller missions said they were more than
satisfied with what they'd seen.
   ``We have been out touring polling places since 5:45 a.m. and we
haven't seen a single irregularity,'' said Guatemalan congressman
Edmond Mullet.
   Mullet was one of 20 observers from the Washington-based Center
for Democracy, which monitored the 1986 elections in the Philipines
and the 1989 elections in Panama for the U.S. Senate.
   Erin Saberi of the Southwest Voter's Registration Project said
she was impressed with the seriousness with which people exercised
their franchise.
   Political agreements between the ruling Sandinista government,
the domestic opposition and Central American countries laid the
groundwork for what has been not only Nicaragua's freest election
but also one of the world's most closely observed.
   There were so many observers monitoring the voting that one
group decided to observe other observers.
   The Supreme Electoral Council said it had issued credentials for
more than 3,000 international observers, or one for every 550 or so
registered voters.
   ``It's great for Nicaragua to have all these people spending all
these dollars,'' said Humberto S. Dona as he stood in line to vote.
   ``There are some people who say we should have an election every
year.''
   Carter, perhaps the single most crucial observer, was at a
polling place at 6 a.m., a hour before opening time, to watch
preparations for the vote.
   ``The quality is very high,'' said Carter in heavily accented
Spanish. ``We need an election like this in the United States.''
   At the Instituto Loyola, the biggest precinct in Nicaragua,
voters waiting in line mistook the horde of reporters accompanying
Carter for international observers.
   ``Observers, observers,'' people shouted. ``Let them in, let
them in.''
   They broke into cheers, whistles and applause when guards
relented and opened the doors.
   Members of the biggest observer teams, 230 people from the U.N.
and 430 from the OAS, seemed to be everywhere.
   The OAS and U.N. missions have been in Nicaragua for months as
part of a monitoring effort that spanned voter registration and
campaigning to balloting and counting the vote.
   But since neither the OAS nor the United Nations planned to
issue a quick assessment, Carter's verdict took on even more weight.
   A victory without his endorsement, he said Saturday, would be
``hollow.''
   Carter played a key role last year in Panama, publicly
denouncing election fraud while the votes were still being counted.
His group includes a dozen senators and congressmen.
   Carter, Baena Soares and Richardson, the personal representative
of U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, all praised the safeguards
in place for the voting on the eve of the election.
   One of those safeguards, a nearly indelible blue ink, turned out
to be flawed but Richardson discounted the importance of the fact
that it could be removed with laundry bleach.
   ``I don't think its fraud,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It
would have to be a pretty elaborate scheme.''
   Competing political parties also had observers stationed at the
polls and in the regional and national vote-counting centers.
   The U.N. and OAS teams include everyone from political analysts
to statisticians to communications technicans.
   The smaller observer groups span the political spectrum.
   In a scenario reminiscent of Mad Magazine's ``Spy Vs. Spy,'' one
liberal group, Boston-based Hemisphere Initiatives, decided to
monitor observers from the more conservative Center for Democracy.
   After Nicaragua's leftist government refused to issue visas for
more than a score of Center for Democracy observers, its president,
Allen Weinstein, questioned the credibility of the entire election
monitoring effort.
   Hemisphere's president, Ralph Fine, said some of his people were
observing the Center observers so they could ``set the record
straight'' if need be.

   President Bush said Sunday that ``whoever
wins the election'' in Nicaragua ``will find a better climate''
with the United States, so long as the balloting is certified as
free and fair and the resulting government maintains a democratic
system.
   Fair elections would be ``very, very helpful,'' even if the
Sandinista government wins Sunday's balloting, Bush said.
   The United States has supported political and military
opposition to the Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government, and Bush
said he thought victory by the opposition would be for the best.
   Meanwhile, NBC News reported the Bush administration already has
had ``direct'' high-level contacts with the Sandinistas, making it
clear the United States would open the door to normalizing
relations if the Sandinistas fulfilled certain conditions.
   NBC said both sides agreed to ``basic terms,'' including
certifiably free and fair elections, cessation of arms export by
the Sandinistas to leftist guerrillas in the region and increased
democracy in Nicaragua.
   According to the report, Bush would ``resume official high-level
talks, allow the current U.S. economic embargo to expire and resume
normal diplomatic relations.''
   Asked about high level talks between U.S. and Nicaraguan
officials, Bush, attending an official dinner with the nation's
governors Sunday night, said: ``Better not be ... I don't believe
it.''
   Asked about former President Carter's criticism that the U.S.
role in Nicaragua has not been constructive in recent yeras, Bush
said only ``interesting.''
   On another topic Bush said his upcoming meeting in Palm Springs,
Fla. with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, ``is very
improtant now that he's solidfied his position ... the United
States, as fascinated as we are with changes in Europe and even
South America, does not want to send a signal to our friends in the
Pacific that we are neglecting them.''
   In addition, Bernard Aronson Assistant Secretary of State for
Latin American Affairs, denied direct contacts between high-level
U.S. and Nicaraguan officials.
   He said that while U.S. embassy officials in Managua talk daily
to the Sandinista government the only contact of the level NBC
reported was made last Novemeber when the Organization of the
American States sponsored talks in Washington between the Contras
and Sandinistas, aimed at reinstating a cease-fire in the Contra
war.
   ``The notion there's been some kind of negotiations or quid pro
quo'' dealing with post-election agreements ``is just total
fantasy'' Aronson said, in a telephone interview.
   He noted that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has publicly
stated that in the event of a Sandinista victory the United States
would consider normalizing relations if the election is fair, the
Sandinistas stop exporting revolution and show commitment to
democratic principles.
   Aronson speculated that the Managua government is falsely
telling reporters it has made agreements with high-level U.S.
officials to bolster Ortega's election bid.
   ``This is just an effort to make the Sandinistas look like
winners,'' he said.
   Despite his difficulties with the Sandinista government, Bush
earlier said: ``Let me say this, if these elections are certifiably
free and fair, whoever wins the election will find a better climate
in which to improve relations with Nicaragua.''
   Asked earlier what the U.S. policy would be if Ortega, the
Sandinista leader, was kept in power in the historic Nicaraguan
voting, Bush said he would not accept the premise of the questions.
He also refused to talk extensively about Nicaragua for fear it
might influence the balloting then under way.
   But he said the government that wins the elections must prove it
supports democracratic principles. ``There has got to be a period
of establishing bona fides,'' he said.
   While elections are important, what follows ``in terms of
freedom of the press, freedom of institutions there, freedom to
protest, freedom to speak their mind'' is also crucial, he said.
   ``I would love to see Nicaragua living peacefully within its own
borders, not trying to subvert its neighbors and giving its people
a shot at democracy,'' he said.
   ``Once all that was sorted out, I can guarantee you that there
would be better relations with Nicaragua,'' he said.

   Noted Soviet ``refusenik'' David Goldfarb died
Saturday of heart failure at George Washington University Hospital,
his son said.
   Goldfarb, 71, was allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1986
after American industrialist Armand Hammer arranged for his release
in negotiations with Soviet officials.
   Goldfarb had been denied permission to emigrate to Israel in
1984 after he exposed an alleged attempt by the KGB to enlist his
aid in framing American journalist Nicholas Daniloff.
   Daniloff, then the Moscow correspondent for U.S. News &amp; World
Report, had been arrested on espionage charges.
   Goldfarb, a biology professor, was a visiting scholar at the
National Institutes of Health.
   He is survived by his wife, Cecelia, son, Alexander and
daughter. His wife and son live in New York City, his daughter in
Moscow.

   Malcolm Forbes was mourned by friends and
competitors alike as a maverick business superstar whose knack for
extravagant spending and the active life ``made all our lives a
little more colorful.''
   ``He was the quintessential American _ optimistic, buoyant and
lots of fun. He was a very good friend and I'll miss him,'' said
Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State.
   Forbes died of a heart attack in his sleep Saturday in his New
Jersey home, said William Donald Garson, director of corporate
communications for New York-based Forbes Inc.
   Mayor David Dinkins praised Forbes as one of New York City's
``most creative and vibrant characters.''
   ``In the finest tradition of American publishing, he could tweak
the greatest figures of business and finance and then entertain
them with a grand party,'' Dinkins said through a spokesman. ``He
celebrated his good fortune on a scale that only the world could
accommodate.''
   His business competitors heaped equal amounts of praise on the
tychoon who was often seen in the company of actress Elizabeth
Taylor.
   ``He was a hell of a competitor and a promotional genius,'' said
Stephen Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week magazine. ``He
gave the magazine a personality, an image of wealth, extravagance
and strong opinion. He was something of a maverick and so was his
magazine.''
   Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune magazine, called
Forbes ``one of the most effective salespeople in the world ... He
was a worthy competitor certainly, tough, charming, very, very
effective.''
   Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones &amp;
Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal said: ``He was unique
and larger than life as a journalist, entrepreneur and human being,
never afraid ... to defy convention, to chart new paths of flair
and adventure, whether in his publications or his personal life.''
   In a characteristic flaunting of wealth, Forbes last year spent
$2 million to celebrate his 70th birthday _ in Morocco. One of the
guests at the party was his longtime friend, opera star Beverly
Sills, who sang ``Happy Birthday'' to the eccentric businessman.
   ``He was a real free spirit,'' Sills said Saturday. ``He had
such a joy of life. I think he would have had it if he had been a
poor man.''
   Sills said she first met Forbes ``many, many years ago when he
wrote me a fan letter and invited me on his boat.''
   Another guest at the birthday bash, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca, said Forbes ``lived life to its fullest and in doing so
made all of our lives a little more colorful.''
   Owners of both New York baseball teams extolled Forbes' flair
and his business acumen.
   Fred Wilpon, an owner of the New York Mets and a real-estate
developer in New York, said through a spokesman that Forbes had
``scaled the heights of business journalism and left an indelible
positive mark on our society.''
   And George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York
Yankees, said through a spokesman, ``He made his mark through
integrity, a toughness and wonderful sense of humor.''
   ``Forbes was the Babe Ruth of business publishing,''
Steinbrenner said.

<HEAD>Report: Health Body Investigates AIDS Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The National Institutes of Health is
investigating allegations that the AIDS virus first discovered in
the United States six years ago is the same virus discovered nearly
a year before in France, a newspaper reported.
   The inquiry also is examining much of the related research
conducted in recent years by Dr. Robert C. Gallo, the nation's most
prominent AIDS researcher, according to the report published in
Sunday editions of the Chicago Tribune.
   Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md., reported discovery of the virus in May 1984. It was alleged
that Gallo accidentally or deliberately claimed the first sample of
the virus, isolated in France, as his own.
   The scientist is quoted in the current issue of Science magazine
as welcoming an inquiry into questions about his research.
   ``These allegations have been going on too long,'' Gallo said in
Science. ``I have done nothing wrong and I have no apprehension or
anxiety about the review.''
   At issue is Gallo's recognition as co-discoverer with a team of
scientists from the Pasteur Institute in Paris of the human
immunodeficiency virus, known as HIV, which most scientists believe
causes AIDS.
   The achievement has earned him numerous scientific honors and
prizes and more than $300,000 in personal royalties made from the
blood test with the Gallo virus.
   Another potential issue is the ultimate ownership of the patent,
now held jointly by the U.S. government and Pasteur, on the test
that has been used to check millions of individuals and units of
stored blood plasma for exposure to the AIDS virus.
   The U.S. and French governments in 1987 settled a long-running
dispute when Franch agreed to drop a lawsuit on the patent and the
two nations set up a plan for sharing proceeds.
   Domestic sales of the test are estimated at $175 million a year.
   The Tribune said the NIH started its probe Nov. 29, 10 days
after the newspaper published an article that recounted the history
of HIV and raised questions about the accuracy of Gallo's published
research.
   To assist the NIH investigation, Dr. William Raub, the
institute's acting director, has asked the National Academy of
Sciences to help assemble an advisory panel of scientists from
outside the government with expertise in virology and related
fields.
   NIH officials said Friday that they had not yet received the
names of any potential candidates, the Tribune reported.
   An academy spokeswoman said she could not recall a previous
request to assemble a panel of experts in a case of scientific
misconduct, the Tribune said.

<TEXT>
   It's the time of year when winds over the South
China Sea blow north, so Hong Kong is bracing for tens of thousands
of Vietnamese expected to set sail on the treacherous journey to
its already overcrowded shores.
   More than 35,000 Vietnamese swamped the British colony seeking
asylum in 1989. If a similar wave of boat people arrives this year,
``we're going to be in trouble,'' said Mike Hanson, who coordinates
government policy on boat people in Hong Kong.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese already are languishing in Hong Kong's
cramped, prison-like camps. Some will be resettled overseas as
refugees, but most will be deported as illegal immigrants because
they cannot prove persecution back home.
   On Sunday, local newspapers reported that a Vietnamese refugee,
30-year-old Nguyen Ho, challenged the screening policy and appeals
procedure by filing a lawsuit in the High Court of Hong Kong on
Saturday. Government radio earlier said six refugees challenged the
screening, but it did not elaborate.
   The New York-based Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights said it
helped prepare the lawsuit filed Saturday and that more such action
was forthcoming. No court dates were given.
   ``The refugee screening procedure that Hong Kong has used since
June of 1988 is cursory and filled with potential for error,'' the
group said in a statement. ``Interviewers seem intent on
establishing solely economic reasons for departure from Vietnam.
Even some people who have endured harsh `re-education' programs or
forced labor in Vietnam have been rejected.''
   It will only take a few thousand more boat people to fill Hong
Kong's existing camps to capacity. Then the government faces bleak
options.
   Local lawmakers angered by the financial burden created by the
boat people have delayed approval of a proposed $30 million
detention center on a remote outlying island.
   Lacking new facilities, Hanson said the government's contingency
plan calls for squeezing more Vietnamese into the existing camps.
   He conceded this would likely exacerbate tension in the camps,
where factional fighting is common and a handful of boat people
facing repatriation have attempted suicide. Police in riot gear
already have had to fire tear gas on several occasions to quell
clashes.
   Other steps the government might have to take include placing
new arrivals on ferries moored in the harbor, which was done at the
height of last year's influx, and erecting makeshift camps of
little more than barbed wire enclosing flat space, said a Western
diplomat who has been following developments.
   ``The real crunch comes in July, when you've run out of
everything available and still they are coming,'' said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   So far, the government has resisted calls to push arriving boat
people back out to sea, but community pressure to take such action
is sure to increase if this year's influx is heavy.
   It is impossible to estimate how many additional boat people
will show up during the spring sailing season in Hong Kong, a tiny
territory on the south China coast about 500 miles northeast of the
Vietnamese port city of Haiphong.
   Security Secretary Geoffrey Barnes said he was encouraged that
only 244 boat people had arrived this year through Feb. 22, a 45
percent decline from the same period last year. Only eight of the
1990 arrivals had sailed from northern Vietnam, the region from
which most of last year's boat people set sail.
   Barnes said the figures were too small to be regarded as
significant, but he attributed the decline in part to Vietnamese
efforts to prevent people from setting sail.
   Vietnamese officials in Haiphong city and the northern province
of Quang Ninh told The Associated Press in January of intensified
efforts to apprehend organizers of sailing journeys to Hong Kong
and to increase security along the coast.
   They also have launched a media propaganda campaign to explain
the tough living condition in the Hong Kong camps.
   ``I think that the number of people that are going to leave
Vietnam will be limited to the minimum,'' said Hoang Ngoc Tri, a
Haiphong official in charge of receiving repatriated boat people.
   ``It's very difficult to predict a figure, but we want to stop
it immediately, absolutely. All we can do is try our best,'' he
said.
   Hanson said one worrying development is that many of the
Vietnamese who have arrived in Hong Kong this year first traveled
to China by land before setting sail. The open border ``makes the
trip very easy and very cheap,'' he said.
   He believes a key to keeping the influx to a minimum lies with
continued repatriation of boat people against their will.
   The Hong Kong government adopted a tough policy in June 1988
under which boat people are considered illegal immigrants subject
to repatriation unless they can show a well-founded fear of
persecution in their homeland.
   An initial group of 51 boat people denied refugee status were
sent home against their will in December. Although Hanson believes
the move had a deterrent effect, no more Vietnamese have been
forced back since, largely because of U.S. demands they be given
until next year to consider going home voluntarily.
   The failure to get an international consensus on when to resume
deportations ``has been distinctly unhelpful,'' Hanson said.
   Hanson believes that because Washington delayed the deportation
program, it has a responsibility to help bear the cost of housing
the boat people.

   Tony Conigliaro, whose brilliant baseball career
was cut short when he was hit in the face by a pitched ball at age
22, died Saturday of kidney failure. The former Boston Red Sox
outfielder was 45.
   Vinnie Martelli, Conigliaro's uncle, said Conigliaro died at
Salem Hospital in Salem, Mass. He entered the hospital Thursday,
and had been in poor health since suffering a heart attack in 1982.
   ``He's been in a bad way since the attack several years back,''
Martelli said. ``He never quite recovered.''
   His mother, Theresa Conigliaro, said Conigliaro required
constant care after his heart attack.
   ``We lost him after eight years. He's never really been back,''
Mrs. Conigliaro said Saturday. ``The only consolation is he didn't
know what he was going through.''
   Red Sox spokesman Dick Bresciani said, ``It was a very tragic
finish for Tony. The Red Sox are deeply saddened.''
   The man the fans called ``Tony C'' was, at age 22, the youngest
major league player to hit 100 career home runs.
   He was probably most widely known, however, for the beaning that
tragically cost him his career. On Aug. 18, 1967, during a game
with the California Angels, a pitch by Jack Hamilton hit Conigliaro
on the left side of the face, leaving him with a fractured
cheekbone, a dislocated jaw and blurred vision.
   The crowd fell silent at the sound of the pitch hitting
Conigliaro's face, recalled Dick Dew, who was a sportswriter
covering the game.
   ``It stopped everybody in the place because of the sound of it.
It was unmistakable,'' said Dew. ``You knew the injury was serious
the moment you heard it.''
   Conigliaro sat out the rest of the 1967 season, and all of 1968
with vision problems.
   But in the fall of 1968 he attempted a comeback as a pitcher in
the Florida Instructional League at age 23. His vision sharpened,
and the 1969 season found him back with the Red Sox in his familiar
right field position.
   At the end of the 1970 season, Conigliaro was traded to the
Angels after having belted 36 homers and driving in 116 runs, both
career highs.
   Citing recurring vision problems, he retired after half a season
with California the following year.
   In 1975, Conigliaro again attempted a comeback with Boston, but
it ended after 21 games.
   Johnny Pesky, a former Red Sox coach who managed the team when
Conigliaro joined the club in 1964, said, ``He was so good and you
could see it. You knew he was going to be a great player.
   ``It was a shame he got hurt when he did,'' Pesky said of the
pitching accident. ``With a few more years, he could have made the
Hall of Fame.''
   After the heart attack, Pesky said he visited Conigliaro several
times.
   ``When I went over to see Tony I'd end up crying,'' Pesky said.
``He was such a big, strong kid you would have never thought that
something like that could have happened.''
   Born in Revere, Mass. on Jan. 7, 1945, Conigliaro made a splash
as a rookie in 1964, when he hit 24 homers and batted .290, despite
missing six weeks with two broken bones and other injuries.
   A year later he led the American League with 32 homers. A wrist
fracture that sidelined him for 24 games kept him from hitting
more. Still, at age 20, he was the youngest major leaguer ever to
win a home run crown.
   His lifetime major league batting average was .264, with 516
runs and 166 home runs.
   After his baseball career ended at age 30, Conigliaro worked as
a sportscaster for television stations in Providence, R.I., and San
Francisco. He also worked for a sports agent's firm in Los Angeles,
and ran a health food store north of San Francisco.
   On Jan. 7, 1982, Conigliaro auditioned for a spot on the Red Sox
telecasting team. Joseph Dimino, station manager of WSBK-TV, said
Conigliaro had been ``a leading candidate'' for the job.
   Two days later, Conigliaro suffered a heart attack, which put
him in a coma for four months. It also left him brain damaged and
affected his speech.
   He never recovered fully, but was able to walk with the aid of a
walker in his final years.
   Martelli said funeral arrangements were being planned.

   The launch of the shuttle Atlantis
on a secret military mission was scrubbed with 31 seconds left in
the countdown early Sunday, following three days of delays caused
by weather and the mission commander's health.
   ``We have scrubbed for today,'' said Lisa Malone, the launch
control center commentator.
   NASA tentatively rescheduled the launch for Monday at about 1
a.m. pending resolution of a computer problem that caused the
postponement.
   Launch director Bob Sieck briefly considered trying to launch
the craft, which carries a spy satellite, later Sunday morning. But
after assessing all their options he and his aides decided they did
not have enough time to reschedule it so soon.
   The countdown had reached the 4-minute mark when the range
safety monitor team detected a problem with one of its computers.
The clock was counted down to 31 seconds, a point where the
spacecraft computer takes control, and was held there while experts
investigated the problem.
   The range safety monitor is responsible for sending a radio
signal to destroy the shuttle if it strays too far off course and
threatens populated areas.
   There are two range safety computers, a primary and a backup,
and launch rules require both be operating, officials said. They
said the backup failed, but they did not know why.
   They said that while the count was being held temperatures on
the main engines became too cold, forcing Sieck to call off the
effort for the day.
   The five astronauts, who had been lying on their backs in the
spacecraft for nearly five hours, departed the launch pad an hour
after the scrub and returned to the crew quarters seven miles away.
   Prior to the last-minute scrub, the clock had been stopped since
Wednesday. But with the sky clear and Navy Capt. John O. Creighton
over his cold, shuttle managers gave the go-ahead to pick up the
count at midmorning for a Sunday morning launch.
   Technicians pumped half a million gallons of volatile fuel
consisting of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Atlantis'
tanks at mid-afternoon.
   A van carrying the five astronauts drove past the press viewing
area, accompanied by security vehicles and a helicopter, about 10
p.m. An hour later the launch control center reported the
astronauts were aboard the spaceship.
   Earlier, a ``red team'' of four technicians moved onto the
mobile launch platform to check out a problem with a fuel valve.
They found a leak, fixed it and the countdown continued
uninterrupted.
   Because the mission is classified, the countdown and precise
launch time are secret until the final nine minutes, but NASA said
liftoff would be between midnight and 4 a.m.
   Forecasters said hours before the planned launch that there was
an 80 percent chance the weather would be favorable at launch time.
This was up from a 70 percent prediction made earlier in the day.
   The shuttle was expected to fly northeastward, a few hundred
miles off the East Coast. If the weather was clear, the launch
could be visible for hundreds of miles, as far north as New Jersey.
   Weather officers said the temperature at launch time would be in
the mid-40s, the coldest since Challenger was launched in 36
degrees on Jan. 28, 1986, and exploded 73 seconds later after
flames escaped through a joint in one of the two solid fuel booster
rockets.
   A presidential commission said the cold weather was a
contributing factor because it prevented a rubber O-ring in the
joint from sealing properly. The joints have been redesigned and a
heater has been added to each one.
   NASA has said it would not now launch a shuttle in a temperature
below 47 degrees if the wind were less than 6 mph. The forecast was
for winds of about 16 mph, gusting to about 25 mph. A higher wind
is an advantage when temperatures dip because it keeps frost from
forming.
   Atlantis' launch path would put it in an orbit that reportedly
would cover a greater area of the globe than any other shuttle so
that the reconnaissance satellite, once released by the five-member
crew, can gather intelligence over northern areas of the Soviet
Union where there are numerous military bases and missile sites.
   Creighton's all-military crew includes Air Force Col. John H.
Casper, the pilot, and three mission specialists, Marine Lt. Col.
David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Pierre J. Thuot.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported that the
astronauts were to deploy on the second day a 37,300-pound, $500
million spy satellite capable of taking super-sharp photos and
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the
world.
   In covring most of the Soviet Union, the satellite would be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with current arms
agreements and others still being negotiated.
   NASA and the Pentagon planned to maintain a news blackout
throughout the flight, unless there was a major problem. Two
announcements were planned, one about three hours after liftoff to
report that orbital operations had begun and another 30 hours into
the flight with the date and time of landing.
   The flight was expected to last four days, with landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Military officials said the secrecy surrounding Defense
Department shuttle flights is necessary to make it more difficult
for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and spy ships off Cape
Canaveral to track the spacecraft.
   Critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly
already know a great deal about Atlantis' mission and that, once
the shuttle is in orbit, they will be able to track it precisely
and know what it is doing.
   It will be the sixth classified military mission and fourth
after-dark launch in 34 shuttle missions.

<HEAD>Analysts Foresee Rise in Oil Prices</HEAD>

   A rising demand for oil could push oil prices up
by 50 percent in the next five years, a published report said.
   The cost of oil could rise from the present average of $20 a
barrel to $30 a barrel by 1995, oil executives and analysts told
The New York Times.
   OPEC nations may not be able to pump enough oil to meet the
growing call from East Asia and newly independent eastern European
nations, the experts said.
   Expectations for increased demand come as output in the United
States and the Soviet Union is declining, according to the report
in Saturday's editions of the Times.
   ``By 1995, it is more than likely that we would have $30 oil,''
said Mehdi Varzi, chief of energy research at Kleinwort Benson
Securities in London.
   The swiftness of the increase ``will catch a lot of people by
surprise,'' he said.
   ``There are a lot of imponderables, but I would say the risk of
oil prices spiking is greater now than at any time in the last 10
years,'' said George F. Friesen, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank
Capital Corp. in New York. He also expected the price per barrel
will reach $30 in five years.
   About two dozen executives, securities analysts and economists
agreed that oil prices could rise faster than had been predicted
six months ago.
   A few disagreed, arguing that Middle Eastern producers of oil
would be able to expand production to meet the demand, and that
many nations are taking steps to reduce their demand for oil.

<TEXT>
   Sandro Pertini, a highly popular former Socialist
president of Italy and World War II hero, died Saturday night at
age 93, the Italian media reported.
   The blunt-talking Pertini, imprisoned by the Fascist government
during the war, served in the largely ceremonial presidential post
from 1978 to 1985 while Italy defeated urban terrorism and moved to
become one of the world's economic powers.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said Pertini died in his sleep
after dining with his wife, Carla, in their apartment facing the
famous Trevi Fountain in central Rome.
   The exact cause of death was not immediately known, but Pertini
had not been well since early this month after he fell in the
apartment and hit his head.
   Pertini had expressed the desire to die at home and not be
admitted to a hospital. He had asked for a private funeral at his
birthplace in northern Italy followed by cremation.
   Francesco Cossiga, who succeeded Pertini in the presidency, paid
a half-hour visit to the apartment Sunday morning.
   Pertini, elected by Parliament after Giovani Leone was forced to
resign during a scandal, was credited with boosting the morale of
Italians during the dark days of terrorism and instilling a sense
of pride.
   Born in the Italian Riviera town of Savona on Sept. 25, 1896,
Pertini studied law and political science before fighting in World
War I.
   In 1916 he helped found the Socialist Party in Italy with Pietro
Nenni, but he never allowed himself to be restricted by party lines.
   During the rise of Fascism after World War I, Pertini was
imprisoned but managed to escape to France. In 1929, during the
regime of dictator Benito Mussolini, he was captured in northern
Italy and sentenced again.
   Pertini spent nearly 10 years in Mussolini's prisons before he
escaped again to lead a resistance movement in northern Italy. The
Nazis sentenced him to death in 1943, but again he escaped and
became Socialist party secretary in 1945.
   Pertini was elected to Parliament after the war's end and
re-elected continually in the decades that followed _ serving two
terms as president of the Chamber of Deputies. For a while he
edited the party newspaper, ``L'Avanti.''
   His independent line made him acceptable to an array of parties
of the left and right, and as two-term president of the lower house
of Parliament from 1968 to 1975 he was a noted mediator whenever
tempers flared in the chamber.
   Pertini had hoped to win the presidency in 1971, but lost to the
Christian Democrat Leone. After Leone's fall and the assassination
of Aldo Moro _ whom many believed to be next in line for the
presidency _ Pertini emerged as a compromise candidate after 15
ballots in Parliament.
   He immediately brought an open style to the post, refusing to
live in the pomp of the Quirinal Palace on the advice of his
independent-minded wife.
   The couple, who had no children, kept their apartment
overlooking the Trevi Fountain, and during his frequent walks to
work or his favorite cafe, Pertini often stopped to talk to
passers-by _ a nightmare for his security detail.
   The elegantly dressed, white-haired dignitary enjoyed joking
about his age.His gallantry to women and his spontaneity with
journalists were proverbial.
   He irked some parliamentarians by his use of presidential powers
that had previously been neglected.
   In 1979 he employed his little-used authority as head of the
armed forces to end a strike by air traffic controllers, who worked
for the military at the time.
   When political bickering caused the downfall of Prime Minister
Giovanni Spadolini's coalition in August 1982, Pertini angrily
expressed the nation's exasperation when he told reporters: ``They
have ruined my vacation.'' He then called the partners together and
convinced them to accept an identical government for another try.
   Receiving Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat in Rome in 1982, he
vigorously supported the Palestinian claim for a homeland, but with
the same ardor vowed to combat anti-Semitism in Italy.
   Pertini often demonstrated his affection for the United States
in speeches and welcoming toasts, recalling U.S. aid during and
after World War II. When he visited the United States in 1982, he
kissed the American flag and exchanged an emotional greeting with
President Reagan.
   Pertini formed a friendship with Pope John Paul II, and kept a
vigil outside the pontiff's hospital room after John Paul was shot
in May 1981.

   Thousands of police and troops turned out Sunday
to control masses of pro-democracy demonstrators in the Soviet
capital, but first indications were that many heeded official
warnings and stayed away.
   Rumors of impending violence swirled around plans for nationwide
demonstrations on Sunday, and for days in advance authorities
warned of danger and appealed for responsible action.
   Thousands of people gathered on the broad Garden Ring Road in
front of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and thousands more marched
peacefully along the road that encircles the downtown area.
   ``We're fed up with how we live,'' said one Moscow demonstrator,
Celestine Langovaya, a music teacher in her 50s. ``When (Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev first came to power, I believed in him, but things
have gotten worse for millions of people.''
   Gorbachev, who came to power in 1985, has been attacked by
Communist hard-liners and reformists alike for political and
economic ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, that has yet to bring
prosperity.
   In Leningrad, riot police thwarted an unsanctioned
demonstration, dragging people aboard waiting buses before the
protest began.
   Members of the Democratic Union, a self-styled opposition
political party, were surrounded by about 100 uniformed police as
they prepared to stage their protest in a city square.
   A senior police officer speaking through a megaphone ordered the
people to disperse, saying their demonstration was not sanctioned
by authorities. About a dozen white-helmeted riot police in
bulletproof vests then dragged would-be protesters away and loaded
them onto buses.
   Among those taken into custody were two candidates in local
elections to be held March 4 in the Baltic port city. The two were
later released.
   One protester climbed atop a metal construction crane and
unfurled a yellow cloth banner that read: ``Boycott: It's your
first step to freedom.'' The demonstrator showered leaflets
repeating the message on people below before five policemen climbed
the crane and dragged him away.
   The Interior Ministry, which includes riot squads and police,
canceled days off Sunday and said it was placing one-third more
police on duty nationwide during the rallies.
   In Moscow alone, 17,000 police officers were to be on duty,
officials said Saturday.
   The government has in recent days called for calm and restraint
amid rumors that violence could break out during Sunday's planned
rallies and counter-demonstrations. Hundreds of thousands of people
in cities across the nation were expected to turn out.
   Several demonstrations were canceled because organizers feared
violence or official reprisals.
   The demonstrations grew out of the success of a protest Feb. 4,
when tens of thousands of people paraded through Moscow demanding
the Communist Party give up its grip on power.
   Three days later, the party Central Committee voted to renounce
its constitutional monopoly on power.
   Sunday is also the anniversary of the ``February Revolution,''
the 1917 populist uprising that drove Czar Nicolas II from the
throne. For many Russian progressives opposed to the Communist
Party, it marks the the short-lived triumph of Russian democracy.
The Bolsheviks seized power eight months later.
   During the Leningrad incident, Associated Press photographer
Dominique Mollard was grabbed by uniformed police as he took
pictures. He was taken to a bus, where police checked his
documents, informed him the demonstration was unsanctioned and
released him.
   Earlier in the week, authorities told pro-democracy groups that
wanted to demonstrate in Leningrad they would not be permitted to
hold their rally on the streets but would have to assemble inside a
sports complex. The groups refused and announced they would not
hold any demonstrations in the city.

   Protesters shouting anti-government
and anti-U.S. slogans tried to stone a U.S. diplomat's residence
Sunday in the southern city of Kwangju and clashed with police in
four other cities, reports and witnesses said.
   Police fired tear gas to break up the protests by students and
dissidents in Kwangju, Inchon, Taegu, Pusan and Taejon and arrested
some 100 people. About 3,000 people were involved the protests,
reports said.
   About 50 students chanting ``Yankee go home!'' were stopped
about 10 yards from the main gate of the residence of Carlton Ames,
director of the U.S. Cultural Center in Kwangju on Sunday morning,
reported the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   About 40 riot police fired tear gas to disperse the students,
and two bottles of red paint were hurled at the gate of the Kwangju
mayor's house across the street as the protesters fled, Yonhap said.
   It was not known if Ames was home at the time of the incident or
if there was any damage to his residence. Police said there were no
arrests or injuries.
   Almost simultaneously, two separate groups of about 30 radicals
attempted to attack two police substations in Kwangju but also were
dispersed by tear gas- firing police, said Yonhap.
   Radical students hurling rocks and firebombs later fought police
in two areas of Kwangju for about 30 minutes, Yonhap said. It said
the students protested the ``dictatorial'' merger last month of
President Roh Tae-woo's governing party with two centrist
opposition groups.
   Radicals and dissidents, a small but vocal minority, claim the
new giant governing party is a return to authoritarian control and
a ploy to stall democratization.
   Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul, is the stronghold of
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung whose Party for Peace and Democracy
was left isolated as a result of the merger.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment in Kwangju is strong because of belief among
its citizens that Washington condoned the harsh military crackdown
on a pro-democracy movement in the city in 1980 which resulted in
some 200 people killed and more than 1,500 others injured.
   The U.S. Cultural Center in Kwangju was temporarily closed last
May after having been attacked 28 times since 1980. U.S. officials
have indicated they would open the center this summer.

   Voters waited in lines more than 100
deep Sunday morning to cast their ballots in an election seen as a
plebiscite on President Daniel Ortega and 10 years of leftist
Sandinista rule.
   Throughout the capital of Managua, thousands of people were
waiting to vote long before polls opened at 7 a.m. ``I came at 4
a.m. because I wanted to be first,' said Ana Leona Carrero, first
of 130 people on line at a polling station in a poor western
Managua neighborhood.
   Voting was orderly and peaceful throughout the city, and voters
appeared to be in a serious mood.
   ``Lots of times we don't have enough food for three meals a
day,'' said a woman whose husband is an unemployed bricklayer. She
said there were eight people in her household and all would vote
for opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
and her United National Opposition.
   Socorro Neira Padilla said she would vote for the government;
her daughter had been wounded in the war against U.S.-supported
Contra guerrillas. ``I don't want any more war. Imagine if your
beautiful, intelligent, educated 19-year-old daughter was a
cripple,'' she said.
   Polling place officials gave detailed instructions to each
voter; voters then went behind cardboard booths to mark their
ballots. A sheet from a yellow roll of toilet paper was used to
clean the voters' fingers before they were dipped in idelible ink
to make sure people couldn't vote twice.
   No violence was reported in the countryside, although Ortega,
applauded as he voted at 7 a.m., said he was in constant contact
with military forces monitoring movements of U.S.-supported Contra
rebels in the mountains.
   ``Monday we're going to have chicken soup,'' with Mrs. Chamorro
as the chicken, said Marvin Idiarquerz, a Sandinista supporters in
Jalapa, 130 miles north of Managua on the border with Honduras.
   Troops were patrolling near Jalapa, which is only a few miles
from the Contra base camps at Yamales in Honduras, but no incidents
were reported.
   The balloting was being closely monitored by hundreds of
observers, including former President Jimmy Carter and
representatives of the Organization of American States and the
United Nations.
   Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council is expected to begin
announcing results at about 9 p.m. (10 p.m. EST) and will continue
through the night with periodic announcements.
   Significant results may not be available until Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>Former Combat Commanders Critique Panama Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. invasion of Panama succeeded not
only because the enemy was outnumbered and outgunned but because
the attack was carried out primarily by one branch of the service,
say three former combat commanders.
   The single-service philosophy was shunned in the failed Iran
rescue mission and the attack on Grenada.
   The military ``didn't make Grenada mistakes in Panama'' because
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ``made it an
Army show,'' said retired Col. David H. Hackworth said. ``You
didn't have everybody getting their share of the action for the
glory train afterward.''
   ``In Grenada, everybody was trying to get a piece of the pie,''
retired Lt. Gen. Henry E. Emerson agreed in a recent interview.
   The 1983 invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada and the
hostage rescue mission in 1980 that left the Iranian desert strewn
with wrecked U.S. aircraft were joint operations of all the
services that experts say suffered from blurred command lines and
poor coordination.
   The Grenada invasion, although successful in ousting a leftist
regime, required more than 7,000 soldiers to subdue about 700 Cuban
construction workers and soldiers.
   Grenada, which was planned in two days, ``was a military comic
opera'' characterized by bad intelligence, critical equipment
breakdowns and tactical blunders, Hackworth said in a telephone
interview from his home in Maleny, Australia.
   A report by the congressional Military Reform Caucus said an
early plan for the Grenada strike calling for the use of only Navy
and Marine forces ``was overruled by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
demanded that all four services be involved _ just as in the Iran
rescue mission.''
   The Dec. 20 assault on Panama that ousted dictator Manuel
Noriega was planned and polished for months. The 13,000 U.S. troops
based in Panama were at well-stocked bases and provided
intelligence on the Panamanian Defense Forces and protection for
the 14,000 invading troops.
   Because most of the troops were from the Army _ the only others
were two companies of Marines and 20 Navy SEAL commandos _ the
invading force had the advantage of a streamlined command structure
and uniform procedures.
   Harold G. Moore, also a retired lieutenant general who, like
Hackworth and Emerson, was an infantry commander in Korea and
Vietnam, said ``unity of command was exercised very efficiently and
effectively'' in Panama.
   The attack by light infantry units, Rangers and 3,000
paratroopers making the largest combat drop since World War II
staggered the PDF soldiers, many of whom ran away.
   ``They went in with sufficient force to overwhelm them,'' said
Hackworth. ``Psychologically, in battle this is a very important
thing.''
   Powell's influence on the planning and execution was evident,
said Hackworth and Emerson, who retired in 1977 and lives in
Helena, Mont.
   ``I see Powell as a quiet military reformer. He knows how to
make reforms diplomatically,'' said Hackworth, one of the nation's
most decorated soldiers who broke with the Army in 1971 when he
publicly criticized the use of conventional tactics to fight a
guerrilla war in Vietnam.
   Hackworth said the military's performance in Panama demonstrated
that ``the U.S. Army has greatly recovered from the trauma of
Vietnam. The Army has taken remedial action to get itself
straightened out.''
   Nevertheless, the officers cautioned the Army against glorying
too much in its Panama success.
   ``It was a very, very easy operation, a very, very soft
target,'' said Hackworth, who holds two Distinquished Service
Crosses, nine Silver Stars, eight Bronze Stars and eight Purple
Hearts.
   ``I feel the operation could have been done by 100 Special
Forces guys who could have gotten Noriega. This big operation was a
Pentagon attempt to impress Congress just when they're starting to
cut back on the military.''
   Moore noted also that 23 American soldiers died in the attack.
``There are 23 families whose lives and hearts were shattered,'' he
said.
   Moore and Hackworth said the principal flaw in the invasion was
the loss of surprise. Huge C-141 transport planes were landing at

<HEAD>First Case Worker Faces Trial in Potty-Training Death</HEAD>

   The first of three social workers goes on
trial Monday on charges of failing to report suspected child abuse
before the death of a toddler who allegedly was dunked in the
toilet for soiling his pants.
   Until the death July 28 of 2-year-old Bradley McGee, state
child-protection workers in Florida had never been criminally
charged for their handling of a case.
   Kenneth Houk, 39, is the first of the Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services workers set for trial in the case, which
focused attention on abuse and its reporting and prompted more
spending on child welfare.
   The blond, blue-eyed Lakeland boy came into state custody as a
newborn when his mother abandoned him to a woman she barely knew
who sold pretzels at a mall.
   HRS eventually gave the boy back to his mother. Two months
later, he suffered fatal head injuries from being repeatedly shoved
headfirst into a toilet and beaten with pillows for soiling his
pants, authorities say.
   His mother and stepfather, Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, and Thomas Coe,
22, are charged with murder and aggravated child abuse and face
trial this summer.
   HRS program administrator Houk, case worker Margaret Barber,
case worker Shirley DuBoise and supervisor Judy Ross were charged
with failing to report child abuse, an offense punishable by up to
60 days in jail.
   Prosecutors two weeks ago dropped the charges against Ms. Ross,
saying she was incorrectly identified as having received a report
of suspected abuse on the boy.
   Ms. Barber, who directly supervised the McGee case, was also
charged with child abuse, which carries up to five years in prison.
   ``The bottom line is that the tools, rules and procedures were
in place to save Bradley's life, and they were not used,'' said the
HRS report on which the charges were based.
   Weeks before Bradley's death, Houk and Barber received calls
that his mother had forced him to eat feces for soiling his
diapers, but they did not call HRS' abuse hot line to report the
incident as required, investigators said.
   In December 1988, according to the HRS probe, Houk received a
call contending the mother was unfit because she was drinking and
using cocaine. Houk did not call the hotline, the investigation
found.
   In both instances, Houk contended he acted in good faith by
telling the caller to notify the toddler's case worker.
   Further trials could bring out other allegations, among them
that Ms. Barber knew a psychological evaluation concluded the Coes
were incapable of ever being good parents _ yet never told the
judge who gave the toddler back to his family.
   Attorneys for the indicted HRS workers have maintained that they
performed their jobs in good faith and were under tremendous
stress. The HRS inspector noted that Ms. Barber was handling 47
cases when 20 was considered a full load.
   In November, all the defendants except Ms. Barber were offered a
plea bargain to dispose of the case for a $100 fine. They refused,
opting instead for trials to clear their name.
   ``These charges were brought for pure grandstanding purposes,''
HRS spokesman Steve Konicki said recently.
   Houk, Ms. Barber, 61, and Ms. Ross, 46, returned to HRS after
suspensions. Ms. Duboise, 43, resigned and faces trial next month.
No date is set for Ms. Barber's trial.

<HEAD>Have World War II Sinkings Had Any Lasting Effect on Environment?</HEAD>

   Tar balls washing up on East Coast
beaches may be the legacy of a long-ago war and long-lost oil
tankers _ a reminder of yesterday's pollution at a time when
today's spills have the nation on guard.
   A half-century ago, German U-boats stalking their prey close by
the U.S. Gulf and East coasts sank 148 petroleum tankers and
countless other ships, spilling or sending to the ocean bottom
millions of gallons of oil and gasoline.
   Recent big spills off Alaska and California recall those World
War II disasters and invite a basic question: What has been the
lasting impact?
   The government studied the pollution potential two decades after
the war and judged it to be minor. But conclusive answers still
remain sketchy.
   Nazi Germany unleashed its U-boats in January 1942, weeks after
the United States entered World War II. Unarmed ships traveling
along the East and Gulf coasts, sometimes silhouetted by shore
lights at night, were sitting ducks.
   In his 1978 book, ``U-Boats Offshore _ When Hitler Struck
America,'' Edwin P. Hoyt estimated that in one month in early 1942,
five German submarines cost the Allies hundreds of thousands of
gallons of gasoline.
   On Feb. 19, 1942, the tanker Pan Massachusetts was sunk off Cape
Canaveral, followed by the sinking of the Cities Service Empire,
the Republic and the W. D. Anderson along the Florida coast off
Jupiter and Palm Beach.
   The night prowlers soon grew bolder. On May 7, near Jupiter
Inlet, a U-boat torpedoed the Amazon in daylight. The same day, in
the same area, the Halsey and the Java Arrow went down. The three
tankers carried 7.6 million gallons of petroleum, said Joe Pickett,
a historian at Mayport Naval Station.
   The amount of petroleum carried by World War II tankers was
relatively small when compared with modern tankers like the Exxon
Valdez, which was carrying 53 million gallons of crude when it went
aground last March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons off
Alaska.
   Oil spills were reported up and down the coast during the war.
Oil washing ashore was a nuisance for Florida tourists and a
headache for resort operators. But there is no evidence any major
cleanup efforts were undertaken.
   The national focus was on the war effort, not on the
environment. In fact, the government censored information on such
sinkings.
   In an April 1942 story on a ship sinking off Jacksonville Beach
witnessed by crowds attending a dance, the Florida Times-Union said
newspapers ``were requested to withhold the name of the ship, its
tonnage, cargo and ports of departure and destination.''
   The U-boat threat gradually subsided as U.S. forces adopted
better evasive and anti-submarine tactics.
   Environmental officials agree the World War II spills without
doubt caused short-term damage, and in some cases sensitive shore
areas may have been permanently damaged or destroyed.
   But, as one specialist noted, oil usually degrades over two to
three years.
   ``That's not to say that we want oil spills in the environment,
because there's always a certain amount of toxicity,'' said the
specialist, Fred Stroud, a senior on-site coordinator for oil
spills for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   Oil can be devastating to mangrove stands and coral reefs, like
those in South Florida, said Stroud, who is based in Atlanta.
   A spill can also harm seabirds and colonies of oysters, clams
and shrimp in oceanside marshes, although Stroud said the shellfish
usually recover within three years. ``But if it is serious enough,
they may not bounce back,'' he said.
   Temperatures and natural ocean action aid the degradation
process, he said. In warm temperatures, such light products as
gasoline evaporate and oil degrades quickly. Heavy oil sinks to the
bottom in the form of sticky tar.
   Many tar balls that wash up on the beaches of Florida and the
rest of the Southeast could be the result of slow leakage from some
of the German-sunk tankers, Stroud said.
   In Alaska, however, the cold has slowed the degradation of the
Exxon Valdez spill, explained the EPA official.
   The federal government in 1967 studied the potential pollution
threat from the World War II sinkings.
   Coast Guard divers examined four tankers sunk in less than 200
feet of water off New York and New Jersey and found tanks mostly
emptied of oil, in some cases apparently because of seepage, in
others apparently because of the original torpedoing or metal
corrosion.
   At the site of the sunken British tanker Coimbra, 30 miles
southeast of Fire Island, N.Y., ``intermittent oil seepage was
observed on the surface of the water, but its source could not be
located,'' the report stated.
   Nevertheless, the study concluded, ``Evidence gathered from this
project indicates that tankers sunk during World War II do not
present a potential pollution threat to the American coastline.''

   A young bill collector is offering China's first
course on how to intimidate deadbeats into paying up, according to
a news report Sunday.
   The correspondence course offered by 28-year-old Sun Zheng is in
response to a national crisis in business debt and widespread
defaults on loan payments, the official China Daily said.
   Sun's two-month $17 course includes instruction in strong-arm
tactics that are legally acceptable in recovering debts, it said.
   The newspaper did not provide details but said Sun, who opened
the Great Wall Debt Collection Service in the provincial capital of
Shijiazhuang last May, commonly sends a five-man squad of
``heavies'' to pressure a borrower.
   One of the five is a legal specialist. The others do not hurt
the borrower, ``but their presence is so menancing that the man
will eventually be forced to pay back what he owes,'' the newspaper
said.
   The newspaper said Chinese businesses have accumulated $23.4
billion in debt, with many companies deeply in arrears as a result
of an 18-month government austerity program that slashed bank
credit.

   Three specialists who were sent to
a military base to investigate an explosion died when another blast
rocked the base, the official CTK news agency said Sunday.
   The brief report did not elaborate on the cause of the
explosions, and Defense Ministry officials were not immediately
available for comment Sunday.
   ``On Friday night and subsequently Saturday morning, explosions
occurred at a military base in Drhovice in two engineering corps
warehouses,'' CTK quoted Defense Ministry spokesman Stanislav
Pohoral as saying. ``During the second explosion, three experts
called in to investigate were killed, one of them a police
officer,'' CTK said.
   Two soldiers were injured and were being treated in a hospital,
said CTK.
   Drhovice is 60 miles south of Prague.

<HEAD>Poll: British Conservatives at Lowest Ebb Under Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll published Sunday indicates the popularity
of Britain's governing Conservatives is at is lowest since Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher led them to power nearly 11 years ago.
   The Conservatives trail 17 points behind Labor, enough to give
the opposition a 120-seat majority in the House of Commons,
according Market Opinion and Research International's survey for
The Sunday Times.
   The Conservatives have 100-seat majority in the House now, and
Mrs. Thatcher does not have to call an election before mid-1992.
   The poll recorded 51 percent support for Labor _ up from 12
percent in January _ 34 percent for the Conservatives and the
remaining 15 percent for minor parties. It is not the first survey
that puts the Conservatives behind.
   Survey respondents complained of new taxes and interest rates of
15 percent on bank loans. In addition, inflation in Britain is 7
percent to 8 percent.
   The pollsters said they interviewed 1,942 adults at 143 sampling
points throughout the country over five days last week. It gave no
margin of error.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in an interview with the Times, showed no alarm
over whether she would have time to improve the economy before an
election.
   ``We are not trapped,'' she was quoted as saying. ``We are still
... expecting growth.''

   An American company has signed an
agreement to search for oil and gas in Laos, according to a report
monitored Sunday in the Thai capital.
   The official KPL news agency of Laos said the Communist
government on Friday concluded the agreement with the Texas-based
Hun Oil Co., which is to conduct surveys and exploration in
southern Laos.
   Hun is believed to be the first American company to reach an
agreement with Laos to help exploit the country's considerable
energy and mineral reserves.
   Hun, which in Laos will operate as the Lao Hun Oil Co., is to
explore an area of 10,000 square miles around Pakse City and in
four southern provinces, the dispatch said.
   The agreement specifies an initial two-year operational period
that may be extended.
   Unlike Vietnam and Cambodia, the United States has maintained
diplomatic ties with Laos and relations between the two countries
have shown some improvement in recent years.

   The war on drugs won't be won until Americans
reduce their craving for them, and experts say they're mystified at
how to treat cocaine addiction, the nation's No. 1 drug problem.
   ``We know we're at sea with cocaine'' treatment, said Dr. John
P. Morgan, director of the Pharmacology Department at City
University of New York Medical School. ``The truth is, we're at sea
with most drug programs.''
   Rick Harwood of the Office of National Drug Control Policy led
by William J. Bennett gave a more optimistic assessment, saying
treatment helps even without any known cure. But he acknowledged
that cocaine addiction is a special problem.
   ``There's recidivism with every kind of drug use, but more with
cocaine than with heroin, people using amphetamines, marijuana, PCP
or a variety of other things,'' Harwood said recently.
   Harwood said researchers are trying to develop medications to
control the craving, but they are not yet ready for use. In
addition, Bennett's office is trying to get Congress to approve
rules that would require treatment facilities to provide data that
would reveal what efforts produce success.
   The nation's largest alcohol and drug treatment chain _
CareUnit, run by CompCare Corp. of St. Louis _ recently conducted a
study of recovery rates for its patients. The study deemed a
patient ``recovered'' if he or she either had abstained from all
mind-altering substances for at least a full year or had abstained
for at least six months and was abstinent when the survey was taken
and the relapse was limited, said Ken Estes, a spokesman for the
National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
   The overall recovery rate for cocaine abusers was 54 percent,
CareUnit found, but that rate dropped to 34 percent for those who
had remained abstinent for a full year, Estes said.
   By comparison, for patients using a single substance _ alcohol
in most cases _ the recovery rate was 66 percent, Estes said.
   CareUnit is an in-patient facility where the average length of
stay is about 22 days, with follow-up care involving group therapy
sessions at the clinic once a week for six months, supplemented by
attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous or Cocaine
Anonymous meetings, Estes said.
   The National Drug Control Strategy that the Bush administration
issued last September said drug addiction treatment often works,
and it cited a major study of users who received treatment for
three months or longer:
   ``About half of those treated for cocaine or heroin addiction
were not using these drugs one year later, and an additional 20 to
30 percent had reduced their drug use. ... About half of those who
remain a year or longer in a residential treatment program stay off
drugs for at least seven years.''
   However, the strategy notes that treatment for many ``works only
partially or not at all. Like other chronic diseases, drug
addiction has no permanent cure, and relapse is always a real
possibility for those who have undergone treatment.''
   For fiscal 1991, the Bush administration is seeking $1.5 billion
for treatment efforts, a 12 percent increase over the $1.3 billion
to be spent this year. That will include $183 million for drug
treatment research, says the strategy update released in January,
which notes: ``We ... need a great deal more information about
treatment methods for cocaine and crack addiction.''
   Estes, whose Irvine, Calif.-based organization represents some
700 private drug treatment providers, said clinics recently have
added separate ``cocaine tracks'' to their programs.
   ``What stimulated that was you could tell cocaine patients
weren't doing that well'' when they were lumped together with
general alcohol abusers, even though cocaine addicts often also use
other drugs such as alcohol and marijuana, Estes said.
   ``They're a different breed of cat _ real jumpy, real hyper,''
he said.
   James N. Hall, executive director of the Up Front Drug
Information Center in Miami, said some cocaine abuse treatment does
work _ especially longterm treatment that allows brain chemicals
the many months needed to return to normal levels _ and he
contended that relapses aren't failures.
   ``It's considered by some therapists almost a natural course in
recovery,'' he said. ``If an individual relapses, it doesn't mean
the individual has failed. You have to consider the time before
relapse and how short the relapse is. We tend to take a criminal
justice model in looking at this medical problem,'' viewing a
relapse in the same terms as a recidivist criminal who must be sent
back to jail.
   In addition, he said, people from lower socio-economic
communities hard hit by crack epidemics have little chance to fight
their addiction when they return home with no prospects for
alternatives to drugs.
   ``For many crack addicts, the issue is habilitation, not
rehabilitation,'' he said.

   Unless birth control becomes available to
everybody by the end of the decade, the number of people on this
already overcrowded planet will double before a baby born today
reaches middle age, according to a study released Sunday.
   ``This is a preventable disaster,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice
president of the private Population Crisis Committee, a
Washington-based advocacy group that released the report.
   ``We have what it would take _ the financial resources and the
know how _ to solve the problem, and to do so in our children's
lifetime.
   ``But we have to act immediately. We cannot dither away another
decade,'' she said.
   There are about 5.3 billion people in the world, a figure that
the United Nations says could rise to 14 billion before stabilizing
in the next century. The committee said today's population could
double in 39 years and reach 27 billion by the end of the 21st
century if present birth and death rates continued unchanged.
   Stopping population growth at about 9 billion to 10 billion
people would require use of contraceptives by some 75 percent of
couples, the study estimates. But to accomplish that the products
would have to be available to everyone by the end of this century
so the average family size could fall to about two children per
couple early in the 21st century.
   The report goes on to estimate the cost of such an effort _
$10.5 billion per year by the year 2000. Currently $3.2 billion is
spent on family planning in developing countries, where most
population growth is taking place.
   To finance this effort the report calls for increased aid from
industrial nations, including $1.2 billion from the United States,
$4 billion from other developed nations, $1 billion from
development banks, $500 million from private philanthropists and $1
billion from consumers of family planning services.
   ``Universal family planning is a bargain compared to the costs
of delaying world population stabilization,'' Camp said.
   The analysis found 29 countries, including the United States,
Japan and most of Europe, well on the way to ending population
growth.
   In addition, a dozen countries were making ``good'' progress,
the report said. These included Argentina, Poland, Israel, Turkey
and Thailand.
   But 18 nations were rated poor and 45 as very poor in
encouraging birth control.
   Here is a country-by-country rundown of the committee's rankings
of population control efforts.
   Excellent:
   Czechoslovakia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland, France, West
Germany, Italy, Sweden, Taiwan, Bulgaria, South Korea, United

<HEAD>Juries Tougher Than Judges On Convicted Felons, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The term ``hanging judge'' may have to be
rethought. More people convicted of felonies by state court juries
wind up in prison than those found guilty by judges, and they spend
a longer time incarcerated, says a study released Sunday.
   At the same time, the overwhelming majority of convicted felons
_ 89 percent _ plead guilty, and those who own up to their misdeeds
spend a shorter time in prison than those convicted by a judge or a
jury, the Justice Department reported.
   The penalties of life in prison or death are meted out to 47
percent of those convicted by juries of murder or non-negligent
manslaughter. Meanwhile, only 15 percent of those who pleaded
guilty to such charges and 12 percent of those found guilty by a
judge received those penalties, said the report by the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   It is unclear why defendants convicted by juries were more
severely punished, the study said. But it noted that ``a higher
percentage of the convictions by juries were for violent offenses.''
   Within each type of offense _ ranging from murder to drug
trafficking to larceny _ ``a higher percentage of particularly
serious cases may have been decided by juries,'' the study said.
   ``Defendants in such serious cases, violent and nonviolent, may
have been less willing to plead guilty because they expected very
severe penalties,'' it added. ``In addition, prosecutors may have
recommended and judges may have imposed shorter sentences for those
who pled compared to those found guilty by trial.''
   The study _ based on information from 100 counties in 37 states
regarding all convicted felons sentenced in 1986 _ cautioned that
the findings should be considered preliminary because of the
limited sample size. The next survey is to cover 300 jurisdictions.
   Of the estimated 583,000 people convicted of a felony in state
courts in 1986, 89 percent pleaded guilty, 8 percent were convicted
by a jury and 3 percent were found guilty by a judge, the report
says.
   But many of the guilty pleas were for lesser offenses, with 92
percent of the larceny convictions and 90 percent of the burglary
convictions based on guilty pleas, but only 58 percent of the
murder convictions and 68 percent of the rape convictions based on
such pleas.
   Felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to an average of 159
months in prison, compared with 103 months when felons were
convicted by a judge and 72 months for those who pleaded guilty.
   Also, 84 percent of felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to
prison or jail rather than probation or other types of sentences,
while 71 percent of those convicted by a judge were incarcerated
and only 65 percent of those who pleaded guilty were incarcerated.
Prison sentences, not including jail terms, were handed down to 71
percent of those convicted by a jury, 50 percent of those found
guilty by a judge and 44 percent of those who pleaded guilty.

   Rival student political groups fired
pistols and sawed-off shotguns and hurled homemade bombs at each
other Sunday, killing at least two people and wounding 12 others,
police and witnesses said.
   Vice Chancellor Abdul Mannan said Dhaka University would be
closed indefinitely, and students in the 13 dormitories were
ordered to leave the campus by Sunday night.
   The fighting broke out when supporters of two opposition
parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
tried to conduct rallies at the same place at the same time. The
parties called the rallies to protest attacks on each other's
supporters last Wednesday.
   Demonstrators fired at least 100 rounds of ammunition and threw
several small bombs during the 40-minute clash, according to police
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police fired rifles in the air
and tear gas to break up the fighting. They said police gunfire did
not cause any casualties.
   Shahidul Islam, a central leader of the Bangladesh Students
League which is affiliated with the Awami League, was shot in the
forehead and died instantly, police said. The identity of another
slain student was not immediately known.
   Hours after the clash, Awami League supporters vented their
anger by hurling stones and damaged about 12 vehicles parked in
front of their office in central Dhaka, said police officials
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Campus rallies frequently turn violent in Bangladesh.
Wednesday's trouble started during commemorations marking the
anniversary of the deaths in 1952 of at least five students known
as ``the language martyrs.'' The 1952 killings by police occurred
during a demonstration to make Bangla an official language in East
Pakistan.
   East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh in
1971 after a nine-month war between the Bangla-speaking East
Pakistanis and the West Pakistanis who dominated the national
government and used Urdu as the state language.
   The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party both
oppose the present Bangladeshi government of President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad, but supporters of the two parties often clash.
University officials said at least 10 Dhaka University students
have died in clashes between the two opposition parties in the past
four years.

<HEAD>Police Prevent Pro-Democracy Protest Marches in Nepal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>

   Riot police armed with rifles arrested at
least 150 people Sunday to prevent marches by pro-democracy
demonstrators demanding the government lift its 29-year-old ban on
political parties.
   The protesters, shouting ``Long live the revolution!'' were
taken into custody as they entered Katmandu's main shopping
district of New Road to begin marching, said witnesses who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The planned march was one of several scheduled around Nepal by
two banned political groups, the Nepali Congress Party and a
left-wing coalition, who are leading a movement for more political
freedom.
   Political demonstrations are not allowed in Nepal.
   According to the government, at least 12 people have been killed
since Feb. 18 when the movement was launched to demand restoration
of a multiparty democracy.
   Activists say the death toll is nearly double the government
figure.
   Activists said at least 1,000 people were taken into custody
Sunday, mostly in the capital, but the witnesses, who have proved
reliable in the past, said they only saw about 150 people being
herded into a police station.
   The police refused to give any figures.
   Residents contacted by telephone said police also arrested
demonstrators in the southeastern town of Dharan on Sunday, but
they had no details.
   The outcome of the other planned marches was not immediately
known.
   The state-run news agency said without elaborating that ``some
persons who tried to raise undesirable slogans'' were arrested in
the southern town of Nepalganj. The report was the only reference
by the government to any demonstration in the Himalayan kingdom,
one of the world's oldest monarchies.
   Witnesses said those arrested in Katmandu included Hari Bol
Bhattarai, former mayor of the city and a senior member of the
Nepali Congress, and Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a left-wing member of
the National Assembly.
   Both were waving the black flags adopted by the new
pro-democracy movement and were shouting anti-government slogans
when policemen tore the flags from their hands and took them away,
said witnesses.
   Earlier Sunday, more than 100 doctors and nurses in the
country's largest hospital walked off their jobs for more than one
hour in support of the pro-democracy movement. They gathered
outside the 300-bed Bir Hospital in the capital, wearing black
armbands over their white jackets.
   ``We mourn the death of our people,'' said one doctor, who
refused to give his name for fear of reprisals. ``This is a protest
against the government's violation of human rights.''
   Medical students said in a statement they supported the movement.
   In Katmandu, hundreds of steel-helmeted policemen, wearing chest
pads and carrying rifles, batons, bamboo shields and tear-gas
canisters, patrolled the 2-square-mile New Road area, watched by
reporters and throngs of tourists.
   Shops were closed, and only police vans and a few private
vehicles were allowed in the usually bustling area.
   The government has accused the demonstrators of trying to impose
their brand of democracy on a country which it says already has a
working democracy.
   Power in Nepal is shared between the king and the National
Assembly. One-fifth of the assembly's 140 members are nominated by
the king. The rest are elected on a non-party basis. Advocates of
multiparty democracy say the elections are a farce and that the
only candidates allowed are those approved by King Birendra or his
associates.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when then-King Mahendra, the present monarch's father,
dissolved the government of the Nepali Congress Party, accusing it
of corruption and poor administration.

<HEAD>Justice Considering Hiring Private Company for Nazi-Hunting Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is weighing whether to
farm out to private business the work of government historians who
furnish research ammunition for the agency's special Nazi-hunting
unit.
   The proposal is being studied as part of the Bush
administration's effort to save money by ``privatizing'' certain
functions performed by government workers. But it has caused alarm
in some circles that the work of the unit _ the Office of Special
Investigations _ will be undermined.
   An official of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the leading research
center on the mass extermination of Jews before and during World
War II, criticized the idea, saying it comes at a time when changes
in Eastern Europe will give unprecedented access to Nazi records.
   ``It is absolutely beyond belief that a diminution of the work
of OSI would be considered at this point,'' said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate dean of Los Angeles-based center.
   He said changes in East Germany make it likely that the Justice
Department will be able for the first time to study the files of
the Gestapo in East Berlin _ and that this opportunity must be
seized.
   ``Contracting work to the outside, I'm afraid, might be the
signal that the government is looking to begin the process of
paring back the work of the OSI,'' Cooper said.
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett denied that, saying
``we obviously want to make sure there is no diminution in the
level of services provided by the OSI employees.''
   Tillett said the department is only studying the feasibility of
hiring a private contractor to do the work. The study was
undertaken to comply with a White House Office of Management and
Budget directive that all agencies identify jobs that could be
contracted out to private companies, he said.
   Government historians are listed by OMB as positions that could
be turned over to private contractors, he said.
   Tillett said contractors must show they can do the work for a
price that is 10 percent lower than what it now costs the
government.
   The plan envisions using a private company to do the work of six
government historians. These government employees over the years
have read German, Russian and other East European languages,
authenticated and interpreted World War II-era documents that
prosecutors used to prove involvement in Nazi persecution of Jews
and other war crimes.
   They are described by former Justice Department officials as key
participants in the investigations conducted by the OSI. Since it
was founded in 1979, that unit has investigated more than 1300
cases of suspected Nazis living in this country.
   During the last 11 years, 27 former Nazis have been deported or
extradited to other countries after the Justice Department
unearthed proof they were involved in Nazi war crimes.
   The typical Nazi war criminal identified by Justice Department
investigators was a former guard at a concentration camp or the
member of an SS militia that persecuted Jews or other ethnic groups
in Nazi-occupied countries. They came to this country by concealing
their Nazi past to U.S. immigration authorities.
   Martin Mendelsohn, a Washington attorney who helped set up the
unit when he worked at the Justice Department, also criticized the
plan.
   ``Given the fact that office has been understaffed for years,
they shouldn't be further reducing the number of people that they
have,'' said Mendelsohn.
   The department would be losing many experienced people, he said.
``Most of them have been there for some time.''
   Jeffrey N. Mausner, a former Justice Department lawyer who
worked in the unit, said the six employees ``serve both as
historians and investigators.''
   ``They locate documents, determine the historical significance
of the documents,'' Mausner said. They also help locate witnesses
to bolster the Justice Department's evidence, he said.
   Besides German and Russian, the historians are expert in Baltic
and Balkan languages, he said.

   Ben Vereen cited his own past involvement with
drugs in telling about 600 students at an inner-city school not to
waste time and talent by using drugs.
   ``You have genius inside of you. Don't believe everything on
television telling you that you can't do anything. You can,'' said
Vereen, founder of Celebrities for a Drug-Free America.
   The 43-year-old actor-dancer, appearing through Sunday with the
Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, said he spent almost 20 years under
the influence of drugs.
   ``I regret that. Most of all I regret the wasted time,'' he said
Friday at Fulton Middle School. ``I never had enough time with my
daughter.''
   He said he gave up drugs shortly after the death of his
daughter, Naja, at the age of 16 in a 1987 traffic accident.

   Former Black Panther Stokely Carmichael,
now using the name Kwame Ture, is updating his 1960s call to
political action, recruiting students for his All African People's
Revolutionary Party.
   ``If you don't join our party, then join some other party. ...
If you can't find an organization you like, then make your own
party,'' he said in a speech at Laney College.
   ``You must help your people,'' Ture, 48, said Friday. ``If you
don't, by your very inactivity, you are against your people.''
   As Stokely Carmichael, he headed the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee during the civil rights struggles of the
'60s. He later joined the Black Panther Party.
   In 1979 he named himself after African revolutionary leaders
Kwame Nkrumah and Sekou Ture. He now lives in the West African
nation of Guinea and promotes African unification under a socialist
system.

   Robert Mays, who waged a bitter battle over
the apparent hospital swap of his daughter and another baby has
married for the third time in a ceremony that included the girl
he's raised as his own for 11 years.
   Mays, 44, and Darlena Souza, 32, were wed Saturday in Orlando.
Kimberly Mays, who learned in November that Mays is not her
biological father, was a large part of the ceremony.
   ``We're going to accept one another in our vows and then we'll
accept (Kim),'' Mays said earlier. ``She's going to play a big part
of it.''
   Genetic tests showed that Kimberly is the daughter of Ernest and
Regina Twigg, formerly of Langhorne, Pa., and that the girl the
Twiggs raised and named Arlena was really the daughter of Mays and
his first wife, Barbara. Arlena died of heart disease in 1988.
   In an agreement last year with the Twiggs, Mays was allowed to
keep Kimberly.
   Barbara Hays died of cancer in 1981, shortly after the girl's
second birthday. Another marriage lasted more than six years,
ending in divorce.

<HEAD>Candidates in 1990 Senate Races Already Have Raised $62 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates in 1990 Senate races raised $62
million last year, topped by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas
who received nearly $6 million in contributions, federal statistics
show.
   Gramm was among four incumbents raising more than $3 million,
according to the analysis released Sunday by the Federal Election
Commission. The others were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., with $4.7
million; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., with $3.6 million; and Paul
Simon, D-Ill., with $3.3 million.
   Twenty-two people reported contributions of more than $1
million, all of them incumbents except three Republican House
members and Texas Democrat Hugh Parmer, a state senator taking on
Gramm.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., reported raising $1.5 million for her
challenge to Simon. The FEC said GOP Reps. Hank Brown of Colorado,
running for an open seat, and Tom Tauke of Iowa, contesting
incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin, also raised more than $1 million
apiece last year.
   Gramm reported $6.1 million cash on hand going into 1990, the
most of any candidate. Bradley, who faces no serious opposition,
was second with $4.1 million. He also spent the most last year _
$2.8 million.
   The FEC report covered 31 incumbents and 29 challengers, plus 10
candidates in three open-seat races in Colorado, Idaho and New
Hampshire. The agency said the candidates reported raising $62
million and spending $28 million during 1989.
   By comparison, candidates in 33 Senate races in 1984 had spent a
little more than $35 million in 1983.
   The candidate receiving the most money from political action
committees last year was Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. The FEC said
he took in $830,200. Simon was second with $732,848, followed by
Gramm with $715,313. A dozen candidates in all reported raising at
least a half-million dollars each from PACs.
   In the same states six years ago, the FEC said, the top five PAC
recipients received less than $400,000 each from the committees.
   The agency said only 12 candidates raised over $1 million in
1983 compared with 22 last year. Three spent more than $1 million,
compared with nine in 1989; and six had more than $1 million in
cash going into the 1984 election year, half the number with that
amount on hand for 1990.

   When Joseph Hazelwood became the target
of criminal charges in the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the tanker
captain turned to a former maritime college classmate who had
become a lawyer.
   The lawyer brought in a friend from his law school days, and
they then turned to a former law partner of Alaska's governor for
help.
   They'll all be on center stage this week to open their defense
of Hazelwood, portrayed in three weeks of prosecution testimony and
questioning as a drunk who let his ship get away from him.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with a felony and
three misdemeanors in the March 24 grounding that caused the
nation's worst oil spill. He could receive up to 7\ years in prison
and $61,000 in fines.
   His ship struck a reef outside normal shipping lanes and gushed
nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil into scenic Prince
William Sound, coating hundreds of miles of shore with black goo.
Hazelwood is the only person criminally charged in the disaster.
   At the counsel table with Hazelwood in Superior Court is Michael
Chalos, 42, an exuberant advocate whose knowledge of nautical
terminology and navigational logic has proved invaluable.
   Chalos was born in Chios, Greece. When he was 8, his family
moved to Long Beach, N.Y. He attended the state university's
Maritime College at Fort Schuyler, where he met Hazelwood.
   ``He was in the class of '68 and I was in the class of '70,''
said Chalos. ``We both played lacrosse.'' They became friends and
stayed in touch.
   Chalos worked as a seaman for three years before entering
Fordham University Law School, from which he graduated in 1975. His
New York firm, Chalos, English &amp; Brown, now has 20 lawyers. He has
used Hazelwood as an expert witness in maritime cases.
   A member of the firm and of the Hazelwood defense team is Thomas
Russo, 43, a former chief assistant district attorney in New York.
Russo and Chalos met at Fordham and kept in touch.
   ``Mike and I had talked for many years about working together,''
Russo recalled. ``He thought I might like the change of working in
a nice, quiet maritime practice.'' They joined forces two years
ago. ``Then, he calls and tells me we're representing Captain
Hazelwood.''
   They needed an Alaska lawyer to augment the team and, after much
research, chose Dick Madson of Fairbanks.
   Madson, 54, a native of Keewatin, Minn., and a 21-year resident
of Fairbanks, brings to the defense knowledge of Alaska law and an
insider's view of the state's political backbone. His longtime
partner was Steve Cowper, Alaska's governor.
   Madson moved to Alaska with his wife and three children after
graduating from William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, Minn.
He has an undergraduate degree in mining engineering.
   He was one of Alaska's first public defenders and since has
handled a wide array of criminal cases.
   ``We recognize this is a case in Alaska and you can't get more
Alaskan than Dick,'' said Russo. ``He has the Alaska perspective.''
   Madson's folksy witticisms often amuse the jury while bringing
stern reprimands from Judge Karl Johnstone.
   Russo said he sees the Hazelwood trial as a diversionary tactic
by state and federal agencies to play down their own potential
culpability. He calls Hazelwood a scapegoat.
   ``It's about money,'' Chalos said. ``There's a lot of money
involved. You've got plaintiffs with lawsuits involving billions of
dollars.''
   Madson said: ``The heart of it is a political trial.''
   Chalos would not discuss the financial arrangement the lawyers
have with Hazelwood.
   Hazelwood has been reviled by Alaskans because of the spill, but
his lawyers see a shift in attitude.
   ``I was walking down the street with him this week,'' Madson
said, ``and a woman stopped her car and yelled out `Is that Captain
Hazelwood?' I said, `No, that's not him.' Then she shouted, `I love
him!' I shouted back: `That's him!'''

   Here is a transcript of a joint press
conference held by President Bush and West German Chancelor Helmut
Kohl.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Barbara and I met February 24th and 25th here at
Camp David with Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic
of Germany, and his wife Annalore (sp) and we were just delighted
to have them here. The Chancellor and I had an opportunity to talk
at length about recent political developments in Europe and about
East-West relations. And I am pleased to say that we share similar
views on the most fundamental issues. We both welcome the prospect
of further movement toward German unification, beginning with the
steps toward economic and monetary union that are proposed for the
period immediately following the elections in the GDR on March 18th.
   ``If events are moving faster than we expected, it just means
that our common goal for all these years of German unity will be
realized even sooner than had been hoped. We share a common belief
that a unified Germany should remain a full member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, including participation in its
military structure. Now we agreed that US military forces should
remain stationed in a united Germany and elsewhere in Europe, as a
continuing guarantor of stability.
   ``The Chancellor and I are also in agreement that in a united --
in a unified state, the former territory of the GDR should have a
special miliary status that would take into account the legitimate
security interests of all interested countries, including those of
the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Chancellor and I agree that
we must continue to press hard for arms control efforts which would
sharply reduce military forces in Europe from the Atlantic to the
Urals. We want to work together to have a CFE agreement ready for
signature this year at a summit meeting of all 35 CSCE member
states. The summit could also endorse our proposal for CSCE
guidelines on free elections to help show the way and protect the
emerging democratic institutions of Eastern Europe.
   ``Chancellor Kohl and I had a good discussion on East-West
relations. We both support Chairman Gorbachev's program of
perestroika, his efforts to reform his country's political and
enomic system. Chairman Gorbachev has shown true statemanship in
respecting the will of the people in Eastern Europe in trying to
build new relationships based on cooperation instead of coercion.
Since those difficult days following World War II, when America
joined hands with the German people in their effort to build a new
state and a new society, the United States has been their partner
in a common dream, and that dream was to build a free, democratic,
and prosperous German republic committed to peace and working in
close harmony with its closest neighbors. That enduring
German-American partnership has never been stronger as Chancellor
Kohl, the leader of one of the world's great democracies, steps
toward a golden moment in the history of his nation. Mr.
Chancellor, it was a pleasure to have you with us and now for your
statement, sir.

   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
once praised as a peacemaker and the driving force of an
agricultural power, increasingly has been targeted in complaints
about police repression and a souring economy.
   Police in the past week have beaten and arrested hundreds of
demonstrators who demanded the ouster of Africa's longest-serving
president and an end to his one-party, conservative rule.
   The official media, which have built a personality cult around
Houphouet-Boigny, have made no mention of the protests.
   Houphouet-Boigny chaired a Cabinet meeting during last week's
unrest, but state media reported only that officials discussed the
West African nation's economic crisis.
   Austerity measures that helped provoke the unrest were required
by Western donors, who already have rescheduled the country's $12
billion debt.
   ``Our cup of anger overflowed when the last drop of water
dribbled from the tap,'' a law student said, describing the scene
one night last week in the communal bathroom of a student residence
darkened by power cuts.
   The state-run power company said the cuts Feb. 19 were caused by
an explosion at a transformer. No mention was made of the water
shortage.
   Students and Radio Treichville, the name given to the
well-informed rumor network, said workers forced to take 30 percent
pay cuts caused the service disruptions as a protest.
   The methods used against protesters are not in the usual style
of the 84-year-old president, who has led this nation of 11 million
people since its independence from France in 1960.
   ``He has perfected the art of co-opting the opposition,'' said
Laurent Gbabgo, an opposition leader.
   ``In the past, people did not feel badly governed because, if
there was a problem, the government just bought it out. They had
lots of money and just doled it out,'' he said.
   Houphouet-Boigny's government has not been above tough tactics.
   When it felt threatened by criticism from the university
lecturers' union in 1987, it simply hijacked the body. Office
holders were arrested for alleged embezzlement of funds and drafted
into two years' military service. A hand-picked committee replaced
them.
   But the economic problems have unearthed such dissent that
Houphouet-Boigny called a national dialogue in September, and told
delegates no holds were barred.
   It brought at least one demand he could not stomach, again from
the university lecturers' union. Union president Marcel Ette urged
creation of a multiparty democracy.
   The president responded that there would be no multiparty
democracy in Ivory Coast, at least not in his lifetime. As other
African dictators have done, he argued that a multiparty system
would endanger national unity in a country still beset by tribal
rivalries.
   ``The Ivory Coast Constitution allows political opposition. But
things start happening if you try to insist on your rights,''
Gbagbo said in an interview. ``You and your friends get arrested.
Your bank account gets frozen. Suddenly, business isn't good.''
   Houphouet-Boigny vigorously encouraged agricultural production
of the cash crops pushed by Western institutions in the 1960s and
1970s.
   While most of black Africa became net food importers following
independence from European colonial powers, his efforts spurred
Ivorian farmers to record production.
   Last year, amid a continuing slump in commodity prices, Ivory
Coast produced a record 820,000 tons of cocoa, nine times what it
produced in 1960 and nearly a third of world production. It is the
world's biggest cocoa producer.
   But cocoa prices were slashed to half those of 1985. In October,
Houphouet-Boigny was forced to abandon his promise to support
prices for farmers, and he cut promised producer prices for cocoa
and coffee in half.
   Critics like Gbagbo say the president is too old and set in his
ways to look to industrialization and other routes to revive the
economy.
   But Houphouet-Boigny looks more like a man in his 70s and
appears alert, astute and far from ready to retire.
   ``The old regime is dying, but it's dying badly,'' Gbagbo
complained.
   Its dying throes will come because Ivorians are being hit where
it hurts most: in their pockets, he said.
   When wealthy Ivorians go to the bank to cash a $17,500 check,
the liquidity crisis forces the banks to tell them to make the
check out for $88, he said.
   A government clerk feeling the pinch of a pay cut expressed it
another way: ``Last year I gave my son a few francs for lunch and
he could have a hot stew and grilled bananas. The same money today
buys only the bananas. And I don't have the extra money to buy him
the stew.''

   X X X statement, sir.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL (through interpreter): (Translator starts in
progress) -- the reception here in Camp David. The atmosphere, the
climate of our meeting is symbolic of the excellent German-American
relations. In particular now, when the day of unity is drawing near
for us Germans, we are conscious with profound gratitude of the
fact that all of this would not have been possible without the
close friendship and the confident partnership with the United
States of America.
   ``In the spirit of this friendship, the two of us, Mr.
President, in the course of these hours in Camp David, we have
discussed a vast list of political issues. In the center of our
conversations was the future of the transatlantic relations and,
embedded therein, the path of the Germans towards national unity.
Against the background of historic changes on the European
continent, we have reconfirmed our common beliefs. First, the
alliance of the free democracies in Europe and North America, and
included therein the German-American partnership, are of
fundamental importance for peace and security. This is true now;
this will be true in future. Second, the security link between
North America and Europe is and continues to be, and in the future,
for us Germans -- that is to say, also for a united Germany -- of
vital importance. That is why we need the presence of our American
friends in Europe, in Germany, and that includes the presence of
American forces. Also, for a united Germany in the future,
maintaining the friendship with the United States of America and
the expansion of relations with them will be an important task.
   ``We are happy about the ever closer economic cooperation and
economic exchange, exchange in the fields of science and culture,
and about the ever more meaningful meetings between people, in
particular of the young generation. We are convinced that
transatlantic relations must systematically be expanded in all
fields. It is the common security in the alliance which is part of
this, of the ever closer contacts between the European Community,
including political cooperation, and the United States. And this
includes also our joint efforts to make our way towards a European
peace order within the framework of the CSCE. Seeing the major
changes in Central Europe, East Europe, Southeast Europe, the
European Community continues to be an indispensable anchor of
European civility.
   ``That is why we, the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular
myself, do not only want to expand European integration but we want
to accelerate this process wherever possible. Beyond the big
internal market which is to be achieved on the 31st of December,
1992, beyond the economic and monetary union, our primordial aim
continues to be political union in Europe. That was the objective
of the treaties of Rome and nothing has changed in that area. It is
our joint interest that the reform policy in Central, East and
Southeast Europe and, in particular, the policy led by Secretary
General Gorbachev and the Soviet Union will be successful. Europe
and North America are and continue to be open for cooperation as
partners, in particular with the reform states. And I welcome
particularly what you have just said about the subject, Mr.
President.
   ``And because of our conversations, we're also agreed that
disarmament negotiations must energetically be pursued and be led
to a success. On the path towards German unity, ladies and
gentlemen, what we need in particular now is reason and good
judgment. We Germans walk along this path with a particular
responsibility in the center of Europe. And we're doing so, if you
like, along two tracks which are of equal importance. On the one
hand, we are leading intensive talks with GDR, and at present we
will, in particular, have to concentrate on the customs union and
the Economic Community. On the other hand, we do have to consider
that the link with our transatlantic partners, that European unity
and comprehensive cooperation between East and West are being
linked up with the development. We do respect the legitimate
security interests of all states and we respect people's feelings,
especially the feelings of our neighbors.
   ``And I am saying this particularly addressing our Polish
neighbors. The border question will be settled definitely by a
freely elected, all-German government, and a freely elected
all-German parliament. But let me repeat here what I have recently
said in Paris already -- it was in January of this year -- nobody
has any intention of linking the question of national unity with
changes of existing borders.

<HEAD>Sullivan Finds His Voice With Anti-Smoking Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louis Sullivan, after a shaky start as the
nation's top health official, has seized the anti-smoking campaign
as his own, winning kudos from Congress and grabbing headlines with
talk of ``blood money'' and ``trading death for corporate profits.''
   Following the well-worn path of previous federal health
officials, Sullivan, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
has cranked up the war of words against tobacco companies to new
heights.
   ``He certainly has found an area where he has been willing to be
outspoken and has taken the leadership,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee.
   But some say smoking is a safe issue, since Sullivan isn't
attacking tobacco subsidies or proposing a ban on advertising. And
they say Sullivan, who for nearly a year has run the federal
department with the largest budget, has yet to show such bold
leadership on the larger issues confronting the administration,
including the nation's soaring health-care bill.
   Sullivan first stepped out on the smoking issue Jan. 18 when he
criticized R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s plan to target blacks with a
new cigarette brand called Uptown. The next day the company
canceled plans for the new product, but Sullivan promised to
continue his attack on the tobacco industry.
   Last week, Sullivan called on athletes and athletic associations
to reject tobacco company sponsorships _ and he didn't mince words:
``This blood money should not be used to foster a misleading
impression that smoking is compatible with good health.''
   Appearing before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
a few days earlier, he said ``it is morally wrong to promote a
product which, when used as intended, causes death, trading death
for corporate profits.''
   In the wake of reports that Reynolds had considered marketing a
new cigarette brand called Dakota to young women with no more than
a high school education, Sullivan said such advertising was
``dishonest, irresponsible and unconscionable.''
   Before he seized the anti-smoking issue, Sullivan had been on
the defensive for most of his first year on the job. First he
angered right-to-life groups with comments implying that he
supported abortion rights. He quickly retreated and said he
supported President Bush's anti-abortion stand.
   Later he raised another storm when he endorsed local community
efforts to experiment with needle-exchange programs to help stem
the spread of AIDS. He later backed off that statement as well.
   His bold anti-smoking campaign, however, is helping to turn
around his image as a fumbling newcomer to Washington politics.
   ``It increases his profile in the administration and in
Congress, and that can do nothing but help,'' said Edmund
Haislmaier, health care policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation,
a conservative think tank.
   ``The real test, though, is how effective he's going to be ...
in advocating reform in the programs in his department,''
Haislmaier said. The effects of an anti-smoking effort are ``very
small. It will have a positive impact, but how much and when is a
very debatable question and does not really deal with the major
health care financing issues HHS is involved in.''
   On the tobacco issue, Sullivan is following a trail blazed by
previous public health officials dating back to the first surgeon
general, Luther Terry, who put out the initial surgeon general's
report on smoking in 1964.
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, before he left office
last summer, was the nation's leading anti-smoking crusader for
most of the 1980s. With no statutory authority or budget, Koop used
his post as bully pulpit to preach the dangers of smoking,
endorsing a ban on cigarette advertising and declaring nicotine to
be as addictive as heroin.
   Before him, Joseph Califano, secretary of what then was called
the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, campaigned
aggressively against smoking and drew a lot of fire in the process.
He angered many members of Congress from Southern tobacco-growing
states.
   Sullivan said he has gotten ``not one iota of pressure'' from
the administration to back off from his campaign.
   ``I've gotten support and commendations from not only members of
Congress but also members of the administration,'' he said.
   But Sullivan has refrained from being anything more than an
anti-smoking advocate. Asked whether the government should cut off
subsidies to tobacco growers, or whether cigarette taxes should be
raised, he says those are not decisions for him to make.
   ``My role is to put the facts out ... to advocate,'' he said.
   Waxman said that while he applauds Sullivan's anti-smoking
leadership, ``I hope now to see him follow up his statements with
support for legislation.''
   The California Democrat plans to introduce a bill focusing on
regulation of tobacco promotions and advertising, along with
stronger warning labels on cigarette packages.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced an anti-smoking measure
that focuses chiefly on education efforts and regulation of tobacco
product ingredients.
   Sullivan said that while he supported the intent of most of the
legislation, he believes it duplicates efforts already under way.
   Though Sullivan has always opposed smoking, his campaign against
tobacco companies is relatively new for him.
   In September 1987, while serving on an advisory board of the
National Cancer Institute, Sullivan presented to the board a report
on a National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer that advised
education as the key weapon rather than ``a frontal attack on the
tobacco companies.''
   Asked about this change of strategy, Sullivan pointed to a new
government report estimating that smoking costs the nation about
$52 billion annually, largely in increased health-care and
insurance costs.

<HEAD>Pertini, Former Socialist Preisdent of Italy Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandro Pertini, the beloved former Socialist
president, symbol of integrity and World War II hero, died in his
sleep at the age of 93 and was eulogized Sunday for his honesty and
forthright style.
   Pertini died late Saturday at his apartment in central Rome,
Italian media reported.
   No cause of death was given, but Pertini suffered a concussion
after falling and hitting his head in early February. He refused to
be taken to a hospital, insisting he wanted to die at home.
   The Cabinet, led by Premier Giulio Andreotti, met in special
session Sunday and ordered flags flown at half-staff during the
next two days. In accordance with Pertini's wishes, no state
funeral will be held.
   Pertini will be cremated in Rome on Monday morning and his ashes
taken on the presidential plane to his birthplace outside Savona,
near Genoa, for a private funeral service, the ANSA news agency
reported.
   Also in keeping with Pertini's wishes, his successor as
president, Francesco Cossiga, was the only visitor to the apartment
on Sunday, paying a half-hour call representing ``all Italians.''
   ``The nation is lucky to be defended by men such as Sandro
Pertini,'' Cossiga said.
   Pope John Paul, in a condolence message, recalled his ``warm
friendship'' with Pertini, especially after the pontiff was shot in
1981 and Pertini kept a vigil outside John Paul's hospital room.
   Pertini once joked to reporters that he didn't know whether
there was a heaven, but if one existed he was sure to get in and
``Pope Wojtyla (John Paul) will give me a push.''
   A founder of the Italian Socialist Party who spent nearly 10
years in fascist prisons, Pertini served as a president from 1978
to 1985, restoring prestige to the largely ceremonial post. He
served during Italy's successful fight against urban terrorism,
boosting morale and instilling a sense of pride.
   In the presidency, Pertini replaced Giovanni Leone, forced to
resign following unproven allegations of financial wrongdoing.
Installed at age 81, Pertini said: ``I am old, but I am not blind,
deaf or dumb.''
   Born outside the Italian Riviera town of Savona on Sept. 25,
1896, Pertini studied law and political science before fighting in
World War I.
   As a young man, he played a major role in building the Italian
Socialist Party.
   During the rise of fascism following World War I, Pertini was
imprisoned but escaped to France. In 1929, during the regime of
dictator Benito Mussolini, he was captured in northern Italy and
imprisoned again.
   Pertini spent nearly 10 years in prison before he escaped to
lead a resistance movement in northern Italy. The Nazis sentenced
him to death in 1943 but he eluded capture.
   Pertini was elected to Parliament after the war's end and
re-elected in the decades that followed.
   As president, Pertini refused to live in the Quirinal Palace,
keeping his apartment at the Trevi Fountain in Central Rome. During
his frequent walks, Pertini often stopped to talk to passers-by _ a
nightmare for his security detail.
   Pertini is survived by his wife, Carla.

   X X X existing borders.
   In the course of our talks, I have informed President Bush about
the situation in GDR and the talks I have had a couple of days ago
only with Secretary General Gorbachev. And I wish to seize this
opportunity, Mr. President, to thank you publicly today and here
before the press that, on the eve of my trip to Moscow, you sent me
a letter which did not only speak about supporting our policy and
was not only backed by the habitual friendship, but which will be
going down in history as an important document of German-American
friendship. Let me conclude by thanking you very much again for
your friendship and for the lovely hours we have been able to spend
with you here. I think this will mark our future cooperation as
well.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Helmut, if it's agreeable to you, might I
suggest to the press that we alternate the questions between us? Is
that agreeable with you, sir?
   Q (Question in German, partially translated) -- do you consider
the question of borders --
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: My answer is very clear, and I assure you --
(translation off mike) -- correctly. According to the legal
situation in our country, it is a freely elected parliament, the
sovereign of the people, which has to decide this question. And
this is laid down also in the treaties of 1970 and has been
mentioned in the conversations which took place in those years
again and again. past months that -- and I do want to repeat,
nobody wants to link the question of national unity with changes in
existing borders, and nobody is permitted to doubt my attitude
there.
   Q Do you consider it excluded that before German unity a treaty
be concluded with the Poles -- about the Polish border? Do you
consider this excluded?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: If I interpret the wish of the Polish
government correctly, and I think I do, then the Polish government
does have a very national wish that the competent sovereign, the
legally competent sovereign, take that decision. In Poland, there
are certain circles who wish that, before such a decision to be
adopted by an all-German parliament, decisions be taken in the two
German states. In the Federal German -- West German parliament --
we have already pronounced ourselves and confirmed our line about
the non-changing of borders.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Might I just add the US permission (sic) -- US
position, with your permission, Mr. Chancellor. The US respects the
provisions of the Helsinki Final Act regarding the inviolability of
current borders in Europe. And the US formally recognizes the
current German-Polish border. I just wanted to get that in. Yes,
Craig?
   Q Do you think there is some difference between what you have
just said and what the Chancellor said? There seems to be some lack
-- a bit of equivocation on his part. Do you think there is any
difference in the US view and what the Chancellor is saying today?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I think we're in alignment. I did not -- I would
not interpret what he said as equivocating at all. And I have just
given you the US position.
   Q Mr. President, can you explain for us --
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Okay, let's take this, then we'll be two each,
and then I think out courtesy we should alter them. Yeah, Charlie?
   Q Can you explain for us at this stage precisely how the
two-plus-four works? What the sequencing is, whether they are
consecutive and -- (inaudible) -- There's been so much confusion
about that. Who's got what rights?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, that -- those details have not been fully
worked out in terms of timings of meetings and things of this
nature. They have not been worked out. This formula was approved by
the foreign ministers in Ottawa, and we simply have not tried to
sit here in Camp David and fine tune the procedures for the
two-plus-four. You got a follow-up? I'm not sure I was responsive,
Charlie.
   Q Well, I'm not sure that I know any more than when you started
and that may be part of the problem here, that it is not clear
whether the Germans hold their meetings simultaneous with you,
whether you're in adjacent rooms, whether you run back and forth --

<TEXT>
   Free speech advocates say access to the public
soapbox is at stake Monday in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court
involving two Lyndon LaRouche followers who tried to solicit
support on a post office sidewalk.
   The court's decision will either broaden access to government
property for the purpose of free speech or further restrict what
constitutes a public forum.
   The case will also allow the court to clarify conflicting
rulings from federal appeals courts on the government's ban on
soliciting on Postal Service property.
   Groups such as the Hare Krishnas, conservative Christians, the
AFL-CIO and newspapers have filed friend-of-the-court briefs urging
that free speech rights be expanded.
   ``The public forum doctrine is for the little person,'' said
attorney Jay Sekulow. ``Missionaries and evangelicals cannot afford
full-page newspaper ads. They can afford a sidewalk to talk to
people about the gospel.''
   Sekulow represents Marsha Kokinda and Kevin Pearl, LaRouche
volunteers who were convicted of violating a regulation against
``soliciting, electioneering, collecting debts, vending and
advertising'' on Postal Service property.
   LaRouche, a political extremist and sometime presidential
candidate, is serving a 15-year prison term for his 1988 conviction
on fraud and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors accused him of
conspiring to accept millions of dollars in loans from political
supporters he had no intention of repaying.
   Courts have wrestled with a number of cases in recent years
seeking to define a ``public forum'' where speech cannot be
unreasonably restricted. Judges have been asked to decide, for
example, whether taxpayer-financed airline terminals or private
shopping malls can bar people from handing out leaflets or asking
for contributions.
   Kokinda and Pearl chose as their soapbox a narrow strip of
sidewalk leading between the parking lot and the doors of the tiny
post office on a busy highway in this Washington suburb. They were
arrested in 1986 after they refused to stop soliciting
contributions and distributing literature from a table.
   Kokinda was fined $50 and sentenced to 10 days in jail. Pearl
was fined $100. Their convictions were thrown out by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in 1989.
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday and is expected to
issue a decision by July.
   In appealing to the high court, the government argues that there
is a difference between a city sidewalk and one located entirely on
Postal Service property. It also argues that picketing, handing out
pamphlets and soliciting interfere with postal business. And a
Justice Department attorney will argue Monday that free speech is
limited to some extent on all government property.
   The 4th Circuit ruling is binding in Maryland, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
   But two other appeals courts have upheld the ban on soliciting
on post office property, so there is no nationwide standard for the
Postal Service to follow.
   David Liberman, an attorney for the International Society of
Krishna Consciousness, said the Postal Service is isolating its
property from other government buildings that are considered public.
   ``Where do you find the people these days? A suburban post
office is where you find the people. If this is not a forum, then
the government can exclude everything from that place,'' he said.

   X X X and forth.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No -- no, those details have not been worked
out. And it would be wrong for the United States to try to sit on
its own and work out with the German Chancellor all these technical
matters that involve others. So we did not get into those details
here today.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I would like to make a brief remark about the
subject, all the more so since I don't believe that there is any
reason for considering the situation with -- (inaudible) -- first.
I'm very happy with the decision adopted in Ottawa --
two-plus-four. It is only natural that the two states in Germany,
in particular after the 18th of March elections in GDR, will be
discussing the subject in a particular way. This is a subject which
concerns the Germans in particular. But I spoke about the two
tracks a moment ago along which things have to proceed. We will
then, at the level of two-plus- four, have to discuss things very
frankly. And we're not trying to exclude anybody -- that was sort
of the background of what you were saying -- but we will have to
discuss things in every necessary detail. And I think that is
possible within a reasonable time frame.
   Q (In German.)
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: If we talk to one another, this is a -- we have
a good chance of understanding one another.
   Q Mr. President, -- (inaudible) -- how do the Poles come into
this so that -- are they just one of the 35 at the end of it?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, there was -- I know of Poland's feeling to
want to make two-plus-four into two-plus-five. Is that what you're
asking about? The two-plus-four has been agreed upon. Clearly, no
agreement would ever be reached that affects the Polish borders
without Polish involvements, but there is no change -- we don't sit
up here and try to change an agreement that was taken by several
countries at Ottawa. But there will be a lot of consultative
mechanisms --
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: Ja.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: -- to deal with the interests -- not just of
Poland but of our allies and everyone else. And the Chancellor is
very good about that, and I hope we've been good about it, and it
is essential that we stay on the same wavelength with our allies
and friends. Excuse me, Helmut. I interrupted you, sir.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: Let me underpin what the President just said. I
do realize that there is a particular interest on the part of the
Poles. And I'm certain that in the course of this process, we will
find ways and means of adopting solutions satisfactory to
everybody. I think everyone of us has a feeling that there is a
particular situation there but I don't consider it useful that the
two of us, while nobody else from among our partners is here, try
and decide about things and make declarations today.
   Q (Off mike) -- Europe, from Poland to Britain, and our own
former Director of Intelligence, Mr. Helms, has called the German
unification march a runaway freight train. Given the history that
-- the role that Germany played in the two wars in this century,
shouldn't there be some assurances before this marriage takes place
on borders and security?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I think all those matters will be discussed in
the various consultative mechanisms that we brought up. But I
prefer to look at Germany's 45 years of contribution to democracy
and to the security of the West, and that's what we are focusing
on. I have stated the US position, which is not to be afraid of
German reunification, but to understand when peoples -- brother on
one side, brother on another -- want to get together as one
country, as they were before this artificial division that was --
that was -- resulted as -- out of World War II. So, we've already
crossed that bridge. We welcome reunification. But it's not for the
United States to set a timetable. It's not for us to say how fast.
It is for us to guarantee as best we can in consultation with our
allies that whatever evolves will be stable, and that peace will be
the result. So, I -- I've already given you the view in my
statement about the US toward unification. And we are not in a
process of trying to speed it up or slow it down. It's a matter for
the German people, matter for the discussions that -- that will be
taking place in multilateral fora.

   Guerrilla commanders admitted
Sunday they have suffered major battlefield losses to government
troops and blamed a halt in weapons shipments from China, their
main supplier.
   It remains unclear if the cut-off, confirmed by Western
diplomats in Bangkok, is because of logistical problems or a policy
decision by the Chinese government.
   On Friday, government troops rolled into the strategic,
guerrilla-held town of Svay Chek. Guerrilla leaders said Sunday
they were unable to make a stand at a second important town, Tmar
Puok, because of a shortage of ammunition.
   ``We cannot defend Tmar Puok. It looks very bad right now,''
said a senior commander of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. The front is allied with the Communist Khmer Rouge and a
group loyal to guerrilla coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The commander said the front abandoned its civilian
administration headquarters in Tmar Puok, which had served 50,000
civilians as a ``liberated zone'' since guerrillas seized it in
September.
   The guerrilla coalition stepped up its offensive against the
government in the fall after Vietnam claimed to have withdrawn its
last troops and ended an 11-year military intervention.
   Repeated attempts to establish a formula for peace have failed.
   A plan that would have the United Nations run Cambodia until
elections is expected to be discussed in three days of informal
talks that begin Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   A Western analyst on the Thai border estimated 15,000 civilians
would flee to the Thai frontier if Tmar Puok fell. Thousands have
already left areas of fighting and were moving closer to the
border, analysts said.
   The guerrillas seized a large swath of territory along the Thai
border following the Vietnamese withdrawal. The reversal came as
Sihanouk ended 11 years of exile on Friday, saying he would live in
villages northeast of the current fighting.
   Officials and refugees at Site B, located along the
Thai-Cambodian border, said Sihanouk's return was a boost to morale
among the more than 50,000 camp residents.
   ``We'll win now,'' 51-year-old refugee Kim Lay said Sunday at
Site B, the principal refugee camp for Sihanouk's followers.
   But a recent defector from Khmer Rouge forces at the camp said
the group's fighting ability was hurt by a sharp drop in weapons
and other supplies from China about two months ago.
   ``Before, China used to support us 100 percent, now it's only 50
percent. There is even a lack of food _ its not like it was
before,'' said Hem Khaem, a 25-year-old former Khmer Rouge company
commander. ``We were told in meetings that we had to save
everything. ...The principle was one bullet should kill one person
and if you couldn't get a good shot, don't shoot.''
   The front received its last shipment of Chinese weapons in early
December, according to diplomatic and guerrilla sources. Some
guerrilla commanders have said the cut-off was to force the
coalition to work more closely together.
   The front and Sihanouk's forces are deeply suspicious of the
Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its three-year rule. The Vietnamese invasion of 1978 ousted
the Khmer Rouge.
   The peace plan on the agenda in Jakarta, proposed by Australia
and supported by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, appears to offer the best hope of ending the bloody
conflict.
   Attending the talks will be the four Cambodian factions;
Vietnam; Laos; France; and representatives of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations _Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

   People have been moving into mountain lion country
in Coal Creek Canyon west of Boulder for 30 years, but now there
are enough people there that the big cats are becoming accustomed
to them _ and getting bolder.
   Pets have been killed there before, but so far this winter,
mountain lions have killed three dogs on their owners' property.
One was leashed and one was in an enclosure. One of the dogs was a
Labrador retriever and one a German shepherd.
   The owner of a Doberman pinscher heard a commotion behind his
house and found a mountain lion attacking the dog. When confronted
by the human, the cat calmly walked away. The dog was hospitalized.
   Twenty miles from the canyon, a mountain lion last week
apparently killed three llamas at a ranch. A private hunter killed
a mountain lion in the canyon.
   Residents fear the next victims may be children walking to
school bus stops before sunup _ prime hunting time for the big
cats, also known as cougars or pumas.
   ``We're not trying to get people paranoid, but they are living
in lion habitat. They can be taught to be lion smart, just as city
kids have to be taught to be street smart. If kids are too young to
be lion smart, they shouldn't be outside alone,'' said Kathi
Demarest, a state wildlife biologist.
   ``We are not going to kill lions just because people are afraid
of them. We are not going back to the 1870s when lions were killed
for a bounty.''
   Several hundred people live in the canyon on scattered home
sites. Wildlife officials have begun a series of meetings with them
to educate them about living in lion country.
   ``People tell us they live in the Colorado mountains because of
the wildlife. My goal is to teach people to appreciate the wildlife
and live with it,'' Demarest said.
   She estimated five to 45 pmas remain in the canyon area.
   The cats are tawny colored with a black tip on the tail. An
adult can grow to more than 7 feet from nose to tip of tail and
weigh upwards of 150 pounds. Its method of attack is to lie in
ambush, then leap on the back of its prey and bite through the
skull or neck for the kill. Their main prey is deer.
   Kristi Coughlon, a state wildlife manager in the Boulder
district, said there have been three confirmed mountain lion kills
of dogs, another dog injured and several unconfirmed pet kills and
missing pets this winter. However, coyotes also take dogs and cats
and landowners kill dogs, she said.
   If any of the mountain lions become aggressive toward humans,
state trackers can be brought in to kill them, she said. Some
people have obtained special state permits to kill cougars that
have killed dogs.
   Until recent years, there had never been a confirmed, unprovoked
mountain lion attack on a human in this country.
   That changed with mass human encroachment upon lion habitat. A
child was killed by a lion in Montana and a child was injured and
another killed in an Orange County, Calif., wildlife refuge,
authorities said. There have also been mountain lion attacks in
Arizona and Texas.
   Parents ``must start taking their kids to the bus stop, install
a light at the bus stop, clear brush away from the area, don't let
kids play alone near brush and install fenced play areas for
kids,'' Demarest said.
   Many city people unwittingly do things that put them ``on a
clear collision course with wildlife,'' such as putting out salt
blocks for deer, she said.
   ``They're just setting themselves up for lion trouble,'' she
said.
   Mountain residents should bring their pets in at night along
with pet food, and not leave out garbage, because it attracts wild
animals, she said.
   ``We hope to develop a system that has lions tolerating people
and people tolerating lions,'' Demarest said.

<HEAD>Retired General Harbors Bitterness Over Iran-Contra Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard V. Secord refers to the Iran-Contra
prosecutors as ``this gang'' and yearns to go after the lawyers who
prosecuted him for his role in setting up a private network to
supply arms to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The prosecutors are none too fond of the retired Air Force major
general, either, and would like to reinstate charges dropped in a
plea bargain agreement.
   Still unclear is what impact the mutual rancor will have on
Secord's role in the case against former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter.
   ``As far as I know I'm not on the witness list yet,'' Secord
said in an interview in which he vented his anger at Iran-Contra
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh and his staff.
   ``A day of reckoning is coming for this gang,'' said Secord.
   But the retired military officer also conceded he's had little
success raising money for the fund he established to ``go after''
Walsh and challenge the Ethics in Government Act. Secord said his
ultimate goal is to overturn the law which authorizes appointment
of special prosecutors.
   Secord, 57, a native of Columbus, Ohio, flew bombing missions in
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict. He held a number of
high-ranking positions at the Pentagon before he retired. A short,
square-jawed man with a wry sense of humor and a blunt way of
talking, Secord can also be pugnacious when challenged.
   After he pleaded guilty to making a false statement to
congressional investigators, he was expected to play a role in the
prosecution of Poindexter on charges of concealing facts from
Congress and lying about a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran _
a shipment in which Secord was involved.
   As part of a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors, Secord
agreed to cooperate fully on future cases. Eleven other criminal
charges were dropped and he walked away from the federal courthouse
on Jan 24 with a suspended sentence after paying $50 in court costs.
   The day after Secord was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Aubrey
Robinson, he filed an appeal on the grounds that Walsh didn't have
jurisdiction to prosecute for an offense arising out of Secord's
testimony to Congress.
   Walsh's staff retaliated by claiming Secord acted in ``bad
faith'' by agreeing to plead guilty while all the time planning to
challenge the plea.
   Prosecutors asked Robinson to reinstate the 11 charges against
Secord.
   Asked why he filed an appeal _ and risked facing charges again _
Secord said, ``My wife asked me the same question _ she just wants
it to end.''
   In the final analysis, Secord said he wants to repair his
reputation.
   ``My reputation has been so damaged by the special prosecutor
... This isn't a special prosecutor; it's a P.R. outfit.''
   Secord said he hasn't seen the prosecutors in a month. ``I
haven't even seen one of them,'' though he said he had talked with
them earlier.
   That doesn't mean he won't be called to testify in a Poindexter
trial. ``With these guys (prosecutors) you never know,'' said the
man who set up a private network to supply weapons to the
Nicaraguan Contras at a time when Congress had banned official U.S.
military aid for the rebels.
   Secord also arranged for the shipment of weapons to Iran and
directed companies into which profits from those sales were placed.
   Sam Witucki, a spokeswoman for Walsh, said prosecutors don't
discuss witnesses and other details in advance of a trial.
   As for the upcoming Poindexter trial, Secord said he didn't have
any contact with Poindexter about the shipment of Hawk missiles to
Iran in November 1985.
   ``His name was never mentioned,'' he said.
   Secord said he tried to arrange the shipment of the Hawks from
Israel through Portugal to Iran at North's behest.
   ``North called after talking to (former national security
adviser Robert) McFarlane,'' he said.
   When McFarlane resigned as the NSC adviser in December 1985, he
was replaced by Poindexter. Secord said the first time he met with
Poindexter was in January 1986.
   ``The Hawk shipment took place on McFarlane's watch _ not
Poindexter's,'' Secord said.

<HEAD>Anti-Semitism in Soviet Union Increases, Prompting Jewish Exodus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasingly open acts of anti-Semitism have
scared thousands of Soviet Jews out of their homeland, where they
fear becoming targets of ethnic violence.
   Many immigrants arriving in Israel speak of their fears, even
though most say they have not witnessed anti-Semitic acts or been
personally threatened.
   But they have read widely circulated anti-Semitic magazines and
have seen reports in newspapers or on television referring to plans
for pogroms by anti-Jewish groups.
   ``Once, we laughed at the rumors that there may be a pogrom,''
said Elena Kopelevitch, a 30-year-old pianist from Odessa who
arrived in Israel two weeks ago. ``But now, there's an anti-Jewish
hysteria, and it's like a snowball.''
   Israeli officials expect as many as 750,000 Jews to eventually
leave the Soviet Union because of more liberal exit policies.
   While Jews also are leaving to seek economic opportunity or
because they doubt the new freedom in the Soviet Union will last,
racism is another factor.
   Immigrants noted attacks on Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital
of Baku in January and in Uzbekistan's Fergana valley, where Uzbeks
last June killed more than 100 Meshkhetian Turks.
   In such cases, authorities failed to protect the minorities, the
Soviet Jews say. There is widespread fear the Jewish minority would
not be protected in case of trouble, they say.
   ``We have not witnessed any direct anti-Semitism but we lived in
fear,'' said Elena Kopelevitch's brother Danny, a student.
   At the house of friends, a mixed Armenian-Jewish family, Ms.
Kopelevitch said he met an Armenian refugee from Baku, an
85-year-old woman who ``looked terrible ... she was covered with
blue marks and bruises from beatings.''
   ``I'm still trembling as I recall it. We did not want to wait
for the same fate,'' she said.
   Anti-Semitism is not a new experience for Soviet Jews. In the
late 1940s and early 1950s, Josef Stalin ordered leading Soviet
Jewish writers and actors killed and initiated anti-Semitic trials.
   An anti-Zionist campaign, with clear anti-Semitic overtones,
also followed the Soviet Union's break in diplomatic ties with
Israel after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Much of the government-sponsored anti-Semitism has disappeared
in the five years of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, but
liberalized rules also have unleashed grassroots anti-Semitism.
   Vladimir Nosenko of Moscow's Insitute of World Economy and
International Relations, visiting Israel, pointed to unofficial
anti-Semitism as a cause for Jewish fears.
   ``Imagine a country where emerging movements and parties accuse
the Jews of causing all the trials and tribulations of the natives,
and call for the extermination of `Jewish dominance' for the sake
of a better future,'' he wrote in the Jerusalem Post.
   Nosenko said that several periodicals ``specialize in publishing
material which plays on anti-Jewish emotion.''
   Much of the open anti-Semitism is spearheaded by factions of
National-Patriotic Pamyat Front.
   A Pamyat manifesto reported by the newpaper ``Soviet Circus'' in
October said Stalin's repressions in the 1930s were ``Zionist
genocide (that) killed more people in our country than in all the
wars of mankind.''
   Last week the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said Moscow
prosecutors have begun criminal proceedings against Pamyat on
charges of ``inciting national and racial hatred and strife.''
   ``It is very frightening to be a Jew in the Soviet Union these
days,'' said Kira Nefyodova, a chemist from Leningrad.
   Soviet Jews were particularly worried by a Jan. 18 attack on
April, a liberal group of Soviet writers. About 50 Pamyat activists
holding signs saying ``Moscow is not Tel Aviv'' broke into an April
meeting.
   According to a tape transcript printed by the liberal Ogonyok
weekly, a Pamyat member who identified himself as Smirnov shouted
at the writers through a megaphone:
   ``Yids and Masons, get out of the hall ... comrade Jews, leave
the hall ... your time has ran out, and neither police, nor KGB or
the party will help you. Now we shall rule the country and you,
aliens, get out to Israel.''
   Participants in the April meeting later complained that police
took no action.
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who visited Moscow last
month, has said that in his six visits he had never seen Jews
``living and dwelling in such fear.''
   Wiesel called on Gorbachev to personally condemn the growing
anti-Semitism, but no government condemnation followed. In private
meetings, Soviet leaders assured some Western guests they would not
tolerate any pogroms.
   Maya Kaganskaya, a Soviet-born author and researcher on
anti-Semitism affiliated with Jerusalem's Hebrew University, said
Soviet authorities cannot openly condemn anti-Semitic forces that
seem to enjoy mass support.
   ``These people are supported by hundreds of thousands ... while
there is no social base for the so-called liberals,'' she said in
an interview.
   ``Therefore the authorities want to the remove explosive
material, the Jews, by encouraging them to leave,'' she said. They
don't want Russia covered with Jewish blood.''

<HEAD>Rocky Statue May Lose Bout With Art Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks as if Rocky Balboa has lost his
bout with Philadelphia's art museum.
   The 8-foot, 6-inch statue of the fictional South Philadelphia
palooka is scheduled to leave its spot atop the Philadelphia Museum
of Art steps Monday for its former home at the Spectrum arena,
museum spokeswoman Sandra Horrocks said Sunday.
   The statue of Rocky in boxing trunks and gloves, his arms raised
in triumph, was moved from the Spectrum for the filming of the
latest chapter in Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky'' saga. Producers of
``Rocky V'' had agreed to remove the statue, a prop made for
``Rocky III,'' by Monday.
   But Stallone and fans of the underdog boxer tried to persuade
the museum to keep the bronze cast on the spot made so famous in
the original ``Rocky'' that tourists regularly run up the steps and
hop around the plaza in Rocky fashion.
   Polls by a local TV station and a newspaper show residents about
equally split on the issue. Mayor W. Wilson Goode came out in favor
of leaving the statue put, saying it serves as a great tourist
attraction.
   Stallone hired a lawyer, former state boxing commissioner James
Binns, to try to persuade the Fairmount Park Commission, which
oversees the museum, to allow the statue to stay. Binns was
returning from Venezuela on Sunday and could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   But art museum officials say the statue is out of place.
President Robert Montgomery Scott said it looks puny in front of
the big Greco-Roman building and its columns.
   Art museum officials said the statue was to be moved by Jan. 31,
but that deadline was extended to allow additional filming for the
movie.
   The statue has been moved between the sports arena and the
museum for almost eight years. It was made by the A. Thomas
Schomberg Foundry in 1981 for the ``Rocky'' sequel and left there
after the movie opened in 1982.
   That time, museum officials said Stallone failed to remove the
statue as agreed, and the museum had to pay $12,000 to move it to
the Spectrum.

   X X X multilateral fora.
   Q (Inaudible) --
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: Just a second, let me say something about this,
because this is a very central question -- I am grateful that was
put. The question of German unity is a question of self -- right of
self-determination, and all peoples of this earth have the right of
self-determination. It's part of the charge of the United Nations,
it corresponds to the principles of CSCE, it corresponds to the
major democratic traditions of our world. In all documents, all
treaties which have been concluded with the Federal Republic, the
will to re-find -- reform the -- your idea of the German nation had
always been confirmed. The second point is that the people in the
two parts of Germany do want to unify -- want to overcome the
articles of division. The people in the GDR, in a peaceful
revolution, I think the most peaceful revolution of history, have
made it clear that they want it by shouting, ``We are the people!
We are one people!'' Now if I have a particular feeling, seeing and
hearing this, and I believe that we do have a responsibility to be
conscious of the fact that we are situated, geographically
speaking, in the center of Europe. We have a certain history. We
must understand that there are certain fears on the part of our
neighbors, and I'm talking about serious fears and not only the
pretended fears because there are people who pretend they have
fears, but what they mean is that they fear the economic power of a
Federal Republic plus GDR. The President very rightly said last
year the Federal Republic was 40 years of age. In the course of 40
years, it was a loyal and reliable partner in human rights and the
defense of freedom. In 1983, I put my political existence at stake
by agreeing that arms be deployed, NATO arms -- American arms and
missiles -- be deployed on German soil. So nobody has to tell me
what a reliable partner is. But I do take all the other data into
consideration. And I've also made it clear -- that's part of my
answer to you -- that I am amongst those who want to pursue
political union of Europe. The Federal government is a government
which is ready to delegate further competences to the European
parliament. In other words, we want this united Germany to be ever
more embedded in an integration process with its neighbors. So
nobody needs to be afraid. And as regards the economic strength, I
can only say that the European Community has been able to draw a
great advantage of the economic strength of the Federal Republic
and will be able to draw even more advantage from the economic
strength of a united Germany.
   Q I'm sorry, did you recognize --
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I did, but go ahead -- take the two --
   Q Mr. President, I'd like to know perhaps the core question, do
you trust that Germany will never become an aggressive, resurgent
military power? And if I might ask Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kohl, do you
foresake such a posture?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I have stated that the US position is that we
welcome unification. And clearly, that would not be the position if
we held the fears that your question alluded to. I do think that
one way to help with stability, not in relation to this question,
but European peace and stability is to have a strong NATO and to
have US troops, if wanted, stationed in Europe. But our policy --
if I shared the fears that you're talking about, clearly we would
-- might well have a different policy. Norm -- I -- let me take
this one, Chancellor, because I recognized two at once and the --
   Q (Off-mike) -- to Chancellor Kohl, how durable can we see the
commitment to NATO and the continued presence of US troops on
German soil given the broad support in the Federal Republic right
now for a neutral unified Germany, given the probable outcome of
the East German elections and given some of the political pressures
that you may come under later this year with elections in December?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: It's my affair, these elections in the Federal
Republic of Germany in December, and I'm looking forward to them
very calmly. A moment ago I gave you the example, had I been
standing here in the autumn, in the fall of 1982 or in January
1982, most of your colleagues would have doubted that the Germans
would deploy. We did deploy American missiles, and that is why I
really don't think we need to be told what reliability means.
Neutralism would be a very false solution for us. I don't -- I
can't see that there would ever be any majority in the Federal
Republic nor in a united Germany for a neutralized Germany. I think
we have learned lessons and we do not want to repeat the errors of
history; but one mistake in the times of the Weimar Republic, of
course, was that Germany was isolated in Europe. One must make
Germany a part of the whole.
   Q How would you assess the results of your -- (rest of question
untranslated) -- and I would like to ask the same question to the
President.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I don't think that this was our subject really.
Actually, I must say I don't quite understand this discussion on
who accelerates and who does the contrary. At one point in time, I
proposed these ten points. At that time, the situation was quite
different. In November, and that is only a couple of weeks back, we
had thought that on the path towards Germany unity, we would be
able to take certain steps, that we would have an opportunity of
concluding this contractual community first and then go -- have
further joint structures and then have a confederation. It is the
attitude of the people in GDR and their exodus which has
accelerated things. You must consider the fact that between the
first of January and today, some 110,000 people have left the GDR
to come over to the Federal Republic. I think that equals the
figure of inhabitants of Philadelphia in the matter of eight weeks.
So this movement must be stopped. That is why I made this offer of
concluding a monetary union in order to stop this movement, in
order to hold people back, in order to make them stay at home. If
you ask me, we now need a possibility of proceeding along this path
towards unity step-by-step with good judgment. We need this for
ourselves. We also need this because of our neighbors, because the
dynamism which has been caused now has been caused by the people in
GDR, but not because anybody wanted to accelerate that movement. I
do hope that in a few days, that is to say shortly after the 18th
of March, the newly elected parliament will soon form a government
with whom we can agree on how we want to proceed. But I am not
interested in this being so very fast.

   X X X very fast.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: He asked, gentlemen, the German press asked
that, I guess -- I thought he said for both of us to comment on the
nature of the -- of the talks. You know, in diplomacy they always
say ``full and frank,'' and you can interpret that any way that you
want. But the benefit of this kind of meeting for me is, you can
talk in a very informal setting about any subject at all. And the
relationship that I have personally with Chancellor Kohl and that
the Federal Republic has with the United States, enables us to talk
very frankly. But what I come out with, in addition to this
statement that I made, is the importance to keep our allies
involved. I believe the Chancellor shares with me the importance of
the United States and the Soviet Union staying in very close touch.
I know he shares with me the importance of our making progress with
the Soviets on arms control and on other areas. So, as this meeting
winds down, it was extraordinarily frank. We can talk, as one does
with friends, but we have so much common ground here, including how
we're looking at unification, and including the need to be sure
that it doesn't look like either one of us is dictating to allies'
security arrangements, or anything else for the future. So it was a
very good meeting.
   Q Mr. President, I wonder if each of you gentlemen could comment
on whether you would anticipate that a reunited Germany will see
fit to develop an independent nuclear weapons capability?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: No. This discussion is over in Germany. We are
not at all longing for atomic -- to be an atomic power.
   Q Mr. President --
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes --
   Q Mr. President, if I could follow up on a question you were
actually asked a week or two ago about who -- about who the enemy
is these days, it seems that less and less it is the Soviets. So,
would one purpose of having, keeping NATO intact and keeping US
troops within NATO in Germany be to -- as some analysts have said
-- to keep the Germans down?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No. The enemy is unpredictability, the enemy is
instability, and it is for that reason that we -- there are agreed
security provisions, and that's -- that's the answer to it. Who out
here was smart enough to predict for fact certain the changes that
have taken place any time in the last year? Certainly no one up
here -- maybe Chancellor Kohl, but not the President of the United
States. And so, what -- what I think we want to do in a period of
exciting change is to have a stable Western Europe. The Eastern
European countries are throwing off the yoke of communism. The
policy of NATO has prevailed. The Soviet Union is engaged in
dramatic change, but nobody can predict for fact certain what will
come. And so what we want to do is use our good offices and our
alignment with NATO to help with stability, and that is in the
interest of the United States of America. Some are saying in our
country -- and the Chancellor and I talked about this -- well, we
ought to take all the troops out; or some are saying take all
Soviet troops out and all US forces out of Europe. In my judgment,
that would not provide for a stable Europe. And so it's back to
your question: The enemy is instability and unpredictability as
this rapid change continues to unfold inside the Soviet Union and
inside Eastern Europe.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I would like to join up with this term,
``instability.'' I think this is one of the major tasks of all
those responsible in East and West, and it's particularly true for
us in Germany. We must do everything possible in order to avoid
destabilization in Europe, in particular in Eastern Europe. I will
do whatever I can to respond to that aim. As a matter of fact, I do
not only agree with the President on this, but also with Secretary
General Gorbachev. Regarding the relationship between NATO and the
Federal Republic, you seem to have made a mistake on your calendar.
We are not -- this is not 1945, this is 1990.
   Q Mr. Chancellor --
   Q Mr. President, on the -- going back to what you were saying
before about keeping allies informed, would you like to see a NATO
summit called together to discuss the unification?

   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I will let Chancellor Kohl also respond to
that. I don't think at this juncture we need a NATO summit. Jim
Baker just had a very successful and forward-looking meeting up in
Ottawa, and I don't -- I wouldn't say that what's called for now is
a NATO summit. We're talking about a CSCE summit, provided there's
a CFE agreement. I have, as the Chancellor knows, and we discussed
this, a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in the late spring,
we have a G-7 meeting. So we've got all kinds of consultative
mechanisms set up in addition to the two-plus-four. And there'll be
a lot of bilateral talks, and maybe the Chancellor would like to
respond about the need for NATO in concert to do more. But the big
point is, keep each other informed. And I don't think it has to be
done at a NATO summit because I think most NATO allies share common
ground. There's a concern here or a different suggestion there, but
generally speaking, I think we're pretty much on the same
wavelength with our allies. Did you
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I fully agree with what the President has just
said, but let me elaborate on that. What is happening now to many
is a suprisingly new situation, including for those who have always
talked about it but never thought the day would really come. Now
the day is coming. That is why it is so important that we talk to
one another as much as possible so that there be no mistrust, and
that is particularly I agree that this is not the time to convene a
NATO summit, but I do agree that we need many detailed
conversations within the European Community. On the 28th of April,
we will have an informal summit, an extra summit, just as we have
had it in Paris in the beginning of December. The forthcoming one
is going to take place in Dublin, Ireland. Now having the
presidency I will inform people there. I will also be at the
disposal of the representatives of the NATO member states. I have
had and I will be having a number of contacts. Not long ago I met
with my Italian, Luxembourg, Dutch colleagues in Italy. Before I
came here, I called my friend Mulroney. I had a long telephone
conversation with him. What matters to me is that we make it clear
that we play very frankly and fairly and want to cooperate with all
our friends and partners and the result will be good.
   Q (Translation off-mike) -- and Mr. President, do you think that
at the end of a two-plus-four process there will be a peace treaty
-- and that a peace treaty will then no longer be necessary?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I can give a very simple answer to your first
-- to the first part of your question. Yes.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: And we agree with that. And eventually the four
powers that were set up right at the end of the war, that'll have
to be resolved. Whether it requires a formal treaty or something of
that nature, I'm not sure. But there will be a resolution, so there
will not be a continued need for this four-power arrangement,
looking over the shoulders of a democratic unified Germany. On the
aisle back here.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: Just a minute, he wasn't next -- that one.
   Q Mr. Chancellor, what needs to be done in the event that the
Soviet Union will not agree to Germany being a member of NATO?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: We talked about many things, and also about
what we want to discuss, we need to discuss with the Soviet Union.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: We will do what Lyndon Johnson did, we will
reason together. And it'll all work out. Yes, on the aisle.
   Q Mr. President, with apologies to your guest, a question on
another subject. If Daniel Ortega is elected in Nicaragua today
will the United States deal with him as the legitimate leader of
Nicaragua? What will your policy be, sir?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: The policy will be right -- short range to wait
and see how free, how fair the election is. I don't know whether
this is going live into Managua, but the last thing I want to do is
make any hypothesis about the -- a victory of that sort because our
view is we'd be better off with those who have professed democracy
as the route to go. And so I will cross that bridge, however, when
we get there. However, let me say this. If these elections are
certifiably free and fair, it will -- whoever wins the election
will find a better climate in which to improve relations with
Nicaragua. We've had difficulty because Nicaragua has said that
they're not giving arms to the FMLN. Now they say, well if we're
elected, we won't give arms to the FMLN. We -- there are certain
things that are unacceptable, not just to the United States, but to
other countries in this hemisphere. So we've got to see where we
go. But clearly a free and fair election that is certified as such,
in spite of the shortcomings that have reported to me by observers,
would be very, very helpful in this relationship.

   X X X this relationship.
   Q Would -- if I may follow, would such an election call for a US
response, an American initiative?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, again, it's too hypothetical because we've
got to know not only how an election works out but we also need to
know what follows on. I thought the Secretary of State put it very
well in testimony before Congress the other day when he said
``Look, there's got to be a period of establishing'' -- he didn't
put it this way, but I will -- a bonifides. And I would cite the
FMLN is one clear area where there should be change. A democratic
process is important, but what follows on, in terms of freedom of
the press, freedom of institutions there, freedom to protest,
freedom to speak your mind, is also important. And so all I'll say
is that whoever wins that election, if it is certifiably free and
fair, that's good. That's a positive thing, and we would certainly
take that into strong consideration, the will of the people having
been expressed, as we determine what steps next to take. But I
would love to see Nicaragua living peacefully within its own
borders, not trying to subvert its neighbors, and giving its people
a shot at democracy. And once all that was sorted out, why you can
-- I can guarantee you there'd be better relations with Nicaragua.
   Q Chancellor, you talked about elections in December. Seeing the
developments in Germany, can you foretell that it will be a federal
election, or an all-German election?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I do assume that we will have a federal
election as it corresponds to the Constitution.
   Q Have you talked about nuclear short-range missiles over the
weekend?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: We have talked about how the process should be
developed in the near future and how we will -- what decisions
we'll take with regard to the decisions taken in Brussels -- spring
last year.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: (Off-mike) -- over here.
   Q Mr. President, you said you were surprised that perhaps unity
was coming sooner than you yourself had expected. Do you believe
that those of your other allies within Europe who are cautious
about the pace of that unity, are wrong, ill-informed, or do they
not understand what you have been talking about?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I think they will rejoice in the agreements in
what we've said here today. I can understand individuals looking at
a problem in a different way. But I can tell you that the alliance
is pretty firmly together on the security matters. I think they're
going to be very firmly together on what the Chancellor has said
here today about -- said again about NATO membership. And so I
don't -- I can understand individual countries wanting
clarification or raising questions. This doesn't trouble us at all.
I have stated the United States' position, and I will keep
restating it, and I will be discussing this with -- with our
allies. But look, none of our allied leaders have predicted the
rapidity of this change, or the dynamics of the change in Eastern
Europe. And so, we're all trying to sort it out. But the main point
is not that there is not -- nuances of difference, but that there
is so much common ground as the way we look at the problems, and as
the way we look at it with the Federal Chancellor.
   Q Mr. President --
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yeah, back here in the middle.
   Q The question's for both leaders. I noticed in your opening
remarks you were more specific than the Chancellor in referring to
NATO. I wonder if that's an indication that there is some
discussion or perhaps some sentiment among the Germans that NATO
may somehow fade away or be transformed into a different kind of
European security arrangement, and whether that was discussed to
speak of.

   Miners return to work Monday at Pittston
Coal Group after a violent 10-month strike in Virginia, Kentucky
and West Virginia, with both sides saying it will take time for
tensions to ease.
   The 1,700 miners, who had been fighting the company as well as
the replacement workers and supervisors who kept it running during
the strike, on Feb. 19 ratified a settlement reached New Year's Eve
in Washington.
   Some miners returned to work Friday, but officials said most
will be coming back for the first time on Monday.
   ``It's going to be odd going back,'' miner Buford Mullins said.
``I don't think things can be as they were before the strike. It's
going to take a while.''
   Pittston President Michael Odom said, ``There will be some
tensions we will have to deal with.'' But he said the union
employees struck with enthusiasm and probably will come back to
work with enthusiasm.
   Violence erupted sporadically during the strike. Replacement
workers and supervisors were often pelted with rocks as they drove
to work and verbally abused when they went to town.
   The new contract gives union members the job security and health
and retirement benefits they sought and gives Pittston the ability
to run the mines seven days a week.

   X X X speak of.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we ourselves, Jerry, have talked about a
broader, or a slightly different role. Clearly, this stability,
through the military aspects, is part of it. But we've talked and
we talked up here with Manfred Woerner the other day about a
broader role for NATO. But I don't feel at the end of these talks
that the Chancellor and I are looking at this differently. I'll let
him -- if there are some nuances there, let him say so, but I don't
think so.
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I can only say this is a very natural thing,
that seeing the dramatic changes in the world with which we're
confronted -- think only of the Warsaw Pact and its present
situation. We are talking with the Warsaw Pact -- NATO versus
Warsaw Pact, United States versus Soviet Union -- we are talking
about our future. Manfred Woerner, when he was here, indicated,
quite rightly so, that the political importance of the NATO
alliance will increase. And I think this is important. And there
are quite a few people, including in the reformed states of Central
and East Europe, who do not feel threatened by NATO at all, but who
consider NATO as a fortress of stability and security. And one has
to take that into consideration when one talks about future
development. I'm quite optimistic there. Without developing these
ideas further, we will not make any headway in disarmament. And
this year, we do have the good chance of being able to make headway
in disarmament. I do not think that this is the time for pessimism.
   Q Mr. Chancellor, the desire on both of your parts to have a
unified Germany remain in NATO -- you also said that there should
be some kind of special arrangements to guarantee -- provide
certain guarantees -- security guarantees for Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union. Does that preclude any participation at all with
a unified Germany vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact? And would it be
conceivable that there could actually be Soviet troops in a unified
Germany?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: One thing is clear: a united Germany cannot
belong to two different pact systems. The other point is a question
of sovereignty. We will have transition situations and that is the
subject about which one has to negotiate. At present, there are
380,000 soliders of the Soviet Army. Seeing the reductions one has
agreed upon, half of that number will be remaining there for the
time being. Many things will have to be looked into, and I cannot
and will not give any final position here. A united Germany, that
much is clear, has a sovereignty of its own, has its own
sovereignty. That is quite clear. But then in the transition
period, one can still think about things which will be helpful.
   Q Can you give any more details about what you discussed in
terms of providing these security assurances, beyond what you've
said so far?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: I don't think that is what a press conference
is about, because we first must negotiate and then have a press
conference about the results.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Let me ask -- I noticed Mr. Fitzwater looking
that we may have overextended our time -- would it be agreeable,
Chancellor Kohl, if we each took one more question?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: (In German.)
   Q Mr. President, can you envisage a situation where US troops
are still deployed in Germany while the Soviet Union has withdrawn
all its troops from German soil?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes, I can. And the reason I can envisage such a
situation is that, if that's what the Germans want, that's what
ought to happen. And we are not -- the US troops are not in Europe
against the will of any single country in which they're deployed.
Not one. And the Soviet troops have been, for years, inside the
territory of countries that haven't wanted them. This is a
fundamental difference. So my answer is yes, I can so envision.
   Q Mr. Chancellor, both of you have talked about US troops and
Soviet troops, but I'd like to ask a question about Germany's own
troops. Both the Federal Republic and East Germany -- the GDR have
substantial armies. I know a final decision about those armies
won't be made until a united Germany is formed, but as you look
ahead, what's your personal -- (audio break) -- to retain an army
of this size? Or in the future will it be likely that those forces
will be scaled down?
   CHANCELLOR KOHL: Let me say first of all, that's the question of
the strength of forces which concerns us directly, but this
question must be embedded in the overall situation, the overall
security development. And I do hope very much that in the area of
disarmament we will advance in leaps and bounds. And do I hope that
we Germans will be able to profit from that. That is why that --
why today I cannot answer that question, in particular, since I'm
not the representative of an all-German state. And I cannot tell
you at all in what dimensions a future German state would conceive
of these things. In this question as well, one has to consider the
effects that that will have -- that the answer will have on all our
neighbors. I have spontaneously answered to the questions put to me
by one of your colleagues. He asked, did we want to have nuclear
arms, and I spontaneously said no. And that is of greatest
importance -- there shouldn't be any fears in that direction. By
the way, this and many other questions I consider to be able to be
solved. We have had more difficult questions to solve, if I
consider legal questions of private property in GDR, the social
structure. So, the task ahead of us is enormous, and that is again
why I plead it shouldn't be under time pressure, but we should be
advancing and solving these problems step by step.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you all very, very much.

   A smoking ban on virtually all domestic U.S. flights took effect
Sunday amid both relief and grumbling, and the phrase ``Smoking or
non-smoking?'' all but disappeared from the lips of ticket agents.
   ``If the plane starts to go down, I'm lighting one up,'' said
Dave Noeth of New York City, a traveler at LaGuardia Airport.
   The federal ban, in force since 1988 on flights of less than two
hours, now applies to 99.8 percent of domestic flights _ the only
exception being flights to Alaska and Hawaii of more than six
hours. Overseas fights are not affected.
   ``It's wonderful. It's for the health of everyone,'' said
Eastern Airlines flight attendant Nancy Roberson of Charleston,
S.C. ``I think there are more pleased people than not. All the
passengers tell me about it.''
   Michael Barnett, an Eastern ticket agent in Miami, said the
elimination of smoking and non-smoking sections made his life a bit
easier. ``Now we just issue seats,'' he said.
   Supporters of the ban say separate smoking sections do not
adequately shield non-smoking passengers and crew members from
cigarette smoke. Critics argue that smokers' rights are being
trampled on.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said Gail Fiore of Huntington,
N.Y., as she arrived at LaGuardia. ``I pay the same fare as a
non-smoker and there should be a section for it. They're giving all
the non-smokers all the rights and taking away all of ours.''
   Added her husband, Hugo: ``Even in the service they gave you a
10-minute smoke break.''
   Other smokers took a more resigned approach, even if nicotine
withdrawal pangs are likely to bring new meaning to the term
white-knuckle flying.
   ``If they say you don't smoke, you don't smoke,'' said Rich
Meadows of Ridgecrest, Calif., as he awaited a Chicago-bound flight
at Los Angeles International Airport.
   ``I don't care for it, but that's the way it goes. I'll just
take some chewing tobacco, which makes the stewardesses mad. It's
pretty disgusting, but it's something to do.''
   Dan Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a lobbying
group, said last week that he had fielded many calls from
``miserable'' smokers.
   ``We are telling the people the law is the law,'' he said.
``We're telling people not to smoke in the bathroom. It's dangerous
to the plane.''
   Longtime smoker Joanne Sharples of Omaha, Neb., arriving in
Miami, said she managed not to light up during the flight. ``After
about three hours you get those anxiety pangs. But I've gone eight
hours,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sharples, who said she has tried four times to quit smoking
and plans to try again, said she understands non-smokers' desire to
breathe clean air.
   ``I wish they would do the same thing for women who wear an
abundance of perfume,'' she said. ``I can understand certainly a
smoke-free America, a drug-free America and a perfume-free
America!''
   Matthew Bowen, who was traveling from Atlanta to Norfolk, Va.,
to see his grandchildren, said smokers must lobby to protect
smoking areas. He said airlines would listen if smokers threatened
to take their money to competitors.
   ``I've smoked three cigarettes this morning just waiting for the
plane when I usually would smoke one,'' he said. He joked that he
was ``storing up.''

   The armed forces will receive new
uniforms as part of an effort to dissociate them from the
repressive rule of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
authorities were quoted as saying Sunday.
   The defense minister, Lt. Gen. Victor A. Stanculescu, told the
daily Romania Libera newspaper the uniforms would help give
soldiers a new identity.
   The military kept order during the repressive 24-year tenure of
Ceausescu but sided with civilians during the revolt that toppled
him in December.
   An officer displayed the new uniforms for different branches of
the armed forces Sunday on a television program devoted to military
affairs.
   Among other changes, the new army officers' uniforms have soft
epaulets similar to those used in the West, rather than the stiff,
detachable shoulder boards that are the style in Warsaw Pact
countries.
   Soldiers going on public patrols will be assigned smart belted
green jackets with shirts and ties, rather than the pullovers and
simple jackets currently issued, the program said.
   Television showed shiny black shoes that soldiers would wear on
patrol instead of combat boots and said fur-lined coats would be
provided in winter instead of the old wool ones now used.
   In a separate broadcast, television also reported that police
would receive new uniforms with a less militaristic look.
   The new uniforms appeared to be another effort by the interim
government to calm the restive armed forces, which launched a week
of demonstrations earlier this month demanding a purge of officers
linked to Ceausescu as well as the removal of the former defense
minister, Nicolae Militaru. Protesting soldiers also complained of
poor food and other supplies and a lowly image.
   In another response to the demands of young officers,
Stanculescu announced that 20 generals who had been called out of
retirement during the revolution had been removed from active duty,
Romania Libera reported.
   The demonstrators had charged that the 74-year-old Militaru and
other officers called out of retirement were part of the old order
and were incapable of reforming the army.
   Stanculescu, named defense minister after Militaru's resignation
Feb. 16, has promised to work with the military to remove Ceausescu
loyalists.
   The television said that military authorities would seek the
troops' suggestions on the new uniforms, then order them.
   It did not give a date or other details.
   In central Bucharest, meanwhile, about 50 people gathered around
the base of a 15-foot-high statue of Lenin, which a few
demonstrators covered with posters that said ``We're not robots,''
and ``Down with communism, down with its false symbols.''
   A few police watched but did not interfere as the demonstrators
denounced the government in heated conversations. There is
widespread suspicion that interim President Ion Iliescu and other
leading members of the caretaker government who were former ranking
Communists still hold Marxist beliefs, despite the general
consensus that communism is dead in Romania.
   One protester hurled a rock, which hit the statue's head with a
loud, hollow clang. ``It is empty,'' said an onlooker.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is in no hurry to
call a Cabinet vote on compromise proposals for starting
Israeli-Palestinian talks despite reported U.S. pressure for a
quick decision, an aide said Sunday.
   Israeli newspapers and state-run radio reported that U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is pressing for answers this
week on four key points holding up the peace process.
   But Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the prime minister has no
plans to bring any compromise proposals to a vote at a scheduled
meeting of the decision-making inner Cabinet on Wednesday.
   Asked about the pressure on Shamir, both from Baker and from
Shamir's coalition partners in the center-left Labor Party, Pazner
replied: ``He has overcome worse things.''
   He denied Israeli news reports that Shamir already has agreed to
a compromise on the makeup of the Palestinian delegation to an
initial meeting that Baker wants held in Cairo, Egypt.
   He said Shamir would not consider compromise suggestions before
a briefing by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who met Baker last week
in Washington. Arens returned Sunday and was meeting Shamir in Tel
Aviv.
   According to Israeli media reports, Baker is insisting that
Israel accept as Palestinian negotiators at least one resident from
Arab east Jerusalem and at least one who was deported by Israel
from the occupied territories.
   Including a deportee reportedly is intended to meet PLO demands
that outside Palestinians be represented, while at the same time
satisfying Israel's insistence that it will talk only to residents
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The issue of east Jerusalem is complicated because Israel
annexed the area into its capital after capturing it in the 1967
Middle East war. The PLO considers east Jerusalem the capital of
its desired Palestinian state.
   Another reported point of Baker's plan is that Egypt would
announce the Palestinian delegation; the PLO had demanded that it
make the announcement. But Israeli newspapers said Baker is asking
Israel to drop demands for iron-clad assurances that the PLO will
not be involved in the peace process at some later point.
   Egypt and the PLO have reportedly agreed to these conditions,
leaving the future of the peace contacts up to Israel.
   Two newspapers, Davar and Maariv, quoted an unidentified
official in Washington as saying Baker's demands ``weren't an
ultimatum, but not far from it.''
   Davar, aligned with the Labor Party, said that unless Israel
accepted Baker's four points, the United States may drop support
for Israel's plan for Palestinian elections.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Party stepped up pressure on Shamir Sunday
by refusing to approve two Cabinet appointees from the prime
minister's Likud bloc unless Shamir also agrees to return Science
Minister Ezer Weizman, a Labor member, to the inner Cabinet.
   Weizman was ousted in January over allegations that he had
illegal contacts with PLO officials, but Israeli judicial officials
have since said there is no evidence to prosecute him.
   Last week, Labor leaders threatened to quit the Likud-Labor
coalition unless the Cabinet accepts compromises to start peace
talks by March 7. Labor head Shimon Peres repeated the threat on
Sunday.
   In the occupied lands, meanwhile, Palestinians staged a general
strike to protest the alleged arson of a mosque last month in a
West Bank village. The strike was called by the Moslem
fundamentalist movement Hamas, or ``Zeal.''
   A 20-year-old Palestinian from the Gaza Strip town of Rafah,
Vahel Jamil El Hams, died at Israel's Tel Hashomer hospital after
being shot in the back by troops, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed the death and said it was checking the
circumstances.
   His death raised to 659 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians during the 26-month-old uprising in
the occupied lands. Some 189 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, and 43
Israelis have also been slain.

apologize after the tactic was denounced as racist and prejudicial
to a defendant.
   Gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Bill Nelson kicked off his campaign
Feb. 14 by promising to make a Florida case involving a black
defendant into his rival's ``Willie Horton _ only worse.'' On
Friday, he issued his apology.
   The six-term congressman is considered the front-runner among
the three Democrats seeking a chance to challenge first-term
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez. Martinez also has three Republican
challengers.
   Horton, who had spent 10 years in prison in Massachusetts for
murder, escaped during a furlough in 1987 and raped a Maryland
woman and assaulted her fiance. A commercial during President
Bush's 1988 campaign blamed Democrat Michael Dukakis for the
tragedy and was credited as a major factor in the Massachusetts
governor's defeat.
   The ad pictured Horton, a black man _ which critics said was a
tactic to stir racial fears. When Nelson likened a Florida police
slaying to the Horton case, the same charges arose.
   Nelson sought to blame Martinez for the case of Charles Street,
who is accused of killing two Dade County police officers in 1988,
10 days after he was released from prison early because of
overcrowding.
   The officers were killed after they went to subdue a man seen
throwing rocks. Police said the officers' killer took a revolver
away from one of them and fired at least seven shots, wounding them
in the head and shoulders, above their bulletproof vests.
   Street had just finished serving eight years of a 15-year
attempted-murder sentence for shooting a man outside a bar. He has
a 20-page criminal record that includes numerous charges of
assaulting police officers.
   At the time, corrections officials said Street served more time
than average for a 15-year sentence because of frequent infractions
in prison. But they also said he got out nearly two years earlier
than he otherwise would have because of an early-release program
proposed by Martinez in 1987 to help ease prison overcrowding.
   At a campaign kickoff held at the site of the slayings, Nelson
predicted Martinez ``is going to have his hide nailed to the wall''
on the Street case. Martinez declined to respond to the charge, but
others criticized Nelson's strategy.
   Former U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, the only black
candidate in the race, stopped short of calling his fellow Democrat
a racist but said he thought Nelson had hurt himself with black
voters.
   ``I hope it will cause people to realize that you're seeing
flapdoodle and stumblebum campaigns,'' said Hastings, who entered
the race just three days after he was impeached and removed from
the bench last year.
   ``I have no personal reason to believe he is a racist. It seems
to me he was doing a ploy to get attention,'' Hastings said.
   In an unusual move, Circuit Judge Alfonso C. Sepe, who is
presiding over Street's case, warned Nelson in a letter that making
Street a cause celebre in the 1990 governor's race could prejudice
the murder trial.
   ``My interest is in guaranteeing Mr. Street a fair trial,'' Sepe
wrote. ``We are hoping to avoid the kind of pretrial publicity that
would contaminate a jury required to try a presumably innocent
man.''
   Although Democrats howled loudly in 1988 that the Bush ad was
racist and unethical, Nelson was defended by national Democratic
Party chairman Ron Brown, who argued Democrats must learn to fight
fire with fire.
   ``On balance, anybody that takes an objective look at dirty
politics in this country, the Republicans are the champion,'' said
Brown.
   Brown's GOP counterpart, Lee Atwater, considered a pioneer in
modern negative campaigning, said he didn't know much about
Nelson's statements and didn't want to comment. He said he was
following the axiom ``Never interfere with your enemy while he is
in the process of destroying himself.''
   In his apology, Nelson said he would continue to question
Florida's early-release program. But he added: ``The linkage of
Charles Street to Willie Horton was a mistake, because of the
racial implications. That is a mistake for which I apologize.''
   ``In the heat of a campaign ... there are going to be mistakes
and missteps,'' Nelson said. ``This campaign has heated up very
early.''
   The gubernatorial primary will be held Sept. 4.

<HEAD>After Election Landslide, Sajudis to Seek Independence by Year's
End</HEAD>

   The leader of the Sajudis reform
movement said Sunday that independence for Lithuania could be
achieved this year after his group claimed a landslide victory in
the Soviet Union's first multiparty election.
   In balloting for the Baltic republic's 141-seat parliament
Saturday, voters appeared to have chosen the country's first
legislature not dominated by Communists.
   The main contenders were the Sajudis Popular Front, which has
led the drive for independence, and the reformed Lithuanian
Communist Party.
   On the street outside the Sajudis headquarters, passers-by
gathered excitedly around posters announcing the victory.
   Unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided,
Sajudis-endorsed candidates took 72 seats and non-Sajudis
candidates took 18, said Rita Dapkus, head of the Sajudis
information agency.
   ``If that is not a landslide, then what is?'' Algimantas
Cekuolis, a Sajudis officer, said at a news conference Sunday. ``It
is a very clear indication of what the people of Lithuania think.''
   Sajudis gathered the election results by calling local election
commissions, and the tallies were believed to be reliable. Official
results were not expected until Monday.
   Mrs. Dapkus said 45 races had no majority winner and will be
decided by runoff votes on March 10, while six were invalidated by
insufficient voter turnout or other factors. They will be decided
in April.
   Turnout among the 2.56 million eligible voters was about 75
percent, officials said.
   Vytautus Landsbergis, Sajudis chairman, said the results showed
Lithuanians trust his movement.
   ``We have a common and very clear goal. Our clear goal is
statehood and the independence of Lithuania,'' he said. ``This goal
is achievable this year.''
   The new Parliament's chief task will be navigating the Baltic
republic's difficult course to secession from the Soviet Union.
Sajudis wants talks with Moscow to prepare for an orderly
secession, which would break a 50-year-old tie that began with
Lithuania's occupation by the Red Army in 1940 and its annexation
later that year.
   The movement supports a neutral, sovereign Lithuania
characterized by a market economy and guarantees for human and
cultural rights.
   Although Sajudis dominated the voting, Landsbergis did not rule
out a strong role for the reformed Communists in a coalition
government selected by the new Parliament. He stressed the close
ties between Sajudis and reform-minded Communist Party members.
   ``Probably we will not ignore the party as an administrative
power and partner,'' said Landsbergis, who easily won election as a
parliament deputy from northern Lithuania.
   But, he said, the hard-line Communists, who oppose independence,
would probably not be welcome in the coalition.
   The participation by Sajudis and at least six other parties in
parliamentary elections was a first in the Soviet Union. In
December, Lithuania became the first of the 15 Soviet republics to
legalize non-Communist parties.
   The reform Communists won 22 seats, but 13 of those were in
districts where they were backed by Sajudis.
   Candidates from the Lithuanian chapter of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, which remains loyal to Moscow and opposes full
independence, won seven seats. Two non-party independents also won
seats without Sajudis backing.
   The Communist winners included the party's first secretary, and
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who in December defied
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and led his party to split with
moscow.
   Among the 72 Sajudis winners were 46 independents, 13 reform
Communists, nine Social Democrats, two Greens and two Christian
Democrats.
   Moldavians voted Sunday in their first free elections under
Soviet rule and expressed hopes their new Parliament would be able
to win greater sovereignty from Moscow.
   The main challenger to the Communists in Moldavia was the
Moldavian Popular Front, which likes to compare itself to Sajudis.
   The Red Army occupied Lithuania in June 1940 in accordance with
the secret terms of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, in which Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union divided central Europe between
themselves.
   Lithuania's old Parliament was coerced into voting to join the
Soviet Union the next month, and Lithuania was formally annexed by
the Soviets on Aug. 24, 1940.
   Lithuania had emerged as an independent state in 1918 with the
collapse of the Russian empire in World War I.

   Fire swept through a home early Sunday,

said.
   An 8-year-old boy and an adult suffered burns on the hands and
arms and were listed in fair condition at a hospital.
   A space heater was being used to ward off near-freezing
temperatures when the fire broke out at the wood-frame home, but
the cause of the blaze in this northeastern Florida town of 1,000

   Barry Joseph Carter, 30, was awakened by son Barry Jr.'s screams
and carried the 8-year-old to safety, but was driven back by heat

boy and another adult were hospitalized.
   The precise relationship between the victims was not known in
some cases, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, seeking to end four
years of fighting among black factions in Natal Province, appealed
to the warring groups Sunday to put down their weapons and fight
together for racial equality.
   Mandela, released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, still
supports the low-level armed struggle waged by his African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   But he said the black-on-black fighting in the southeastern
province hindered the battle against apartheid, South Africa's
policy of racial segregation.
   ``Even now as we stand together on the threshold of a new South
Africa, Natal is in flames,'' Mandela told an estimated 100,000
people who filled three adjacent soccer fields.
   ``My message to those of you involved in this battle of brother
against brother is this: take your guns, your knives and your
pangas and throw them into the sea,'' Mandela said. Pangas are
similar to machetes.
   Mandela and his wife, Winnie, arrived by helicopter to rousing
cheers. He spoke from a 4-story-tall platform draped with huge
flags of the ANC and its ally, the South African Communist Party.
   Many in the mostly black crowd waved the green, black and gold
banner of the African National Congress and chanted ``ANC! ANC!''
   About 3,000 blacks, mostly Zulus, have died since 1986 in the
power struggle in Natal. The main combatants are the ANC-aligned
United Democratic Front and Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu
political group headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi is a staunch oppenent of apartheid, but he differs
with the ANC over the best way to fight it.
   The ANC favors sanctions, boycotts, strikes and guerrilla
attacks to put pressure on the government. Buthelezi does not
endorse any of these actions and is a proponent of capitalism in
contrast to the socialist-oriented ANC.
   While the most intense battles have been in the townships around
Durban and Pietermaritzburg, 50 miles inland, the fighting has
spread throughout Natal.
   Several of Mandela's ANC colleagues, including Walter Sisulu,
have been in Natal since Thursday meeting with leaders of the
Front, Inkatha and local clergymen.
   Mandela made several conciliatory remarks concerning Inkatha and
Buthelezi, whom he praised for demanding the ANC be legalized and
political prisoners be released. President F.W. de Klerk on Feb. 2
legalized the ANC, which had been banned since 1960.
   Mandela also praised the Zulu leader for refusing to negotiate
with the white-led government while other black groups were
outlawed and their leaders imprisoned.
   ``This stand of Inkatha has contributed in no small measure to
making it difficult for the (white) regime to implement successive
schemes designed to perpetuate minority rule,'' Mandela said.
   Inkatha leaders took the unusual step of urging their supporters
to attend the rally to hear Mandela.
   Inkatha has long staged its own rallies, separate from those in
support of the Front and the ANC. On numerous occasions, violence
has broken out when the crowd from one rally headed home through
neighborhoods dominated by the other. About 3,000 marshals were on
hand to prevent violence at the rally, which lasted several hours.
   As Mandela spoke, police reported that the bodies of six black
youths were found at an abandoned church in Empangeni, 90 miles
north of Durban. Police said they were still investigating the
attack, which apparently took place Saturday.
   Later Sunday, Mandela spoke to tens of thousands of blacks in
the central city of Bloemfontein, where he called on de Klerk to
dismiss Defense Minister Magnus Malan and suspend Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Both men have come under heavy criticism following accusations
that the security forces have been involved in the killings of
dozens of anti-apartheid activists in the past decade.
   A judicial commission appointed by de Klerk is investigating the
charges.
   Mandela said the South African government had ``systematically
undermined'' the rule of law with such measures as the 3{-year-old
state of emergency.
   ``We note with appreciation that there are certain areas where
policemen are acting with restraint and fulfilling the role of
protecting all our people,'' Mandela said. ``But we view with
horror the moral decay within certain sections of the security
establishment.''

   Moldavians voted Sunday in their first
free elections under Soviet rule and expressed hopes their new
Parliament would be able to win greater sovereignty from Moscow.
   Many voters who gathered in parks after casting their ballots
seemed excited by the prospect of a new government and the ability
to choose candidates.
   ``We are learning democracy and we want to use the Parliament as
a peaceful way to gain our sovereignty,'' said Anatoly Zhdanov, who
said he was Moldavian by nationality despite his Russian name.
   Zhdanov, a 26-year-old employee in a brick factory, said he
voted for the Moldavian Popular Front, an independent political
movement that was the main challenger to the ruling Communist Party
in the contest for the 380 seats in the Moldavian Parliament.
   ``Of course we are going to win and then our demands will be
met,'' Klavdia Zhaloba said, smiling as she sold copies of Glasul,
an independent Moldavian newspaper.
   With more than 200 candidates on the ballot, the Popular Front
hoped to get at least 50 percent of the seats in Parliament. ``We
think part of the other deputies will come around to our side,''
said Yuri Roshka, a Popular Front leader and candidate.
   The Moldavian Popular Front likes to compare itself to Sajudis,
the Lithuanian reform group which on Sunday claimed victory in
parliamentary elections. It campaigned on a platform that favors
secession from the Soviet Union.
   ``We want to be an independent republic _ not with the Russians,
and not with the Romanians. And above all we want our
sovereignty,'' Anatoly Goncharov said as he listened to news of
election returns in Lithuania on his radio in a park.
   While Lithuania enjoyed two decades of independence between the
World Wars, Moldavia, a republic of 4 million people in the
southwest corner of the Soviet Union, has not known independence
this century.
   Until the czarist empire fell apart in 1917, Moldavia was the
Russian province of Bessarabia and after World War I it was ceded
to Romania, with which it shares a nearly identical language and
many historical and cultural heroes.
   Moldavia's common heritage with Romania was suppressed when
Stalin annexed it to the Soviet Union in 1940. But a half-century
of Soviet domination failed to diminish the desire of many of the
estimated 3 million ethnic Moldavians to reunite with their
neighbor.
   Demands for unity surged in Moldavia when Romania's December
revolution toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Sympathy for Romania is visible in the center of Kishinev, where
a Romanian flag is pasted on a statue of the Romanian King Stephan
the Great. Some residents wear Romanian flags pinned on their
lapels.
   But the Popular Front says reunification should be put on hold
for the moment in favor of rebuilding the republic's economy and
restoring Moldavian culture, stunted by decades of Russification.
   ``We want to unite with Romania, but it is not possible yet.
First, we have to create a democratic system here, and I think
reunification should happen when there is a declaration of the will
of the people,'' Roshka said.
   The Popular Front said it would press for the right to engage in
direct economic relations with other countries, a multiparty
political system, private property and a market economy.
   Those kind of changes will take time, especially if the Popular
Front is unable to muster the two-thirds' vote in Parliament that
is required to amend the constitution.
   Even a new government may be unable to solve all the problems
facing Moldavia.
   Representatives of other ethnic groups accuse the Popular Front
of whipping up ethnic sentiments that may make dialogue difficult
in the future.
   ``The Russian-speaking population is very frightened,'' said
Vladimir Solonar, a leader of the Unity movement formed to protect
the rights of Russians, Ukrainians and Jews, many of whose families
have lived in Moldavia for generations.
   The movement fielded candidates for each of the 65 districts in
Kishinev.
   Parliamentary elections were also held Sunday in the Central
Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, recently rocked by ethnic unrest in
which at least 22 people died.
   Reports from the capital of Dushanbe, monitored in London, said
voting was orderly. Official radio put the voter turnout at 64
percent and attributed the low turnout to the 6 p.m. curfew that
has been in effect since Feb. 12 to prevent more unrest.
   A parliamentary vote also took place Sunday in neighboring
Kirghizia, a mountainous republic on the border with China.
   The official Tass news agency said official results in both
elections were expected to be announced March 1.

   President Bush said Sunday he and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed in weekend talks that
a unified Germany would continue as ``a full member of NATO,''
including military participation in the Western alliance. Kohl said
``neutralism would be a very false solution.''
   After two days of discussions regarding delicate issues of a
unified Germany, Kohl said he recognizes ``the legitimate security
interests of all states'' in Europe, particularly Poland.
   ``Nobody needs to be afraid,'' the West German leader said. Bush
chimed in that if he were alarmed about the prospect of a single
Germany, he would not be endorsing reunification _ as he had
several times previously.
   There have been fears in Poland _ decimated by the Nazis in
World War II _ that a new Germany would seek to regain border
territory that was formerly under German rule.
   Nonetheless, Bush and Kohl both said they saw no need to add
Poland to the group of four nations that will dicuss reunification
with the two German states. Poland, like East Germany, has
abandoned its Communist monopoly government.
   Bush pointedly said that the United States regards the current
European borders, including Germany's long border with Poland, as
inviolable. And Kohl said the border question ``will be settled
definitely by a free elected all-German government.'' He said
``nobody has any intention of linking the question of national
unity with changes in existing borders.''
   East Germany is a member of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact,
and many in Europe have supported the concept of a neutral Germany
rather than one allied with the United States and its NATO allies.
East Germany is abandoning its communist government and the
Germanys are pursuing a common currency based on the West German
system.
   ``Neutralism would be a very false solution for us,'' said Kohl,
adding that he did not expect that the German people would support
a move away from NATO. He said the West Germans had proven their
reliability by accepting missiles during the 1980s.
   ``The security link between North American and Europe is ... for
a united Germany, of vital importance,'' said Kohl. He reiterated
his support for the continuing presence of U.S. military forces in
Germany.
   Kohl said he understands the delicacy of the German
reunification issue in several European countries, but said,
``nobody needs to be afraid'' of that.
   Kohl was asked whether Soviet troops _ long based in East
Germany _ might be welcomed to stay in a new Germany.
   ``A unified Germany cannot belong to two different security
systems,'' he said. He was asked if Germany might develop an
independent nuclear weapons system, and replied, ``We are not at
all longing to be an atomic power.''
   One other foreign policy issue surfaced _ the elections in
Nicaragua.
   Bush said ``whoever wins ... will find a better climate'' with
the United States, so long as the balloting was certified as free
and fair and the resulting government maintains a democratic system.
   The various questions of German reunification are at the center
of the dramatic political upheavals that have engulfed Europe over
the past year. Bush and Kohl talked about delicate issues that are
heightened by concerns involving German aggression in two world
wars.
   The allies which defeated Germany in World War II _ The United
States, Soviet Union, Great Britain and France _ have agreed to
convene meetings that are likely to lead to a unified Germany,
perhaps as soon as this year.
   Bush said the timetable was up to the Germans. He said he was
neither trying to ``speed it up'' or ``slow it down.''
   `If events are moving faster than we expected, it just means our
common goal'' of a unified Germany, will be achieved sooner than
expected, he said. Unification talks between East and West Germany
are to begin after East German elections March 18.
   Following two days of talks at Camp David, Bush and Kohl drove
down from the presidential retreat to meet with reporters at a
facility in Camp Greentop _ also in the Catoctin Mountain Park.
   Bush and Kohl took turns answering questions. Bush called their
talks ``extraordinarily frank.'' The two men alternated taking
questions on a stage in a camping recreation hall.
   Given sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc,
Bush was asked to describe the enemy which necessitates military
forces in Europe.
   ``The enemy is unpreditability,'' said Bush. ``The enemy is
instability. And it is for that reason that there are agreed
security provisions. Who out here was smart enough ... to predict
the changes that have taken place over the past year?''
   He added, ``What we want to do in a period of exciting change is
to have a stable western Europe. Eastern European countries are
throwing off the yoke of communism. The policy of NATO has
prevailed ... but nobody can predict for fact certain what will
come and so what we want to do is use our good offices and our
alignment with NATO to help with stability.''
   Bush acknowledged that ``some are saying we ought to take all
the troops out,'' commenting, ``in my judgment that would not
provide for a stable Europe ... The enemy is instability and
unpredictability as this rapid change continues to unfold inside
the Soviet Union and inside Eastern Europe.''
   Bush and Kohl said they discussed difficult issues engendered by
prospects of reunification of West and East Germany. One was
whether the new Germany would maintain its ties to NATO and another
involved border areas of Poland which were part of pre-war Germany.
   ``We do recognize the legitimate security interests of all
states,'' Kohl said in his opening statement, noting he was
speaking specifically of Poland.
   There have been concerns that a unified Germany would seek to
regain control of some border areas and Poland has asked to be
included in unification talks.
   Bush said the United States supports treaties which reaffirm the
current Poland-German borders but he agreed with Kohl that there
was no need to add Poland to the four-plus-two group that will meet
to discuss unification.
   The two Germanys are to begin unification talks after the March
18 elections in East Germany.Then they will discuss external
security issues with the four powers which defeated Nazi Germany in
World War II.
   Bush said, ``It's not for the United States to set a timetable.
It's not for us to say how fast'' unification would occur.
   Others have raised concerns about reunification, including Ariel
Sharon, Israel's former defense minister and a member of the
Israeli parliament. Asked on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' if he was
worried about reunification, he replied:
   ``Yes, of course. We, the Jews _ we that suffered six million
casualties dead by the Germans _ we must be aware of that. ... I
think the free world, including West Germany, should take all the
necessary steps that such unification will not harm anymore _ not
the free world and not the Jews,'' he said.
   Bush and Kohl were joined by close advisers, and the American
side said the two German states should begin soon to consult with
the four powers as they make progress in their reunification talks
in parallel consultations before the formal two-plus-four talks
begin.
   Both men said there was no need for an extra NATO summit, noting
upcoming economic and NATO meetings.

   A top Iranian official said in an
interview published Sunday that his country opposes hostage taking,
and another report said groups holding foreigners in Lebanon might
let them go without the need for diplomatic pressure.
   In an interview with the English-language Tehran Times, Iranian
Chief Justice and cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said: ``Iran
opposes taking hostages, terrorism, and air piracy because these
are contrary to Islamic and humanitarian principles.''
   In the interview, sent to The Associated Press by telefax, Yazdi
also said Iran recognizes international law and staunchly opposes
any interference in the international affairs of other nations.
   Yazdi's statements came amid other indications that the Iranian
government is distancing itself from pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon
that are believed to hold the 18 Westerners.
   They include eight Americans, four Britons, an Italian, an
Irishman, two West Germans and two Swiss. The longest held is
42-year-old Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associted Press when kidnapped in March 1985.
   The Persian daily Ettela'at, which has the second-largest
circulation in Iran, said in an editorial Sunday that the groups
holding the foreigners might free them.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the paper as
saying: ``The Lebanese Moslem people who have been holding the
Western hostages since their captivity may choose to free them at
their discretion without the need for diplomatic give and take.''
   The paper claimed that Americans and other Westerners do not
really want to see the hostages freed because they have become a
means of trying to discredit Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution,
according to the news agency account monitored in Nicosia.
   The Ettela'at editorial echoed a similar statement in the Tehran
Times on Thursday that said the hostages should be released without
preconditions on Islamic and humanitarian grounds. It was the first
such known statement by an Iranian newspaper.
   On Friday, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon's most
influential Shiite Moslem cleric, said the hostages were being used
by the West to distort the image of Islam and a means should be
found to free them.
   While many Iranian officials have said in the past that the
Islamic Republic opposed hostage taking, Iran had set preconditions
for using its influence to try to get the hostages freed.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani said last year that the United
States should release Iranian assets frozen since the revolution if
it wanted Tehran's help with the hostages.
   Their freedom is believed linked to factional fighting within
the Iranian government. There were signs this week that the power
struggle is deepening between the pragmatists seeking a more open
Iran and the radicals, who believe that contacts with the West will
dilute the Islamic revolution.
   The main Iranian oppostion group, The Mujahedeen Khalq, has said
in statements from its Baghdad headquarters this week that
anti-government riots have broken out in a number of Iranian cities.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed, although the
official news agency reported 30 arrests at a demonstration after
cancellation of a soccer match.

<TEXT>
   East German Premier Hans Modrow agreed Sunday
to lead his party in March 18 elections, giving the embattled
Communists a last chance at political survival.
   According to recent opinion polls, Modrow remains the most
popular politician in East Germany, despitehis affiliation with a
party that has been disgraced and stripped of most of its former
authority.
   The leftist Social Democratic Party is expected to poll a
majority of votes in East Germany's first-ever free elections,
followed by the more conservative Christian Democrats.
   But Modrow's decision to stay with his party could boost the
Communists' chances of retaining at least a minor role in the next
leadership.
   Modrow told the 530 delegates at an East Berlin convention of
his Party for Democratic Socialism that he would lead it in the
March vote although it ``wasn't easy'' to make up his mind, the
official ADN news agency said.
   The 62-year-old politician had been waffling over the leadership
issue for several days. He is apparently reluctant to become a
scapegoat for four decades of Communist economic mismanagement,
which the Bonn government claims has brought East Germany to the
brink of ruin.
   But Modrow, a member of the ruling Politburo from 1958 until the
Communist Party disbanded that body and changed its name last
December, enjoys widespread support as a reformer and is the
party's most likely vote-getter.
   ``For all the things I tried to do for a policy of reform in
1989 and maybe even earlier, I now know very well that it wasn't
enough,'' ADN quoted Modrow as saying.
   All leading East German parties have ruled out building
coalition governments with the Communists.
   Ibrahim Boehme, leader of the Social Democrats, said Modrow was
``a good candidate, but unfortunately for the wrong party.''
   Modrow has been premier since November, when a new Cabinet was
seated following the ouster of hard-line Erich Honecker and his top
lieutenants, most of whom are now under investigation for alleged
corruption and misuse of office.
   Polls have predicted Boehme's party will emerge with the biggest
bloc of votes in the elections, but it is unclear whether the
Social Democrats will be able to build a government on their own.
   West German officials have speculated the vote may be so divided
the new 400-member parliament could abandon efforts to build a
Cabinet and instead vote for immediate merger with West Germany.
   If a new government is formed, it is expected to open talks with
Bonn immediately on how to bail out the economy.
   Meanwhile, ADN reported the East German chief prosecutor's
office was investigating Honecker for allegedly directing $45.5
million in government funds to a hard currency bank account to
which only he had access.
   The currency was allegedly money that West Germany paid for the
release of East German political prisoners, ADN said.
   Also on Sunday, West Germany's Der Spiegel magazine reported
Honecker claimed he was personally responsible for preventing a
bloody crackdown on demonstrators in the early stages of East
Germany's peaceful revolution.
   Honecker said in a letter to prosecutors that he ordered police
and soldiers in the city of Leipzig not to fire during a
demonstration Oct. 9, according to Der Spiegel.
   Der Spiegel distributed its report to Western news agencies in
advance of its arrival on newsstands Monday.

<TEXT>
   Eduardo Guerrero rose just before
midnight, saddled and mounted his dappled gray horse and rode four
hours through the dark hills before dawn Sunday to vote for the
first time in his life.
   The 24-year-old peasant-rancher stood in line with about 2,000
other campesinos anxious to have their say about 10{ years of
revolutionary leftist Sandinista government.
   Jose Mejia, president of the polling station, said he expected
well over 90 percent of the 2,300 voters registered in Los Chinamos
to cast ballots.
   The hamlet of thatch-roofed, bamboo-sided houses along a rocky
road lined with banana trees is in the heart of the opposition
stronghold of Chontales province.
   Nearly all the men wore straw cowboy hats, jeans and Texas-style
boots, many with spurs. More than 100 horses were tethered along a
fence behind the wooden, tin-roofed polling station resembling an
ample shed.
   All of those consulted were adamantly anti-Sandinista. Several
said the incumbents would be lucky to get a few votes in Los
Chinamos, perhaps from some, but not all, of the score of unarmed
soldiers in camouflage uniforms interspersed in groups of four or
five among the peasants.
   Pregnant women, those with infants in tow and the elderly and
infirm were given priority when the polling station opened at 7 a.m.
   Guerrero had arrived just after 4 a.m. when there were already
about 200 people lined up to vote.
   ``It's well worth it to lose a day. We don't like the
Sandinistas much around here,'' he said.
   Many of those interviewed expressed open admiration and support
for the U.S.-supported Contra rebels camped in the hills around Los
Chinamos and throughout northern Chontales.
   The rebels had clashed Saturday with Sandinista soldiers
stationed down the road. A Sandinista officer said one soldier was
killed and another wounded.
   He said security for the voting was increased after intelligence
reports showed the Contras planned to put in an appearance in
Chinamos during the voting.
   Judging from the comments of those standing in line, the
counterrevolutionaries most likely would have been cheered.
   ``When the Sandinistas won the war against Somoza, just about
everyone in Nicaragua was Sandinista,'' said Jose Alvarez Perez,
26. ``But we've been negatively affected by them.''
   The men complained bitterly of what they said was harsh
repression of relatives and neighbors suspected of collaboration
with the rebels.
   Prospero Alvarez said he was jailed three times in recent years
for a total of four months. ``They put us in jail for nothing,'' he
said.
   It was unclear if his open sympathy for the rebels pre-dated his
incarceration or was a byproduct of it.
   Humberto Salazar, 52, said his son Antonio was killed by
Sandinista forces last year as he returned home from a corn patch.
``They just opened fire. Didn't even yell out to him,'' he said.
   ``We don't believe in the promises of Daniel Ortega,'' Alvarez
said of the regime's campaign vow that ``everything will be
better.''
   The government contends that once its re-election is certified
as free and fair, Washington will have no choice but to end support
for the Contras. Ortega says a definite end to the war will result
in progress towards prosperity.
   But those around Los Chinamos doubt the war will end as long as
the Sandinistas remain in power.
   ``The Contra is fighting against a system that does not allow
him to live,'' said another peasant rancher, who asked not to be
identified. ``As long as the Sandinista regime continues, the war
continues. When they leave, the war will end.''
   ``Those of us who have suffered the war personally do not
believe it will end,'' said a 32-year-old woman, who also declined
to provide her name.
   ``My husband has been fighting (for the Contras) for six years.
The Sandinistas had taken him away once and he wasn't going to wait
for them to take him again. I'm left with seven children to take
care of,'' she added.

<HEAD>Cisneros Endorses Richards, Down Plays Alleged Slur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN HIGHTOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros has
endorsed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards despite
allegations that she used the term ``wetbacks'' in a 1976 campaign
speech.
   Cisneros said he had been unaware of the controversy until
Saturday, when he went ahead with scheduled endorsement anyway.
   The Hispanic-oriented newspaper Tiempo ran an article Feb. 22
alleging that Ms. Richards referred to illegal aliens as
``wetbacks'' while running for Travis County commissioner.
   She responded by accusing Jim Mattox, a rival for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, of planting the story as part of a smear
campaign. The Mattox campaign said Ms. Richards is just trying to
shift the blame.
   But Cisneros praised Ms. Richards for her longtime support of
Hispanics and called the allegation of a racial slur ``the last
gasps of a campaign that has nothing else to talk about.''
   ``Not anyone who is a serious student of Ann's record can take
it seriously,'' said Cisneros, one of the country's best known
Hispanics in politics. ``It just isn't in character, and I think
it's inconsequential in the final analysis.''
   Ernesto Fraga, publisher of Waco-based Tiempo, produced
handwritten copies of a speech Ms. Richards made to a labor group
during her successful 1976 campaign for county commissioner. He
said the Mattox campaign had nothing to do with the article.
   A sentence in the speech text Fraga quoted said: ``If it takes a
man to hire non-union labor, cross picket lines and work wetbacks
then I say thank god for a woman or anyone else who is willing to
take over.''
   Ms. Richards originally said the part of the speech that uses
the term wasn't in her handwriting. She later said she may have
written ``wetbacks,'' but maintained she didn't say it.
   Ms. Richards stressed the minority hiring and promotion record
of the state treasury, which she heads, saying it is the best of
any state agency. She also promised that Hispanics would play a key
role in her administration if she were elected.

   To hear some people tell it, there
is money to burn in this trendy seaside community, but it still
isn't every day that a bank tosses $42,500 into the trash.
   ``We're sort of embarrassed,'' Great American Bank spokesman
Brian Luscomb said Friday, a day after the windfall was recovered
from a municipal trash truck that had hauled it away.
   ``It was an accident and we're really not commenting much beyond
that,'' said Luscomb, who added that a bank employee whose name
wasn't released put the money in the wrong container.
   When the garbage truck got to the dump, officials there had been
warned about the missing cash, and they had the driver take his
load to a city yard instead. The garbage was dumped there and
municipal employees dug through the trash until they found the cash.
   The city's trash collectors must try to track down the owners of
expensive items but can keep lesser ones, said General Services
Director David Niederhaus.

   Just call Amtrak No. 581 the little train
that could if you gave it long enough.
   A San Diego-Los Angeles commuter run that normally takes two
hours and 45 minutes took more than twice that Friday. The first
locomotive broke down, the second was sluggish, the crew walked off
the job and the replacement crew members couldn't get their van to
start.
   ``It seems that everything that could have gone wrong did,''
said Renee Banks, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington. ``This
certainly is an unfortunate incident. It really doesn't happen that
often.''
   First, the locomotive's air compressor failed, stalling the
train's engines and leaving the roughly 500 passengers without air
conditioning on a day when temperatures reached the high 70s.
   The train sat on the tracks south of Oceanside for almost 90
minutes until an engine borrowed from Santa Fe Railway was hitched
to the cars. But the replacement engine, designed to haul freight
trains, was far slower, and progress was painstaking.
   Then, with the train just 11 miles from its destination, the
Amtrak crew stopped work _ and with it the train _ citing a federal
law that doesn't allow railway crews to work past the end of their
shifts.
   The train sat for yet another hour as a replacement crew
struggled with a van that wouldn't start. The crew members finally
borrowed an Amtrak superintendent's car and drove to the train.
   Eventually, No. 581 did arrive in Los Angeles, about six hours
after it left San Diego _ enough time to make a round-trip journey
between the two cities.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with
mortars and machine guns in east Beirut Sunday, blocking efforts to
reopen a key road junction linking their districts.
   A police spokesman said the three-hour battle began when a
mediation committee tried to remove mines and barricades blocking a
traffic circle linking a district controlled by Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia with territory dominated by Gen. Michel
Aoun's troops.
   The intersection links the militia-controlled pockets of Nabaa
and Ashrafiyeh with the army-held neighborhood of Sin el-Fil and
Horsh Tabet.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the clash intensified into an exchange of mortar
rounds between the warring factions across the whole of east Beirut.
   Geagea's militia blamed the escalation on Aoun's troops, saying
they opened fire at soldiers preparing to remove mines from the
sand barricades.
   ``Aoun wants to block efforts aimed at stabilizing the
cease-fire,'' a communique said.
   Aoun's command countered that the militiamen were ``cheating the
population by claiming they want to reopen roads.''
   Police said the exchange started several fires in the
miltia-held district of Ashrafiyeh and the army-controlled district
of Furn el-Shubbak before the fighting subsided into an
intermittent exchange of sniper fire at dusk.
   The rival forces also clashed across roads reopened earlier in
the day for the first time in three weeks. The police spokesman
said two mortar rounds crashed into a Moslem district of west
Beirut early in the evening, but no casualties were reported.
   The two sides fought despite separate efforts by a Christian
mediation committee and a Palestinian delegation to end the
bloodletting.
   Despite a cease-fire that went into effect on Feb. 17, there was
little sign of an end to the 26-day battle for control of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Geagea's headquarters reported one of their fighters was killed
by sniper fire and Aoun's command said two soldiers were wounded.
   By police count, at least 691 people have been killed and 1,915
wounded in the fighting that began Jan. 30, the worst between
Christian rivals since the civil war between Moslems and Christians
broke out in April 1975.
   Parts of the city have been left in ruins and Aoun's troops have
corralled thousands of Geagea's militiamen in several districts of
east Beirut in the power struggle.
   The roads crossing the confrontation lines were reopened after
several days of negotiating between the rival forces by a mediation
committee of three independent Christian leaders.
   Some of the roads had been mined and others remain so, posing
dangers to civilians fleeing to safer areas or trying to repair
their shattered homes.
   A committee statement said the mediators will continue their
efforts ``until all roads are reopened and the combatants
disengaged.''
   Geagea, whose forces control the Christian sector's ports and
two-thirds of the enclave, has indicated he is prepared to
negotiate.
   But Aoun, who started the fighting by moving against Geagea,
showed no sign of seeking a negotiated settlement.
   ``I'm convinced that the committee will not be able to achieve
any result because Geagea's declared stands contradict his
statements,'' he was quoted as saying by the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper.
   Geagea has rejected Aoun's demand that the militia's 6,000
hardcore fighters, who have been backed by thousands of reservists,
be disbanded and absorbed into his 19,000-strong army and the
Lebanese Forces transformed into a purely political organization.
   The Christian warlord instead proposes a joint command for his
militia and Aoun's troops.
   President Elias Hrawi, elected by Parliament in November with a
mandate to carry out a Lebanese peace plan, has dismissed Aoun as
military commander. However, Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's
authority.
   Aoun also opposes a Syrian-backed peace plan, saying it should
call for a complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The 40,000 Syrian soldiers came under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says they are really acting as a
Moslem ally in the country's civil war.

   Voting in the Nicaraguan countryside
was largely peaceful Sunday, but authorities said at least seven
polling places didn't open because of Contra guerrilla activity.
   ``The electoral process in the main is going normally, although
there is some counterrevolutionary activity,'' said Interior
Minister Tomas Borge.
   Four polling places did not open near Santa Rosa del Penon,
about 50 miles north of Managua. Two in the central province of
Matagalpa did not open, nor did one in the Atlantic Coast province
of Zelaya, Borge said. There are 4,394 polling places nationwide.
   All three areas are known for heavy Contra rebel activity, and
all are strongholds of opposition to the leftist Sandinista
government.
   The most serious incident took place Saturday night near the
town of La Cruz del Rio Grande, about 65 miles north of the
Atlantic Coast town of Bluefields, when two Sandinista party
activists were kidnapped, authorities said.
   ``When we heard about the kidnappings we got together and
decided the safest thing to do would be to close the precinct,''
said Dr. Cirilo Omier, president of the regional vote collection
center in Bluefields, in a telephone interview.
   He said representatives of the Sandinista party and the United
National Opposition coalition agreed to the closures, as did the
Indian organization Yatama, which supports UNO's presidential
candidate but is running its own races locally, and the small
Central American Unionist Party.
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking re-election to a six -year
term, said Saturday night that Contra activity had been reported
north of Santa Rosa in the province of Leon.
   Contra fighters also reportedly were seen along major roads in
the central province of Chontales, also a Contra and opposition
stronghold.
   However, two Associated Press reporters in Chontales saw the
voting to be quiet and peaceful throughout the region.
   More than 800 people were waiting in line in the morning at two
voting stations in La Gateada, a hamlet about 120 miles east of
Managua.
   Three hundred unarmed soldiers lined up in the nearby hamlet of
Muha, near a military base established to fight the Contras.
   In nearby Villa Sandino, dozens of peasants came down from their
remote mountain homes on horses and mules to vote at five stations
in town, where about 900 people were in line as of mid-morning.
   An army spokesman said security had been beefed up in the area
because squads of Contras had been seen, but no incidents were
reported.
   Voting was also smooth in Jalapa, 130 miles to the north of
Managua near the Honduran border.
   Troops patrolled the area, only 20 miles from Contra base camps
at Yamales in Honduras, but no incidents were reported.
   ``Monday we're going to have chicken soup,'' with opposition
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as the chicken, said Marvin
Idiarquerz, a 22-year-old Sandinista supporter in Jalapa.

   Eight-year-old Erik Hundley of South Nyack,
N.Y., rattles off the civil rights struggles of Martin Luther King
Jr. after a week of study but admits, ``I forgot who Harriet Tubman
was.''
   Sameena Parveen, 13, an eighth grader at Kettering Middle School
in Largo, Md., is intrigued with the underground railroad movement
and the role of a virtual unknown, John Henry, who mapped the
secret routes.
   And, 12-year-old LaKeisha Lewis of Spencer, Okla., becomes
``sort of angry'' when she thinks about ``how the civil rights
thing came about ... because I don't think people should be treated
like that.''
   The study of black American heroes and heroines went into high
gear in schools this month, as it does every February, in
recognition of Black History Month. Although started in 1926 by
Carter G. Woodson in recognition of the birthdays of Abraham
Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, celebration of the special month
gained momentum when King's birthday became a national holiday.
   Now, King's January birthday is used as the springboard into
February's recognition of other black leaders during special school
assemblies, field trips, classroom projects, book reports, skits
and plays.
   ``It's good there's a month to remember the accomplishments of
the blacks,'' said Sameena, a native of India. ``Some students
don't seem to care, and some people do change their attitudes
(toward other races). I think most of the students only act like
they really care and then quickly forget.''
   Bernadine Lyles of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
nation's second largest after New York, said many of the 646
schools start with the King holiday to go into their program on
black Americans.
   ``That holiday has created much more awareness,'' said Ms.
Lyles, instructional adviser of the elementary level for the
multicultural unit of the Office of Instruction. ``Most students
have some idea of the Civil Rights movement and its effect on
African American history and culture.''
   San Francisco schools spokeswoman Madelaine Eaton said all
64,000 students participate in a Martin Luther King essay contest
as part of Black History Month. The district, which is 20 percent
black, also offers students and teachers an array of black American
art and language resources but each school is left to develop its
own particular programs.
   In some other states, the teaching of black history is
determined mainly by the size of the black student body and by the
interests of the teachers.
   At Community High School in Carbondale, Ill., English teacher
Anna Jackson said there are no special assemblies for either King's
birthday or Black History Month.
   ``I really try to integrate black history throughout the year''
by incorporating the works of blacks and other minorities in the
classroom assignments, said Ms. Jackson, one of six minority
teachers. About 30 percent of the 1,000 students at the school are
black or Asian.
   To her dismay, though, the school usually gives semester exams
during the days leading up to King's birthday ``so the kids are
focusing on preparing for the exam.''
   At the private all-girl La Reine High School in the Washington,
D.C., suburb of Suitland, Md., Sister Kateri said it is a
frustrating struggle to keep up with the changing needs of the 475
young women. The student body was 12 percent black in 1973 and is
now 63 percent black. Three of the 42 faculty members are black.
   ``I would say that (the study of black history) has come slowly
but we have tried to integrate it as much as possible,'' said
Sister Kateri. ``I think it all depends how strong a teacher might
be inclined toward spending the individual time, although there has
been a definite push for this.''
   For others, the King holiday underscores the need to include
other cultures in school curriculum and textbooks.
   Clayborne Carson, a former civil rights activist who is editor
of King's papers _ a 15-year project that is expected to result in
publication of 12 volumes of King's writings and speeches _ said
that in many schools the black history focus is merely token.
   ``It's like we created the occasion before we knew what we were
going to do with it,'' said Carson, who is at American University
this semester as a Visiting Landmarks Scholar in American History.
``It's going to be a long process moving from tokenism to
meaningful content. We've just begun that process.''
   Nannette McGee, consultant for social studies education in the
Georgia Department of Education, said that although textbooks have
been written about blacks in America, ``It just seems that ... they
became old and out of date and they were not used because of that.''
   Social studies textbooks have not been updated in five years,
she said.
   Murdell McFarlin of the Atlanta Public Schools agreed.
   ``School officials aren't replacing the books right now because
it's not the state-scheduled time, but they are supplementing them
with essays and other information,'' said Mrs. McFarlin.
   Iowa in 1976 became the first state to pass a law mandating that
school curriculum incorporate contributions of minorities and women.
   In New York, state Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol recently
announced plans to draft broad revisions in the state's public
school curriculum to give greater recognition to the contributions
of non-white cultures to American society. The changes would affect
the state's 2.5 million public schoolchildren.
   Ellen Swartz, multicultural project coordinator in the
Rochester, N.Y., school district, said the district has been
working for three years designing and producing classroom materials
about groups that are usually misrepresented or omitted in
textbooks and other educational materials. While most of the
material developed is used voluntarily by the teachers, she said
officials now are working on a ninth grade textbook on Africans.
   ``Rochester has taken a step past many districts that I've seen.
Not in intent but in actions,'' said Ms. Swartz. ``What we are
doing that's different is committing the resources and dollars. We
are solidly on the cutting edge of movement in this area.''
   Jack Gaffney, social studies program coordinator for the San
Diego Unified School District, said the district tries to
incorporate ``a strong multicultural strand'' into the curriculum
``all the way down through kindergarten.''
   ``It's a matter of infusing things, where they would normally
occur in history, in the curriculum to increase the depths of
cultural studies,'' said Gaffney.
   Marlowe Teig, who for 22 years worked with a number of textbook
publishers, said many schools are unable to puchase up-to-date
textbooks that reflect black history. School and community
officials also are not clear about what they want in the textbooks
and fail to list the criteria, he added.
   Developing textbooks that reflect the role of blacks and others
in American society is more than ``just mentioning all the
leaders'' or ``taking a paragraph out and plugging another one
in,'' he said.
   ``You have to be more reflective. Textbooks are not like USA
Today. They don't line the garbage cans tomorrow. They are going to
be around for years. They affect children's lives.''

   The ruling Socialist Party and leading
opposition groups have gained enough popular support under election
laws to field national slates of candidates in the first general
multiparty elections in more than 40 years, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   They are among 12 parties that will run candidates in the
elections, set for March 25, according to the newspaper Mai Nap.
There are more than 50 political parties.
   Candidates had to collect at least 750 signatures of eligible
voters in their district to run.
   There are 176 individual districts, 152 regional districts and
58 seats on a national level.
   In most cases, if a party succeeds in fielding a candidate in 25
percent of the electoral districts of a given county or the capital
city, then it could put up a county list. If it had a minimum of
seven county lists, then it could put up a national list.
   A week before the Hungarian elections, East Germans will vote in
the first free national balloting in the Soviet bloc.
   Among the Hungarian parties that will contest the elections
nationally are the ruling Socialist Party, which was created from
the former Communist party, and a newly constituted Communist Party.
   Non-leftist parties in the national running include the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, the League of Free Democrats, and the
Independent Smallholders.

   Gov. Jim Martin has decided against seeking
any elective office once his term ends in 1992, saying he wanted to
preclude criticism that he was positioning himself for future
campaigns.
   In a letter to The News &amp; Observer published Sunday, Martin said
he was embittered by what he viewed as unfair, partisan attacks by
Democrats.
   ``Convinced that I can more effectively lead and work for a
stronger North Carolina if my motives cannot be misrepresented, I
am happy to sacrifice any further Martin candidacy,'' he said.
   The Republican governor also vigorously challenged news reports
that criticized his performance at a Thursday news conference, in
which he defended his Research Office against allegations that it
engaged in tax-funded campaign activities.
   During that appearance, he at times appeared incoherent,
uncharacteristically used profanity and disregarded the entreaties
of aides who wanted him to stop talking.
   His staff attributed Martin's performance in part to medication
he had taken for a throat infection. But in his letter to the
newspaper, Martin said he had not taken medication before the news
conference but that he was in ``agony'' from the illness.
   The governor said Saturday that although he was fighting the
effects of a severe throat and sinus infection, he was in control.
He said he would hold the news conference again under the same
circumstances.
   Martin called the appearance the best day of his political
career.
   ``It was my best, because I stood up on wobbly legs and
suppressed my illness long enough to identify the Democrat
investigators and newspaper who tried to destroy me before I ran
again,'' he said.
   Martin lashed out at what he said was unfair treatment by
Attorney General Lacy Thornburg and to a lesser extent by State
Auditor Ed Renfrow, both Democrats.
   He said he was angry over reports that Thornburg was considering
whether to investigate the governor's Research Office for possible
political misuse of state property. Thornburg said Friday that his
office would not investigate.
   Martin said it appeared that he was rambling during the news
conference because he had been handed a note by an aide saying
Thornburg had accepted his invitation for a confrontation at the
news conference and was on his way.
   He said he didn't want to leave before Thornburg got there and
be accused of a ``cowardly retreat.''
   ``As weak as I was, I was going to stand my ground with him,''
Martin said. ``I had come to despise him. I was going to make him
put the handcuffs on me right there in front of the reporters if
that's what he wanted to do.''
   But John Simmons, a spokesman for Thornburg, said Sunday that
the attorney general never sent word that he would attend the news
conference.
   Martin said he had decided against challenging U.S. Sen. Terry
Sanford some time ago because he and his wife, Dorothy, had no
desire to return to Washington, where he served 12 years in the
House of Representatives.
   But he had planned to defer the announcement until after the
1990 elections to keep from becoming a lame duck and losing some of
his political influence.
   By renouncing future political ambitions, Martin said he could
work to solve the state's problems without having every move
interpreted in the light of a possible Senate bid.
   ``After the way you piled on when I was down,'' he wrote in the
letter to Claude Sitton, editor of The News &amp; Observer, ``I know
for certain that the only worthwhile ambition left for me is to
root you and Lacy Thornburg out of North Carolina politics, along
with any Democrats who take delight in your mischief.''

   Voting was calm and orderly Sunday in
this remote northern border outpost despite the presence of
U.S.-supported Contra rebel bases only 20 miles away.
   ``This will mean political pluralism and everyone's
participation,'' said Jose Burkhardo, 22, a supporter of te ruling
Sandinista leftists, displaying his ink-stained left thumb with
glee to prove he had voted. ``We want peace and a chance to rebuild
the economy.''
   There are about 14,400 voters in the Jalapa valley, which has 15
precincts in town and 21 in the outskirts. The valley, a productive
agricultural area, is bordered on three sides by Honduras.
   Contra fighters have attacked the area in past years and there
were frequent border incidents with Honduran troops, but the
activity has died downsince the United States cut off lethal aid to
the Contras in March of 1988.
   Contra leaders said they have ordered their troops to defend
themselves but not to interfere with the voting.
   Lt. Antonio Diaz, an officer at the local military garrison
where 3,500 soldiers are quartered, reported everything quiet on
Sunday. He said the soldiers kept up routine patrols during the
weeks leading up to the vote and there were no incidents.
   Observers from the Organization of American States were on hand
to monitor the voting together with 30 Coloradans from the
Boulder-Jalapa Friendship City Project Inc. of Boulder, Colo.
   ``I am very impressed. People are being businesslike,'' said
Charlotte Houston, a Boulder County clerk who spent the day poll
watching. ``They also enjoy seeing their neighbors at the polls
like we do.''
   Before voting began, election officials, representatives of the
political parties and voters in line sang the national anthem.
Bystanders were shown empty ballot boxes before voting commenced.
   ``The Sandinistas say everything will be better,'' United
National Opposition supporter Maximiliano Sandoval said. ``For
whom? We have had them for 10 years and what have we got? I am sure
UNO will win.''
   Antonio Huerta Vallejos, a local school teacher, did not agree.
   ``My school was built by the Sandinistas, so was the health
center,'' he told a visiting reporter. ``It is important we vote
for the (Sandinistas).
   ``Everything is in order and things are quiet. It is very clear
it is a secret vote,'' he added.

Theft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Loretta Born's purse was stolen, she
lost more than money and ID cards. She lost a little magnet that's
an important part of an experimental pain-control device.
   Born was forced to improvise Saturday night when her purse
suddenly was missing after a stranger came to the door, ostensibly
to ask for directions. But with the help of a neighbor's magnet and
telephoned instructions from her doctor, Born was able to control
the device implanted within her body.
   A nerve stimulator and the generator that powers it were
surgically implanted in Born as part of an experimental treatment
for pain that resulted from spinal injuries that she suffered in a
car accident.
   Born's doctor, Robert Weiner, said fewer than 40 people in the
country are using the device.
   Born said she would touch the magnet to the skin of her abdomen
in order to turn off the power to the generator under her skin. If
the stimulator runs too long, she said, ``it's painful and it
causes my legs to jerk and makes it impossible for me to lie down.''
   When the purse and magnet disappeared, Born contacted sheriff's
Deputy Philip Escude, who called local hospitals and then contacted
Weiner in Dallas.
   ``He told us that she would have to be brought back to Dallas
unless somebody could find a magnet to turn her off,'' Escude said.
   Born said her husband borrowed a magnet from a neighbor.
   The magnet was larger and more powerful than the one she usually
uses, so Weiner ``told me not to put it against my skin. First, we
started out about six inches away, then four, then two inches. It
finally cut off when we put the magnet about two inches away.''
   Without the stimulator working right, Born said she is in pain.
She said she was scared she might damage the equipment if she used
the neighbor's magnet again, but she would have to wait until
Monday to get another magnet from her doctor or hope the young
woman who stole her purse returns her own magnet.

   For a while, it seemed like the old Soviet Union
of the days before Mikhail Gorbachev and glasnost.
   ``We heard about tanks, about police waiting with gas and
shovels,'' said one fearful middle-aged woman at a pro-democracy
protest in the capital during nationwide demonstrations Sunday.
   Carrying a sign saying, ``We don't need a palace coup, we need
direct elections,'' the woman was one of tens of thousands who
marched past sand-filled dump trucks barricading all approaches to
the Kremlin. About 17,000 police lay in wait with truncheons and
water cannon.
   Protesters were clearly intimidated by authorities' warnings of
the possibility of violence, promises of harsh penalties for
extremists and reports that hospitals were prepared for many
casualties.
   It didn't happen.
   The rally at the north end of the Garden Ring Road in Moscow
started small and tentatively, with sidelong glances at rows of
giant snowplows blocking exits from the parade route.
   However, one leader repeatedly promised police through a
bullhorn, ``We represent no danger.'' Other protesters struck up
conversations with individual officers to defuse tension.
   Gradually, it became clear that the army of police and Interior
Ministry troops were not preparing to charge the protesters.
   Throngs of Muscovites joined the protest, which eventually
included about 100,000 people. Red, blue and white flags of tsarist
Russia fluttered in the occasional drizzle along with red and black
flags of anarchists and the sky-blue cross on a white background of
the Memorial Society, which is dedicated to remembering the victims
of dictator Josef Stalin.
   Even the knots of police finally relaxed, stashing their riot
gear.
   ``General, are you with the people?'' shouted a woman in the
crowd to a stocky Interior Ministry officer directing crowd control
at Gorky Park, one of the gathering points for the march.
   ``Sure, I am!'' replied Maj. Gen. Georgy Postoyuk. Contrary to
widespread rumors that authorities planned to provoke violence to
justify a crackdown, he said officials worked closely with rally
organizers and the result was ``a very good, orderly meeting.''
   The crowd count was much lower than organizers had predicted
before the barrage of warnings. They included a television appeal
by Minister of Culture Nikolai Gubenko, a popular actor, for
cancellation of the demonstrations.
   Several planned counterdemonstrations of conservative and
nationalist groups elsewhere in the city never materialized.
   Authorities even went so far as to broadcast a Polish film
called ``The Sex Mission'' _ with nudity rare on Soviet television
_ on Sunday morning. Protesting student Ivan Chemburov said he
thought it was a deliberate attempt to entice people to stay home
from the demonstration.
   Rally banners demanded multiparty elections and land for anyone
who wants to work it. Some speakers drew loud applause as they
called for the resignation of the entire Council of Ministers and
the Communist Party Politburo.
   ``Communism is a cancerous tumor,'' said one poster. ``Party
mafia _ resign! We've had enough of Marxist-Leninism. We want to
live like people,'' read another.
   Protester Valentina Burakov said her father was killed in the
Stalinist repression of the 1930s and she came to the meeting ``so
this would never happen again.''
   Parliamentarian Yuri Afanasiev called for transformation of the
Soviet Union into a union of independent states. He warned that
President Gorbachev's call for a strong presidency could restore
totalitarianism.

<HEAD>Trauma Center Closing Blamed Partly on Financial Losses From Gang
Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mounting financial losses, caused in
part by the cost of treating indigent gang-violence victims from
neighboring Los Angeles, prompted the planned closing of a hospital
trauma center, officials said.
   Huntington Memorial Hospital announced Friday it will close its
emergency-care center at the end of April. The hospital, which lost
$3.7 million last year, rejected Los Angeles County's offer of $1.6
million to offset losses if they would keep the trauma center open.
   ``It took a lot of careful soul-searching and debate to do this,
but we simply could no longer afford to absorb the loss,'' said
Allen W. Mathies Jr., the hospital's president and chief executive
officer. ``We believe the trauma network is an important concept,
but we can no longer sustain such a loss.''
   Its closing leaves just 12 such centers in the county's trauma
center network, down from 23 when the system opened in 1983.
   It is yet another instance in a national trend that's seeing the
shutdown of more city hospitals offering special care for trauma,
the medical name given to life-threatening injuries. In Miami,
Chicago, Philadelphia and elsewhere, private hospitals have been
shutting down trauma units, most of which opened in the mid-1980s,
the specialty's boom years.
   Several emergency-care officials said Huntington's decision to
close was prompted by complaints by hospital physicians about the
lack of reimbursement for treating poor patients.
   Some doctors said they were tired of treating shooting victims
from gang-plagued south-central Los Angeles, nearly 20 miles south
of Pasadena, and other areas far away from the city of largely
middle- and upper-class neighborhoods.
   ``You can't help but be unhappy that when you have a patient due
for surgery and you have to postpone it to deal with a gunshot
victim from south-central,'' said Dr. David Faddis, a surgeon at
Huntington. ``Nobody was happy with the situation, but I'm sure
most of the surgeons would agree that if they could have kept the
trauma center open, they would have.''

   Riot police dragged away
pro-democracy protesters to break up an unauthorized rally Sunday,
but they allowed a sanctioned protest demanding that Soviet rulers
give up their grip on power.
   About 8,000 people ignored rumors of impending violence and took
part in the second rally, which officials authorized as part of
nationwide protests demanding radical political and economic
reforms.
   ``In February 1917, we started on the road to democracy. In
October, we got dictatorship. Now there is a similar situation,''
Ilya Konstantinov, a candidate for the March 4 Russian
parliamentary elections, told the crowd outside the Lenin
Sports-Concert Complex.
   Leningrad, the site of three uprisings while it was capital of
the Russian Empire, has been dubbed the ``cradle of revolution.''
In 1905, czarist forces fired on demonstrators demanding democratic
reforms in a clash known as ``Bloody Sunday.''
   Sunday was the anniversary of another uprising, the 1917
February Russian Revolution, in which bourgeois-democratic forces
seized power and forced Czar Nicholas II to abdicate.
   The Bolshevik Communists, led by Vladimir I. Lenin, took over
eight months later.
   Leningrad, the country's second-largest city with 5 million
residents, has been a political hotspot ever since, and on Sunday
was in the spotlight again.
   An hour before the rally at the sports complex, about a dozen
activists in the Democratic Union, a radical group fighting to end
the Communist Party's grip on power, gathered on a square outside
the Young Spectators Theater.
   As a column of 100 police surrounded the crowd and KGB
plainclothes agents stood by, an officer approached and shouted
through a megaphone that no demonstration was authorized.
   A dozen riot police wearing white helmets and green bulletproof
vests then stormed in and dragged away several of the activists,
who had no protest posters and had not made any public statements.
   The activists, some carried by the police, were loaded onto
buses for detention. A parliamentary candidate and Associated Press
photographer Dominique Mollard also were taken away but later
released after their identification documents were checked.
   One activist climbed atop a yellow construction crane and
unfurled a cloth banner that referred to the March 4 elections.
``Boycott _ It's your First Step to Freedom!'' it read.
   He threw to the crowd below slips of paper that carried the same
slogan along with, ``Participation in elections allows a
continuation of the 72-year experiment on Russia.''
   It was signed, Democratic Union.
   Five riot police quickly mounted the crane and dragged down the
protester.
   Posters at the sports complex later also urged a boycott of the
elections and one used a 1917 quote from Lenin to attack the
current leadership. ``At the top is shame and disorder. The party
in power protects its scoundrels,'' read a red banner with white
letters hanging on the marble speaker's platform.
   Writer Mikhail Chulaky, a member of the grass-roots group
People's Front, told the crowd huddling on a wet parking lot under
a gray, rainy sky that the Communist Party's decision earlier this
month to end its monopoly on power was long overdue and added:
``The party of genocide must be disbanded, like (Germany's Nazi
party) was disbanded by Nuremberg.''
   Several speakers attacked President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal to strengthen his powers as president. ``Again they are
wrapping a dictator around our necks,'' said Nikolai Ivanov, a
Soviet parliamentarian from Leningrad whose crusade against
official corruption has made him immensely popular.
   A protest banner equated the presidency with fascism, a powerful
comparison in a city where 600,000 people were killed by the Nazis
in World War II.
   A resolution passed by a show of demonstrators' hands and a
resounding ``Da!'' said the president should be chosen by the
people, not the party apparatus, and urged voters on March 4 to
elect pro-democracy candidates and ``tear power from the
apparatus.''
   Leaders of The People's Front, Leningrad's biggest pro-democracy
group, decided to boycott the rally because they feared retaliation
from either the government or right-wing groups. Dissenting
People's Front members showed up and harshly condemned their
leaders' decision.
   Police and plainclothes KGB agents stood by and did not
interfere in the rally and there were no incidents.

   More than 150,000 people, chanting
``Enough of the nightmare!'' rallied Sunday in the largest
challenge to the Communist regime since hard-line leader Todor
Zhivkov was ousted in November.
   Participants at the rally in Sofia, the capital, also chanted
``Down with the Communist Party!'' and called for democracy.
   The crowd, whose size was estimated by Western reporters,
gathered despite a Communist attempt to defuse popular discontent
by agreeing to concessions sought by opposition parties.
   The party's Supreme Council on Friday announced it will ban
Communist cells in places of work; postpone general elections from
May to June, giving the opposition more time to prepare; and invite
foreign observers to monitor the voting.
   Meantime, the Communist Party is in sole control of government.
Despite reforms, it has resisted compromise with opposition forces
more than Communists in other Eastern European countries.
   The protesters, who gathered in unseasonably balmy weather in
the square in front of party headquarters, cheered as opposition
leader Petko Simeonov declared: ``The winter of our discontent is
at an end! The spring of our struggle has begun!''
   On Friday, the Supreme Council suggested upgrading suspended
talks with the opposition to a ``permanently functioning general
political forum'' to prepare for a transition to democracy. But
opposition speakers were critical Sunday.
   ``The Communist Party wants to improve the image of the round
table, but at the same time it is putting important draft laws
before Parliament behind our backs,'' said Zheljo Zhelev, who heads
the Union of Democratic Forces, which respresents the nation's
major opposition movements.
   The Communists plan to introduce draft legislation at the next
session of the party-controlled Parliament that deals with
constitutional amendments and changes to electoral and party laws.
   The Parliament session opens March 5 and will be carried live by
state radio and television.
   Zhelev demanded that representatives to the talks have a say on
the legislation.
   Simeonov described Sunday's rally as the official start of the
opposition's election campaign, and other speakers proclaimed plans
to hold more mass meetings in an effort to get concessions from the
Communists.
   Speakers at the rally also called for private property and a
market economy.
   In one of the high points of the rally, the crowd accepted by a
show-of-hands vote on a resolution calling on Bulgarians to ``break
with more than four decades of totalitarianism and to distance
themselves from everything that is socialistic.''
   Rally participants, in a symbolic gesture, changed the name of
the square where they had gathered from Sept. Square _ after the
date in 1944 when a national front dominated by the Communists took
over _ to Democracy Square.

   The government, under pressure from
the Roman Catholic Church, Sunday freed more than 150 pro-democracy
student protesters who were beaten and detained after a 10-hour
occupation of Abidjan Cathedral.
   ``We are happy that we secured their release,'' Abbot Athenase
Ake said as freed students fell to their knees before him, kissing
his hand in thanks.
   But state television said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
pardoned the students out of his ``love of the country's youth.''
   In the first official comment on weeklong student protests that
have led to violent clashes with police, Internal Security Minister
Youssouf Koffi said demonstrators are being ``manipulated by
self-serving bandits with ulterior motives.''
   He claimed 70 protesters detained during the unrest were not
university students.
   ``The disorder will stop,'' he said.
   The students freed Sunday raised clenched fists and sang the
national anthem, ``Greetings, Land of Promise,'' in front of the
police station.
   They said they would continue Monday with pro-democracy
protests, which pose the most serious challenge in years to the
conservative government of Houphouet-Boigny.
   The university students say they are angered by the gulf between
rich and poor in this West African nation. They say government
officials live lavishly while ordinary citizens suffer.
   The students are demanding that Houphouet-Boigny step down and
make way for a multiparty democracy. He has ruled the Ivory Coast
as a one-party state since its independence from France in 1960.
   Ake told reporters that Roman Catholic officials felt
responsible for the detention of the students because they left the
cathedral Saturday after clergymen there were assured the students
would be allowed to go free. The students were beaten and detained
when they left the cathedral.
   The dispute threatens normally close relations between the
church and the embattled government of Houphouet-Boigny, an ardent
Catholic.
   State television also announced the postponement until Tuesday
of a meeting between Houphouet-Boigny, legislators and
representatives of businesses, trade unions and professional
organizations.
   The meeting, which was to have been held Monday, is to discuss
the economic crisis caused by slumping cocoa and coffee prices, the
cornerstones of Ivory Coast's once-thriving economy.
   One delegate said the president is expected to announce more of
the austerity measures that have angered students. But the
delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the president
also may meet one student demand by announcing salary cuts for
Cabinet ministers.
   Employees at state-owned companies had their salaries cut 30
percent this month, and the students want the ministers' pay
reduced by that amount.
   Other civil servants have had their salary levels frozen for
eight years.
   In another development, police detained two reporters of the
British-based Reuters international news agency for a few hours
Sunday when they were found talking with students. Police have
threatened foreign reporters covering the protests.
   On Saturday, university and high school students stoned buses
and cars in Yopougoun, forcing police and soldiers to temporarily
cut bus service to the working-class suburb where the unrest began
at a university residence the night of Feb. 19.
   At that time, students set two cars ablaze and were attacked by
police firing tear gas and wielding truncheons.

   From Siberia to the southern republic of Georgia,
hundreds of thousands of Soviets rallied for democracy in more than
30 cities Sunday, despite official warnings that the Soviet Union's
first nationwide protest could explode in violence.
   More than 100,000 people turned out in Moscow, and smaller
protests occurred elsewhere. The official warnings, which were
repeated frequently last week in the state-run media, kept the
turnout low in some cities and prevented some protests altogether.
   Riot police dragged away people who tried to hold an
unsanctioned demonstration in Leningrad, but there were no reports
of major unrest.
   In Moscow, the crowd grew through the afternoon as initial
tension gave way to a relaxed and good-natured atmosphere. One
column of marchers was led by a man with a bullhorn who told police
and bystanders, ``We represent no danger.''
   Gavril Popov, a member of the Congress of People's Deputies and
one of the organizers of the demonstration day, told masses
gathered under cloudy skies that the Communist Party and state
apparatus had engineered a campaign of fear not seen since Stalin
in an attempt to thwart the outpouring of popular sentiment.
   The protests were planned after a successful Feb. 4
pro-democracy rally in Moscow in which about 200,000 people
demanded the Communist Party give up its monopoly on power. The
party did so shortly afterward.
   Thousands of uniformed police and internal security troops
guarded the authorized march route along the broad Garden Ring Road
that circles the city center. Sand-filled dump trucks, water trucks
and snowplows sealed off all roads leading from the Garden Ring
Road into the downtown area where the Kremlin and Red Square were
guarded by more police posted about every 30 feet.
   Estimates of the number of protesters varied widely, from
200,000 reported by the official press agency Novosti, which had a
view of the rally site in Moscow, to a half-million claimed by
Popov.
   An independent newsletter issued by Radio Moscow quoted unnamed
Interior Ministry officials as putting the crowd at 300,000.
   Maj. Gen. Georgy Postoyuk of the Interior Ministry, who said he
was in charge of security at Gorky Park, estimated 100,000 people
gathered at the park. They then marched across a bridge over the
Moscow River and met up with a considerably smaller group that had
gathered at the Foreign Ministry. Together, they headed to the
rally site.
   Reports from police, local activists interviewed by telephone
and state-run media indicated as many as 276,000 people took part
in protest rallies in 32 cities outside Moscow, from
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatky in the Soviet Far East to Leningrad on the
Baltic Sea coast.
   ``All was against us,'' Popov told the crowd in Moscow's
Zubovsky Square.
   ``The City Council was late in announcing the site, time,
routes. Television has special entertainment shows on. The
authorities have waged a campaign of stepping up tensions,
hysteria, rumors, provocations and libel unheard of since 1937,''
when Stalin's campaign of terror reached its height, Popov said.
   With banners, placards and flags, the demonstrators demanded
democratic reforms ranging from direct popular election of the
president to a multiparty system.
   Speakers urged them to endorse progressive candidates running in
March 4 parliamentary elections in the Russian federation and
demanded the ouster of members of the ruling Politburo and Council
of Ministers, as well as KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov.
   With a massive show of hands, the crowd voted in support of a
platform presented by historian and parliament deputy Yuri
Afanasyev that proposed a direct presidential election,
estabishment of private property and the turning over state-run
media from party control to editorial collectives.
   ``We're fed up with how we live,'' said one demonstrator,
Celestine Langovaya, a music teacher in her 50s. ``When (Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev first came to power, I believed in him, but things
have gotten worse for millions of people.''
   Security forces were much in evidence, but more battalions were
held in reserve on side streets and just out of sight behind
buildings and in walled construction sites.
   A special information center of the Novosti Press Agency said
100,000 people gathered on Lenin Square in Minsk, the Byelorussian
capital, for the largest turnout reported outside the Soviet
capital.
   Only about 8,000 demonstrators showed up at the officially
authorized rally site in Leningrad, the nation's second-largest
city. Leaders of the pro-independence People's Front movement there
had urged followers to boycott the event because authorities would
not grant permission to demonstrate in a downtown street.
   Riot police far outnumbered a small group that did try to
demonstrate downtown without official permission. Officers broke up
the attempted protest and dragged demonstrators aboard waiting
buses.
   In Riga, Latvia's capital, no rallies were held for fears of
provoking reprisals by troops, said Uldis Smit of the Latvian
People's Front.
   Authorities in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don
refused to allow any rallies, and about 100 dismayed activists
gathered near the local Communist Party headquarters to hand out
leaflets, the official Tass news agency said.
   Military authorities in Azerbaijan banned all demonstrations,
fearing a renewal of the nationalist violence that led to ethnic
warfare between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in January.
   About 2,000 were said to have gathered in the central Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk, but activists there said many people went to
the wrong places because state-controlled media had refused to
report plans for the rally.
   Elsewhere, local activists said 50,000 people rallied in
Georgia's capital of Tbilisi and 12,000 in the large Siberian city
of Novosibirsk. Another 18,000 people attended two rallies in the
Urals city of Sverdlovsk, they said.
   In Tbilisi, the demonstrators tore down street signs of a street
named after Lenin and renamed it for a prominent Georgian dissident
killed in a car crash last year, a political activist said.
   In Kiev, 50,000 Ukrainians gathered, said Victor Linchevsky, a
spokesman for the grassroots organization Rukh. An angry crowd
later prevented police from detaining three activists, he said.

   A U.S. doctor arrived in New
Zealand Monday to try to reclaim his 7-year-old daughter, who is at
the center of a bitter custody battle and reportedly has not seen
either of her parents for two years.
   The girl's mother, Dr. Jean Elizabeth Morgan, was jailed for 25
months in August 1987, when she refused to say where her daughter
was after a U.S. court gave her former husband unsupervised access
to the child.
   Morgan, a 42-year-old plastic surgeon in Washington, had claimed
her ex-husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually abused the child, a
charge he denies.
   Morgan sent the girl, Hilary Foretich, away with her maternal
grandparents, first to England, then to Christchurch, to prevent
her father from seeing her.
   But Foretich announced Saturday he had located the girl in
Christchurch, where she has been living for nearly two years.
   Morgan reportedly accused him of hunting Hilary down ``like an
animal.''
   Foretich flew from Washington, D.C., into Mangere International
Airport on the North Island and was to fly to Christchurch in the
south for a family court hearing, according to the New Zealand
Press Association.
   ``Certainly, we're going to do what we need to do to rescue my
daughter,'' the Press Association quoted him as saying.
   Morgan is unable to travel to New Zealand because her passport
was taken from her when she went to jail. She was released in
September.
   Hilary was allowed to speak to her mother by telephone Sunday
for the first time in two years, her family said.
   ``When she talked to her mother, she broke down in tears,'' said
her maternal grandmother, Antonia Morgan. ``We've got letters to us
through various channels, but this was the first time she had
spoken on the phone to her.''
   Before he boarded the flight, Foretich, of Falls Church, Va.,
reportedly accused his former wife of waging a media campaign
against him.
   ``I think Elizabeth Morgan and the people who follow her are
very misguided people by the way they're going to make it difficult
for my daughter, and it's really a shame,'' said Foretich, a
45-year-old dental surgeon.
   ``My daughter deserves to come back and have a normal life,''
Radio New Zealand quoted Foretich as saying.
   The mother flung back her own charges, claiming her former
husband sought publicity himself, according to the New Zealand
Press Association.
   ``Eric is the one who has had a publicity agent for I think six
months to a year, not me.''
   ``He has hunted her down like an animal. She does not want to
see him, and he knows that,'' the agency said, quoting her from the
United States.
   William Morgan, the child's maternal grandfather, told
Television New Zealand he would call the police if Foretich tried
to approach Hilary.
   ``He can't do it. I would have to call the police because the
court order says he can't,'' he said.
   The Family Court in Christchurch granted an interim order on
Friday giving the maternal grandparents custody of Hilary.
   Police in New Zealand said attorneys for Foretich lost a bid for
interim custody of Hilary in the Christchurch Family Court on
Friday.
   The mother's lawyer predicted this latest stage in the battle
would be drawn out.
   ``Certainly (there will be) several weeks of preparation and
perhaps two or three months before we have a hearing before the
family court in Christchurch,'' said Lyn Stevens. The court refused
to comment on the case or say when a hearing would be held.
   Foretich will have to ``start from scratch'' in the Family Court
custody battle for Hilary, despite the U.S. order giving him
visitation rights, said Geoff Ellis, a family court lawyer not
involved in the case.
   ``The guardianship law in New Zealand is child-centered rather
than parentally,'' he said Monday.
   Hilary's mother is also believed to be trying to fly to
Christchurch, but she must first go to court to win the return of
her passport.
   A swarm of American journalists was expected to arrive in New
Zealand to cover the case, which is one of the best-known custody
battles in the United States.
   The couple wed in January 1982 but separated seven months later,
a week before Hilary was born. They obtained a divorce that
November on the Carribean island of Haiti, where the marriage took
place.
   Bitter wrangling over Foretich's rights to visit the child
started in 1985, when she was 2{-years old. Accusing him of sexual
abuse, Morgan sought a court order to suspend the visits between
father and daughter.
   In November of that year, Judge Herbert Dixon in the Washington
Superior Court found there was inconclusive evidence of abuse.
   Morgan was also unsuccessful in a federal court jury trial in
mid-1986, which she initiated through a civil lawsuit against her
former husband.

   Some of the indelible ink being used
to mark voters' fingers as a safeguard against multiple voting is
not so indelible, the head of the Supreme Electoral Council
admitted Sunday.
   But the official, Mariano Fiallos, said there were other
safeguards against a citizen voting more than once and there was no
evidence of abuse.
   In a live TV interview, Fiallos said some of the special ink
could be taken off with common laundry bleach. The ink was supposed
to stain for three days.
   Fiallos did not specify to how many of the 4,394 polling places
nationwide the faulty ink had been distributed, saying only that
``some of the inkpots'' were at fault.
   Opposition vice presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy held up a
clean thumb at a news conference and said he'd been able to wash
his finger after voting.
   He said the opposition had received scattered reports from
Managua and the provincial capital of Matagalpa on the problem.
   ``That's something that's being investigated,'' said Dan Evans,
a former senator from Washington state who is here as part of
former President Jimmy Carter's observation team. ``We're tracking
that down. And I doubt it very much if very many people would be
involved in that.''
   Several voters interviewed by The Associated Press said they had
been unable to wash off the ink, and two voters who were asked to
try to wash the ink off with soap and water were unable to do so.
   However, a test with common bleach did remove the ink.
   One voter said he had tried taking the ink off with gasoline and
it would not come off. Others said they had tried lemon or melon
juice or cola.
   Voters who had marked thumbs were showing them off to each
other, proud of having voted.

   Unconventional airplane designer Burt
Rutan, whose Voyager flew around the world without refueling, has
built a new combat jet that flies in the face of the high-tech,
high-cost aviation design ethic.
   The first test model of the new plane, named Ares, will be
rolled out Monday at Rutan's Scaled Composites Inc. at Mojave
Airport in the California high desert.
   The plane, intended to provide ``minimum complexity, maintenance
and acquisition costs,'' is aimed more at foreign markets than the
high-tech U.S. military and its expensive aircraft.
   Rutan's Scaled Composites developed the jet for about $2
million, a fraction of the normal development cost of a military
plane.
   Designed as a light attack aircraft, the twin-tailed Ares is
constructed of composite materials and powered by a single turbofan
engine.
   Composites are construction materials such as graphite and epoxy
that offer strength without the weight of traditional aviation
metals.
   The most distinctive outward feature is the Rutan specialty, a
canard, a small wing forward of the main wing that increases
stability.
   The name comes from the Greek god of war but is used as an
acronym for agile, responsive, effective support.
   The jet was designed to be armed with a 25mm gun and serve a
primary role in close air support and against helicopters. It could
also be armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. A
two-seat version is envisioned for forward air control and training
missions.
   Ares is also suggested for border patrol and reconnaissance
duties as well as drug interdiction missions.
   Overseas sales are the most likely marketing option. The U.S.
Air Force has its sights on high-performance, high-capability jets
like the F-16 and the developing stealth aircraft technology. The
Army has focused its aviation strategy on helicopters.
   Rutan gained worldwide fame for designing Voyager, the delicate,
slender airplane that his brother, Dick, and copilot Jeana Yeager
flew around the world non-stop on a single tank of fuel.
   Other planes had flown around the world by being refueled in
flight, but none had ever made it on their own.
   Rutan used composite carbon-fiber honeycomb materials for light
weight, a canard and fuel-stingy engines to give Voyager the
ability to keep itself aloft for the nine-day, 25,000-mile flight
in December 1986.

<HEAD>Restoration Of Diplomatic Ties Expected During Foreign Minister's
Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland and Israel are expected to restore
full diplomatic relations during a visit by Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, who was to arrive Monday.
   The official PAP news agency said Poland's decision to restore
ties, broken in 1967, acknowledges the error of the decision to
sever them and its consequences, including an anti-Semitic purge in
1968.
   All Warsaw Pact nations except Romania cut diplomatic relations
with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel occupied
Arab territory. Poland will be the second country to restore ties,
after Hungary, which took the step last September.
   Polish-Israeli relations have steadily improved since 1986, when
each country established an interest section in the other's
capital. The interest sections, initially maintained through a
second country with full diplomatic standing, were elevated to
diplomatic missions on Jan. 1, 1989.
   ``The period of abnormality in our contacts is over and now we
should simply embark on building the new structure of relations and
fill it with concrete contents,'' Mordechai Palzur, head of the
Israeli mission in Warsaw, told the Zycie Warszawy newspaper last
week.
   History has given Polish-Israeli contacts a ``special
character,'' Palzur said.
   More than 3.5 million Jews lived in prewar Poland, 3 million of
whom were killed by the Nazis during the World War II occupation.
   Most of the 500,000 who survived emigrated after the war or
following waves of anti-Semitism, the most significant of which
came in 1968 as a result of an internal political struggle. There
are now only several thousand Jews in Poland.
   Poland is ready to ``welcome back'' those who emigrated and
restore Polish citizenship, PAP said.
   In addition, the agency said, Poland is prepared to consider
compensation for the emigres, although negotiations have not begun.
   Poland's new Solidarity-led government is pursuing a course of
evenhanded diplomacy in the Middle East, and is seeking improved
relations with Arab nations, a Foreign Ministry official, Krzysztof
Plominski, said in a recent interview.
   Since September, Poland has established relations for the first
time with the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Katar.
   Last year, Poland withdrew a small stipend it provided to the
Palestinian Liberation Organization's diplomatic mission in Warsaw.
   However, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, meeting Arab
diplomts in January, assured them that Poland supports the
Palestinians' right to a homeland.

   President Corazon Aquino thanked
thousands of cheering people Sunday for supporting her during
repeated coup attempts and accused an opposition senator of
plotting against her.
   Speaking on the fourth anniversary of the revolution that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos and brought her to power, Mrs.
Aquino told 30,000 people: ``No matter how great the threats are,
we will thwart their dark plans.''
   Mrs. Aquino, who has survived six coup attempts, denounced
opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, saying he was trying to rewrite
the history of the military-civilian revolt on Feb. 22-25, 1986,
that became known as the ``people power'' uprising.
   The rebellion began with a military mutiny, led by then-Defense
Minister Enrile, that eventually succeeded when hundreds of
thousands of civilians poured into the streets to protect mutineers
from Marcos' tanks.
   In a radio interview Sunday, Mrs. Aquino said the Enrile
alliance was a ``shotgun marriage'' that fell apart because of
plots against her. Enrile was fired as a minister in November 1986
after a failed coup by his followers.
   On Friday, he ``apologized'' for having helped install Mrs.
Aquino.
   On Sunday, Enrile told reporters that he would not ``answer her
in equal measure'' for her denunciation of him. In a statement,
Enrile also said he felt ``sorry for her for getting too emotional
in discussing issues.''
   Last month, the National Bureau of Investigation recommended
rebellion charges against Enrile for alleged links to a December
coup attempt.
   Enrile denied the charge, and a panel of government lawyers
investigating the coup attempt has not decided whether to indict
the senator.
   ``Never have I heard of such a thing as an `Enrile power'
revolution,'' Mrs. Aquino told the cheering crowd. ``I will talk to
Mr. Enrile or his minions if they are listening: Mr. Enrile, have
you no shame?''
   She said that without popular support, Enrile and his supporters
would have been crushed by Marcos and that Enrile ``gets very
nervous in a crisis.''
   ``Be a man,'' she added. ``Or better yet, be a woman.'' She
thanked the people for their support, saying, ``Without you, Enrile
could have harmed me and I would not be president now. You did not
abandon me.''
   She noted that four years ago, Enrile had admitted to massive
cheating in the Feb. 7, 1986, election in which Marcos was
proclaimed the winner by his rubber-stamp Parliament. Enrile also
admitted faking an ambush on himself in 1972, which Marcos used as
a pretext for declaring eight years of martial law.
   Mrs. Aquino called Enrile ``the great kibitzer'' who ``wanted to
grab the ball as soon as his team was losing and be team captain
himself,'' a reference to his abandoning Marcos in 1986.
   ``The problem with kibitzers is that they get very nervous in a
crisis,'' she said. ``So because of his fear of Marcos, he called
on the people's help, and we remember him confessing to all his
sins.''
   More than 5,000 troops were deployed around Manila during the
outdoor rally because of continuing threats by restive members of
the military, many of whom played key roles in the 1986 mutiny but
later broke with Mrs. Aquino.

   Polar explorer Will Steger is little more
than 100 miles from achieving his goal: crossing Antarctica's 3,600
miles by ski and dog sled.
   ``We're on the home stretch,'' Steger, 45, said Friday on the
trail in an interview published in Sunday's St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch. ``Unless we fall into a crevasse, we should be OK.''
   Welcome banners have been readied for Saturday, and snow has
been plowed flat at the finish line at Mirnyy, the Soviet science
station overlooking the icebergs and penguin colonies of the Indian
Ocean.
   Scientists will converge in the station's kitchen this week to
make miniature Russian dumplings as a treat for members of the
expedition, which has its headquarters in St. Paul.
   U.S. scientists feted Steger's group when it reached the South
Pole on Dec. 11, the first dog sled trek to the bottom of the world
since Roald Amundsen arrived there on Dec. 14, 1911. Steger made
history four years ago when he led a similar assault on the North
Pole.
   The six men could have finished the seven-month International
Trans-Antarctica Expedition five days ahead of schedule. But their
long-awaited finale is being delayed two days past Steger's
self-imposed deadline of Thursday because of contracts with
television stations around the world.
   Most notably, a Soviet-French consortium plans to broadcast the
expedition's finish live from the Antarctic coast at Mirnyy. ABC-TV
Sports may show clips of the finish on ``Wide World of Sports''
Saturday.

   North Korea said Sunday that a U.S. State
Department report accusing it of violating human rights is full of
slander and ``whopping lies.''
   ``The U.S. imperialists are exploiting every means and method
possible to impair the high international prestige of (North Korea)
and block worldwide support and sympathy for its unique socialist
system,'' said a commentary in he official Communist Party
newspaper Rodong Shinmun.
   The commentary, broadcast in part by Pyongyang's Korean Central
News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, followed a U.S. State Department
report last week on human rights around the world. The report's
section on North Korea said that country ``continues to deny its
citizens the most fundamental human rights.''
   Rodong Shinmun declared: ``The United States is a graveyard of
human rights, and U.S. imperialism is the most heinous violator of
human rights in the world and the ringleader of state terrorism. It
is ridiculous, indeed, for them to charge others with `violation of
human rights.'''
   It described the U.S. report as ``vilifying (North Korea) with
whopping lies.''
   Noting that the report also denounced the human rights records
of China and Cuba, Rodong Shinmun said: ``With no intrigue and
slander, however, can the U.S. imperialists block the road of the
countries which advance under the banner of socialism and
anti-imperialist independence.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
reviewed the government's plan for economic reform in talks Sunday
with finance officials, who asked him to speed up pledged U.S. aid,
the official news agency reported.
   Brady said during the one-day visit that the United States seeks
``to support the processes striving for restoring a market-oriented
economy in Eastern Europe'' but must see proof that the nations
will stick to severe reform steps, the news agency PAP said.
   ``We have to be convinced about the constant nature of the
changes that are under way,'' Brady said in an interview with PAP.
   He said all avenues for aid to Poland are still open, ``but one
has to assess their effectiveness first.''
   Poland's finance minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, told PAP that he
discussed with Brady the ``acceleration'' of U.S. aid, especially
for programs to develop private enterprise and expand exports.
   Polish officials have been asking to begin drawing on a $45
million U.S. enterprise fund.
   Poland's $40 billion debt to the West was also discussed. Poland
owes about $3.1 billion of that amount to the United States.
   The government, led by the Solidarity labor movement, is seeking
moratoriums on payments and reduction of the overall debt as a
crucial part of the effort to salvage the shattered economy and
reshape it as a market-driven system.
   The Polish debt is expected to be a key topic during Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's trip to Washington in mid-March.
   Brady's stop in Warsaw followed last week's two-day visit by
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who was
appointed by President Bush to coordinate aid programs for Poland.

   Divers on Sunday recovered the body
of the last of seven people killed when a members of a youth group
and four would-be rescuers fell through thin ice into a lake.
   The body of Dave ``Grandpa'' Meyers was retrieved from Convict
Lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada range, said a Mono County
sheriff's dispatcher.
   The body was spotted by a sophisticated underwater video camera
lowered into the lake Wednesday, but divers were unable to recover
the remains until Sunday. The bodies of the six other people killed
in the accident Feb. 19 were recovered previously.
   Meyers, 53, of Bishop, was a counselor at a home for delinquents
and youths who have committed minor violations. Killed in the
accident were three teen-age boys from the camp, Meyers and another
counselor who went to their aid, and two other rescuers.
   The lake is 250 miles north of Los Angeles.

   The nation's governors put their stamp Sunday
on national education goals, but got no encouragement from the
White House for the prospect of financial help from a ``peace
dividend.''
   ``Our aim is excellence in education,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton
of Arkansas, as he offered the goals to the National Governors'
Association for approval.
   The Arkansas Democrat added that ``I do not believe we will
achieve them (the goals) unless we dramatically change our
behavior.''
   The changes referred to by Clinton were included in a series of
objectives that would put the governors on record as pressing for
specific steps toward implementing the goals first outlined by
President Bush in his State of the Union address last month.
   The governors also adopted a resolution urging the president to
allocate any defense budget savings toward education as well as
reducing the federal budget deficit and other domestic needs.
   ``We have to get this peace dividend,'' said Gov. Roy Romer of
Colorado ``or else we're going to have to make some other change in
this country's policies or else we're not going to close the gap
that we've created.''
   Romer worked with fellow Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York
in drafting the resolution. Cuomo did not attend the NGA session.
   The resolution called on the president ``to dedicate the peace
dividend in a balanced manner between the federal budget deficit,
education and other productivity investments.''
   Earlier, Romer failed in an attempt to get the governors to
adopt a resolution that urged the president to ``direct substantial
federal resources from defense to educational needs and other
productivity investments.''
   ``Otherwise, I don't believe we are going to get the attention
of the federal establishment in helping us meet the goals we have
today,'' Romer said.
   At a state dinner at the White House, Bush toasted the governors
and what he called ``our commitment to work together toward ... an
American education system that is second to none.''
   ``We came together not as Republicans and Democrats, not as
partisan competitors, but as fellow chief executives with our
hearts and minds focused on a single goal: the future of our kids,
the future of our country,'' said Bush.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, the governors' chairman, said, ``We
all expect that there's a lot of work ahead of us.'' He raised his
glass to both the president and Barbara Bush, saying, ``I think we
recognize that the first lady may have had some influence on the
president in this area.''
   The governors were returning to the White House Monday to meet
with Bush.
   Among the earliest reaction to the governors' action was sharp
criticism from Timothy J. Dyer, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals.
   ``America's governors receive an A-plus for rhetoric, but fail
economics,'' said Dyer. ``Their goals are lofty, patriotic, noble
and certainly what we all would like. However, without resources
they are merely wishes.''
   The governors also heard an appeal from four mayors for more
resources for their efforts to combat drugs.
   The mayors sought the governors' support in allowing some
federal funds for drug programs to go directly to major cities
rather than be channeled through the state governments.
   Testifying were Mayors Richard L. Berkley of Kansas City, Mo.;
W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia; Sue Myrick of Charlotte, N.C.; and
Maureen O'Connor of San Diego.
   ``Get those federal dollars where they're needed most,''
appealed Goode.
   ``We mayors want direct funding for cities because it doesn't
always get to us,'' said Myrick.
   The educational objectives were drafted in consultation with the
White House and were broad enough to be acceptable to all.
   But on the touchier question of how to pay for improved
education, the governors got no commitments from Richard G. Darman,
the White House budget director.
   Darman reminded the governors that the budget Bush sent to
Congress for the next fiscal year included a $500 million increase
in federal funding for the Head Start program.
   But beyond that, Darman would only say that ``the political
system is going to have to have its debate over the division of
responsibility.''
   Romer contended that for the past 50 years the federal
government had been taking a growing share of the nation's tax base
and using much of it for national security.
   ``I firmly believe the threat to our security is no longer
superior military forces,'' Romer said. ``It is inadequate skill
levels.''
   ``You have the tax base, we've got the problem,'' the Colorado
governor said.
   Romer asked Darman if he would consider taking a percentage of
federal tax receipts and sending it to the states to be used as
state officials decide.
   ``I'll be happy to have us look at any specific proposal,''
Darman replied. ``I'm not entirely sure I agree with your premise.''
   Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio asked Darman about some
$250 billion of unexpended Pentagon obligations that might no
longer be needed.
   The budget director said those Pentagon funds were in contracts
which require the government to pay a penalty if it cancels them.
   He said the savings ``won't be anywhere near the number that you
mentioned.''
   The education goals called for improvement in pre-school
programs so that ``all children in America will start school ready
to learn.''
   Others called for increasing the high school graduation rate to
90 percent and improving student competency in subjects such as
English, mathematics, science, history and geography.

   Gunmen ambushed and killed a leading
Yugoslav expatriate as he sat in his car in a suburb Sunday
afternoon, police reported.
   Witnesses told police that several men shot Enver Hadri,
chairman of the Belgian Committee for Human Rights in Kosovo, in
his car in the Brussels suburb of Saint Gilles.
   Hadri died about four hours later at a nearby hospital, police
said.
   Witnesses told police the murderers fled in a Volkswagen.
   Other expatriates from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, quoted
by the Belgian news agency Belga, said it was a political murder.
However, there were no details.
   Kosovo is a southern region of Serbia, but the majority of the
population is of Albanian origin and wants more freedom from the
central government. The province has been the scene of riots and
protests reflecting tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

<HEAD>Fence Separating Blacks from Whites in Cemetery Is Ordered Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fence separating poorly tended graves for
blacks from nicely kept graves for whites must come down, says a
judge who further ordered an end to 125 years of unequal upkeep in
a private cemetery.
   Lebanon's blacks call the back of Ryder Cemetery ``the jungle''
because weeds, trash and brambles have overrun the more than 200
graves of their loved ones. On the other side of a rusty wire fence
are graves for whites with gleaming tombstones on well-tended
grassy knolls.
   ``It was wrong,'' said Norman Moore, former president of the
Marion-Washington County chapter of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. ``It was degrading to see.''
   The plaintiffs _ the local NAACP and some individuals _ say they
hope the order, which comes seven years after a lawsuit was filed
over the practice, will finally put a disturbing remnant of
segregation to rest.
   Elizabeth Mendel, Ryder Cemetery Co.'s lawyer, said her client
will decide whether to appeal after U.S. District Judge Charles
Allen specifies what work needs to be done.
   The judge's order, issued earlier this month, simply directs the
cemetery to remove the wire fence and ``provide equal care to all
sections.''
   Three years ago, the cost of getting the black side up to the
white side's maintenance level was estimated at $50,000.
   The 30-acre cemetery, incorporated on land donated in 1865 by a
German immigrant, appears to have been segregated from the start.
Although no records exist to explain the arrangement, the cemetery
company never maintained the ``colored section'' or took money for
plots in it, but left maintenance to blacks, who sometimes
collected fees.
   For more than 10 years, blacks willing to buy the $200 plots
have been buried with whites on the cemetery's well-tended side.
   But most blacks say they want to be laid to rest near relatives
in the black burial ground.
   ``In the summer the weeds are up over my head,'' said Lily Mae
Bell, whose husband is buried on the black side and whose son is on
the white side.
   Bell, 71, said she likes to visit both graves but finds it a
chore to pick her way around the fence, which is topped with barbed
wire, and make her way through the field.
   ``You really get muddy,'' said Bell, who was a plaintiff in the
suit.
   Thelma Riley, 63, another plaintiff, said: ``The fence is what
burned me up. You go and see it and wonder why. I told somebody,
`Nobody's ever going to come up out of the grave and walk over to
the other side.'''

   Hampshire College has produced nine Oscar
nominees in its 19-year history, an achievement that alumni say
showcases the starring role of their design-your-own-degree
curriculum.
   ``The whole thing just boils down to a very simple thing ... It
is the proof that Hampshire College not only works, which 20 years
ago was a big question mark, but it works fantastically,'' said
graduate Ken Burns.
   Burns has been nominated twice for an Academy Award in the
documentary category, for ``Brooklyn Bridge,'' and ``The Statue of
Liberty.''
   Robert Epstein, one of two Hampshire graduates to win Oscars,
was nominated this year in the best full-length documentary feature
category as a co-director of ``Common Threads: Stories from the
Quilt.'' The documentary is about the AIDS quilt being pieced
together in front of the White House.
   Epstein took home an Academy Award in 1985 for his documentary
on Harvey Milk, the San Francisco homosexual politician who was
murdered.
   In all graduates have been nominated nine times for Academy
Awards.
   In 1986 graduate Thomas Sigel won in the best documentary short
category for his film, ``Witness to War: Doctor Charley Clemens.''
   Hampshire opened in 1970 as an alternative to the traditional
education offered at nearby Smith, Amherst and Mount Holyoke
colleges and the University of Massachusetts.
   Students at the college design their own courses of study and
advance through three divisional examinations requiring them to
complete individual research projects.
   That freedom may explain why students have been able to catch
the eye of the academy, film professor Jerome Leibling said.
   ``The fact that they think they can design it and do it
themselves ... film lends itself to that. It's disciplined, but
it's also spontaneous. We allow that to happen. They're not being
being graded or pushed and they can absorb a great deal,'' he said.
   Burns, who is finishing a nine-part history of the Civil War to
be broadcast on public television, said Hampshire students weren't
spoon-fed and ``that has really put us in a good position to
capitalize on our particular area of expertise when we got out into
the real world.''
   Film graduates have to complete a film and Leibling said some of
the most successful alumni produced work that helped them step up
to the professional level.
   ``I think that's very important,'' he said. ``We have an idea
that it is doable and that they can do it and we have the equipment
and the time.''
   He said he wasn't sure why students have been so successful in
the field of documentary and short films, although he noted others
have gone on to more commercial success in Hollywood.

   The top official in Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's home province has stepped down after weeks of
bloody political clashes that prompted charges the government could
not maintain order.
   The chief minister of Sind Province, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, handed
in his resignation to Ms. Bhutto late Saturday. On Sunday night,
the provincial assembly elected a distant relative of the prime
minister, Aftab Shabaan Mirani, to replace Shah.
   At least 70 people have died in recent ethnic strife in the
southern port city of Karachi, Sind's capital and Pakistan's
largest city with 8 million people.
   Many officials in the governing national Pakistan People's Party
had criticized Shah's leadership, accusing his government of being
unable to control the volatile situation.
   Most of the clashes have been between supporters of Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, made up of
Moslem immigrants who fled to Pakistan from India when Pakistan was
created in 1947.
   The violence peaked on Feb. 7 and 8. Clashes between police and
sharpshooters belonging to rival political groups left scores dead
and hundreds wounded.
   On Sunday, the English-language Nation newspaper reported that a
politician from the Mohajir movement was killed the day before
while he was sitting in his shop. There were no details.

   More than 700 protesters marched Sunday to denounce
the shooting of Nagasaki's mayor by a rightist angered by the
official's comment that the late Emperor Hirohito bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   ``Let's discuss the emperor system more freely!'' protesters
shouted as they marched a mile through Nagasaki, on Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu.
   They carried banners with slogans reading ``Freedom of speech
with no taboo'' and ``Denounce terrorism.''
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, 68, was shot in the back on Jan. 18 at
the entrance to Nagasaki's city hall. He was released from a
hospital Wednesday.
   Police arrested Kazumi Tajiri, 40, of Tokyo, a member of a
rightist group, five hours after the shooting. They said Tajiri had
admitted shooting the mayor.
   An official of the Nagasaki state police, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Sunday's demonstrations were orderly, and there
were no disturbances by rightists.
   Before he was shot, Motoshima was subjected to more than a year
of threats for his December 1988 remark that Hirohito ``shares
responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that
period.''
   His remarks outraged rightists, many of whom revere the imperial
family.
   Hirohito, who died in January 1989, was worshipped as a living
god before renouncing his divine status after World War II.
   Motoshima and some others maintain Hirohito could have ended the
war sooner, sparing Nagasaki from the atomic attack on Aug. 9,
1945, three days after a nuclear strike on Hiroshima.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with State Department and DEA
spokespersons confirmation of pending report and reaction to Times
estimates</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration confirmed Sunday that
it has determined marijuana production in Mexico is much higher
than it previously estimated but downplayed reports of a tenfold
increase.
   The Los Angeles Times on Sunday reported new U.S. figures, to be
released this week, concluded Mexico produces 10 times more
marijuana than previously beleived.
   The newspaper said the official U.S. estimate _ derived from CIA
spy satellite photographs _ concluded that Mexico produced 47,500
metric tons of marijuana in 1989. In 1988, the U.S. estimated
Mexico's production at 4,750 metric tons.
   Katherine Shaw, spokeswoman for the State Department's
international narcotics section said the agency would release an
annual report on foreign narcotic production and anti-drug efforts
later this week.
   ``This is not a tenfold increase in one year,'' Shaw said of
estimates on Mexican marijuana production. ``This is a revised
estimate for 1989. There's a high probability things were much
higher than we thought for a long time.''
   Shaw said the estimates for the previous few years were
relatively low and the new figure for 1989 is based on new
methodology. The figure for 1988 she said was ``unsupportable.''
   ``It's just been much higher than we've thought and this year we
can prove it.''
   U.S. officials have long suspected Mexico was underestimating
its marijuana production figures. The U.S. figures are expected to
be released Thursday, the Times said.
   Shaw would not confirm the 47,500 metric ton production figure
reported by the Times.
   An administraation official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the number was ``in the ball park'' and noted that
it reflected marijuana production after eradication efforts.
   Anti-drug officials told the newspaper the figures don't mean
production in Mexico has exploded, but rather that previous
estimates, based largely on information supplied by the Mexican
government, were too low.
   Despite the new information, the Bush administration plans to
certify that the Mexican government has cooperated in illegal drug
suppression and is eligible for foreign aid, the paper said. But
the disclosure is expected to inflame Congress.
   When asked whether Mexico would be certified as having
cooperated sufficiently in anti-drug efforts to receive its full
foreign aid Shaw said, ``the president hasn't signed any piece of
paper yet.''
   Mexico's deputy attorney general, Javier Coello Trejo, when told
of the figures during a meeting with Drug Enforcement
Administration chief John C. Lawn, ``nearly went into apoplexy,''
the Times said, quoting a source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But not everyone inside the Drug Enforcement Administration is
convinced the new figures are correct, including John P. Sutton,
who heads the agency's cannabis investigation section.
   He called the estimates ``inordinate'' and ``wild'' and said the
U.S. analysts mistakenly included in their count ``ditch weed,''
wild-growing marijuana that lacks the kick of cannabis sold for
smoking and has no commercial value. He also suggested other
vegetation may have been included in the marijuana count.
   Frank Shults, DEA spokesman said, ``the development of
production estimates is very soft and it always has been.''
   ``We never say we know how much of any drug is growing
anywhere,'' he added.
   But others, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
conclusions were solid. ``This is the first time we've done it
right,'' one-high ranking source told the newspaper. The satellite
pictures permitted estimates from areas where the Mexican
government previously denied surveillance flights.
   By contrast, estimates for Colombian marijuana production went
up to 2,810 metric tons for 1989, a slight increase from the 2,740
metric tons reported for 1988. In the United States, production for
1989 was estimated at 5,500 metric tons, with 4,600 metric tons for
1988.
   Other strains between the Bush administration and Mexico include
a disclosure that the Mexican ruling party reportedly made a covert
contribution of $11 million to the re-election campaign of
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   The Mexican government has also expressed anger over U.S.
complaints of official foot-dragging and failure to cooperate in
the investigation of the kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena in 1985.

<HEAD>Two Players Winner $52 Million Jackpot in Illinois Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Illinois lottery players accomplished what
millions have failed to do in three previous weeks, matching all
six Lotto numbers to capture a grand prize of about $52 million,
the lottery director said Sunday.
   Despite cold weather and blowing snow that caused accidents and
closed roads, ticket sales peaked Saturday afternoon, hours before
the drawing for the second biggest Lotto prize in Illinois history,
Illinois State Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said at a morning news
conference.
   ``We ended up selling nearly $37 million worth of Lotto tickets
in the past week,'' she said. The total revenue collected for
payouts in Saturday's Lotto was more than $72 million, she said.
   The large grand prize and high sales volume followed three
straight rollovers of the Lotto jackpot after no one matched all
six numbers in the drawings of Feb. 3, Feb. 10 and Feb. 17. In its
16-year history, the Illinois lottery has never had a weekly
jackpot roll over four times.
   The previous biggest Illinois jackpot was $69.9 million, divided
by four Lotto players who each matched all six numbers in the
drawing of April 15, 1989.
   The weekend's winning numbers were 25, 31, 35, 36, 39 and 47. As
usual, the winners' identities cannot be confirmed until they step
forward and have their tickets validated by lottery officials.

   Driven by a rare chance for
permission to build homes in this scenic ski and gambling resort,
about 140 people spent a fourth day camped outside the library in
snow and below-zero temperatures.
   The would-be builders _ some huddled in crudely built igloos and
snow caves _ held their ground even though the county government on
Friday withdrew a plan to issue the coveted permits on a
first-come, first-served basis Monday morning. A smaller contingent
waited outside City Hall, hoping for a crack at a separate batch of
permits controlled by the city government.
   The impromptu camp-out demonstrates the voracious appetite for
property in this town that boasts ski slopes, scenic vistas _ and a
chance to gamble just across the state line in Nevada.
   Tough anti-development policies enacted in the early 1970s have
kept construction at a virtual standstill around Lake Tahoe, in the
Sierra Nevada within a day's drive of San Francisco.
   ``The people in front of us have waited 14 years to build on
their lot,'' said Diane Rosner, one of about 60 outside City Hall.
   Concerned about the line and spurred by allegations of
favoritism in the permit process, the El Dorado County Board of
Supervisors voted Friday to cancel their plans to issue 123 permits
by lottery.
   But the applicants, who began lining up Wednesday, vowed to
stay, and to sue if the lottery didn't proceed.
   ``We do not intend to be dispersed,'' said Doug Rosner, a South
Lake Tahoe real estate broker who was 34th in the line Sunday.
   Dale Sare, an attorney for about 100 permit applicants, said his
clients would to remain in line until Monday morning and will sue
unless the county issues the permits.
   With rare exceptions, building has been stopped in the Tahoe
basin since the early 1970s in an effort to save Lake Tahoe from
being clogged with algae caused by nutrients that wash off cleared
land and into the lake.
   A settlement to numerous lawsuits was recently reached, and
officials of the city and four counties which have territory in the
moratorium area are working out how to issue permits.
   In an emergency session late Friday, county supervisors withdrew
their plan, saying they would decide March 6 how to issue the
permits.
   The city of South Lake Tahoe planned to make 62 permits
available Friday on a first-come, first-served basis.

   Water contaminated with crude
oil from a tanker spill broke through a berm Sunday and flowed into
a marsh, covering at least three birds in oil.
   ``There is a minor threat there,'' said Gary Gorman, director of
the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, which is trying to
restore the 25-acre marsh into a wetlands wildlife habitat.
   The oil got into a mud flat and pickle weed that is habitat for
federally listed endangered birds. The birds soaked in oil were
taken to cleaning stations, said Gorman.
   Workers from the Orange County Flood Control District rebuilt
the berm while clean-up crews tried to contain the oil, Huntington
Beach Fire Battalion Chief Dennis Groat said.
   A ruptured oil tanker spilled 400,000 gallons of crude off
Huntington Beach Feb. 7, closing 12 miles of beaches in Orange
County, south of Los Angeles. The last of the crude washed ashore
last week.
   A combination of high tide and surf overwhelmed the earthen berm
and water containing oil from the rocks spilled over the top,
flowing toward the marsh.

   Thousands of people chanting
``Duarte! Duarte!'' lined the streets Sunday for former president
Jose Napoleon Duarte, who was buried with honors and eulogized as
``the father of Central American democracy.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias,
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo and former Honduran President
Jose Azcona Hoyos attended a Roman Catholic funeral Mass for
Duarte, who died Friday. He was 64.
   Arias and Cerezo were among the pallbearers for the founder of
the Christian Democratic Party. Party leaders criticized the
rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani as ``niggardly''
for not declaring a national day of mourning.
   At least 100,000 people paid their last respects to the departed
former president, party leaders said.
   Duarte's followers, many carrying photographs of the former
president and cheering, ``Duarte! Duarte!'' tossed flowers at his
flag-draped coffin as it was carried from the church to a 21-gun
military salute.
   Arias, speaking at the Mass, called Duarte ``the father of
Central American democracy.''
   ``Napoleon was a visionary pioneer and an untiring fighter for
democracy,'' Arias said.
   Cerezo referred to criticisms of Duarte's 1984-1989 term as
president but said, ``I think the magnitude and value of his work
still has not been fully appreciated.''
   He ``gave his life for the cause of all democrats of Latin
America,'' Cerezo said.
   Duarte, who tried but failed to end a civil war and ease El
Salvador's searing class division, died at his San Salvador home
after struggling against stomach and liver cancer for almost two
years.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, who succeeds Duarte as the Christian
Democratic leader, criticized the government for not declaring a
day of mourning but added: ``the people were in mourning, anyway,
which is the important thing.''
   Cristiani was unable to attend the funeral because he is on a
state visit to Taiwan. Cristiani, who represented the oligarchy
that Duarte has fought for decades took over as president in June
1989 after his conservative Nationalist Republic Alliance, or
Arena, defeated the Christian Democrats.
   Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San Salvador and Arena president,
said: ``Duarte was an expression of democratic will. He made great
contributions toward the democratization of the country.''
   ``We have been strong adversaries,'' Calderon said. But, he
added, ``It would be unjust not to recognize President Duarte's
palpable efforts for human rights (and) struggle for freedom of
expression.''
   Duarte's body was transported to a private cemetary in southern
San Salvador for burial.
   After founding the Christian Democratic Party, Duarte was
tortured and exiled for seven years. He returned in 1980 and headed
a civilian junta until he was chosen president in 1984 in the
country's first elections in 50 years.

   Arctic air Sunday brought an abrupt end to weeks of unseasonably
mild weather in the Northeast, and roads slippery with snow created
numerous chain-reaction pileups and forced cancellation of church
services.
   ``We didn't get January in January, so we're getting it in late
February,'' said Mel Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at
Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.
   Two days after highs reached the mid-60s in New York City,
Philadelphia and Boston, Sunday's afternoon readings were only in
the low to mid-20s, with wind gusting to 30 mph in New York.
   The National Weather Service said Boston would chill to zero
overnight with wind making it feel like 35 below.
   By Sunday evening, 4 inches of snow had fallen in Boston, the
weather service said. Across Massachusetts, snowfalls ranged from 4
to 10 inches.
   The snow caused a 30-car fender-bender on Interstate 91 near
Holyoke, Mass., but state police reported only minor damage and no
injuries.
   Blowing snow was being blamed for a massive chain-reaction
pileup on Interstate 87 near Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Fifteen people
suffered minor injuries. A person at the scene said a whiteout from
the blowing snow blinded several drivers, who began sliding
sideways and banging into each other.
   Real temperatures _ without the wind factored in _ were expected
to drop as low as 25 below zero Monday morning in parts of the
Adirondack Mountains in northern New York, said weather service
forecaster Larry Bach in Albany.
   Nearly a foot of snow fell in parts of Connecticut, with
accumulations ranging from 10{ inches in Litchfield and 10 in New
Canaan to 5 inches in Vernon, Colchester and Norwich, the National
Weather Service said.
   Roads were treacherous and several accidents were reported,
including one involving a bus on Interstate 84 in Manchester in
which 13 people received minor injuries, state police said.
   The storm that hit New England started Saturday around the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley.
   Chain-reaction crashes involving as many as 100 vehicles and
other traffic accidents in bad weather killed 13 people in Ohio
Saturday, nine of them in one pileup; three in Illinois; and one
each in Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky.
   Among the churches that canceled services was First Baptist in
Norwood, Mass., said Ron Nicholas, the church's pastor. ``Several
of our people who came in on the hope of setting up had seen
several accidents,'' he said.
   As far south as North Carolina, winds reached up to 50 mph,
blowing trees and limbs onto utility lines and causing at least
3,500 people to lose power over the weekend, authorities said.
   Overnight temperatures Saturday ranged from 5 below zero at
Mount Mitchell, N.C., to 19 degrees in Murphy.
   Power company crews were out in force over the weekend repairing
downed lines.
   Ohio was especially hard hit by Saturday's storm.
   Nine counties were closed _ all roads shut down _ under snow
emergencies and thousands of homes were without power during the
storm, which ended early Sunday. Service had been restored to most
electrical customers by Sunday.
   Seneca County's closing stranded fans overnight at the Ohio
Conference women's basketball championships at Heidelberg College.
   ``Some of them spent the night in university rooms, some of them
stayed in local hotels and we sent some to St. Francis Convent in
Tiffin because we ran out of room,'' said Vicki Lucas, a college
security officer.
   At least nine people were killed and 55 injured in an 18-vehicle
crash on Interstate 75 outside Dayton, Ohio, Saturday while three
pileups involving a total of 99 vehicles snarled traffic on I-75
near Findlay.
   ``In my 18 years, this is by far the worst I've ever seen,''
State Highway Patrol Lt. Dan Dickerson said of the pileup near
Dayton.
   At least one gas tank burst into flames, and witnesses said
thick smoke hampered rescue efforts. ``There was cars all over the
place. We could hear people screaming. It was just terrible,'' said
Alice Haynes, whose car was hit from behind.
   On Sunday, Ohio police and wrecker crews finished clearing the
tangle of twisted and burned vehicles from the snow-covered stretch
of I-75.
   In Michigan, only minor injuries were reported in three crashes
on I-94 involving at least 130 vehicles in all, and in a
100-vehicle collision on I-75 north of Pontiac.

   California Attorney General John Van de
Kamp formally launched his campaign for governor Sunday in rival
Dianne Feinstein's political backyard with a scathing attack on her
record as mayor of San Francisco.
   Van de Kamp began with a rally at the Mission High School boys'
gymnasium, in the heart of the city where Feinstein served nine
years as mayor, and ripped into Feinstein's fiscal management and
her record on civil rights, insurance, the environment and women's
issues.
   ``Dianne Feinstein's budget mismanagement turned the city by the
bay into the city that could not pay,'' Van de Kamp said, accusing
her of being evasive on how she would balance the state budget.
   Van de Kamp describing himself as a candidate who ``is going to
change California'' with environmental, political ethics and drug
reforms.
   A spokesman for Feinstein called Van de Kamp's attack a sign of
desperation in the wake of the most recent poll on the June 5
Democratic primary, in which the former mayor pulled ahead of the
attorney general.
   The kickoff announcement is only a formality, since Van de Kamp,
like Feinstein, has been actively campaigning for a year and leads
Feinstein in fund raising by $4.6 million to $2.3 million.
   The winner of their June 5 primary will face the expected
Republican nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in November. Incumbent
Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, is retiring.
   Van de Kamp's campaign for governor is tied closely to three
ballot initiatives he is sponsoring on the environment, legislative
ethics and crime. The content of Van de Kamp's initiatives has also
stirred controversy. Part of his crime initiative duplicates an
initiative sponsored by Wilson, except for deletion of privacy
language which Van de Kamp claims could undermine a woman's right
to abortion, and his political ethics initiative contains a
controversial limit on the terms of legislators.
   The ethics proposal has strained Van de Kamp's relations with
legislative leaders of his own party, not only because of the
proposed limit on their terms, but especially because of a
supporting article Van de Kamp wrote in which he said of the
Legislature, ``if we want clean government, it's time to drain the
swamp.''
   Van de Kamp, 54, is a member of the wealthy Pasadena family
which formerly owned the frozen food company and the Southern
California bakery chain which still carry the family name.
   Before his election as attorney general in 1982, Van de Kamp
served seven years as Los Angeles County district attorney, five
years as federal public defender and two years as assistant federal
public defender in Los Angeles.

   President Bush said Sunday he and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed in weekend talks that
a unified Germany would continue as ``a full member of NATO,''
including military participation in the Western alliance. Kohl said
``neutralism would be a very false solution.''
   After two days of discussions regarding delicate issues of a
unified Germany, Kohl said he recognizes ``the legitimate security
interests of all states'' in Europe, particularly Poland.
   ``Nobody needs to be afraid,'' the West German leader said. Bush
chimed in that if he were alarmed about the prospect of a single
Germany, he would not be endorsing reunification _ as he had
several times previously.
   There have been fears in Poland _ decimated by the Nazis in
World War II _ that a new Germany would seek to regain border
territory that was formerly under German rule.

   The nation's governors put their stamp Sunday
on national education goals, but got no encouragement from the
White House for the prospect of financial help from a ``peace
dividend.''
   The executive committee of the National Governors' Association
expanded the six goals proclaimed by President Bush in his State of
the Union address last month by spelling out a series of specific
objectives.
   The governors also endorsed a resolution calling on the
president ``to dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced manner
between the federal budget deficit, education and other
productivity investments.''
   Democratic Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado failed in an attempt to
get the governors to adopt a resolution that urged the president to
``direct substantial federal resources from defense to educational
needs and other productivity investments.''

   Former President Reagan repeatedly endorsed
false letters to Congress in his videotaped testimony for John
Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial.
   The letters, written by former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane and which form the basis of one of the criminal charges
against Poindexter, categorically deny that Oliver North was
raising money or giving military advice to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Reagan said he does not know to this day that the letters were
false. He also said he did not know that McFarlane, Poindexter's
predecessor in the Reagan White House, pleaded guilty to crimes in
connection with the letters or that the Tower Board that Reagan
appointed three years ago concluded that North had been assisting
the Contras militarily.
   Poindexter, facing trial March 5 on charges of conspiracy,
obstructing Congress and making false statements, sent responses to
Congress in 1986 that embraced McFarlane's letters of the previous
year.

   Louis Sullivan, after a shaky start as the
nation's top health official, has seized the anti-smoking campaign
as his own, winning kudos from Congress and grabbing headlines with
talk of ``blood money'' and ``trading death for corporate profits.''
   Following the well-worn path of previous federal health
officials, Sullivan, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
has cranked up the war of words against tobacco companies to new
heights.
   ``He certainly has found an area where he has been willing to be
outspoken and has taken the leadership,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee.
   But some say smoking is a safe issue, since Sullivan isn't
attacking tobacco subsidies or proposing a ban on advertising. And
they say Sullivan, who for nearly a year has run the federal
department with the largest budget, has yet to show such bold
leadership on the larger issues confronting the administration,
including the nation's soaring health-care bill.

   A Democratic candidate for governor who
borrowed the Republicans' Willie Horton strategy was forced to
apologize after the tactic was denounced as racist and prejudicial
to a defendant.
   Gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Bill Nelson kicked off his campaign
Feb. 14 by promising to make a Florida case involving a black
defendant into his rival's ``Willie Horton _ only worse.'' On
Friday, he issued his apology.
   The six-term congressman is considered the front-runner among
the three Democrats seeking a chance to challenge first-term
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez. Martinez also has three Republican
challengers.
   Horton, who had spent 10 years in prison in Massachusetts for
murder, escaped during a furlough in 1987 and raped a Maryland
woman and assaulted her fiance. A commercial during President
Bush's 1988 campaign blamed Democrat Michael Dukakis for the
tragedy and was credited as a major factor in the Massachusetts
governor's defeat.

   More than 100,000 people turned out in Moscow, and smaller

turnout low in some cities and prevented some protests altogether.
   Riot police dragged away people who tried to hold an

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. owes millions of
dollars to lawyers who helped defend the collapsed Wall Street firm
and its employees during the government's lengthy insider trading
investigation.
   Atop the list is Drexel's main outside counsel, which has claims
to $2.1 million in back fees, and attorneys for indicted junk bond
ex-king Michael Milken, whose monthly allowance of about $1 million
wound down when Drexel went belly up.
   ``There are outstanding fees they haven't paid and they're not
going to pay anything going forward,'' said a Milken associate who
asked not to be named.
   When Drexel became entangled in the largest Wall Street criminal
probe ever, the firm promised to pick up the tab for all current or
former employees who became involved.
   In addition, the demise of the firm that dominated Wall Street
junk-bond dealmaking is affecting big law firms that derived a
large amount of work from Drexel's criminal woes and its day-to-day
securities business.
   A slowdown on Wall Street _ investment banking firms need
lawyers for activities from underwriting stocks to completing
mergers _ hasn't helped either.
   ``There are more than a few lawyers who will be poorer for all
this,'' said Columbia University law professor Harvey Goldschmid.
``Because of the deals and the prominence, Drexel has been a
terribly important player for a meaningful part of the legal
community in New York.''
   Roger Meltzer, a partner with Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, which has
represented Drexel for 10 years, conceded that Drexel's demise
would hurt, but added that the firm has a ``substantial and diverse
client base.'' The firm reportedly did about $10 million in Drexel
business a year. Cahill Gordon said in court papers it is owed $2.1
million.
   ``This firm is not based on the financial health of one
client,'' Meltzer asserted. ``Never has been. Never will be.''
   Drexel said it spent $75 million on legal fees associated with
its criminal and civil troubles last year, when it pleaded guilty
to six felonies and paid $500 million of $650 million owed in
government penalties. A mountain of litigation spawned by Drexel's
behavior still is outstanding.
   The government's investigation made Drexel a legal cottage
industry, and its collapse leaves bills scattered from coast to
coast. Lawyers for current and former employees said they expect to
press for some of the millions owed; at least one major New York
firm has its bankruptcy lawyer examining the issue.
   ``Everybody would like to be paid,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, who
represents Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel junk bond trader who has
been convicted of securities fraud and was indicted along with
Milken. ``I don't know whether we will or won't.''
   With Drexel busy disposing of billions of dollars in securities
holdings and addressing the thorny matter of having paid $260
million in bonuses as its financial fortunes sank, paying more
money to lawyers hasn't been a priority.
   ``They're pretty busy. I haven't been able to get through,''
said Daniel Bookin, a San Francisco attorney for Lisa Jones, a
former Drexel bond trading assistant who is appealing her
conviction for lying to a federal grand jury.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said backed-up legal bills
``will be dealt with in due course'' but he didn't know how much
was owed. Anreder said Drexel had for the time stopped paying for
individuals' new legal expenses.
   Drexel reportedly owes Milken attorneys _ mostly at the New York
firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison _ back pay for three
or four months, consistent with what other firms representing
Drexel people claim is due.
   The firm capped spending by Milken's criminal defense team last
summer, after it had rung up gargantuan legal bills to pay for two
full-time lawyers who reportedly bill out at $450 an hour and a
football team worth of associates.
   Drexel also anted up for Milken's defense against civil lawsuits
claiming his actions as head of Drexel's high-yield bond division
defrauded investors.
   The arrangement was unusual to begin with: Drexel paying to
defend the man who allegedly masterminded the crimes to which the
firm admitted. A spokesman for Milken said the indicted financier
would foot his own expenses from now on.
   For Milken, who made $550 million in 1987, that won't be a
problem. Other clients, such as Lisa Jones, depended on Drexel to
pay the bills. But Bookin, her attorney, said his firm ``will not
abandon Lisa Jones.''
   No attorneys have as yet filed claims against the firm or its
parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., which filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection on Feb. 13, seeking to get the back pay.
   The dismantling of Drexel also has created legal complications
for civil claimants who say they were defrauded by Drexel trading
in the past, and that means more work for lawyers.
   Drexel's liquidation doesn't absolve the firm from civil
wrongdoing, and lawyers said they will seek to recover assets from
the firm if their claims are upheld. They also said they will try
to find out whether Drexel wrongfully drained away assets,
including the 1989 bonuses.
   ``They still have all their legal liabilities and are not
protected by a bankruptcy case,'' said Dan Mogan, a San Diego
attorney representing shareholders of companies with which Drexel
had dealings.

<HEAD>Unions, LTV Reach Tentative Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>

   Negotiators for the United Steelworkers of
America and LTV Steel have reached a tentative labor agreement that
could avert a strike, officials said.
   Union spokesman Gary Hubbard said the agreement, approved early
Sunday by union negotiators, also must be approved by the union's
International Executive Board, by almost 13,000 steelworkers
employed by LTV and by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
   Parent LTV Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
July 1986, listing $6 billion in assets, making it one of the
country's biggest industrial bankruptcies.
   Terms of the agreement, which was agreed to take effect Sunday,
were not released.
   In a statement, the union said it expected the executive board
to act quickly on the pact but did not say when the board would
meet.
   ``The new labor agreement is competitive with recent settlements
between the Steelworkers and other domestic steelmakers,'' said
David H. Hoag, LTV Steel's president and chief executive officer.
``However, it has several unique features, including the
establishment of a joint customer satisfaction initiative that will
involve the entire LTV Steel work force in our effort to
continuously improve our quality and customer service.''
   Steelworkers employed at 13 LTV locations will vote by mail via
secret ballot, the union said. The vote will not take place until
the agreement is considered by Burton Lifland, the bankruptcy judge
who is supervising LTV's reorganization.
   LTV produces engineered flat rolled and tubular steel products
and is a wholly owned subsidiary of LTV Corp., a manufacturing
company also involved in aerospace, defense and energy products.
