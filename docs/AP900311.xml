   Danny Bonaduce, who played the
red-headed, wise-cracking Danny on television's ``Partridge
Family,'' has been arrested on a charge of buying crack in a
housing project, police said Saturday.
   Bonaduce, 30, a disc jockey at WEGX-FM in Philadelphia since
late 1988, was arrested early Friday by Daytona Beach police and
spent nearly 12 hours in jail before posting $5,000 bond,
dispatcher Claire Smith said.
   Ms. Smith said Bonaduce was observed by a member of the city's
street crime unit allegedly purchasing several crystals of crack, a
smokeable form of cocaine. She didn't know when Bonaduce was
scheduled to appear in court.
   Bonaduce played teen-ager Danny Partridge on the ABC series that
ran from 1970 to 1974. The show featured Shirley Jones as the head
of a family of six children who become a rock 'n' roll band.
   Telephone calls late Saturday to WEGX went unanswered.

   A dozen U.S. college students and two of their
advisers made it out of Haiti on Saturday, leaving behind 15
colleagues who had trouble traveling to the nation's capital to
catch the airplane.
   The group from Geneva College arrived about 8 p.m. at Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport. Those left behind were in a
remote section of western Haiti, but they weren't in danger,
officials said.
   Sam Siple, an aide to U.S. Rep. Joe P. Kolter, D-Pa., said the
12 students and two advisers left in Haiti couldn't make it to
airport in the capital city of Port-au-Prince from Kuichard, about
120 miles to the west.
   The only road to the capital was blocked by burning tires in a
popular uprising that brought on Saturday's resignation of Haitian
ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Siple said.
   ``There's no threat to any American civilians at this time,''
Siple said.
   The group from the Beaver Falls college went to different parts
of Haiti to do missionary work, said James Boelkins, the school's
vice president for academic affairs.
   ``None of them have been in danger at any time,'' Boelkins said
Saturday.
   Kolter and school officials worked later Saturday on arranging a
charter flight to get the rest of the Geneva contingent out by
Monday.

   Five black people going home from a movie were
attacked Saturday by at least 20 white people yelling racial slurs,
police said.
   Two black men and three black women were pelted with bottles,
beer cans and mud as they drove in a car through a predominately
white neighborhood about 1 a.m., Officer Simeon Frost said.
   The driver had to pull over, and three white men forced the
black men to the ground and began to beat them, Frost said. The
victims and witnesses reported the whites yelled racial insults and
told the blacks to stay out of the neighborhood, Frost said.
   One victim said about 20 more whites left a party nearby and
joined in the attack, spraying the black women with beer, police
said.
   The two black men, ages 18 and 19, suffered minor injuries in
the attack, police said. The three black women, ages 17 to 20, were
uninjured. All the victims were from Chicago.
   Police said the neighborhood where the attack occurred is about
75 percent white.
   There were no arrests.

   Jackson Martindell, the former
publisher of Who's Who in America, died Wednesday of cancer. He was
89.
   Martindell, who was born in Amarillo, Texas, by 1932 had founded
Fiduciary Counsel Inc., which advised prominent business families.
Over the next two decades, he made a reputation as a banker,
financier, consultant and economic adviser.
   After World War II, Martindell worked as a U.S. government
volunteer to help the Yugoslavian government re-establish that
nation's economy.
   In 1948 he married Anne Clark, who later became a New Jersey
state senator and U.S. ambassador to New Zealand.
   In 1956, Martindell became publisher of Marquis' Who's Who of
Chicago, which published the annual Who's Who in America. He sold
the publication to ITT in 1969 for a sum he described as
``fantastic'' and retired.

   Smoke from an overheated air conditioner
spewed into the cabin of a USAir jetliner Saturday, and the 116
passengers were evacuated down emergency chutes after the plane
landed, an airline spokesman said.
   No one was injured in the evacuation of the Boeing 737 at
Baltimore-Washington Airport, said USAir spokesman David Shipley.
   The flight from Phoenix to Baltimore landed at 9:23 p.m.
   The crew first had problems when pilot was preparing to land and
cockpit instruments failed to indicate the landing gear was in
place, Shipley said. The pilot flew by the airport tower and also
did backup checks and determined the malfunction was in the
monitoring equipment, Shipley said.
   The smoking air conditioner apparently was unrelated to the
first problem, Shipley said.

<HEAD>Said To Be Tired, Mandela Gives Short Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela was described as ``very
tired'' on Saturday and gave his shortest speech so far in a
three-week tour of African nations that have supported his cause
for an end to white rule in South Africa.
   Mandela, 71, the black nationalist leader released from a South
African prison last month, spoke for two minutes and 45 seconds in
this provincial capital about 125 miles west of Dar es Salaam, the
capital.
   ``He is very tired and the program ends here,'' said a Tanzanian
official who would only identify himself as a representative of the
prime minister's office.
   Morogoro is home to about 2,500 black refugees from South Africa
and contains a school and training farm run by the African National
Congress. Mandela is deputy president of the ANC, which is fighting
to end white domination in South Africa.
   Mandela, his wife, Winnie, and a number of other ANC leaders
arrived in Morogoro in the afternoon, five hours behind schedule.
They had come from Iringa, about 155 miles to the southwest.
   Reporters were not allowed to accompany Mandela and his party to
Iringa, which houses at least five military training camps for ANC
guerrillas.
   In his remarks to the refugees at Morogoro, Mandela once again
thanked Tanzania for its support of black South Africans.
   Mandela's tour so far has taken him to Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Tanzania and Ethiopia. He is scheduled to speak to the Liberation
Committee of the Organization of African Unity in Dar es Salaam on
Sunday, then fly to Sweden.
   Mandela was jailed 27 years on charges of plotting against the
South African government. He was freed Feb. 11.

<TEXT>
   About 150,000 supporters of statehood
knocked down a cardboard ``Wall of Colonialism'' and carried small
U.S. flags with 51 stars Saturday, the second day of congressional
hearings on the issue.
   Puerto Rican political and professional leaders told the
visiting U.S. congressional panel that the hearings about next
year's proposed plebiscite on the island's future status were
confusing and undefined.
   Jose Alberto Morales, president of the University of Sacred
Heart, told the panel Puerto Ricans need to know what the hearings
will achieve and what to expect from Congress after the
consultation process has taken place.
   In one of the largest pro-statehood demonstrations ever on the
island, marchers erected a huge cardboard wall inside the
University of Puerto Rico in the Ponce campus. Calling it the
``Wall of Colonialism,'' the marchers knocked it down with their
hands.
   They said ending Puerto Rico's commonwealth relationship, in
which Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but can't vote for president,
and making the island the 51st state would end the vestiges of U.S.
colonialism in this hemisphere.
   The eight-member congressional delegation will wind up Monday in
the city of Mayaguez on the proposed June 1991 plebiscite. The
hearings are led by the House Interior's Insular and International
Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Virgin Islands congressional
delegate, Ron de Lugo.
   In the plebiscite, voters would choose whether Puerto Rico, a
U.S. commonwealth, will become the 51st state, become independent
or have an ``enhanced'' form of commonwealth that would give it
more autonomy.
   The Caribbean island, now home to 3.3 million people, was ceded
to the United States by Spain in 1898 after the Spanish-American
War.

   Diplomatic sources and a human rights
activist said the government on Sunday executed six men convicted
of taking part in a failed coup attempt 25 years ago.
   No government officials were immediately available to confirm or
deny that the long-delayed death sentences were carried out despite
protests by European countries and human rights groups.
   The six were executed by firing squad, said lawyer Johannes C.
Princen, director of the Institute for the Defense of Human Rights.
   ``According to reliable sources who are always in touch with
political prisoners, the six were executed at 5:30 this morning.
They were taken out of the Cipinang Prison last Monday,'' Princen
told The Associated Press.
   Western diplomatic sources, who declined to be further
identified, confirmed the executions. Four former palace guards
convicted in the failed putsch were put to death in mid-February.
   Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Try Sutrisno told reporters
Saturday that the executions of the six had ``to wait for the right
time.'' They were an internal matter to be settled by Indonesia and
outsiders had no right to meddle, Sutrisno said.
   In explaining the long delay in carrying out death sentence,
Indonesian officials earlier said those marked for the firing squad
still had information of value to impart.
   The six reported executed were identified as Ruslan
Widjayasastra, 70, Sukatno, 60, Iskandar Subekti, 67, Asep
Suryaman, 62, I. Bungkus, 61, and Marsudi 53.
   They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government of
the late President Sukarno. Six army generals were killed in the
Sept. 30, 1965 uprising which was blamed on the Indonesian
Communist Party. The coup was crushed within days by troops loyal
to then-Maj. Gen. Suharto, now president of Indonesia.
   If the executions took place as reported, it was 24 years to the
day since Sukarno issued a letter of authority to Suharto to
restore law and order in the strife-torn country.
   The executions were protested last week by Princen's
organization, London-based Amnesty International, the 12-nation
European Community and the Netherlands.
   Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers on Friday offered political asylum in
the Netherlands for the six. The Netherlands froze a $12.5 million
aid package to its former colony after the February executions, but
a $90 million assistance program is continuing.
   Indonesia, once the Dutch East Indies, gained independence in
1949 after four years of fighting.

   Striking teachers voted Saturday on a
proposal to return to their classrooms so that negotiators can try
again to settle a pay dispute that led to their 3-day-old walkout.
   Voting teachers appeared to favor the proposal, said Kayetta
Meadows, president of the larger of two unions representing the
striking teachers.
   But late Saturday, Meadows accused Gov. Gaston Caperton of
reneging on an alleged promise to call a special legislative
session to address teacher pay, and she said, ``We have no choice
but to continue a statewide strike.''
   Caperton said Friday he would recommend that county school
boards refrain from docking teachers' pay and benefits for the days
they missed so far if they return to work Monday.
   Teachers from the 16,000-member West Virginia Education
Association and the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of
Teachers began voting on the proposal Saturday, and voting was
scheduled to continue in some counties Sunday.
   Union officials refused to release results Saturday.
   The federation leadership recommended that members vote for the
plan, calling it ``a fair and honorable way to end this strike.''
But the federation said teachers in some counties voted not to
accept it.
   Meadows said association members overwhelmingly voted to return
to work _ on condition there was no loss of pay or benefits,
negotiations would resume immediately and the special legislative
session was called.
   But Caperton said later in the day there would be no special
session, and Meadows declared, ``We are at an impasse.''
   Caperton spokesman G.C. Morse called Meadow's announcement
``very regrettable.''
   ``We did not commit ourselves or close the door to a special
session,'' he said. ``This is ludicrous.
   The strike began Wednesday after a 5 percent pay raise proposal
by the governor and legislative leaders collapsed.
   The WVEA says the average West Virginia teacher salary of
$21,904 ranks the state 49th in the nation, ahead of Mississippi.

   Two tour buses collided in a snowstorm
Saturday, seriously injuring a driver and sending 85 passengers to
hospitals, authorities said.
   The driver of one of the buses had his right leg amputated and
four passengers were admitted to hospitals, but most of the other
injuries appeared to be minor, California Highway Patrol and
hospital officials said.
   The accident occurred about 4 p.m. on Interstate 80 about a mile
east of here when a Reno Express bus from Hayward, Calif., lost
control in snow and an Ernie's Tours bus from Daly City, Calif.,
hit it head-on, said CHP dispatcher Dick Cunningham.
   He said two other vehicles were involved, but their occupants
escaped serious injury.
   ``It was pretty scary,'' said Danielle Burger of San Leandro,
Calif., a passenger on the bus that lost control. ``Everybody was
screaming and panicking. It happened so fast.
   ``All I remember is we started sliding and we went into a
360-degree turn when the other bus hit us. We were very lucky
because it could have been a lot worse.''
   Forty-three people were taken to Tahoe Forest Hospital here and
another 43 were taken to Washoe Medical Center in Reno. Officials
said late Saturday that three people were admitted in satisfactory
condition at the Truckee hospital; one was admitted in fair
condition at the Reno hospital with fractured ribs.
   A storm had dropped several inches of snow in the area before
the accident, and chains were required on the highway, Cunningham
said.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee met Sunday
to fix the agenda for an extraordinary session of the Soviet
Parliament, which is expected to annul the party's monopoly on
power and elect a vastly more powerful president.
   The meeting of the ruling party's policy-making body comes the
same day the Lithuanian parliament is expected to declare its
republic's independence from the Soviet Union.
   During the closed-door Central Committee meeting, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev could come under fire for Lithuania's
independence movement. The republic's Communist party already broke
with the national party in Moscow in December.
   The Central Committee convened at 10 a.m. in the Kremlin, the
official Tass news agency said in a brief dispatch. At the top of
its agenda were preparations for the session of the Congress of
People's Deputies, scheduled to convene Monday, Tass said.
   Officials reportedly will consider ending party control of the
management of almost every factory and institution in the country.
   In February, party leaders agreed to give up their monopoly on
power and compete in a multiparty system. But reformers say the
change will be ineffective unless the party also abolishes its
committees in plants, farms, army units, courts, police precincts
and elsewhere.
   Sunday's session will also consider a revamped set of party
rules, including the election of delegates to a party congress by
the rank and file. Previously, party leaders approved the
delegates, who in turn confirmed the leaders in a system that
preserved the status quo.
   The Congress meeting that opens Monday is expected to approve
the party's proposal for a more powerful presidency, despite
growing objections from reformers and outlying republics that the
plan would concentrate dictatorial power in Gorbachev's hands.
   The Soviet news service Interfax said the Central Committee will
return to its session to nominate its candidate for president after
the Congress passes the appropriate constitutional amendments.
Gorbachev is expected to be elected to the post, probably during
the coming week.

<TEXT>
   Israel's decision-making Inner Cabinet on
Sunday failed to reach agreement on U.S. peace proposals, and Vice
Premier Shimon Peres said his Labor Party will decide whether to
break up the government.
   Peres, who has vowed to end the coalition with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir unless there was progress in peace efforts, said on
Israel radio he viewed the lack of a decision as a rejection.
   He said he would leave it to the party, which is set to meet
Monday, to decide whether to stay in the government.
   ``It's the end of the (coalition) agreement, which could be the
only basis for maintaining the national unity government,'' Peres
said. ``We served notice that a lack of vote would be seen as a
decision and I see this as a negative decision.''
   The Cabinet debated proposals by U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III for holding talks in Cairo, Egypt, between Israeli and
Palestinian delegations.
   The Cairo talks would negotiate implementation of an Israeli
plan approved by the Cabinet last May 14 for holding elections in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Palestinian negotiators would be chosen in the balloting to talk
with Israel about an interim autonomy plan for the 1.7 million
residents of the occupied territories.
   Baker sought to meet Palestinian demands that an exiled
Palestinian and a resident of east Jerusalem to be represented in
the initial Cairo talks.
   U.S. officials said the wording of Baker's plan allowed for
Palestinains who worked or had second homes in Jerusalem to be
included in the Palestinian negotiating team along with
Palestinians who had been deported for anti-Israeli activities.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc objected, saying this would give
symbolic concessions to Palestinian demands that Israel relinquish
control of the Arab sector of Jerusalem and recognize the right of
return for three million Palestinians living abroad.

   The military denied Sunday that the
government had executed six men who took part in a Communist coup
attempt 25 years ago.
   Diplomatic sources and a human rights activist had said earlier
Sunday that the six were executed at dawn, despite appeals on their
behalf from Amnesty International and the European Community.
   But when a military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Nurhadi Purwosaputro,
denied the report, the sources checked with the prison and issued
another statement saying their initial report had been mistaken.
   Nurhadi said the attorney general alone has the authority to
announce when executions are carried out and that he had not done
so.
   Nurhadi confirmed the six men had been removed from the prison,
but there was no immediate word on where they were taken or why. He
refused to elaborate.
   The six were identified as Ruslan Widjayasastra, 70, Sukatno,
60, Iskandar Subekti, 67, Asep Suryaman, 62, I. Bungkus, 61, and
Marsudi, 53.
   Ruslan, Sukatno and Iskandar were ranking Communist officials,
while Marsudi was a sergeant major in the air force.
   They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government of
the late President Sukarno. Six army generals were killed in the

   The second of two sons charged with killing
their millionaire parents at the family's Beverly Hills mansion
last year surrendered to authorities early Sunday, police said.
   Erik Menendez, 19, surrendered to detectives as he stepped off a
plane at Los Angeles International Airport, said Beverly Hills
Officer Michael Dillard.
   Menendez reportedly had been playing in a tennis tournament in
Israel. Dillard said he did not know where the plane was from and
did not have any details of the arrest, which occurred shortly
after 1 a.m.
   Family members had said over the weekend that Erik Menendez
would turn himself in to authorities upon his return to the Los
Angeles area.
   His brother, Lyle, 22, was arrested Thursday and was being held
without bail pending arraignment on Monday.
   The brothers are charged with murdering their parents, Jose
Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise ``Kitty'' Menendez, 44, who were shot
to death Aug. 20 in their $5 million mansion. The sons reported
finding the bodies upon returning from a night on the town.
   The young men are heirs to the $14 million estate of Jose
Menendez, a successful executive of a Hollywood video distribution
company, Live Entertainment Inc. of Los Angeles.
   Police have said two killers committed the crime, then picked up
ejected shell casings from the .12-gauge shotguns they used before
fleeing the scene.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that a friend of Lyle
Menendez found a spent .12-gauge casing in one of the young man's
jackets.
   Police who served search warrants at a psychologist's office
Thursday also have obtained tape recordings, apparently of
counseling sessions, which likely will be the subject of a court
hearing for their admissibility.

<HEAD>Lithuania Elects First Non-Communist President of a Soviet
Republic</HEAD>

   Lithuania on Sunday became the first
Soviet republic to elect a non-Communistpresident. The move was the
latest in the Baltic republic's drive to secede from the Soviet
Union.
   Lithuanian lawmakers chose Vytautas Landsbergis by a wide margin
over Algirdas Brazauskas in the election for the presidency,
officially known as the chairmanship of the Presidium of the
Lithuanian Supreme Soviet.
   Landsbergis, a professor of music, is the leader of the Sajudis
grassroots movement that has spearheaded Lithuania's independence
drive.
   Brazauskas had already begun talks on secession with the
Kremlin, but Sajudis felt it would not be fitting to have a
Communist president since the Communists lost their majority in the
legislature.
   Brazauskas also advocated a more gradual approach to secession,
whereas Landsbergis wants independence proclaimed immediately.
   Landsbergis' victory came after deputies grilled him on how he
would oversee Lithuania's transition to independence.
   The vote on secession was expected later Sunday, and deputies
said there was little doubt the motion to resurrect Lithuania's
1918 declaration of statehood would pass.
   Deputies applauded as results were announced showing Landsbergis
had won the Lithuanian presidency. He received 91 votes, with 42
against. Brazauskas got 38 votes, with 95 against.
   Earlier this month, Sajudis-backed candidates won a two-thirds
majority in the first contested elections to Lithuania's 141-seat
Supreme Soviet, leaving the Communists in the minority.
   A vote later Sunday to restore Lithuania's indepedence would
present Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with his greatest
crisis in five years in power. Lithuania, like the other
independence-minded Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, was
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 while under Red Army
occupation. The parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first
passed on Feb. 16, 1918, declaring the state independent.
   Lawmakers already have declared illegal Lithuania's
incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 under a secret
Nazi-Soviet pact.
   Lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution
that was swept away by Josef Stalin's Kremlin in favor of a
Soviet-style law.
   Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have indicated the Kremlin
may grudgingly accept Lithuanian secession, at a steep price.
   Specifically, Gorbachev suggested a bill of $34 billion in hard
currency in compensation for factories and other infrastructure
built during a half-century of Soviet rule. Lithuanians replied
that their bill to the Soviet Union for decades of repression would
be higher.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of Washington insiders armed with
top-secret security clearances is conducting a major, unannounced
review of the nation's espionage laws in a search for better ways
to catch and convict spies.
   Recruited from the private sector by the leaders of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, the panel members have visited the CIA,
FBI, Pentagon and National Security Agency, among others, over the
last nine months.
   CIA Director William Webster, FBI Director William Sessions and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh all have met with members of the
group, according to executive branch sources.
   FBI and CIA spokesmen confirm their agencies have offered
information and suggestions, but won't describe them. A Justice
source says the department has yet to offer either formal or
informal advice.
   The panel _ which includes former White House, CIA, State and
Justice officials and a politically connected baseball team owner _
is working for Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and William Cohen,
R-Maine, chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the
Intelligence Committee.
   Many of the panel members already had security clearances from
service in past administrations. But sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity, said others received new or updated
clearances especially for this project.
   ``We had to get some fingerprints,'' an intelligence community
source said.
   Cohen said in an interview last week that he and Boren were
motivated by ``the decade of the spy and a long series of
counterintelligence failures, like Whitworth, the Walkers, Ed
Howard, Clyde Lee Conrad _ a string of people who have sold (or
been suspected of selling) highly classified information costing us
billions of dollars in technology that has been compromised, not to
mention some of our human intelligence compromised.''
   ``We want to enhance security measures without turning into a
Stalinist paranoid state,'' Cohen added.
   Senate sources said the panel has no chairman, but executive
branch officials said Boren's friend, Eli Jacobs, who owns the
Baltimore Orioles baseball team, has usually taken the lead.
Jacobs, a venture capitalist, served on an arms control advisory
group in the Reagan administration, still sits on Defense
Department advisory committees and may once have worked for Army
counterintelligence. He declined to be interviewed.
   The others have far more Washington experience. They are: former
deputy CIA Director and National Security Agency chief Bobby Ray
Inman; former CIA Director Richard Helms; former Carter White House
counsel Lloyd Cutler; former Reagan White House counsel Arthur B.
Culvahouse Jr.; former ambassador and senior State Department
official Seymour Weiss; former Xerox executive, ambassador and
Middle East negotiator Sol Linowitz; and former Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
   Columbia University Law Professor Harold Edgar, an expert on the
application of espionage statutes to leaked government information,
is helping write proposals in legislative language.
   In interviews, Cohen and Inman said greed has emerged as the
most common motivation for spies over the last decade. Ideology,
they said, had declined among spies even before it came unraveled
in the communist world during the last year.
   To counter that, one source said, the FBI has mentioned its
longstanding desire to be able to examine tax and consumer credit
records in intelligence investigations before there's full evidence
of a crime _ authority it now has only for bank records.
   ``If a guy goes from a Vega to a Jaguar in a year's time,
something's wrong,'' Cohen said.
   Inman refused to discuss the work of the panel, but said he
personally has begun thinking about how to use data that are now
unavailable to counterintelligence officials. He suggested that a
computer could be given a list of people with access to secrets and
the IRS could then ``tell you if there was any significant change,
either a bankruptcy or a large gain.'' But he warned against
opening tax records merely for ``fishing'' expeditions.
   Inman also said polygraph tests might be shortened to focus
narrowly on contacts with foreign agents _ and then administered
randomly among those with the most sensitive jobs. He's also
weighing the idea of bounties for family members who report
turncoat relatives.
   But this is early thinking. Cohen said legislative proposals are
still about two months away.
   However, Boren and Cohen already have stolen an arrow from the
executive quiver by turning first to prominent private citizens for
advice _ a standard weapon of presidents to marshal political
support in advance.
   Cohen is frank to admit that. ``It's always resisted from the
executive branch whenever we start talking about changes, so you
have to have backup.''
   In the government, each spy arrest is at once a success for
those who caught the traitor, a failure for those who were fooled
in the first place. So too, the Boren-Cohen advisers have divided
the intelligence community.
   At the most cynical, one intelligence official pointed out that
the leadership of the Senate committee rotates regularly and said,
``this is an effort to produce a legislative monument to the tenure
of Boren and Cohen.''
   Another executive branch official, citing the record string of
spy convictions in the 1980s, said, ``Our big counterintelligence
problem is not new legislation, but new values in society so people
won't be so willing to sell out their country.''
   But an intelligence community official praised the panel for
tackling tough questions. And he added, ``When you consider who
they are and the demands on their time, I'm impressed by the amount
of time they put in.''
   Further, ``the philosophical range on the panel is broad. If
they can come up with some consensus maybe we can get some problems
looked at seriously without arousing civil liberties concerns.''

<HEAD>Polls Show One in Four Party Lawmakers Want Thatcher to Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one-quarter of Conservative Party
lawmakers surveyed believe Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher should
resign before the next election, according to polls published
Sunday in three newspapers.
   The surveys appeared in The Sunday Times of London, The
Independent on Sunday and The Mail on Sunday. They were the latest
signs of growing discontent with Mrs. Thatcher and her three-term
government.
   The Sunday Times said it questioned 100 Conservative members of
Parliament and that 10 said Mrs. Thatcher should resign now.
Eighteen believe she should step down just before the next
election, which must be held by mid-1992.
   The newspaper said 59 lawmakers responded that Mrs. Thatcher
should remain in office until after the election. The remaining 13
believe it is up to her to decide when to leave politics.
   Of the 650 members in the House of Commons, 374 belong to the
governing Conservative Party. All three newspapers said they
questioned lawmakers from all factions of the party.
   The polls capped a week of national protests against a new
system of taxation, under which each adult in a local district must
pay the same amount for municipal services. The new ``community
charge'' does not take into account a person's income, and
community charges vary widely depending on the level of services
offered in a local district.
   The protests turned violent at times and sent jitters through
the financial community. The result was a 2{-cent drop in the value
of the British pound and lower share prices on the London Stock
Exchange.
   Opposition to the tax, along with rising inflation and 15
percent mortgage interest rates, has helped put the opposition
Labor Party as much as 19 points ahead of the Conservatives in
recent opinion polls.
   The Independent said Mrs. Thatcher's grip on the party
leadership had weakened substantially since December, when only 10
percent of lawmakers voted against her in the annual leadership
review.
   Mrs. Thatcher defeated little-known legislator Sir Anthony Meyer
314-33 in the vote.
   The Independent said that of the 171 Conservative lawmakers it
sampled, 41 want Mrs. Thatcher to resign before the next election.
It said 13 felt that ``maybe'' she should step down, but 113 want
her to stay. Four did not respond.
   The Mail on Sunday approached 146 lawmakers and said 116
replied. Of those, 45 said Mrs. Thatcher should consider stepping
down before the next election and 71 said she should not.
   All three surveys found that former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine was the favorite to replace Mrs. Thatcher.
   The Mail on Sunday also reported that some lawmakers planned to
ask Heseltine to campaign for the party leadership.
   Heseltine denied the report. He repeated predictions that Mrs.
Thatcher will lead the party to victory in the next election.

<HEAD>Counting the Homeless, a Special Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of federal workers is about to try to
make thousands of nearly invisible people part of America.
   The occasion is the first census of the homeless.
   Often in sight _ if not always seen _ these people do not exist
for purposes of federal aid and representation unless they can be
counted.
   How many are there? Where do they live? What kind of help to
they need?
   To many of the homeless, though, being counted seems likely to
make little difference in their lives.
   ``I don't see nothing I stand to lose or gain,'' said Spencer
Cox, a homeless New Yorker. ``It's just useless. What's the point?''
   A homeless man in Stamford, Conn., echoed Cox's view. ``What
good would it do?'' to cooperate, said the man, who would identify
himself only as Bob.
   Estimates of the number of homeless nationwide have ranged from
250,000 to 3 million in recent years.
   Counting them _ a task some consider impossible _ will be
attempted on the night of March 20-21, less than two weeks before
the Census Bureau's official counting day for the rest of the
nation.
   ``It's the first time we've gone out in the street'' to count
people, said Cynthia M. Taeuber, who is directing the effort.
   Advocates for the homeless, local governments and other
organizations have been enlisted to help, and most are cooperating,
she said.
   In some cases that assistance is being given ``grudgingly,''
however, since the groups have concerns about whether there will be
a complete and accurate count.
   ``The Bush people are not into taking care of people who need
help,'' said Karl Kirman, contacted at the Columbus House shelter
in New Haven, Conn. ``And they don't want to know why we need
help.'' But Kirman said he would answer the census questions anyway.
   Simone Baxter, 29, of Hartford, Conn., who said she has been
homeless for four months, believes it is important to be counted.
   ``I don't think the government realizes how many homeless people
there are,'' she said.
   William Barrios, who lives in a shelter for veterans in New
York, said people in shelters will be cooperative. ``They get a
census every night when they check in,'' he said.
   ``The homeless people on the streets, they're not going to
cooperate. They're druggies and alcoholics looking for their next
fix,'' Barrios added.
   In Washington, Mitch Snyder of the Center for Creative
Non-Violence is urging the homeless to snub the Census Bureau.
   ``You can't count all the people in the streets. Experience
quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as such is to
risk harassment ... and abuse,'' Snyder said.
   In Detroit, Toylce Cheatham is worried about talking to
government officials, even though the Census Bureau promises to
keep the answers secret.
   ``They'll tell you it's confidential. But you can get cut off if
you say the wrong thing,'' said the 24-year-old Cheatham, who was
staying at the Salvation Army's Booth Center.
   And she wasn't convinced that getting the homeless counted would
result in more shelters or other aid anyway. ``That's what they're
been going to do. But they're been saying that for umpteen years.''
   In Chicago, officials of the Pacific Garden Mission said they
will aid census-takers. ``Whether they're aware of it or not,
they're being counted,'' said Boyd Sylvester, assistant
superintendent of the mission.
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' said Breon Lucas, 26. ``The
government can help people who don't have a job find a place to
work and give them something to eat at night.''
   Another Chicagoan, Anthony Kunevich, 60, was skeptical: ``They
think about the Army and give them raises. They don't think about
the poor people, the homeless.''
   Because of problems in finding all the homeless, and concerns
about worker safety, Taeuber admits that she expects the tally to
be conservative.
   A decade ago census takers went to shelters but did not try and
count people living in alleys, under bridges and in parks and
similar locations.
   In the end it won't announce any specific number of homeless,
since officials decline to try to define that term. Instead, the
bureau simply will report that its special count found so many
people in shelters, so many in missions, so many in flophouses, so
many walking or sleeping on the streets, and so forth.
   Beginning at 6 p.m. March 20, census workers will visit public
and private emergency shelters, hotels and motels used to shelter
the homeless and other hotels costing less than $12 per night. This
effort is expected to last until about midnight, covering a period
when people are generally settled for the night.
   Then, from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. census workers will travel the
streets, checking places not intended for habitation but where
homeless people may be found.
   Security can be a problem for workers taking to streets and
shelters in the middle of the night, and they will be dispatched in
groups of two or three. They have been told to leave any area where
problems develop, Taeuber said.
   Because of safety questions, she explained, the decision was
made not to enter abandoned buildings even though people may be
sleeping in them.
   And, she added, ``sleeping persons will not be awakened to
answer questions.'' Instead, ``enumerators will estimate as best
they can the person's age, sex and race.''
   The same goes, she said, ``for persons who are not in a state of
mind to answer questions, or who refuse.''
   ``We will attempt to ask all persons in shelters and all persons
living on streets the basic'' questions, she said, but ``our main
effort will be just to get a person counted.''
   People living in shelters for abused women, in tents at
commercial campgrounds, seeking temporary shelter in local jails
and other such institutions will be counted in the regular census
on April 1.

<HEAD>House Panel Would Include Military in New Procurement Corps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon should establish an acquisition
corps in each of the services to handle its purchases of more than
$100 billion in weapons each year, a House subcommittee said Sunday.
   ``The words `procurement disaster' comes to our lips far too
often,'' Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, chairman of Armed Services
subcommittee on investigations, said in unveiling draft legislation
to change the military's buying practices.
   The bill envisions an acquisition corps consisting of both
military and civilian personnel overseen by the under secretary of
defense for acquisition, commonly known as the Pentagon's
procurement czar.
   It also proposes the creation of a Defense Acquisition
Management University to conduct research and train a professional
procurement corps.
   The subcommittee said it had found that half of the people who
work in Pentagon contracting lack a college education.
   ``We are dissatisfied with the current acquisition system and
committed to developing a more professional acquisition
workforce,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins of Kentucky, the ranking
Republican on the panel.
   Mavroules, D-Mass, rejected as a ``non-starter'' recent
suggestions that a new acquisition agency separate from the
military services be created.
   ``Talk of such radical changes simply stymies efforts to achieve
real change,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ritual slayings of 15 people,
including a Texas college student who disappeared a year ago during
spring break, have led to books, speeches and warnings, but no
verdicts yet.
   University of Texas student Mark Kilroy vanished early March 14,
1989, while out bar hopping with three friends in this border city.
After a monthlong search, his mutilated corpse was found buried at
a ranch.
   Fourteen other victims were unearthed there and at a nearby
farm. A drug-smuggling cult allegedly performed the ritual slayings
seeking magical protection from the law and rival smugglers.
   Here's what those involved have to say a year later:
   _ Helen and James Kilroy of Santa Fe, Texas, say some good has
come from the death of their 21-year-old son: They have been
warning other young people about the evils of drugs through
speaking engagements and the Mark Kilroy Foundation.
   They also are writing a book. The parents said they haven't read
the books already published, including one titled ``Hell Ranch,''
but have heard they sensationalized the killing.
   ``In our book we intend to tell the true story, and exactly what
all went on, how we felt about it all,'' said James Kilroy.
   _ Bill Huddleston, a Texas A&amp;M junior who accompanied Kilroy to
Matamoros, called a news conference Wednesday to urge college
students who go out drinking to stay together and check up on each
other. ``I feel like I owe it to Mark to get the message out to
everyone,'' Huddleston said.
   He said he'll be skiing in New Mexico this spring break. For
those who go across the border, he recommended participation in a
voluntary sign-in program Mexican officials have begun.
   _ Five men arrested in April remain jailed in Matamoros,
awaiting verdicts from a state district judge.
   Three others, including alleged cult ``godmother'' Sara Maria
Aldrete Villarreal, were jailed in June after a shoot-out with
police in Mexico City. Mexican officials in January reported that
one of the three, Omar Orea Ochoa, died of complications from AIDS.
   Cult ``godfather'' Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo reportedly ordered
himself and follower Martin Quintana Rodriguez killed as police
closed in on the Mexico City apartment.
   _ State District Judge Francisco Salvador Perez said the fact
that two of the suspects are in Mexico City has slowed paperwork
and he could not say when he will reach verdicts. Under Mexican
law, he said the defendants in this case are presumed responsible,
but have the opportunity to prove themselves innocent.
   Perez said the greatest punishment any single defendant in the
case could receive would be 40 years in prison, the penalty for
homicide, the worst crime alleged. One of the seven, a caretaker at
the ranch, is charged only with covering up the crime.
   _ Alex Perez, sheriff in Brownsville just across the Rio Grande,
says the gruesome crime still haunts him. ``In my life, I've seen a
lot of it, but this was the one that got me not to sleeping at
night,'' he said.
   Experts concluded that the cult practiced a perverted form of
the Afro-Cuban religion Palo Mayombe, in which believers use human
bones, but don't normally kill people to get them. Police said
Constanzo's cult reported inspiration from the 1987 film ``The
Believers.''

   Chase Untermeyer says that being George Bush's
chief talent scout is ``rather like painting the Golden Gate
Bridge.''
   ``Once you finish the job, you have to start in at the other end
and start painting it again,'' says the 44-year-old White House
personnel director and Bush protege.
   From a crowded office in the West Wing of the White House,
Untermeyer and his staff assemble resumes and sort out the winners
from the also-rans in the quest for presidential appointments.
   With White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, the affable
Houston-raised and Harvard-trained Untermeyer makes the final
recommendations to Bush on 3,500 jobs. Untermayer and his staff
also ride herd on Cabinet and agency heads in filling more than
2,000 other political posts.
   Untermeyer, once a political reporter, said in a recent
interview that ``it's sort of a rule of thumb in this business
(that) every time you make an appointment you earn nine enemies and
one ingrate.''
   There also has been some criticism of the speed with which the
White House has filled appointments. Last September, Democrats on
Capitol Hill accused Bush of operating ``a Swiss-cheese
govermnent'' riddled with high-level vacancies.
   Untermeyer defends the administration's performance, saying that
background checks are time-consuming and that the criticism would
have been far worse ``if we had slam-dunked people into jobs.''
   ``I personally don't mind being the target of a bad news story
or two in 1989 if we are spared in 1990 and thereafter a series of
news stories about some cretin or boob or otherwise incompetent
individual who was named to office by George Bush,'' he told the
Heritage Foundation last year.
   ``You can bet that the folks writing those stories would not
say, `On the other hand, the White House in 1989 acted with
admirable speed in putting this fine citizen into office,''' said
Untermeyer.
   In the interview, Untermeyer said the opposition turned up the
heat on the pace of appointments ``essentially because we had
denied the Democrats ... the so-called sleaze issue.''
   ``Practically none of our nominees has come under any
controversy, whereas that happened all the time under President
Reagan.''
   However, several Bush nominees to major posts were defeated or
forced to withdraw, including John Tower as defense secretary and
William Lucas as the Justice Department's civil rights chief.
   In addition, Fred Bush, the chief fund-raiser for the 1988 Bush
campaign but no relation to the president, was rejected as
ambassador to Luxembourg after coming under scrutiny for contracts
he had received from Reagan's Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Untermeyer served as a Navy officer during the Vietnam war.
After a stint with the Houston Chronicle, he entered politics and
served two terms in the Texas House of Representatives. He became
executive assistant to then-Vice President Bush at the outset of
the Reagan administration.
   Later, he spent five years in the Pentagon as a deputy and then
assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserves,
responsible for recruiting, training, health and other matters for
the Navy's 600,000 sailors and 200,000 Marines.
   Untermeyer, who said he longs to leave personnel work and
``return to a policy rule,'' has stayed off the social circuit,
partly to avoid being button-holed by job seekers.
   He routinely logs 12- to 14-hour days, customarily getting by on
four or five hours of sleep a night.
   At his desk on a recent Sunday afternoon, Untermeyer
acknowledged that 1989 had ``its grim points, but it had its
upside, too. I also met the woman that I'm now engaged to marry.''
   He and Diana C. Kendrick, 27, executive assistant to C. Boyden
Gray, the White House counsel, plan an October wedding.
   ``It was a White House romance. You might say that we met on a
Sunday working on paperwork _ which is exactly what's happening
now.''

   The theme at the Metropolitan Opera was the past
and Golden Anniversary nostalgia, but the accent was on youth and
the future.
   In place of its usual Saturday matinee opera, the Met threw a
gala concert featuring some of its shining _ and rising _ stars in
arias, duets, trios, even a quintet.
   The occasion was the 50th year of continuous Met radio
broadcasts sponsored by Texaco, and the concert was heard by the
faithful audience of millions that tunes in each week during the
season.
   What they heard were mostly familiar operatic excerpts made
special by some exceptional young American singers.
   Chief among those was Dawn Upshaw, the soprano who has been
staking a claim to many of the roles identified with Kathleen
Battle. Miss Upshaw was radiant in an aria from Stravinsky's rarely
heard masterpiece ``The Rake's Progress.''
   Another highlight was a pair of performances by baritone Thomas
Hampson. He rattled off a dazzling rendition of ``Largo al
factotum,'' from Rossini's ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and later
showed potential for heavier roles as he joined soprano Carol
Vaness in the Act Two duet from Verdi's ``La Traviata.''
   Miss Vaness was good in that, but she was downright awesome a
short while in the tricky ``Come scoglio,'' the first-act
showstopper from Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte.'' Runs, trills, leaps _
all were letter-perfect.
   Others who made favorable impressions included recent debutantes
Delores Ziegler, in the composer's aria from Strauss' ``Ariadne auf
Naxos,'' and Ashley Putnam, whose ringing high C's stood out in the
final trio from Gounod's ``Faust.'' There she was joined by
Francisco Araiza and Samuel Ramey.
   Ramey _ who also sounded splendid in an aria from Verdi's
``Ernani'' _ was one of the few superstars on hand for the
afternoon. Bass James Morris chimed in with a thoughtfully sung
aria from Verdi's ``Don Carlos,'' and tenor Neil Shicoff sobbed his
way affectingly through the third-act aria from Puccini's
``Tosca.'' The great German bass Kurl Moll was sort of wasted in a
brief scene from Wagner's ``Der Fliegende Hollaender.''
   The most entertaining number of the day was the quintet from
Rossini's ``Il Barbiere,'' nicely sung and acted by Miss Ziegler,
Araiza, Gino Quilico, Renato Capecchi and Ferruccio Furlanetto.
   The concert opened with artistic director James Levine
conducting the overture to Mozart's ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' the
first opera ever broadcast by Texaco, in 1940.
   Original plans called for Marilyn Horne to appear, but she did
not. Another mezzo mainstay of the company, Tatiana Troyanos,
withdrew at the last minute because of illness.
   But, in the end, maybe the shortage of familiar star power was
all to the good. It threw the emphasis on the emerging generation
of singers on whom those Saturday afternoon broadcasts will depend
for years to come.

   Anheuser-Busch's trademark Clydesdales are
being moved to California as part of a cost-cutting program at the
world's largest brewery.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. announced Friday that it plans to move
its 24-year-old breeding center from suburban St. Louis to a
900-acre facility in Warm Springs, Calif., where the animals will
have more room to roam.
   The huge draft horses, which have pulled the Budweiser beer
wagon since 1933, make about 500 promotional appearances around the
country each year. There are 74 horses in the company's herd.
   ``It makes economic sense to manage our breeding and stock
management operations at a larger, more rural site,'' said Michael
Roarty, Anheuser-Busch's director of marketing.
   The current breeding center at Grant's Farm, the estate of the
late August Busch Jr., grandson of the brewery's founder, is only
75 acres.
   As part of the move, the breeding herd, which provides less than
half of the company's Clydesdales, will be cut in half, Roarty said.
   Visitors still will be able to see Clydesdales at Grant's Farm
and at the brewery's stable in St. Louis, he said.
   August Busch Jr. started the Clydesdales in 1933 as a present to
his father to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition.

<TEXT>
   The Italian Communist Party, the largest
in the West, voted Sunday to embark on a new course that is
expected to lead to a change in its name and the dropping of the
hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   Party leader Achille Occhetto was re-elected at the
extraordinary congress and will preside over the changes. The next
party congress, which may not be convened for a year, is expected
to approve the details of the Communists' new line.
   Occhetto had campaigned hard for relaunching the Italian
Communist Party, which is the second-biggest political grouping in
Italy. It has an estimated 1.4 million members.
   After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Occhetto
argued that Italy's Communists could not ignore the march of
history.
   A new political formation could reverse the decline in party
membership and the steady slip in electoral strength, he said.
   If the new party moves closer to the mainstream of European
socialism, Occhetto has argued, it could help unite Italy's
political left and forge a viable alternative to the Christian
Democrats.
   The Christian Democrats and their allies have dominated every
Italian government since the end of World War II.
   Occhetto supports the Communist Party becoming a new grouping of
leftist forces representing the workers, the poor, the weak and the
disenfranchised. His motion to eventually change the party's name
and symbol was supported by 726 delegates in balloting Sunday. That
represented 67 percent of the ballots.
   A motion to reject major reforms received just 37 votes, or 3
percent.
   Central Committee members elected Sunday morning met for the
first time and re-elected Occhetto as party secretary. The vote was
213 in favor and 23 against, with 71 abstaining and five blank
ballots.
   The Communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34
percent of the vote, but they dropped to about 27 percent in the
last parliamentary elections in 1987.
   For many Communists in Bologna, Occhetto's proposals seemed to
be merely a formal recognition of how the party has already changed.
   The party has long proclaimed its independence from Moscow,
supporting Western parliamentary democracy and even Italy's
membership in NATO. It has seen itself as a critic of international
communism: it condemned the Soviet interventions in Czechoslovakia
in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979, and the bloody Chinese crackdown
on pro-democracy demonstrators last year.
   Still, Old Guard Communists rebelled against Occhetto's
proposal. They favored reform but fought against changes that would
mean a new name or elimination of the party symbols.
   The differences appeared to vanish Saturday when, after making
an impassioned plea for unity in his final address, a tearful
Occhetto was embraced on the platform by Pietro Ingrao, another
respected old lion of the party.
   Now Occhetto must design the shape and politics of the new
party. He has pledged that the party's new identity will be chosen
through a free and open debate and then presented to the next party
congress.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is giving up the
presidency but not his control of the 60,000-man army, the muscle
in his long authoritarian rule.
   If anything, he plans to keep flexing it.
   ``I was ready, and always will be, to take on the enemies of
liberty and of democracy,'' Pinochet said in his farewell speech to
the nation, delivered in dress military uniform Friday night.
   A 10-year-old constitution written by his government gives the
armed forces a powerful role as watchdogs over institutional order.
In speech after speech before stepping down, he promised to wield
that authority.
   From his new army commander's office, which is directly across
Santiago's main boulevard from the presidential palace, he will be
able to literally keep watch over the new leadership.
   Pinochet's constitution also bars any new president from
replacing him as commander for eight more years _ twice the term of
new President Patricio Aylwin, who took office Sunday.
   After winning election in December, Aylwin asked Pinochet to
retire from the army when the change in government took place. The
general refused.
   Aylwin contends that Pinochet has come to represent hate and
division among Chileans, and that his presence in any position of
power is an obstacle to national reconciliation. Pinochet told
Aylwin that, with him at the army's lead, Chile's political
transition is more secure.
   On Sunday, Aylwin said of Pinochet, ``I hope he will limit
himself to the functions of a chief commander, and will not try to
interfere with the political progress of the state.''
   But Pinochet frequently has indicated that he sees himself as
much more than just a military functionary. He has said that, on
matters of importance, he will not answer to the minister of
defense but deal only directly with Aylwin.
   The ranks of the army, by far the most powerful military branch,
are believed to be solidly behind Pinochet. Traditionally a
well-disciplined force, it has receieved unprecendented benefits
during his rule. These include higher pay, healthy pension
programs, good housing and more and better weapons and training.
   During his final weeks in power, Pinochet pushed through
legislation that trimmed Aylwin's authority and made the military
virtually autonomous.
   One law, which has the weight of a constitutional amendment,
bars the new government from cutting defense spending. It also
gives the armed forces the power to conduct any business, including
weapons purchases and sales, without presidential approval.
   The military's main concern at the moment is preventing trials
of officers for human rights violations that occurred after
Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup.
   Leftist parties and human rights activists are demanding
vigorous prosecution, but Pinochet has declared he won't stand for
it.
   Unlike many Latin American countries, where the end of military
rule was hastened by economic bungling and social upheaval, Chile's
armed forces are returning to the barracks intensely proud of their
administration. They leave a stable, productive ecomony with one of
Latin America's lowest inflation rates.
   On more than one occasion, Pinochet has predicted that Chile
some day will miss his law-and-order government.
   He also has cited the case of Cincinnatus, a Roman military
ruler who, after retiring to till the soil, was called back because
of growing disorder.

<HEAD>Amusement Parks Squabble Over `World's Tallest Roller Coaster'
Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Giant has taken on Hercules, but
the title of ``world's tallest wooden roller coaster'' may wind up
being settled in the courts instead of on the tracks.
   The Texas Giant ride had barely completed its test runs before
it drew threats of a lawsuit from an Allentown, Pa., amusement park
that claims it has the tallest wooden roller coaster.
   Whether the new attraction at Six Flags Over Texas or the
Hercules at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom has the right to the
title is a bit confusing. There is no certifying agency and no
universally correct way to measure a roller coaster.
   Texas Giant has the highest first hill, at 143 feet. Six Flags
officials measure the ride from the loading station to the top of
the first hill, or lift. Hercules sports a lift of only 100 feet.
   But the Allentown Park says the correct way to size up a roller
coaster is by the length of its vertical drop. Hercules riders wind
up 157 feet lower than the height to which they are towed. The
Texas Giant's vertical drop is 137 feet.
   Dorney Park spokesman Harry Schmerling said the park plans to
protest the Texas Giant's claim as being false and to defend
Hercules' reputation as being No. 1. He said attorneys representing
his park are continuing to ``actively study'' the legal aspects of
the roller coaster tussle.
   ``It's a major difference between being the world's tallest
wooden roller coaster and not being the world's tallest wooden
roller coaster,'' Schmerling said.
   The Arlington Convention and Visitors Bureau already is
circulating materials promoting the new attraction in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area as being the world's tallest. Sandy LaPlant
said her agency won't change those materials unless ordered to do
so by Six Flags management.
   At any rate, the new roller coaster is an eye-opener. Or an
eye-closer, for those who find their courage quickly waning as the
cars creep toward the summit.
   Randy Geisler, president of the American Coaster Enthusiasts
club in St. Paul, Minn., hasn't taken sides, but he does plan to
take a spot in line. His group plans to hold its annual convention
in Arlington in June, and more than 400 members are ready to test
the Texas Giant, tallest or not.

<HEAD>Report: Sperm Bank Faces Second Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sperm bank accused in an alleged racial
mix-up faces a separate lawsuit by a couple alleging it threw away
the sperm of a man about to undergo treatment for testicular
cancer, according to a published report.
   Idant Laboratories was sued by Gasper and Catherine Mastrobuoni
last year after the sperm was thrown out because of a billing
mix-up, the Daily News reported in its Sunday editions.
   ``I was devastated when I found out they destroyed my husband's
sperm,'' Mrs. Mastrobuoni told the News. ``It was our only chance
for having a child.''
   Idant is accused in another lawsuit filed last week of providing
the wrong semen to a white woman who later bore a black child. The
woman's husband, also white, had his sperm stored before undergoing
chemotherapy for cancer.
   Idant has denied fault in that case.
   The News said it was unable to reach company officials for
comment on the Mastrobuoni claim. A call placed by The Associated
Press to Idant's answering service Saturday night wasn't returned.
   When Matrobuoni's cancer was discovered, a Veterans
Administration hospital referred him to Idant, the News said. He
agreed to pay the bank $200 and it stored some of his semen in
January 1985, before he started radiation treatment.
   When the couple didn't hear from Idant, they called and learned
the husband's sperm had been discarded because the lab had only
received a $20 payment from the Veterans Administration.
   By that time, Mastrobuoni had started his radiation treatment.
   ``We never received any type of billing,'' Mrs. Mastrobuoni told
the News. The newspaper said it could not reach Veterans
Administration officials for comment.
   Mastrobuoni's cancer has been cured but an attorney for the
couple, Joseph Filardi, said ``it's very unlikely his sperm count
is high enough to effectuate conception.'' He added that radiation
treatments also adversely affected the sperm.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury is wrapping up an
investigation of a former state prosecutor's alleged drug use in a
case raising questions about a previous investigation by the state
attorney general.
   Richard Guida was a deputy attorney general until 1986, when he
resigned after a radio reporter's allegations that he was a heavy
cocaine user.
   Then-Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman found no evidence of
any wrongdoing, but Guida said staying on the job while fighting
what he called rumors would burden the department.
   The FBI and federal officials have been on the case since at
least last May, and the grand jury has been hearing secret
testimony from a string of Guida's acquaintances and former
girlfriends for at least seven months. Insiders say the jury could
wrap up its probe within a month.
   A recently obtained federal court document says last August
acting U.S. Attorney James West told the court the probe ``involves
allegations of possession and use of controlled substances'' by
Guida while a prosecutor.
   Guida denied the allegations, said he never used cocaine and as
recently as last month said he was not aware of any investigation.
The court document said Guida was told he was a target of the probe
last May.
   Guida was a highly regarded prosecutor whose role in winning
convictions in a highly publicized murder won him a consulting job
in a television miniseries about the case called ``Echoes in the
Darkness.'' The show portrayed him as a hard-nosed prosecutor.
   Sources familiar with the investigation, including a grand jury
witness, say it includes allegations that Guida provided cocaine to
friends and that other officials may have tried to cover up his
problems.
   The witness, Brenda Snell, would not discuss specifics of her
grand jury appearance. But in a recent interview, the
self-described former drug dealer and recovering addict said she
told the FBI she sold cocaine to Guida three times and purchased
small quantities of the drug from him twice.
   In 1985, she alleged, she sold a pound of cocaine to Guida for
$17,000. She claimed Guida gave her the money in $100 and $20 bills
in a paper bag at a snack shop in the building housing the attorney
general's office.
   At the time, Guida was chief of the prosecutions section,
supervising lawyers whose work included drug cases.
   Ms. Snell's attorney, Don Bailey, was present during the FBI
interviews and confirmed she provided the details to investigators.
Guida said he doesn't know the woman and called her allegations
``absolute lies.''
   An FBI spokesman would not comment.
   Other sources, including lawyers representing grand jury
witnesses, said the FBI became interested in Guida while
investigating drug dealer Jack Alan Hull.
   Hull, 33, of Hershey was convicted in state court last year of
cocaine and marijuana possession, subsequently pleaded guilty to
federal charges of cocaine distribution and appeared before the
grand jury earlier this year.
   In a sentencing memorandum signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Gordon Zubrod, the government said Hull was providing information
about his former drug contacts.
   ``Most of Jack Hull's clients were well-heeled professionals in
the Dauphin County area,'' Zubrod wrote. ``His list included
attorneys, physicians, stockbrokers and businessmen.''
   Guida was Hull's attorney until Hull pleaded guilty and decided
to cooperate. Guida said, ``He couldn't afford me any more.''
   Hull is in protective custody at a state prison and could not be
interviewed. But WHP-TV, quoting a source, reported that Hull
``alleges he was getting protection from Guida in the attorney
general's office.''
   Guida denied that allegation, too. Sources, who asked not to be
named because of the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings,
said federal officials obtained records from the attorney general's
office relating to Guida's tenure and the 1986 internal probe.
   Zimmerman, now a lawyer in private practice, said when Guida
left that the investigation by his office cleared the deputy. In a
recent interview, he recharacterized the outcome as finding no
evidence to support prosecution.
   West, who worked for Zimmerman and with Guida before moving to
the federal system, took himself off the case because of a
potential conflict of interest. Still, Ms. Snell's attorney Bailey
asked U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to withdraw West's nomination
as U.S. attorney.
   Bailey, a Democratic former state auditor general long at odds
with West politically, alleged that West and the FBI were covering
up for Guida.
   Specter asked FBI Director William S. Sessions to investigate
Bailey's allegations as part of a background check on West. The
check apparently turned up no incriminating information about West;
his file was sent to President Bush in January, clearing the way
for his nomination.

   A mild earthquake rumbled through a
lightly populated area near the capital Sunday. No damage or
injuries were reported.
   The quake, which measured 4 on the Richter scale, struck about
30 miles southeast of Algiers. It was the latest of several mild
quakes that have hit the Algiers area since Oct. 29, when a strong
temblor occurred.
   That quake left at least 26 people dead, damaged 50,000
dwellings, and caused extensive damage in the legendary Casbah of
old Algiers.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

   The headquarters of the 22-member Arab
League will return to Cairo, ending an 11-year stay in Tunisia
where it moved in protest after Egypt made peace with Israel.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid announced the
decision Sunday at a biannual Arab League session. Egypt's Middle
East News agency reported the announcement in a dispatch from
Tunis, the Tunisian capital.
   Abdel-Meguid said the move would take place in September.
   The offices of the Arab Organization for Education, Culture and
Science, and the Arab Broadcasting Union will remain in Tunis, the
agency said.
   The Arab League charter names the Egyptian capital as seat of
the organization, which was set up in Cairo in 1945. The 1979
decision to transfer the headquarters from Cairo was a sanction
against Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel. Egypt was
also suspended from the league.
   All Arab nations but Libya have officially restored diplomatic
ties with Cairo. Egypt's suspension was lifted in May.

   Police have arrested an Amnesty
International representative who was gathering information about
the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, sources
said Sunday.
   Ram Kumar Jivanmitra was arrested Friday after leaving the
Supreme Court building, according to the Human Rights Organization
of Nepal.
   Police found documents in Jivanmitra's pockets that detailed
arrests and allegations of torture by security forces, members of
the rights group said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was no official word on the reported arrest. The sources
said Jivanmitra was reporting information about the crackdown to
Amnesty International, a human rights group based in London.
   The government has arrested hundreds of people to quell a
movement launched by two banned political parties seeking a return
to a multiparty system.
   At least 12 people have been killed in confrontations between
demonstrators and police, according to the government. Activists
say the toll is about double the government figure.
   The two parties _ the Nepali Congress and a coalition of
left-wing groups _ are demanding an end to a 29-year-old ban on
political parties.
   Power in Nepal is shared by King Birendra and a non-partisan
Rashtriya Panchayat, or National Assembly. One-fifth of the
assembly's 140 members are nominated by the monarch, and the rest

   Students distributed
leaflets Sunday to protest what they called an anti-Islamic,
pro-Western educational policy at the nation's only university. It
was only the second protest reported in the country's two decades
since independence.
   The protesters said foreign teachers at United Arab Emirates
University in Al-Ain are encouraging Moslem women to abandon the
veil. Most teachers and professors at the university are foreigners.
   ``Foreign teachers are selling their Western lifestyle among
students regarding the relationship between men and women:
intermingling among sexes, giving up the Islamic veil and other
Western habits,'' the students said in their leaflet.
   The document was distributed along with the monthly magazine of
the university's student federation. The magazine is distributed
free to all government departments and companies.
   The university has 8,000 students, two-thirds of whom are women,
but there are no women on the board of the student federation. In
line with Islamic norms that govern society here, the men and women
are strictly segregated at the university.
   The protest was directed at the university's rector, Abdul-Hafez
al-Kurdi, an Egyptian-born naturalized American. It did not demand
his replacement but called for appointing qualified U.A.E.
nationals in leadership positions at the university.
   The student federation said a poll of students showed 65 percent
believed university standards were declining, and 53 percent blamed
Kurdi.
   The United Arab Emirates has a population of 1.6 million, of
which only one-third are nationals. The rest are foreign labor from
Asian, Arab and Western nations.
   Only one previous demonstration has been reported in the country
since 1971, when the seven former Trucial Coast sheikdoms under
British protection became the United Arab Emirates. That protest
was against a declaration by President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan that he planned to step down.

   The newspaper did not elaborate, but it appeared to be referring
to the English-language newspaper Tehran Times. That newspaper
recently called for the release of the 18 Westerners held by
pro-Iranian factions.
   Jomhuri Islami is aligned with the radical faction in Tehran
that opposes Rafsanjani's efforts to improve relations with Western
countries. Any contact with the United States is anathema to the
radicals.
   The newspaper referred to the recent revelation that President
Bush had spoken on the phone with a man who claimed to be
Rafsanjani, but really wasn't.
   ``Washington wants to insinuate ... that efforts are being made
behind the curtain for establishment of ties between Iran and the
United States,'' the newspaper wrote.
   ``The more the United States makes such endeavors, the less it
will gain,'' it said. ``Washington has not only failed to evaluate
the Islamic republic but has confirmed, in fact, that the Islamic
republic enjoys a sound and unshakable policy toward the United
States.''
   A parliament deputy called for an investigation Sunday into the
phone hoax.
   Mohammad Qomi, deputy from Veramin, said Rafsanjani should look
into the matter because it is unlikely anyone from Iran would have
tried such a hoax.
   Rafsanjani told a news conference last week he believed the
hostage problem was nearing a solution, but he repeated denials of
any direct talks on the issue between Iran and the United States.
   Iran denies any connection with the kidnappings. It has said,
however, it would use its influence on the hostages' behalf if the
United States fulfills certain conditions, such as freeing billions
of dollars in frozen Iranian assets.
   ``The writings of certain local mass media in connection with
the hostages should be more carefully taken into consideration,''
wrote Jomhuri Islami. ``It is naive to see no link between these
writings and the plans sketched by the White House and arrogance
media.''
   ``Arrogance'' is a term used by Iran to refer to the United
States.
   The newspaper added: ``Such evidence unveils certain suspicious
efforts that are made to undermine the administration of President
Rafsanjani.''
   Another radical Tehran newspaper, Abrar, made similar comments
Sunday. It wrote, ``Washington may intend to create doubt among the
forces loyal to the Islamic revolution by insinuating the idea that
the existence of relations between Tehran and Washington is not too
far from reality.''
   The Westerners held in Lebanon are eight Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Told He Cannot Leave Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader was released
from house arrest Sunday but ordered to remain in the country
indefinitely.
   Laurent Gbagbo, who was put under house arrest Saturday, said
the order was lifted by the internal security minister, Gen. Issouf
Kone. But Kone said he cannot leave Ivory Coast until the president
announces plans to reverse the country's economic crisis.
   No explanation was given for the decision, Gbagbo said. No date
has been set for the president to address the economic situation.
   Ivory Coast is suffering a severe economic crisis rooted in
slumping prices of cocoa and coffee, its main exports. Austerity
measures proposed by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny led to
widespread student protests, which Gbagbo supported.
   The president three times has postponed a National Council
meeting to discuss the new measures, which would cut government
salaries by up to 40 percent and impose a 10 percent tax on private
sector employees.
   Gbagbo, a history professor and leader of the Ivorian Popular
Front, has blamed the economic crisis on the autocratic rule of
Houphouet-Boigny and his Democratic Party. Gbagbo has repeatedly
called for multiparty elections.
   ``The minister told me I've been talking too much,'' said Gbagbo.
   On Saturday he was put under house arrest for the third time
since 1988.
   Houphouet-Boigny, 84, has ruled Ivory Coast since its
independence from France in 1960. He argues the multiparty system
creates tribal divisions on a continent wrought by ethnic rivalries.
   The proposed austerty measures last month led to violent
protests, which soldiers and police broke up with truncheons, tear
gas and stun grenades. Protesters stoned and burned cars and
ransacked stores.
   The government defused the unrest by promising to review the
economic proposals. It also pledged to cut prices of staple foods
and rents on government housing.

<TEXT>
   Howard Rollins, co-star of NBC's ``In the
Heat of the Night,'' admits he was addicted to drugs and alcohol
but firmly denies tabloid newspaper reports that he has AIDS.
   The actor, who portrays detective Virgil Tibbs, said his
addictions drove him to consider suicide just three days before
Christmas.
   An inner voice, he said, was telling him: ``Just go ahead and
kill me. I'm sick of it. I'll never straighten out my life, I'll
never have the career I want. How can I talk about a career when I
can't even stop using drugs? Why can't I just take a gun to my head
and be out of this misery?''
   He said he took his last drug on Dec. 28. Then he packed up his
drug paraphernalia and stomped it to pieces. ``I have a thing
inside, a needing or craving, that I am constantly dealing with,''
he said in an interview published in the March 17 issue of TV Guide
magazine.
   Rollins said he was only an occasional user when he landed the
Tibbs role in 1987, but was hopelessly addicted within six months.
   During the first season, he was arrested in Baton Rouge, La., on
charges of cocaine possession and drunken driving. That led to him
twice entering rehabilitation centers, but both times he failed to
stop using drugs.
   Toward the end of the show's second season, he began to miss
work. ``I got too tired and it was too much to be able to keep that
front up. Everyone knew I was high,'' he said.
   In November he was hospitalized after suffering chest pains and
was told he had developed an enlarged heart chamber because of his
drug use. That news led him to enter the drug clinic at Atlanta's
Anchor Hospital.
   While there, his file photographs were sold to the tabloids.
``They apparently paid people to take my dietary files, then paid
someone to tell them what I said in confidence in therapy
sessions,'' he said.
   He said he told the therapy group, ``It's really hell having to
live in a world where you have to deal with diseases like AIDS, or
you have to deal with racism.''
   That remark, he said, was twisted around to make it seem as if
he had the disease. Asked in the interview if he had tested
positive for the virus that is responsible for AIDS, Rollins said,
``No, no, no.''

   A high school senior who served up
grilled Norwegian salmon to a panel of finicky chefs won first
prize in a cook-off contest and a $30,000 scholarship to pursue a
culinary career.
   Carl Fortin, 18, of Hope, N.J., beat out nine finalists Saturday
to win the National Recipe Cook-Off Contest for high school
students sponsored by Johnson &amp; Wales University. The four-year
scholarship has a value of $30,504.
   The 10 finalists were culled from regional cook-offs during the
past few months. Students had three hours to order the food they
needed from the school's kitchens, prepare the meal and serve it to
the judges. Dishes were judged on creativity, taste and nutrition.
   Scott Luscier of Stamford, Vt., placed second, winning a $5,000
scholarship with his spinach-stuffed chicken breast. James Hlavacek
of North Haven, Conn., was third and claimed a $4,000 scholarship
with his orange chicken twist.

   Officials of the Dallas Zoo, looking for a way to
beat the Texas heat, may turn to a gorilla on the rocks.
   A ``gorilla cooler'' isn't some kind of exotic drink. Designers
of the zoo's new gorilla habitat are working to develop ``cool
rocks,'' refrigerated fake rocks, to encourage the zoo's four
gorillas to stay outside when it's hot.
   ``But at times, they just won't be seen,'' said zoo curator Ron
Kagan, ``and we're going to say to people, `That's good. Like you,
you go to the bathroom and close the door, and so do they.'
Sometimes that can add to the element of mystery and discovery at
the zoo.''
   The zoo's gorillas, which are being kept indoors, will be moved
into their new, $3.6 million outdoor home in April.

   It's not quite shooting fish in a barrel,
but a dedicated angler who stocked his backyard swimming pool with
fish for the winter says it guarantees that the big ones nearly
always are biting.
   ``There are days I can go out there and catch fish over and
over,'' said Lamar Collins, a 49-year-old contractor. ``Most of
them know what my baits are and where I bought them.''
   Later this month the bass, crappie and bluegill go back to the
Tennessee River and Flint Creek, where they were caught with rod
and reel, and people again will swim the pool.
   There are about 50 fish in the pool, maybe more. Feeding time is
every two weeks, when Collins puts about 10 to 12 dozen minnows in
the pool, he said.
   Collins began his backyard fishing hole last year by pumping
down his pool, letting it refill with rain water, then stocking it
when cool weather started around Oct. 1.
   ``I hardly miss a day picking up a rod, either for practice
throwing or to see if they're biting,'' he said.
   If he plans to fish the river, Collins said trying his luck in
the pool can be a good indicator of how the fish will be biting.
   ``You can observe from the water depth as to where you need to
fish in the river,'' he said. ``If they're in the shallow end of
the pool they'll probably be feeding in shallow water wherever you
fish.''

   An architectural draftsman who followed his
girlfriend to Massachusetts and couldn't get a job has become an FM
radio personality after putting his plea for work on a billboard:
``Help! I Need A Job.''
   About 100 calls, nine radio and television appearances and two
newspaper stories later, Bill Whiteman starts Monday at rock
station WAAF in Worcester.
   The idea didn't take off immediately, however. The first day the
billboard went up on a Boston thoroughfare, Whiteman said he got no
calls.
   So the second day the 30-year-old went out and stood under it
wearing a sign around his neck: ``Need Job. Ask Me About One Month
Free Special.''
   More than 60 interested employers called Whiteman, who left his
job in Syracuse when his girlfriend got a job as a nurse at a
Boston Hospital.
   One of those intrigued by the billboard was Ron Valeri, the
programming director for WAAF.
   ``I'm always impressed by this kind of guerilla self-promotion
in the field,'' Valeri said. ``This is exactly the kind of things
more DJs should practice. This gets attention.''
   Valeri said Whiteman, who had trial appearances on WAAF Thursday
and Friday, is a natural. ``Have you ever met someone and thought
`That person should be in show business?' Bill Whiteman is a disc
jockey in disguise.''
   WAAF broadcasts from Worcester to Boston and its targeted
audience is males between the ages of 18-34. Valeri, who describes
Whiteman as ``a little bit strange,'' said his new hire should fit
right in at the station.
   Whiteman, who on Monday begins his daily shift between 2 p.m.
and 6 p.m., said he was nervous at first. But he has calmed down
some, he said.
   ``The worst thing I could be is unemployed, and I was that
already,'' he said. As he understands it, the job entails ``playing
some music and being sort of friendly.'' And it has its perks, he
said.
   ``I don't have to be there until one in the afternoon,'' he
said. ``I can work on my golf game.''

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brash and sometimes bumbling criminals
have staged a rash of bank robberies in Ohio's capital city and its
suburbs.
   The Columbus area, with a population of about 1.2 million, has
had 42 bank robberies this year, more than Chicago, Detroit,
Pittsburgh and Cleveland combined.
   ``Why are there so many bank robberies? Frankly, right now we
don't have a clue,'' said FBI agent Douglass Ogden. ``If we knew
that, we'd stop them.''
   Authorities suspect many of the robbers are down-and-out drug
addicts looking for quick cash.
   That theory was borne out with the arrest Friday of a man who
admitted to robbing eight banks since Feb. 7, claiming he used the
money to support a $900-a-day crack habit.
   The man, named Jesse ``James'' Dalton Jr. although authorities
say he is no relation to the outlaw Jesse James or the Dalton
brothers, confessed to the robberies after being shown photos taken
by bank cameras.
   A man who robbed a bank Tuesday lost his fake beard and looked
directly at the bank camera before fleeing, police said.
   ``These are not real sophisticates,'' said Capt. Frank Phillips,
head of the police detective bureau. ``They're not getting much
during the robbery, and most of them aren't getting away, either.''
   Ogden said the robberies have involved small amounts _ generally
no more than $1,000. He would not release specific figures.
   There have been 21 arrests in the 42 robberies. All of the
defendants are awaiting trial.
   One man was arrested while counting his booty in his getaway
vehicle _ a city bus _ March 5 after he allegedly robbed the same
Bank One branch for the third time in a week. Police charged him in
six bank heists.
   Ed Billman, vice president of Banc One Corp., which owns Bank
One, said security has been increased at the branch. He said more
plainclothes security guards would be stationed at his banks and
that police have agreed to stop in periodically.
   ``I think there's a combination of bravery and stupidity at work
here,'' said Phillips. ``I mean, most of these people are walking
into the banks with no gun and, in most cases, no disguise, and
they're looking right at the camera. This isn't Bonnie and Clyde
we're dealing with.''
   But authorities aren't taking the trend lightly.
   On March 2, five banks were hit, prompting Mayor Dana Rinehart
to call for more bank security and more FBI presence.
   ``So far, nobody has been hurt. These people come into the bank,
get the money and leave,'' Rinehart said. ``But sooner or later,
somebody will get hurt. ... This will all end when one of these
robbers gets shot with a .45 in the chest. It's a heck of a way to
terminate the problem, but it sure gets the word out.''
   Ogden said the FBI, police and bank security officials have met
to determine the best way to stop the robberies. He would not give
details, but he indicated security would be increased inside and
outside bank branches in Franklin County, which includes Columbus.
   He also hopes to increase his number of agents. He would not say
how many agents are assigned to the Columbus office, which oversees
12 counties.
   Ogden said his office is ``quite overwhelmed'' by the robberies
in Columbus this year. Last year, bank robberies were down 50
percent from 1988, when 98 were reported, a record for the Columbus
area.
   FBI figures show that Chicago has had 10 bank robberies so far
this year, Detroit had nine, Pittsburgh four and metropolitan
Cleveland three. Los Angeles, in contrast, has had 110.
   ``These things go in cycles,'' said Ogden.
   He pointed out that the Columbus freeway system makes for easy
getaways. Two interstates cut through the city in each direction,
and both connect with an outerbelt.
   Banks are fighting back by giving informants rewards of up to
$2,000 and providing tellers with dye packs _ cannisters of paint
that can be programmed to explode, marking the loot.
   ``I know of one teller who stuffed a dye pack down a robber's
shirt. There's some guy out there with a real red chest right now.
It shouldn't be too hard to find him,'' Billman said.

<HEAD>Cuba Bracing For Sharp Cutbacks in Aid After Upheavals in East
Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is bracing itself for the possibility of a
U.S. invasion and for sharp cutbacks in its foreign trade as a
result of the upheavals in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   At the same time, President Fidel Castro is as determined as
ever to stay on the socialist path despite the trend elsewhere
toward free-market economies.
   Throughout Havana, signs remind citizens of that determination.
``Socialism come what may,'' said a large banner in an auditorium
where Castro spoke last week.
   The development of a strong defense to guard against a U.S.
invasion has been a high priority for years, and even more so
lately.
   A young Cuban who recently completed three years of military
service told a visiting American the other day that he spent
virtually the entire time digging tunnels along the north coast for
hiding soldiers, tanks and planes and for sheltering hospitals.
   ``I was a pick and shovel man,'' he said, looking down at his
hands and recalling the harsh labor.
   For the past decade, Cuba has devised a strategy whereby in the
event of aggression, the entire population would be mobilized in
defense. Castro said in a speech Wednesday that efforts are being
made to ensure maximum military self-sufficiency.
   If the United States imposes an air and naval blockade, steps
have been taken to guarantee that ``all the bullets, all the
rifles, the mines, the grenades, all the arms necessary'' are
available to fight the enemy, he said. Any invading force, he said,
would spill a ``river of blood.''
   Castro said Cuba is manufacturing much of its own weaponry these
days, utilizing iron imported from Angola. It is one of the
country's few remaining allies.
   Castro ridiculed the United States for its habit of deposing
unfriendly leaders in small countries and then declaring a
``colossal victory.''
   ``As a rule, in their military adventures, the tears begin when
the remains (of the soldiers) begin to arrive, when the coffins
begin to arrive,'' he said.
   ``And those we can supply in great quantity if they invade
Cuba,'' he added. ``Industrial quantities we can supply so they
won't get bored and won't stop crying a single day.''
   Castro also warned of the possibility of a peacetime crisis.
Special measures would be required, he said, if problems in the
Soviet Union lead to a cutoff of oil supplies to Cuba. The supplies
average 12 million tons annually.
   ``What would happen if suddenly we don't have the 12 million?''
he asked. ``If there are only four, we have to know that.''
   In case of this, all construction of schools, day care centers,
health centers and housing would stop, the president said. Bus
service in Havana could be reduced from 30,000 trips a day to
10,000. On the farm, mules would have to replace tractors.
   The anti-Communist upheavals in Eastern Europe have cast doubt
on Cuba's future trade and political relations with that region.
   Castro heaped ridicule on the four Warsaw Pact members _
Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria _ which either
co-sponsored or supported a U.S. proposal in the U.N. Human Rights
Commission last week calling attention to alleged rights abuses in
Cuba. The proposal was approved 17-12.
   The shifting political allegiances of the East Europeans could
mean a cutback in Cuba's trade with those nations, but Castro
almost seemed to welcome that possibility.
   In exchange for Cuban citrus fruits, nickel and other products,
the East Europeans often provided ``junk'' in return, he said.
   As an example, he said, ``Hungarian buses get six kilometers
(four miles) per gallon, fill the city with smoke and poison
everybody.''
   Soon, he added, ``We're going to free ourselves from all that,''
with the help of higher-quality buses made in Cuba.

<HEAD>Oliver Stone Says Directors' Award May Speed His Work to the
Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver Stone, whose films often
follow tortuous paths to the screen, said winning the Directors
Guild of America award for ``Born on the Fourth of July'' should
speed his filmmaking process.
   ``It's giving me more freedom,'' Stone said Saturday night after
collecting the guild's top honor at its annual awards ceremony, a
bellwether for the Academy Awards.
   ``It's a tremendous validation for me. It means I'm doing the
right thing,'' said Stone, a self-described anarchist who has
directed a variety of deeply personal films, including ``Salvador''
and ``Wall Street.''
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Stone's account of the patriot
soldier Ron Kovic whose attitudes about war are shattered in
Vietnam, took more than 10 years to make.
   ``Platoon,'' the acclaimed Vietnam film that Stone also
directed, similarly was a hard sell.
   He said some film projects _ like ``Born on the Fourth of July''
_ can be improved when they have a long time to percolate. He was
quick to point out, too, that simply winning prizes and producing
box-office hits does not make movie making a cake walk.
   ```How sweet it is and how fleeting,'' he said when collecting
his award at a black-tie dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Backstage, he said his triumph soon would be old news. ``Success
and failure are both impostors,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Stone joins an elite list of directors who have
taken the guild's top honor twice in their careers (Stone also won
for ``Platoon''). Other dual winners include Joseph Mankiewicz,
George Stevens, David Lean, Robert Wise, Francis Ford Coppola and
Milos Forman.
   Stone, who becomes the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for
best director, said he plans to make a third film about Vietnam in
the next several years. He declined to say what the film will focus
on, saying only that it will not concern combat but ``another
aspect'' of war.
   Stone currently is working on a movie about the musical group
The Doors.
   In the 42 years the guild has been handing out the awards, only
three of its picks failed to win the Oscar.
   In addition to Stone, those nominated by the guild for best
director of a feature film were Woody Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Rob Reiner for ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' Phil
Alden Robinson for ``Field of Dreams'' and Peter Weir for ``Dead
Poets Society.''
   The Academy did not nominate Reiner or Robinson. Allen, Stone
and Weir are Oscar nominees, along with Kenneth Branagh for ``Henry
V'' and Jim Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   The guild awards _ chosen by a vote of the 9,000 members _ also
recognize best director in several other categories: television
comedy series, dramatic series (day and night), musical-variety,
dramatic specials, sports and commercials.
   Among the others honored were the directors of TV's ``Murphy
Brown'' and ``L.A. Law'' series.
   In television, the award for best director in a comedy went to
Barnet Kellman for the episode ``Brown Like Me,'' on CBS' ``Murphy
Brown.''
   Other TV awards: Dramatic special, Dan Curtis for ABC's ``War
and Remembrance''; dramatic nighttime series, Eric Laneuville for
the ``I'm in the Nude'' episode on NBC's ``L.A. Law''; dramatic
daytime series, Victoria Hochberg for the ``Jacob Have I Loved''
episode on PBS' ``Wonderworks.''
   Also, for musical variety show, Don Mischer for ``Gregory Hines:
Tap Dance in America,'' on PBS' ``Great Performances''; television
documentary, Peter Rosen for ``The Eighth Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition'' on PBS; sports event show, Bob Fishman for the
1989 U.S. Open Tennis Tournament on CBS.

   Vice Adm. J.M. Boorda, a sailor since he ran
away to join the Navy at age 16, tends to use a salty phrase or two
when he thinks of what Gramm-Rudman budget-cutters may do to his
beloved service.
   As Congress and the White House remain locked in a test of
political wills over major military personnel cuts, Boorda can see
only one result: His people will lose.
   ``There are two trains running together, the administration and
... Democrats, and my sailors are sitting in the middle,'' Boorda
told a House panel last week.
   He says the seaman on patrol in the Mediterranean or the Army
soldier who landed in Panama are too busy to know what the Office
of Management and Budget is, or who sits on the House or Senate
armed services committees _ known on Capitol Hill as OMB, HASC or
SASC.
   ``All they know is they got screwed by the people in
Washington,'' Boorda said.
   Boorda, a handful of service personnel and even the joint chiefs
have been making the rounds in Congress, appearing before House and
Senate committees to try to avert major personnel cuts.
   The battle is over the Pentagon's request to transfer $935
million from weapons accounts to military personnel to avoid the
impact of the Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting law.
   Without the authority to shift funds, the Defense Department
says it will have to lay off tens of thousands of men and women in
the military, freeze promotions and put transfers on hold.
   President Bush had the option last August to exempt military
personnel from the law as the Reagan administration had done in
previous years.
   Instead, White House Budget Director Richard Darman and the
administration decided not to exclude personnel, assuming that four
committees _ House and Senate armed services and House and Senate
defense appropriations _ would later allow them to shift the funds.
   So far, the gamble has failed.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, declined to bring up the request before his panel,
telling the Pentagon he didn't want to play their ``shell game.''
   ``Putting weapons before people was their decision and now
they're stuck with it,'' Aspin said.
   The House chairman has the backing of the Democratic leadership.
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said last week that
Congress can't allow the administration to shift funds on military
accounts when it can't be done on domestic accounts.
   ``The administration is responsible for this decision, not
Congress,'' Foley said.
   Although House Democrats are standing firm, the fight continues.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted last week to grant the
Pentagon part of the authority to transfer funds, allowing $795
million of the $935 million requested.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services panel,
accused the Pentagon of making a ``conscious decision to exploit a
loophole'' in the budget-cutting law.
   ``I want to make it clear that we voted on the side of the men
and women in the military who were put at risk by the
administration's decision not to use its authority to exempt the
military personnel accounts,'' Nunn said Friday.
   Christopher Jehn, the Pentagon's assistant secretary of defense
for force management and personnel, told a Senate subcommittee that
the department did not ask Bush to exempt personnel because there
wouldn't have been enough money to train them.
   ``The trade-off was whether we should protect personnel accounts
and wind up with what amounted to an imbalanced budget,'' Jehn said.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded six feet from a
Syrian army checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut on Sunday and wounded
14 people, police said.
   They said a light blue Mercedes-Benz rigged with explosives
detonated at 4 p.m. It damaged at least six parked cars and
shattered windows in several nearby buildings.
   Nervous Syrian soldiers sealed off the scene as ambulances
converged on the area in the Qasqas residential district. No group
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Syria has about 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. They are stationed in all areas except
the Christian enclave and the southern zone along the Israeli
border.
   Also Sunday, troops of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun traded sporadic
machine-gun fire with Lebanese Forces militiamen in Christian east
Beirut, killing a man, police said.
   They said the two sides battled in the east Beirut districts of
Ashrafiyeh, Dora and Sin el-Fil.
   The man, a civilian, was killed in Dora, according to police.
They had no further details.
   Aoun's command said a Lebanese army soldier died in hospital
Saturday of bullet wounds he suffered from sniping the day before.
   That increased to 754 the number of people killed since Jan. 30
in the battle for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   The battle pits Aoun's mainly Christian soldiers against the
fighters of Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces Christian
militia.

Sudan Railways Corporation said Sunday.
   The corporation reported that the accident occurred Saturday on
a line linking the capital, Khartoum, to the Mediterranean town of
Port Sudan.
   It said two 20-year-old men were killed. One 20-year-old man and
three teen-agers were wounded, said the railway statement.
   The accident took place at the Ogarin station, 175 miles
northeast of Khartoum.
   The crowded train carried both people and cargo. Many people
were riding on top of the cars, which is common but illegal in
Sudan.

   Thirty-nine convicted drug smugglers were
hanged Sunday, the latest executions carried out under the
government's anti-narcotics crackdown, Tehran radio reported.
   The radio broadcast said the 39 were charged with smuggling or
selling a total of 3,470 pounds of opium and 139 pounds of heroin.
The hangings occurred in 12 cities.
   Iranian law mandates the death sentence for possession of even
small quantities of drugs with intent to sell. More than 1,200 drug
smugglers have been hanged in Iran since a crackdown began in
December 1988.
   The radio has reported as many as 80 hangings in a single day.
Opposition groups maintain the drug-related hangings are used to
mask executions of political dissidents.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani urged police Sunday to
continue the crackdown on drugs, the radio said.
   ``The fight in this direction is a serious step toward
rehabilitating our economy and society. It blocks the way for
corrupt individuals, and will stop innocent people from falling
into corruption,'' Rafsanjani was quoted as saying.

   These are tough times for NBC's venerable
``Today'' show, the program that invented the morning TV format.
   Last week it lost in the ratings to ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for the ninth consecutive week, and it lost the February
``sweeps'' to ABC for the first time since November 1985.
   Is the sun going down on ``Today''? Is this a new dawn for ABC's
``Good Morning America''? Will ``CBS This Morning'' emerge from the
twilight of third place? Has success spoiled Bryant Gumbel?
   ``Today'' ratings began declining with co-host Jane Pauley's
poised and public departure from the show after 13 years. Her
replacement, NBC newswoman Deborah Norville, apparently reminds
some women of their least-favorite college roommate.
   ``The `Today' show has experienced a serious decline, about 15
percent on average, since Deborah Norville took over,'' said David
Marans, head of media research for the J. Walter Thompson
advertising conglomerate.
   ``There was a clear reaction to the change in casting,'' he
said. ``We could see no other reason for the needle really moving.''
   CBS' morning efforts generally have run a distant third in
ratings almost since the network began competing with ``Today'' in
1954. Predecessors of ``CBS This Morning'' changed personnel, sets
and style so often that a loyal viewer was someone who occasionally
tuned in just to see who or what was still there.
   The current CBS edition's latest attempt at innovation, in
February, was to cashier Harry Smith's co-anchor, Kathleen
Sullivan, in favor of ex-ABC newswoman Paula Zahn and a barely
discernible improvement in ratings.
   ABC, keeping the same cast before its cameras, won the No. 1
spot without significantly increasing its ratings.
   ``It takes a long time to develop a team,'' said Jack Reilly,
executive producer of ``Good Morning America.'' ``It takes an even
longer time for the audience to accept it.''
   Reilly noted that, historically, ``Today'' has led in household
ratings but ABC's show has been more popular among advertisers'
most desirable target groups _ women aged 18 to 49 and men and
women aged 25 to 54.
   NBC officials insist that they're not worried about the numbers.
   ``We knew there was going to be a drop in the ratings for the
`Today' show,'' said NBC research chief Bob Niles. ``The good news
is that we were pretty good about forecasting it. The bad news is
we didn't want to see those numbers.''
   Niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after Gumbel replaced
Tom Brokaw as co-host in January 1982. For the next two years, ABC
beat ``Today'' like a gong. One week in August 1983, ``Today''
finished third for the first time.
   Overall, since January ``Today'' has lagged an average
six-tenths of a rating point behind ``Good Morning America,'' for a
loss of about 600,000 viewers, Niles said.
   Niles said the decline has not prompted NBC to conduct any
immediate audience research to discover just what the problem is.
   ABC's Reilly said: ``Everyone forgets that the pressure that
brought on all these problems over there there was that we were
beating them.''
   And, he noted, it took ``Today'' five years to climb back to No.
1 after Gumbel joined the show.
   Gumbel presaged the current troubles with a memo criticizing
weatherman Willard Scott and other ``Today'' personalities.
   The memo to then-producer Marty Ryan savaged Scott's cornball
act and the timeliness of movie maven Gene Shalit's reviews. It
also faulted consumer reporters David Horowitz and Betty Furness
and medical reporter Dr. Art Ulene.
   Only Pauley escaped Gumbel's wrath. Ryan was succeeded by Tom
Capra, a longtime news producer, who was moving from California to
New York on Friday and could not be interviewed for this story.
   Gumbel, who declined to be interviewed, will be questioned by
Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20'' Friday in what should be a
benchmark among interviews of network anchors by other anchors.
   Walters made her own reputation on ``Today,'' which began Jan.
14, 1952, under the late Dave Garroway.
   While ``Today'' is losing viewers with the latest cast change,
there's a hitch for the network competitors.
   ``They're going elsewhere,'' Marans said. ``For the past eight
weeks, there hasn't been a significant increase in ABC or CBS
viewership.''
   So where are they going? Analysts suggest they're tuning in to
increasingly sophisticated local TV morning shows or disappearing
into the cable box.
   ABC's Reilly said the vanishing viewer has been a problem for
the networks for five years. ``There is no one alternative that
comes near (the networks), but collectively there are so many
options out there that people use them.''

<HEAD>Israel May Demand Reparations From A United Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is entitled to and may demand
reparations for the Holocaust from a united Germany, the Israeli
ambassador to West Germany said in an interview released Sunday.
   ``I can't rule out that Israel will demand reparations at some
point,'' Benjamin Navon, a Holocaust survivor, told the
mass-circulation daily Bild in an interview to be published Monday.
   A 1950s reparations agreement with West Germany ``spells out
explicitly that we are entitled to do so in the case of German
unity,'' the ambassador said. The interview was released in advance
of publication to other media.
   West Germany has paid $44 billion in reparations to Israel and
Jewish Holocaust survivors around the world under the agreement. By
the end of this decade, payments are expected to reach $55.5
billion.
   But East Germany for years refused to accept moral
responsibility for the Holocaust or pay reparations. The former
Communist leaders argued that they themselves were persecuted by
the Nazis and therefore could not be held accountable for the
genocide in which 6 million Jews perished.
   After the hard-line leadership was toppled by a popular
rebellion in the fall, the new government announced that all German
people share responsibility for the ``terrible crimes against the
Jewish people.''
   Also last month, Israel and East Germany held preliminary talks
about establishing diplomatic ties. Israel has said it would only
establish relations if East Germany accepted moral responsibility
for the Holocaust and paid reparations.
   Israeli officials have said privately that considering East
Germany's crumbling economy, they would be willing to settle for
token payments.
   Navon said in the Bild interview that East Germany was ``morally
obligated'' to pay reparations.
   ``East Germany also was part of the former Third Reich, but has
always refused to deal with its Nazi past,'' he said.
   Asked about Israel's views on German unity, he said: ``We have
faith in the German democracy. We are convinced that a united
Germany will nurture positive and friendly relations with my
country and my people.''
   However, Navon pointed out that many Israelis were concerned
about the rapid move toward German unification. ``You have to
understand: tens of thousands of Israelis carry the death camp
number on their arm, they have suffered terribly.''
   After World War II, Israel served as a refuge for tens of
thousands of Holocaust survivors.
   When Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens embraced the idea of a
unified democratic Germany, his statement caused an uproar in
Israel.

   Broadway stars from yesterday and today came
together to honor George Abbott, one of Broadway's greatest
playwrights and directors, during a benefit to raise money for AIDS
research.
   Sophia Loren was host and producer-director Hal Prince,
director-choreographer Tommy Tune, and performers Van Johnson,
Nancy Walker, Eddie Albert, Eartha Kitt, Margaret Whiting and
Nanette Fabray were among luminaries on hand Saturday night.
   The evening's highlight was a two-hour revue of songs from
Abbott's most famous shows, which include ``A Funny Thing Happened
On The Way To The Forum,'' ``Pajama Game,'' ``Pal Joey,'' and
``Damn Yankees.''
   Abbott, 102, lives on Indian Creek Island with his 58-year-old
wife, Joy.
   About 700 guests paid $500 or more to attend the event at
Williams Island sponsored by the Community Alliance Against AIDS.
Organizers raised more than $425,000 for an AIDS unit at Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami.
   Loren also was host at the event last year. The actress is a
spokeswoman for the luxury development at Williams Island, which
underwrote the dinner for the second year. The event started in
1987 with Elizabeth Taylor as chairwoman.

<TEXT>
   The stalemate in the Afghanistan war is
unraveling the political consensus that has characterized U.S.
policy toward the embattled nation for the past 10 years.
   When the Soviets withdrew their troops from Afghanistan, CIA
analysts predicted that in a matter of months the Mujahedeen rebels
would topple the Soviet-installed government and march triumphantly
to the presidential palace in Kabul.
   A year later, the fighting is at a stalemate. And Congress,
until recently solidly behind the administration's policy with
covert allocations that reportedly hit $600 million annually, is
starting to rebel.
   The administration should not expect ``the automatic and routine
continuation of a program that wasn't challenged for a decade,''
said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
subcommittee on Asia who convened a hearing last week on
Afghanistan.
   At a hearing on the direction of U.S. support for the
Mujahedeen, Solarz and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the No. 2
Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, repeatedly
questioned the need to keep the Afghanistan program secret and
argued for public debate of U.S. policy.
   The State Department and the CIA, meanwhile, appear engaged in a
turf battle over policy toward the rebels.
   U.S. Afghan policy began to unravel soon after the Soviets
completed the pullout of their troops in February 1989, a period
that coincided with the transition from the Reagan to the Bush
administrations.
   In the time it took the new administration to settle in, a
vacuum formed which the CIA was happy to fill with the personnel it
already had in place, said Barnett R. Rubin, an expert on
Afghanistan who testified at Solarz's hearing.
   Subsequently, the State Department began to weigh in but many of
the operational decisions such as which rebel factions should get
how many weapons are still in the CIA's hands, said Rubin, who is a
research fellow at the congressionally endowed Institute of Peace.
   He said ``there are extremely divergent views within the
government about'' the situation in Afghanistan and where U.S.
interests lie.
   ``What disturbs me most about the American role in all this is
the degree to which the United States has become involved in what
are essentially internal Afghan affairs,'' said Robert Peck, who
until last June was the administration's chief specialist on
Afghanistan.
   With the Soviet enemy gone and Afghan factions vying for
political ascendancy, ``the logic of the Afghan situation argues
that we should be disengaging, (rather than) plunging in more
deeply,'' he said in congressional testimony.
   For 10 years, the United States secretly trained and armed the
Mujahedeen rebels so they could defeat the Soviet troops who
invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
   Saudi Arabia was a major contributor to the effort, and the
Pakistani secret service was put in charge of distributing the
American weapons to the array of rebel factions headquartered in
Pakistan.
   The murky situation, in which the Pakistani secret service is
reportedly exploiting divisions among the rebel leaders and playing
the groups off against each other, was not helped by the March 6
coup attempt against President Najib.
   At least 56 people died and 200 others were injured in the
revolt by soldiers loyal to the renegade defense minister, Gen.
Shah Nawaz Tanai. Tanai was supported by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a
fundamentalist guerrilla leader who until last year was among the
rebel commanders in the U.S.-backed Mujahedeen coalition.
   In recent months, it has become increasingly clear that Najib's
government _ with massive infusions of Soviet weaponry to the tune
of more than $300 million a month _ was far more durable even
without help from Soviet troops than the CIA predicted.
   The Mujahedeen, hampered by internal divisions and by its
orientation primarily as a guerrilla force, has been unable to
wrest control of Afghanistan's cities from government troops.
   And the administration has been forced to rethink its moves.
   The objective is still the same, U.S. officials say _ getting
rid of the Soviet-installed Najib. But the focus is shifting from
doing so by military might to achieving that goal through a
political settlement.
   ``A military solution could be protracted,'' said one official
who asked not to be named. ``We want to try and shape events toward
a political solution.''
   Later this month, State Department officials will meet with
their Soviet counterparts to discuss Najib's future. The Kremlin is
willing to support Najib's eventual ouster but insists he remain in
charge of a transitional government, U.S. officials say. The United
States insist he must go.
   The United States is directing its sights toward the convening
of a council of all Afghan opposition groups this summer, a forum
known as a ``shura,'' which would elect representatives to
negotiate a transition to elected government. Experts outside
government are skeptical the shura will take place.
   ``Unfortunately, putting Afghanistan back together again is
likely to take a long time _ even if we knew how to do it,'' Peck
said. ``If there is one learn we should have drawn from our role''
in Afghanistan ``it is that Afghans are not easily programmed. They
do not hold the advice of outsiders in particularly high esteem.''
   Instead of negotiating with the Soviets about Najib, the United
States should agree with the Kremlin for both sides to stop arming
the combatants, Peck said. Conservatives in Congress argue
vehemently against such a move, saying it would give the Najib
government, with its large stocks of weapons, an unfair advantage
over the Mujahedeen.

<HEAD>Chile's New President: A Veteran Politician Who Turned Against
Pinochet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chile, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin is a veteran
and savvy politican who broke with Gen. Augusto Pinochet and helped
lead the movement that voted the right-wing leader out of office.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old lawyer who took office Sunday, often says
he lacks a leader's personality. In fact, the tall and lanky
politician with sloping posture and a plaintive voice is fond of
saying he is ``not presidential.''
   But his long career in politics belies that self-portrait.
   He has been president of the Senate, seven times president of
his centrist Christian Democratic Party, and in the 1960s he
presided over the U.N. General Assembly. During that time he became
known as a persuasive negotiator who believes in compromise but who
also can stick to his principles when pushed.
   Aylwin is the son of a Supreme Court chief justice. He was born
Nov. 26, 1918, in San Bernardo, then a rural community just south
of Santiago and now a bustling suburb.
   As a law student, Aylwin joined the then-budding socialist
movement in Chile. Soon afterward, however, he turned to the
Christian Democrats, partly because of his strong belief in Roman
Catholicism.
   In the party, which is Chile's largest, he gained a reputation
as a conservative and an enemy of the left. He never accepted the
label rightist, however, calling himself a centrist.
   He explains that in Latin America ``leftists have often said
that social changes are legitimate, and they must be carried out
even if to do so it is necessary to break the law.''
   ``I've always rejected that because I think that breaking the
law brings more aggravation than progress to the poor,'' he said in
an interview shortly before his landslide election victory in
December. ``The law is the protection of the weak against the
powerful.''
   He also severely criticizes the right, saying it ``is selfish
and thinks only of protecting its economic interests.''
   Aylwin initially supported the bloody 1973 military coup in
which Pinochet seized power and toppled an elected leftist
government during a period of economic and political turmoil. Like
many Chileans, he believed the armed forces would quickly return to
the barracks after establishing order.
   He became disillusioned when it became evident Pinochet had no
plans to surrender power and instead was wielding it harshly to
repress dissent.
   Aylwin gradually joined the ranks of the goverment's outspoken
critics.
   When Pinochet called an October 1988 referendum on a proposal to
extend his rule to 1997, Aylwin emerged as leader of a broad
coalition of centrist and leftist groups that successfully
campaigned for the general's defeat.
   To nobody's surprise, he won nomination as the coalition's
presidential candidate in Dec. 14 elections, winning 55 percent of
the vote. His nearest challenger, a former Pinochet finance
minister, won just 29 percent.
   During his campaign, Aywin promised to respect human rights and
civil liberties and to increase spending on social programs. But he
said he plans no major changes in the country's fairly successful
free-market economic program.
   His election, he said, indicated the public's strong desire to
recover ``the right to decide by themselves'' and ``their dignity.''
   Aylwin and his wife, Leonor Oyarzun, have three adult sons and
two daughters.

   A five-carat diamond ring lost by Ringo Starr
turned up recently at a jewelry shop and has been returned to the
former Beatles drummer, police said Sunday.
   Starr, 49, lost the ring after a concert last October in the
French capital. Police estimated its worth at more than $172,000.
   The ring surfaced a few weeks ago at a jewelry shop in the St.
Ouen district of northern Paris, sold to the owner by a man police
said did not know it belonged to the rock star.
   By that time the diamond already had passed ``through several
persons,'' police said. Investigators later found and matched it
against a description provided by the insurance company.
   The ring has been returned to Starr and police said the jewelry
shop owner and the man who sold him the ring will face unspecified
criminal charges.

   Anti-government demonstrators marched
Sunday through the capital and in Timisoara, the cradle of the
December revolution, protesting what they said was the continued
prevalence of Communists and the dreaded Securitate.
   ``Down with Iliescu,'' chanted demonstrators in Timisoara,
referring to interim President Ion Iliescu, a former Communist who
ran afoul of deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Iliescu led the National Salvation Front that took power during
the chaos of the revolution and now heads the multiparty Council of
National Unity. The Council is the makeshift parliament that
succeeded the Front.
   The crowd, estimated at up to 15,000 by Ion Micu, an editor at
Radio Timisoara, also called for the resignation of Interior
Minister Gen. Mihai Chitac.
   Chitac has been accused of direct involvement in the violent
suppression of the December demonstrations in Timisoara, in which
scores were shot by forces loyal to Ceausescu. The violence in
Timisoara, about 250 miles west of Bucharest, sparked the
revolution that swept the country and finally toppled Ceausescu
Dec. 22.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed on Christmas Day.
   Supporters say Chitac contributed to the success of the
revolution by siding with the Timisoara demonstrators against the
Securitate, Ceausescu's security force.
   Several hundred people also demonstrated in the northeastern
city of Iasi for the exposure of Securitate members and the removal
of former Communists from state bodies, the national news agency
Rompres reported.
   ``The Front Confiscated The Revolution,'' read one sign carried
in the Bucharest protest, which was attended by about 1,000.
   The Front, dominated by former Communists who ran afoul of
Ceausescu, has since been forced to share power until May 20
elections.
   ``This government came to power illegally,'' said Bucharest
demonstrator George Vijan, standing in front of the provisional
government headquarters in Victory Square. ``They did not come from
the revolutionary people.''
   ``They represent a group of Communists from the 1950s who are
guilty of crimes against the people,'' he said.
   ``Iliescu said that there is no more Securitate,'' said
demonstrator Marin Tileau, a 44-year-old hospital worker. ``But the
Securitate is still functioning in policemen's clothes.''
   The Securitate was officially disbanded after the revolution,
and its personnel were transferred from Interior Ministry to
Defense Ministry control. Some officers have gone on trial.
   Last month, the Defense Ministry published a breakdown on the
makeup of the Securitate and said the new security organization
being set up would not use repression or intimidation.
   It is a common anti-government theme here that the interim
government wants to maintain some totalitarian aspects of the
Ceausescu leadership.
   Opposition parties in the Council of National Unity are trying
to get the election postponed until autumn, on the grounds that the
Front now has an unfair advantage because of its domination of
Romanian politics since taking power in the revolution.
   All three demonstrations were peaceful and no arrests were
reported.

<HEAD>Colombians Vote After a Night of Violence</HEAD>

   Colombians voted for federal, state and
local candidates Sunday in an election that followed a night of
violence in which six people were killed, including two city
council candidates.
   No violence was reported at polling places as people lined up to
vote for senators, House representatives, state legislators and
municipal officials.
   The governing Liberal Party also chose its candidate in
presidential elections to be held May 27. One of three Liberal
frontrunners _ Cesar Gaviria, Hernando Duran Dussan and Ernesto
Samper _ was expected to win the primary and eventually succeed
President Virgilio Barco.
   Polls opened at 8 a.m. (same time EST) to allow the first of an
expected turnout of 7 million voters to cast ballots. There are
13.8 million Colombians, 18 years or older, who are allowed to vote
in the elections.
   The polls remained open until 4 p.m., and the first official
results were expected at 8 p.m.
   Colombians elected all 313 members of the nation's bicameral
legislature, 9,042 city councilmen, 1,009 mayors, and 421 state
assembly members.
   Former leaders of a leftist guerrilla group _ April 19 Movement,
or M19 _ campaigned in many races Saturday, just hours after
signing a treaty with the government that ended their 16-year
insurgency.
   But two other rebel groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the People's Liberation Army, refused to put down
their arms.
   And a third leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation
Army, said it will never enter peace talks. The group's campaign of
kidnappings and other terrorism to disrupt the election continued
Saturday night.
   In Chaparral, a town 125 miles south of Bogota, National
Liberation Army guerrillas killed two soldiers guarding voting
precints late Saturday, the Tolima state government office reported.
   Members of the group also killed Pablo Caro Ruiz, a Liberal
Party candidate for the city council of Tame, 205 miles north of
Bogota, according to a communique from the Interior Ministry.
   In the northern town of Bello, another Liberal Party candidate
for the city council, Libardo Antonio Taborda, was killed. Local
police said they had not established who was responsible for the
crime.
   Two local organizers for the leftist Patriotic Union Party were
shot and killed late Saturday in the town of Chigorodo, 155 miles
north of Bogota, state government officials said. Since its
founding in 1985, the Patriotic Union has been targeted by
right-wing death squads.

   Five people were reported
killed in factional fighting in black townships, and a black
newspaper Sunday said anti-apartheid groups should not be demanding
an end to police emergency powers.
   The leaders of black townships said the restrictive measures,
introduced in 1986, should not be lifted amid the wave of violence
that has claimed about 200 lives during the past month.
   ``For once, many of us are beginning to question the logic of
calling for the lifting of the state of emergency when we are still
senselessly killing each other like animals,'' City press said in a
Sunday editorial.
   A black policeman was among those killed in factional fighting
and clashes with police over the past 24 hours. The violence, in
all four provinces, included 13 attacks on police vehicles or
homes, Pretoria police said.
   Police used birdshot, tear gas, rubber bullets and a revolver
against crowds of blacks armed with stones and petrol bombs, police
said in a daily report. They said 16 people were injured and 20
were arrested.
   Residents of townships near Johannesburg and in Natal province
have asked the army to bring in reinforcements to stop the
factional fighting.
   But removal of troops from black townships has been a standing
demand of anti-apartheid groups since the state of emergency was
declared June 12, 1986 to put down anti-government protests and
black-on-black clashes.
   Police reinforcements were sent to Kathlehong, a black township
12 miles east of Johannesburg, government radio reported. In a
march on Friday, residents appealed for police to stop the violence
in which 23 people have died and scores were injured over the past
week.
   Township Mayor Tau Molotsi said the clashes began as a dispute
between rival taxi companies. He said dozens of people sought
refuge at the local police station and hospital and parents have
sent their children away.
   The emergency regulations allow police to detain suspects for up
to six months without charge, ban protests, and bar journalists and
the general public from protests and areas of unrest.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament Friday the
government was prepared to use its extensive powers under the
3{-year-old state of emergency to quell violence.
   Most of the recent clashes occurred in South Africa's 10 tribal
homelands, whereas fighting in the mid-1980s occurred mostly in
urban townships.
   Four of the homelands are independent republics, although they
are not recognized by any other country. They were established in
the 1960s as national states, where the 28-million black majority
could exercise political rights and own land.
   Anti-apartheid organizations say the system is a ploy to deprive
blacks of South African citizenship, and the homeland leaders have
been criticized by the African National Congress as collaborators
with the white minority government.
   Frank Ravele, leader of one nominally independent homeland of
Venda on Saturday legalized the African National Congress, the Pan
Africanist Congress, the Communist Party and other organizations.
   South African President P.W. Botha legalized the groups in
February and the Xhosa republics of Ciskei and Transkei recently
followed suit. Now they are only outlawed in Bophuthatswana.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.

<HEAD>Selma Mayor Says City Hall Campers Violating Court Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Activists protesting the ouster of Selma's
first black school superintendent camped out Sunday at City Hall
despite a court order barring them from the building outside
business hours.
   ``We're waiting to notify the judge that they're violating the
order,'' Mayor Joe Smitherman said. The mayor claims the
demonstrators have reduced city government to ``anarchy'' in the
past month.
   Police said a half-dozen protesters were inside City Hall over
the weekend, and some pitched two tents on the lawn in front of the
building, which Smitherman said also violated the court order.
   Circuit Judge Leslie Johnson issued a temporary ruling Saturday
barring protesters from spending the night, eating and playing
cards in City Hall, or from disrupting City Council business.
   Blacks have staged nearly continuous protests at City Hall and
have shouted down council members at meetings recently to protest
the white-controlled school board's decision against renewing the
contract of Norward Roussell.
   Roussell and his supporters blame his dismissal on racism.
   The school board, which is appointed by the majority-white City
Council, cited Roussell's management style in voting in December
not to renew his contract when it expires June 30.
   The controversy has included school boycotts by students and
teachers, and Selma's 6,000-student public school system was closed
for nearly a week in February for fear of violence.
   The school system is 75 percent black, and the city's population
is about 52 percent black.
   The mayor said he was not certain what the city might ask the
judge to do at a hearing this week or next.
   A spokesman for the group organizing the protest, the Best
Education Support Team, said members planned to continue the
sit-in, despite the judge's order.
   ``They certainly feel that the order does not serve justice.
They're going to stay there until justice rings,'' said BEST vice
president Ronald Peoples.
   Smitherman has blamed the protest in part on the 25th
anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march, saying
black leaders were trying to build interest in the march
re-enactment by drawing fresh attention to the city.
   The commemoration of the 1965 march ended Saturday with about
3,000 people marching on the Alabama Capitol.

<HEAD>Arrests of Sons in Rich Parents' Slayings Evokes Memories of
Similar Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mansion Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrests of two brothers in
connection with the slayings of their wealthy parents had a
familiar ring to police, prosecutors and some readers of the
popular press.
   It brought back memories of Ricky Kyle and the Billionaire Boys
Club, two of the more notorious cases in Southern California
involving murdered parents. But district attorney's spokeswoman
Sandi Gibbons cited two others Friday:
   _In what became known as the ``Ninja'' or ``Yom Kippur'' case,
Stewart Woodman was convicted of paying hit men to kill his elderly
parents on the Jewish holiday in 1985 to collect $500,000 in
insurance. He faces a possible death sentence; his brother Neil
goes on trial in the case in April.
   _Jeffrey Percell goes to trial April 6, charged with the slaying
of his 61-year-old parents, who were bound, gagged and shot in the
head. The November 1988 slaying was the first in years in sleepy,
prosperous Sierra Madre.
   But it is the Billionaire Boys and Ricky Kyle cases most brought
to mind by the arrests of Lyle and Erik Menendez for investigation
of murdering their father, Hollywood executive Jose Menendez, and
their mother Kitty, a former beauty queen.
   Lyle Mendendez, 22, was arrested Thursday in the August
slayings, in which the couple were found shot to death in their $5
million mansion. His 19-year-old brother surrendered to authorities
Sunday.
   Henry Harrison ``Ricky'' Kyle Jr. was sentenced in June 1987 to
five years in prison for killing his father, Texas millionaire
Henry Harrison Kyle Sr.
   The elder Kyle was in many ways similar to the elder Menendez.
Both were aggressive, hard-nosed businessmen.
   Menendez, a self-made multimillionaire, had fled the Castro
regime in Cuba to become a top executive with RCA, Hertz, and
finally the head of Live Entertainment, a big-time video outfit
affiliated with the company that makes the ``Rambo'' pictures.
   Kyle had built a $100 million empire that included apartments,
restaurants, dairy farms, a bank and a TV studio before heading to
Hollywood in 1983 after buying Four Star Productions.
   Prosecutors alleged Ricky Kyle killed his father because he
feared he would be cut out of his will after the father called him
a cocaine-using liar and thief.
   He claimed he was searching for a prowler in the darkened dining
room of the family's Bel-Air mansion when he mistook his father for
the intruder and shot him to death.
   Kyle described his father as an abusive terror. After a first
trial ended in a mistrial, a second jury convicted him of
involuntary manslaughter.
   The Billionaire Boys Club was a nickname adopted by a group of
scions of some of Southern California's wealthiest families who
used their inheritances to bankroll risky investments.
   They were accused of a number of scams and murder plots,
including the 1984 death of Hedayat Eslaminia, a one-time close
associate of the Shah of Iran.
   Eslaminia suffocated, apparently accidentally, after he was
abducted from his Belmont condominium and stuffed inside a steamer
trunk for transport to Beverly Hills.
   Eslaminia's son, Reza, and another Billionaire Boy's Club
member, Arben Dosti, were convicted of murder and kidnapping for
extortion and conspiracy in the plot to kidnap the elder Eslaminia
for his money and then kill him. They were sentenced to life in
prison without parole.
   The club leader, Joe Hunt, was sentenced in July 1987 to life in
prison without parole in the slaying of Ronald Levin. Levin, who
had conned Hunt in a commodities investing deal, vanished in summer
1984. His body was never found.

   Here is a chronology of key events since Gen. Augusto Pinochet
took power in Chile:
   Sept. 11, 1973 _ The elected Marxist goverment of President
Salvador Allende is ousted by the military, headed by the commander
in chief of the Army, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Allende is believed to
have killed himself with a machine gun in the besieged presidential
palace when it became evident his government was falling. According
to official figures, 2,796 people die, 750 disappear, and thousands
are jailed.
   Dec. 17, 1974 _ Pinochet assumes the office of president. Under
his rule, congress is suspended under a state of siege. A crackdown
on leftists and dissidents is launched, earning Pinochet's
government a worldwide reputation for human rights abuses.
   Sept. 11, 1980 _ Voters approve a constitution providing for a
return to democracy after a minimum of eight years. The vote is
marred by opposition charges of massive fraud.
   March 11, 1981 _ The new constitution takes effect.
   Sept. 7, 1986 _ Pinochet survives an ambush by pro-Communist
guerrillas. Five bodyguards are killed.
   Oct. 5, 1988 _ Voters reject Pinochet's bid to extend his
authoritarian rule for eight more years, until 1997. The vote
clears the way for an open presidential election in December 1989.
Pinochet is to stay in office until the elections and the
installation of a new president.
   July 31, 1989 _ Chileans vote to approve a series of democratic
reforms to the 1980 constitution.
   Dec. 14, 1989 _ Voters elect presidential candidate Patricio
Aylwin, leader of the centrist Christian Democratic party. He is
backed by a coalition of 17 leftist and centrist parties.
   Dec. 21, 1989 _ Aylwin asks Pinochet to step down as commander
of the 60,000-member army, but the general refuses. His 1980
constitution gives Pinochet, now 74, the right to remain commander
for another eight years.
   Jan. 9, 1990 _ Aylwin names an 18-member Cabinet dominated by
centrists and moderates.
   March 11, 1990 _ Aylwin is inaugurated. Pinochet's critics and
supporters rally on his last day as president. He remains military
chief.

<TEXT>
   The executive director of the state
Democratic Party resigned one day after calling Republican Gov.
Carroll Campbell a fascist.
   Hap Connors said he resigned Saturday to ``take the heat off''
the state's senior Democrats, Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore and former
Gov. Dick Riley.
   ``It's unfair to put them in this spot,'' Connors said.
   State Republicans called Saturday for Theodore and Riley to
denounce Connor's comment. A message left at Theodore's home was
not returned and Riley's home telephone number is unlisted.
   A Campbell spokesman, Tucker Eskew, said he hoped the
resignation would ``close the book on a very unfortunate chapter in
South Carolina politics.''
   Connors' comment came after a state representative and four
county officials announced they were leaving the Democratic Party
for the GOP.
   ``I'll call him a fascist,'' Connors said of Campbell.
   He also criticized his opposite number in the state Republican
Party: ``I think Tony Denny, if he were a youth in the 1940s, he'd
be wearing a brown shirt,'' a reference to Fascist uniform styles.
   In November, Connors said Democratic Party members were shunning
Democratic state Sen. Theo Mitchell's run for governor not because
Mitchell is black, but because of Mitchell's 1982 indictment for
food stamp fraud.
   Party Chairman Frank Holleman, in announcing Connors'
resignation, said the Mitchell comments as well as those on
Campbell and Denny were occasions when Connors ``made statements
that did not represent the views of the Democratic Party.''
   Holleman also wrote Campbell and Denny to apologize for the
remarks.
   Connors said he was unsure what he would do now, but hoped to
``do something a little more creative.''

   Rain deluged parts of Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and
Arkansas on Sunday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue
flash flood watches across a broad region.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included nearly 2 inches at the Dallas and nearly 1{ inches at
Oklahoma City.
   Flash flood watches were in effect for parts of north-central
Texas, most of Oklahoma and parts of south-central and southeastern
Kansas.
   Meanwhile, cold rain extended across the upper Mississippi
Valley and the upper Great Lakes region, where temperatures were in
the 30s and 40s Sunday afternoon. Flash flood watches also were in
effect for northern Wisconsin, much of northern Iowa, parts of
southeastern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin.
   A cold front brought snow and gusty wind to much of the western
United States. Thunderstorms developing along the cold front
produced 4 inches of snow in two hours at Salt Lake City and 5
inches at Austin, Nev.
   A winter storm warning was in effect for western Utah and the
mountains of Utah.
   Up to 14 inches of snow was expected by Sunday night. Snow
advisories were posted for portions of Nevada, California's
northern Sierra Nevada, southeastern Idaho and areas of Wyoming and
Montana and parts of the Colorado Rockies.
   Strong and gusty winds were recorded in Arizona and California.
   Strong winds were blew across the Texas panhandle and in the
southwest corner of the state, where gusts reached 63 mph at
Guadalupe Pass.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed from the southern and
central Plains to the Atlantic coast.
   Temperatures were in the 60s in New England, in the 70s
throughout the Ohio Valley and into the 80s across Florida.
   The nation's low Sunday was 14 degrees at Lakeview, Ore.

   The second of two sons charged with
killing their millionaire parents at the family's mansion here
quietly surrendered Sunday to waiting police at Los Angeles
International Airport.
   Erik Menendez, 19, had arranged through his attorney to turn
himself over to detectives, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Bob
Curtis. He had been playing in a tennis tournament in Israel.
   ``It was a very low-key thing,'' said Curtis. ``They met him at
the airport and arrested him for the murder of his parents. ... I
don't even know how many people noticed what was going on.''
   Menendez and his brother, Lyle, are heirs to the $14 million
estate of Jose Menendez, 45, an executive of a Hollywood video
distribution company, Live Entertainment Inc.
   Menendez and his wife, Mary Louise ``Kitty'' Menendez, 44, were
shot to death Aug. 20 in their $5 million mansion. The sons
reported finding the bodies on returning from a night on the town.
   Lyle Menendez, 22, was arrested Thursday and held without bail
pending a Monday arraignment.
   Erik Menendez, arrested about 1 a.m., was booked and taken to
Los Angeles County Jail where he was held without bail.
   ``It was a voluntary surrender. Immediately upon being made
aware of the allegations against him, he made arrangements,'' said
Robert L. Shapiro, Menendez's attorney.
   His reaction to the murder charges ``is demonstrated by the fact
that he has voluntarily come back to this country,'' Shapiro said.
``It shows tremendous character and strength to immediately face
these allegations.''
   Curtis said police didn't try to have Menendez extradited from
Israel.
   Shapiro said he wasn't present at the airport when his client
was arrested, but had kept officers informed of the progress of the
flights, especially when there were delays in Europe.
   Curtis said he was uncertain whether court paperwork could be
done in time for Erik to be arraigned with his brother Monday.
   Criminal complaints were filed against both brothers last week
in Beverly Hills Municipal Court, charging them each with two
counts of homicide.
   Curtis said the arrest of the two brothers ends the search for
suspects in the case, but added the usual caution, ``We certainly
aren't closed to the possibility there are others.''
   Police have said two killers committed the crime, then picked up
ejected shell casings from the .12-gauge shotguns they used before
fleeing the scene.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that a friend found a
spent .12-gauge casing in one of Lyle's jackets, and it was held as
evidence.
   Police who served search warrants at a psychologist's office
Thursday also obtained tape recordings, apparently of counseling
sessions, which likely will be the subject of a court hearing for
their admissibility.

   The Bush administration urged the Soviet Union
on Sunday to ``respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania''
following the unanimous vote by the new Lithuanian parliament to
secede from the U.S.S.R.
   The White House, in a statement released shortly after the
dramatic vote in Vilnius, called upon Mikhail Gorbachev's
government to undertake ``immediate constructive negotiations''
with the government of the breakaway Baltic republic.
   The United States said it also ``expects the government of
Lithuania to consider the rights of its minority population.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in a written statement,
said:
   ``The United States has never recognized the forcible
incorporation of the independent states of Estonia, Latvia or
Lithuania into the U.S.S.R. We have consistently supported the
Baltic peoples' inalienable right to peaceful self-determination.
   ``The new parliament has declared its intention to restore
Lithuanian independence. The United States would urge the Soviet
government to respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania as
expressed through their freely elected representatives and expects
the government of Lithuania to consider the rights of its minority
population.''
   Fitzwater added: ``The United States believes it is in the
mutual interest of Lithuania, the Soviet Union and all CSCE
countries to resolve this issue peacefully. We call upon the Soviet
government to address its concerns and interests through immediate
constructive negotiations with the government of Lithuania. We hope
that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation or
encouragement of violence.''
   The CSCE is the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, also known as the Helsinki process. It includes all the
nations of Europe except Albania, and also the United States and
Canada.
   The Helsinki process, which produced pan-European agreements on
arms control and human rights, is now being looked to for helping
shape the new Europe in the wake of the dramatic shifts toward
democracy in the East Bloc states.
   The United States has never accepted the Soviet Union's
annexation of Lithuania and the other two Baltic states. The three
states were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Russia had ruled Lithuania in the 19th century, but Lithuania
had gained independence following World War II.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet president and communist party chairman,
had urged the Lithuanians not to secede, warning that it could
undermine his efforts to bring political and economic reforms to
the entire Soviet Union.
   A Lithuanian diplomat said Sunday that Western governments are
likely to wait to recognize Lithuania's declaration of independence
until its leaders resolve disputes with Moscow and establish
control over their country.
   Stasys Lozoraitis, charge d' affaires in Washington for
Lithuania, said U.S. officials had told him beforehand ``they want
to see the government take over effective control'' before formally
recognizing it.
   ``All Western powers are inclined to wait,'' the Lithuanian
diplomat said. But he predicted recognition could come ``after one
month or two.''
   Bush, like other American presidents before him, had reiterated
the U.S. refusal to recognize the Soviet Union's annexation of the
Baltic States.
   In an annual proclamation last June 14 declaring ``Baltic
Freedom Day,'' Bush said:
   ``Since their forcible annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940,
the people of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have suffered political
oppression, religious persecution and repression of their national
consciousness. Their cultural heritage has been denigrated and
suppressed, and Russification has threatened their survival as
distinct ethnic groups.
   ``However, half a century of repression has not broken the
spirit of the Baltic peoples. Today, their longing and hopes for
liberty remain strong,'' Bush said in the proclamation. ``The
future looks brighter today than at any other time in the Baltic
States' postwar experience.''

   A man apparently upset over divorce
proceedings walked into a church Sunday, shot his wife twice, then
turned the gun on himself as 55 churchgoers watched, authorities
said.
   The woman, Tawanna Jo Lynch, 32, was shot twice in the head and
was listed in critical condition at St. Anthony's Hospital in
Oklahoma City, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Her husband, David Leon Lynch, 31, was dead at the scene, he

   The shooting occurred at the Byng Freewill Baptist Church about
11 a.m., said Pontotoc County Undersheriff Jeff Glase.
   ``The family is going through a divorce. They split up a couple
of weeks ago,'' Glase said. ``There's been a little tension about
separating the property.''
   Glase said that ``with as many witnesses as we have, unless
something unusual develops it's a pretty open and shut case.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Sunday told
Communists to prepare to fight for political leadership in a
multiparty system and proposed rules that would increase autonomy
of local party bodies but fall short of key demands by reformers.
   He spoke to the party's policy-making Central Committee as it
met in the Kremlin on the fifth anniversary of Gorbachev's 1985
accession to power. It was also the eve of a special session of the
Soviet parliament that was expected to elect Gorbachev to a vastly
more powerful national presidency.
   In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, lawmakers Sunday night
declared the Baltic republic independent from the Soviet Union. But
there was no initial reaction to that bold move in state-run news
reports of the Central Committee meeting at the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev, who serves both as president and Communist Party
general secretary, asked the committee Sunday to formally propose
that the parliament, the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies,
revoke the party's legal monopoly on power fixed in Article 6 of
the constitution.
   At a meeting late last month, the party leadership agreed in
principle to that step. It would legalize a multiparty system
throughout the Soviet Union and force Communists to compete for
office in contested elections.
   The committee approved a proposal for the Congress on Article 6,
as well as on another constitutional provision that awards the
Komsomol Young Communist League, official trade unions and other
sanctioned organizations a special role in ``managing state and
public affairs,'' the official Tass news agency reported.
   Gorbachev proposed the party schedule a national congress for
July 2. He is expected to use the meeting to further transform the
party and weed out opponents of his campaign for ``perestroika,''
or economic and social restructuring.
   ``Of course, the fight for political leadership in the framework
of democratic procedures, of election campaigns will now become one
of the basic functions of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet
Union),'' Gorbachev told the Central Committee in remarks later
distributed by Tass.
   The 248 party leaders that Soviet television said attended the
closed-door meeting were given drafts of new party rules. Gorbachev
said the rules would guarantee grass-roots party organizations the
right to take independent approaches to problems and decide whom
they should admit as members. They could also keep up to 50 percent
of the party dues paid by members.
   But Gorbachev did not embrace demands by some Communist
reformers for abolishing city and regional party committees. They
customarily dominate local government authorities and grass-roots
party organizations alike.
   Gorbachev said the fate of Communist parties in Eastern Europe
showed the danger that arises when party organizations in cities
and regions are dissolved.
   Significantly, the Soviet leader also failed to endorse
mandatory election by rank-and-file Communists of delegates to the
July party congress, which reformers say is necessary to prevent
local party barons from imposing their slates.
   Gorbachev stressed that the party should be ``a union of
like-minded Communists.'' He thus ruled out the possibility that
factions would finally be admitted in party ranks in contrast to
the practice laid down by Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
   Likewise, the new rules would permit the creation of a
federalized party with independent organizations in the Soviet
republics, as some party reformers wanted, Gorbachev said.
   But he said the republic-level parties would be granted ``real
autonomy'' by the rules and a new party program that will be
submitted to the July congress for adoption.
   Radicals and reformers inside and outside the Communist Party
say that even if it is put on the same legal footing with other
groups, the party will retain its dominant role in Soviet life. It
does so through groups of Communists organized in government
agencies, farms, army units, police precincts and virtually every
other institution.
   Gorbachev repeated it was necessary for the July congress to
endorse a new role for the party that would get it out of running
day-to-day Soviet affairs. But he said party organizations based at
the workplace would remain.
   He also staked out a special position in society for the
Communist Party, even if its legal status is altered, as ``the
ruling party, politically responsible before the people,'' and one
that will not engage in ``trivial parliamentary games.''
   According to the Interfax news agency of state-run Radio Moscow,
the Central Committee will reconvene later in the week to nominate
its candidate for the new presidency, presumbly Gorbachev, after
the Congress of People's Deputies passes the constitutional
amendments creating the post.

   Only a few hours after its installation
Sunday, the Chilean government of President Patricio Aylwin
restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, East Germany,
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Foreign Minister Enrique Silva, who signed the documents during
separate ceremonies on behalf of Aylwin, said restoration of
diplomatic ties with Cuba ``is still under consideration.''
   Signing the documents for the Eastern European countries were
officials who arrived in Chile to attend the Aylwin inauguration
earlier Sunday in the port city of Valparaiso. They included two
vice preidents, Valt Komarek of Czechoslovakia and Borislav Jovic
of Yugoslavia.
   The East bloc countries broke relations with Chile immediately
after the 1973 coup in which Gen. Augusto Pinochet toppled
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   Silva did not explain why relations were not immediately
restored with Cuba. However, Aylwin has said that that will only
happen if the Communist regime of President Fidel Castro stops
supporting the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a pro-Communist
guerrilla group in Chile.

   The Lithuanian parliament voted Sunday
to break away from the Soviet Union and restore the independence
the Baltic republic lost when it was forcibly annexed by the
Kremlin 50 years ago.
   Legislators joined hands, raised them over their heads and
chanted ``Lietuva, Lietuva,'' or ``Lithuania,'' after they voted to
proclaim their homeland independent once more. The vote was 124-0
with six deputies abstaining.
   The move was not immediately recognized or sanctioned by Moscow,
and legislators acknowledged that full independence would only be
won after long, difficult negotiations with the Kremlin.
   The lawmakers also declared that the KGB and police now must
take their orders from Vilnius, not Moscow.
   Outside the parliament hall, a small crowd broke into wild
cheers over the declaration of independence. Earlier, the crowd
ripped down a metal Soviet crest from the outside door of the
legislative building and carted it away. Some stamped on it.
   ``That's the end of the Soviet regime,'' said a jubilant deputy
looking on.
   ``Expressing the will of the people, the Supreme Council of the
Republic of Lithuania decrees and solemnly declares the restoration
of the exercise of the sovereign powers of the Lithuanian state,
which were annulled by foreign force in 1940,'' said the
legislative decree.
   ``And from this moment, Lithuania again becomes a sovereign
state,'' it said.
   For Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the vote represented
perhaps his biggest crisis yet on his fifth anniversary as Soviet
leader and the eve of a national parliamentary session.
   The outgoing president of the Lithuanian parliament, Communist
Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas, said before the vote that approval
of secession could have a ``contagious effect'' on other republics.
   The would only add to Gorbachev's troubles, which already
include rumblings for independence elsewhere, and serious economic
problems and ethnic strife in many areas of the nation.
   Leaders of the pro-independence Sajudis political movement that
dominates the new Lithuanian legislature acknowledged that full
independence would have to be won in long, difficult negotiations.
   ``We have to sit down at the table,'' said the republic's new
president, Vytautas Landsbergis. ``We're not going to be beating
our fists, but we have to start settling accounts.''
   Landsbergis, the chairman of Sajudis, earlier Sunday was the
first non-communist to be elected president of a Soviet republic.
The bearded 57-year-old music professor easily defeated Brazauskas.
   At a news conference after the close of Sunday's session,
Landsbergis said talks with Moscow will start ``when the Soviet
government adopts an appropriate decision on that issue.''
   Lithuanians rushed to hold their session this weekend to
establish their claim to independence before the national
parliamentary session, which is expected to expand Gorbachev's
powers to include declaring a state of emergency in a republic and
suspending its parliament.
   However, Landsbergis told reporters: ``Perhaps the election of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the post of president of the Soviet Union
would make this problem easier and bring the date of the talks
nearer.''
   Gorbachev has told Lithuania that it will cost the republic $34
billion to pay for the factories and other infrastructure built
during a half-century of Soviet rule. Lithuanians say their bill
for decades of Soviet repression will be even higher.
   But Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have indicated the
Kremlin may grudgingly accept Lithuanian secession.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the session ``temporarily''
recognized independent Lithuania's 1938 constitution as the supreme
law of the land instead of the Soviet Constitution.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the United States will urge the Soviet goverment to ``respect the
will of the citizens of Lithuania.''
   ``The United States has never recognized the forcible
incorporation of the independent states of Estonia, Latvia or
Lithuania into the U.S.S.R. We have consistently supported the
Baltic peoples' inalienable right to peaceful self-determination,''
Fitzwater said.
   The Lithuania Supreme Soviet also changed the republic's name
from the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Republic of
Lithuania and dropped its Soviet emblem.
   The deputies stood, applauded and then broke into cheers as a
plain beige drape descended to cover a gold banner behind
Landsbergis depicting a Lithuanian crest that included a Soviet
hammer, sickle and star.
   They stood again as a former political prisoner in a traditional
embroidered shirt presented the new crest, a white knight on a dark
shield.
   Deputy Rolandas Paulauskas, a Sajudis editor from Kaunas, said
the declaration of independence would not change anything
immediately, but ``as a political act it gives a push to
negotiations.''
   He noted that Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov had
reportedly told Lithuanians he would not be willing to talk about
concessions concerning withdrawal of the Soviet Army until after
such a political gesture.
   Justus Paleckis, ideology secretary of Lithuanian Communist
Party, said Lithuania was assured of getting independence but
``real independence will only be achieved in some years.''
   Sajudis-backed candidates had won a two-thirds majority in the
first contested elections to the Baltic republic's 141-seat
legislature. Several of the seats were not filled, but
pro-independence activists decided not to wait for a full slate of
deputies to be present before they called the legislature into
session.
   Sajudis leaders decided it would be unfitting to re-elect
Brazauskas now that his Communists were in the minority, said
Sajudis activist Haroldas Subachius.
   Landsbergis received 91 votes for the presidency, with 42
against. Brazauskas got 38 votes, with 95 against.
   Brazauskas led Lithuanian Communists into splitting off from the
Soviet party in December and joining the drive for restoration of
the independence that the Ireland-sized state enjoyed between the
world wars.
   But he favored a more gradual approach to breaking relations
with Moscow.
   Lithuania, like the other independence-minded Baltic states of
Latvia and Estonia, was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in
1940 while under Red Army occupation.
   On Friday, the Georgian parliament passed a resolution
condemning the republic's annexation to the Soviet Union, mirroring
moves already made in the Baltics.

   An inmate killed when he tried to leave
the state prison with the garbage was a victim of a policy that
requires trucks to drive over refuse once it reaches the dump, a
spokesman said Sunday.
   ``Obviously, we don't want inmates to escape,'' said Nevada
State Prison spokesman Glen Whorton. ``Anybody who hides himself in
the trash is running that kind of risk. It's one way to protect the
public.''
   Whorton said the purpose of the policy is to ``disable''
escapees and discourage other inmates from escaping that way.
   The body of Willis Walton, 26, was discovered at the dump
Sunday. He apparently was crushed to death by the truck,
authorities said.
   Whorton said it also was possible that Walton's death may have
been caused by a bulldozer that subsequently moved the garbage and
covered it with dirt.
   Walton was serving a 19-year sentence for burglary and
possession of a controlled substance. He entered the prison in
September 1987.

   An empty petroleum storage tank at

worked on Sunday, killing the three men inside.
   The men were on a crew that was cutting the top off of the empty
tank when a piece of equipment apparently ignited vapors inside,
said Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Horton.
   Nearby residents said they heard what sounded like thunder,
looked out and saw fire and smoke in the air. The fire was very

   He was unable to identify the dead.

   Israel's Cabinet again failed to decide on a
response to U.S. peace proposals Sunday, and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir blamed the United States for upsetting peace efforts with
recent comments about the status of Jerusalem.
   An angry Vice Premier Shimon Peres left the nearly three-hour
session of the 12-member Inner Cabinet after Shamir refused to call
a vote and announced that a few more days of debate were needed.
   Peres, head of the center-left Labor Party, said he would seek a
free hand from his party to break up the coalition governmment.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, indicated he was
open to compromise and said he would fight any effort to bring down
the government.
   After nearly six months of dicussing U.S. proposals, Perez said
he viewed the lack of a decision as a rejection.
   ``What happened in the Cabinet today, no doubt, put an end to
the possibility of conducting the peace process ... and put an end
to the reason behind the National Unity Government,'' Peres said
after the session.
   His actions made it almost impossible for the 15-month-old
coalition government to continue without deciding soon whether to
accept U.S.-sponsored peace talks with Palestinians.
   Prominent Palestinians also expressed exasperation at Israeli
leaders who, for the second week in a row, failed to come to a
decision on whether to start a peace dialogue.
   Faisal Husseini, a prominent Palestinian who has been mentioned
as a possible negotiator, said: ``When they decide, yes or no, we
would have something to talk about. But a government that cannot
decide anything is just blocking the way.''
   After caucusing with Labor Cabinet ministers, Peres announced he
would ask the party's 1,300-member central committee Monday to
empower the 39 Labor members of Parliament to ``take the necessary
steps.''
   The wording indicated Peres was seeking a flexible mandate that
would give him room to coordinate a joint policy with Likud or vote
in favor of a no-confidence motion that would bring down the
government.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor leader who has favored
keeping the coalition together, said the burden was now on Likud to
come up with an acceptable solution.
   He noted he had proposed a compromise, which involved giving
Washington a positive answer and then hammering out an agreed
Labor-Likud position on outstanding issues.
   ``Now it is (Likud's) turn,'' he said. ``The way I see it is the
peace process is stuck.''
   Speaking on Israeli Television, Shamir chastised Peres for
seeking a ``hasty'' decision.
   ``What's the hurry? To break up the unity government which we
have built with such efforts? So what if the discussion takes
another day or week, will the world turn over?''
   Shamir added that he would try to block any Labor attempt to
form a narrow government.
   ``I shall try to convince parliament members and their parties
not to help Labor in achieving this goal, but to vote against them
if they try to bring down the government,'' he said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposals for an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting are meant to further Israel's proposal
for Palestinian elections as a step toward peace. The Israeli plan
was accepted in May.
   Shamir saved his harshest criticism for recent U.S. policy
statements by President Bush and other officials opposing the
settlement of Jews in the Arab sector of east Jerusalem, which
Israel annexed in 1967.
   ``I hear the voices coming today from Washington on the issue of
Jerusalem, things that enrage every Jew in Israel, and I have to
react, I have to consider it,'' said Shamir.
   Shamir also said the Bush administration was trying to involve
the Palestine Liberation Organization in negotiations. Israel views
the PLO as a terror organization.
   ``I think the Americans did not act correctly or properly in
their entire course of action related to the peace process,'' he
said.
   Aides said the U.S. statements were behind Shamir's insistence
that more debate and coordination with Labor is neccessary.
   Baker has made several proposals designed to get Palestinian and
Israelis to talks in Cairo. These include a suggestion that east
Jerusalem residents and exiled Palestinians be allowed into
negotiations.
   Labor accepted the U.S. ideas, but Shamir remains opposed. He
says participation of east Jerusalem residents would signal an
Israeli willingness to discuss yielding control over the Arab
sector, which the PLO wants as the capital of a Palestinian state.
   He also opposes having Palestinians who were deported from the
territories sitting in on the talks. He says this would implicitly
recognize the right of 3 million Palestinian refugees to return to
homes that are now part of Israel.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton and the state's
largest teachers union prepared for a Monday showdown. The union
refused to end its strike and Caperton warned that teachers who
stay off the job can be dismissed.
   State School Superintendent Hank Marockie called the 55 county
school superintendents to Charleston on Sunday to detail what he
said is their duty to punish teachers who continue the walkout.
Marockie said he would wait to see how many teachers return to work
Monday before deciding what action to recommend.
   Teachers are employed by county school boards, and it is up to
the county school superintendents to take any action against
striking teachers, including suspension or firing.
   ``The law's pretty clear,'' said Caperton, referring to a state
attorney general's ruling that the strike is illegal. ``County
superintendents will follow those rules and make it strict and the
consequences are pretty bad.''
   Meanwhile, the leaders of the two main teacher unions requested
a meeting with Caperton. WVEA President Kayetta Meadows said
communications between the governor's staff and her group have been
``distorted,'' leading to confusion about what has been offered by
both sides.
   ``I think it's time that we as leaders set aside our differences
and sit down and talk about the issues before this thing gets out
of hand,'' said Bob Brown, executive director of the West Virginia
Federation of Teachers.
   Gubernatorial spokesman G.C. Morse was out of his office and
unavailable for comment on the request.
   Late Saturday, the 16,000-member West Virginia Education
Association accused the governor of backing off a promise to call a
special legislative session to discuss pay if teachers returned to
work. Union officials sent word to county associations Sunday that
the walkout was still on.
   Caperton said the union's contention that he promised to call a
special session was ``a total lie.''
   The strike began Wednesday and by Friday had spread to 40 of the
state's 55 counties. Classes were canceled in 24 counties and
sharply curtailed in the rest.
   Teachers voted overwhelmingly Saturday to return to work under
several conditions, including that the governor call a special
session within 30 days.
   ``The essence of the problem is the ballot that we sent out was
very clear in stating, `Will you go back if the governor agrees to
all of the following?' and he didn't,'' union executive director
Dennis Giordano said Sunday.
   Gubernatorial spokesman G.C. Morse said Caperton would not agree
to a special session under the threat of a continued strike but
would consider one once the teachers returned.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins ruled last week that the strike
was illegal and said any teachers who walk off the job can be
suspended, fired, barred from teaching for a year and charged with
misdemeanors.
   Caperton on Friday recommended that striking teachers lose no
pay or benefits if they returned to work Monday, but he said that
offer won't be repeated if the strike continues.
   The West Virginia Federation of Teachers, with 3,000 members,
recommended Saturday that teachers end their strike but said the
decision was up to teachers in each county.
   The average West Virginia teacher salary of $21,904 ranks the
state 49th in the nation, the association says. Teachers received a
5 percent raise from that figure in February, but objected when the
governor provided no money in his 1990-91 budget for a further
raise.

   Cuban authorities rounded up seven political
activists, including a leading human rights advocate, in a
crackdown on dissent, sources said Sunday.
   Human rights groups have said there has been a general crackdown
over the past year on groups seeking greater political freedom in
communist Cuba.
   Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of the unsanctioned Pro-Human
Rights Party, was detained Saturday, 17 days after completing a
10-month prison, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He was among a group of activists sentenced to prison terms a
year ago for trying to organize a rally in support of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the Kremlin leader's visit to
Havana.
   Also among the seven detainees was Tania Diaz Castro, who was
released from prison last fall after serving a sentence for protest
activities.
   She is not related to President Fidel Castro.
   There was no immediate official confirmation of the latest
arrests.
   On two occasions last week, there were pro-government
demonstrations in front of the homes of rights activists who were
meeting with colleagues.

   Journalists, relatives and government leaders
appealed Sunday to Iraq to grant clemency to a London-based
journalist sentenced to death on espionage charges and to a British
woman ordered imprisoned for 15 years.
   A delegation of European Economic Community ambassadors went to
the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad to make a ``humanitarian appeal''
on behalf of Farzad Bazoft and Daphne Parish, the EEC said in a
statement.
   British Ambassador Harold Walker said he made a separate trip to
the ministry to deliver a personal appeal from Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain would also be talking
with its allies in the next few days ``to see what support they
will give us in pressuring the Iraqis.''
   King Hussein of Jordan, who met with Mrs. Thatcher on Sunday,
volunteered to see what he could do to help, according to
government sources quoted by Press Association, the British
domestic news agency. Hussein is believed to have good relations
with the Iraqi president.
   Bazoft, 31, was arrested in September and charged with spying
for foreign powers after making an unauthorized trip to a military
complex where a huge explosion had been reported. He was in Iraq on
an assignment for the The Observer, a London newspaper.
   Mrs. Parish, 52, a senior nursing administrator for an Irish-run
hospital in Baghdad, was accused of helping Bazoft by driving him
to the Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad. She was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Under Iraqi law, no court appeal is allowed against the
sentences. They were imposed by a revolutionary court Saturday
after a closed trial.
   There was no indication when Bazoft might be executed.
   Observer editor Donald Trelford said he delivered a letter to
the Iraqi Embassy on Sunday, calling on Ambassador Dr. Azmi
Al-Salihi to urge Hussein to commute the sentences.
   Trelford said he had a ``heated exchange'' with the embassy's
second-ranking official, whom he identified as Zuhir Ibrahim.
   ``He said that Farzad had taken soil samples from the military
site and was therefore not acting properly. I argued I had heard
nothing to suggest he had acted in any way other than as a
journalist,'' said Trelford.
   Reports in London said as many as 700 people were killed in an
explosion at the complex. The Iraqis later said 19 people were
killed in a fuel depot blast.
   About 50 of Bazoft's friends and colleagues gathered outside the
Iraqi Embassy, as did Michelle de Vries, the 21-year-old daughter
of Mrs. Parish.
   ``Only two weeks ago I got a letter from the Iraqis saying the
trial would be fair, which it has obviously not been,'' Miss de
Vries said.
   Trelford said he stressed the innocence of both Bazoft and Mrs.
Parish and requested that a representative of the newspaper be
allowed to visit Bazoft.
   ``Farzad has no immediate family so his colleagues at the
Observer are his family and we are asking to see him as members of
a family should be allowed to,'' Trelford said.
   Bazoft is an Iranian exile who has lived in Britain since 1975
and travels on British documents.
   The British ambassador said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio interview the Iraqi Foreign Ministry assured him Mrs.
Thatcher's appeal ``would be passed on as a matter of urgency.''
   He said the EEC delegation, consisting of the ambassadors of
Ireland, France and Italy, and acting on behalf of all 12 member
nations, was told the same thing.

   A strong earthquake with a preliminary reading of
5.5 on the Richter scale hit islands in the Pacific Ocean south of
Tokyo early Monday, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   There was no danger of tsunami, or tidal waves triggered by
undersea disturbances such as earthquakes, according to the agency.
Nor were there any reports of deaths, injury or damage, the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police Department said.
   The agency said the epicenter of the quake, which occurred at
7:59 a.m., was about six miles under the seabed 180 miles south of
Tokyo.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy an earthquake
releases. Each increase of one number on the scale means the ground
motion is 10 times greater; a measurement of 5 can cause
considerable damage and 6 severe damage.

   Gen. Augusto Pinochet surrendered the
government to elected President Patricio Aylwin on Sunday, ending
16{ years of military rule and completing South America's
transition to civilian government.
   However, Pinochet remains chief of the 60,000-member army,
despite a request from Aylwin that he give up that powerful post.
   Street celebrations of the partial return of democracy touched
off scattered disturbances in downtown Santiago. Bands of leftist
youths blocked streets with burning debris and clashed with police.
More than 20 people were reported injured.
   To thunderous applause and cheers, Aylwin put on the red, white
and blue presidential sash in the inaugural ceremony in Valparaiso,
a seaport city 70 miles northwest of Santiago.
   ``Chile returns to democracy without violence, without blood,
without hate,'' he later told supporters in Santiago. ``Chile
returns by the road of peace.''
   Aylwin's first official act was to pardon all political
prisoners under the Pinochet regime.
   Pinochet shook the new president's hand at the inauguration and
then quickly left the hall, where his entrance brought competing
chants of ``Pinochet! Pinochet!'' and ``Murderer! Murderer!'' from
the galleries.
   Upon the 74-year-old Army general's arrival for the ceremony, a
group of protesters tossed tomatoes, stones and other objects at
Pinochet's open-top limosine and shouted insults.
   The car, surrounded by military bodyguards, momentarily sped up.
It bumped into a soldier on horseback, but no injuries were
reported.
   A military band saluted Pinochet as he left the ceremony, held
in a half-finished congressional palace being built to house an
elected senate and house of deputies, which also assumed power
Sunday. Under Pinochet, a military junta had acted as the
legislature.
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old centrist politician, won elections in
December. A Christian Democrat, he is backed by a coalition of 17
centrist and leftist parties.
   He has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil
liberties and put more emphasis on social services for the poor.
But he plans no major changes in Pinochet's largely successful
free-market economic program.
   Sunday evening, Aylwin stood on the balcony of the presidential
palace in Santiago and urged Chileans to put aside differences and
unite behind democracy.
   Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Chileans lined the route into
Santiago from Valparaiso to cheer Aylwin's motorcade. They packed
the square in front of the presidential palace, waving banners and
chanting anti-Pinochet slogans.
   Just before Aylwin spoke, some celebrants broke through a police
line beside the palace, and police scattered them with tear gas.
First-aid workers at a nearby hotel treated three people
overwhelmed by the gas and one man who was bleeding from the head,
according to witnesses.
   As evening approached, people clashed with police up and down
the capital's main boulevard. Authorities used tear gas and water
cannons.
   Several people were seen bleeding or otherwise hurt, and local
radio stations reported about 20 people injured. Police hauled off
some protesters, but a police spokesman said he had no total for
arrests.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election when voters, in a 1988
referendum, rejected an extension of his rule to 1997.
   A clause in the 1980 constitution, written by Pinochet's
administration, bars any new president from replacing him as army
commander before 1998. Aylwin's term ends in 1994.
   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, ending a long
democratic tradition in Chile. He toppled the elected government of
President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist, during a period of
economic and social turmoil.
   The general began his last morning as president by receiving
Vice President Dan Quayle at his home in eastern Santiago for a
30-minute private meeting.
   Pinochet supporters outside booed and jeered Quayle. ``Gringo,
understand, Chile isn't for sale,'' some chanted. Others held up
signs saying, ``Go Home.''
   Pinochet has bitterly criticized the United States for
supporting the push for democracy in Chile and for cutting off
weapons sales to Chile in 1976 because of systematic human rights
violations.
   The arms embargo was proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who came to Chile with Quayle and attended the
inauguration. The embargo remains in effect.
   ``This is the dawn of a new era,'' Quayle said in Valparaiso.
``Democracy is here. We hope it is here to stay.''
   ``I'm proud of what the Chilean people have done,'' Kennedy said.
   Chile is the last in a series of South American countries to
restore elected civilian rule in the last decade, ending the
dominance of authoritarian military leaders.
   Also in Chile for the inauguration was Joyce Horman, the widow
of Charles Horman. He was an American free-lance journalist whose
arrest and slaying during the 1973 coup inspired the movie
``Missing.''
   According to the family and testimony collected by human rights
groups, Horman was among many suspected dissidents held and
executed at Santiago's National Stadium. The military government
has denied the allegations.
   Mrs. Horman of New York was invited by the new government and
was expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration.
   In his first act as president, Aylwin decreed a pardon for all
``prisoners of conscience'' jailed by the Pinochet government.
   About 450 people are imprisoned for politically related crimes,
although most are charged in connection with guerrilla activity.
Aylwin has said he opposes freeing anyone guilty of blood crimes,
and it was not immediately clear whom the pardon would affect.
   As the change in government was taking place, many foreign heads
of state were arriving _ having delayed their visits until
Pinochet's rule was formally ended. They included presidents Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Alan Garcia
of Peru, and prime ministers Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and Giulio
Andreotii of Italy.
   In Santiago, thousands of Pinochet supporters lined a two-mile
stretch to bid him farewell before he attended a final military
mass and flew off to the Valparaiso ceremony.
   ``You will return,'' many chanted. Some wept openly. The crowds
repeatedly surged through police lines trying to touch the general,
who was in an open car.
   The crowd grabbed and punched reporters accompanying Pinochet,
who repeatedly has accused the press of unfairly attacking his rule
and exaggerating human rights abuses.
   In Santiago, small bombs were tossed from moving taxis at or
near the homes of three military officers, police said. Only minor
damage was reported, and no one claimed responsibility for the
attacks.
   Leftist extremist groups have operated in Chile for years, but
it is widely speculated that many of the attacks attributed to them
are carried out by right-wing organizations trying to dramatize the
leftist threat.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, after
receiving an unfriendly welcome from supporters of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, said Sunday the outgoing military ruler assured him he
would obey Chile's new civilian government.
   Quayle, meeting with Pinochet on the last day of his 16{-year
presidency, quoted Pinochet as saying ``there would be no problems
between himself and President (Patricio) Aylwin _ when President
Aylwin gave an order, that order would be complied with.''
   Quayle was jeered by a throng of Pinochet supporters when he
arrived for a 35-minute meeting at the general's walled residence.
   ``Go Away!'' they shouted. ``Son of a Whore!'' and ``Pinochet,
Pinochet!''
   Quayle waved to them as he got out of his limousine, apparently
unaware that their shouts were unfriendly.
   There was no violence, but Secret Service agents canceled plans
for Quayle to hold a sidewalk news conference near the
demonstrators. Following the Pinochet meeting, the agents spirited
him away in his limousine as the crowd booed and made thumbs-down
gestures.
   Meanwhile, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega, who arrived in
Santiago Sunday night, said he would like to meet with Quayle while
here. `I think it will be a good opportunity to talk with Vice
President Quayle,'' he said at a news conference when asked his
reaction to Quayle's previous statements that he was willing to
hold such a meeting.
   Until Ortega was voted out of office Feb. 25 and agreed to turn
over power to his successor, Quayle and other Bush administration
officials had avoided direct high-level talks with the Ortega
government although the two maintained formal diplomatic relations.
   Quayle's chief of staff, Bill Cristol, attended the Ortega news
conference and said: ``I suspect they'll (Quayle and Ortega) have a
chance to talk one way or the other. We'll what happens tomorrow.''
   Both men are scheduled to attend a luncheon Monday being hosted
by Aylwin for all the visiting government officials.
   Pinochet still heads the Chilean military, and Quayle aides said
the vice president told Pinochet the United States expected him to
respect the new civilian authority. Pinochet has said he would
honor Aylwin's authority but has indicated he would not necessarily
consider other government officials his superiors.
   ``There was no debate. He knew who the people elected. He was
willing to abide by the wishes of the people. I found that most
encouraging,'' Quayle told reporters later.
   The vice president traveled to Valparaiso for Aylwin's
inauguration later in the day on the third day of his South
American trip.
   Quayle said he emphasized to Pinochet that ``his role in history
is just beginning to be recorded.''
   How he complies with the peaceful transition of government is as
important to Pinochet's historical legacy, Quayle said, as the
years of his presidency when widespread right-wing terror prevailed.
   Pinochet's regime came under increasing U.S. pressure to respect
human rights and was subjected to a U.S. embargo on military aid
and sales.
   U.S. officials traveling with Quayle said that, unlike most of
the foreign representatives who came for Aylwin's inauguration,
Quayle and the Bush administration had no qualms about a
face-to-face meeting with Pinochet.
   Several other heads of state arranged go directly to the
inaugural ceremony so they would not have to greet Pinochet. That
included Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez and Spanish
Prime Minister Philipe Gonzalez, both of whom Quayle met Friday in
Venezuela en route to Santiago.
   But Quayle said Sunday morning that ``the right thing is to pay
respects to the current president.''
   U.S. officials who participated in Sunday's meeting described
Pinochet as proud and unapologetic about the past but accepting of
the election that brought his 16-year rule to an end.
   Pinochet wore a white military jacket and waved briefly from his
balcony to his cheering fans.
   ``He was a very proud man. He's proud of what he's done for the
people of Chile,'' Quayle said.
   Pinochet began the meeting by comparing himself to the reformers
who are bringing democratic-style government to in Eastern Europe.
``Sixteen years ago, we did what is happening in Europe now. We
weren't understood. What is happening with the Berlin Wall _ that
happened to us 16 years ago,'' Pinochet said while posing for
photographers prior to the Quayle meeting.
   Pinochet overthrew the elected government of Marxist President
Salvador Allende in 1973. Thousands of Allende's supporters were
rounded up and many were tortured or killed. Victims of the human
rights abuses have vowed to press charges against the military once
Aylwin takes office.
   A senior official traveling with Quayle said the disposition of
those matters would be up to Chilean authorities.
   The Bush administration has emphasized human rights issues
abroad, but ``we didn't come here to debate the last 17 years,''
the official said.
   However, Quayle and the other U.S. officials with him said the
administration hopes to see progress under Aylwin on the
prosecution in the 1976 assassination in Washington of Orlando
Letelier, a former Allende cabinet minister. The U.S. government
has pressed unsuccessfully for the prosecution of two Chilean
military officers in that bombing.
   Quayle said, however, that issue did not arise in his meeting
with Pinochet.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The opposition said Sunday it
believes the military will yield power to a civilian-led
government, but it threatened a general strike if ousted ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril stays in Haiti.
   At least 24 people had been killed in the seven days of protests
and clashes that have left the government of this Caribbean nation
in turmoil. Haiti remained under interim military control Sunday,
the day after Avril's resignation.
   Soldiers firing from a speeding truck killed five people Sunday,
radio report said. Elsewhere in the capital, news photographers
said they saw police officers fatally shoot a young passer-by on a
street and then prevent witnesses from trying to save his life.
   The state hospital reported treating 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the past two days.
   Opposition politicians, meanwhile, sought guarantees from a
caretaker administration that there would be a transition to
democratic rule with early elections for a civilian government.
   Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, has been
ruled mainly by force of arms since it gained independence from
France in 1804, and it would be the first time in its history that
the civilian opposition has ruled.
   Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff, assumed
control after Avril stepped down Saturday. He promised to yield
power within 72 hours to a panel led by a civilian president that
would organize elections for October.
   Avril, 52, was said to be at his home in suburban
Port-au-Prince. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said Avril might leave the country in a matter of days.
   Unity Assembly, a coalition of 11 opposition parties and one
civic group that was influential in Avril's downfall, had
threatened an ``unlimited total paralysis of the country'' unless
Avril resigned by Monday.
   At a news conference Sunday, the group issued a statement
expressing confidence that Abraham would give up power.
   However, it called Avril a ``public danger'' and said it would
not lift the strike call until the ousted leader left Haiti.
   ``The French and U.S. embassies say the matter of Avril's
departure is settled, but only popular pressure will force him
out,'' said business leader Antoine Izmery, a Unity Assembly member.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the U.S. and French embassies, the Roman Catholic Church
and opposition political parties.
   He had been in power 18 months. His resignation marked the
Caribbean nation's fifth change of government since February 1986,
when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled into exile in France
and ended the 29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family.
   Thousands of people streamed into the streets Saturday to
celebrate Avril's downfall, but scattered violence soon broke out.
Roving gangs of youths reportedly ransacked the homes of at least
three prominent sympathizers of the Avril and Duvalier regimes.
   Early Sunday, soldiers in a speeding pickup truck opened fire on
pedestrians in downtown Port-au-Prince, killing five people, and
then removed the bodies, independent Radio Metropole said.
   Later, the radio station said Army Maj. Renaud St. Bert was
killed in a lottery booth in the suburb of Delmas. The report gave
no details of the killing but said soldiers fired into the air to
disperse a crowd there.
   Four people reportedly were killed last week in clashes with
security forces. Radio reports Saturday said soldiers killed eight
youths who attacked the home of a special police agent in suburban
Port-au-Prince.
   Opposition politicians complained of the violence in the
capital. They called for neighborhood self-defense groups to
protect people from marauding gunmen.
   The opposition was at odds with the army over who would be named
provisional president.
   The army's choice was Supreme Court President Gilbert Austin,
63, who said Saturday he expected to be appointed. Austin was
appointed chief justice by Avril last year after serving as the
general's justice minister.
   But Unity Assembly rejected him Sunday. It believes he has been
too much under Avril's influence. The group has favored the court's
vice president, Gabriel Volcy, but he is 74 and ill.
   The new president is to appoint a Cabinet approved by an
11-member advisory council made up of representatives of the Roman
Catholic Church, civic, human rights and opposition groups, and one
member of the army.
   United Assembly did not name an alternative choice for
president. But conservative politician Gerard Philippe-Auguste
said: ``Our first priority is a new provisional head of state. We
don't have a government yet. When we do, we will tackle the problem
of elections.''
   Speculation that Avril might be on his way out began growing
Monday after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently
accidentally during a demonstration. The killing set off violent
anti-government protests across the country.
   Avril came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections in October. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in January on government critics made clear that
Avril intended instead to make himself a dictator.
   After Jean-Claude Duvalier went into exile in 1986, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, Duvalier's army chief of staff
and Avril's predecessor.
   A first election attempt in November 1987 was called off after
thugs killed at least 34 voters. In January 1988, Leslie Manigat, a
university professor, was elected president, but most opposition
leaders refused to participate. Five months later, Namphy deposed
him.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Disciplined for Letting Tape Play in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor has been suspended without
pay for two weeks for making public a secretly recorded tape that
featured a reputed mobster boasting of bribing government
officials, a newspaper reported.
   The tape, played in a Feb. 9 federal court detention hearing,
sent several politicians scrambling to deny any wrongdoing. No
charges have been filed against any of the officials named in the
tape.
   The U.S. Justice Department suspended Jeffrey M. Johnson, a
17-year veteran prosecutor and an organized crime specialist with
the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, at the request of acting
U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing
unidentified sources. The suspension began Monday, the paper said.
   Raphaelson refused to acknowledge the suspension, and David
Runkel, a spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
said he had no knowlege of it, the Tribune reported Saturday.
   Neither Johnson nor Raphaelson returned telephone calls from the
Associated Press on Sunday.
   The tape, played at a detention hearing for five alleged
mobsters, was recorded Sept. 14 by an alleged
bookie-turned-government informant who was wearing a recording
device. Featured on the tape was Rocco Infelise, a reputed crime
syndicate gambling boss.
   Infelise spoke on the tape of making payoffs to law enforcement
officials and influencing the last Chicago mayoral race. He also
said he had been making $35,000 in payoffs to police and officials
each month, including $10,000 a month to the sheriff's office
through somebody called the Bohemian.
   An IRS agent said in court that the informant, William Jahoda,
who was also indicted, had identified the Bohemian as James Dvorak,
a former top aide in the Cook County sheriff's office and still
chairman of the Cook County GOP.
   Dvorak, as well as others named in the tape, denied the
accusations.
   Infelise and others who were subjects of the detention hearing
were among 20 people charged in indictments alleging that violence
and threats were used to run a gambling operation.
   Raphaelson asked for the suspension after Dvorak complained to
government officials that the tape cast him in an unfair light and
lent credence to Infelise's boasts, the Tribune said. Dvorak denied
he had anything to do with the suspension.
   Infelise had also boasted on the tape that he helped Chicago
Mayor Richard M. Daley win election last year by discouraging
campaign contributions to a Daley opponent. Daley dismissed the
statement as a fabrication.

   A weary Nelson Mandela dined with
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi Sunday before heading to Sweden, the
last stop on a five-nation tour to visit supporters of his movement
for black majority rule of South Africa.
   Mandela, 71, was to take a late-night flight from this East
African capital to Stockholm.
   Visibly tired, Mandela was seen by doctors Saturday evening in
the Tanzanian town of Morogoro, home to about 2,500 South African
refugees and a school and training camp run by his African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   ``He's no longer a 41-year-old,'' Solly Rathabe, an ANC
spokesman, said Sunday. ``He was tired, and we called doctors to
check him. He's not sick; he's just tired.''
   Rathabe denied reports that Mandela would shorten his visit to
Sweden, where he will visit ANC president Oliver Tambo, who is
being treated for a stroke he suffered late last year. Rathabe said
Mandela will remain there a full five days ``and might even extend
his stay.''
   A Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week that Mandela
planned to cut short his visit. The Swedish National News Agency
attributed the reported move to his concern over recent violence in
South Africa's black homelands that has taken more than 200 lives.
   Mandela was named deputy president of the ANC shortly after his
release last month after 27 years in South African prisons.
   With Tambo ill, the appointment made Mandela the virtual head of
the ANC, the leading group in the fight against South Africa's
white government and its policies of racial discrimination.
   On his last day of a six-day visit in Tanzania, Mandela toured
the ANC's Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College in Morogoro, named for
an ANC guerrilla executed in 1979. He then flew by helicopter to
Dar es Salaam, where he had a private dinner with the president.
   Since being freed by South African President F.W. de Klerk on
Feb. 11, Mandela has kept an exhausting schedule. His current trip
has also taken him to Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia for public
rallies and conferences with government and African leaders.

   Space shuttle Atlantis, strapped to the
back of a Boeing 747 for a return trip to Florida was grounded at
Biggs Army Airfield Sunday because of storms, officials said.
   The piggyback plane and shuttle landed here at 12:15 MST, after
taking off from Edwards Air Force Base, 60 miles north of downtown
Los Angeles, at 9:02 a.m. PST.
   Storms across the South forced posponement of the rest of the
trip, and NASA officials said they would decide Monday when the
shuttle could continue its return trip to Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.
   Atlantis touched down at Edwards on Wednesday, completing a
secret four-day, 10-hour military mission that included the release
of a $500 million spy satellite. It reportedly will be able to
deliver high-resolution photographs and eavesdrop on communications.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for April 12 when Discovery
is to begin a five-day mission to deploy the $1.55 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   Atlantis' next flight in space is another Defense Department
mission, set for July 9.

<TEXT>
   An aide to a leading presidential
candidate killed by drug traffickers claimed victory Sunday in
primary elections for the governing Liberal Party's presidential
nomination.
   No official results were released Sunday night but all five of
Cesar Gaviria's political rivals conceded defeat in the nation's
first presidential primary.
   The election and others for federal, state and local office
followed a night of political violence that left six people dead. A
leftist guerrilla from a group trying to disrupt the elections was
killed Sunday, military officials said.
   In the capital, Bogota, the leader of a leftist group that laid
down its arms this week won a surprising 9 percent of the vote in
the mayor's race, according to an exit poll.
   Gaviria, 43, won more than 58 percent of the votes cast in the
race for the centrist Liberal Party presidential nomination, a wide
margin over his rivals, according to an exit poll of 150,000
Colombians conducted by the RCN radio network.
   ``This backing from the Colombian people makes me very happy,''
Gaviria told reporters at his Bogota campaign headquarters. ``I
never thought I would win by such a wide margin.''
   Gaviria faces the opposition Conservative candidate, Rodrigo
Lloreda, in the May 27 presidential elections.
   Party leaders previously selected the Liberal Democratic
presidential candidate at a closed convention. Lloreda was chosen
at a Conservative Party convention in November.
   About 13.8 million Colombians, 18 years or older, were eligible
to vote Sunday.
   Colombians elected all 313 members of the nation's bicameral
legislature, 9,042 city councilmen, 1,009 mayors, and 421 state
assembly members. There were a total of 1,009 polling districts.
   The National Voting Registry did not release vote counts but
said preliminary results indicated the Liberal Party would mantain
its majority in both the House and the Senate. The party previously
held 67 of the 114 Senate seats and 111 of the 199 House seats.
   RCN said late Sunday that its count from regional election
boards showed Gaviria winning 60.1 percent of the early vote,
403,611 to 671,478 for his rivals. Gaviria's closest opponent,
Ernesto Samper, received 123,917 votes, or 18.45 percent, according
to the RCN compilation.
   Gaviria, an economist by training, was managing the presidential
campaign of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan when the candidate was killed by
drug traffickers on Aug. 18.
   ``This was Luis Carlos Galan's victory,'' Gaviria declared late
Sunday.
   The assassination touched off a war between Colombian drug lords
and the U.S.-backed government of President Virgilio Barco.
   Barco cannot run for re-election under the constitution. The
presidential term is four years.
   Gaviria decided to seek the Liberal Party's nomination several
weeks after Galan was killed and pledged to carry out Galan's
reform platform if elected. He has also promised to carry out
Barco's anti-drug campaign.
   Gaviria is associated in the minds of many Colombians with a
campaign to open the country's political system to more
participation by the masses.
   The only fatal incident during the elections occurred when
police shot and killed a member of the leftist National Liberation
Army in the southeastern town of Puerto Nidia, said Gen. Nelson
Mejia, the commander of the country's armed forces.
   Leftist guerrillas attacked voting booths in at least six towns
and prevented balloting in four towns, Mejia said in a radio
interview.
   The National Liberation Army has carried on a campaign of
violence in the last two months to disrupt elections in several of
the country's rural regions.
   Late Saturday, members of the rebel group assassinated two
police officers guarding voting precincts in Chaparral, a town 125
miles south of Bogota, according to Tolima state police.
Nevertheless, elections went ahead in the town without further
incident, according to RCN.
   In his campaign for the presidential nomination, Gaviria
supported Barco's anti-drug war. But he indicated that his
administration, after reforming the country's judicial system, may
try traffickers in Colombia rather than extradite them to the
United States.
   Barco's administration has extradited 14 drug suspects since it
intensified a campaign against the country's cocaine cartels
following Galan's death.
   Traffickers responded with 262 terrorist attacks, mostly
bombings, that killed 209 people.
   They called a unilateral truce in the drug war on Jan. 17 and
have said they are willing to surrender their illicit business and
themselves if the government scraps its extradition policy and
promises to try them in Colombia.
   Barco, aware that traffickers have been able to evade Colombian
justice by bribing and killing judges, has publicly refused to
include the policy in any negotiations.
   The Liberal Party's candidate for mayor of Bogota, Juan Martin
Caicedo, was expected to recapture the capital's top post from the
Conservative Party, according to preliminary results.
   Former leaders of a leftist guerrilla group _ April 19 Movement,
or M19 _ campaigned in many races Saturday hours after signing a
treaty with the government that ended their 16-year insurgency. RCN
said Carlos Pizarro, the leader of the group, won 9 percent of the
vote in the Bogota mayor's race.
   The Liberals were expected to lose mayor's races to the
Conservative Party in two other cities, Cali and Barranquilla,
according to the RCN exit poll. Cali is home to Colombia'
second-largest cocaine cartel.
   According to preliminary results, a majority of voters approved
a non-binding referendum to call a convention to reform the
country's constitution. Changes would be aimed at increasing
political participation through voting reform and reducing
political patronage.

   The chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee on Sunday called for a one-year government spending
freeze _ including Social Security benefits _ and new taxes on
gasoline, alcohol, tobacco and the wealthy.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said his proposal would reduce
the federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars over the
next five years, producing slight government surpluses in 1994 and
1995.
   Just in fiscal 1991, which begins next October, Rostenkowski
said his package would cut the deficit from $161 billion as
projected by the Congressional Budget Office to $106 billion. The
next year, the deficit would fall to $39 billion under his
proposal, instead of $124 billion as projected by the CBO, he said.
   Rostenkowski estimated the 1991 spending freeze alone _
including no cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, in Social
Security and other programs except those covering the very poor _
would save $105 billion over five years.

Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, indicated he was open

   Brash and sometimes bumbling criminals
have staged a rash of bank robberies in Ohio's capital city and its
suburbs.
   The Columbus area, with a population of about 1.2 million, has
had 42 bank robberies this year, more than Chicago, Detroit,
Pittsburgh and Cleveland combined.
   ``Why are there so many bank robberies? Frankly, right now we

   Authorities suspect many of the robbers are down-and-out drug

   The sheriff of this mountain county says
he's stopped the old custom of giving away seized moonshine for
home remedies since his arrest, even though a grand jury has
refused to indict him.
   ``I ain't done nothing nobody else had done,'' said Madison
County Sheriff Dedrick Brown, who was arrested after giving friends
six half-gallon jars of ``white lightning'' in front of a state
investigator.
   His supporters, including Republican Gov. Jim Martin, say the
practice dates back a century or more and his arrest was
politically motivated. The arrest was made by agents of the State
Bureau of Investigation, which is headed by a Democrat.
   Not everyone in Madison County agrees, however, with the grand
jury's decision not to indict Brown on charges of destroying
criminal evidence.

   The Lithuanian parliament voted Sunday
to break away from the Soviet Union and restore the independence
the Baltic republic lost when it was forcibly annexed by the
Kremlin 50 years ago.
   Legislators joined hands, raised them over their heads and
chanted ``Lietuva, Lietuva,'' or ``Lithuania,'' after they voted to
proclaim their homeland independent once more. The vote was 124-0
with six deputies abstaining.
   The move was not immediately recognized or sanctioned by Moscow,
and legislators acknowledged that full independence would only be
won after long, difficult negotiations with the Kremlin leadership.
   But outside the parliament hall, a small crowd broke into wild
cheers. Earlier, the crowd ripped down a metal Soviet crest from
the outside door of the legislative building and carted it away.
Some stamped on it.

<TEXT>
   Two months into their switch from
communism to capitalism, Poles have more to buy with less money,
inflation and production are down and unemployment is up. That's
just as expected, the planners say.
   Deputy Premier Leszek Balcerowicz, who devised the program, said
there were no surprises so far and his assistants in the Finance
Ministry agreed.
   ``I can see absolutely no reason why we should change our
policy,'' Marek Dabrowski, undersecretary of finance, told the
government newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
   On Jan. 1, the Solidarity-led government put an economic plan
into effect that involved a sharp initial increase in prices,
holding down wages, devaluing the currency and making it
convertible, and stopping subsidies and easy loans to state
enterprises.
   Its first stage is intended to make prices realistic and bring
inflation of 700 percent a year under control with a tight money
policy.
   In the second stage, the goal is to reform the economy, now 80
percent state-owned. This would be accomplished by forcing
inefficient companies to shape up or close, selling state concerns
to private owners, breaking up monopolies, and removing barriers to
free enterprise.
   When the plan took effect, coal prices rose 600 percent
overnight, electricity 400 percent, gasoline 200 percent and food
100 percent to 200 percent.
   Costs of food, manufactured goods and services continued to
climb until late January as the higher prices of energy and raw
materials were passed on.
   Figures for January showed average prices up nearly 79 percent
from December.
   Communist governments had raised prices, but none was as
successful in holding down wages. Families had to adjust instantly
to what the government statistics office said was a 43 percent
decline in real incomes in January.
   By the program's third week, a fundamental change became
evident. Prices reached levels at which consumers were unable or
unwilling to buy goods.
   Suddenly, there were no more lines at gas stations. Getting a
table in a restaurant was easy, and international telephone lines
were open more frequently.
   Furniture stores, empty before, filled with merchandise. Butcher
shops were full of sausages and a bicycle could be bought without
waiting weeks.
   Stores cut back orders because of full inventories. Producers
became desperate for cash.
   There were no more subsidies or government bailouts and the new
loan rates were too high. Producers and manufacturers started to
bypass the middleman and sell directly to the public.
   Trucks loaded with meat, eggs, butter, sugar, shoes, clothes,
plumbing supplies, TVs and other products now park outside stores
and markets.
   After decades of rudeness from employees of state stores,
consumers welcome the competition for their trade.
   ``I prefer to buy here because I can at least choose and
complain if I don't like a piece,'' said Krystyna Wilczyk, shopping
at a meat truck outside the Hala Mirowska market.
   Partly in response to low prices on the trucks, food stores
began cutting prices. The price of an egg had risen to the
equivalent of 6 cents, but soon fell to 3 cents.
   Many people still prefer the trucks. ``Even if it's not that
much cheaper anymore, at least you know it's fresh,'' Jolanta
Budzak said outside the Hala Mirowska market.
   Some stores are having sales, a Western phenomenon new to
Poland. A major department store introduced another novelty,
letting customers pay in installments.
   Inflation is dropping from its peak in late January. Wojciech
Misiag, another undersecretary of finance, told reporters March 2
that prices rose only about 1 percent a week in February and
similar figures were expected for March.
   Deputy Premier Balcerowicz wrote cautiously in mid-February:
``We are relatively close to the goal of suppressing inflation, but
it is too early for fanfares. It is necessary to keep the harsh
rules ... in force.''
   Tight money and slow sales have squeezed manufacturers. Unsold
merchandise is backing up in their warehouses.
   Government figures indicate production fell in January and
February. The slowdown is being reflected in worker layoffs.
   Unemployment was virtually unknown under Communist rule, but
55,000 workers were registered as jobless in January and more than
152,000 in February.
   Benefits for 400,000 unemployed were budgeted under the new
program, but the government now says the number may surpass 1.7
million in a work force of about 18 million.
   Lowered production has been criticized, but manufacturers and
farmers say they cannot maintain output without lower-cost loans.
   Although the government says easing up now would invite renewed
inflation, Balcerowicz said in a recent interview: ``While some
recession was inevitable and we expected it, we must defend
ourselves from a really deep recession.''
   Another criticism, voiced by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, is
that Balcerowicz has been too slow in converting the economy to
private ownership. Legislation to accomplish the conversion has
been written and will go to Parliament soon.
   The government has devalued the zloty by 38 percent, to 9,500 to
the dollar, and the national bank proclaimed full convertibility
Jan. 2, supported by a $1 billion loan from Western countries.
   For decades, the real value of the of the zloty was one-fourth
the official rate.
   Traders have accepted the level and no black market has emerged
to sell the Polish currency more cheaply. The national bank said it
had not used any of the $1 billion fund because the market remained
in balance.
   ``Our guess was perfect,'' Balcerowicz said. ``Success in this
respect was extremely important for the whole economic program,
including prices, because a stable exchange rate means ... prices
of imported goods do not go up.''

   One woman reported canvassing shops for a
half-hour to find the right coin to make a one-minute telephone
call.
   Another had to paste stamps across most of the front _ and half
the back _ of the envelope to amass enough postage for her letter
to London.
   Then there are the new public transit ticket machines, rendered
virtually useless because the fare rose to 480 zlotys. The chances
of finding 24 of the largest coin available _ 20 zlotys _ are about
nil.
   And so it goes, as Poland adjusts its money and postage to the
real prices of doing business.
   Triple-digit inflation has accompanied a massive overhaul of the
economy, which included removing government budget subsidies long
used to keep prices artificially low.
   The largest bill in circulation is worth 200,000 zlotys, or $21,
and was issued in November. A 100,000 zloty note worth $10.50 went
into circulation last month.
   Higher denomination postage stamps are being created, with the
largest now worth 1,000 zlotys, or nine cents, about one-sixth the
cost of an express letter to London.
   But until the larger denomination stamps are produced and
circulated, extensive licking and pasting will be required.
   Tales of post office chaos are widely traded, including one
about the man sent home to re-package his goods so the box would be
big enough to accommodate all the stamps. The new box he returned
with weighed more, and it was not big enough to take the additional
stamps.
   With 20 zlotys worth 0.2 cents, coins have been rendered
virtually obsolete except for use in pay telephones.
   When the price of a call was raised last year from five zlotys
to 20, the pay telephones were adjusted to accept only one of the
three sizes of 20 zloty coins in circulation.
   ``We did not know it would be so hard to find them,'' said
Maciej Zdzieniecki, spokesman for the Polish telephone company.
``It was a surprise. We adjusted the phones to this new 20 zloty
coin and it turned out they were in short supply.''
   The lack of proper coins for pay phones is no small problem in a
country where home telephones are scarce. Reports from the World
Bank and other sources put the number of telephones at 10 to 12 per
100 people, the lowest in Europe except for Albania.
   ``It is impossible to make a call,'' sighed Iwona Terlikowska, a
psychologist waiting at the bank of pay phones in Warsaw's main
post office.
   A young man with no telephone at home said he had waited 30
minutes to get a bill changed to 20 zloty coins at the post office.
   ``You have to get here very early to get change, or they run
out,'' he said.
   A black market has developed in the 20 zloty coins, although
Zdzieniecki said reports they were selling for up to 400 zlotys
apiece were exaggerated.
   The telephone company is hurrying to introduce tokens but the
spokesman said delays at the mint have postponed production.

   Agricultural researchers would spend more time
looking for ways to help farmers cut their use of chemicals under a
bill by Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
   Contending the government has disregarded efforts to promote
sustainable agriculture _ sometimes called organic farming _
Daschle wants to broaden the Agriculture Research and Extension
Service's environmental goals as part of the 1990 farm bill.
   Daschle's proposal would require the Agriculture Department to
direct at least 30 percent of its competitive research grants
toward using crop rotation and mechanical cultivation techniques
rather than chemicals and pesticides for controlling weeds,
predators and insects.
   Co-sponsored by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., it also would establish boards for coordinating and
assessing research needs and activities.
   ``The Secretary should take a proactive role on research,
extension and education on sustainable agriculture,'' the proposal
says.
   The Bush administration's 1990 farm bill proposals recognize an
increased interest in sustainable agriculture but recommend no
initiatives beyond the rather small research program now under way.
The bill will establish the nation's agriculture policy for the
next five years.
   A report last week by Congress' Offike of Technology Assessment
said the Agriculture Department needs to focus more on sustainable
agriculture and change its traditional research and extension
service approach.
   ``Agriculture research is a form of social planning,'' said
Chuck Hassebrook, a policy analyst with the Sustainable Agriculture
Coalition, a group supporting Daschle's bill.
   ``Decisions about how public research dollars are spent and what
farming systems technologies are developed go far in shaping life
in rural communities,'' Hassebrook said.

   The battle to reform the futures markets
returns to Washington after last week's gathering of the industry's
largest trade group.
   A House committee vote is scheduled for Tuesday on a measure to
give the Securities and Exchange Commission limited jurisdiction
over stock-index futures.
   And Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., says he will soon introduce a bill
creating a bridge between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which regulates futures trading, although the agencies
would retain their separate jurisdictions.
   Such controversial issues as dual trading and user fees also got
a workout during the three-day annual meeting of the Futures
Industry Association here.
   Congressional debate on those matters should heat up after
Easter, when the Senate is expected to vote on reauthorization of
the CFTC.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., one of about 20 federal legislators
who spoke at the meeting, said Saturday that the House Energy and
Commerce Committee would vote Tuesday on his bill giving the SEC
temporary jurisdiction over stock-index futures during periods of
``extraordinary volatility,'' such as when the Dow Jones industrial
average plunges 200 points in an hour.
   The SEC has long sought jurisdiction over stock-index futures,
financial instruments regulated by the CFTC that allow investors to
trade contracts representing the cash value of stocks without ever
owning the stocks themselves.
   Some experts believe stock-index futures trading causes
volatility in the stock market, especially when they are used in
computer-driven program trades involving huge amounts of stocks and
futures contracts.
   Markey, who chairs an energy subcommittee on finance, has been
critical of the CFTC in the past. He called his proposal a step
toward a more permanent solution, which he hopes to bring about as
a moderator in negotiations between the securities and futures
industries.
   ``In the end, some central responsibility is the goal,'' he said.
   The 1987 stock market crash and the unusually high degree of
market volatility since then have resulted in a number of measures
aimed at better coordinating the movements of the stock and futures
markets.
   Dixon, who chairs a Senate subcommittee on regulatory affairs,
said this intermarket ``harmonization'' would be enhanced by his
plan to make one SEC commissioner a member of the CFTC and one CFTC
commissioner a member of the SEC.
   ``This kind of cross-membership will help further encourage the
kind of regulatory cooperation we have already seen ... and will
institutionalize their working relationship,'' he said.
   Dixon, a friend of Chicago's powerful futures exchanges,
suggested that cross-membership also would quiet critics who say
the CFTC is too close to the futures industry to be an effective
regulator.
   Markey expressed opposition to Dixon's plan, saying he ``would
prefer a more formalized resolution of the problem.''

<HEAD>Bonwit Teller Stores Sold; Name Likely to Survive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pyramid Companies will buy five Bonwit
Teller stores in an agreement that is likely to ensure the survival
of the elegant chain's name, according to a published report.
   Sale of the stores, owned by financially troubled L.J. Hooker
Corp., must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court, The New York
Times reported in Sunday's editions.
   L.J. Hooker, which filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last August, owned B.
Altman &amp; Co., another elegant New York-based retail chain. Hooker
liquidated six Altman stores in January after the stores failed to
draw acceptable bids.
   The Bonwit stores Pyramid intends to buy are located in Boston,
Buffalo, Manhasset, N.Y., and Short Hills, N.J. Two others will
operate in Cincinnati and Columbia, S.C., the Times said.
   L.J. Hooker plans to try to sell the remaining nine Bonwit
stores, the Times said.
   Pyramid is a Syracuse-based private company that operates 16
malls in New York and Massachusetts.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, but the Times noted it was
a cash transaction and did not involve any debt. Estimates within
the retail industry put the pricetag on the deal at about $17
million, the Times said.
   Bonwit was founded in 1895 as a small Manhattan millinery shop
and grew into one of America's most respected fashion retailers.
But it had not earned a profit for at least a decade, partly
because its corporate owners were reluctant to pay for improvements
and expansion.
   Retail executives said they expect Pyramid to sell more
moderately priced clothes at Bonwit than what has been sold there
in the past.
   L.J. Hooker is the U.S. arm of Australia's Hooker Corp. The
Sydney-based parent company last autumn revealed severe cash flow
problems due to high interest rates and a sagging real estate
market in Australia. The company now is being liquidated.

   The Leipzig Trade Fair opened
Sunday, providing the first major meeting ground for West German
firms rushing to link with partners in East Germany since the
collapse of Communist control.
   The spring edition of the twice-yearly fair, which focuses on
industrial machines and electrical equipment, comes at a time when
both Germanys are moving steadily toward de facto economic unity.
Few cooperation agreements are expected to be signed, however,
before the March 18 parliamentary elections in East Germany.
   Small and middle-sized Western firms are especially prominent at
the week-long fair, which East German Economic Minister Christa
Luft dubbed ``a marketplace of new chances.''
   West German companies increased their presence by about 25
percent over last year, accounting for some 1,000 of the show's
9,000 displays by manufacturers from 60 countries.
   Hans Modrow, Communist premier of the East German caretaker
government, rejected recent West German charges that his country is
not moving quickly enough toward a market economy.
   ``There is no way Modrow could act as a brake,'' the premier
said as he walked through the fair.
   Modrow appealed to West German industrialists to work together
with his country's struggling firms. ``Have faith in us,'' he said.
   On the fringes of the fair, Adam Opel AG, the West German arm of
U.S. automaking giant General Motors, signed an agreement Sunday to
co-produce passenger cars in East Germany with the Automobilwerk
Eisenach company.
   Under the joint venture agreement, both partners said they hope
to produce 150,000 Opel cars yearly at the East German company's
plant at Eisenach near the West German border.
   Organizers expect half a million visitors in the fair halls,
where all available display space was occupied for the first time
in years. Some applicants were put on a waiting list.
   Fair director Siegfried Fischer said he received a rash of late
applications after last fall's peaceful popular revolt, which
forced out hard-line Communist leaders, opened East Germany's
western border and set the economically moribund country on course
for unity with its rich, powerful neighbor.
   West German firms are looking for East German partners to tap
the country's skilled workers and gain access to what is expected
to be a major consumer market. East German companies, run for 40
years under a state-controlled planned economy, are hoping for
injections of Western technology and capital.
   Several dozen West German banks, which will provide much of the
credits needed for investments in East Germany, are also plugging
their services at the Leipzig fair. The banks have already begun to
set up offices in East Germany.
   The Bonn government is hoping that private sector moves to shore
up its neighbor's economy will stem the influx of worried and
dissatisfied East Germans that is straining West Germany's social
services.

<HEAD>Skinner Sees Major Federal Role in Transportation, Despite Shift</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government still will have a
``very major'' role in transportation programs, despite a Bush
administration proposal that would shift more spending to the state
and local level, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Sunday.
   Skinner, whose national transportation plan last week was
criticized by transport industries and some members of Congress,
defended the proposed increase in user fees and local gas taxes
that would raise costs for travelers and shippers.
   Interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' Skinner said
decreases in federal funding would apply primarily to projects that
benefit local economies and private businesses, which would be
asked to pay a greater share.
   ``In some parts of the system, where the local component is very
important and where the cost of that system is being expanded
because we have to build more facilities for that local
development, we think local development can pay a bigger share,''
Skinner said.
   ``The federal government's role is still going to be very, very
major,'' he said, adding that two-thirds of the $28 billion federal
transportation budget goes for infrastructure projects.
   Skinner said more than 33 states already have raised gas taxes
or found some independent funding source for transportation. The
9-cent federal gas tax will continue to support transportation, he
said.
   ``We don't have a mess on our hands,'' Skinner said, referring
to complaints of congestion in air and land transportation. ``We're
trying to avoid a major crisis.''
   Skinner predicted that within the next 10 years, the busy
short-haul routes between major U.S. cities would have high-speed
rail systems paid for by private developers ``who then pass the
costs on to the user.''
   He said commuters have indicated they are willing to pay for
better service at the local level.
   ``That will give us more funds to expand all over the country on
a national basis to deal with these pockets of congestion,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Test of Coke II Adds New Name to Soft Drink `Megabrand'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the beginning, there was Coca-Cola.
   But these days, store shelves are stocked with Coca-Cola, Coke
Classic, caffeine-free Coke Classic, caffeine-free Coke, diet Coke,
caffeine-free diet Coke, Cherry Coke and diet Cherry Coke.
   And last week, officials of the Atlanta-based soft drink maker
confirmed that Coca-Cola, also known as new Coke, may be renamed
Coke II. The newly named version will be test marketed later this
year.
   If Coke II catches on, there will no longer be a drink called
simply Coca-Cola.
   As incredible as that may seem, given the enormous power and
recognition of the Coca-Cola brand name, Coke spokesman Randy
Donaldson said, ``It's not a big deal to us.''
   Donaldson rejected the notion that there would be no more
Coca-Cola if Coke II takes off.
   ``We disagree,'' he said. ``There would be eight products with
Coca-Cola in the name.''
   Ever since the 1982 introduction of diet Coke, Coca-Cola has
pursued the so-called ``megabrand'' concept of marketing its soft
drinks. That approach intensified after the 1985 introduction of
the reformulated new Coke, and the consumer firestorm that resulted
in the return of the original formula (now called Coke Classic).
   Instead of selling one flagship brand, store shelves are crammed
with a large family of Coke products. Coca-Cola's main competitor,
Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsico Inc., has adopted a similar approach:
there currently are seven products with Pepsi Cola in the name.
   The numbers say the concept works, according to Jesse Meyers,
publisher of the industry newsletter Beverage Digest.
   In 1985, Meyers said, all Coke products held 38.8 percent of the
U.S. soft drink market; Pepsi's had 29.2 percent. Five years later,
the Coke line _ including those, such as Sprite, that do not have
``Coca-Cola'' in the name _ has increased to 41.1 percent and Pepsi
to 31.1 percent.
   ``Let me put that in perspective,'' Meyers said. ``Each
(percentage) point is worth $444 million at retail.''
   According to Donaldson, sales of products with the ``Coca-Cola''
name account for 33 percent of the soft drink market. In 1981,
original Coca-Cola, then the only product with Coke in its name,
had a 25 percent market share, he said.
   ``The segmentation in the market has taken place because the
consumers have said they wanted it,'' he said.
   Donaldson said it is less important for there to remain a single
product merely called Coke than to put the brand name to its best
use by spreading it out.
   ``The strategy is to utilize the strongest trademark in the
world and give the consumers what they want, which is to say
caffeine-free, diet and cherry versions of our drink,'' Donaldson
said. ``The trademark is so strong that it clearly supports a wide
variety of products.''
   Some analysts, including Meyers, say a successful Coke II tryout
would pave the way for Coke Classic to drop the ``Classic'' from
its name. Coke Classic is the best-selling soft drink, and most
people who purchase it just call it Coke anyway.
   But Donaldson, who said one of the aims of the Coke II
experiment was to diminish confusion between Coca-Cola and Coke
Classic, denied such a move was being considered.
   Despite all the hoopla last week over the news about Coke II,
the name switch is not necessarily a sure thing, said Emanuel
Goldman, a soft drink industry analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in
San Francisco.
   ``They're going to tread gently,'' Goldman said, recalling the
now legendary backfire when the original Coca-Cola was replaced by
new Coke. ``They don't want to add insult to injury by doing
something wrong with new Coke.''
   Goldman said that although new Coke is a relatively weak seller
_ with 1.4 percent of the market compared to No. 1 Coke Classic's
20 percent _ it still generates about $621 million a year in retail
sales for the company.

   A Pennsylvania publisher plans to provide food
for Soviet minds along with better-tasting sausage for Russian
bodies as part of a new joint venture in the Soviet Union.
   Rodale Press Inc. recently announced it has teamed up with two
Soviet partners to publish Russian-language magazines and books in
the Soviet Union, where the government has been taking steps to
encourage private enterprise.
   As part of the deal, the Emmaus, Pa.-based publisher of
magazines such as Prevention, Runner's World and Organic Gardening,
plans to contribute machinery to produce sausage and processed
meats that will be sold for hard currency needed for paper and
printing.
   It is one of the more unusual joint ventures as Western
publishers move rapidly in the wake of improved U.S.-Soviet
relations to produce Russian-language magazines that American
advertisers can use to reach a new market.
   McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Business Week magazine plans to publish a
Russian-language edition every other month starting in September in
the Soviet Union.
   Reader's Digest Association Inc. is considering publishing a
Russian-language edition of its flagship magazine, already
available in 39 languages.
   VGP Inc., a Boston-based company that has previously published
tourism and travel magazines, has teamed up with a Soviet partner
to publish The American-Soviet Medical Market Journal.
   The quarterly magazine, which includes summaries of articles
that have appeared in Western medical journals, was sent for free
late last month to 10,000 medical research facilities, labs,
physicians, scientists and public health officials in the Soviet
Union.
   The first issue ran 44 pages with 13 pages of advertising,
including sponsors such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and
Upjohn Co.
   Kompass Intercontinental Publishing, also based in Boston,
recently launched two Russian-language quarterlies and plans a
third for the fall.
   In a partnership with a Russian publisher, Kompass is
distributing Moscow International Business in the Soviet Union and
expects to sell 100,000 copes by subscription or at news kiosks.
   The first issue was 52 pages with 11 pages of advertising from
both American and Russian companies. The magazine is designed to
help Soviets do business with the West.
   Kompass also is producing Music International, a retitled
version of the Russian-language magazine Music in the USSR, in a
partnership with the Russian agency that brings performers into the
Spoviet Union.
   The quarterly magazine covers classical music, and 25,000 copies
are expected to be sold at Soviet newsstands.
   Procter &amp; Gamble and MCA Classics Records were among the four
advertisers in the first 48-page issue, according to John M. Rose,
Kompass chief executive.
   In late summer, Kompass plans to begin publishing a
Russian-language popular music magazine, Koncert, with a planned
circulation of 100,000 in the Soviet Union. An English-language
version will be sold here.
   But some advertising executives question whether buying space in
Russian-language magazines makes sense since the Russian ruble is
not easily converted into other currencies, many Western products
are not available in Russia and circulation figures cannot be
independently verified.
   Associate publisher Richard Mills of The American-Soviet Medical
Market Journal said advertisers aren't looking for immediate sales
but want ``to establish a beachhead.''
   The Hewlett-Packard Medical Products Group of Andover, Mass.,
bought a two-page ad that explained in straightforward terms what
the company does.
   Spokesman Joseph Laskowski said the company wanted to establish
itself as ``a credible manufacturer and someone who has been
supportive'' so that its salesmen can get right to business when
the market is opened.
   Rodale's first Russian-language magazine will be a bimonthly
called The New Farmer, which expects a circulation of 200,000 when
it debuts this fall.
   It is designed mainly for the millions of people who rent small
plots of land and use organic methods of farming, according to
Robert Rodale, chairman of the privately-held Rodale Press.
   The magazine will include original material and reprints or
condensations of stories from American farm magazines, he said. The
original copy will be from Rodale staffers and the staff of the
Russian publishing partner.
   The venture plans to publish a Russian-language version of
Prevention magazine in 1991 and has begun translating a number of
self-help and how-to books Rodale has published in the United
States.
   But Rodale, who is interested in agricultural research and wants
to replicate in Russia the Rodale research center in operation in
Maxatawny, Pa., included the state farm at Kudinova as a partner in
the venture as well.
   The farm produces about 60,000 pigs a year, but has primitive
processing equipment, he said. Rodale said his company plans to buy
about $250,000 in meat processing equipment for the farm, which can
use it to produce higher grades of processed meats and sausage.
   Proceeds from the meat sales will be used to pay for publishing
expenses, and Rodale said advertising sale profits will be used
partly to fund the Russian agricultural research center.

   General Motors Corp. is making its second major
move into Europe in a new venture with the East German manufacturer
of the antiquated Wartburg, GM said Sunday.
   Adam Opel AG, the West Germany subsidiary of GM, signed an
agreement Sunday in Leipzig, East Germany, with Automobilwerk
Eisenach that puts the automaker in the midst of a nation edging
away from communist economies.
   ``We have a good presence in Europe, now we'll have more of a
presence in Eastern Europe,'' GM spokesman Jack Harned said Sunday.
``It's a very important move for GM.''
   Harned confirmed the agreement was signed and said GM would
release more details, such as the plant's capacity, on Monday.
   Opel, based in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt, and Automobilwerk
Eisenach said they hope to produce 150,000 Opel cars yearly at the
East German company's plant in Eisenach near the West German border.
   The cars will be marketed in East Germany through the
manufacturers' existing European network, Harned said. ``This has a
lot to do with the unification of Germany,'' he added.
   Opel, which makes passenger and commercial vehicles, primarily
pursued the venture with assistance from GM.
   ``Opel is its own business with its own major investments,''
Harned said. ``And General Motors is interested in the businesses
there.''
   Harned was uncertain if the Opel models would completely replace
the Wartburg, an East German passenger car.
   ``They won't be making the Wartburg for very long as competitive
cars come into the market,'' he said.
   Opel and AWE officials signed the agreement in the presence of
East German Economics Minister Christa Luft. The ceremony coincided
with the opening of the Leipzig Trade Fair, marked by a sharply
increased presence of West German industrial firms.
   GM is already working on a $150-million investment in Hungarian
automaker RABA, Hungary's state-owned manufacturer of trucks,
diesel engines and axles. The plant is under construction in the
city of Szentgotthard.
   That deal made GM the first U.S automaker to invest in Eastern
Europe since recent political and economical liberalization.
   Volkswagen AG was the first West German automaker to engage in a
joint venture in East Germany. The company is developing a modern
model of the Trabant, an East German-built compact car with a
two-stroke, two-cylinder engine.
   The automaker said it expected the Trabant plant to start
production of the new model by the end of the year, producing up to
300,000 vehicles annually. Some customers have waited up to 15
years for delivery of their Trabant car.
   Suzuki Motor Co. was the first Japanese automaker to produce in
Eastern Europe, with plans to build 15,000 cars a year in Hungary
starting in 1992.
   Officials at Ford Motor Co. have said they were carefully
watching the Eastern European market, but no negotiations were
pending.
   Chrysler Corp. sells cars in Europe but doesn't run independent
manufacturing plants there.

<HEAD>Paper Industry Faces Environmental, High-Tech Challenges On 300th
Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the paper industry celebrates its tricentennial this week, it
returns to the lessons of William Rittenhouse _ America's first
paper maker and in essence, the first recycler _ to set its
strategy for a new era.
   Rittenhouse traveled the globe 300 years ago scrounging for used
rags to haul back to his mill on the banks of the Wissahickson
Creek outside Philadelphia. Laboriously, he beat the old rags into
pulp and fashioned the nation's first sheets of paper.
   With his small mill, Rittenhouse planted the seed that has grown
into the nation's 10th largest manufacturing industry, producing
$112 billion worth of products last year ranging from puzzles and
postage stamps to shoe boxes and home insulation.
   But as the nation's 6,400 paper plants and mills churn out 76
million tons of paper and paperboard products annually, the
industry is pressured by a nation bent on recycling.
   Just as the electronic age two decades ago threatened to dwindle
the need for paper, some have argued that recycling will
drastically limit the markets for traditional paper products.
   But America's paper makers are beginning to prowl the nation's
dumpsters for discarded paper to recycle into new products, much as
Rittenhouse searched for old rags to recycle.
   ``We see recycling as a big opportunity,'' says Red Cavaney,
president of the American Paper Institute, the trade association
for makers of pulp, paper and paperboard. The Institute kicks off a
three-day anniversary forum on Monday in New York.
   In the era of the ``green consumer,'' demand for products made
of waste paper is so great that by 1995, it will lead to the
``consumption of all waste paper that can be reasonably recovered
in usable condition,'' according to a new study by Franklin
Associates Ltd. commissioned by the paper industry.
   Last month, Cavaney announced the industry intended to be part
of the ``solid waste solution'' and was setting a goal of 40
percent paper recycling by 1995. Also by that year, the U.S. paper
industry expects to use waste paper for 30 percent of its raw
material in the production of new paper and paperboard.
   With total paper use expected to be just over 100 million tons
by 1995, that would represent a recycling goal of about 40 million
tons, according to figures supplied by the institute.
   Already, for example, the insides of cereal boxes are last
year's recycled newspapers. Cardboard boxes containing televisions
and VCRs are recycled waste paper. And before the decade is out,
the drywall in people's homes could be yesterday's disposable
diapers.
   Cavaney is counting on such innovations to meet the latest
environmental challenges and carry the industry into the next
century.
   In the 1970s, the biggest threat to the industry was thought to
be the proliferation of computers, which some believed would lead
to paperless offices.
   Instead, the demand for paper has exploded, says Hugh Hansen, a
former executive with Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.
   The demand for printing and writing paper _ used largely for
computer printouts _ increased 70 percent between 1978 and 1988,
while the growth of the economy at large increased by 28 percent,
according to the American Paper Institute.
   ``The proliferation of computers has actually spurred the need
for paper rather than reduced it,'' says Hansen, president of
Friends of Historic RittenhouseTown, the rural village outside
Philadelphia which is the site of the nation's first paper mill.
``What seems to happen is people find more uses rather than less
for paper.''
   In fact, as computers cut production time to a fraction,
business executives decided they needed four or five drafts of
documents instead of one or two, says Cavaney.
   ``People still prefer to deal with paper rather than the screen
on a computer,'' Cavaney says.
   The arrival of modern facsimile machines has spawned a growth
market in thermal paper, which is expected to continue expanding.

<HEAD>Creditors Oppose SEC Role in Bankruptcy</HEAD>

   The Securities and Exchange Commission already
has gotten $500 million out of Drexel Burnham Lambert. So who
better than the SEC to pan for more money from the drying river bed
of the Wall Street firm?
   Well, according to the U.S. Trustee's office, the Bank of China,
Bank Negara of Indonesia, Copenhagen Handelsbank and 14 other
creditors are better candidates than the SEC to sit on the
committee investigating the Drexel bankruptcy.
   The SEC, which has the largest claim against Drexel, was denied
a spot on the official committee of unsecured creditors, and the
goverment regulator has come up against opposition from other
creditors in its appeal to join the group.
   The committee's goal is to recoup as much money as possible for
more than 2,000 creditors.
   Drexel still owes the SEC $150 million of a $650 million
settlement of securities fraud charges. The unpaid amount would
compensate individual investors who can prove they were harmed by
Drexel's actions.
   But the SEC was left off the committee when it was formed last
month. It has filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to gain
admission, which would have to be granted by the U.S. Trustee
administering the case.
   The creditors haven't exactly rallied to the SEC's cause. After
two weeks of negotiations, creditors committee attorney Marc
Kirschner said in court Friday: ``I'm not really confident this one
can be resolved.''
   In other words, the committee doesn't want the SEC hanging
around.
   ``I think the creditors are distrustful of the SEC,'' said a
lawyer for a large creditor not on the committee. ``I think there
is a view ... that the SEC is the bad guy, the entity that brought
Drexel down, and they don't want to be on the same committee as
them.''
   The SEC initiated the investigation of Drexel in 1987 after the
firm was linked to suspicious behavior involving takeover deals.
   Drexel last year agreed to settle the charges by pleading guilty
to six felonies and paying a $650 million fine. Drexel's business
suffered because of the charges and was further hurt by a decline
in the junk-bond market it helped create.
   The parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
Feb. 13 after defaulting on $100 million in short-term loans and
failing to obtain new credit. Drexel subsidiaries, which are not in
the bankruptcy case, have liquidated tens of billions of dollars of
assets since.
   The request by the SEC is unprecedented, bankruptcy experts say.
The U.S. Bankruptcy Code prohibits government agencies from sitting
on creditor panels. But an amendment permits such participation if
the agency is acting on behalf of a ``person.''
   The SEC argued in legal papers that it qualifies since the money
it is owed by Drexel is earmarked for individual investors. A
hearing on the issue is set for Tuesday.
   ``I have attempted to work out a compromise with the committee
on this issue, and we have not been able to agree,'' SEC chief
counsel Richard Kirby said.
   Creditors have said they will go after the $500 million Drexel
already has paid the government. But Kirby said that shouldn't pose
a conflict because the SEC could remove itself from discussions
about the money.
   He added the SEC believes ``there's no claim'' to the $500
million. Creditors can seek back debt payments made up to 90 days
before a bankruptcy filing or up to one year for payments to
company insiders. Kirby said neither applies to the Drexel payment,
which was made last September.
   Another reason for exclusion could be that the SEC's regulatory
role would prove chilling to potential asset sales or
investigations of old transactions. With the SEC in the room, some
participants may be reluctant to talk about relations with Drexel.
   ``Our concern on the creditors committee is getting as much
money from the estate as possible, not necessarily enforcing the
securities regulations,'' said Steven Felderstein, attorney for the
California Public Employees Retirement System. Unlike the SEC, the
system was granted a non-voting role on the committee after failing
to be appointed initially.
   On the other hand, the SEC's encyclopedic knowledge of Drexel
and the securities industry could aid in scrutinizing the firm's
past and present actions.
   The SEC has an apparent ally in U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard
Buschman III, who said in court Friday it is ``very hard to
imagine'' keeping the largest creditor off the committee,
``regardless of what hat they wear.''

   Members of a paperworkers' union who lost
their jobs during a bitter 16-month strike against International
Paper Co. voted Sunday on a contract offered to hundreds of their
replacements.
   ``I think everybody expects the same outcome _ a `no' vote,''
said Ronald Roy, a member of the United Paperworkers International
Union Local 14.
   Union officials said results wouldn't be released until Monday,
after the union's national headquarters and the company had been
notified of the results.
   Roy, who was recalled to his old job at the mill last week, is
among 137 mill employees who are members of either the United
Paperworkers union or the International Brotherhood of Firemen and
Oilers, according to company officials. About 750 other members who
claim rights to be rehired also were eligible to vote.
   Most of the roughly 1,100 hourly mill employees who would be
affected by the contract were hired as replacement workers during a
sometimes violent strike in this central Maine town that ended in
October 1988. The work force includes about 70 former union members
who crossed the picket lines during the strike.
   The union represents both the present and past mill workers, and
all are allowed to vote.
   International Paper spokesman Brad Peters called Sunday's vote
``a unique set of circumstances, to some extent unprecedented.''
   ``We are hopeful ... the membership will accept'' the company's
offer, Peters said Sunday.
   Local 14 President William Meserve has said the proposed
contract ``stinks.'' He declined to elaborate when asked whether
the union's executive board was recommending rejection.
   In February, the company offered what it described as its best
offer: a package retroactive to last October, providing pay raises
totaling 6{ percent over three years, a company-sponsored
retirement savings plan and an increase in the company's
contribution to the health insurance plan.
   The contract would replace an open-ended pact that the company
imposed unilaterally during the strike.
   The union continues to represent mill workers despite an effort
begun two years ago before the National Labor Relations Board to
have the union decertified.

   A gunshot tore through a bus run by
strike-beset Greyhound Lines Inc. in Florida on Sunday, showering
passengers with glass and debris and injuring least seven people,
authorities said.
   The attack apparently involved just one shot, sheriff's
spokesman Steve Weintraub. Although none of the injuries appeared
life-threatening, two people underwent surgery for shrapnel wounds
in the throat and side, and all seven were taken to hospitals,
Weintraub said.
   Initial reports to Greyhound were that eight were hurt, said
George Gravley, a spokesman at the company's Dallas headquarters.
   The union representing Greyhound drivers went on strike 1{ weeks
ago, and there have been scattered incidents of violence. A
striking driver was crushed to death by a bus driven by a
replacement driver on a picket line in Redding, Calif., earlier in
the strike.
   There were no immediate arrests.
   Asked if the incident appeared strike-related, Weintraub said:
``I think it is. I don't know why anybody would want to shoot a
Greyhound bus.''
   Bill Nicholson, executive board member of the Jacksonville local
of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said he
doubted a striker was to blame.
   ``As far as I'm concerned it wasn't one of our strikers. ...
They've been like choirboys,'' Nicholson said.
   Said Dallas union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson: ``We believe it's
important for the public to understand that this is a strike
against the company, not against the traveling public.''
   The driver, uninjured when the shot was fired shortly before 8
p.m. EST, was able to bring the bus to a safe stop, Weintraub said.
The bus, carrying 41 passengers from Jacksonville to Daytona Beach,
was on U.S. Route 1 about 10 miles south of Jacksonville when the
shot apparently was fired from the Interstate 95 overpass.
   Greyhound said earlier that buses were again running Sunday to
120 communities that hadn't been served since drivers walked off
their jobs at the only nationwide bus line.
   The company was able to add routes to spots in the Southeast and
Southwest Sunday after a new class of drivers graduated from
training courses, said Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale.
   The spokeswoman didn't know how many of the 9,500 communities
the bus line served before the strike were being served as of
Sunday night.
   On Saturday, Greyhound carried 38 percent of the number of
passengers it did on the same Saturday a year ago and operated
one-third of the number of departing buses, Ms. Hale said. Figures
for Sunday would reflect the larger number of routes, but were
unavailable until Monday, she said.
   The 120 communities had been without service since the union,
which represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 office and
maintenance workers, went on strike March 2.
   Officials at the union's headquarters in Phoenix, and at offices
in Dallas and Washington, D.C., didn't respond to telephone calls
Sunday.
   Big cities had been served by Greyhound virtually since the
strike began. The additions Sunday included smaller cities and
small towns along routes between metropolitan areas, Ms. Hale said.
   ``Our goal is to rebuild our passenger service to a full
national network by the end of this month,'' said Greyhound
President Frank Schmieder.
   The expansion Sunday included two transcontinental routes, one
from Washington, D.C., along a southern route to Los Angeles, and
one from New York to Los Angeles along a northern route.
   On Saturday, federal mediators called the union to Washington
for a meeting Monday. The company may be called to a separate
meeting, a Greyhound negotiator said.
   No meeting had been set between the company and mediators as of
Sunday, Ms. Hale said.
   Negotiations on a new three-year contract broke down March 1 and
the two sides have met by telephone only a few times since.
