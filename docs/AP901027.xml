<HEAD>Survey Finds Big Drop in Consumer Faith in Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence in the economy plunged in
October to the lowest level since 1981-82 recession, a prominent
business research group reported Friday.
   The Conference Board's widely followed monthly index of consumer
confidence tumbled more then 24 points, the biggest one-month drop
in the 20-year history of the survey.
   ``We had a tremendous drop in confidence,'' said Fabian Linden,
executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research
Center. ``It was all pretty dreary.''
   The index is based on a poll of 5,000 households nationwide
conducted by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The poll
asks questions about spending on cars, appliances and homes, job
security, and general economic conditions. It is scrutinized by
economists because consumer spending is a crucial element in
economic growth.
   The index dropped sharply in August and did not rebound in
September, which Conference Board analysts attributed to anxiety
over the Persian Gulf crisis. But there was nothing in the economic
news to explain the September-to-October drop.
   Linden said the Conference Board had concluded that many
consumers were appalled by the inability of Congress and the Bush
administration to agree quickly on a budget package.
   ``An important factor in the decline was the great budget
comedy,'' Linden said. ``It was a pretty disenchanting
experience.''
   The Conference Board, based in New York, is a business-funded
economic research organization.

   State welfare officials will decide
next week whether to reunite a moonlighting single woman with the
5-year-old daughter she locked in a car while she worked.
   Chante Fernandez, 24, of Elizabeth, says she couldn't find a
baby sitter she trusted nor get government care services.
Prosecutors agree she didn't neglect her daughter.
   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty Friday to a disorderly persons
offense, was given a $100 suspended sentence and was spared
probation. She had faced up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
   ``I was only trying to get us out of the situation we were in,''
Ms. Fernandez told Superior Court Judge Robert Figarotta. ``I hope
somehow you can understand.''
   Ms. Fernandez was initially charged with criminal restraint and
spent two days in jail before posting $5,000 bail. She faced up to
five years in prison and a $7,500 fine, but Middlesex County
Prosecutor Alan Rockoff reduced the charge after his office was
flooded with calls from supporters of Ms. Fernandez.
   ``She has lost her child in the last several days, she has been
in the trepidation of feeling she was destitute without a job,''
Rockoff said. ``I think that's punishment enough.''
   Defense attorney Kenneth Weimer said Ms. Fernandez was
``desperate'' and did what she did ``out of love for her child.''
   ``My client made a bad judgment call. She was up against the
wall,'' Weimer said.
   After the hearing, Ms. Fernandez and Weimer said they were
surprised by the lenient sentence and would concentrate on
reuniting Ms. Fernandez with her child, Anjuli.
   Ms. Fernandez was arrested Saturday after police found her
pajama-clad daughter in the back of her car at a shopping mall
where she worked part-time on weekends.
   Ms. Fernandez said she left her daughter in the car because she
couldn't find a trustworthy baby sitter nor get local or state
child care services.
   She said she checked on her daughter during work breaks and left
the rear seat folded down so Anjuli could sleep in the trunk area.
   Anjuli is being cared for by the state Division of Youth and
Family Services. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 30 to decide
whether she should be allowed to go home.
   After her arrest, Ms. Fernandez was fired from a full-time at an
Elizabeth lumber company. After hearing of her plight, that company
offered to rehire her and her employer at the shopping mall offered
her a full-time job.

   Here are the highlights of congressional
developments Friday as the House and Senate pushed toward a likely
weekend adjournment of the second session of the 101st Congress:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BUDGET-TAXES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic and Republican leaders sought support among rank and
file members for a five-year, $250 billion deficit-reduction
agreement that would embrace taxes affecting virtually all

   The Senate vote 89-7 to approve a major overhaul of immigration
law, with higher total legal immigration allowed and setting aside
visas to reunite families and admit people with special skills. But
the House sidetracked the bill on a procedural question and its
future was uncertain.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese wrestler who once fought
Muhammad Ali, a French daredevil pilot and an American Vietnam
veteran are among the would-be peacemakers who have converged on
Baghdad since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I am here to try to stop a war,'' said Antonio Inoki, 47, of
Tokyo.
   Inoki, a professional wrestler, lasted 15 rounds and took a draw
in an exhibition freestyle fight with heavyweight boxing champion
Mohammad Ali 16 years ago.
   ``Many Americans do not want war, and this is exactly what we
are telling the Iraqi people and the government,'' said Rick Droz,
of Pasadena, Calif., who said he lost his leg as a U.S. Marine
during the Vietnam War.
   The peacemakers descend on Baghdad almost daily.
   Western diplomats have said they are being manipulated by
President Saddam Hussein's government, whose ventures into
international public relations in the past have backfired.
   Shortly after Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor on Aug. 2,
Saddam was shown on Iraqi television with detained Westerners, whom
he has called ``guests.'' Saddam's pat on the head of one Western
child brought world outcry.
   His speeches to the West, broadcast worldwide, have often been
rambling self-justifications couched in religious terms.
   His latest tactic appears to be welcoming foreign peace groups,
lodged free of charge at five-star hotels and met by huge
``Welcome'' banners.
   ``None of them talk of who started it all,'' a Western diplomat
said on condition of anonymity. ``It is like I insult you, I slap
you, I rob you and then a neighbor comes and says `peace, peace.'''
   But most of the visitors speak earnestly of their desire to help
avert war.
   They claim they are free to move around Baghdad, but almost none
speaks Arabic so they need interpreters. In Iraq, an interpreter is
often a secret service agent or a government official.
   Well-known public figures who have come to intercede on behalf
of Western hostages include American civil rights activist Jesse
Jackson, Austrian President Kurt Waldheim and former British Prime
Minister Edward Heath.
   All succeeded in winning the freedom of limited numbers of their
countrymen. Waldheim took home 95 Austrians; Heath was allowed to
take 33 Britons; Jackson got out 55 Americans, and a few days ago
an Iraqi-American group took with it 14 U.S. citizens.
   But thousands of Westerners are still detained in Iraq and
Kuwait, and about 600 are being used as human shields at strategic
installations to deter possible attack by U.S.-led multinational
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Saddam's government appears thrilled by the peace groups and
occasional celebrities who drop in.
   ``We want peace as well,'' one Iraqi official said on condition
of anonymity.
   The visits are well-publicized by Iraq's state broadcast and
print media.
   ``I am here to represent the attitudes of 75 percent of the
French people, all of whom know about war, its miseries and
disasters,'' the English-language Baghdad Observer quoted French
daredevil pilot Albert Maltret as saying.
   Maltret, whose professional name is Baron Noir - or the Black
Baron - made headlines in 1988 when he buzzed Paris aboard an
ultra-light plane.
   He took with him to Baghdad his 16-year-old daughter and
13-year-old son.
   The Iraqi News Agency ran a 400-word profile of Maltret, calling
him a ``French national hero'' who ``says he is ready to fight and
die for the values and principles of the peace-loving people of
Iraq and their leader.''
   A 20-member American group named the Fellowship of
Reconciliation, brought children's paintings with peace-loving
themes.
   ``These are all done by our kids back home, and you can make out
how much they think of peace,'' said Evelyn Mattern, who identified
herself as a Roman Catholic nun from Raleigh, N.C.
   Jim Lewis, a clergyman from Raleigh, walks around Baghdad in a
long white robe, a cross hanging from one shoulder. ``Give peace a
chance, please,'' he said in an interview.
   One Asian diplomat was less critical of the peace groups than
his Western counterparts.
   ``You never know which of the peace groups may succeed in
stopping a war,'' he said on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Some American businessmen are urging the U.S.
government to end its trade ban against Vietnam because they say
other foreign investors are gaining an upper hand.
   ``We think the trade embargo against Vietnam should be lifted,''
Thomas White, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Council of American
Chambers of Commerce, said Friday.
   ``There is a tremendous interest to do business in Vietnam,''
said Mattie Genovese, an American businessmen in Hong Kong.
American firms are interested in mining, agriculture, fishing and
tourism there, he said.
   U.S. businessmen from the Asia and Pacific region have been
meeting in Singapore for two days to discuss trade and investment.
   The businessmen said the trade embargo was causing them to lose
out to other nations now entering a potentially lucrative market.
   The embargo was imposed on North Vietnam in 1964, and extended
to the entire country after the Communists seized Saigon in 1975.
Violators face penalties of up to $1 million and 10 years'
imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   A Pan Am jet with 183 people aboard made an
emergency landing in the Hebrides, west of the Scottish mainland,
after one of the aircraft's engines began losing oil, the plane's
captain said.
   The Airbus landed safely Friday at Stornoway Airport, on the
Isle of Lewis, and no one was injured. The small airport had no
suitable gangways so passengers were taken off in a basket rigged
to a hydraulic lift, officials said.
   Arrangements were being made to fly the passengers on to London.
The flight had been headed to New York from Vienna.
   The Isle of Lewis is the northernmost island of the Hebrides.
The captain of the plane, Curtis Briggs, said he noticed the engine
was losing pressure as the plane was about 50 miles south of
Stornoway.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Oil Facilities Said Wired With Plastic Explosives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait wired all
four of the Persian Gulf emirate's oil refineries with plastic
explosives and carted off large chunks of Kuwait's oil industry
equipment, U.S. government sources say.
   The explosives, if detonated, could knock out Kuwait's entire
refining capacity, the sources said Friday.
   Explosives also have been placed at other vital oil
installations, including pipeline pumping stations, oil processing
centers, oil wells and loading terminals, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the moves appear to be part of a ``scorched earth''
strategy by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to devastate Kuwait's
economic base in the event his army is forced to withdraw by the
U.S.-led multinational forces in the region.
   ``They're basically all wired up for destruction - even the
refineries,'' said one source, who is involved in the
administration's monitoring of developments inside Kuwait.
   Iraq also is removing large quantities of chemicals, pipes,
meters and other oil-processing and production materials from
storage areas in Kuwait for apparent use in Iraq, the sources said.
There is no evidence, however, that the Iraqis are dismantling oil
refineries by removing operational parts, they added.
   Representatives of the exiled Kuwaiti government have said their
country's oil industry was being severely damaged by Iraqi forces,
but few details had come to light.
   The threat of war against Iraq to force Saddam's army out of
Kuwait has been a central reason for the rapid escalation of crude
oil and gasoline prices over the past 10 weeks. Oil market
participants fear that war would knock out many oil production
facilities in Kuwait, Iraq and possibly Saudi Arabia, creating a
global shortage.
   An administration source said U.S. spy satellites had provided
photographic evidence of Iraqi forces moving Kuwaiti oil industry
equipment and materials across the border into Iraq.
   ``It's a wholesale cannibalizing,'' said one American oil
industry source.
   By capturing Kuwait in an Aug. 2 invasion, Iraq gained control
of one of the Middle East's most advanced oil production and
refining industries. Kuwait's four modern refineries - Mina
Abdullah, Mina Ahmadi and Shuaiba near Kuwait City and the much
smaller Mina Saud facility near the southern border with Saudi
Arabia - had a pre-invasion capacity of nearly 900,000 barrels a
day.
   The explosives attached to these facilities could, if detonated,
knock out all of Kuwait's refining capability for at least six
months, the sources estimated. It would take at least two years to
get the facilities back to full capacity, they said.
   Details about the installation of plastic explosives at
refineries and other Kuwaiti oil facilities have come from Kuwaiti
exiles and from released foreign hostages, an administration source
said.

<HEAD>D.C. Mayor Says Jail Sentence Won't Affect Bid for Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry says he plans to proceed
with his campaign for a city council seat even though he faces a
six-month jail term for cocaine possession.
   ``For the next few months, I will manage the District (of
Columbia) government and also continue my campaign for city
council,'' Barry in a brief meeting with reporters after Friday's
sentencing.   Asked whether he should continue his bid for a city-wide
council
seat, Barry responded, ``Absolutely. Why not?''
   He attributed the jail term to the inequities of ``the American
injustice system.''
   Barry is locked in a close battle for second place in an
eight-way contest for a council job. The top two vote-getters will
win council posts, and recent polls show that Democratic nominee
Linda Cropp has a sizable lead.
   The final seat is expected to be won either by Barry or
incumbent Hilda Mason of the district's Statehood Party.
   Barry dropped his Democratic party affiliation and registered as
an independent to run for the seat less than two weeks after being
convicted of the misdemeanor possession charge. He had ruled out
running for a fourth term as mayor in advance of his drug trial.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could have merely
sentenced Barry to probation as a first offender, but he said the
mayor's ``breach of public trust alone warrants an enhanced
sentence.''
   The judge stayed the sentence, which also includes a $5,000
fine, pending resolution of an appeal filed by defense attorney R.
Kenneth Mundy.
   Jackson also placed Barry on one year of probation and ordered
him to submit to random drug tests during that period. And he
ordered Barry to pay for the cost of his incarceration, which would
come to $5,167 if, as is likely, he is sent to a minimum-security
facility, according to Bureau of Prison figures.
   Barry's drug use ``contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs
have inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long,'' Jackson
said.
   ``Having failed as the good example he might have been to the
citizens of Washington, D.C., and, in particular, to the young who
are much more likely to respond to example than to admonition, the
defendant must now become an example of another kind,'' the judge
said.
   After the sentencing, Barry said, ``I should have been shocked
and stunned, but I'm not. I understand that there are different
sets of standards for different people, and that's the American
injustice system.''
   Mundy, who argued during the trial that Barry had been singled
out for prosecution because he is a well-known black official, said
the judge had made the mayor ``a whipping boy for all the ills that
beset the District of Columbia.''

   Authorities have arrested a man suspected
of making the bomb that blew up a French jetliner over Niger last
year, killing 170 people, official sources said.
   The victims included the wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad and
a Chadian Cabinet minister.
   The government sources said Friday that Jean Bosco Ngalina,
believed to be a citizen of either Zaire or Congo, was being held
at Makala prison in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ngalina
confessed to making the bomb. They did not say when he was
arrested.
   The plane, on a flight in September 1989 from Brazzaville,
Congo, to Marseille, blew up over the Tenere desert shortly after
making a stop in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad.
   The Zairean government did not officially comment about the
arrest reported Friday in the Kinshasa daily newspaper Elima.
   A French news magazine, Le Point, reported last month that
investigators believed three Congolese dissidents carried out the
bombings with the support of Libyan agents.
   A subsequent report in The Times of London said that Syria also
was involved.

   Germany will resume accepting Jewish
immigrants from the Soviet Union, officials said, after a temporary
halt that Jewish groups harshly criticized.
   Faced with record numbers of newcomers, the government stopped
giving visas to Soviet Jews in mid-September. More than 10,000
applications had been filed in Kiev alone.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Willi Hausmann said in an interview
Friday that the government will talk with Jewish groups in Germany
and abroad about how to resume the immigration.
   German officials had expressed fears that rising anti-Semitism
in the Soviet Union may force many of the estimated 2 million
Soviet Jews to seek new lives in Germany.
   Germany's social services and housing have been strained to the
limit by the arrival of about 200,000 asylum-seekers from the Third
World and Eastern Europe this year, in addition to about 500,000
East Germans.
   Fewer than 40,000 Jews currently live in Germany, compared to
600,000 before the Holocaust.

   The Senate early Saturday completed
congressional action on a bill to prevent the District of Columbia
from using its own tax dollars on abortions for poor women unless
necessary to save the life of the mother.
   The Senate approved the measure by voice vote several hours
after it cleared the House, also by voice.
   ``It is a compromise that is necessary at this time,'' said Rep.
Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on the District of Columbia. ``It is one that I
certainly am not happy with.''
   The restriction was included in the district's spending bill for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. A similar provision was in last
year's bill.
   The measure includes an appropriation of $548 million for city
operations, of which $430 million is known as the federal payment,
paid the city in lieu of taxes on federal property. The bill also
approves the spending of $3.9 billion from the district's own
treasury.
   The abortion restrictions were put in the bill by a House-Senate
conference committee after the House rejected the bill twice in the
last week y because it allowed the district to spend its own money
on the procedure.
   Dixon said that when conferees went back to work on the bill
after the rejections, they reduced it by $2 million to please some
members of the House who also felt the federal government was
giving the city too much money.
   He said the money came out of appropriations for the city's
schools and administrative services.
   The original House and Senate bills prohibited the use of
federal funds for abortion, except to save the mother's life and in
cases of rape and incest, but were silent on the use of local
funds.
   President Bush had said he would veto the legislation if it
contained funds for abortion. He made the same threat last year and
was succesful in forcing retention of a ban on use of local funds
in last year's appropriations bill.
   ``It is the 11th hour,'' said Dixon. ``There is no alternative.
For the first time the House is now mandating to the residents of
the District of Columbia how they spend their own money.''
   ``What this does is get it down to the White House,'' Dixon said
of the abortion restrictions. ``It lets the District of Columbia
get their federal payment and get on with business. I hope next
year this house and the president of the United States will change
their attitude.''

   President Bush and his top advisers will
decide next week whether to expand the mission of Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to Saudi Arabia to include other Arab
countries, U.S. officials say.
   Egypt is almost certain to be added to the itinerary as Baker
seeks to bolster the Arab coalition against Iraq.
   His stop in Saudi Arabia was announced Friday by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. At the same time, Fitzwater said it was
``not true'' that Baker would ask leaders of the oil-rich monarchy
to approve military action against Iraq to force its withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One bound for
Hawaii, Fitzwater said Baker and the Saudis would discuss ``the
implementation of U.N. sanctions, the status of U.S. and
multinational forces in the gulf, general defense needs, Arab unity
and military options.''
   Fitzwater announced the trip in Los Angeles, where Bush was
making a campaign appearance. The president had talked by telephone
on Thursday with Saudi King Fahd and with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   Fitzwater said Bush also talked to German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who will visit
Washington next month; and Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   Besides trying to hold the Arab coalition together, the
administration wants to make sure the Western Europeans support the
drive to force an Iraqi pullout.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday that up to 100,000
additional U.S. troops would be sent to the Persian Gulf in
response to the continuing buildup and fortification of Iraqi
occupation forces in Kuwait.
   Baker's trip to the region, for which no date was announced,
will underscore U.S. resolve to end the 12-week-old occupation of
the emirate.
   A decision to send Baker to Egypt and possibly other Arab
countries will be made when Bush meets next week with his four
principal advisers - Baker, Cheney, national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell - said
the officials, who requested anonymity.
   Meanwhile, the State Department announced that Jordan was in
compliance with U.N. sanctions against Iraq and suggested that
wealthy countries such as Saudi Arabia help the stricken Jordanian
economy.
   Although State Department spokesman Richard Boucher did not
explicitly urge Saudi Arabia to end its oil cutoff and ease its icy
stance toward King Hussein's government, the message was obvious.
   ``The Saudis have been very forthcoming and generous,'' Boucher
said.
   Jordan fell into disfavor both in Washington and in Saudi Arabia
when it hesitated on applying sanctions against Iraq after the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Keating Glad to Testify if Granted Immunity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr. might testify before the
Senate Ethics Committee if guaranteed his words won't be used
against him elsewhere, his lawyer suggested.
   Keating, the Arizona developer who controlled Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association, is a central figure in the nation's savings
and loan debacle. Experts say Lincoln may be the costliest failed
thrift ever at $2 billion. Keating faces a multitude of civil and
criminal charges.
   The Los Angeles Times reported this week that the Ethics
Committee was considering giving him limited immunity to testify in
its probe of five senators to whose campaigns and causes Keating
gave $1.3 million. The report were subsequently denied.
   ``Mr. Keating has a wealth of information and insight,'' his
attorney, Stephen Neal, said after a court session Friday in a
Keating securities fraud case.
   ``If it were up to Mr. Keating, he would be talking to all of
you about it. At the present time that is just not appropriate,''
Neal said.
   But he added: ``If I were an appointed or an elected public
official ... I would think long and hard about ways to enable Mr.
Keating to share the information and insights he has on all of the
issues, including campaign financing.''
   Asked if he was open to offers, Neal said: ``I certainly will
receive or return a phone call.''
   Keating, in his first court appearance since he was released
from jail on bail last week, stood beside his attorney but declined
to comment.
   The Ethics Committee is investigating whether Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and four others improperly intervened with
federal regulators on Keating's behalf. Also being scrutinized are
Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
   The judge at the hearing Friday said he will unseal transcripts
of secret grand jury proceedings in the criminal case but delayed
disclosure for a week to give lawyers the chance to appeal.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito rejected arguments by lawyers for
the developer and his co-defendants, who said publicity surrounding
such a disclosure would damage the chances of finding unbiased
jurors for the trial.
   Ito accepted the position of lawyers for the Orange County
Register and the Los Angeles Times, who argued that First Amendment
case law supports free access to court records.
   The judge said he would excise from the 4,600-page transcript
the prosecution's opening statement and closing argument, which he
said were slanted against the defendants and might be prejudicial.
   Keating and three officials of his companies are accused of
fraud in the sale of ``junk bonds'' at branches of Lincoln Savings,
which he controlled through his American Continental Corp. The
maximum penalty is 10 years. He has pleaded innocent.
   Keating's extravagant personal habits and investments in
high-risk, high-yield junk bonds and risky real estate ventures
have made him a central figure in the savings and loan crisis.
   He maintains he's being made a scapegoat by regulators and
legislators hoping to avert blame for the debacle themselves.
   On a defense request, the judge delayed until Nov. 9 a hearing
on motions to throw out the 42-count indictment on which the
66-year-old Keating was jailed for 33 days until he posted a
reduced bail of $300,000 last week.

<HEAD>Perry Points Finger at Hightower for Losing Fingertip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower's chopped-off finger is now an issue in his campaign.
   His Republican rival says Hightower is inept because he recently
lost his fingertip in a lawn mower accident.
   ``This incident fully emphasizes his total lack of common
sense,'' Perry said Friday.
   Hightower's campaign responded, saying, ``It's unbelievable
Perry is trying to make this a campaign issue.''
   ``It is an indication that Perry doesn't have serious programs
and ideas to talk about,'' said Brigid Shea, Hightower's campaign
spokeswoman.
   Last week, Hightower cut off the tip of his finger while mowing.
   After a news conference Thursday, Hightower quipped, ``I managed
to put my finger under a lawn mower. If you'll check your manual
and remember what your Mama said and what common sense tells us, is
don't do that.''
   Perry blasted Hightower, saying, ``It's probably a good thing
Hightower is not a farmer, because there are machines much more
dangerous than lawn owers on the farm, like shredders and bush
hogs and balers.''

   Retiring Gov. William A. O'Neill says he
is disappointed by the negative tone of the campaign among the
three men hoping to succeed him.
   O'Neill indicated he was glad he wasn't running again, recalling
that one of the reasons he decided against seeking re-election was
that he was afraid the campaign would get nasty.
   ``It's moving in that direction,'' O'Neill said.
   This week, Republican John Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison

the cable industry. While the cable deregulation bill was before
the Senate, Weicker accepted free plane flights from a cable

<HEAD>Candidate Spends $3 Million on Senate Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is a shot at a U.S. Senate seat worth $3 million?
   James Rappaport, a Republican running against incumbent
Democratic incumbent John Kerry, has thrown more than $3 million of
his own money into the race so far.
   Kerry has raised about $5 million without spending any of his
own money.
   All of this for a job paying $98,400.
   ``Given the importance of paid media (advertisements) in
campaigns today, it is sad but true that especially in a
Democratic-dominated state it is virtually impossible to run a
campaign against an entrenched incumbent unless one has significant
personal means,'' said Rappaport campaign spokesman Richard Gaines.
   Rappaport's spending still pales in comparison to the $12
million in personal funds that Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., spent
in 1984 to win his first race for the Senate.

<HEAD>Candidates Take Out Petitions for Lukens Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four more people took out petitions to run
for the unexpired term of former Rep. Donald Lukens, raising the
possibility of a special election.
   Republican state Rep. Jim Buchy urged the governor to appoint
the winner of the Nov. 6 general election to fill the unexpired
term in western Ohio's 8th District.
   Lukens, a Republican, resigned Wednesday rather than risk being
expelled in the final days of his term because of new allegations
of sexual misconduct.
   Following Lukens' resignation, Gov. Richard Celeste signed an
order requiring a special election to fill Lukens' unexpired term,
which ends Jan. 3.
   Under the order, if only one Democrat and one Republican file
for the interim seat, the district can scrap the primary and print
just one extra ballot for a special election coinciding with the
regular election Nov. 6. But if additional candidates file, the
district must hold both a primary Nov. 6 and a special election
Nov. 21.
   Four Republicans took out petitions Friday to run for the
unexpired term. They join Republican John Boehner and Democrat Greg
Jolivette, who have taken out petitions to run for the unexpired
term and who will be the only two candidates running for the new
term.

   Marines tossed horseshoes, batted
volleyballs, ate grilled hamburgers and hot dogs, and jokingly
played softball in gas masks as they enjoyed their first day off in
more than two months.
   ``We'll be good to go for another couple of weeks after this,''
Sgt. Charles Owen, 35, of Mobile, Ala., said Friday.
   Owen said before the day off tempers had begun to flare and
morale to sink among the 500 men in Combat Service Support
Detachment 111, which handles supplies and maintenance for Marines
in the northernmost sector of Saudi Arabia.
   The sports equipment and food were provided by American
employees of Saudi ARAMCO, the kingdom's largest oil company. The
civilians came to the unit's recreation area to mingle.
   ``We're really proud to have these people here,'' said Joe
Serna, a former Marine who served in Vietnam, ``and we've come out
here to give them a little bit of moral support.''
   The civilians and their wives grilled the meat and dished up the
baked beans, baked potatoes, potato salad and watermelon.
   The ARAMCO workers also played softball with the Marines,
providing one of many teams taking to the diamond in a steady
stream all afternoon. It was a test for the specially groomed sand
surface that the Marines dubbed ``The Bob Hope Field of Dreams.''
   It was a reference to Hope's trips to entertain troops and to a
recent movie about a baseball field built in an Iowa cornfield.
   Members of one Marine unit bragged they play so well they could
beat their opponents while wearing gas masks. They did so for one
inning before giving up. Rivers of sweat coursed down their bodies
as they shed their masks.
   The masks have been distributed because of threats from Iraqi
President Saddam to use chemical weapons in war breaks out. The
U.S. forces have come to Saudi Arabia to counter Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Before sending the men out to play games Friday, their
commanding officers praised them for building the unit's facility
in only seven weeks.
   In addition to the recreation area, the camp has a mess that
cooks 10,000 meals a day, a repair center that fixes things from
rifles to tanks, a medical treatment facility, and a PX that sells
radios, snacks and sodas.

   Colleagues of William Paley, the founder of CBS
Inc. who died Friday at age 89, praised him as a creative and
brilliant pioneer.
   ``He was a giant of 20th century business, a man committed to
excellence,'' CBS News anchor Dan Rather said in a statement.
   ``Among his many accomplishments was being present at the
creation of broadcast journalism, and he remained passionately
interested in the news up to the time of his death,'' Rather said.
   ``Bill Paley was obviously one of the great giants in the
broadcasting field,'' said Daniel Schorr, who worked for CBS from
1953 to 1976 and now works for National Public Radio in Washington.
   ``He created an atmosphere at CBS where one could feel that one
doesn't have to worry about ratings or the cost of putting on the
news and documentaries,'' he said.
   Laurence Tisch, president of CBS Inc., said: ``Bill Paley was an
imposing leader who wove his boundless energy and taste into the
very fabric of the company he created. He was a man of profound
grace and intellect, as well as one of the most astute businessmen
of our time.''
   Fred Friendly, president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966, worked
for Paley for 16 years.
   ``I think that broadcast journalism as it exists today would not
be here if it had not been for Paley,'' he said.
   Friendly said Paley led coverage of three important eras at CBS:
the rise of Hitler and the start of World War II, which was covered
by up to 20 hours at a time of straight news; the McCarthy era in
the 1950s; and the tumultuous 1960s.
   Paley helped make broadcasting ``what it was in the days before
there were takeovers and people who were only interested in where
the profits were,'' Schorr said.
   Schorr said when Edward R. Murrow told Paley in the late 1950s
he was worried about whether his weekly documentary news show ``See
It Now'' would make money, Paley told Murrow, ` ``We make our money
from Jack Benny, don't worry about it.'''

   Worried by Iraq's attempts to divide the West, Italy
wants to reaffirm a common stand on the Persian Gulf crisis at this
weekend's European Community summit in the Italian capital.
   The two-day meeting that begins late today offers the 12 EC
leaders their first chance to sit together to discuss the crisis
caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Plans for European monetary, economic and political union are
also on the agenda for the meeting. Italy is playing host to the
summit as part of its six-month term as community president.
   A government spokesman, Pio Mastrobuoni, said Friday that Italy
wants the summit to produce a renewed commitment of EC solidarity
and coordination in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The EC must maintain complete cohesion if it wants to have
credibility in the rest of the world,'' he said.
   Mastrobuoni said Italy is concerned by recent signs of
``discrepancies'' in the way West European countries have dealt
with the situation of the hundreds of foreign hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   He said Iraq's decision to allow all French citizens to leave
could give President Saddam Hussein the impression he can divide
the multinational alliance lined up against him.
   ``The motto `all for one, and one for all' should remain,'' the
spokesman said. ``We must stay united. We can't give the impression
that the front has been weakened.''
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis traveled to Cairo on
Friday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who
recently visited several countries in the Persian Gulf region.
Officials said Mubarak's evaluation of the situation would be
conveyed to the EC leaders.
   The summit is also expected to review the community's plans for
integration in advance of mid-December meetings in Rome to formally
institute the program.
   Mastrobuoni said Italy will propose that the leaders set Dec.
31, 1993, as the date for creation of a European central bank and a
common currency. The idea s bound to upset British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, who is against the proposals.
   The spokesman said Italy also hopes the summit achieves some
consensus on the giving the EC a common foreign and security
policy.
   The leaders are also expected to discuss the economic troubles
of the Soviet Union, although no new aid offers appear likely.
   Negotiators in Luxembourg on Friday sought to keep the divisive
issue of farm subsidies off the Rome agenda. Jacques Delors,
president of the EC's executive body, said it could be
``disastrous'' if the agriculture and trade ministers are unable to
break the deadlock before the summit.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose government faces elections
in December, is against a proposal for 30 percent cuts in farm
subsidies over 10 years. His aides insist on special aid to offset
any income losses suffered by farmers. France and Ireland back
Germany in the dispute.

   U.S. industries are threatening formal action
to get the government to penalize Thailand for tolerating piracy of
American movies, music, books, computer software and trademarks.
   Major copyright industry groups said Friday that unless the Thai
government cracks down immediately on known pirates they will file
a trade complaint on Nov. 15 that could lead to new penalty duties
on Thai exports to the United States.
   The warning was issued in a joint letter to Thai Ambassador
Vitthya Vejjajiva from the Motion Picture Export Association of
America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the
International Intellectual Property Alliance.
   The letter said industry representatives have provided the Thai
government with ``the names and addresses of known pirates'' who
operate ``blatantly and apparently without any fear that the Thai
enforcement authorities would take any action.''
   ``Unless the actions we have requested ... are taken
immediately, the (groups) will ... file a formal trade complaint
under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974,'' it added.
   The alliance estimated in a statement that piracy of records,
tapes, videos, books and software in theSoutheast Asian country
loses American originators more than $60 million a year.
   Calling Thailand ``the worst offender of intellectual property
rights in Asia,'' Motion Picture Association Chairman Jack Valenti
said, ``Thai pirates steal from our member countries $10-$15
million annually in potential revenues ....
   ``Illegal copies of American movies are on sale throughout
Thailand within days of their release in the United States and well
before their legitimate release in Thailand,'' he said. ``American
movies are increasingly screened without license by illegal Thai
cable TV systems outside of Bangkok.''
   Recording Industry Association President Jay Berman said, ``We
have worked closely with Thai officials and have been more than
patient in awaiting promised government action to prosecute known
audio pirates doing many thousands of dollars of illicit business
daily ... the Thai government in blatant disregard of U.S. record
companies and in violation of its international obligations has
simply refused to prosecute these criminals.''
   Eric H. Smith, general counsel of the property alliance, said in
a statement that U.S. record and motion picture industry
representatives have been threatened physically in Thailand when
they seek enforcement of their rights.
   ``The Thai government has simply refused to move against the
pirates ... despite repeated U.S. government and private sector
entreaties,'' he said.
   At the time of Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's visit
to Washington last June, it was reported in Bangkok that the prime
minister might offer to step up the war against the flow of
narcotics to the West in exchange for leniency on the intellectual
property problem.
   In 1989, the U.S. government put Thailand on a ``priority watch
list' because of the issue and withheld duty concessions on $165
million worth of Thai exports to the United States. No further
action was taken, however, and Thailand enjoyed a $1.4 billion
trade surplus with America for the year.

   Federal arts regulators must consider general
standards of decency when awarding grants, under a mildly worded
admonition against obscenity that neared approval in Congress
today.
   A House and Senate conference committee agreed late Friday night
to accept the House's compromise anti-obscenity provisions for the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   It dropped provisions sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., that would have banned federal support for any works
that denigrate religious objects or beliefs.
   The agreement came on a conference report on the nearly $12
billion Interior Department and related appropriations bill for
fiscal 1991, which includes $175 million for the NEA.
   Also included was a three-year extension of the arts endowment -
a reauthorization expected to lessen pressure on Congress for new
anti-obscenity arts provisions next year.
   The aopted House language says that obscenity lacks artistic
merit, is not protected speech under the Constitution and ``shall
not be funded.''
   It contains a disputed provision that instructs the NEA chairman
to ensure that grants are awarded ``taking into consideration
general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs
and values of the American public.''
   The Interior spending bill was expected to go to the full House
and Senate today.
   Conferees were meeting again today to resolve one remaining
disagreement on an offshore oil-drilling moratorium in selected
areas, which Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., wanted removed.
Conferees sought the final agreement in hopes they could report
full agreement on all elements, a move that would avoid amendments
that could pick apart the package.
   Both the House and Senate decided earlier to scrap explicit
anti-obscenity restrictions that Congress slapped on the NEA a year
ago under pressure from Helms and other conservatives.
   Instead, both chambers would leave judgments of obscenity to the
courts and require the NEA to get its money back from grant
recipients whose federally subsidized works are ruled obscene in
state courts.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said the Senate conferees decided not to press for the religious
denigration prohibition. The House chairman, Rep. Sid Yates,
D-Ill., sought to have House conferees agree to drop the mild House
obscenity language but lost on a 6-3 vote. At that point, Byrd said
the Senate would go along with the House.
   ``I have my own viewpoint with respect to the arts,'' Byrd said.
``But I see no point at this juncture ... to continue to wrestle
with that.''
   The agreement apparently ends a long debate over the propriety
of art receiving subsidies from the NEA, a controversy touched off
by explicit homoerotic photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe
that received indirect federal support.

   Israeli leftists and Palestinians are
lambasting a government report that says police shot Arab
stone-throwers in self defense earlier this month. Far-right
leaders say the document hurts Jewish interests.
   Less-radical right-wing parties say the report released Friday
bolstered Israel's earlier declarations that the rioters were
chiefly to blame for the violence Oct. 8, in which police gunfire
killed 20 Palestinians.
   The 59-page report, written by a three-man investigative
committee appointed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, drew
immediate criticism from leftists and Arabs.
   ``The impression given by the first announcement of the report
is that the committee sees the deaths of about 20 Palestinians and
the injury of more than 100 Palestinians as a necessity that cannot
be condemned,'' said legislator Yair Tsaban of the left-wing Mapam
Party.
   ``If this is true, this report will create great dissension not
only in the world, but in Israel,'' Tsaban said.
   In the Oct. 8 riot on Temple Mount in Jerusalem's walled Old
City, more than 140 people were wounded by gunshots in addition to
those killed, according to hospitals. Police initially listed 19
dead, but Friday's report increased the toll to 20.
   Police opened fire after Moslems on Temple Mount started
throwing rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall below.
   In an Oct. 12 resolution, the U.N. Security Council condemned
the use of excessive force and ordered a U.N. team to investigate.
Israel has refused to allow the inquiry.
   The United States joined in the condemnation and supported the
inquiry, stirring Israeli anger. Washington is Israel's chief ally.
   Countering the U.N. plan, Israel has offered instead to submit
its own report. But that idea has been rejected and ``has no
chances of being accepted now,'' according to a senior government
official quoted by Israel television.
   In Israel, two parties - the liberal Shinui and the Communists -
have called on the government to cooperate with a U.N.
investigation.
   The country's less-radical right-wing parties welcomed the
report's conclusions.
   ``It was shown without doubt that there was a clear provocation
on the part of (Arab) worshipers on the Mount. ... There was no
other choice but to respond in this way,'' said Religious Affairs
Minister Avner Shaki of the National Religious Party.
   The report said police were justified in resorting to live
gunfire on stonethrowers. It said Palestinians started the riot.
   But it also said there was indiscriminate fire by police and
leveled stinging criticism at senior police commanders for ignoring
signs that rioting might break out in the tense atmosphere.
   Palestinian leaders criticized the investigating panel.
   ``It was only an editing committee that was just making a
formula for the position of the Israeli government. I believe that
we must have a neutral committee that can come from the United
Nations,'' said Faisal Husseini, a prominent Palestinian leader
from east Jerusalem.
   The report also drew fire from Israel's far right. Rabbi Moshe
Levinger, a leader of the Jewish settlement movement, said the
whole investigation was a ``most serious mistake'' that can harm
Israel.
   Gershon Salomon, the head of a Jewish group widely blamed for
provoking Moslems, said he was ``glad the committee put the
responsibility on the Arab rioters and killers.''

   About 800 Daily News editorial workers struck
Friday rather than accept management's order to cross picket lines
set up by eight other unions at the financially troubled tabloid.
   Management at the nation's second-largest city daily flew in the
replacement workers to help circumvent a violent strike that began
Thursday night when 1,800 employees walked out.
   Substitutes were imported from Tribune Co. newspapers in
Orlando, Fla., and Chicago. Officials of the Daily News, which is
owned by the company, said the paper would be on newsstands this
weekend.
   Daily News director of labor relations Edward Gold said the
paper would begin replacing workers if they failed to show up at
work ``as soon as possible.'' The newspaper has 2,600 unionized
employees.
   ``This is not a typical labor strike situation,'' said political
reporter Frank Lombardi. ``They've declared an all-out war on the
unions. They don't want negotiation, they want total
capitulation.''
   Union contracts expired in March.
   The News, using management and replacement workers, claimed it
printed and distributed 611,000 copies of Friday's newspaper. The
normal daily circulation is 1.18 million, second only to the Los
Angeles Times among metropolitan newspapers.
   But deliveries of the single edition were spotty at best after
firebombs, rocks and other projectiles were hurled at delivery
trucks leaving plants in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Long Island.
   The Daily News was unavailable at rush hour at many midtown
Manhattan newsstands, suburban railroad stations and other spots in
the metropolitan area.
   The content was limited as well. The paper had just 48 pages,
with just 7{ pages of local, domestic and international news
articles. In comparison, last Friday's paper contained 116 pages.
   Sporadic violence was reported again Friday night. Cars and
buses carrying replacement workers again were pelted with rocks as
they drove from the Brooklyn plant. Two strikers were arrested on
charges of reckless endangerment, police spokesman Mark Warren
said.
   The News has lost about $115 million and seen daily circulation
slip by about 700,000 in the past 10 years.
   The strike was good news for the Daily News' competitors in the
battle for tabloid survival in the city. New York Newsday and the
New York Post printed additional copies in an effort to pick up
News readers.
   Outside the News' highrise headquarters on 42nd Street, pickets
marched and union leaders told workers to head home for the day.
   Editorial employees from The Newspaper Guild initially honored
the picket lines, then joined the strike at what was billed as an
informational meeting Friday afternoon.
   Barry Lipton, the local Guild president, said the decision to
strike was made after the News told union officials that
replacement workers had already filled some editorial jobs.
   The News has taken a hard line in its negotiations with the
unions, saying it must eliminate labor abuse to save $50 million to
$70 million a year. The unions say the paper is trying to break
them.
   Michael Alvino, president of the 700-member drivers' union,
called the strike at about 10 p.m. after 60 drivers with the most
seniority were fired and replaced with non-union workers. Union
workers had walked out early Thursday after management ordered one
worker to stand rather than sit on the job.
   The only one of 10 unions not involved in the strike is the New
York Typographical Union, whose 200 members have lifetime
guaranteed jobs.
   Late Thursday, replacement workers driving delivery trucks were
attacked in New York and New Jersey. Eleven arrests and two minor
injuries were reported.
   ``This vandalism and outright violence by the strikers is
deplorable,'' said John Sloan, the News' vice president for labor
relations. ``These are orchestrated and purposeful criminal acts.''
   A truck leaving a Kearny, N.J., plant was firebombed at 3:10
a.m. in neighboring Harrison, N.J., although no one was injured.
Two men were arrested shortly after the incident for possession of
three Molotov cocktails, Kearny Police Lt. Michael Davitt said.
   Two trucks in Brooklyn were attacked, including one that crashed
into two parked cars after it was pelted with debris. Similar
incidents in Garden City led to six arrests for disorderly conduct
at the plant there.
   There were two arrests in Brooklyn and one more in New Jersey.
   Sloan, in a statement issued by the News, also said the families
of News executives were threatened overnight by union members.

   Actor Kevin Costner has put up nearly $1
million to help his big brother open a casino in Deadwood.
   Dan Costner, 39, plans to turn a clothing store on Main Street
into a casino, restaurant and bar called the Midnight Star. Kevin,
35, and the clothing store's owners will be minority partners, Dan
Costner said.
   Dan Costner said his brother, star of ``Field of Dreams'' and
``The Untouchables,'' provided most of the $1 million used to buy
the property.
   The older Costner said he and his brother fell in love with the
Black Hills last year during the filming of ``Dances with Wolves,''
which Kevin Costner stars in, co-produced and directed.
   Dan Costner moved from California to Lead to meet state
requirements that majority owners of gambling operations be
residents of South Dakota.
   He hopes to open the casino next year.
   Gambling was legalized in 1989 in Deadwood, the Black Hills gold
rush town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876 while
playing poker.

<HEAD>Pentagon Lists Taboo Subjects For Troops In Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The ``Jewish lobby'' and provocative
commercials for perfume and lingerie are among the subjects
American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia are being advised not to
discuss with their hosts.
   In a pamphlet written by the U.S. Central Command, the Pentagon
is advising U.S. troops that those and other topics ``should be
avoided or handled carefully. The pamphlet was printed for
distribution to some of the estimated 200,000 American service men
and women in and around Saudi Arabia.
   Topping the list of 15 ``sensitive'' items is ``articles and
stories showing U.S.-Israeli ties and friendship.'' The pamphlet
also suggests restraint in discussion of ``anti-Arab demonstrations
or sentiments in the United States'' and of ``U.S. involvement in
supporting Israel and Israel's current presence in Lebanon.''
   The Pentagon, which advises troops to carry the booklet at all
times, also suggests that the Americans avoid discussing or showing
``sensual advertisements for perfume, blue jeans, women's lingerie,
gambling, alcohol, etc.; ads for pork or shellfish (which are
forbidden by Islam).''
   Other out-of-bounds topics include:
   -``Discussing the `Jewish lobby' and U.S. intelligence given to
Israel.''
   -``Referring to the Arab blacklisting of U.S. companies that do
business with Israel or the Arab boycotting of companies that have
strong Zionist representation in executive positions.''
   Jewish groups have protested the list, first published in the
November issue of Harper's Magazine.
   The World Jewish Congress said in a letter to Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney that it wanted to convey ``our sense of
distress at what appears to be a capitulation to bigotry and a
surrender of our democratic values ....''
   The letter, from WJC Vice President Kalman Sultanik, urges
withdrawal of the material from circulation.
   The American Jewish Committee, expressing to Cheney its ``deep
sense of hurt and anger,'' said U.S. troops should not be asked to
``submerge entirely those values of tolerance, pluralism, and
open-mindedness that have made the U.S. a unique democratic
society.''
   The Pentagon and State Department, mindful of the vast cultural
and religious differences between Saudis and Americans, have issued
a number of booklets setting out ``dos and don'ts'' since the
troops began arriving in the Persian Gulf in August.
   Most of the pamphlets include a brief history of Saudi Arabia
and its monarchy, and explanations of the strict Moslem code which
governs Saudis' behavior. Alcohol is out for Moslems and for
foreign troops; so is socializing with Saudi women.
   Other guidelines for Americans found in the pamphlets are: women
should cover their legs and arms when out in public; women and men
should not show affection in public; Americans should not show the
soles of their feet to a Saudi (by sitting with their legs propped
on a table, for example) because the gesture is considered an
insult; Americans shouldn't ask Saudi men about their wives;
Americans shouldn't offer their rations to Saudis because they
might contain pork, which is forbidden by Islam.
   But the Central Command pamphlet goes beyond the social and
cultural mores to include political topics.
   In forging the international anti-Iraq coalition of Western and
Arab nations, the United States has been careful to avoid emphasis
on its strategic and historic relationship with Israel, the largest
recipient of American foreign aid.
   Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Arab world, who have fought
five wars with Israel since it gained independence in 1948, have
traditionally accused the United States of being biased toward the
Jewish state.
   The Central Command pamphlet was originally written several
years ago for American troops taking part in the biannual ``Bright
Star'' maneuvers with Egypt, said Pentagon officials.
   That version contained several additional guidelines which have
been removed from the booklets distributed for Operation ``Desert
Shield,'' said the officials. The omitted material includes
discussing ``films or newsclips featuring pro-Zionist actors and
actresses (e.g. Barbara Streisand, Liz Taylor).''
   But Pentagon spokesman Lt. Commander Ken Satterfield said that
material was not included in the new booklet.

   Sponsors are putting on a final drive for
approval of the first overhaul of legal immigration in 25 years,
designed to reunify families and bring more skilled workers to
America.
   ``We are providing a charter on how future Americans will become
future Americans,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Friday
night as the Senate approved the compromise measure, 89-8.
   Hours later, however, the bill snagged in the House, where
critics said the increase in visas for families was inadequate and
condemned a pilot program for testing identification card security.
They said it would lead to a national I.D. card similar to ones
used in a police state.
   The bill failed, 235-186, on a preliminary House vote late
Friday. Sponsors made technical changes and said they would try
again later.
   The measure would allow into the United States more people from
countries in Western Europe and elsewhere that have been
traditional sources of immigration, but less so in recent years.
   Legislation designed to curb illegal immigration was approved by
Congress in 1986. But the current bill represents the first major
reworking of the nation's legal immigration system since 1965.
   It would allow visas for 700,000 individuals annually, starting
next Oct. 1 and for three years thereafter. It would allot 465,000
visas for families of American citizens and permanent resident
aliens and 140,000 for immigrants with special job skills.
   It would earmark 40,000 admissions for people from countries
such as Ireland, Poland and Italy that traditionally had been major
sources of immigrants earlier in the nation's history. And 55,000
visas would be set aside for spouses and children of aliens
legalized under the amnesty provisions of the 1986 legislation.
   The original House version of the bill would have allowed an
estimated 800,000 immigrants a year compared, with the current
500,000. The Senate version would have resulted in an estimated
630,000.
   From 1995 onward, the bill would earmark 480,000 visas for
family members, 140,000 for those with special job skills and
55,000 for those from nations that have been traditional sources of
immigrants.
   Under the bill, the limit on immigration from Hong Kong would
climb to 10,000 a year and after 1994 to 27,000 a year. The
provision was inserted in the bill at the urging of American
companies that do business there.
   The companies have been suffering a loss of key employees as the
time approaches when control will pass from Britain to China in
1997.
   The bill aims to assure Chinese employees they will have plenty
of opportunity to come to the United States later and that there is
no need to get out now.
   An estimated 30,000 Irish living in the United States illegally
also would effectively receive amnesty.
   In the Senate roll call, the opponents were Sens. William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.;
James Exon, D-Neb.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Trent Lott, R-Miss.;
William Roth, R-Del.; and Warren Rudman, R-N.H. Not voting were
Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; and David
Pryor, D-Ark.

   Lawmakers striving to rescue an omnibus
anti-crime bill before Congress goes home performed emergency
surgery, cutting death penalty provisions and curbs on
semiautomatic assault weapons.
   ``This is a farce,'' Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., said Friday
after House and Senate negotiators also erased the last traces of
the anti-crime proposals sent to Congress by President Bush two
years ago.
   The cutting was designed to make the measure more acceptable all
around. Liberals took a dim view of the death penalty, while
conservatives were cool to restrictions on assault weapons.
   Early today, House and Senate conferees were still trying to
figure out a way to preserve one controversial provision - which
would allow the government to seize the homes of those accused of
savings and loan fraud.
   Provisions remaining in the bill were ones that had not caused
fireworks. ``It's a mini crime bill now,'' said Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
said the bill should have contained death penalty and assault
weapons provisions. As passed, the Senate bill prescribed the death
penalty for crimes ranging from presidential assassination to
murder of a federal egg inspector.
   The House version was similar. The Senate version also would
have imposed curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons. Lawmakers
said both provisions were guaranteed to cause filibustering that
would kill the bill.
   ``It still has a number of significant provisions,'' Biden said
of the compromise version.
   Details were still being settled. But lawmakers were aiming for
a bill including grants for treatment of abused children,
tightening curbs on chemicals used in drug manufacture and a
program to set up ``boot camp'' prisons.
   Other provisions would address victim rights, juvenile justice,
prisoner drug testing and a host of other issues. The bill would
authorize additional FBI and drug enforcement agents as well as
more federal prosecutors.
   Lawmakers erased language that would have allowed courts to
consider evidence gathered with flawed warrants. Also eliminated
was a ``racial justice'' provision that would have allowed death
row inmates appealing their sentences to use statistical evidence
of racial bias on the part of the court.
   Biden said that while he would have preferred additional
provisions, it was necessary to be realistic about the support
available for the bill.
   ``It signifies that when you are in a situation where you have a
determined minority in the Republican and Democratic parties that
say they're going to filibuster everything, they can do it,'' he
said.

<HEAD>New Economic Decrees Allow 100 Percent Foreign Ownership</HEAD>

   Foreign investors will be allowed to own companies
in the Soviet Union under a new set of decrees issued by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to help move the Soviet Union to a
market-based economy in two years.
   The decrees issued Friday also sharply devalue the ruble.
   They were announced as Gorbachev opened a three-day state visit
to Spain, where he hopes to obtain further economic aid and
increase trade with the West.
   The national legislature voted last month to give Gorbachev
far-reaching power to order economic changes by decree.
   Although the legislature has not yet approved a detailed
blueprint for the transition from a centrally planned economy to a
market one, it has generally agreed on the concept.
   One decree announced Friday says foreign investors can establish
enterprises in the Soviet Union, either in joint ventures with
Soviet firms or with 100 percent foreign ownership. In the past,
Soviet firms had to retain majority control.
   The decree also permits Soviet citizens to buy shares in
enterprises, purchase bonds and hold other securities, either
singly or in registered groups, the official Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   Profits of foreign investors can be reinvested or transferred
abroad under rules promulgated by the Soviet legislature, the
decree said. It did now say when the new rules would be announced
or when they would take effect.
   ``Foreign investors on Soviet territory will enjoy legal
protection, and conditions cannot be less favorable than the
corresponding conditions for the property of Soviet organizations,
enterprises and citizens of the U.S.S.R.,'' the decree said.
   The decree on stock ownership will have little immediate impact,
because the Soviet Union does not yet have a stock exchange.
However, officials have been discussing opening an exchange and
recently sought advice from visiting representatives of the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The new commercial exchange rate for the ruble will go into
effect on Thursday, cutting the value of the Soviet currency by
nearly 70 percent to spur exports and reduce imports.
   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the state Foreign Economic
Commission, had warned this month a devaluation was coming.
   It will ``make exports more profitable for Soviet producers and
facilitate the streamlining and restriction of imports, which have
been growing rapidly since Soviet enterprises were granted the
right of free access to the foreign market,'' he said.
   Devaluation of the ruble, though, affects only one of the two
official exchange rates.
   The new exchange rate for international commercial transactions
will be 1.8 rubles per U.S. dollar, compared to the current .56
rubles to the dollar. This is the rate used by Soviet and foreign
companies.
   The rate for foreign tourists exchanging money in the Soviet
Union will remain unchanged at 6 rubles to the dollar. The Soviet
government introduced the tourist rate this year largely to combat
black market activity.
   Both rates are set artificially by the Soviet government, and
neither reflects the real worth of the ruble, either to companies
trading commodities or tourists trying to buy Soviet wares such as
a Matryoshka doll.
   On the black market, a dollar can fetch 15 to 30 rubles. Many
international companies get around the artificial exchange rates by
bartering goods, such as Pepsi for Stolichnaya vodka.
   Still, the new exchange rate is somewhat more realistic than the
old one and should make some transactions easier.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev ordered government-run banks to pay
higher interest rates on ruble savings accounts beginning Nov. 1,
as a move to persuade depositors to keep their money in banks,
despite the devaluation.
   Soviet banks now pay 2 percent or 3 percent annual interest on
savings accounts, depending on the term of the deposit. Under
Gorbachev's decree, Soviets will earn 5 percent to 10 percent
interest on their money, depending on how long they promise to
leave it on deposit.

   Gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth
admitted during a televised debate that he had ``wild years,'' but
denied swimming nude with girls.
   As Grunseth debated two challengers Friday, fellow Republicans
pressured him to quit the race, fearing his troubles could drag
them down to defeat.
   ``I can't say, Jon, you have to get off the ticket. . . . I
don't have that kind of power,'' said U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.
``But I can talk to him and tell him I think he has a future and he
should not endanger that future by running in a three-man race and
coming in third.''
   Grunseth is trying to unseat incumbent Gov. Rudy Perpich, a
Democrat seeking an unprecedented fourth term. State Auditor Arne
Carlson, who lost to Grunseth in the Republican primary, began a
write-in campaign after Grunseth became entangled in the
nude-swimming allegations.
   During Friday night's debate, Grunseth said he went through a
``wild years'' period a decade ago when he was separated from his
first wife and later divorced. But he said the allegations he swam
nude with teen-age girls at a 1981 pool party are untrue.
   ``The legend of Jon Grunseth has been grossly exaggerated,'' he
said. ``There are things I've done in my life I wish I hadn't done.
That's not unlike most of us.''
   Perpich blasted Grunseth during the debate for having said the
governor was behind the allegations two young women brought against
Grunseth.
   The women said in sworn statements that Grunseth invited them
and two other teen-agers to join him for the nude swim. They said
they declined but that Grunseth and the other girls took off their
clothes.
   One of the women also said Grunseth tried to pull down her
bathing suit top and touch her breast.
   ``People who know me know that I wouldn't even think of this,''
Perpich said. ``Why would I want to hurt your family or you? Why
would I do that? ... This is an outrage.''
   Grunseth has called Perpich the ``supreme liar'' for denying any
connection, but has admitted he has no proof Perpich was involved.
   Boschwitz, seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate, said
Grunseth's troubles are hurting the campaigns of all Republicans in
Minnesota.
   ``It has an impact on dozens of people who are running for the
state Legislature who are out there knocking on doors and working
their hearts out, and I really don't want to see those people hurt,
nor myself,'' he said.
   But Grunseth isn't quitting, his campaign director, Elam Baer,
said Friday.
   Grunseth called a news conference Thursday to announce he was
dropping out of the race, but decided at the last minute to stay
in.
   ``Last night, we slammed the door shut, nailed a couple of
spikes in it and locked the deadbolts and he is in this race until
Nov. 6,'' Baer said.

   Three former Northwest Airlines pilots, the
first to be convicted of flying a commercial jetliner while
intoxicated, said they're relieved they didn't get longer prison
sentences.
   ``It's less than what I expected,'' Capt. Norman Lyle Prouse,
51, of Conyers, Ga., said after being sentenced Friday to 16 months
in prison.
   First Officer Robert Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and
flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn., each were
sentenced to 12 months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum also ordered three years of
probation for each man after release from prison, but levied no
fines. While on probation, the pilots can't fly planes with
passengers.
   Kirchner and Balzer were freed pending appeals of their
convictions. Prouse didn't ask to be freed pending an appeal, but
the judge gave him five days to file a request.
   ``Gentlemen, you are good men who have done a bad thing,'' the
judge told the three.
   ``Who can comprehend an entire crew alcohol impaired?''
Rosenbaum said. ``It is a crime against our sense of security. In
that sense, all of us are a victim of this crime.''
   Bruce Hanley, attorney for Balzer, said the judge may have been
influenced by a tide of letters urging leniency. The letters, which
the judge talked about in court, came from friends and families of
the pilots. There were no letters from passengers of the flight or
others who might have been outraged, the judge said.
   ``People were not writing, `Crucify these people,''' Hanley said
after sentencing.
   Rosenbaum said the risks of ``piloting innocent civilians to
their untimely deaths must be weighed against pain of (the pilots')
families.''
   Peter Wold, attorney for Prouse, said he feared Rosenbaum would
sentence his client to six years or more in prison. William Mauzy,
attorney for Kirchner, said he was ``relieved'' the sentence was at
the low end of the federal guidelines recommending 12 months to 18
months in prison.
   The maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   ``I'm very willing to do what the judge has said,'' Balzer told
reporters. ``It's been a pressure cooker for a long time. I go from
here.''
   ``I'm grateful,'' Kirchner said.
   Each of the defense attorneys argued for prison terms of less
than 12 months. They said a pre-sentence investigation report
erroneously found that each of the defendants had not taken
responsibility for his actions.
   The prosecutor, Elizabeth de la Vega, said, ``I think overall it
was an appropriate sentence. . . . I think it sends a message to
pilots.''
   It was the first federal prosecution under a 1986 law making it
a felony to operate a commercial airplane under the influence of
drugs or alcohol.
   The three on March 8 flew a Boeing 727 from Fargo, N.D., after a
night of heavy drinking at a bar. The plane, carrying 91 people,
flew smoothly and landed safely at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport, where the pilots were arrested.
   ``What difference does it make that you landed the flight
safely?'' Rosenbaum said. ``The danger was there.''
   Prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rum-and-cola drinks at
the bar. Balzer and Kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer.
   Northwest fired the pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration
stripped their licenses.

<TEXT>
   The widow of one of six U.S. servicemen
immortalized as they raised the American flag on Iwo Jima during
World War II faces eviction from the home the war hero helped build
40 years ago.
   Pauline Gagnon had planned to turn the home, which includes her
travel agency, into a museum for her husband's pictures, war medals
and a flag that flew over Iwo Jima.
   But she ran into financial trouble and the house was sold at a
foreclosure auction during the summer. She's been living there
while she fights in court to overturn the sale.
   Her troubles are the latest for the family of war hero Rene
Gagnon, who died of a heart attack at age 54 in 1979. Gagnon, who
once said being a war hero was a blessing and a curse, was troubled
by alcohol abuse throughout his life. His drinking got him fired
from one job on Memorial Day 1978.
   In an interview Friday, Mrs. Gagnon said her husband was proud
of the home and would be heartbroken to see it taken from her. The
photograph of her husband and his companions struggling to raise
the flag still is on display in the one-story, three-bedroom house.
   Mrs. Gagnon said her husband, a Marine, never overestimated his
wartime contribution, despite the celebrity it brought him.
   ``He said he just did his job,'' she said. ``They just said, `Go
do it,' and he did.''
   According to accounts from Iwo Jima, three Marines were trying
to hoist the makeshift flagpole on Feb. 23, 1945, but it was too
heavy. Two more joined in, and then someone called Gagnon. As the
six raised the pole, Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal
took what became the most famous photograph of the war.
   It became the model for the Iwo Jima Memorial near Arlington
National Cemetery in Virginia. The memorial commemorates the 5,931
Marines who died taking the Pacific island.
   Gagnon was buried at Arlington, but only after his widow argued
for two years with officials who said he didn't qualify for
interment at the crowded cemetery.
   Mrs. Gagnon, who declined to give her age, blamed her current
plight on the slow economy and an overzealous buyer.
   She mortgaged her home when her business slowed, saying she
planned to pay off the mortgage by selling some of the land. She
couldn't win approval of her plans to subdivide it.
   She maintains in court that Resource Financial Group, which sold
the mortgage, and two women who bought it took advantage of her
plight. She has asked the court to reverse the sale and release her
from the mortgage.
   On Wednesday a judge gave her 10 days to post a $100,000 bond or
face eviction. The bond is in case she loses her court fight.
   Rene Gagnon was 19 when he fought on Iwo Jima. After the war he
took a brief fling at a movie career, playing himself in the John
Wayne film ``Sands of Iwo Jima.''
   That was the extent of his acting career. Mrs. Gagnon told him
to choose between acting or marriage, and marriage won.
   He was fired from his job as a night manager of a Manchester
hotel in 1978 because of his drinking. The firing came on Memorial
Day and created a furor.
   He once said all the people who wanted to buy a war hero a drink
helped fuel his alcohol problems.
   ``That's the basis of society,'' he said in 1978. ``It thinks
the biggest thing it can offer you is a drink.''

   Tourism officials worry about a
possible economic disaster this season as visitors cancel Florida
trips because of an outbreak of sometimes-fatal St. Louis
encephalitis.
   The industry already was vulnerable before the mosquito-borne
disease hit, said John Rutherford, spokesman for the Orlando
Visitors and Convention Bureau, which serves the Walt Disney World
area.
   ``They're dealing with a triple whammy - there's a slow economy,
high gas prices and now mosquitoes,'' Rutherford said.
   He said hotel occupancy and airport arrival rates in the Orlando
area have shown flat growth or a slight downturn in the past few
months.
   As of Friday, there were 63 confirmed encephalitis cases, 66
suspected cases and 28 presumed cases. Three people have died.
   St. Louis encephalitis is a virus carried by birds and spread to
humans by the bite of a particular mosquito, primarily at night,
health officials say.
   Historically, St. Louis encephalitis is most common in August,
September and October and drops off in colder weather. But tourism
officials say they can't wait.
   ``We may have a disaster in the making for the Florida tourism
industry,'' Ronald Rose, executive director of the Jensen Beach
Chamber of Commerce, wrote to the state Commerce Department.
   Rose accused the state health department of ``causing a
statewide panic.'' Representatives from the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services are stressing that the outbreak isn't a
medical epidemic.
   ``An epidemic puts it in the public's mind as something that's
out of control and requiring Draconian procedures,'' said Dr.
Robert Calder, head HRS epidemiologist.
   ``The situation isn't out of control by any means. People are
actually changing their vacation plans due to St. Louis
encephalitis, which is not called for at all.''
   The last encephalitis outbreak struck Florida in 1977, infecting
110 people and killing eight.
   The Commerce Department started playing a public service ``hot
line'' message Oct. 17, telling prospective tourists that incidence
of encephalitis is ``considered very low'' and affecting only
``five people in a million.''
   The Division of Tourism distributed more than 7,000 pamphlets
about St. Louis encephalitis and tips on how to avoid mosquito
bites.
   But tourists should not be lulled into a false sense of
security, health experts say.
   Dr. Charles Mahan, head HRS health officer, said that although
St. Louis encephalitis is easily avoidable, ``You can't pooh-pooh
it. It's a serious disease, and people have died from it.''

   The Security Council prepared to adopt a
resolution today holding Iraqi officials liable for war damages and
economic losses caused by its invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said.
   There will be ``a large vote in favor,'' said the council
president, British Ambassador Sir David Hannay.
   The new resolution, set for a vote at midday today, was the 10th
since the invasion on Aug. 2.
   In previous resolutions, the 15-member council has isolated Iraq
with an economic embargo and permitted U.N. member countries to use
flotillas of warships in the Persian Gulf to enforce it. The
council also has demanded that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and
release all hostages.
   The draft resolution, supported by at least 13 nations, invites
nations, companies and individuals to document their damage and
losses for the council, but does not establish a system for making
claims against Baghdad.
   The proposal also demands that Iraq stop taking hostages and
``mistreating and oppressing Kuwaiti and third-state nationals.''
   It also moves toward establishing Iraq's responsibility for war
crimes, inviting nations to collect information on serious abuses
of civilians contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and
to share it with the council.
   The convention, which Iraq signed, protects the rights of
civilians in wartime or in military-occupied territory, outlawing
summary execution, torture, deportations and hostage-taking.
   Although the new resolution holds Iraq liable for war damages,
it does not provide for punitive reparations.
   Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad A. Abulhasan estimated that Iraq has
less than $800 million in assets in the United States, which will
pay $22 billion more in energy costs in a year due to the rise in
oil prices following the invasion.
   The draft resolution also says Iraq must allow the immediate
provision of food, water and basic services to diplomats and
foreigners in diplomatic missions in Kuwait City.
   Iraq says Kuwait is now a province of Iraq and that the
diplomats must move their operations to Baghdad. It has cut off
water and electricity to the embassies. The U.S., British and
French compounds are the last Western holdouts.
   The proposed resolution asks Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to use his influence to see that the demands are met, and
he is encouraged to be available to assist ``in reaching a peaceful
solution to the crisis.''
   The draft threatens Iraq with unspecified new punishment under
Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter if it doesn't obey all its
resolutions.
   Chapter 7 allows punitive action up to, and including,
collective use of military force.
   Western diplomats conceded they have few new major actions they
can take to pressure Iraq, aside from severing telephone, fax and
cables services and retaliating against Baghdad's embassies.
   In coming resolutions the council could establish the mechanisms
for making economic claims against Iraq, and could take concrete
steps toward establishing a war crimes tribunal.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said the latest resolution
was a preparation so that someone can eventually say `` `Well, we
have exhausted all possible resolutions of the Security Council's
authority, it is now time now to use force.' ''

   The United Nations put the final touches today on a resolution
demanding Iraq pay reparations for its invasion of Kuwait. Baghdad
indicated a willingness to negotiate and prepared to free more than
300 French hostages.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III is to visit Saudi Arabia
next month to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, the White House said
Friday. The United States has sent more than 200,000 troops to
Saudi Arabia and the region to deter any further aggression and
plans on sending up to 100,000 more.
   Also Friday, Kuwait's exiled prime minister said the time had
come for a military strike to force Iraq from his homeland.
   The U.N. Security Council was expected to overwhelmingly adopt a
resolution today holding Iraqi officials liable for war damages and
economic losses caused by its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, said
diplomats, including the council president, British Ambassador Sir
David Hannay.
   Nations, companies and individuals suffering losses would be
able to apply to the Security Council for damages. The proposal
also invites nations to submit information on abuses of Kuwaitis
and other civilians contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention.
   It threatens Iraq with unspecified new punishment under the U.N.
Charter if it doesn't stop mistreating and oppressing Kuwaitis and
release foreign hostages.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said the draft resolution
was ``a preparation so that someone can eventually say `Well, we
have exhausted all possible resolutions of the Security Council's
authority, it is now time now to use force.' ''
   The United Nations already has condemned Iraq for its invasion
and ordered an international embargo on Iraqi trade to force Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   Saddam prevented thousands of foreigners from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait after the invasion. Hundreds have since been released as
Saddam apparently tries to pry concessions from Western governments
in exchange for their citizens' freedom.
   Iraq has said French nationals would be free to leave beginning
today. France insisted no deal was struck to win their freedom.
   Two Irishmen flew home from Iraq on Friday saying Saddam Hussein
granted them permission to leave as thanks for good work on his new
palace.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad said Iraqi troops had seized two
American men who had evaded capture in Kuwait for weeks. They were
identified as Uwe Jahnke, 47, of Washington Depot, Conn., and John
Stevenson, 44, of Panama City, Fla.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
were brought to Baghdad on Monday and taken to a hotel where scores
of other foreigners are being held.
   Iraq on Friday gave new indications it might be willing to
negotiate a settlement. Saddam told Channel 3 radio of Algiers,
Algeria, ``When the greater interest demands it, everything is open
to consideration.'' But he went on to rule out ``ceding our
rights.''
   There were also reports from Washington that Saddam has adopted
a ``scorched-earth'' strategy if his troops are forced out of
Kuwait.
   Administration sources said Friday that Iraq had used American
and other hostages to wire Kuwait's four oil refineries with
plastic explosives capable of knocking out the emirate's entire
refining capacity.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   French officials denied any knowledge of a letter Saddam
reportedly sent to French and Soviet leaders offering to discuss
Mideast problems.
   French President Francois Mitterrand and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to hold two days of talks in Paris
beginning Sunday. The French television network La Cinq said Saddam
told the two leaders he was open ``to all ideas'' in resolving the
gulf crisis.
   Gorbachev, opening a three-day visit to Spain, said Friday: ``We
favor taking advantage of all possibilities for a politicial
solution. Nevertheless, no one should take the search for these
joint or bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness, or for
vacillation over implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions.''
   President Bush has asked Baker to visit Saudi Arabia early next
month for discussions on the Persian Gulf standoff, the White House
said Friday. Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said news reports
that Baker would ask the Saudi government to approve military
action against Iraq were ``not true.''
   Most nations, including the United States, have said the
international economic boycott should be given time to work before
a military attack is contemplated.
   Kuwaiti officials also have agreed with those declarations.
   But now Kuwait's exiled prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, has appealed for a military strike to reclaim his own
homeland, even if it meant leaving the emirate in ruins, a Saudi
newspaper reported Friday.
   ``As a citizen and a responsible official, I am ready to
sacrifice everything for the sake of regaining my land,'' the Saudi
daily Asharq al-Awsat quoted him as saying.
   In other developments:
   -The Pentagon is advising U.S. troops to avoid discussions about
U.S.-Israeli ties with their Saudi hosts. Also on a list of taboo
subjects are sensual commercials for perfume and lingerie.
   -The European Community meets this weekend and Italy said it
will seek to reaffirm the EC's united stand on the gulf crisis.

   The plea bargain turned out to be no
bargain.
   Rather than take chances on a jury verdict, Russell Barnes
accepted a prosecutor's offer and pleaded guilty to one count of
aggravated robbery in a mugging. In return, five other charges were
dropped.
   The decision cost him at least 3{ years in prison: Moments
earlier, the jury had found him innocent of all charges.
   James Campbell, a Ramsey County District Judge, said he decided
to let the jury read its verdicts Thursday night for the benefit of
attorneys who argued the case and to make a court record in case of
appeal. The judge asked Barnes whether he wanted to hear the
verdicts. He did.
   By then, the judge had accepted the guilty plea and it was too
late to withdraw it.
   ``It was like O. Henry meets Alfred Hitchcock,'' said Richard
Coleman, Barnes' public defender.
   Coleman said Barnes ``went into shock, and so did his lawyer.''
His client's mother burst into tears. A juror, misinterpreting the
tears and the defendant's reaction as relief, came up to
congratulate Barnes, 19, of St. Paul.
   Coleman said his client acted against his advice. ``My position
had been to stick with the jury verdict, but I can understand his
fear.''
   If convicted of all six charges, Coleman said, Barnes would have
faced up to 20 years in prison, about a third of the time off for
good behavior. Under the plea bargain, he is to be sentenced to
five years and four months, and is expected to have to serve at
least two-thirds of it.
   Barnes was charged in an August incident in which he and others
allegedly beat a St. Paul woman, her two sons and a friend and
robbed them of $600.
   Jurors, who began deliberating Tuesday, twice said they were
deadlocked, and Campbell decided to declare a mistrial at 9:30 p.m.
Thursday if there was no verdict. But at 9:30 the jurors said they
were making progress and wanted to continue deliberating.
   About 10:45 p.m., Coleman said, he called Campbell's chambers to
say his client had decided to accept the plea agreement prosecutors
offered earlier. Three assault charges and one each of burglary and
simple robbery were dropped in exchange for the plea to aggravated
robbery.
   Coleman then found out jurors had just told the bailiff they had
a verdict. But Barnes stuck by his decision and entered his plea
about 11 p.m. He entered a special plea under which he did not
admit committing the crimes but conceded that he could be convicted
based on the evidence.

<TEXT>
   At least 60 children have died of
diarrhea in an outbreak of the disease that started late last month
in East Timor, a news report said today.
   The English language daily Jakarta Post said the children died
because they were either hospitalized too late or received no
medication.
   ``Most of those dead were children under five years of age who
were undernourished. Patients who were referred to clinics have
survived,'' the newspaper quoted Carlos Pareira, a local health
official, as saying.
   Pareira said the epidemic, which struck four districts, has
affected more than 600 others, mostly children.
   East Timor, about 1,200 miles southeast of Jakarta, was a former
Portuguese colony that Indonesia annexed in 1976.
   The Health Ministry said diarrhea and cholera have claimed more
than 210 lives and affected about 191,000 people in Indonesia in
the first eight months of the year.

   William S. Paley, who founded CBS, the media
giant that brought such diverse programs as Edward R. Murrow
documentaries and ``I Love Lucy'' into millions of homes, has died
at age 89.
   Paley, who had been ill with pneumonia, died Friday night at his
Manhattan home, said CBS spokewoman Ann Morfogen.
   A cigarmaker's son, Paley bought a fledgling radio network for
$400,000 in 1928 and turned it into the $3 billion-a-year
communications conglomerate known as CBS Inc.
   The broadcast pioneer controlled the Columbia Broadcasting
System for more than half a century as president or board chairman
of its radio and television networks and its film, publishing,
recording and other subsidiaries.
   ``He was a giant of 20th century business, a man committed to
excellence,'' CBS anchorman Dan Rather said in a statement. ``Among
his many accomplishments was being present at the creation of
broadcast journalism, and he remained passionately interested in
the news up to the time of his death.''
   Years after normal retirement age, Paley continued to run his
media empire from his sumptuous office atop ``Black Rock,'' the
black marble-faced tower in midtown Manhattan that houses CBS
headquarters.
   ``It's like having a child,'' he once said. ``It's pretty hard
to jerk yourself away from that entirely.''
   Paley's CBS brought viewers such distinguished journalists as
Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid, as well as such hugely
popular shows as ``I Love Lucy'' and ``All in the Family.''
   ``He gave the public exactly what it wanted,'' said former
programming chief Mike Dann. ``He wasn't the least bit interested
in creating new forms. He believed in building the best
mousetrap.''
   Born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1901, grandson of a Russian lumber
magnate, Paley studied at Western Military Academy in Alton, Ill.,
and the University of Chicago. He received a Bachelor of Science
degree at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1922.
   He then joined his father's firm, the Congress Cigar Co. of
Philadelphia, as vice president and secretary. He became interested
in radio when he discovered the pull of radio ads for the firm's La
Palinas cigar.
   With money borrowed from his father, Paley in 1928 bought the
year-old United Independent Broadcasting Corp., changed its named
to Columbia and began building his broadcasting empire.
   In 1990, according to Forbes magazine, he was worth $460
million.
   In April 1983, he turned the reins of CBS Inc. over to Thomas H.
Wyman, only the second chairman in the company's history. But Paley
stayed on as a consultant, director and chairman of the board of
directors' executive committee.
   When CBS's biggest stockholder, Loew's Corp., became unhappy
with Wyman's policies, Paley teamed with Loew's Chairman Laurence
Tisch in 1986 to retake control. Paley again became chairman, with
Tisch as president and chief executive officer.
   Paley also became a partner in 1982 in Whitcom Investment Co.,
which has wide-ranging communications holdings, including joint
ownership of the International Herald Tribune. He became
co-chairman of the Paris-based newspaper in 1983.
   Despite his reputed 80-hour work weeks at CBS, Paley became a
patron of New York City's cultural life. He was a trustee of the
Museum of Modern Art for 53 years and was one of the nation's
leading collectors of post-Impressionist masterpieces.
   In 1976 he founded the Museum of Broadcasting in Manhattan,
where the history of his network and others is enshrined.
   Paley also left a memorial to his father and a boon to Manhattan
office workers in Samuel Paley Park on East 53rd Street, just off
Fifth Avenue, the city's first ``vest-pocket'' park.
   Before awarding the hot-dog concession for the tiny park, Paley
tasted dozens of varieties of hot dogs and ended up having them
made to order, fatter than usual. He also ordered the cooking
method - steam first, then grill.
   Paley became a fixture in New York's high society with the help
of his second wife, ``Babe,'' the former Barbara Cushing, daughter
of a famed Boston neurosurgeon, Dr. Harvey Cushing.
   During 31 years of marriage before Mrs. Paley's death from
cancer in 1978, the couple entertained lavishly in their apartment
in the St. Regis Hotel and on an 85-acre estate in Manhasset on
Long Island's North Shore.
   During World War II, Paley served with the Office of War
Information abroad and, with the rank of colonel, as deputy chief
of psychological warfare for Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's Supreme
Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces. For his war service he
received the Legion of Merit and Medal for Merit of his own country
and the Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with Palm of France.
   Some of his other honors included personal citations in two
Peabody Awards to CBS; the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences'
Governors Award for ``steadfast commitment to quality'' in
broadcasting; and the Robert Eunson Award of the Associated Press
Broadcasters Association.
   Paley had two children, Jeffrey Paley and Hilary Paley Califano,
by his first marriage to Dorothy Hart Hearst, from whom he was
divorced; two by his second marriage, Kate Cushing Paley and
William Cushing Paley; two stepchildren, Stanley G. Mortimer 3d and
Amanda Burden; and eight grandchildren.
   Funeral plans were incomplete.

   Scientists have grown hair in a test tube, a
development they say could lead to a cure for baldness within a
decade.
   ``This is the real thing,'' Dr. Terence Kealey, head of a
research team at Cambridge University's Department of Clinical
Biochemistry.
   ``We have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow
in vitro,'' the balding scientist said Friday.
   Kealey stressed in a BBC radio interview that growing hair in a
test tube ``is not in itself a cure for baldness.'' But, he added,
it provides the perfect medium for experiments and could lead to
effective treatment within 10 years.
   The results of the research, in which the hair was grown in a
synthetic blood product, are to be published in the Journal of Cell
Science next month.
   Experts welcomed the achievement, saying it could lead to
preventing hair loss in men genetically disposed to baldness.
   ``Any knowledge of how hair grows and metabolizes could have
various offshoots in preventing baldness from happening,'' said Dr.
Ken Maxted, a dermatologist with the Glasgow Health Board who went
bald at 18.
   ``Whether it is a cure for people who are bald, I'm not quite
sure. I think it's rather nice having a waterproof head,'' he said
in an interview.
   Dr. John Firmage, a consultant at the Scalp and Hair Hospital in
London, said the research was an important first step to
understanding what affects hair growth and loss.
   ``Until now, it has been very difficult to know what happens''
except that the process of balding is hereditary, Dr. Firmage said.
``Hence the many lotions and potions which are produced.''
   Dr. John Romano at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in
New York said scientists would be able to test new chemicals on
test-tube hair without worrying about injuring someone's scalp.
   ``Researchers can use many more different chemicals because they
don't have to worry about toxicity,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Kealey said the next step is to find out why many middle-aged
men suffer a disruption in the normal mechanism that triggers the
growth of new, replacement hair.
   ``I hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for
baldness,'' he said.
   The successful growth of test tube hair came after a team
member, Dr. Michael Philpott, devised a method for extracting hair
follicles from the skin without damaging the roots, Kealey said.
   This is done by carefully slicing away the top two layers of
skin to remove hair follicles with fine tweezers. The follicles
then are grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained at body
temperature, he said.
   Watching hair growing in a test tube is ``an amazing sight,''
Kealey said. ``It grows absolutely identical to normal hairs - at
the same rate of 0.012 inches a day and in the same shape.''
   The research was funded by the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant
Unilever and Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council, he
said.
   Kealey said the research also could lead to a more effective
depilatory for removing unwanted hair.
   Hairs grow for about two years and then spontaneously shed, he
said, adding that a natural depilatory would result if the shedding
process could be hastened.
   ``In fact, what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade
hairs to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we
might quite quickly start trying to work on improved
depilatories,'' Kealey said.
   Cambridge University is known for its contributions to
scientific research, including discovery of the electron, the
neutron and the structure of DNA, the building blocks of genetic
material.
   Kealey said that although he was ``thrilled'' at the team's
breakthrough, as an intellectual achievement ``it has to be viewed
as rather trivial.''
   Nevertheless, many men will find the breakthrough welcome news
since, Kealey said, the onset of balding can be ``intensely
traumatic - maybe because it is the first visible sign of advancing
age.''
   ``I am myself bald, but I don't think it's something that
bothers me very much,'' he added.

<HEAD>Ferries May Provide Only Link To Hatteras For Months</HEAD>

   Hatteras Island residents may have to use
ferries for up to six months after the only bridge to the island
was hit by a dredge, toppling a 369-foot section into Oregon Inlet.
   Tourism officials worried that island businesses could lose
millions of dollars.
   ``We estimate that, if the bridge is out three months or more,
it will cost us between $18 and $20 million,'' said Gene O'Bleness,
executive director of the Dare County Tourist Bureau. ``October and
November are prime surf-fishing months on Hatteras.''
   The bridge could be out for five to six months, said Clayton
Jenson, superintendent of McLean Contracting of McLean, Va., which
built the 26-year-old Herbert C. Bonner Bridge.
   A gale tore the dredge Northerly Island from its moorings,
slamming it into the Bonner Bridge early Friday. A section f the
span collapsed an hour later. No one was injured.
   The bridge carries telephone and power lines to Hatteras, and
the accident left some of those lines dangling over the inlet.
Power was out on Hatteras and on much of nearby Ocracoke Island,
south of Hatteras in the barrier island chain that forms North
Carolina's coastal Outer Banks.
   Electric and telephone companies were waiting for weather
conditions to ease before trying to restore service at Hatteras,
but most of Ocracoke's power was restored by mid-afternoon Friday.
   Water supplies also were limited on the islands, state officials
said.
   Gov. Jim Martin declared a state of emergency after flying to
the coast to survey the situation.
   ``From what I've seen, things are pretty well organized. What
can be done is being done and plans are being made for the future.
I'm pleased and impressed,'' Martin said after a briefing by county
officials.
   Transportation Secretary Thomas Harrelson said the state was
looking at landing points for ferries and its options on setting up
a temporary crossing of the bridge. He estimated the work could
cost $3 million.
   Ferries carrying up to 40 vehicles could be in service in about
three weeks after ferry docks and access roads are constructed, he
said.
   Authorities said three landing craft would be available by
Monday to ferry supplies, such as food and fuel, and people across
the inlet.
   The island's estimated 5,000 residents and an unknown number of
tourists have had no way off the island. Ferry connections to
Ocracoke couldn't be used because winds were gusting to 60 mph,
creating waves of 5 to 7 feet in Pamlico Sound. There is no bridge
to Ocracoke, where about 500 people live.
   Among those waiting for a ride off Ocracoke was David Carper of
Ramseur, and he wasn't looking forward to the trip.
   ``I've never ridden a ferry. I have motion sickness so it
wouldn't be real fun,'' Carper said as he and his wife, Barbara,
waited at the ferry lounge. ``But rather than live here until the
bridge is repaired, we thought we'd take the ferry when we could.''

   An apparent gas leak caused an explosion
aboard a tourist ship off the Galapagos Islands, injuring 11 people
and leaving six others missing, authorities said.
   The Ecuadoran Navy and U.S. Embassy in Quito said there were
reports that the missing in the blast early Friday included five
Americans and an Ecuadoran crew member.
   There were conflicting reports that two Australians and three
Americans were among the missing.
   The 71-foot ship Bartolome II was on an eight-day cruise of the
islands 600 miles west of Guayaquil, Ecuador, when the explosion
occurred at 4:15 a.m.
   The vessel, based in Quito, caught fire and quickly sank eight
miles off the isle of Seymor, authorities said.
   Eleven people on board were rescued and were taken to the
mainland for hospitalization and treatment. Most were believed
taken to Quito, authorities said, but details remained sketchy late
Friday.
   Four of the 11 were seriously hurt, they said.
   The remote islands, visited by the explorer Charles Darwin, are
a popular tourist site replete with rare birds, fish and flora.

   Burleigh County jailers were puzzled when
Patrick Kellar showed up for a court appearance at 4:30 a.m. But
Kellar knew exactly what he was doing.
   According to an account in The Bismarck Tribune, the Bismarck
man arrived at the courthouse, which also houses the county jail,
five minutes early on Thursday and showed jailers a notice ordering
him to appear in court on a contested speeding ticket at 4:30 a.m.
   The jailers told Kellar there would be no hearing at that hour.
They wrote a note to the county clerk saying that Kellar had been
there and sent him home.
   Some court employees wondered why Kellar hadn't called the
office beforehand to correct what obviously was a typographical
error on his summons.
   They discovered his motive when Kellar called the office later
in the day. He read to the clerk the section of state law that says
that if a defendant shows up in court at the appointed time and the
prosecutor doesn't, the case has to be dismissed.
   Judge Gail Hagerty dismissed the ticket.

   Terrorists could be planning to attack a
passenger ship or aircraft ``at any time,'' the State Department
says.
   The agency said Friday night that the attack could come on a
passenger ship in the eastern Mediterranean Sea or an aircraft in
Europe or the Middle East.
   ``The risk of acts of international terrorism in Europe and the
Middle East is increasing,'' said a statement from the department's
deputy spokesman, Richard Boucher.
   He said the department had received ``specific and credible''
information about a threat to ships in the eastern Mediterranean,
and added, ``Such an operation may be undertaken at any time.''
   He added, ``We note that civil aviation remains a particular
target.''
   The department's warning came after the unusual hour of 8 p.m.,
in part because,``It's important that we share the threat
information with the American people as they plan their travel,''
said another spokesman, Adam Shub.
   Terrorists have attacked ships before. In October 1985, a group
led by Abu Abbas hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro as
it left an Egyptian port, holding it for two days before
surrendering to Egyptian authorities.
   One of the hijackers shot to death an American passenger, Leon
Klinghoffer, who was confined to a wheelchair.
   A particular reason for concern Friday was threats by the Abu
Nidal Organization, which ``has repeatedly threatened to attack
U.S. interests'' if Mahmoud Atta, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and
member of the organization, is extradited to Israel, the department
said.
   Atta, who als  uses the name Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, is wanted in
Israel on charges of participating in the April 1986 machine gun
attack on a bus carrying Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank.
The driver was killed and a passenger wounded.
   Arrested in the United States three years ago, Atta fought
extradition in the courts but lost his last appeal in the U.S.
Supreme Court on Aug. 31. The department has two months from that
date to decide to turn him over to Israel, and Friday night Shub
repeated earlier statements that it would do so.
   ``The United States takes these threats very seriously in view
of the ANO's notorious history,'' Boucher said.
   Shub said the Nidal group was believed responsible for more than
90 terrorist attacks since 1974. Using the cover name ``Black
September,'' it arranged the September 1970 hijacking of four
airliners to an abandoned airfield in Jordan, he said.
   Among its attacks were bombings of the airports in Vienna and
Rome in December 1985, the hijacking of a Pan Am airliner to
Karachi in 1986 and the attack on the day excursion vessel City of
Poros in Greece in July 1986, the department said.

   Thieves may have thought they were getting
cute house pets when they broke into a zoo and made off with two
squirrel monkeys.
   Wrong.
   Squirrel monkeys weigh a few pounds each and look adorable. But
they have a habit humans may find hard to stomach:
   ``They rub their urine onto their hands and feet and tails so
that while they run around they're marking territory every time
they touch something,'' said Ken Rudman, general curator of the
Sedgwick County Zoo.
   ``They really do smell awful at times. Actually, that's most of
the time,'' Rudman said. They're also aggressive, he said.
   Many zoo visitors think the South American monkeys would make
great pets, Rudman said. ``I'd guess that whoever stole these was
planning on having a neat pet to impress the friends with.''
   Whoever took Spock and Mowgli by cutting through a security
fence and crossing a moat in the zoo on Monday night has since
reconsidered.
   On Thursday, someone checking into a motel about two miles from
the zoo found an odd-smelling box in his room. Inside were Spock
and Mowgli.
   ``Zoo Monkeys,'' read the label on the box. ``Return to the
zoo.''

   A judge turned down a motorist's
argument that his dog should count in a car pool because the animal
watched for cars and warned his master, whose eyesight is fading.
   Sherman Hill of San Francisco argued that Queenie was being
trained as a ``seeing-eye driver'' and was learning to bark at the
sight of cars.
   But San Jose Municipal Judge John Pasco said Queenie doesn't
count as a rider. Vehicles with two riders may use car pool lanes
in Santa Clara County.
   Pasco fined Hill $115 for driving solo in the commuter lane.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh called a
public rally today to try to contain a rebellion in his party and
put a lid on growing pressure on him to resign.
   Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi quit Singh's Cabinet on
Friday and released a letter accusing the prime minister of failing
to keep his pledge of ``honesty and efficiency in government.''
   Mrs. Gandhi was the first Cabinet minister to break openly with
Singh since Tuesday when a Hindu-Moslem dispute over rights to a
holy site ballooned into the worst political crisis of the
10-month-old government.
   Other dissidents of the governing Janata Dal party pressed for a
change of leadership, arguing that dumping Singh could avert the
government's collapse and the need for an immediate national
election.
   Singh was scheduled to speak today at a rally outside his home
in New Delhi, the capital.
   At least 93 people have been killed this week in rioting between
Moslems and Hindus and in police efforts to quell the disturbances.
The two latest deaths were reported today from a clash between
police and a mob late Friday in Ranchi in the eastern state of
Bihar.
   Police clamped an overnight curfew on Ayodhya, site of the
disputed holy place, and on the neighboring town of Faizabad on
Friday. Thousands of police reinforcements have been sent to the
Hindu holy town 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site
which they say is birthplace of Lord Rama, an important Hindu god.
A Moslem mosque has stood there for 460 years.
   Police said they have detained 51,000 people in Uttar Pradesh
state and seized more than 35,000 tribal spears, tridents and other
weapons from Hindus on their way to Ayodhya.
   The Uttar Pradesh government has banned entry into the state by
leaders of the Hindu political movements behind the temple project.
   The right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew its support for
the government when Singh opposed the temple and arrested the
party's leader, who was on a cross-country march to rouse support
for the construction.
   The party's move deprived the National Front coalition of its
majority in Parliament.
   Singh faces a no-confidence motion in a special session of the
legislature Nov. 7. Barring a last-minute compromise or a
realignment of political forces, he seems certain to lose.
   In addition to Mrs. Gandhi, four other Parliament members once
considered close to Singh joined the call for him to step down even
before the vote.

   The East had clear, cold weather early today, with temperatures
dropping into the upper 20s in some regions. Skies were also clear
in the South and Midwest.
   Winds of up to 50 mph caused a dust storm in northwest North
Dakota on Friday night, cutting visibility to near zero in the
Williston area. Eleven people were hospitalized with injuries
sustained from traffic accidents, a nursing supervisor from Mercy
Hospital said. No one was seriously hurt.
   Only the chance of showers in the northwest tip of Washington
threatened a forecast of sunshine for the entire nation today.
Winds were expected to die down in the East after gusting to 40 mph
and higher Friday and temperatures should reach the 50s and 60s.
   High pressure in Nebraska was expected to bring warm air into
the Rockies, raising temperatures to the 60s and 70s, and the
Plains were looking for continued mild weather with highs in the
60s.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 60s in the Northwest,
the 70s and 80s in the South and the 90s in the Southwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 101 degrees at

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of demonstrators blocked
streets and train tracks today, halting most traffic in the capital
to press their demands for President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to
resign.
   Stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks,
when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a
general strike.
   Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at
about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a
city of 7 million people.
   Many people walked to work. Even bicycle-powered rickshaws,
Dhaka's chief mode of transport, stayed off the streets.
   Protesters paraded through the streets shouting ``Down with
Ershad!'' and ``Days of Autocracy Are Over!''
   United News of Bangladesh said 4,000 police and paramilitary
troops were deployed in Dhaka. There were no reports of violence by
midday.
   The blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition
parties to force Ershad to quit. At least eight people have been
killed by police since the current round of protests started Oct.
10.
   ``We are happy to see that the blockade has turned into a hartal
(general strike). This shows popular support for our cause,'' said
Suranjit Sengupta, a top leader of the Democratic Party. It is one
of eight parties in an alliance headed by the Awami League led by
Sheik Hasina, one of the country's main opposition politicians.
   Ershad has dismissed the campaign against him as ``the work of a
handful of violence-mongers who are out to destabilize
Bangladesh.''
   He was an army general when he seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1982. He later resigned from the military and was elected
president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign
diplomats and journalists said was rigged.
   He plans to seek another five-year term in elections scheduled
for next year. The opposition parties say they will boycott the
vote unless Ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker
government.

   Floods and landslides caused by heavy
monsoon rains have killed at least 44 people in the hills of
southern India, Press Trust of India said today.
   Most of the deaths occurred Thursday and Friday in the Nilgiris,
or the Blue Hills, 1,085 miles south of New Delhi.
   The news agency said 26 bodies had been recovered, and 18 other
people were officially listed as dead.
   Large areas of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu state were without tap
water today because of damaged pipes and a breached water tunnel,
the news agency reported.
   Weather forecasts said the heavy rains were expected to continue
for at least two more days. Up to 3{ inches of rain fell Friday in
parts of Tamil Nadu, the news agency said.

<HEAD>More Than 160,000 Gallons of Kerosene Spill in Hudson River, Coast
Guard Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARLBORO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A barge ran aground in the Hudson River
and spilled more than 160,000 gallons of kerosene, the Coast Guard
said.
   The barge Hygrade 42 grounded and sprang a leak at 10:30 p.m.
Friday about one mile south of here, said Bill Falk, a U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman in New York.
   Workers apparently halted the leak this morning, but not before
more than 160,000 gallons of kerosene had spilled, he said. The
Coast Guard Pollution Response Team was at the scene, he said.
   The barge's New York City-based owner, Hygrade Operators, had
hired a private company to help the cleanup, he said. Work boats,
vacuum trucks and about 3,000 feet of containment boom were brought
to the scene.
   The barge was heading north to Rensselaer, N.Y., when it ran
aground, Falk said. While the cause of the grounding had not been
determined, he said, high winds and choppy waters may have been a
factor.
   The barge was carrying a total of 30,000 barrels of kerosene, or
1.26 million gallons, Falk said.
   Environmental damage caused by the spill was not immediately
determined, Falk said, adding that kerosene evaportates easily,
minimizing chances of major damage. The spill posed no threat to
nearby residents.
   The site of the spill is about 50 miles north of the Statue of
Liberty.
   Kerosene, an oil usually used to fuel lamps and furnaces and as
a solvent, has a pungent odor.
   The Coast Guard said any spill of more than 100,000 gallons is
considered major.

<TEXT>
   Wake up, America. Ken Kesey has
assembled a bunch of the old Merry Pranksters for a cross-country
trip to deliver his psychedelic bus to the Smithsonian Institution.
   But here's Kesey's latest prank: When he gets there he might not
really give them the bus.
   ``They did ask for (the bus) a long time ago,'' said Kesey,
sitting at his kitchen table in his red long underwear after taking
the bus for a spin past his neighbors' farms. ``This was going to
be a swan song. But suddenly, the swan is up and dancing, and doing
rap.
   ``There's a dilemma with that Smithsonian thing. It's like the
song by The Who. `You want it? You want it? You caaaaaaan't have
it.'''
   Now 55, Kesey was a young literary lion roaring with success
from his novels ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Sometimes
a Great Notion'' when he bought the bus to take a bunch of friends
to the 1964 World's Fair in New York.
   Along the way the Pranksters became heroes of the free-love,
acid-rock, turn-on, tune-in, drop-out 1960s, largely through Tom
Wolfe's book, ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
   Ed McClanahan - a writer pal of Kesey's who missed the first
trip, but is coming along to chronicle the current one - figures
the bus inspired The Who's ``Magic Bus'' song - the one with the
lyrics ``I want it, I want it, I want it ... - You caaaaaaan't have
it'' - and the Beatles' ``Magical Mystery Tour'' movie.
   ``That trip was a seminal moment in American culture,''
McClanahan said.
   The painted psychedelic swirls that made the bus a cultural icon
originally were applied to keep it from looking like a school bus,
said Kesey's wife, Faye.
   Over the next 25 years, the designs mutated and evolved into a
mural that embodies Kesey's vision of the bus as a rallying symbol
for saving the Earth.
   On the right side is Michelangelo's Adam from the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel. Dorothy, Tin Man, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion skip
up to the Emerald City, where a northern spotted owl is perched. On
the left is a totem pole. Fish swim on the flanks. The hood
ornament is a bronze jester.
   Over the windshield is its name, Further, worn like a crown to
proclaim the bus' destination.
   The idea for this trip grew out of Kesey's latest book, ``The
Further Inquiry.'' The book originally was conceived as a play
staged on the bus, where the soul of Neal Cassady is put on trial.
   Cassady was the basis for the hero of Beat writer Jack Kerouac's
``On The Road,'' as well as the charismatic man behind the wheel of
Further. On that first trip he laid down a free-association
rap-babble that still makes Kesey shake his head in wonder and joy
when he watches old home movies.
   Kesey wanted the book to include a movie of Cassady, printed one
frame to a page, so that they moved as the pages were flipped.
   ``It's important to see how he jabbers and jumps,'' Kesey said.
   His publisher, Viking, agreed to include the flip pictures if
Kesey would drive Further to a book fair in Las Vegas.
   He had so much fun that he planned a cross-country trip to ease
Further into its grave at the Smithsonian and promote his new book.
   The latest trip won't be as wild as the others.
   ``We're grandparents now,'' Kesey said.
   He is scheduled to take Further to a book signing in Portland on
Sunday. On Monday, he heads south to California, hoping to reach
Berkeley by Halloween to help counterculture pal Wavy Gravy collect
for UNICEF and campaign for City Council. After that, the schedule
gets dim, though Kesey hopes to pick up LSD guru Timothy Leary and
gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson along the way.
   But getting back on the road has given Kesey second thoughts
about turning over the bus to the Smithsonian.
   ``This is why I would hate to see it laminated and stopped,''
Kesey said. ``It was just going good again.''

<HEAD>Diplomats Leave London to Reopen Embassy in Tehran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five diplomats who will reopen the British Embassy
in Tehran left London today saying they were giving priority to
seeking the release of an imprisoned British citizen and Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   Five Iranian diplomats were expected in London over the weekend
to reopen their embassy, the Foreign Office said.
   David Reddaway, who will be charge d'affaires when the embassy
opens, said he would seek an early visit with Roger Cooper, a
54-year-old businessman arrested five years ago on espionage
charges.
   Reddaway expects to present his credential early next week, but
there has been no word from the Foreign Office on when an
ambassador will be posted to Tehran.
   ``Getting the hostages out of Beirut is a very high priority, as
is securing the release of Roger Cooper,'' Reddaway said. ``I shall
be asking to see Mr. Cooper as soon as I can after my arrival in
Tehran.''
   Iranian authorities have said Cooper has been tried and
convicted, but the sentence has never been made public.
   Reddaway credited Iran with making ``its best humanitarian
efforts'' to seek release of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
Most are believed held by factions of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that gets considerable financial
support from Iran.
   The hostages include four Britons and six Americans.
Longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Iran and Britain agreed to restore diplomatic relations last
month.
   Ties were broken 18 months ago over British author Salman
Rushdie, accused of blaspheming Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.'' The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
issued a death call on Rushdie in February 1989. The Indian-born
novelist has been in hiding ever since.

<TEXT>
   Government troops arrested nine
people in connection with a violent nationwide strike, and
authorities today said the suspects were Communist rebels.
   Also today, soldiers killed two suspected terrorists in a car
chase and in Manila, and a suspected terrorist was killed when a
bomb he was holding went off, the military said.
   In the southern Philippines, rebels burned a bus, officials
said. The walkout by leftist unions, which began Wednesday and was
suspended Friday, has been marked by attacks on public transport.
   Marxist leaders, speaking to reporters, claimed responsibility
for the burning of five of nine vehicles in the Manila area last
week, but accused the military of carrying out the other attacks to
discredit the strike.
   The rebels also denied killing Oscar Lazaro, a leader of a major
transport organization, two days before the strike. The military
has also blamed leftists for the murder.
   In another development, about 5,000 workers marched to Mrs.
Aquino's presidential palace in central Manila for the second day,
but no incidents were reported. The rally ended peacefully.
   Col. Agerico Kagaoan, chief of the Constabulary Security Group,
said the suspected rebels were arrested in the Manila area in the
past week. He said troops seized several sticks of dynamite,
handguns and C-4 plastic explosives from the group.
   Kagaoan said those captured were members of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, and said they were believed
responsible for orchestrating strike-related violence.
   The suspects, who were presented briefly to reporters, denied
involvement in any attacks.
   Police Col. Romeo Pena said in suburban Pasig, a man tried to
throw an explosive device at a pumping station but it blew up in
his hand, killing him instantly. He said the ictim carried no
identification.
   Four hours later, another police patrol spotted a car with fake
license plates and ordered it to stop, said Capt. Mario Cruz, an
officer of the Constabulary Highway Patrol Group. He said the car's
occupants immediately opened fire, hitting the police car.
   After a chase and an exchange of more gunfire, two of the
suspected terrorists were killed, he said. Two others escaped in a
backup car.
   The government has granted a 70-cent increase in the daily
minimum wage, significantly below the $1.50 increase demanded by
the unions. Striking workers announced they would settle for a $1
increase and said they were suspending the walkout to wait for the
government to reply to their new offer.

   Thomas Root pleaded no contest to 364
counts of fraud and conspiracy but said he was chrged only because
of his notoriety as the wounded pilot whose plane mysteriously
crashed into the ocean last year. Under a plea bargain, Root agreed
Friday to a 15-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine in exchange
for the no-contest plea. He also agreed to testify against others
indicted in an alleged securities scam involving Sonrise Management
Services and Telemedia Inc. Ninety-one other charges against him
were dropped.
   His prison sentence, which won't be imposed until January, will
run concurrently with any federal sentence he receives. He pleaded
guilty to five federal securities charges in June and is awaiting
sentencing.
   ``I accept the offer with great misgivings that people will
believe that I am admitting to breaking the law in North
Carolina,'' Root said. ``I did not break the law in North
Carolina.''
   He said he thinks his name was included in the indictment ``not
because of my culpability but rather because (of) my notoriety,''
he said.
   The 37-year-old Washington attorney said he passed out in the
cockpit of his single-engine plane during a flight from Washington
to Rocky Mount in July 1989. The plane continued on to the coast of
Florida before it crashed.
   Rescuers who pulled Root from the ocean discovered he had been
shot in the abdomen. He said a pistol he kept in the plane
discharged during the crash, but authorities questioned that
explanation.
   A Nash County grand jury in June returned 24 indictments
containing 2,695 counts against Root and other officials of Sonrise
Management Services and Telemedia Inc.
   Sonrise helped form partnerships to apply for federal licenses
for low-power FM radio stations with religious programming.
Authorities said only a handful of Sonrise's 1,600 investors
received licenses, although the organization allegedly took in more
than $16 million from people in 25 states.

   Prime Minister Mike Moore
conceded defeat today as the conservative National Party appeared
headed for a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, ending
six years of Labor rule.
   National Party leader Jim Bolger, who seeks better relations
with the United States, was expected to assume a three-year term as
the country's new prime minister.
   Moore, whose center-left party suffered from a faltering
economy, phoned Bolger less than 2{ hours after the polls closed.
   ``I wish you well,'' he told a beaming Bolger, the 54-year-old
son of Irish immigrant farmers. ``You worked hard for it.''
   Final, unofficial results indicated National was likely to win
68 seats in the 97-member Parliament to 28 for Labor and one for
New Labor. A handful of seats were close enough that they still
could be decided by absentee ballots. Sveral Cabinet ministers
were among the Labor casualties.
   National polled 49 percent of the vote to 35 percent for Labor.
The Green Party, a relatively new political group that as part of
its policy has no official leader, was third with 7 percent, with 5
percent for New Labor.
   Of the 2,158,966 registered voters, 1,636,184 - 76 percent -
cast ballots.
   Labor had a 56-40 majority in the outgoing Parliament. The New
Labor Party held the remaining seat.
   Both the Nationals and Labor pledge to continue barring
nuclear-powered ships and ships with nuclear weapons from making
port calls, a policy that has angered U.S. officials.
   But the National Party seeks some sort of reconciliation with
Washington, and Bolger was welcomed in the U.S. capital at a time
when other top New Zealand officials were not.
   Moore took over as prime minister two months ago when Geoffrey
Palmer resigned with polls indicating Labor trailing by 21 points
and heading for a landslide loss.
   Moore, 41, made a desperate last-minute bid Friday for support
from environmentalists.
   In a country where pride in the environment runs high, Moore
said any vote for the small Green Party actually would be a vote
for the Nationals, whom he tried to paint as anti-conservationist.
   Greens' backers come primarily from Labor's traditional base.
   Moore had held out hope for an upset because the final polls
indicated nearly a quarter of the electorate undecided just days
before the election.
   Before Palmer resigned, Moore's backers were predicting Labor
would retain only 15 of its seats in Parliament.
   Moore, the former external affairs and trade minister, worked
hard to eat away at the government's budget deficit. He
consistently ranked well above Bolger when voters were asked who
they favored for prime minister.
   But Labor was dragged down by a sagging economy and its
unpopular privatization efforts, which National branded as
``selling off the state silver to pay the bills.''
   Unemployment is running at 7.9 percent, the highest level since
World War II, and topped voter concerns in this South Pacific
island nation of 3.5 million people.
   The country's policy against nuclear vessels and weapons,
initiated in 1984 under Labor Prime Minister David Lange, kept U.S.
warships from making port calls because the Pentagon refuses to
divulge whether any are carrying nuclear weapons.
   In response to the policy, the United States in 1986 cut
high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped the country from
the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia.

<TEXT>
   Breandan O hEithir, a keen social critic
and author of the first Irish-language novel to lead the country's
best-seller list, had died. He was 60.
   O hEithir, who divided his time between Dublin and Paris, was
admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital last week and was diagnosed as
having cancer. He died Friday.
   His novel ``Lig Sinn i gCathu,'' published in 1976, was the only
Irish-language book ever to top the nation's hardback best-seller
list.
   Translated in English as ``Lead Us Into Temptation,'' the book
was set in a university town in 1948, the year Ireland declared
itself a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth. The book was
also translated into German, and the accumulation of royalties in
East German marks encouraged O hEithir to travel in that country.
   O hEithir was born Jan. 18, 1930 at Inishmore in the Aran
Islands. His maternal uncle was the distinguished Irish writer Liam
O'Flaherty.
   In 1957, O hEithir joined the Irish Press as Irish language
editor and remained with the newspaper until 1963. He then lived
for a time in Germany and married a French citizen, Catherine von
Hildebrand.
   Returning to Ireland, O hEithir worked as a freelance
scriptwriter for RTE, the national television service. He also
wrote film scripts for Gael Linn, the Irish cultural organization,
and was a regular columnist with The Irish Times.
   Other books included ``Over the Bar,'' ``The Begrudger's Guide
to Irish Politics,'' ``This is Ireland,'' and ``Willie the Plain
Pint agus An Papa.''
   In ``The Begrudger's Guide,'' published in 1986, O hEithir
identified begrudgers as the nation's largest faction. They were
distinguished, he wrote, by ``a deep and abiding doubt about our
ability to run our own affairs as well as others might run them for
us.''
   He continued: ``Even the most idiotic of Irish politicians would
have to admit that the country has not actually flourished since
independence was granted to us, 65 years ago. It would have to be
admitted that the begrudgers in our midst have increased mightily
and filled the land with their plaintive cries and lamentations.''
   He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. The
funeral service will be held Tuesday.

   Air force planes and helicopter
gunships destroyed a major Tamil rebel base and killed 20
guerrillas in northeastern Sri Lanka, military officials said
today.
   They said 10 buildings and a network of underground concrete
bunkers, communication trenches and tunnels were destroyed in the
attack Friday at Veragal village in the Trincomalee district.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report because of
poor communications with the Veragal area, 130 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   In the northern Jaffna Peninsula 185 miles northeast of Colombo,
one soldier was killed when the Tamil Tiger rebels fired rockets
and mortars at troops in a Hindu temple Friday, the officials said,
speaking on their usual condition of anonymity.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since 1983 when rebels
from the Tamil minority started a violent separatist campaign
against the Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
and control the government and the military. Tamils, who comprise
18 percent of the population, say the Sinhalese discriminate
against them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.

   Belgium will withdraw its troops from
Rwanda on Nov. 1, the prime minister said. He spoke one day after
central African nations agreed to supervise a cease-fire in the
war-torn nation.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said the 500 paratroopers sent
to Rwanda on Oct. 4 to protect Belgians living there would help
evacuate civilians who wanted to leave the country, before pulling
out.
   Ugandan-based rebels from Rwanda's minority Tutsi tribe invaded
last month and advanced to within 40 miles northeast of Kigali, the
capital. The rebels want to overthrow President Juvenal
Habyarimana's government.
   They accuse Habyarimana, a Hutu, of corruption and say they seek
a democratic government in which all ethnic groups can participate.
   The presidents of Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Burundu agreed
Friday on measures to enforce the cease-fire established between
Rwandan troops and rebels earlier in the week. The truce has
already been broken several times.
   In a communique issued Friday after a meeting in Gbadolite,
Zaire, the leaders of the four African nations agreed on the
immediate formation of a three-nation military observer team to
monitor the cease-fire.
   The communique also directs Yoweri Museveni of Uganda - chairman
of the Organization of African Unity - to establish a peacekeeping
force to be sent to Rwanda. The size and make-up of the force was
not mentioned.
   Belgium, the former colonial ruler of Rwanda, will help set up
the African peace force to monitor the cease-fire and will supply
it with money and equipment, Martens said.
   The prime minister said, however, safety of Belgian civilians in
Rwanda remained a priority and measures would be taken to evacuate
them quickly if necessary. About 1,600 Belgians work in Rwanda, and
most are missionaries, nuns, doctors and teachers.
   Two Belgian military transport planes will be stationed in a
country neighboring Rwanda to evacuate Belgians if the need arises,
Martens told a news conference. He did not specify which nation.

<TEXT>
   Angola's ruling Marxist party has outlined
plans to accept a multiprty political system by March and hold
pluralist elections within three years in the southern African
nation.
   The announcement Friday evening by the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, could speed negotiations to end 15
years of single-party rule and civil war with U.S.-backed UNITA
rebels.
   The party's central committee said after an extraordinary
meeting Friday that Angola's constitution should be fully revised
within one year after preliminary changes planned for the next
several months.
   In a speech Thursday, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos also
hinted his party may soon drop its adherence to Marxism.
   The party said multiparty elections by direct universal suffrage
could be held three years after a truce is reached. It said that
would allow time to develop a climate of peace and conduct a census
of the population.
   The party also recommended clearing minefields throughout the
country and creating a single national army not tied to any
political party.
   Peace talks between government and rebels are expected to resume
within days in Portugal. The two sides met last month under
Portuguese mediation for the fourth time this year.
   Portuguese officials said the opponents had reached broad
agreement on adoption of multiparty democracy.
   In Washington last week, Congress approved a mechanism to
quickly suspend military aid to UNITA if the Angolan government
accepted a reasonable timetable for free elections, a cease-fire, a
halt to shipments of Soviet weapons and other conditions.
   Angola's civil war has killed more than 350,000 people, caused
widespread migrations and worsened the effects of a drought that
has left about two million hungry this year, according to the
government.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has been fighting since independence from Portugal in 1975 to force
the Soviet-backed MPLA to share control.

<HEAD>Territories May Reopen Sunday, Shomron Expects Increase In Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians in the occupied territories may be
allowed to re-enter Israel as soon as Sunday but will face tougher
security measures, Israeli army chief of staff said today.
   More than 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip have been confined to the territories since Wednesday
following a wave of Arab-Jewish street violence.
   The chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said the situation in
the occupied areas and within Israel now appeared quiet.
   ``If it continues to be quiet we will open the territory ...
soon, maybe even on Sunday,'' he told Israel radio.
   Israeli government officials say the final decision is expected
Saturday night.
   The closure cut off about 110,000 to 150,000 Palestinians, among
them laborers who have no work permits, from jobs in Israel. When
they return, they will be met with stricter security steps, Shomron
said.
   ``We will ask the employers, in a much more serious manner, not
to employ unlicensed workers, in order to safeguard themselves and
others. They, too, are responsible for preventing terror attacks,''
he said.
   In addition, the number of Palestinians banned from traveling to
Israel for security or criminal offenses - now several thousand
people - will be increased, Shomron added.
   The upsurge in the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising, Shomron
said, is linked to the Oct. 8 shooting on Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, where Israeli police killed 20 Arab rioters and wounded
140. Five people have been killed and 11 wounded in subsequent
Arab-Jewish street violence.
   ``There are situations, as it happened after the Temple Mount,
in which an unusually large part of the population participates in
the events. A small part had also acted individually, carrying out
revenge attacks,'' Shomron said.
   Israel also expects an increase in cross-border guerrilla raids
following the Temple Mount shootings, he said.
   ``It is known that following the Temple Mount, there is a
greater motivation to act against Israel, to attack it from the
borders and not only within the territories or the Green Line,''
Shomron said in reference to Israel's pre-1967 borders. ``We have
no doubt that we can expect repeated (attack) attempts.''
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   These lands are the scene of the Palestinian revolt in which at
least 766 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians. Some 289 Arabs have been slain by fellow Palestinians as
alleged pro-Israeli collaborators. Fifty-one Israelis also have
died.

   Mikhail Gorbachev hinted today the Iraqi
leadership might be softening its hard-line position on the Persian
Gulf crisis, and reiterated that military force should not be used
to end the conflict.
   The Soviet president said indications from Iraq that its
position might be changing will be clarified in coming days, but he
did not elaborate.
   Gorbachev spoke at a joint news conference with Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez on the second day of a three-day visit to Spain,
the first to this country by a Soviet head of state.
   Emphasis on the crisis, which began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait, was expected to continue Sunday evening when Gorbachev
travels to Paris for a 24-hour visit that includes talks with
French President Francois Mitterrand.
   In the news conference, Gorbachev ruled out using military force
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. He cited the suffering such
action would cause the Iraqi people and the 3,000 Soviet
specialists remaining in Iraq.
   ``Until the very end, we must take advantage of everything
within our reach to find a peaceful solution to this problem,''
Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader's personal envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, is
scheduled to go to Baghdad on Sunday for the second time in a
month.
   Gorbachev also said there were indications there might be
changes in the hard-line position within the Iraqi leadership
toward the gulf crisis.
   ``In recent days, there are signals that in the Iraqi leadership
there is an understanding that solution of problems cannot be
achieved through ultimatums,'' Gorbachev said in Russian translated
into Spanish. ``I may be mistaken, and the coming days maybe will
bring some clarification.''
   The private French television station La Cinq said Friday that
Saddam had sent letters to both Mitterrand and Gorbachev expressing
his readiness to discuss Middle East problems, including Kuwait.
   French officials denied knowledge of any letters.
   Although the gulf crisis was expected to figure heavily in
talks, the Soviet leader hopes to come away from both Madrid and
Paris with solid assurance of economic assistance to his country's
collapsing economy.
   Among the Hispano-Soviet accords to be signed today was a $1.5
billion line of credit to Moscow for buying Spanish equipment to
modernize Soviet plants making clothing, food and construction
materials.
   Spain seeks guarantees in return from the Soviets on
facilitating hard currency transfers, the major stumbling block
faced by its 20 joint venture companies in the Soviet Union.
   Gonzalez and Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez plan
to inform their 11 European Community partners on Soviet economic
problems and the outcome of the gulf talks at the EC summit in Rome
later today.
   In a welcoming toast at a formal dinner Friday night honoring
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa, King Juan Carlos called the gulf
crisis ``perturbing and a cause for serious concern.''
   He went on to stress the importance of maintaining a solid
international front under United Nations auspices against the Iraqi
invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   Both Spain and the Soviet Union back U.N. sanctions against Iraq
and seek a political settlement to the crisis. Spain has sent a
navy frigate and two corvettes to the gulf region in support of the
U.N. trade embargo.

   Tourism Minister Kent Durr
supports a plan to convert the notorious Robben Island prison into
a tourist resort and park, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   African National Congress leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Walter
Sisulu and others were imprisoned on the island off Cape Town,
known for its harsh winter weather.
   The Saturday Star said a possible feature of the resort would
permit guests to stay in the Mandela Suite - the ANC leader's
former cell.
   A group of Cape Town businessmen have proposed converting the
island prison into a resort capable of accommodating 1,500 visitors
at a time and including a yacht club, golf course, tennis courts
and landing strip.
   One of the businessmen, Nick Malherbe, told the newspaper the
goal was to make Robben Island a national landmark.
   The government has not taken any steps to date to convert the
prison, which still is in operation.

   Voters returned to the polls today to
elect four provincial legislatures, a test of the right-wing
alliance that defeated Benazir Bhutto. Officials reported at least
25 deaths in clashes between rival parties.
   The provincial elections came three days after the Islamic
Democratic Alliance defeated Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan
People's Party by more than a 2-to-1 margin. That denied her a
second chance to lead this predominantly Moslem country of 110
million people.
   The 37-year-old former prime minister accused the army-backed
caretaker government of large-scale vote rigging, a charge that a
team of international poll watchers rejected.
   Despite unprecedented security, officials said at least 25
people were killed and as many as 100 injured in clashes between
rival parties, officials said. Most of the casualties occurred in
eastern Punjab Province, a longtime stronghold of Ms. Bhutto's
opponents.
   Election officials said turnout today among Pakistan's 50
million eligible voters was moderate to very light, and many
polling stations were empty. They reported heavy turnout in several
constituencies in Karachi, Ms. Bhutto's hometown.
   First results from the election were not expected before noon
EDT.
   The legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan and Northwest
Frontier provinces were disbanded Aug. 6, just hours after Ms.
Bhutto's 20-month-old government was dismissed on charges of
corruption and incompetence.
   More than 3,700 candidates are vying for 483 seats in the four
assemblies. Ms. Bhutto's party contested the election despite calls
by some loyalists to boycott.
   The Islamic Democratic Alliance is expected to sweep the
248-member assembly in eastern Punjab, the country's wealthiest and
most populous province and a longtime stronghold.
   The stakes were highest for Ms. Bhutto in Sindh, her home
province and political power base. Analysts say winning a majority
in the 109-member assembly was Ms. Bhutto's only hope of
maintaining any power.
   Sindh and its capital, Karachi, have been wracked by ethnic
violence that has claimed nearly 3,000 lives in the past five
years. Ms. Bhutto's inability to stop the relentless bloodshed was
one of the reasons cited by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan for
dismissing her government.
   About 100,000 soldiers, paramilitary troops and police have been
patrolling the country's most volatile areas during this week's
balloting. More than half have been deployed across Sindh.
   At least nine people were killed and more than 60 others injured
in clashes between rival parties during Wednesday's voting for the
National Assembly, the policy-making lower house of Parliament that
chooses Pakistan's prime minister.
   Ms. Bhutto and her supporters have charged the caretaker
government and her opponents of widespread vote tampering, alleging
ballot boxes were switched, party workers killed and election
officials attacked by armed gangs.
   But a 40-member observer team from the Washington-based National
Democratic Institute said Friday its preliminary findings showed no
evidence to support the contentions by Ms. Bhutto, who plans to
challenge the figures in court.
   Sartaj Aziz, finance minister in the caretaker government, said
Friday he hoped the observer team's observations would convince
Washington to reinstitute $573 million aid package.
   Washington suspended economic and military aid on Oct. 1,
demanding greater assurances from Islamabad that Pakistan neither
possesses or wants to possess nuclear weapons.

   The California gubernatorial campaign
is rushing into its final days on a tide of negative advertising,
as Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson jockey
for the lead in the neck-and-neck race.
   Feinstein is lashing out at Wilson's record in Congress, while
Wilson blasts Feinstein for negative campaigning in her attempt to
succeed retiring Gov. George Deukmejian.
   A new Feinstein ad describes how Wilson was wheeled into the
Senate on a gurney after a 1985 emergency appendectomy to cast the
deciding vote to freeze Social Security benefits.
   The audio portion of the ad has Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., quipping that Wilson votes better ``under sedation.''
   Wilson calls the ad ``the ugliest and most mean-spirited
commercial of 1990.'' His campaign describes it as ``a sign of
desperation'' by Feinstein.
   Wilson's commercials, meanwhile, feature segments of earlier
Feinstein commercials accompanied by news stories describing them
as fraudulent and dirty.
   The Los Angeles Times poll reported Feinstein ahead by 41
percent to 39 percent in September and Wilson overtaking her for a
42-41 lead in early October.
   Mervin Field's California Poll reports a 47-42 Wilson lead,
compared with 45-42 in September, while pollster Steve Teichner
found a 37-30 Wilson lead in mid-October, compared with 37-35 in
early October.
   President Bush was in California last week to campaign for
Wilson, but Wilson was in Washington as Congress put the finishing
touches on the budget-deficit reduction package.
   Wilson, who won re-election to the Senate in 1988, had been
harshly criticized by some for campaigning at home while Congress
had unfinished business.
   There have been no major issues in the campaign to clearly
differentiate the candidates.
   As a result, issues such as Wilson's attendance record in the
Senate and Feinstein's endorsement four years ago of controversial
former state Chief Justice Rose Bird have taken on significance in
the campaign.
   Both candidatss have tried to portray themselves as political
outsiders despite Wilson's 24 years as a state legislator, mayor
and U.S. senator, and Feinstein's 20 years as San Francisco
supervisor and mayor.
   It's been a campaign of limited candidate appearances and few
major speeches but endless television commercials and faxed press
releases magnifying small differences and manufacturing other
differences where none exist.
   They've battled inconclusively over who is most opposed to
hiring quotas, most supportive of law enforcement and the death
penalty, most dedicated to abortion rights and most concerned about
the environment.
   Wilson and Feinstein say raising taxes would be a last resort,
but both have refused to take a no-new-taxes pledge, which is a
significant acknowledgement of the dire fiscal problem the next
governor faces.
   They do disagree on which taxes they might raise, with Wilson
leaning to a sales tax increase and Feinstein to a higher top
income tax bracket.
   Polls report that the historic significance of Feinstein's bid
to become the state's first woman governor has faded as a campaign
factor as voters have sorted themselves out more along traditional
party lines.
   ``This race has reshaped itself, not into one about history
(whether to elect a woman governor), but in rather traditional
terms - liberals vs. conservatives and a battle for the
middle-of-the-road voters,'' said pollster Teichner.
   ``Historically, when elections break down to this level,
Republicans win,'' he said.
   Wilson's narrow lead appears to be based more on voters' second
thoughts about Feinstein than positive support for Wilson.
   ``I'm not sure this was ever Wilson's to win,'' said Teichner.
``It's hers to lose. It's her vote that has been the volatile
vote.''

   The arguments, scheduled for Tuesday, center on free-speech
issues and not the legality of abortion. But the hearing still may
give the first glimpses of Justice David Souter's stance on
abortion.
   At stake is the information available to the 5 million
low-income women who depend on federally funded clinics and similar
health-care providers.
   If any of these women faces an unwanted pregnancy, she has the
same three options confronting wealthier women: raise the child,
place the child for adoption or abortion.
   But if the Bush administration wins in the Supreme Court,
doctors and counselors at some 4,000 federally financed family
planning clinics will be barred from discussing the third option
with their clients.
   Federal regulations adopted by the Reagan administration in 1988
imposed the ban on counseling about abortion, but court challenges
have kept the regulations from being enforced virtually everywhere.
   Last year, family planning clinics received more than $140
million in federal money.
   A federal appeals court in New York upheld the ban, but other
federal courts have ruled it an unconstitutional infringement of
free-speech rights. After hearing arguments in the New York case
Tuesday, the Supreme Court is expected to resolve the conflicting
rulings by July.
   Souter joined the court earlier this month, succeeding Justice
William Brennan. During confirmation hearings, he declined to state
whether he would vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling
that legalized most abortions. Tuesday's arguments will be the
first for Souter on abortion since he joined the federal bench.
   The high court is not the sole battlefield. Legislation to sweep
away the counseling ban was introduced in Congress last week, and
is expected to be reintroduced when the new Congress convenes in
January.
   ``I don't think this is so much a pro-choice or pro-life
question,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., a sponsor of a House
bill to lift the ban. ``It's really a matter whether people should
be told the whole truth.''
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who sponsored a similar bill in the
Senate, said ``Nobody's arguing that any (taxpayer) money can be
spent for abortions. It's a question of counseling, of providing
full information.''
   The family planning program, enacted by Congress as Title X of
the Public Health Service Act, pays for creating and operating the
clinics. For most clinics, federal money accounts for only a
portion - perhaps 10 percent - of their budgets.
   The clinics always have been barred from using federal money to
perform abortions, but regulations originally let the clinic staffs
tell women about the abortion option and make referrals.
   After those regulations drew criticism from anti-abortion
groups, the Reagan administration said the clinics may not
``encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family
planning'' or distribute written materials on abortion.
   Under the 1988 regulations, a woman who visited a federally
funded family planning clinic and asked about abortion would have
to be told that the clinic staff ``does not consider abortion an
appropriate method of family planning.'' Counselors or doctors then
could offer help in obtaining prenatal care.
   ``The government wants to abuse the counselor-patient
relationship,'' said Rachael Pine, a lawyer representing Planned
Parethood and others who attacked the 1988 regulations. ``They are
taking unfair advantage in the marketplace of ideas.''
   But lawyer John W. Whitehead, who on behalf of The Rutherford
Institute urged the justices to uphold the 1988 regulations, said
they ``do not restrict speech unless it is financially supported by
the use of federal funds.''
   ``The correct question,'' Whitehead said, ``is whether Title X
projects may utilize federal funds to financially support abortion
speech through abortion advocacy and counseling.'' He said the
answer should be no.
   Although the regulations were fueled by the politics of
abortion, the Supreme Court case is more about freedom of speech.
   Those attacking regulations say they interfere impermissibly
with the rights of clinic staffs and patients by imposing a kind of
``viewpoint discrimination.''
   But the Bush administration and others say the government, when
spending taxpayer money, may choose to favor some types of speech
over others.
   A similar debate is being aired over anti-obscenity curbs on the
federally subsidized National Endowment for the Arts.

   The Inter-American Development Bank said
Saturday that Latin America must continue free-market economic
programs advocated by the Bush administration if the region is to
be fully integrated into the global economy.
   In its annual Social and Economic Report, the development bank
also said that getting rid of poverty is essential to the future of
participatory politics in the region.
   Eliminating poverty ``is an enormous task'' the report said,
that will require creative coordination between public and private
sectors.
   The Economic Commission for Latin America, the bank's sister
organization, estimated in 1989 that 44 percent of the people in
Latin America were poor - nearly 183 million people.
   The United States has provided $21.1 billion to the
Washington-based bank since it was set up in 1959 in partnership
with Latin American nations. The economic commission is a United
Nations think tank for Latin America based in Santiago, Chile.
   Now that all Latin American nations have democratically elected
governments, the Bush administration has said it is time for them
to move away from state-controlled economies with bloated
bureaucracies that strangle private enterprise.
   President Bush has suggested that Western Hemisphere countries
interested in building up a market economy form a free-trade zone.
Next month he plans to visit Mexico to formally open negotiations
and in early December is scheduled to visit Brazil, Chile, Uruguay,
Venezuela and Argentina.
   The economic transition to free market economies has been
painful for many Latin American nations because it eliminated
benefits such as subsidies for housing, hospitals, transportation,
electric power, phone services and almost all other major public
utilities.
   Welfare policies were based mainly on borrowed money and
collapsed in 1983 when most Latin American countries found they
were unable to repay credits.
   The development bank said: ``The state will continue to be
called upon to respond to the special need of vulnerable groups;
the issues will be how effectively it can deliver services, how
effectively it can reach intended target populations, and how well
it can work with, or complement the activities of, the private
sector to improve productivity.''
   Bush asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas A. Brady to review past
policies with Latin American countries to facilitate their
transition to open economies. But the debt problems remain - the
World Bank estimates foreign debt in the region rose $7 billion to
$434 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>James Merrill Wins First Library of Congress Poetry Prize in 42
Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poet, novelist and playwright James Merrill on
Saturday was awarded the national poetry prize from the Library of
Congress. It was the first time the library had been allowed to
grant prizes since an uproar over the 1948 winner.
   Merrill, 64, who lives in Stonington, Conn., will receive a
$10,000 stipend from the new Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize
for Poetry, established in memory of former President Lyndon B.
Johnson's sister.
   The Bobbitt Prize is the only poetry award given by a national
institution, the library said. It will be awarded every other year
to recognize the most distinguished book of American poetry
published during the preceding two years.
   Merrill received the prize for ``The Inner Room,'' a volume of
poetry published in 1988. His nine previous poetry books have won
two National Book Awards, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry and the
Pulitzer Prize, awarded in 1977 for his ``Divine Comedies.''
   The library's last poetry prize provoked a furor in Congress and
the press 42 years ago because the recipient was Ezra Pound, who
made pro-fascist, anti-Semitic radio broadcasts from Italy in World
War II and subsequently was indicted for treason.
   Pound, an American who spent most of his life in Europe, was
being held at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a Washington, D.C., mental
institution, when a jury of prominent American writers selected him
for the first $1,000 Bollingen Prize in Poetry for his ``Pisan
Cantos'' in 1948.
   As a result of the ensuing controversy, Congress prohibited the
Library of Congress from giving any more prizes or awards. The ban
included not only the Bollingen Prize, which was awarded in later
years by Yale University, but the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal
for chamber music and three prizes endowed by Lessing Rosewald for
annual exhibitions of prints.
   The charges against Pound were dismissed in 1958 and he returned
to Italy, where he died in 1972. The ban was lifted in 1988 at the
request of Librarian of Congress James H. Billington.
   Congress gave the library approval to resume awarding prizes
``in recognition of exceptionally meritorious achievements in the
life of the mind, including works in biography, history, fiction,
poetry and drama.''
   The Bobbitt Prize honors the memory of Becky Johnson, a
Washington graduate student and sister of the late president, who
worked in the library's cataloging department in the 1930s.
   She fell in love with a fellow library worker, college student
O.P. Bobbitt, after a courtship involving the surreptitious
exchange of notes on catalog index cards. They married and returned
to Texas.
   After her death, Bobbitt's son, Philip, said he and his father
endowed the poetry prize as a memorial to his mother, with the
Library of Congress as trustee, ``owing to the history of the
courtship ... and my mother's love of poetry.''
   Besides writing 10 volumes of poetry, Merrill has written two
novels, two plays and a book of essays. He has taught at Bard
College, Yale University, Amherst College and the University of
Wisconsin.
   He will give a public reading from ``The Inner Room'' at the
Library of Congress on Monday evening.

   With nine of its 10 unions on strike, the Daily
News managed to publish for a second day in a row, and said it
would move to replace strikers as quickly as possible.
   Reporters and other editorial employees in the 800-member
Newspaper Guild joined the violence-wracked strike Friday rather
than accept a management mandate to cross co-workers' picket lines
at the money-losing tabloid.
   The newspaper's 700-member drivers' union called the strike
Thursday night after 60 senior drivers were fired and replaced with
non-union workers.
   The workers had walked out early Thursday, and were then locked
out by management, after a worker who said he was disabled was
ordered to stand rather than sit while doing his job.
   The strike quickly turned violent as newspaper delivery trucks
and buses carrying replacement workers were pelted with rocks,
bottles and firebombs.
   On Thursday and Friday, 40 News trucks were damaged, 11 of them
firebombed, and eight buses carrying replacement workers were also
attacked, said News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson.
   Two strikers were charged with reckless endangerment after cars
and buses carrying replacement workers were pelted with rocks
Friday night as they drove from the newspaper's Brooklyn printing
plant, said police Officer Mark Warren.
   Four other strikers were arrested in Brooklyn early today after
a Daily News delivery truck driver flagged down a passing police
car and said he was being followed by two cars.
   The four, all men in their 20s and 30s, were charged with
weapons possession when a .22-caliber automatic and a shotgun were
found during a search of the cars, said police Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
They were also charged with reckless endangerment; criminal
possession of an explosive device - a powerful firecracker; and
possession of dangerous instruments - in this case, golf balls.
   In all, 12 people were arrested in New York City in News-related
incidents today by 8 a.m., Wrensen said. At least 11 people had
been arrested Friday.
   In Queens, a driver was hit with baseball bat and taken to
Elmhurst Hospital in good condition. A 25-year-old man was charged
in that incident, Wrensen said.
   Daily News director of labor relations Edward Gold said Friday
that the newspaper would begin replacing employees who don't arrive
for work ``as soon as possible.''
   ``Their action in replacing workers is illegal,'' Guild Local 3
President Barry Lipton said after a meeting with some 200 members.
``Now, we bring this newspaper to its knees.''
   ``The Daily News is dead as far as we're concerned,'' said
George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
the umbrella for the News' unions. ``The boycott is on.''
   He said the unions hoped to force a sale of the News to someone
with whom they could negotiate. Union contracts expired in March.
   The News has taken a hard line in its negotiations, saying it
must eliminate labor abuse to save $50 million to $70 million
annually. The unions say the paper is trying to break them.
   The New York Typographical Union was the only one of the
newspaper's 10 unions to not honor the strike. Its 200 members have
been guaranteed lifetime jobs.
   The News, using management and replacement workers, said it
printed and distributed 611,000 copies of Friday's paper.
   It wasn't immediately known how many copies were printed today,
but nine trucks left the newspaper's Garden City, N.Y., plant with
190,000 newspapers early today, according to a News source who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Trucks also began rolling out of
the Brooklyn and Kearny, N.J., plants this morning, the source
said.
   The newspaper's normal daily circulation is 1.18 million, making
the News the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily after the
Los Angeles Times.
   The News has lost about $115 million and seen daily circulation
slip by about 700,000 in the past 10 years.

<HEAD>Prelude '92: Conservatives Sought Kemp Cabinet Exit to Champion
Their Cause</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Tax Odyssey, Bjt</HEAD>

   Restive anti-tax conservatives, feeling
betrayed by President Bush, have tried - without success - to get
Jack Kemp to quit the Cabinet and campaign against any budget
compromise that boosts tax rates.
   A possible 1992 Republican challenge to Bush was not part of the
discussion, but it clearly is on the minds of many conservatives.
   ``If no one else steps forward,'' said one conservative, who
insisted on anonymity, ``some Republican congressman will file in
New Hampshire (for the 1992 presidential primary).
   ``He'll go up there and say, `Look, I know I'm not going to be
elected president, but if you want to tell George Bush you don't
want your taxes increased, vote for me.' In a place like New
Hampshire he'd get a significant vote.''
   While swiftly rejecting the plea that he bolt the
administration, Kemp met with Bush and told the president he could
not campaign for a budget compromise that contained tax increases.
   The housing secretary offered to quit the Cabinet if the
president found his position untenable for a member of the
administration. But Bush said he wanted Kemp to stay on and asked
him not to go public with his opposition.
   Even with that admonition, Kemp has found it difficult to
restrain his anti-tax, populist views when campaigning for
Republicans across the country.
   During one recent appearance in Iowa, Kemp warned against
letting the GOP become ``a Hoover party of austerity, sacrifice,
pain, raising taxes and trying to satisfy the markets.''
   As a congressman and as a candidate for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination, Kemp was an ardent advocate of lower
taxes. He was a principal sponsor of the 1981 tax cut bill.
   Other 1988 rivals of Bush are less restrained.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont said he also has been
approached by people urging him to carry the anti-tax message to
the country.
   In an interview, Du Pont called the latest budget compromise ``a
terrible bill that will retard growth and raise our taxes and it
won't cut spending a whit and it's put an enormous blemish on the
Republican Party.''
   The former two-term governor dropped out of the race for the
1988 Republican presidential nomination after the New Hampshire
primary.
   He said he has been speaking out. ``It's just that you guys
never write it down anymore.''
   Du Pont predicted that there will be ``a substantial debate
between the members of the Republican Party and its leadership'' on
the tax issue in the upcoming months.
   But he rejected the idea that Bush would face a challenge to his
renomination.
   ``I think the president understands the mistakes that have been
made,'' said Du Pont. ``I think you'll see after this election that
the president will take those lessons to heart.
   ``I think he's learned from this debate that there are a lot of
Republicans out there who are willing to stand up for the things he
ran on. So, I don't think he'll get challenged. I think he'll win
re-election.''
   A third 1988 presidential candidate, Pat Robertson, has been
silent on the budget controversy, but has made it known that he is
unhappy with aspects of the Bush presidency. Robertson is regarded
as likely to consider a conservative challenge to Bush.
   Hard-line conservatives like Richard Viguerie, who have always
opposed Bush, were apoplectic about the budget compromise.
   ``Bush's budget deal was the last straw,'' Viguerie said in a
statement issued late in the week. ``It was the opening volley in a
civil war that will pit Bush and Congress against middle America,
and Republican against Republican.''
   Two presidents in recent history were challenged from within
their party and both beat back the effort but then lost the general
election.
   Gerald Ford defeated Ronald Reagan at the 1976 GOP convention,
but then lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Four years later, Carter
turned back a challenge from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and then was
defeated in November by Reagan.

<HEAD>UAW to Cancel Contract Extension at Chrysler; Ford, UAW Ink New
Pact</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with UAW giving notice to
Chrysler officials that it will cancel contract extension Monday.

   The United Auto Workers union told Chrysler Corp.
it is canceling a contract extension under which the automaker's
63,000 union members have been working since Sept. 15.
   The move, which will become effective at midnight Monday unless
a new temporary extension is agreed to before then, raises the
possibility that the union would call a walkout at the financially
struggling automaker.
   The so-called three-day letter was given to company officials
Friday night, said UAW spokesman Bob Barbee.
   ``This is a notification of a termination of the extension,''
Barbee said today. ``But it still can be extended on a day-to-day
notice.''
   He refused to say if the letter increases the likelihood of a
strike.
   Meanwhile, negotiations continued today, mostly in subcommittees
focusing on specific areas of the contract. The union is seeking a
new three-year contract to replace the one that expired last month.
   On Friday, UAW President Owen Bieber and Ford Chairman Harold
Poling signed their new three-year agreement, which is similar to
one Bieber and General Motors Corp. Chairman Robert Stempel signed
a week ago.
   The union is using those contracts as models for the Chrysler
contract. But Chrysler has said it may not be able to afford the
so-called pattern agreement.
   Bieber on Friday refused to discuss the progress of talks with
Chrysler.
   ``I'm here to sign the Ford agreement,'' he said.
   The council, made up of UAW local presidents and bargaining
committee chairs, could be briefed on the status of negotiations,
asked to approve a tentative contract or set strike strategy.
   Among the main sticking points in the talks is retiree costs,
including pensions and health care.
   Pension costs were on Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca's mind
during a preview Friday of a yet-to-be-finished $1 billion Chrysler
Technology Center in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit.
   ``Right now, I'm wrestling with the union on a $1.5-billion
premium over General Motors over pensions,'' he said. Chrysler
spokesman Lee Sechler declined to discuss Iacocca's remark, saying
the company would not talk about issues pending in the
negotiations.
   Chrysler, which has about 60,000 retirees and about 63,000
active workers, has said since talks began in mid-July that its
retiree costs are higher than GM's or Ford's.
   The GM and Ford agreements call for, among other things,
lump-sum payments to current retirees and surviving spouses, a
method for increasing pension payments for workers who retired
before Oct. 1, 1979, and increases in the amount future retirees
will get.
   Although the UAW-Chrysler contract is far from wrapped up,
events in Canada have tempered talk of a strike.
   The Canadian Auto Workers union, like the UAW, sought basically
the same contract with each of the Big Three automakers' operations
there. The UAW and the CAW each negotiated agreements first with GM
and Ford before turning to Chrysler in an apparent move to put more
pressure on the No. 3 automaker and its Canadian subsidiary to
agree to the pattern contract.
   The CAW and Chrysler agreed to a pattern contract Thursday.

<HEAD>New Medical Technology Allows Women To Turn Back Biological Clock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ricki Bingham never doubted she would have a child, but when the
time finally felt right she was 37 years old. And it was too late.
   ``I saw a future in which I was childless ... and it was
terrifying,'' said Bingham, one of thousands of women each year who
undergo premature menopause.
   No one had warned the Hyattsville, Md., woman that putting off
pregnancy could mean forfeiting the experience altogether.
   She despaired until discovering a new medical procedure that
offers post-menopausal women a chance to turn back their biological
clocks.
   Bingham, who did her homework on infertility, became pregnant 14
weeks ago after undergoing the new procedure in which her husband's
sperm was mixed with a younger donor's egg - in this case her
sister's - and placed in the hormone-stimulated womb.
   ``Ten years ago I would have run out of options,'' said Bingham,
40, a contractor with the U.S. Energy Department.``It's a miracle
that something like this is possible. But you also have to
understand what the negatives are.''
   The new procedure, detailed last week in the New England Journal
of Medicine, enables women well into their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s
to bear children.
   The woman undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery, but because
the egg is taken from a donor, she is not the genetic parent.
   The technology also raises questions about the wisdom of
deferring childbearing into a woman's later years, when such risks
as high blood pressure and premature labor are higher.
   Infertility specialists aren't recommending the new technology
as a routine alternative to natural conception. The procedure costs
$8,000 and finding donors, who receive an additional $1,500, can be
very difficult.
   ``If I were in front of a group of 31-year-old women, I'd
suggest they seriously think about initiating their attempt at
conception in the near future,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a
reproductive medicine specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
New York.
   ``This form of therapy is a last chance,'' said Sandler, whose
clinic has created 50 post-menopausal pregnancies over the last two
years. ``For a woman who has lost her reproductive capacity, it is
a way to take a baby home.''
   But what happens after that baby arrives home? Do older women
have the stamina necessary to chase after toddlers? Will they live
long enough to see those toddlers grow into adulthood?
   ``You wonder what our children will be like,'' said Wendy
Fiering, a 42-year-old architect who has been trying to get
pregnant.
   ``I'm very excited about all the advances,'' the Cambridge,
Mass., resident said. ``But this reproductive experience has made
me realize that ... when all is said and done, the younger years
are probably what it's designed for.''
   That is not to say, all the women agreed, that motherhood
belongs to a particular age group. Connie Chung and Glenn Close are
just two of many women who have pursued over-40 pregnancies.
   Still, to manipulate the biological clock is to tamper with one
of nature's absolutes. Some women said the idea of artificially
delaying life's cycles is troubling.
   Although menopause generally occurs around age 50, the ovaries
have stopped working in up to 10 percent of women by age 40. And
for those women, the new in vitro technology comes as a blessed
second chance.
   ``It's not about having it all,'' said Beth Hall, who directs
the Northern California chapter of Resolve Inc., a national
infertility support and information network.
   ``It's for those of us that are in that late childbearing age
range, the baby boomers who grew up being able to accomplish what
we wanted,'' said Hall, who adopted a baby girl after
unsuccessfully undergoing fertility treatment.
   ``Our mothers were not out there to say, `Look, if you choose to
pursue a career there is risk associated with that,'' said Patty
Delaney, who had her first child at 34 and began having menopausal
hot flashes a year later.
   ``I'd figured I had plenty of time,'' said Delaney, 47, who
lives in Washington and administers federal AIDS programs. ``So
whe I was told I probably would not have another child, I had to
acknowledge the years I could have ... but chose not to.'''
   Though she finds the ``genetic roulette'' troubling, Delaney
said she might have considered the new in vitro procedure 10 years
ago. But since her early menopause, she has been diagnosed with
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer.
   ``We've been the cutting edge generation and it's painful,''
Delaney said. ``It's wonderful that women have more choices. Now we
have to share them with our sons and daughters. We have to tell
them: `Be advised. Know that if you choose (to postpone pregnancy)
you may face adversity.'''

<HEAD>America Moves Back Its Clocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For those befuddled by late-starting church
services or football games, be reminded - America moved back in
time Sunday.
   Most of the nation changed from Daylight Saving to Standard time
at 2 a.m., local time, shifting an hour of sunlight from evening to
morning.
   For those who remembered to set their clocks back one hour
before going to bed Saturday night, that meant an extra hour of
sleep. For a few - police officers, bartenders and overnight
telephone operators - the switch saddled them with an extra hour of
nighttime duty.
   The time change, first tried in 1918 and institutionalized with
the Uniform Time Act of 1966, is designed to give a little more
winter light to youngsters waiting for early-morning school buses
and farmers rising for their break-of-dawn chores.
   The time change did not affect a few states that do not observe
daylight time. The Uniform Time Act allows states to exempt
themselves, and Hawaii, Arizona and parts of Indiana have opted out
of the system.
   Daylight Saving time returns on the first Sunday of April.

<HEAD>Zulus March to Protest Alleged Police Harassment</HEAD>

   Thousands of Zulus waving
axes, spears and clubs marched through downtown Johannesburg on
Saturday to protest alleged police harassment of their Inkatha
Freedom Party.
   ``Inkatha is the people's party!'' they chanted as they marched
and occassionally jogged down Commissioner Street, one of
Johannesburg's main thoroughfares.
   The street, which normally would have been crowded with Saturday
shoppers, cleared as the boisterous demonstrators arrived. Many
onlookers crowded into the small shops lining the street or huddled
in doorways as the mass of whooping, chanting marchers passed.
   The protesters wore red headbands and waved their traditional
tribal weapons.
   They marched to police headquarters, where Inkatha Youth leader
Themba Khoza read a page-long statement to the station commander,
who listened silently on the other side of iron bars.
   ``Inkatha members are being harassed by the South African police
in both the hostels and townships. This must stop,'' Khoza said.
   He suggested the police force was ``trying to appease certain
political organizations and is being intimidated by them.''
   He apparently referred to the African National Congress,
Inkatha's main rival. Fighting between supporters of Inkatha and
the ANC has killed thousands of blacks since 1985 in eastern Natal
Province.
   The violence spread to black townships around Johannesburg in
August, killing about 800 blacks in two months.
   The ANC has also accused police of bias, alleging they have
supported Inkatha in the fighting.
   The station commander, Col. D.B. Keyter, told Khoza he would
forward the petition to Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. Keyter
also told Khoza, ``We are not involved in politics whatsoever.''
   The Inkatha statement also complained its members were being
arrested for carrying their traditional weapons, which the marchers
proudly displayed.
   These included pangas, or machetes; knobkerries, wooden sticks
with a knob at the top; sjamboks, or whips; spears; and shields.
There was also at least one shovel in the crowd, and an iron bar
with a soft-drink can stuck on the end.
   Inkatha's statement said the police action was hurting chances
for peace between black factions.
   Police estimated the crowd at 6,000, but observers put the
figure at 8,000 to 10,000. It was an unusual show of Inkatha force
in Johannesburg, an ANC stronghold. Most of Inkatha's supporters
are Zulus from Natal Province.
   The police presence was light. Soldiers with automatic weapons
stood on some street corners but did not interfere, and officers
reported no incidents.
   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid but differ on tactics
to fight it. In addition to protesting police actions, the march
was a show of support for Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in
his rivalry with the ANC leadership.
   ``Mandela go away! Sisulu go away!'' the crowd chanted,
referring to ANC leaders Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu.
   Mandela, meanwhile, arrived in Tokyo on Saturday for his first
visit to Japan. The visit was part of a world tour to lobby for
continuing support for the anti-apartheid movement.
   During his six-day visit, the 72-year-old deputy president of
the African National Congress is scheduled to address a session of
Japan's Parliament and meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
other officials.

<HEAD>Bush on Taxes: The Democrats Made Me Do It</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I'm the one who won't raise your taxes,''
George Bush told cheering Republicans in New Orleans on Aug. 18,
1988. Twenty-six months later, he's blaming Democrats for making
him do it.
   And Republicans this time are doing little cheering.
   Completing the abandonment of his combative anti-tax campaign
pledges, Bush now is apparently ready to sign a bipartisan
deficit-reduction package that would raise taxes by nearly $140
billion over five years.
   It's the latest step in a long odyssey of mixed signals and
wavering stands on taxes.
   Hoping to mop up some of the political damage and quell
rebellion within the GOP ranks, Bush is trying to promote
Republican unity with less than two weeks to go before the midterm
elections.
   When he accepted his party's nomination, Bush declared:
   ``The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and
they'll push, and I'll say no. And they'll push again. And I'll say
to them: Read my lips. No new taxes.''
   But his message now, as he travels around the country stumping
for GOP candidates, seems to be that Congress just pushed too hard.
   Or, as it's become known around the White House, the broccoli
defense.
   ``You know my feelings on taxes. I like taxes just about as much
as I like broccoli,'' he told a GOP fund-raiser in Stamford, Conn.,
last week. He repeats the line often.
   ``I'm not defending tax increases. I'm saying that the president
accepted what I call the tax-broccoli requirement that was imposed
on him in order to get a $500 billion deficit-reduction package,''
said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the
condition of anonymity.
   Speaking Friday in Irvine, Calif., Bush blamed Democratic
leaders for presiding over ``an uncontrolled spending binge for
years.'' And, he said, ``I've had to compromise (on taxes). I
haven't liked that a bit.''
   Some analysts see Bush's blaming of Democrats for the breaking
of his campaign promise as a tactic likely to backfire - and to
make him appear even more indecisive.
   ``Ronald Reagan made deals with Democrats all the time,
including deals on new taxes. But he never said, `they made me do
it.' He just declared victory for himself,'' said Norman Ornstein,
a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute.
   ``It wasn't just that Bush abandoned his campaign pledge. It was
that he did it in such a maladroit fashion,'' Ornstein added.
   But it wasn't the first time. Bush, after all, had pronounced
Reagan's call for large tax cuts in the 1980 campaign as ``voodoo
economics,'' then became an overnight disciple of Reaganomics when
he joined the ticket.
   Bush's zigzags on taxes have baffled congressional tax writers
and some party strategists.
   ``It's become unclear just what the president believes,'' said
Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution. ``I
suppose I don't blame him for going out and trying to remind people
that the devil made him do it. But it seems a little disingenuous
to attack the Democrats after he's just cut a deal with them.''
   Some milestones of Bush's two-year meandering odyssey on taxes:
   - Aug. 18, 1988. He tells the GOP convention and the nation to
``read my lips,'' and reiterates his anti-tax stand repeatedly
throughout the campaign and his first year in office.
   - Jan. 29, 1990. Bush sends Congress a $1.23 trillion budget
that calls for $15.7 billion in new levies, but calls them mostly
``user fees'' and not ``new taxes.''
   - May 6. Bush summons four top congressional leaders to the
White House and convenes a ``budget summit'' with ``no
preconditions.''
   - June 26. Budget talks stall and Bush, trying to get them
moving again, clarifies that ``no preconditions'' will mean ``tax
revenue increases.''
   - Sept. 30. Bush supports a bipartisan deficit-cutting plan that
includes $134 billion in tax increases over five years - but which
leaves income tax rates on the wealthiest Americans at the current
28 percent.
   - Oct. 2. Bush makes a television pitch to the nation to drum up
support for the leadership plan, calling ``economic chaos'' the
alternative and urging a suspension of partisan rhetoric.
   - Oct. 5. The House overwhelmingly rejects the plan.
   - Oct. 6. Bush is asked if he would drop his opposition to
higher income tax rates for the wealthy to get a new plan. ``We're
flexible,'' he says.
   - Oct. 9. Bush tells a news conference a deal coupling higher
income taxes for the wealthiest with lower capital gains rates is
``on the table.'' But later, he appears to recant under pressure
from GOP leaders. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., says Bush agrees
``that we will not go up on the rates no matter what.''
   - Oct. 10. Bush says ``Let Congress clear it up'' when asked
about his position.
   - Oct. 11. The president says he is willing to go to a top tax
rate of 31 percent on the wealthy if capital gains taxes are cut
even though ``I do not believe such a compromise is now possible.''
   - Oct. 25. Bush supports the emerging new bipartisan package,
which raises the top rate to 31 percent without a corresponding cut
in capital gains rates. He then accuses Democrats of months of
``demagogic attacks'' and begins a four-day campaign tour of
Democrat-bashing.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Number Of Crimes Unchanged Last Year, Rate Down From
1970s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burglaries dropped 7.3 percent last year while
motor vehicle thefts rose 11.4 percent, according to a government
survey of victims that indicated the total number of crimes was
virtually unchanged from 1988.
   The National Crime Survey released last week by the Justice
Department estimated that the number of personal crimes of violence
and theft against Americans dropped 1.4 percent last year while
household crimes including burglary and motor vehicle thefts
increased 1.9 percent from 1988.
   The rates of all types of crime covered by the survey, except
motor vehicle thefts, were lower in 1989 than in 1973, when the
first survey was completed, the Justice Department said.
   The rate of personal crimes was 20.9 percent below the 1973
level while household crimes were down 22 percent from 17 years
ago.
   Motor vehicle thefts were up 0.5 percent from 1973, a difference
the survey found was statistically insignificant.
   The estimated rate of violent crimes last year is 10.6 percent
below the survey's figures for 1973.
   The estimates, based on interviews with 97,000 Americans age 12
and older, contrast sharply with the picture of crime trends
painted in the FBI's latest compilation of state and local police
figures.
   The FBI's Uniform Crime Index found that violent crime soared 10
percent during the first half of 1990, with murders increasing 20
percent in the nation's largest cities.
   The FBI figures, released Oct. 19, are based on crimes reported
to authorities while the National Crime Survey includes crimes that
victims said they did not report to police.
   The 8 percent increase in murders in the FBI's crime index
results from the ``internecine war that occurs in the drug trade,
there is a lot of that,'' said Marvin Wolfgang, a criminologist at
the University of Pennsylvania.
   From his conversations with local police, Wolfgang said he is
convinced that drug trafficking has worsened since last year,
particularly in the largest cities where murders went up 20 percent
during the first half of 1990.
   He cited studies conducted in recent years showing that 65 to 70
percent of people arrested in New York, Washington and Philadelphia
tested positive for drugs.
   During the first half of 1990, New York City had 1,077 murders,
240 more than during the same period a year earlier, according to
FBI figures.
   There were 253 murders in Philadelphia during the period, up
from 205 in the first six months of 1989.
   Washington, which had a record 438 homicides in 1989, had 218
during the first half of this year, just one killing off last
year's six-month pace.
   So far this year, Washington has had 381 murders.
   The National Crime Survey, which does not include murders, found
that all other violent crimes decreased 0.8 percent last year from
1988.
   But within that category, rapes increased 6.3 percent and
robberies were up 4.2 percent. Assaults, however, dropped 2.1
percent, the survey found.
   The FBI report found that rapes increased 10 percent during the
first half of this year.
   Wolfgang said the recent surge in rape statistics is ``explained
by the greater willingness of people in the last five or 10 years
to report rape.''
   Studies show that only one in three victims of most crimes go to
the police, Wolfgang said. But only one in five rape victims
reports the crime to police, he said.
   The crime survey showed that burglaries dropped 7.3 percent
while other thefts, classified as household larcenies, rose 6.4
percent and motor vehicle thefts increased 11.4 percent.
   The survey estimated there were 19.69 million personal crimes
last year, down 1.4 percent from 19.96 million estimated in 1988.
The estimated number of household crimes increased from 15.8
million in 1988 to 16.1 million last year, the survey said.
   The victimization rate, calculated by counting the number of
crimes per 1,000 persons or households, was also lower last year
than it was in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Personal crimes occurred at a rate of 97.8 per 1,000 people last
year, compared to rates ranging from 116.3 per 1,000 people in 1980
to 128.9 per 1,000 in 1975, said the study by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics.

   Jim Bolger, a conservative who
wants to patch up relations with the United States, easily won
election Saturday as prime minister with his National Party scoring
a landslide win.
   The party capitalized on a faltering economy to end six years of
Labor rule in the South Pacific island nation of 3.5 million
people.
   Final unofficial results projected the National Party would
capture 68 seats in the 97-member Parliament, with Labor taking 28
and New Labor winning one. A handful of seats were close enough
that they still could be decided by absentee ballots.
   The National Party won 49 percent of the vote to 35 percent for
Labor. The Green Party, a relatively new political group that as
part of its policy has no official leader, was third with 7
percent, to 5 percent for New Labor.
   Voter turnout was 76 percent among the 2.1 million registered
voters.
   Prime Minister Mike Moore, who had held the post for only two
months, conceded defeat in a telephone to Bolger less than three
hours after the polls closed.
   Bolger, the 54-year-old son of Irish immigrants, immediately
spoke of reconciliation.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, from tonight, the politics of
inclusion begins. I want to include everyone in the great
challenges we face ... because we know there are some awesome
challenges ... facing our country,'' he said.
   Nearly 70 parties, nine of them considered major, contested the
nationwide elections.
   Many carried obscure names like Swinging Voters Outlet, Withered
Party, Legalize Marijuana and Citizens Against Political Parties
that had no chance of winning anything but attention.
   Several Cabinet ministers were among the Labor casualties.
   ``A lot of traditional voters have been alienated,'' said Jenny
Kirk, one of the Labor parliamentarians who lost her seat.
   Labor had a 56-40 majority in the outgoing Parliament, with New
Labor holding one seat.
   The National Party, which suffered a stinging defeat in 1987,
have dominated opinion polls the last two years. The party's
support has grown as disenchantment with Labor set in over high
unemployment, slow growth, high interest rates and other economic
woes.
   Moore had held out hopes of victory because the final polls
indicated nearly a quarter of the eligible voters were still
undecided just days before the election.
   Moore, 41, took over as prime minister when Geoffrey Palmer
resigned with polls indicating Labor trailing by 21 points and
heading for a landslide loss.
   At the time, Moore's backers were predicting Labor would retain
only 15 of its Parliament seats.
   Moore, the former external affairs and trade minister, worked
hard to reverse the poll deficit. He consistently ranked well above
Bolger when voters were asked who they favored for prime minister.
   But Labor was dragged down by a sagging economy and its
unpopular privatization efforts, which National branded as
``selling off the state silver to pay the bills.''
   Topping voter concerns was an unemployment rate at 7.9 percent,
the highest level since World War II.
   David Lange, the Labor prime minister who spearheaded the
anti-nuclear policy that led to an estrangement in ties with
Washington, had resigned 15 months ago, citing health reasons.
   Both Labor and the National Party pledged to continue the policy
of barring nuclear-powered ships and ships with nuclear weapons
from making port calls.
   But National also seeks some sort of reconciliation with
Washington, and Bolger was welcomed there at a time when other top
New Zealand officials were rebuffed.
   U.S. warships have not made port calls since the policy took
effect in 1984, because the Defense Department routinely refuses to
divulge whether particular ships are carrying nuclear weapons.
   In response to the policy, the United States in 1986 cut
high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped the country from
the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia.

<HEAD>French, British Tunnel Crews On The Verge Of First Linkup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historic rendezvous is expected this week under
the English Channel, when French and British construction crews
link up after three years of drilling the world's costliest tunnel.
   As early as Tuesday, perhaps a few days later, the two teams
will drive a probe through the last 100 yards of chalk that
separates them.
   After tests to verify the alignment of the separate parts of the
tunnel, full-scale boring operations will resume. The workmen are
expected to greet each other with handshakes within a few weeks.
   The 31-mile channel tunnel, dubbed the ``Chunnel,'' is scheduled
for completion in mid-1993. It actually consists of three tunnels -
two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between
them. Taking into account all three tunnels, 80 percent of the
drilling has been completed.
   The first linkup, in the service tunnel, is being described by
the French as a ``mouse hole'' - a bore only two inches in
diameter.
   When the service tunnel is fully connected, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Britain and French President Francois
Mitterrand are expected to meet each other in the middle.
   The two huge Japanese-designed boring machines used by each
construction team are to be left in perpetuity under the Channel.
French officials said it would cost more to extricate them then to
abandon them.
   The first linkup of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for
mid-1991.
   The goal of the project is to enable passengers to travel
between London and Paris in about three hours. That time is
comparable to flying if transport to and from airports is included,
and would take half as long as a car-ferry journey.
   The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of
$9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion in
case of unforeseen cost overruns.
   Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium that is building the
tunnel, announced Oct. 8 that it has reached an agreement with its
banks on $3.5 billion in new credit. More than 200 banks are
involved in the financing.
   Some of the French construction workers have staged strikes for
higher pay in recent days, including one on Saturday which about
100 men blocked other employees from entering the construction
area. Management has not said whether the strikes might delay the
mid-tunnel linkup.
   The Chunnel's scheduled debut in June 1993 would come six months
after the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining
trade barriers, becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million
consumers.
   Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in
the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a
profit until the end of the century.
   A study released Friday in Paris by transportation experts said
the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in wide
area of continental Europe. Some Britons have worries of a
different sort, fearing an influx of ills from the continent
ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
   Since construction began in late 1987, there have been seven
deaths on the British side of the tunnel and two on the French
side.
   Five British firms were ordered Wednesday to stand trial on
charges related to the death of a construction worker.
   Britain's Health and afety Executive is prosecuting the firms
following investigations into the death of a worker a year ago. The
trial date has not been set.

   For nearly three years, the stainless steel
legs of the Gateway Arch rose ever higher along the Mississippi
riverfront.
   Finally, workers put the last section into place on Oct. 28,
1965, forever silencing jokesters who had predicted the legs of the
giant ``croquet wicket'' would never meet.
   Twenty-five years and 64 million visitors later, the arch is
considered by many to be St. Louis' crowning glory. It has become
the nationally recognized symbol of the city, and civic leaders say
it was the catalyst for a rejuvenation of a decaying downtown.
   ``It's been probably the greatest single thing that has ever
happened to St. Louis,'' said Arthur Wright, a public relations man
who was one of the arch's earliest civic supporters.
   The 630-foot structure is the country's tallest national
monument. It is the centerpiece of the National Park Service's
Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, built to honor Thomas
Jefferson and his 1803 Louisiana Purchase, as well as the city's
role as the gateway to the West.
   The memorial cost $30 million, with the arch accounting for $12
million. The federal government paid three-fourths and the city the
rest.
   Since its opening in 1967, millions of people have ridden to the
observation room at the top in tram cars that travel slowly up the
inside of each leg, tilting to stay level.
   ``Amazed; in awe,'' said Ed Green, a recent visitor from Buford,
Ga. ``I pictured it just to be a concrete monument. I had no idea
you could go up inside of it. The view was excellent, very
peaceful.''
   The rangers who work at the arch have heard it all, but Lisa
Schober said she never tires of seeing people's reactions.
   ``It's always the same things,'' Schober said. ``From kids, it's
`awesome.' From older people, it's `I made it, I'm here.' ''
   The arch's architect, the late Eero Saarinen, came up with the
design while experimenting with pipe cleaners on his living room
floor. Its shape, in technical terms, is a catenary curve.
   It is designed to sway 9 inches one way or the other in 150 mph
winds. On windy days, when there are gusts up to 35 or 40 mph,
people in the top of the arch can feel it move several inches.
   But ``to most people, an inch feels like a foot,'' Schober said.
``Everybody thinks it's moving even when it's not.''
   ``The arch is as closely identified with St. Louis as the Eiffel
Tower is with Paris,'' said Ed Ruesing, president of Downtown St.
Louis Inc., the city's chamber of commerce.
   Business leaders say the arch revitalized downtown St. Louis,
which like other cities had experienced suburban flight during the
1950s and 1960s.
   During the last three decades, 50 office buildings have been
built downtown and more than 75 have been renovated - an investment
of more than $3 billion.
   ``I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the entire
redevelopment of downtown St. Louis has progressed from the
construction of the arch,'' Ruesing said. ``Real estate investors
ever since have scrambled to build as close to the arch as
possible.''
   The arch has drawn visitors from around the world, but as with
many monuments, some folks living in its shadow never get around to
seeing it.
   Clarence Liebman, 66, has lived in St. Louis most of his life
but until this month had never visited the arch.
   ``Remember, the lines were long the first 25 years,'' he said.

   Lebanese newspapers published birthday
letters to American journalist Terry Anderson on Saturday, his 43rd
birthday in captivity. One newspaper reported that fellow hostage
Terry Waite will be freed soon.
   Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his
sister, Peggy Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine,
Sulome's mother. They published the original English text so that
Anderson, who did not know Arabic when he was kidnapped, would be
able to read them if his kidnappers allowed him to.
   The newspaper ad-Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry
Waite would be freed either ``by the end of this month or within
the first half of the coming November, at the latest.''
   The short, front-page report attributed the information to an
unnamed security source. The conservative ad-Diyar is not known to
have special insight into the hostage issue, but the report was the
latest predicting Waite's release since Iran and Britain agreed to
restore diplomatic ties Sept. 27.
   Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987
after leaving his west Beirut hotel to negotiate with
representatives of Anderson's kidnappers.
   He is believed held by Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian group that
abducted Anderson.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   His birthday was marked by his colleagues as well as local and
foreign journalists with a somber gathering at the Associated Press
bureau. It was held in Anderson's office, which his colleagues
refer to as ``Terry's Room.''
   The staff sang ``Happy birthday, Dear Terry'' and blew out a
candle on a white cake.
   The newspapers also published an Arabic translation of Mrs.
Say's open letter to the captors, pleading with them to release
Anderson and the other captives.
   ``I beg you to release Terry and the others for humanitarian
reasons. Please, in honor of his birthday, give Terry and the
others the gift of freedom this year,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``His daughter Sulome, whom he has never seen, started school
last month. His daughter Gabrielle has matured from a child of 8 to
a young woman of 14,'' she added.
   Along with Sulome's hand-written letter, some papers published a
pencil drawing by the child, who was born 83 days after her
father's abduction. The drawing showed happy children playing.
   ``To Dad. I love you. Happy birthday. I go to proper school. I
do work, tracing, art, math. I can write and read. I love you,''
Sulome's letter said.
   Former Irish hostage Brian Keenan said after his release Aug. 24
that he had spent part of his four years in captivity with
Anderson, and he noted that Anderson has a photograph of Sulome and
was given letters from his family published in the press.
   ``Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak
with great pain and remorse and longing for his daughter,'' Keenan
said.
   Madeleine, addressing ``My Dearest Darling Terry,'' wrote:
   ``Another birthday, another year, another letter. A question I
ask myself every day and the answer I always want to give is `soon,
soon.'''
   In addition to Anderson and Waite, the Westerners missing in
Lebanon are five Americans, three Britons, two Germans and an
Italian.

   A fire broke out in a hospital as doctors were
making a vain attempt to revive a 13-month-old girl suffering from
a heart condition, authorities said. The girl died.
   The child, whose identity was not released, was brought to St.
Louis Children's Hospital by her parents when she became ill
Friday, officials said.
   The infant was critically ill and hospital personnel had been
trying to resuscitate her for about two hours when the fire broke
out when a spark from a heart-lung machine set a surgical drape
afire, the hospital said.
   Although the girl suffered burns on the legs and arms, the fire
was not believed to be the cause of death, said hospital spokesman
Dave Welborn.
   A nurse suffered smoke inhalation and was treated at the
hospital. Ten other babies in the pediatric intensive care unit
were evacuated and were not injured, the statement said.

<HEAD>House Approves New Deficit-Reduction Package</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 7th graf pvs, bgng: For all, to UPDATE

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nearly $250 billion deficit-reduction
package of tax increases and spending restraints supported by
President Bush and Democratic leaders was approved by the House
early today over the opposition of most Republicans.
   The 228-200 vote sent the bill to the Senate, which was to
consider it later in the day. The bill was supported by 181
Democrats and 47 Republicans; 74 Democrats and 126 Republicans
opposed it.
   ``The American people have had enough of ... (being told) that
somehow we can confront the deficit and it doesn't involve pain,''
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said in pleading for support.``The fact is that it does
and that is what this package is all about.''
   ``By doing this, we have reduced the debt on each of our kids by
$2,000,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Republicans complained that the plan, which includes the second
biggest tax increase in history, was being considered in the middle
of the night without members even having a chance to read it. And
they said the tax increases would just lead to more spending.
   ``Deficit reduction? It's almost an obscenity to call it that''
because the deficit would continue to rise, said Rep. Craig James,
R-Fla.
   For all the bill's problems, said House Republican Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois, ``The American people would rather have
imperfect progress than perfect paralysis.''
   President Bush, attending a summit of Pacific leaders in
Honolulu, told reporters he was ``very pleased it passed the
House.''
   He said many Republican members of the House ``had
understandable opposition to many of the individual provisions, but
I'm very pleased that it passed. I'm hoping it will get by the
Senate.''
   The new bill, the heart of a plan expected to shave $496 billion
off the federal deficit over the next five years, includes higher
taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcoholic beverages and certain luxury
goods. It would reduce spending for Medicare by about $44 billion,
curtail farm subsidies and shift a sizable portion of the federal
tax burden onto the well-to-do.
   ``I certainly think we have the votes in the Senate to pass
it,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance
Committee.
   The measure, which was passed by the House at 7 a.m. near the
end of a 21-hour work day, is so voluminous that one copy fills a
box the size of an apple crate.
   Senate passage would send the measure to Bush, who abandoned his
no-tax-increase pledge in the interest of deficit reduction.
   Disposal of the deficit plan and spending bills to keep the
government in operation over the next 11 months would clear the way
for adjournment of Congress until January.
   Congressional leaders continued negotiating with administration
officials right up to the time the deficit bill was sent to the
House floor for debate. The lingering hangups were not over the tax
provisions - making up the second largest tax increase in history -
but over how deeply to restrain spending on health programs.
   The bill would raise the 9-cent gasoline tax by 5 cents, double
the tax on beer to 32 cents a six-pack, raise taxes on wine and
liquor and impose a luxury tax a portion of the price of expensive
cars, jewels and furs.
   It would raise the top tax rate paid by the wealthiest people
from 28 percent to 31 percent, limit itemized deductions for people
over the $100,000 income level and gradually eliminate personal tax
exemptions for high-income taxpayers.
   The measure would raise taxes by $137.2 billion over the next
five years, Restraints in Medicare, Medicaid, farm subsidies and
other mandatory spending programs would raise the deficit reduction
in the bill to about $240 billion. Adding cuts in discretionary
spending, chiefly for the military, and interest savings due to
less borrowing would raise the total deficit package to $496
billion.
   That is shy of the $500 billion target agreed to early in the
summer by congressional leaders and the administration. The bill
falls short because the gasoline tax increase was scaled back and
some unpopular spending cuts were moderated.
   The measure is built around a plan worked out by top officials
during five months of negotiation. The first version was killed in
the House, principally because of even larger increases in gasoline
taxes and costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
   As Congress began the final push toward adjournment:
   -The House passed, 401-25, and sent to the Senate for final
action today a major revision of clean-air laws. The Senate passed
the measure 89-10 and sent it to Bush. The bill would cost an
estimated $22 billion a year to reduce smog, acid rain and
industrial pollution.
   -The Senate completed action on a $268 billion defense bill that
includes a scaling back of some weapons systems. The measure now
goes to President Bush for his signature.
   -Negotiators for the House and Senate reached a compromise on a
$25.5 billion foreign-aid bill. It includes Bush's request to
forgive $6.7 billion of Egypt's military debt to the United States.
   -On a voice vote, the House completed congressional action on a
measure that requires nutrition labels on packaged foods.
   While Congress neared completion of the massive bill to cut this
year's deficit, the Treasury Department reported that the red ink
for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30 totaled $220.4 billion - up
43.7 percent from the previous year.
   The administration is predicting this year's deficit will total
a record $254 billion if the deficit-reduction package becomes law.
Without the tax increases and spending restraints, which would
total about $40 billion this year, the deficit would hit almost
$294 billion.
   By the end of the next five years, the current $3.1 trillion
national debt is expected to be $5 trillion.

   President Bush is taking time out from
cross-country politicking to meet with leaders of 11 Pacific island
nations worried that their region could become a dumping ground for
old U.S. chemical weapons.
   ``I think it's a good time and I think it's about time that an
American president sat down with the heads of these countries out
there and tell them that we are as one in our respect for and love
of the Pacific,'' Bush said Friday night.
   Today's meeting comes during a two-day stop in Hawaii, where
Bush lent a hand to Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki's bid to unseat
Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka. She stayed in Washington as the House
debated the budget bill, but sent a videotape in which she thanked
Bush for stopping the use of the island of Kahoolawe as a bombing
range.
   The House passed the deficit-reduction package in a 228-200 vote
at 7 a.m. EDT.
   Bush, who arose for an early morning swim in the balmy sunshine
outside his resort hotel in Honolulu, was asked by reporters for
reaction to the budget agreement.
   ``I'm very pleased it passed the House,'' Bush said as he shook
the water out of his t-shirt and shorts. A small crowd of tourists
followed as he crossed the beach to the hotel.
   He said many Republican members of the House ``had
understandable opposition to many of the individual provisions, but
I'm very pleased that it passed. I'm hoping it will get by the
Senate.''
   Bush came to Hawaii from a pair of campaign appearances in
Southern California, where he verbally bludgeoned the Democrats who
control Congress for ``age old-tax-and-spend plicies.'' He also
accused them of lacking commitment to civil rights.
   The agenda at today's Pacific summit included discussion of the
hazards involving destruction of U.S. chemical munitions at
Johnston Atoll, a U.S.-held ring of islands 825 miles southwest of
Hawaii.
   Those invited to participate included the leaders of Fiji,
Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Western Samoa,
the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and
Tuvalu.
   For months, Pacific islanders have expressed concern about plans
to destroy chemical weapons from American military bases in Europe
and Asia at a giant new incinerator on Johnston Atoll.
   Two Navy ships carrying 100,000 artillery shells packed with
nerve agents, the Army's stockpile from West Germany, are expected
to reach the atoll next month.
   All U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles outside the mainland are
stored either on the atoll or in West Germany.
   The government insists it will neither make Johnston Atoll a
permanent toxic waste-disposal site nor maintain chemical weapons
there. But it does intend to destroy the munitions stored there and
those en route from Germany.
   U.S. officials have promised to carry out the operation in an
environmentally sound manner, and ``as safe as humanly possible,''
according to a State Department fact sheet on the problem.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to destroy
such weapons by 1997.
   Environmental groups oppose the destruction, and the South
Pacific Forum, an organization of regional governments, has
complained the plan could make the region ``the toxic waste
disposal center of the world.''
   The forum's chairman, Prime Minister Geoffrey A. Henry of the
Cook Islands, said the Johnston Atoll issue would be the top theme
on the summit agenda.
   ``It's of great importance to the people here,'' said Bob
Wernet, spokesman for Rep. Saiki. The Hawaii congresswoman supports
allowing the destruction of the chemicals already en route from
Europe and already stockpiled on the atoll, but not allowing any
stockpiles to be shipped from the mainland as of next year. She has
introduced legislation in Congress to that effect.
   Tests of the incinerator are to end late next year, and
full-scale incineration is expected to begin in 1992.
   The island leaders also were expected to press Bush to sign the
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which would ban the
testing, dumping and storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste
in the region.
   Before leaving for Hawaii, Bush on Friday attempted to distance
himself from the tax increases his administration negotiated with
Congress for a deficit-reduction package. He said the legislative
branch was to blame for the ``strong medicine'' Americans now have
to take.
   Speaking at a luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson's GOP gubernatorial
campaign in Los Angeles, Bush also accused Congress of trying to
embarrass him on the civil rights issue.
   He vetoed the sweeping anti-job discrimination bill passed by
Congress, claiming its provisions would force businesses to
establish minority hiring quotas. Sponsors strongly denied that,
but they fell one vote short in the Senate in an attempt Wednesday
to override the veto.
   Bush sent Congress an alternative bill that civil rights
advocates said guts their legislation. Administration officials
have privately claimed that Democrats want to use the veto as an
election issue.
   Bush said lawmakers were ``sitting around up there now. They
could pass it (his alternative) in 20 minutes if there was a
genuine interest in civil rights and less interest in trying to
embarrass the president of the United States.''

<HEAD>Quakes Gets Subdued Response From Neighbors of Long Valley Volcano</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years after a volcano scare incited
fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are
nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is
triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes.
   Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic
eruption. But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so ``you
don't really think about it,'' said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.
   ``You can get hit by a car,'' she said. ``You can be in a plane
crash. The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of
being killed by an earthquake or a volcano.''
   ``People who are frightened left long ago. I don't believe it's
a conscious concern of anyone in the community,'' said Mammoth
Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper.
   The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley,
a 19-mile-long, 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera. It
is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles
north of Los Angeles. The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in
the region, allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers
under the caldera.
   The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most
powerful eruptions, a blast that spewed 600 times more material
than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.
   Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' happened 550
years ago at the Inyo craters, which span Long Valley's north rim,
and 650 years ago at the Mono craters, several miles north of the
caldera.
   Despite the current activity, the probability of a major
earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is ``less than 1
percent each year,'' said David Hill, the U.S. Geological Survey
geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley.
   Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates ``a
scientific guessing game,'' and said area residents rarely discuss
the latest swarm of earthquakes, which started in May 1989.
   That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety, denial
and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the
Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984.
   During that period, subterranean molten rock pushed upward,
lifting the caldera's floor. As a result, the Geological Survey
issued a ``notice of potential volcanic hazard'' for Long Valley in
May 1982.
   That warning, coupled with jarring earthquakes, damaged tourism
and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market.
   ``The community overreacted,'' Murphy said. Residents accused
journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and
denounced scientists for scaring people.
   ``Initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get
funding from Congress,'' Alper said.
   The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered
Geological Survey changed its warning system and seismic activity
diminished, reducing the possibility of an eruption.
   Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and
continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, Lee Vining and other
Mono County resort towns. The temblors, most measuring 1 to 3 on
the Richter scale, started beneath Mammoth Mountain. In September
1989, they shifted to the caldera, where five to 10 small quakes
now happen daily.
   A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the
region last Tuesday, tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's
roads. It was eastern California's largest quake since 1984, but
wasn't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms,
Hill said.
   Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock
moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the
caldera, he said. The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979,
including 3 inches in the past year.
   While Long Valley ``is clearly an area that's showing unrest,
large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades
without necessarily erupting,'' Hill said.
   The floor of a caldera near Naples, Italy, rose 9 feet between
1970 and 1984 but didn't erupt. Comparable uplift inside a New
Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster.
   Nevertheless, Hill said, eastern Sierra residents are addressing
the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and
helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a
warning if an eruption appeared likely.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
hinted Saturday that the Iraqi leadership might be softening its
hard-line position in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   His remarks were interpreted as a sign that the Kremlin has made
progress in its diplomatic initiatives in the Persian Gulf. They
came a day before a Kremlin envoy was to meet with Saddam Hussein
in Baghdad.
   Gorbachev spoke at a news conference with Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez on the second day of a three-day visit, the first to Spain
by a Soviet head of state.
   He said there were indications there might be changes in the
hard-line position Iraq has taken since it invaded Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   ``In recent days, there have been signals from the Iraqi
leadership that ... solution of problems cannot be achieved through
ultimatums,'' Gorbachev said. ``I may be mistaken, and the coming
days might bring some clarification.''
   He did not elaborate on the Iraqi signals.
   A French TV station, however, reported Friday that Saddam had
sent letters to both French President Francois Mitterrand and
Gorbachev expressing his readiness to discuss Middle East problems,
including Kuwait.
   The station, La Cinq, quoted Saddam as saying he was open ``to
all ideas'' for resolving the gulf crisis. French officials denied
knowledge of any letters.
   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze reported
a change in Iraq's position to his Spanish counterpart, Francisco
Fernandez Ordonez. Shevardnadze said without elaborating that Iraq
is ``searching for some kind of dialogue,'' according to a Spanish
official.
   The emphasis on the crisis was expected to continue Sunday
evening when Gorbachev travels to Paris for a 24-hour visit that
include talks with Mitterrand. The trip coincides with Saddam's
promised release of the 327 French hostages from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Gorbachev discussed the crisis Saturday with Gonzalez, and the
two issued a joint political declaration calling Iraq's invasion
``flagrant violation of the norms of international law.''
   In the news conference, Gorbachev ruled out using military force
against Saddam. He cited the suffering such action would cause the
Iraqi people and the 3,000 Soviet specialists remaining in Iraq.
   ``Until the very end, we must take advantage of everything
within our reach to find a peaceful solution to this problem,''
Gorbachev said.
   His special envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, has met with Western and
Arab leaders on such a diplomatic mission. Primakov is to meet with
Saddam on Sunday.
   The Soviet Union and the United States, in their first major
cooperation on a regional conflict, are leading the anti-Iraq
coalition that has produced U.N. Security Council resolutions
slapping an economic embargo on Baghdad and permitting countries to
use their warships to enforce it.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev said Saddam may be trying to break up
that coalition. If so, the Soviet leader said, Saddam is suffering
from ``deep delusion.''
   In Spain, Gorbachev is also seeking aid for the ailing Soviet
economy as it switches from a centrally planned system to a market
system.
   Gorbachev and Gonzalez signed an agreement under which Spain
will extend $1.5 billion worth of loans to the Soviets for purchase
of Spanish food and consumer goods, as well as equipment for the
Soviet food, textile, shoe and clothing industries.
   ``We need these credits and financial resources to make ... the
transition to a market less painful for the people,'' Gorbachev
told reporters.
   He said countres that help the Soviet Union get through the
transition will be rewarded in the future.

   About 1,000 demonstrators opposed to a
planned high-speed rail project blocked train tracks and two
highways Saturday, provoking fistfights with drivers and delaying
30 trains.
   It was the latest in a series of disruptive protests by
residents of the Provence region opposed to the extension of the
national high-speed rail network from Lyon to the Mediterranean.
   Train service on the main north-south line through Avignon was
interrupted for nearly three hours, officials of the national
railroad said. They said 30 trains, carrying roughly 12,000 people
at the start of a major holiday week, were affected.
   Some of the protesters moved from the tracks to block two nearby
highways for about an hour, officials said. Detours were arranged
to alleviate traffic jams, but a three-mile backup was reported on
one of the roads.
   Leaders of the protest movement say the proposed high-speed
route will harm the environment and was selected before local
communities were consulted.

seventh game of the world chess championship Saturday to challenger
Anatoly Karpov, leaving the pair deadlocked in their $3 million
showdown.
   Kasparov - acknowledged by chess experts to be at a disadvantage
in the game at the point it broke off for the night Friday - opted
to resign rather than resume play, said Phyllis Arnold, spokeswoman
for the championship.
   The championship is now tied at 3{-3{. A player gets one point
for a victory, and each player gets a half point for a tie. Each
player has now won once, with the other five games ending in draws.
   The first player to reach 12{ points wins the championship.
Kasparov, who dethroned Karpov in 1985, would retain his title if
the match ended in a 12-12 tie.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the
remainder will be played in Lyons, France. The winner will get $1.7
million and the loser will get $1.3 million.
   The seventh game was adjourned Friday night when Karpov wrote
down his 44th move and sealed it in an envelope. If Kasparov had
not conceded defeat, play would have resumed Saturday evening.
   Karpov appeared to have a significant advantage over Kasparov
when the game adjourned because he had an extra pawn and was
thought to be in a superior position on the board.

<HEAD>Andrews Air Force Base Searches For Missing Stick Of Dynamite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security police at Andrews Air Force Base on
Saturday were still looking for a stick of dynamite unknowingly
driven off into the Maryland countryside during an anti-explosives
training exercise.
   The dynamite, missing since Thursday evening, could easily be
mistaken for a road flare and ``is considered extremely
dangerous,'' said Sgt. Janice Firth, a spokeswoman at the home base
for the president's Air Force One jet.
   She said live dynamite had been planted randomly in vehicles
near a training site in an exercise for explosives-detecting dogs
Thursday.
   However, the canine corps was beaten to the stick by a former
member of the military, who, unaware the exercise was going on,
drove off with two sticks of dynamite hidden under the wheel well
of his Datsun pickup truck.
   The man, who was not identified, drove his truck throughout
Prince George's County in suburban Maryland before police finally
tracked him down Friday morning, Firth said.
   One stick that apparently fell off as the man was driving away
was found near the base gate, but the other is still missing, she
said.
   She said the 8-inch by }-inch cylinder contains {-pound of
explosives and ``could be detonated by a sudden jolt, jar or
drop.''
   Firth said the stick has an orange wrapping labelled ``ditching
dynamite.''
   The spokeswoman said the training area was closely supervised
and the question of how the man had been able to enter the area and
drive off with a dynamite-loaded vehicle were ``being addressed.''

<HEAD>Encephalitis, Satanism Worries Make Halloween Full of Tricks This
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As millions of children prepare their witches' cloaks and Bart
Simpson masks, the traditions of Halloween are under attack this
year by mosquitoes in Florida, ``prayer warriors'' in San Francisco
and Detroit officials weary of their city's annual arson spree.
   Some educators also are taking another look at Halloween
activities in the classroom, with a few Maryland schools urging
parents to steer their children toward playful costumes - not
gruesome ones.
   Attacks aside, millions of youngsters - and plenty of adults,
too - will still become vampires, witches or Bart the cartoon star
for a night of trick-or-treating and partying Wednesday. They'll be
carrying on Halloweeen customs brought to the United States by
Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
   In Florida, however, the customs are being moved to broad
daylight this year. Because of an outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis, a disease spread by mosquitos that like to bite at
dusk, health officials have urged communities to hold Halloween
activities in the afternoon to reduce the risk of exposure.
   The city of St. Petersburg moved its evening Community Halloween
Festival to Sunday afternoon, as well as a traditional haunted
house, said Joel Garren, recreation division director.
   At Parrot Jungle in suburban Miami, 700 children and Big
Brother-Big Sister escorts turned out for a Halloween party
Saturday afternoon. ``The birds are very interested in it,'' said
Pat Callan, general manager of the tourist attraction. ``They
usually go higher on the perch because they're not sure what it is,
but I think they're catching on to Halloween.''
   In Kenneth City, a Gulf Coast city near Tampa, Mayor Alfred
Wells canceled the city's annual Firemen's Halloween Party, usually
attended by 600 children. ``I don't think it will be fair to bring
any kids out at all,'' he said.
   But Broward County officials in southern Florida decided to go
ahead with their plans, including nighttime haunted trails through
parks, said Bob Harbin, assistant director of parks and recreation.
There'll be mosquito repellent handy for those who need it.
   A Dallas televangelist is enlisting ``prayer warriors'' for a
Halloween attack on what he calls the satanic forces of witchcraft,
drugs and perversion in San Francisco.
   ``We need to reverse the curse on Halloween night,'' Larry Lea
said when he announced his campaign. His daily ``Change Your Life''
television show is seen on 40 independent stations. ``This is not
just kids having fun. There is actual worship of the devil.''
   In medieval times, the souls of the dead were thought to return
to their homes on the eve of All Saints' Day - or Halloween.
   Organizers of San Francico's bawdy Exotic Erotic Halloween Ball
invited Lea to attend the event set for Sunday night. The ball
draws hundreds of revelers who attend in various stages of dress
and undress.
   ``We're offended by Lea's impugning San Francisco and the Bay
area with all these accusations of evil,'' said Perry Mann, a
producer of the ball.
   Several educators in Maryland have sought to dissuade youngsters
from wearing anything devilish or gruesome to school.
   ``We try to encourage the kids to wear fun things instead of
things that can be frightful and detrimental,'' Beverly L. Norwood,
principal of Dundalk Elementary School in suburban Baltimore told
The (Baltimore) Sun.
   But 10-year-old Erica Schwartz is dressing up as a vampire and
doesn't think anyone should be worried about that.
   ``Halloween is about scary stuff,'' said Erica, a fifth-grader
at Mount Washington Elementary School in Baltimore. ``It's not
real.''
   Children in Newtown, Conn., were dispirited after a mock seance
to contact the ghost of Newtown's greatest benefactor was canceled
after a protest by residents and clergy.
   Sylvia Vuillemenot, the children's librarian at the Cyrenius H.
Booth Library, planned to dress up as Mary Hawley and materialize
in front of middle-school students Friday night.
   ``It was supposed to be a history lesson,'' said librarian Janet
Woycik. ``There's nothing in town for the middle-school kids to
do.''
   A few cities are trying to fight reputations for rowdy or fiery
Halloween celebrations. Detroit is shifting the focus of its
campaign against arson sprees that hit the city on the night before
Halloween.
   ``No more Devil's Night,'' was the slogan of last year's effort;
this year the campaign is dubbed ``My Heart is with Detroit.''
   ``We're attempting to come up with a more positive image for the
city,'' said Mayor Coleman Young. ``It's obvious that Devil's Night
has a bad connotation.''
   Devil's Night violence first erupted in Detroit in the late
1970s when residents began burning trash bins, abandoned houses and
garages. The fires peaked in 1984, with 810 reported during a
three-day period. Last year, city officials reported 223 fires but
the Detroit Fire Fighters Association counted almost twice as many.

   It's not your typical topic for a
roadside sign: The arrival of about 200 ancient language teachers
is being heralded by billboards advertising their favorite subject.
   ``Want Help in English? Want Better SAT Scores? Want a Larger
Vocabulary? The Basic Language - Take Latin!'' the billboards say.
   Lamar Outdoor Advertising donated the signs for a conference of

   A jury ordered a millionaire to pay his estranged
younger brother $1.2 million for describing him to a prospective
client as an extortionist who wasn't above fraud.
   The Dade County Circuit Court jury ruled Friday that Jorge Mas
Canosa maliciously libeled his brother, Ricardo Mas. Mas Canosa is
head of the Cuban American National Foundation, a lobby group.
   The jury reached its decision after deliberating almost three
hours. It based its decision on two letters Mas Canosa, 51, wrote
to Southern Bell, the younger man's prospective client.
   He reportedly wrote the letters because he was angry that his
brother quit a job with his construction business to establish a
competing company.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' Mas said. ``I wasn't expecting that amount
but I think it's a great decision.''
   Mas, 40, said he spent $100,000 in legal fees pursuing the
3-year-old lawsuit against his brother.
   The jury decided Mas Canosa, who had a net worth of $9.1 million
as of August 1989, should pay his brother's company $300,000 in
compensation and $900,000 in punitive damages.
   Jury foreman Kenneth Santerre told reporters the jury felt Mas
Canosa had no right to use his position as his brother's former
employer to try to hurt the younger man.
   ``It tore my family apart,'' Mas said. ``Now I feel I've been
exonerated.''
   Neither Mas Canosa nor his attorneys would speak to reporters
after the decision.
   Mas had accused his brother of libel and of depriving him of
contracting work at Southern Bell.
   Mas had worked for his brother's company, Church and Tower, a
principal construction contractor fr the phone company, until they
quarreled five years ago.
   Judge George Orr threw out the allegation of deprivation of work
since Southern Bell executives had hired Ricardo Mas even after
they received the letters.

   The 11 children of a woman killed by a
streetcar filed wrongful death claims against transit officials,
who announced a beefed-up saftey campaign for the newly opened rail
line.
   Rosa Ceballos, 56, died when she was hit by a Blue Line train
last month as she crossed the tracks on her way to church.
   Donald H. Cohen, an attorney representing Ceballos' children,
said Friday they had filed claims for $2 million each against the
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, the Southern
California Rapid Transit District and the state.
   Cohen said the plaintiffs, who range in age from 21 to 43, want
to raise public awareness about the danger the trains pose.
   Two people were killed and four others were injured in accidents
between Blue Line trains and cars last week.
   The 22-mile rail line that stretches between downtown Los
Angeles and Long Beach opened this summer.
   The transportation commission announced new safety measures
Friday.
   The measures include volunteer crossing guards, ``cyclops''
lights on trains to illuminate the tracks, and a review of existing
crossing gates and warning systems along the
   ``This is not to say that we've done anything unsafe, this is to
see what we can do as the designer to improve our safety
measures,'' said commission vice president Norman Jester.
   ``We have more bells and whistles than anyone. The problem has
been public education. We've got people driving around down
crossing gates, thinking they can beat the train through an
intersection,'' he said.

   Just a handful of votes, President Bush said
almost wistfully, and Republicans could control the Senate.
   But it would take a full hand, five seats, to wrest it from the
Democrats. And that target is almost certainly beyond GOP reach in
off-year elections that Republicans hoped would be at minimum a
stepping stone for 1992.
   That is the more likely year for a congressional shakeup,
despite this election season's voter wrath at a stumbling
government and worsening economy. The performance has hurt Bush's
standing, but he's still not as unpopular as Congress in the public
opinion polls.
   For a 1992 game plan to hold up, the Republicans need to add at
least a seat or two to their 45 in the Senate this year - and
there's at least as good a chance that they will lose seats
instead.
   At this point, strategists in both parties expect little net
change in the party lineups in Congress. A political aide to Bush
hedges the bet y saying that the White House hopes to defy history
and beat the pattern in which a president's party loses House and
Senate seats in off-year congressional elections.
   Counting that way, the administration can claim to have won
while losing.
   Limited losses in the House won't make a lot of difference,
given the lopsided majority the Democrats hold there. Both sides
anticipate Democratic gains in the House, probably in the range of
a half-dozen seats. The White House party has not gained House
seats in any off-year elections since the Democrats did it in 1934.
   But in the Senate, an off-year GOP loss in line with the
historic pattern of three seats would cripple Republican chances of
converting their minority into a majority and thus gaining a piece
of the action at the Capitol during the Bush presidency.
   The lineup is now 55 Democrats, 45 Republicans, five seats short
of the tie that would enable Vice President Dan Quayle to vote the
GOP into control.
   Despite the improbability of it, Quayle said ``maybe we'll be
lucky enough to pick up five seats and then it would be a 50-50
tie.''
   ``It would be my sheer delight to preside over a divided Senate
and to cast tie-breaking vote after tie-breaking vote for the
programs of President George Bush,'' he added during a campaign
stop Thursday in Runnemeade, N.J.
   Bush brought the subject up later Thursday surrounded by the
Congressional Republican leadership in the Rose Garden. ``If we had
more Republicans like everyone who is standing here, we wouldn't be
in this fiscal mess.''
   Republicans held Senate majorities for six of Ronald Reagan's
eight years in the White House, gaining control with a surprise,
dozen-seat gain when he was elected in 1980, losing it in 1986,
when Democrats picked up eight seats in off-year balloting.
   This time, position is a more realistic Republican goal than
control. The Nov. 6 competition is for 18 Senate seats now held by
Republicans, 16 held by Democrats. GOP strategists said they were
out to establish a foundation for gains into the 1990s. Eight GOP
House members left safe seats to bid for the Senate, five of them
against incumbent Democrats, the other three seeking to succeed
retiring Republicans.
   Bush was riding record-high voter approval ratings; while he had
no coattails in winning the White House, his popularity looked like
a major off-year asset.
   But according to the latest Gallup-Newsweek poll, Bush's
approval rate has slipped from 80 percent last January to 48
percent, the lowest rating of his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of
those polled thought he was losing political influence. And
Democrats who had seemed vulnerable early in the year turned out to
be tough at the end.
   In 1992, the Democrats will have 20 Senate seats to defend,
Republicans 14. Eleven of the Democrats are freshman senators, and
will be up for re-election for the first time. There are likely to
be retirements among senior Democrats, some with problems like Sen.
Alan Cranston's savings and loan involvement.
   But those promising circumstances won't make much difference
unless Republicans gain where history says they'll slip. Even then,
the 1992 strategy assumes a strong Bush ticket, with coattails that
were lacking in the 1988 elections.
   While he was winning the White House, the Democrats were gaining
a seat in the Senate. They haven't sustained a net loss there in
any election since 1980.

   A pit bull mauled a 4-year-old boy after the
child's parents agreed to keep the dog at their rural home for a
man who hadn't bought the insurance required to keep it in the
village.
   Joseph Lee Haddock was released from a hospital Friday after
surgery for facial lacerations, a spokeswoman said.
   The pit bull had been chained to a post when it attacked the boy
Thursday.
   Officials in this southern Illinois village of about 550 passed
an ordinance in September requiring owners of pit bulls to keep the
dogs caged or muzzled and to carry a $50,000 liability insurance
policy.
   The dog's owner, David McHarry, moved the dog to the home of his
friends, the Haddocks, to avoid violating the ordinance, Village
Clerk Ken Ledbetter said.
   McHarry said he was uncertain whether he could afford the
insurance or could cage the dog as securely as the ordinance
required.
   McHarry, upset over the attack, said he had planned to give the
dog away. He said it would be put to sleep.
   ``I'm sorry it happened,'' he said. ``It tears me up.''

   The shooting of an opposition
politician on the eve of the first multiparty elections in Soviet
Georgia has created an atmosphere of fear and acrimony in this
republic.
   Gia Chanturia, leader of the National Democratic Party, said he
was shot Friday afternoon as he left a meeting of politicians who
are boycotting Sunday's elections.
   ``I was saved by a miracle,'' said Chanturia, showing a reporter
and photographer his left arm, wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage.
   Chanturia accused the powerful leader of the Round Table
non-Communist opposition, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, of ordering the
shooting on instructions from Communist Party bosses.
   ``I don't know exactly who shot me, but I know who could have
done it,'' he said, referring to Gamsakhurdia. He said he believed
he was shot ``because someone wants to start a civil war,'' but did
not elaborate.
   Gamsakhurdia denied he was responsible for the shooting.
   ``This is a provocation, an attempt to sabotage the election,''
he said Saturday. ``It`s done by those parties and forces who don't
want these elections to be held.''
   His coalition and the Communist Party are leading contenders to
win a plurality in Sunday's election for the 250-seat Georgian
Supreme Soviet legislature. The plethora of parties makes it
unlikely a single group will win a majority.
   Chanturia is among Georgian opposition leaders who are
boycotting the vote. They were elected to the National Congress
earlier this month intending to form a shadow government to
pressure faster change in the republic.
   All parties participating in Sunday's election, including the
Communist Party, say Georgia should leave the Soviet Union.
   The political debate is over the duration of the ``transition''
period o national independence, and the degree of economic and
political cooperation the republic should maintain with the Soviet
Union.
   Georgia's desire for independence became almost a foregone
conclusion after April 9, 1989, when Soviet soldiers killed 19
people in a pre-dawn attack on a pro-independence demonstration in
downtown Tbilisi.
   On Saturday, candidates stood atop a bus using bullhorns to
address crowds on Independence Square - formerly named Lenin
Square.
   Even the Communist Party has tailored its rhetoric for the
pro-independence mood.
   ``The position of the Communist Party of Georgia is that all the
republics should be free,'' said Vazha Gurgenedze, the Communist
Party's secretary for ideology.
   Gurgenedze, himself a candidate, said that even a
Communist-dominated legislature would declare independence, allow
the free sale of private land and conclude economic agreements with
the other 14 Soviet republics.
   Gurgenedze acknowledges his platform might be more radical than
that of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wants all 15 republics
to sign a new treaty of union and remain in the Soviet fold.
   ``We think the Communist Party will receive a mandate, 40 to 60
percent of the vote. I can't really predict,'' he said.
   Gamsakhurdia predicted that his Round Table coalition would get
up to 70 percent of the vote if the elections were fair. He
dismissed a poll released last week showing the Communist Party
winning 32 percent of the vote, Round Table 21.5 and the rest of
ballots divided among other smaller parties.
   ``I know the man who prepared this poll, and he is a KGB
agent,'' Gamsakhurdia said Saturday. ``The Communists are preparing
a falsification.''
   ``We are receiving signals that they are violating the election
law, they are calling people and frightening them into voting
Communist, and the Communists are preparing too many ballots,'' he
said, raising the possibility that some will be improperly
completed.
   Gamsakhurdia was cheered at an evening rally when he accused
Communist Party authorities of failing to tell Georgia's 3 million
eligible voters where polls would be located Sunday.
   Gurgenedze, the Communist Party secretary, said the elections
would be fair. ``It's new for us. In previous elections, everything
was decided beforehand,'' he said.
   An American professor specializing in Georgian politics, Victor
Peppard of the University of South Florida and Tampa, said the vote
marked a milestone in Soviet politics because for the first time,
there is an independent election commission.
   ``Also, for the first time, there are independent parties,'' he
said. The formation of new political organizations became possible
this year after the Communist Party agreed to give up its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly.
   ``Here the opposition already has power, largely based on
Gamsakhurdia and his ability to call strikes, rally thousands of
people in the streets and shut down rail lines,'' Peppard said.

   Tourists out strolling on balmy Waikiki Beach
just after dawn Saturday morning were surprised to see that among
the swimmers was President Bush.
   Bush, accompanied by security agents, went for a dip in the
waters behind the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort hotel, where his
entourage was staying for a two-day political and diplomatic visit
to Honolulu.
   CNN cameraman Dan O'Shea, with the travelling press corps, said
he was out for a swim himself when someone floated by. ``I looked
over and it was him,'' said O'Shea, who promptly leaped out of the
water and ran to get his camera.
   Along with UPI photographer Joe Marquette, he waded back in, and
Bush did not dissuade them from moving in close to record his swim
just off the shore.
   Several dozen tourists, along with press photographers and
reporters, gathered on the beach by the time Bush emerged in a
dripping T-shirt and baggy shorts.
   Bush's Secret Service agents, some caught by surprise by his
sudden Pacific plunge, sweated in their suits and ties as they
urged onlookers to move back up the beach to the coconut trees.
   Bush appeared in good spirits after news from Washington that a
budget agreement had finally passed the House.
   ``I'm very pleased it passed the House,'' Bush said. When asked
if he was glad the long, laborious budget talks were over, he said,
``That's for sure.''
   As he crossed the beach, with the throng of onlookers in tow,
Bush told them the water was fine.

   The Kremlin ordered troops to Moldavia Saturday to
try to prevent ethnic violence between Moldavian youths and a
Turkish Christian minority demanding independence, Tass reported.
   Negotiations continued Saturday with the republic's Gagauz
minority, but no progress was reported, the official news agency
said.
   A day earlier, the republic declared a state of emergency in
part of southern Moldavia.
   The situation is ``highly tense and fraught with unpredictable
consequences,'' the national government said in a statement
reported by Tass. It said it was sending troops in to ``increase
security'' in the republic.
   The Kremlin also said the troops were going in at the request of
the Moldavian government and representatives of the Gagauz people.
It did not say how many troops were sent.
   The Gagauz, descendants of 19th century Turkish immigrants, have
declared sovereignty from Moldavia - which is itself trying to
break free of the Soviet Union.
   The unrest was the latest to flare in the Soviet Union's ethnic
and nationalist conflicts.
   It could further complicate President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
effort to hold the country together with a new union treaty and win
the republics' support for his plan to create a market economy.
   Tass said volunteer brigades of Moldavians, some armed with
sticks and metal rods, were defying the state of emergency and
jamming roads leading to the southern Moldavian districts of Komrat
and Chadyr-Lunga.
   Similar groups also were reported on the streets of the capital,
which also sent police to the disputed areas.
   Earlier reports said some weapons and explosives had been
confiscated from Gagauz separatists. No violence was reported.
   Tass said phone lines to the region were cut.
   A Tass correspondent in the Moldavian capital of Kishinev,
Alexander Tanas, said by telephone Saturday evening that a band of
ethnic Russians from Kishinev also had set out for the area.
   They were hoping to help defend the Gagauz against Moldavians,
but were stopped by authorities and ``persuaded'' to turn back, he
said.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Friday that the
republic was ``on the brink of civil war.''
   Moldavian officials said earlier that the state of emergency
would be enforced by Interior Ministry troops under their control.
The Kremlin's order Saturday for additional troops indicated more
help was needed.
   The Moldavian legislature imposed the two-month state of
emergency Friday after buses carrying thousands of Moldavians set
out to try to block voting by the Gagauz for a new, autonomous
government.
   Gagauz officials said later Friday they were prepared to
postpone the election in order to avert conflicts. It was not clear
whether they were held.
   The state of emergency restricts movement in and out of the area
and bans rallies. The Moldavian parliament also voted to abolish
local government bodies in the region and replace them with
committees appointed by the republic.
   About 150,000 Gagauz live in the southern corner of Moldavia, a
largely agricultural republic between the Ukraine and Romania. They
make up about 3 percent of the republic's 4.3 million people and
claim 11 percent of its territory.
   The Gagauz speak a Turkic language and traditionally work as
shepherds and farmers. They have complained of discrimination by
the Moldavian majority, objecting in particular to a law making
Moldavian the republic's official language.
   In neighboring Romania, meanwhile, hundreds of people
demonstrated in Bucharest Saturday for reunification with Moldavia,
which was annexed by the Soviets during World War II.
   Flag-waving demonstrators, including some opposition party
leaders, marched up the capital's main boulevard shouting
nationalistic slogans. They carried banners and wore badges that
read ``Bessarabia and Romania - one beating heart.'' Moldavia is
known to the Romanians as Bessarabia.
   Moldavia is the latest of several Soviet republics to face
separatist movements and ethnic conflicts, which threaten to
splinter the country and derail Gorbachev's reforms.
   Ethnic violence previously has broken out in Armenia, Georgia,
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Interior Ministry troops also were sent
to those areas after the violence.
   All but one of the 15 Soviet republics have declared some form
of autonomy from Moscow. The only holdout is Kirgizia, a Central
Asian republic, and its legislature is expected to declare
sovereignty soon.

   Leftist demonstrators Saturday clashed
with neo-Nazis shouting ``Heil Hitler!'' a news agency said. One of
the policemen called to the scene reportedly wounded two rioters.
   A policemen was also injured by rioters hurling stones, and
three teen-agers were arrested, the Germany news agency ADN said.
   It said the officer who wounded the rioters fired in
self-defense when confronted by attackers carrying iron bars,
sticks and signal flares. It did not say if the two people wounded
were neo-Nazi marchers or their opponents.
   The clashes began after nearly 150 neo-Nazi youths left a
discotheque in Leipzig, about 100 miles southwest of Berlin, and
marched through the city shouting Nazi salutes and slogans hostile
to foreigners, ADN said. The group was confronted by anti-Nazi
youths.
   Police separated the two groups, but one patrol car came under
attack by a group of between 30 to 50 youths, ADN said. One
policeman ``was forced to make use of his firearm,'' it said.
   Groups of neo-Nazis have made a growing number of appearances in
what used to be East Germany. Last weekend, about 350 neo-Nazis
marched through Dresden, about 120 miles south of Berlin, shouting
slogans against foreigners.

<HEAD>Klan Loses Appeal on Permit To March Along Constitution Avenue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia will not have to
allow the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to march along a
major Washington thoroughfare during a rally here Sunday, a federal
appeals court ruled Saturday.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia vacated an order by a lower court judge that
would have allowed the Klan to march along Constitution Avenue from
the Washington Monument grounds to the U.S. Capitol, said Mark
Langer, an aide to the court's clerk.
   Police had said the Klan could march along only four blocks of
the avenue.
   U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer earlier this week had
ruled in favor of a suit brought by the American Civil Liberties
Union, which claimed the Klan's constitutional rights were being
violated by the police limits.
   D.C. officials refused to issue the Klan a permit to march along
Constitution Avenue, saying they could not adequately insure the
safety of the marchers over such a long route. Police urged the
organization to instead travel from the monument grounds to the
Capitol mostly along the grassy Mall.
   ACLU legal director Arthur Spitzer said he would not comment on
the appeals court order. He said no decision had been made on
whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The last time the Klan attempted to march in Washington was on
the Labor Day weekend when they were met by several hundred
counterprotestors who massed along the parade route.
   District Police had to escort 44 Klan members to the Capitol
grounds where they held their rally.
   The counterdemonstrators, All Peoples Congress, had vowed to try
to stop Sunday's march as well.
   Permits filed by the Klan with the National Park Service and the
U.S. Capitol Police indicated that between 50 to 300 of its members
were expected to participate in Sunday's events.
   Officials of the Smithsonian museums said they would remain open
regular hours on Sunday, but the National Gallery of Art on the
east end of The Mall near the Capitol will be closed.
   D.C. Administrator Carol B. Thompson issued an appeal on
Saturday for the public to stay away from the Klan activities to
allow police and other authorities ``to do their jobs
effectively.''

their ban Sunday on entry by Palestinians from the occupied lands,
but they said there will be new security restrictions.
   More than 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip have been confined to the territories since Wednesday,
following a wave of Arab-Jewish street violence that left five
people dead and 11 injured.
   ``As of tommorrow, the Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria (the
West Bank) and the Gaza district will be permitted to re-enter the
state of Israel,'' the Defense Ministry said in a statement
Saturday.
   But it said, ``the right to enter Israel will be denied from
those taking part in hostile activities.'' It did not elaborate.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said Arabs might be locked out of
Israel again if violence persists.
   ``This is one of the means designed to bring about the cooling
of the tempers, an understanding among the Palestinian population
that repeated slayings will only worsen the Palestinian tragedy,''
he said.
   The previous restrictions prevented up to 150,000 Palestinian
laborers from going to their jobs in Israel, where they form much
of the blue-collar work force. It was not immediately clear how
many would be affected by the new restrictions.
   At present, several thousand Palestinians have been banned from
traveling to Israel for security or criminal offenses. They carry
special orange identity cards.
   Arens has also ordered the strengthening of supervision over
those going to work in Israel and new measures to ``prevent any
illegal stay in Israel,'' the ministry said.
   Thousands of Palestinian laborers employed in Israel have no
work permits. The majority of Palestinian workers, even those who
have the licenses, are required to return home for the night,
unless they have another permit allowing them to stay.
   But hundreds of them, notably in the Tel Aviv area, violate the
regulations to spend the night near their workplaces, staying at
rented apartments or in dormitories.
   Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said
Saturday the authorities ``will ask the employers, in a much more
serious manner, not to employ unlicensed workers, in order to
safeguard themselves and others. They, too, are responsible for
preventing terror attacks.''
   The absence of Palestinian workers since Wednesday has led to an
increase in work offers for Jews. Employment Service officials
reported 10,000 openings last week, six times more than normal.
   Arens' decision to lift the closure was immediately criticized
by some Israeli hard-liners, including members of his own Likud
bloc.
   ``This is a very high risk. I don't think it's right for a total
Israeli population to expose itself every day to more than 5,000
terrorists, murderers, who come under the perfectly legitimate
cover of employment,'' said Menachem Milson, the former military
governor of the occupied territories.
   Arens said no one could guarantee Israeli safety.
   ``It's not a new problem ... and to speak realistically, we will
face this problem in the future,'' he said on Israel Television.
   The current upsurge in the 34-month Palestinian uprising broke
out after the Oct. 8 shootings on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem,
when Israeli police killed 20 Palestinian rioters and wounded 140
others.
   An Israeli board of inquiry last week found that the police
fired in self-defense, but criticized commanders for failing to
anticipate the violence and accused police of firing
indiscriminately at one point.
   Israel expects an increase in cross-border guerrilla raids in
the wake of the Temple Mount shootings, Shomron said on Israel
radio.
   ``It is known that following the Temple Mount (events), there is
a greater motivation to act against Israel, to attack it from the
borders and not only within the territories or the green line,''
Shomron said, referring to Israel's pre-1967 borders. ``We have no
doubt that we can expect repeated (attack) attempts.''
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. These lands are the scene
of the Palestinian revolt, in which at least 766 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians.
   During the uprising, 289 Arabs have been slain by fellow
Palestinins as alleged pro-Israeli collaborators. Fifty-one
Israelis also have died.

<HEAD>Victims Of IRA Attacks Mourned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic bishop
denounced the IRA as followers of Satan during a eulogy Saturday at
the funeral of a man forced to drive a bomb into a military
checkpoint.
   ``They may say they are followers of Christ, some of them may
even still engage in the hypocrisy of coming to church, but their
lives and their works proclaim clearly that they follow Satan,''
said Bishop Edward Daly.
   Daly spoke at the funeral of Patsy Gillespie, 42, who was forced
to drive a van loaded with explosives into a military checkpoint
outside Londonderry. The explosion Wednesday morning killed
Gillespie and five British soldiers.
   Gillespie was a civilian kitchen assistant in the army's Fort
George camp in Londonderry. In its claim of responsibility for the
attack, the Irish Republican Army branded him a collaborator.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is seeking to drive the
British out of northern Ireland and unite it with the mainly
Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Gillespie's wife, Kathleen, said the family's home had been
taken over by armed men Tuesday night and her husband taken away
while the rest of the family was held hostage.
   The IRA used similar tactics in setting off a bomb the same
morning at a checkpoint in Newry. One soldier was killed. A third
attack in Omagh failed and the driver escaped injury.
   At the funeral Saturday of the soldier killed in Newry, the Rev.
Anthony Doran said 21-year-old Cyril Smith died because he had
helped the driver and then ran back to warn his comrades.
   Smith ``gave his life by running back into danger for his
friends,'' the Catholic priest said.
   Londonderry was a flash point of the ``troubles'' that erupted
in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, leading to a revival of the
IRA as the self-proclaimed defenders of the Catholic minority. The
city remains one of the IRA's strongholds.
   Daly, for years a stern critic of the IRA, said the outlawed
organization had ``descended a step lower to use people's lives to
launch their vile attacks.''
   ``Everyone is now at risk from these evil people with their foul
and obscene actions. They corrupt everything and every person they
touch,'' Daly said.
   ``We weep for the Gillespie family this morning. We weep for the
families of the soldiers who died and we weep for our own city, a
city we all love deeply.
   ``We weep because we have among our citizens men who are capable
of planning and carrying out and even attempting to justify such
evil.''
   Gillespie died on his oldest son's birthay. His wife and three
children -Patrick, 18, Kieran, 16, and Jennifer, 12 - wept at the
graveside.
   Among the 60 wreaths was one from the Kings Regiment, which lost
five soldiers in the attack.
   The death toll in Northern Ireland rose to 63 with the killing
Friday night of Tommy Casey, a member of the IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein. Protestant guerrillas were suspected in the
killing.

   Israel has had an ugly week.
   Street violence between Arabs and Jews left five dead and 11
injured. The government closed the pre-1967 borders in an attempt
to separate the Jews of Israel from the Arabs of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   For most Israelis, these are strange and unsettling times: Arabs
knifing Jews in public, Jews beating one of the assailants to
death, police rounding up Arabs and sending them home.
   More than 110,000 Arabs were cut off from their jobs in Israel
by the sealing of the ``green line,'' as Israelis call the borders
that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
   The border was to reopen Sunday, although the Defense Ministry
said additional measures would be taken to make sure Palestinians
planning violence did not get through. It said the border might be
closed again if violence persisted.
   The decision to seal the ``green line'' was not a simple one for
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government. The green line vanished
long ago from Israeli maps and road signs. According to Shamir's
nationalist doctrine of Greater Israel, it no longer exists.
   The roadblocks and long lines of sullen, protesting Arabs say
otherwise.
   ``The green line is firm and abiding,'' wrote Zeev Schiff,
respected military commentator for the newspaper Haaretz.
   ``It is as if a wall has gone up,'' said Nidal Abu Yehyah, a
fifth-generation Palestinian grocer in Jerusalem.
   Israeli authorities said the closure was a security measure of
no political significance.
   The closure's effect were felt immediately. Arabs lost wages and
Israel lost its blue-collar work force. Restaurants were short of
waiters, construction sites were idle, streets went unswept.
   The latest cycle of violence began Oct. 8, when Israeli police
fired into a stone-throwing Palestinian crowd on the Temple Mount,
known to Arabs as Haram es-Sharif. Government investigators said 20
Palestinians were killed.
   It provoked a spate of Arab attacks, beginning with a
Palestinian who stabbed three Israelis to death in a rampage
through a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem last Sunday. According
to police, the attacker said he was taking revenge for the Temple
Mount killings.
   More attacks followed: two unarmed women soldiers knifed at a
crossroad in northern Israel; two Israelis hit on the head with an
11-pound hammer by their Arab employee in a workshop.
   The soldiers' attacker died of brain injuries inflicted by
civilians who caught him. That night, shots fired at a car near the
Gaza Strip killed an Arab occupant.
   Tel Aviv police reported 1,700 calls from Jews informing on
Arabs who disregarded orders to leave Israel. The owner of a large
office block in Jerusalem said Jewish tenants want him to fire his
Arab cleaners and car park attendants.
   At the United Nations, the Security Council voted a second
condemnation of Israel over the Temple Mount killings, this time
for refusing to let it investigate.
   Israel's own commission of inquiry largely supported the
government version of events. It said police were being stoned by
rioters and fired to defend theselves and the Jews worshiping at
the adjacent Western Wall.
   Arabs dismissed the report as a whitewash.
   The knife attacks, incited by Moslem fundamentalist leaflets
urging the killing of Jews, have spread fear that the 34-month old
Palestinian uprising has entered an ominous new phase.
   Yossi Sarid, a dovish member of Parliament, accused Shamir of
paralyzing the peace process, and said: ``If there is no movement .
. . the blood that is spilled will be on his head.''
   Speaking on Israel television, Sarid added a warning to
Palestinians: ``What is happening now, knifemanship instead of
statesmanship, is cutting the ground from under their feet.
   ``Soon, there will be no moderates in Israel. If people go out
of their minds worrying about a child who hasn't come home, if the
fear reaches our doorsteps, there will be no more moderates.''
   Jewish and Arab doves have welcomed the closure of the green
line. They see it as a step toward weaning the Arabs away from
economic dependence on Israel and building a Palestinian state.
   They agree with Amos Oz, a leading Israeli novelist and peace
activist, who wrote Friday in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth:
``Anyone who chooses life over death has to understand that these
two nations urgently need to separate.''
   For Zionist idealists who believe the Jewish state should run on
Jewish labor, the border closure is well timed.
   Unemployment is increasing rising, worsened by thousands of
job-seeking Soviet Jewish immigrants. What could be more sensible,
they ask, than giving these Jews the Arabs' jobs?
   Sarid feels Israel has an opportunity to foster a homegrown
Palestinian economy that will set the 1.7 million Arabs of the West
Bank and Gaza on the road to statehood.
   Dr. Adel Samara, a West Bank economist, agrees. He says
Palestinians have been demanding independence for 23 years without
laying the groundwork for it.
   ``I could see in the new ban on workers a positive chance for us
to use our economic resources and face a new situation without the
workers' income from Israel,'' he said in an interview.
   Zvi Elpeleg, former military governor of the West Bank, believes
there already is a de facto Palestinian administration, run by
leaders of the uprising.
   This leadership decides when shops will open, which Palestinian
police can continue serving the Israeli government, on what days
Palestinians can sell their produce in Israel, he said, adding:
   ``There are wide areas in which the Israeli government is no
longer relevant.''

<HEAD>Organized Crime Figures Indicted on Bingo Money-Laundering Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six reputed organized crime figures from Miami,
Chicago and New York were indicted on charges of laundering illegal
profits through a commercial bingo parlor and conspiring to torch a
competing bingo hall.
   Prosecutors said the six supplied convicted gambler Stephen
Paskind, who owns Bingo World, with more than $1 million to launder
from Illinois and Florida.
   Paskind was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the
14-count indictment unsealed Friday.
   The laundered money came from loan-sharking, gambling, robbery
and interstate transportation of stolen property, the indictment
alleges.
   ``We consider this a very significant case considering the
people involved,'' said Greg Bernstein, assistant U.S. attorney.
``Bingo halls for profit are a very easy place to launder money.''
   Indicted were Dominic Peter ``Large'' Cortina, 65, of Chicago;
Donald John Angelini, 70, of Elmhurst, Ill.; Sam Frank Urbana, 65,
and Izaak Martin ``Red'' Silber, 78, both of Miami; Angelo ``Gus''
King, 64, of West Hollywood, Fla.; and Ettore ``Eddie'' Coco, 82,
of New York.
   Prosecutors would not say why Paskind was not indicted, but
Florida law enforcement officials have testified he was an
informant on organized crime there.
   Bernstein said Urbana and Cortina were indicted in Florida last
year on federal racketeering charges.
   Cortina, a convicted gambling kingpin, was believed by
authorities to be an organized crime leader in Chicago. Angelini, a
close associate of Cortina, is serving a federal prison sentence on
a gambling charge. Coco is reputed to be a semi-retired leader of
the Lucchese crime family in New York.
   All six were indicted on charges that include conspiracy, hiding
income from the Department of the Treasury, money laundering and
interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
   Federal prosecutors allege that Paskind approached Cortina,
Angelini and Urbana in 1986 as financial backers in the
construction and operation of Bingo World. Urbana and a Miami man
traveled to New York to obtain Coco's ``approval to operate Bingo
World in the state of Maryland,'' offering him a share of the
profits in return, the indictment alleges.
   In the arson conspiracy case, Paskind, King and Angelini
allegedly met in 1988 with two other men to discuss Bingo World's
competitor, Bingo Palace. Paskind allegedly met with King in
Florida in September 1989 to ``discuss the arson at Bingo Palace.''
   Paskind allegedly paid $20,000 to an arsonist named ``Tommy'' to
set a fire at Bingo Palace on Oct. 5, 1989. A sprinkler system
halted the spread of the blaze, but damage was serious enough to
prevent the scheduled reopening of the business.
   The indictment outlines a series of transactions in which
illegal profits allegedly were funneled to Paskind by some of the
others and deposited into personal and Bingo World accounts in
Florida and Maryland in sums under $10,000.
   The intent was to thwart Internal Revenue Service requirements
that banks report cash transactions exceeding $10,000, authorities
said.
   Stephen Bronstein, a Maryland accountant who manages Bingo
World, said Friday its operators had no comment.
   Bingo World remains open, pending appeal of an Anne Arundel
County order shutting it down because of Paskind's alleged
association with organized crime figures.

   President Bush's approval rating has slipped to
48 percent, its lowest point during his presidency, in a poll
conducted for Newsweek by the Gallup Organization, the magazine
said Saturday.
   Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the way Bush is
handling his job, 48 percent approved, down from 57 percent in the
Newsweek poll Oct. 19. Those who disapproved totaled 36 percent and
those who didn't know made up 16 percent in the poll reported in
Newsweek's Nov. 5 issue.
   Asked about Bush's handling of U.S. economic conditions, 56
percent disapproved and 33 percent approved, Newsweek said.
   Only 19 percent said they trust Bush most to set the course for
the nation's economic policy. The other choices in the poll were
congressional Republicans (21 percent) and congressional Democrats
(36 percent).
   Newsweek said Gallup interviewed 753 American adults by
telephone Thursday and Friday in a sampling that generally should
have a margin of error no larger than 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Bishops Affirm Celibacy Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worldwide gathering of bishops, affirming
celibacy in the priesthood, on Saturday urged Pope John Paul II to
make it clear that the controversial rule won't be changed.
   The pope was quick to take up the invitation. He told the
bishops that although there is a shortage of priests in some parts
of the world, ordaining married men is not the solution.
   ``This isn't a solution to take under consideration and the
problem needs to be addressed by other means,'' such as help from
dioceses which have enough priests, the pontiff said.
   The Vatican requires celibacy for priests in Latin rite
churches. The church believes that forsaking marriage and sexual
relations means more time for priestly duties and less opportuity
for distractions.
   Exceptions have been made for men who converted to Roman
Catholicism after their marriage. In addition, some Eastern rite
Catholic churches permit married men to be priests, and that
practice was left intact in a recent revision of the rites' laws.
   The month-long assembly, or synod, was convened by the pope to
discuss problems in training priests in the Roman Catholic church,
which in recent years has seen several scandals involving sex and a
drop in vocations in developed countries, such as the United States
and in Western Europe.
   At least three bishops at the synod called for changes in the
celibacy rule, but Vatican officials said the requirement was not
up for debate.
   ``Some have asked ... to consider the ordination of `viri
probati,'' John Paul said, using a Latin term for `married,
spiritually mature'' men.
   He said media reports suggesting there might be a change in the
celibacy rule were misleading.
   ``The possibility of a recourse to the `viri probati' is too
often evoked in the context of propaganda systematically hostile to
priestly celibacy. Such propaganda finds support and complicity in
some mass media,'' the pope said.
   Some bishops echoed the pope's view.
   ``Some candidates (for the priesthood) think, via the mass
media, that there will be a change'' in the celibacy rule, said
Archbishop John Foley, a U.S. prelate who heads the Pontifical
Council on Social Communication.
   ``We have to be honest, to remove every doubt, not to give a
false impression,'' Foley said at a briefing for reporters
following the synod's last working session.
   In what was seen as an attempt to keep the issue alive during
the synod, a Brazilian cardinal revealed in an interview with an
Italian Catholic magazine, that in the 1980s Pope John Paul II had
approved the ordination of two married men in Brazil on condition
the men abstain from sexual relations with their wives and live in
separate households.
   Asked if the bishops' recommendation to the pope meant ``debate
was closed'' on celibacy, Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves said the
synod's affirmation ``was a very spontaneous expression'' of the
bishops' thinking.
   ``There was no lobby to reaffirm celibacy'' Neves said.
   The synod also suggested that young men considering the
priesthood spend a year of reflection - either before joining a
seminary or at some point during seminary studies - to explore
their desire to become a priest.
   ``A lot of young people live in confusion about their faith,''
said Archbishop Jan Schotte, secretary-general of the bishops'
synod. The extra time would ``let candidates learn what it is all
about.''
   Also recommended was better preparation of seminary instructors
and continued education for priests.
   The practice of holding synods, or advisory assemblies, on
specific subjects was taken up following the Second Vatican Council
of the early 1960s, which was marked by liturgial reforms and moves
toward better relations with other faiths.

<TEXT>
   The partisan makeup of the House for the next
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year. As
they choose governors and state legislators, these voters will be
picking the power brokers for major redistricting battles.
   The arcane redistricting process draws little attention from
voters. But national political parties are pouring millions of
dollars and advice into state legislative races that often are
ignored in Washington except in years ending in zero.
   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the Census Bureau
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute U.S. House seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 House seats are expected to shift as a result of the
1990 Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
Northeast and Midwest to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the White House from
the GOP.
   Republicans for most of the 1980s touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the House. But the GOP now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the GOP is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said Tim Dickson, executive director
of the Democratic Party's redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the House through the
year 2003; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said Ben Ginsberg, the Republican National
Committee's chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the 1980 Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the Census Bureau term
for deciding how many of the 435 House seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in Virginia, New Jersey,
Mississippi and Kentucky.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
California, Florida and Texas.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
Florida Senate appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the Texas and California
legislatures and in the Florida House.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the Florida Senate, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, New York, focuses on the state Senate, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the RNC's Ginsberg.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said Democratic
National Committee redistricting guru Mark Bohannon. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President Bush has visited New York to help the GOP's state
Senate effort, and Gov. Mario Cuomo is working hard for the
Democrats. New York likely will lose three of its 34 House seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Michigan.
They hope to capture the senates in Pennsylvania and Michigan and
both chambers in Indiana, where the GOP has two-seat majorities in
the House and Senate. With the Ohio gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the Ohio Senate, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim GOP majorities in both chambers of the
Arizona legislature and the Colorado House.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the Florida Senate
contests as well as in Illinois, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the Senate. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in Pennsylvania and Oregon, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are Massachusetts, New Jersey, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas and Montana. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by California, which should
gain seven seats and see its House delegation grow to 52. Florida's
expected gain of four would bring its House delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by Texas would swell its
representation in the House to 30.
   Together, these states would supply 24 percent of House members
and hold 105 Electoral College votes - 38 percent of the 270 needed
to win the White House.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Washington.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - Idaho,
Kansas, New Hampshire and South Dakota - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

   Author Elliott Roosevelt, who served
his father, President Franklin Roosevelt, during World War II and
later wrote a best seller about it, died Saturday in Scottsdale.
   He died of congestive heart failure at his home, said Patricia
Roosevelt, his wife of 30 years.
   Roosevelt, 80, was a World War II Air Corps general as well as
author and lecturer. He was also a former mayor of Miami Beach,
Fla., and a Democratic National Committeeman from that state.
   His business career included ventures in advertising, radio
station management and ranching.
   Roosevelt was born Sept. 23, 1910, in New York City. He attended
Groton and Hun preparatory schools as well as Columbia University.
   In World War II, Roosevelt commanded the multinational aerial
reconnaissance wing that played a key role in the Allies' 1944
D-Day landings in Normandy, France, as well as the invasions of
North Africa and Sicily.
   He flew 89 missions during, was wounded twice and was decorated
for valor by the United States, France, Morocco and England.
   Roosevelt launched his writing career in 1946 with the
publication of the best-selling book, ``As He Saw It,'' which
detailed his experiences as aide to his father at five historic
wartime summit conferences.
   He later wrote a trilogy of books about his parents and in 1983
wrote ``The Conservators,'' a statement of his philosophy about
survival of the planet.
   Roosevelt lived in the Phoenix area in the late 1950s and
returned to Arizona in 1989, settling in Scottsdale.
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a brother, James; eight
children; 21 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
   Memorial services will be held Tuesday in Scottsdale.

<HEAD>Iraqis Have Numerical Edge, But U.S.-Led Force Has Other
Advantages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly three months after the
conquest of Kuwait, Iraq's armies hold a large numerical edge over
the multinational force arrayed against it in the Saudi desert.
   But those numbers may start evening up soon. And even now,
commanders and analysts say they believe Saddam Hussein's forces
are inferior in terms of training, weapons - and possibly morale.
   Those could be key factors if war erupts.
   ``The Iraqi armed forces are large,'' Air Chief Marshal Sir
Patrick Hine said last week. ``On the other hand, we have many
advantages.''
   Hine is the joint commander of British forces in the region.
   ``We have total maritime supremacy and the allied air forces are
more capable overall than Saddam's. And then you've got the high
quality of American, British and other ground forces here. It's by
no means all in his favor,'' he said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last week that up to 100,000
U.S. troops could be added to the 220,000-member American force
deployed in the gulf region.
   U.S. troops make up the bulk of the multinational force of about
300,000 troops. They confront an estimated 430,000 Iraqis in Kuwait
and southern Iraq.
   In addition to a troop-strength edge, Iraq has an advantage in
terms of some weaponry.
   Iraq overwhelms the allied forces with 5,500 main battle tanks,
including about 1,000 high-quality, Soviet-designed T-72s. An
estimated 3,000 tanks are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq,
including all the T-72s.
   By the end of October, the United States will have deployed
about 700 M1 Abrams tanks to the region. It is also transferring
several hundred advanced M1A1 tanks with 120mm guns from storage in
Germany to replace some of the older M1s.
   Brtain has sent its 7th Armored Brigade, the ``Desert Rats,''
with more than 120 Challenger tanks and 45 Warrior armored fighting
vehicles.
   But the numbers alone don't tell the whole story, analysts say.
   ``You can't (only) compare equipment with equipment,'' said Don
Kerr, an analyst at London's International Institute for Strategic
Studies. Training, maintenance and morale are also key factors, he
said.
   If it came to battle, he said, ``the strategy would be to hold
the Iraqis static in position and let the aircraft and helicopters
go at the tanks.''
   There's little question that the allied air strength is superior
in quality, numbers and readiness.
   Saddam has 500-plus combat aircraft, including Soviet-supplied
long-range fighter-bombers and advanced MiG-29 interceptors, spread
around an estimated 25 airbases.
   Among the 700 tactical aircraft ranged against Iraq are 430 from
the U.S. Air Force, including 22 Stealth fighter-bombers and 38
long-range bombers.
   Also, the armada of Western warships in the region dwarfs Iraq's
small navy.
   As for Iraq's arsenal of missiles and chemical weapons, military
analysts have said they would appear to have limited military use
since the missiles have low accuracy and it is doubtful whether
Iraq actually has workable chemical warheads for its missiles.
   That leaves only chemical artillery shells and aerial bombing to
deliver the chemical weapons.
   If it comes to war, the Iraqis could have the advantage of a
relatively unified command system facing an allied force of units
from many nations.
   But Kerr said the U.S. Central Command headquarters could set
strategic objectives while giving a certain amount of tactical
flexibility to individual units from the various nations.
   In any combat that erupts, Iraqis would initially be defending
Kuwait, not their own soil. That could be a factor in undermining
morale and willingness to fight, he said.

<TEXT>
   Stephen W. Schneider, in a
letter-to-the-editor to The Dallas Morning News, suggests that
officeholders running for re-election should have ``Inc'' placed
after their names on the ballot.
   ``Inc'' would stand for ``incumbent,'' but if voters took it to
mean ``incompetent,'' well, that's ``an understandable
conclusion,'' writes Schneider sardonically.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., was home for the weekend taking
part in a parade at a Navajo Reservation when someone - he figures
it was a federal employee unhappy about the government's budget
impasse - called out, ``You're playing with our lives.''
   For the first time, Richardson said, he heard the most
dispiriting sound a politician can hear. He was booed.
   ``It's not comforting to be an elected official these days,''
said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   Americans seem to be growing more and more hostile toward
government - viewing it more as their enemy than their servant.
   The evidence is everywhere.
   Oklahomans, getting even, voted to bounce legislators out of
office - good, bad or indifferent - after they've served 12 years.
Similar term-limitation propositions are expected to get heavy
votes in California and Colorado on election day.
   On Oct. 6, the day President Bush shut down the government in a
budget impasse with Congress, former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke
got 44 percent of the vote in Louisiana against three-term
Democratic Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
   Duke got nearly 60 percent of the white vote, even though the
establishment of both political parties was against him. His
showing has been interpreted as a disgust-with-Washington vote.
   Congressional votes to raise Congress' pay last spring produced
an outburst of outrage.
   One poll found that 57 percent of the American people don't
believe the government represents people like them. Some observers
contend that suspicion of government can be healthy.
   Healthy or not, it's certainly not new.
   The founding fathers were suspicious of government and wrote a
cumbersome system of checks and balances and limited powers into
the Constitution. Individual presidents have been the targets of
national scorn, even assassins.
   But for all the alleged throw-the-rascals-out sentiment within
the body politic, for all of newspaper reader Stephen Schneider's
disgust with officeholders, most incumbents get re-elected. In
1988, 404 of 408 incumbents were returned to the House by the
voters.
   Bruce Buchanan, political scientist at the University of Texas,
said voter turnout is a better thermometer of the public mood. When
people are disenchanted with government, he said, they don't vote.
Turnout has been lower in the 20th century than it was in the 19th,
lower in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 1950s.
   ``Now only about half the electorate shows up,'' he said.
   So something sour is going on. Government that is supposed to be
for, of and by the people increasingly is looked upon as
impersonal, nosy, self-serving, bloated, wasteful, incompetent,
corrupt and unhelpful.
   After all, two presidents ran on that premise. Jimmy Carter
promised to change government: he would produce ``a government as
good as the people.'' Ronald Reagan would ``get the government off
your back.''
   Politicians, said Buchanan, have a responsibility to encourage
belief in the system. Running against government, he said, ``is
like eating the seed corn.''
   Buchanan breaks the disenchanted into these groups:
   -The Archie Bunker Types. These are the Louisianans who are not
racists but still voted for David Duke. ``They are fed up with a
government that seems interested in everyone except them. They
regard affirmative action programs as aimed against them.''
   -The Cynics. An even larger group, ``they regard government as
increasingly self-serving and irrelevant to them and their lives.''
   -The Turned-Off. They believe in government, but are appalled by
manipulative political campaigns that consist of content-less
advertising and preening. ``They listen to gubernatorial candidates
in Texas and California, and decide that what they are talking
about has nothing to do with what the one who wins will have to
do.''
   - The Indifferent Young. ``They're 18 to 24, and all of this is
utterly irrelevant to them. They don't care about politics. They
don't read the paper. They are ignorant of the process.''
   ``Put them all together,'' Buchanan said, ``and you have a big
group who don't vote, don't pay attention and who get mad.''
   John Gardner, former cabinet member and founder of Common Cause,
a citizen group that seeks to reform government, blames the mix of
money and politics. He thinks America is becoming aware of how
``campaign money is corrupting our political system.''
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., agrees. ``We've got too much money in
politics,'' he said. ``The individual voters feels his money or
vote doesn't count.''
   Willard Wirtz, secretary of labor in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, believes ``confidence in government has diminished
for almost 25 years now.''
   ``It probably started when people discovered they weren't being
told the truth about the Vietnam war,'' Wirtz said. ``It developed
with Watergate and the discovery that their president was a crook.
Then both Carter and Reagan seemed to have, in very different
forms, a contempt for the processes of government.''
   Constance Berry Newman, who as director of the Office of
Personnel Management is the chief personnel officer for the
government's 3 million civilian employees, has a few theories of
her own.
   For one thing, she said, people don't realize what they're
getting from the government for their taxes. People eat food that
has been tested by government, drive on government-built roads,
send their kids to government-operated schools without a second
thought, she said.
   Then, people blame government when they have a run-in with the
Social Security bureaucrat or the IRS.
   Second, she said, ``We are down to problems in this country that
can only be resolved by some group giving up something for another.
For a long time we solved problems by putting new money on the
table. It didn't have to be taken from someone else. We were
borrowing it, in fact.
   ``Now all the problems have to be resolved at the expense of
something else. That brings about resentment. People making those
tradeoffs become the enemy. They're policymakers and elected
officials. They're government.''

<HEAD>Union Warns Chrysler Corp. in Strike Letter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers is threatening Chrysler
Corp. with a strike at midnight Monday unless substantial progress
is made on a new contract, union and company officials said
Saturday.
   The warning, in a letter the union gave Chrysler on Friday, puts
the pressure on negotiations that began in mid-July, but UAW
spokesman Bob Barbee would not say if the letter increases the
likelihood of a strike.
   Chrysler is the only one of the Big Three automakers yet to
reach a new three-year agreement with the UAW, which represents
about 63,000 active Chrysler workers.
   The union wants to negotiate a contract with Chrysler similar to
those reached with General Motors Corp. in September and with Ford
Motor Co. earlier this month.
   Among the major issues between the UAW and Chrysler are
health-care and retiree benefits. The company said it may not be
able to afford provisions on health care and pensions that are in
the so-called pattern agreement with GM and Ford. The union is
using those contracts as models for the Chrysler contract.
   Chrysler was expected to announce Monday a third-quarter loss
likely to wipe out $251 million the company earned during the first
two quarters of this year.
   The union letter technically clears the way for a strike against
Chrysler, but also gives negotiators, who met Saturday, another
couple of days to work out a contract.
   The union could agree to extend the deadline on a day-to-day
basis, could strike or could continue working under an informal
extension agreement.
   Clarence Cobb, a member of UAW Local 7 in Detroit, said it was
time for a strike against Chrysler.
   ``The heat should have been turned up a long time ago,'' he
said. ``They should have stuck them a long time ago.''
   Local 7 represented workers at a Chrysler assembly plant that
the company shut down in ebruary. Cobb and more than 2,000 other
laid-off workers are waiting for Chrysler to complete construction
of a new plant so they can return to work.
   Until then, Cobb is living on $380 a week in unemployment
benefits and his wife's salary as a city court worker in Detroit.
   ``I'm living week-to-week. I'd be up a creek if my wife wasn't
working,'' said Cobb, who worked for Chrysler for 24 years before
being laid off.
   Negotiations continued in subcommittees, which focus on specific
areas of a contract. In addition, UAW President Owen Bieber and
Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John have met with key
negotiators occasionally over the past few days.
   After the UAW pattern agreement was ratified with GM workers, it
took just six days for Ford and the union to reach agreement. Talks
between the union and Chrysler are moving slower.
   The Canadian Auto Workers union and Chrysler Canada Ltd. reached
an agreement last week that mirrored a pattern contract the union
had negotiated with GM and Ford Canadian subsidiaries.

gusted to 60 mph.
   Sunny and dry weather prevailed across much of the nation.
Clouds were primarily confined to the northern tier states.
Northern Michigan got showers.
   Temperatures were as high as the 70s and 80s in the southern

<TEXT>
   An official of the former East German Communist
Party said Saturday that party chairman Gregor Gysi was kept in the
dark about illegal money transfers abroad, the ADN news agency
reported.
   Gysi, 42, offered to step down as the party's leadership met in
an emergency session to discuss the implications of the financial
scandal. But he withdrew the offer after the 95-member party board
gave him a unanimous vote of confidence.
   Two officials in East Germany's former Communist Party have been
arrested for allegedly funneling about $70 million in party funds
out of the country and into accounts in the Soviet Union.
   On Saturday, Karl-Heinz Kaufmann, a former Communist official
from the city of Halle, told ADN he transferred the $70 million to
accounts belonging to a Soviet company. But he said Gysi was not
aware of the action.
   In a speech to the party board, Gysi confirmed that he had been
unaware of the transfer. He said many party members had signed
appeals for him to remain as chairman.
   The scandal appeared likely to hurt the party's chances in
national elections for an all-German parliament on Dec. 2. It also
cast doubt on Gysi's political future.
   After last year's popular revolt which swept the Communists out
of power, the party purged most of its Old Guard, renamed itself
the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS, and elected Gysi as
chairman.
   But as successor to the Communists, the PDS has been viewed with
suspicion by the traditional German political parties.
   The party's deputy chairman and treasurer, Wolfgang Pohl, and
its financial director, Wolfgang Langnitschke, earlier admitted
funneling the money to accounts belonging to a Soviet company. They
were arrested Friday.
   A party statement said the two officials acted without the
knowledge or approval of the party leadership. Pohl said he was
trying to protect party funds from being seized by the government.
   Berlin police raided the party headquarters on Oct. 19, seeking
evidence on the illegal money transfers. The party said at the time
that money had been paid to the Soviets, but only to cover old
debts and pay for the living expenses of students it was sponsoring
in Moscow.
   However, Gysi went to Moscow on Thursday and was told that the
Soviet Communist Party did not request the funds.
   Kaufmann was quoted by ADN as saying that he and Pohl
transferred the money because of the ``imminent threat of
expropriation'' of party funds by the government.
   ``We wanted to keep Gysi and Modrow clean,'' Kaufmann was quoted
as saying. Hans Modrow was East Germany's last Communist premier
and guided the country until its first free elections in March.
   Both Gysi and Modrow are among the 24 PDS deputies who hold
temporary seats in German Parliament.
   When the two Germanys united on Oct. 3., 144 former East German
lawmakers were given seats in the parliament until the December
elections.
   ADN said it spoke to Kaufmann on Saturday in Moscow, where he
had been staying for the past few days ``in connection with the
multimillion-deal.''
   According to ADN, Kaufmann told the agency he transferred the
money to the Berlin accounts of the Soviet company Putnik, from
where the money was moved to Putnik's accounts in other countries,
among them the Netherlands.
   Putnik also gave PDS false receipts that claimed the money went
into construction work and student fees, ADN quoted Kaufmann as
saying.
   Kaufmann told ADN his own company in Halle, Putnik, and two
other German firms had been planning to use the money to start a
trading company. Kaufmann claimed that two Dutch banks also had
been involved in the project. The banks were not identified in the
ADN report.
   ``We wanted to create jobs for many old comrades who are now
unemployed,'' Kaufmann was quoted as saying.
   But German television said Putnik was a front company.
   Kaufmann told ADN he does not feel he has done anything illegal.
   Late Friday, Berlin police again searched PDS headquarters in an
attempt to determine if there was evidence of more financial
iregularities. Party spokesman Hanno Harnisch said police took away
several hundred pounds of documents.

<TEXT>
   The commander of the USS Iwo Jima said
Saturday that Marines aboard his ship have completed drills for a
landing operation in case of a military showdown to drive Iraq from
Kuwait.
   ``We are at a very high state and level of readiness,'' Capt.
Michael S. O'Hearn told reporters aboard his ship, calling in
Bahrain to allow its 1,700 Marines a break after the exercise.
   The IwoJima is one of 18 amphibious assault vessels deployed to
the multinational air, sea and naval buildup that followed Saddam
Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Thirty-seven other U.S. Navy units are in the Persian Gulf, the
Arabian Sea and the Red Sea as part of Operation Desert Shield,
which involves more than 200,000 U.S. military personnel.
   O'Hearn said Saddam had developed elaborate defensive
constructions, including minefields. But the Navy has no reports of
mines in the waters of the Persian Gulf, he said.
   ``Up in Kuwait where he's dug in, he has put mines there, but as
far as the waters south of Kuwait, I am not aware that he has put
any mines there,'' O'Hearn said.
   In any case, the Iwo Jima would not land until minesweepers had
cleared out such obstacles, he said.
   The ship, carrying 30 Marine helicopters and a landing team of
about 1,700, is named for the February 1945 battle in which three
Marine divisions defeated a 20,000-member Japanese force on Iwo
Jima island.
   The Iwo Jima was stationed off Lebanon in 1983 during a U.S.-led
multinational operation to supervise the Israeli withdrawal from
that country.
   ``I would love to see this worked out in a peaceful fashion,
where we could get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and back to his
borders, and do it without the loss of life,'' said O'Hearn, a
native of Manitowoc, Wis., whose family lives in Norfolk, Va.,
where the ship is based.
   ``Any man who has seen war once wouldn't want to see it again,''
he said. O'Hearn was decorated for helicopter gunship missions
during the Vietnam war.
   ``On the other side, myself and my crew are ready to fight if
necessary. I definitely think we would give him a very good
licking,'' he said.
   President Bush has said he wants to give international trade
sanctions time to pressure Iraq out of Kuwait. But he has not ruled
out using military force.

<TEXT>
   The government Saturday agreed to cut
in half a 70 percent gasoline price increase, prompting some
cabbies to lift protest blockades that have caused nationwide
gridlock.
   Shortly after the pact between officials and the demonstrators
was announced on state television, taxi drivers moved vehicles that
blocked one of Budapest's bridges over the Danube River.
   But it was not immediately clear whether the 35 percent price
increase will be supported by all the thousands of protesting
cabbies and truck drivers whose vehicles have clogged the Hungarian
streets and highways since the initial price hike was announced
Friday.
   Cabs and trucks were parked across roadways or abandoned in
their lanes. Some motorists caught in the traffic jams late Friday
spent the night in their cars, but protesters Saturday opened some
roads to border crossings and Budapest's international airport.
   Earlier Saturday, a crowd gathered in front of Parliament to
rally in opposition of the gas price increase.
   ``Go home!'' Interior Minister Balazs Horvath shouted through a
bullhorn. ``The government wants order. We will keep order; we urge
you to keep order too.''
   But police did not attemptto break up the roadblocks, and at
least some officials seemed supportive of the protest.
   Budapest Police Chief Sandor Barna said he would obey a ``lawful
order to restore order.''
   ``But if it is contrary to my conscience, I know what I will do
- resign,'' he added.
   The blockades followed a government announcement that premium
gasoline would increase from 59 cents a liter to $1 a liter, or
about $3.80 a gallon. Under the 35 percent hike, the price per
gallon would be about $3.
   Similar hike were planned for other gasoline grades. The average
monthly net income in Hungary is around $150.
   The government said the price increases were needed because of
reductions in Soviet shipments and higher oil prices following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The protest represented the most serious sign of discontent with
the worsening economic situation as Hungary tries to move to a more
capitalist system. Elections last spring ended four decades of
one-party Communist rule. Hungary's more than $20 billion debt is
the highest per capita in the former Soviet bloc. Meanwhile,
unemployment and a housing crisis continue to grow.
   Before the smaller price hike was announced late Saturday,
Austrian, Czechoslovak and Yugoslav border officials reported
traffic out of Hungary was reduced to a trickle. The
Hungarian-Romanian border was closed to vehicle traffic.
   In the capital city of Budapest and other major cities, few cars
moved except emergency vehicles and food supply vans.
   Budapest's subway was the only public transportation operating,
and all but one of the Danube bridges had been blocked. The river
cuts across the capital.
   Not all truckers participated in the protest. State television
showed some arguing with their colleagues in an attempt to get
through.
   But the mood of the people in Budapest and elsewhere appeared to
back the protesters.
   Shoppers lining up for bread and milk in anticipation of
shortages joked with some of the protesting truckers brewing coffee
over field stoves.
   Several groups of youths set up picnic tables on one of the
jammed bridges laden with food and drink.
   ``The air will never be this clean again,'' one of them told
state television.
   In Bonn, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said a group of experts
would travel to Hungary on Monday to discuss ways of improving
energy supplies, according to a statement released by Germany's
federal press office.
   Kohl said he will urge the European Common Market to help
Hungary.
   ``Germany will continue to give friendly support to Hungary on
its way to democratic stability and economic improvement,'' Kohl's
statement said. It gave no details.
   Hungary's decision last year to let thousands of East Germans
leave the country for the West helped begin the revolution that led
to the Oct. 3 unification of the two Germanys.

<HEAD>Soviets Request Security Council Suspension to Explore Gulf Peace</HEAD>

   In a last-minute turnaround, the Soviets
asked the Security Council on Saturday to postpone a vote on
another condemnation of Iraq. Diplomats said the Soviets hope peace
overtures will develop over the weekend.
   The Security Council members were already seated at their
circular table, documents in hand and ready to vote on the 10th
anti-Iraq resolution since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, when
Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov rushed up to confer with U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering.
   They met privately with the French, British and Chinese
ambassadors, and then the Soviets requested a suspension of the
vote until Monday. As is the case for any of the five permanent
council members, the Soviet request was granted without debate.
   The postponement is ``because of the overtures'' being pursued
by various top Soviet, French and Iraqi officials this weekend,
said Yemeni Ambassador Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal.
   Chinese U.N. Ambassador Li Daoyu said the Soviets asked for the
delay to avoid complicating a meeting Sunday between Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and the top Soviet Middle East expert,
Yevgeny M. Primakov.
   Saddam has indicated interest in French President Francois
Mitterrand's proposal that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could
set the stage for a broad Middle East peace settlement.
   Such a settlement would involve a Mideast peace conference that
could lead to a homeland for the Palestinians, Mitterrand told the
U.N. General Assembly in September.
   However, the French president said it all depends on Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   In Madrid, at a news conference Saturday with Spanish Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
suggested the Iraqi leadership might be softening its hard-line
position in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   His remarks were interpreted as a sign that the Kremlin has made
progress in its diplomatic initiatives.
   A French TV station reported Friday that Saddam had sent letters
to both Mitterrand and Gorbachev expressing his readiness to
discuss Kuwait.
   The station, La Cinq, quoted Saddam as saying he was open ``to
all ideas'' for resolving the gulf crisis. French officials denied
knowledge of any letters.
   Gorbachev travels to Paris on Sunday for talks with Mitterrand.
   The Security Council was just moments away from voting Saturday
to hold Iraq liable for abusing the human rights of Kuwaitis and
foreign hostages, and for economic losses caused by its invasion of
Kuwait.
   In nine previous resolutions, the council has isolated Iraq with
an economic embargo and permitted U.N. member countries to use
flotillas of warships in the Persian Gulf to enforce it.
   The council also has demanded that Iraq unconditionally withdraw
from Kuwait and release all foreign hostages.
   The new resolution invites nations, companies and individuals to
document their damage and losses for the Security Council, although
it does not establish a system for making claims against Baghdad.
   It demands that Iraq stop taking hostages and ``mistreating and
oppressing Kuwaiti and third-state nationals.''
   The resolution also moved toward establishing Iraq's
responsibility for war crimes, inviting nations to collect
information on abuses of civilians contrary to the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949.
   The convention, which Iraq signed, protects the rights of
civilians in wartime or in military-occupied territory, outlawing
summary execution, torture, deportations and hostage-taking.

<HEAD>Corsican Separatists Claim Responsibility for Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Corsican separatist group Saturday
claimed responsibility for bombing a kitchenware factory. The blast
caused extensive damage but no injuries, police said.
   About 10 masked gunmen overpowered the factory director and
three employees Friday night in Aubagne, near Marseille, then set
off the explosives.
   The four captives were tied up, driven away from the factory,
then released, police said.
   The kitchenware company is a subsidiary of Societe Nationale
Corse Mediterranee, a major operator of ferries between Corsica and
the French mainland.
   On Saturday, a communique was sent to the press claiming
responsibility for the attack on behalf of the Corsican National
Liberation Front. The front has carried out scores of bombings in
Corsica in recent years as part of its campaign to end French rule
over the Mediterranean island.
   But Friday's bombing was the first on the mainland claimed by
the group since a series of attacks on banks and airline offices in
southern France in March 1986.
   The communique said the kitchenware company earned 75 percent of
its revenues from boats serving Corsica ``without reinvesting
anything on the island.''
   It described the Societe Nationale Corse Mediterranee as ``one
of the instruments that keeps Corsica in a state of dependence.''
   The communique demanded that the company relocate in Corsica.
   The bombing occurred the day after a visit to Corsica by French
Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, whose proposal for new,
semi-autonomous administration on the island has been rejected by
separatist leaders.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Army Conducts Huge Sweep of Gold Miners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers raided illegal gold mines in
the Amazon jungle and arrested more than 300 people, mostly
foreigners, Foreign Minister Reinaldo Figueredo said Saturday.
   Most of the illegal miners detained in last week's raids were
taken to Puerto Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River
about 400 miles south of Caracas, where they were to be tried on
charges of damaging the environment, authorities said.
   Since last year, the federal government has made more than 1,000
arrests in attempting to staunch an invasion of miners crossing the
unmarked jungle border between Brazil and Venezuela.
   The mining process, which uses mercury, has been blamed for
poisoning rivers and for the deaths of several Yanomami Indians in
Venezuela's isolated, largely roadless Amazonas territory.
   The government is trying to protect the estimated 14,000
Yanomami living in Venezuela, possibly the most isolated and
largest primitive tribe remaining on earth.
   Defense Minister Hector Jurado Toro said about 800 soldiers were
involved in the sweep. The troops dismantled mining operations and
detained everyone who did not manage to escape into the jungle, he
said.

<HEAD>Polls Show Labor With Wide Lead Over Tories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party swept to a 16-point
lead over the Conservatives in two new opinion polls, and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's personal popularity slumped further.
   A survey by the respected Mori firm to be published in the
Sunday Times, and a new Harris poll in The Observer on Sunday show
the Conservatives have lost ground over the past month.
   The Sunday Times poll showed Mrs. Thatcher's personal approval
ratings had dropped by seven points to 29 percent. Sixty-six
percent of those polled expressed ``dissatisfaction'' with the
prime minister.
   In contrast, 45 percent of those polled approved of Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock, while 42 percent expressed ``dissatisfaction''
with Kinnock.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has led Britain since 1979, is expected to
call the next general election sometime next year.
   Labor has been leading the Conservatives in the polls for
months. Recently, the government regained a little ground after it
announced entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and
interest rates were cut by 1 percent.
   But the recent polls indicate the gains were temporary.
   The Sunday Times poll of 1,043 voters, conducted October 24-25,
asked people how they intended to vote. The poll showed 49 percent
favored Labor, up four points over last month; 33 for the
Conservatives, down five points from last month; 14 percent for
Liberal Democrats, up two points; 2 percent for Green Party, down 1
percent. Other parties gained the remaining votes.
   The Harris Poll, which surveyed 1,043 voters between October
24-25, found similar results in voting intentions.
   No margin of error was provided for either poll.

   Coast Guard crews took advantage of
favorable weather Saturday to contain 164,000 gallons of kerosene
that spilled into the Hudson River when a barge ran aground on a
reef.
   The barge, carrying about 30,000 barrels of kerosene or 1.26
million gallons, ran aground and sprang a leak Friday night about
one mile south of Marlboro and 60 miles north of New York City,
said Bill Falk, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman in New York.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but high
winds and choppy seas may have contributed, Falk said.
   The barge hit a known underwater hazard called Diamond Reef,
which lies about 5 feet below the surface, said Coast Guard Chief
Petty Officer Alan Burd. Barges can di  3 to 9 feet below the water
when carrying a full load, he said.
   ``It was a known hazard and it was marked with a buoy,'' Burd
said.
   Petty Officer Howard Holmes said strong winds were keeping the
kerosene along the river's eastern shore.
   ``The weather is very much in our favor,'' he said. ``We're not
chasing oil all over the river.''
   An overflight by Coast Guard helicopters Saturday morning
determined that the kerosene was concentrated at Brockway, about 2
miles to the south, and had drifted as far south as the Newburgh
Bridge, another half a mile downstream.
   A sheen, possibly linked to the spill, was reported on the
river's surface at a water treatment plant in Poughkeepsie, five
miles north of the spill sight, said Peter Doshna, regional spill
coordinator for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
   Environmentally-sensitive areas were blocked off with
containment booms soon after the spill, Holmes said. They included
Wappinger Creek, less than a quarter of a mile from the spill site,
Fishkill Creek and Constitution Isle. The kerosene, usually used as
a solvent and for fueling lamps and furnaces, posed no threat to
riverside residents, Falk said.
   About two dozen Coast Guard and contracted workers used
absorbent pads, vacuum trucks and about 3,000 feet of containment
boom in the cleanup effort.
   The barge's New York City-based owner, Hygrade Operators, hired
a private company to help out. No charges had been filed against
Hygrade by Saturday, Holmes said.
   Aiding in the cleanup was the rapid dissipation rate of the oil,
Holmes said.
   ``We expect 30 to 50 percent of the product to evaporate or
dissipate within the first 24 hours,'' he said. ``In a 48-hour
period, we expect 70 to 80 percent to dissipate.''
   The barge, named Hygrade 42, was traveling from New York City to
Rensselaer, N.Y.

   Scientists searching for life on Mars
agreed Saturday that they must be patient and focus on learning
more about the environment of the cold, dry planet.
   ``If we're going to find life on Mars, it's not going to be just
sitting around in the dust someplace,'' said John D. Rummel, who
directs life biology research for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``We're going to have to find places on Mars that are more
likely to contain life forms than you would find at random,'' he
said.
   Rummel was among two dozen scientists from North America, the
Soviet Union, Europe and Japan who attended the International
Symposium on the Biological Exploration of Mars at Florida State
University.
   Three speakers cautioned that it was too soon to conduct direct
life experiments on Mars, but Rummel said most of the scientists
agreed the planet should be studied for insights that could lead to
a discovery of life on the planet.
   ``Mars is not considered by many people to be a lifeless
planet,'' Rummel said.
   Ten years ago, the landings on Mars during the Viking missions
detected no signs of life on Mars, the most Earth-like planet in
the solar system.
   Scientists believe the planet was once more hospitable for the
evolution of life than it is now. Conditions grew harsher,
primarily drier and colder.
   Rummel said some scientists believe that signs of life, either
past or present, might be discovered deeper under the surface, near
heat sources where water might be found.
   The latest data from Mars came from unmanned Soviet missions in
1988. The United States plans to send a spacecraft to orbit Mars in
1992 and the Soviets plan a 1994 mission that would land an
unmanned robotic rover vehicle and balloons to explore the planet's
surface.
   On Earth, scientists are studying volcanoes, ocean bottoms,
lakes and rocks in Antarctica and Siberian permafrost to see what
kinds of life can survive under Martian-like conditions.
   E. Imre Friedmann, a Florida State researcher who organized the
meeting, said there's a good likelihood that life once existed on
Mars.
   ``You cannot really express it numerically, you cannot quantify
it, but it is certainly good enough to justify serious effort to
verify whether or not this is really the case,'' Friedmann said.

   President Bush on Saturday called on West European
leaders meeting at a summit to keep Iraq from dividing them by
exploiting their desires to see the release of foreigners held in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Bush telephoned Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti shortly before
the start of a summit of the 12-nation European Community, the
first meeting of the leaders since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Bush ``spoke of the need for solidarity ... and strong cohesion,
also regarding the hostages,'' said Italian spokesman Pio
Mastrobuoni.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been making separate offers
to European countries to release foreigners who are being held as
``human shields'' at strategic locations in Iraq.
   Mastrobuoni said Italy did not want to give Saddam any inkling
there might be ``a break in solidarity.''
   ``We are solid and he is failing,'' said a British official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Western nations wanted the
hostages released but all of them - and not just Europeans,
according to spokesman Hans Klein.
   Saddam has recently allowed small groups of hostages to leave,
some after visits to Baghdad by prominent figures. Iraqi has said
it is freeing all French hostages.
   French spokesman Hubert Vedrine said the release of the French
hostages was decided unilaterally by the Iraqis and did not affect
French solidarity with the anti-Iraq coalition.
   British officials said they expected the summit participants to
release a statement on the Persian Gulf. But Vedrine doubted it
would differ greatly from previous community statements on the
issue.
   The leaders put off until late evening a discussion of a dispute
over a proposal in world trade talks for cuts in farm subsidies.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the community's
failure to endorse a plan for crop subsidy cuts ``was bad for its
reputation, bad for world trade, bad for our relations with the
United States and bad for developing countries.''
   Kohl's spokesman said the German leader and Bush talked several
times in recent days about the trade dispute, and Bush also spoke
to Andreotti on the issue, stressing the need for a quick
agreement.
   At issue is a community proposal for 30 percent reductions in
subsidies for major crops over a 10-year period beginning in 1986.
Some cuts already have occurred.
   The community's failure in six attempts, most recently on
Friday, to approve the package has threatened the Uruguay Round of
international trade negotiations. The talks are an ambitious effort
to revamp the world trade system.
   The farm cuts have run into opposition from Germany, France and
Ireland, which are worried about the impact on millions of their
farmers.
   Mrs. Thatcher has used the dispute to bolster her argument that
the community is not yet ready to move quickly to a political
merger and an economic and monetary union of the 12 nations.

   The Mormon Tabernacle Choir's announcer,
heard by millions nationwide on the group's radio show, has been
placed on medical leave and could lose his job, a Mormon church
official said.
   Sources at the station told The Associated Press the leave for
J. Spencer Kinard, 50, was prompted by allegations he lied about
his relationship with a 24-year-old TV anchorwoman, Jennifer Howe.
   Choir president Wendell Smoot said Kinard is on medical leave,
but refused to comment on the alleged relationship. Howe, who's
married, denies there's a relationship. Kinard, also married, won't
comment onwwhat he calls rumors.
   Kinard's future with the CBS Radio Network's longest-running
program, where he has been announcer since 1972, rests with the
Mormon Church's governing First Presidency, choir president Wendell
Smoot said.
   ``The matter is under review by the brethren,'' Smoot said
Friday. ``They are the people who called Spence, and if they
release him that's their decision to make.''
   Kinard is news director at the Mormon-owned KSL Television in
Salt Lake City as well as announcer of the choir's 61-year-old
radio program, ``Music and the Spoken Word.'' Howe works at KSL TV.
   Kinard said he had been given leave from both jobs for
``stress-management problems.'' He declined to address ``rumors''
about Howe, who also is on leave from her job.
   ``Right now I have been to some doctors,'' Kinard said
Friday.``Everyone agrees there is a stress issue. I'm dealing with
that and I expect to be back. And that's all I can say about it.''
   Kinard's departure was triggered by a staff meeting Oct. 19 in
which he admitted exercising poor judgment but said he had done
``nothing immoral,'' according to sources who attended.
   KSL executives would not respond to questions about Kinard's
relationship with Howe or his future with the station.
   ``Our concern is just for Spence Kinard and his truly stressful
situation,'' said Jack Adamson, president of KSL Inc., flagship of
church-owned Bonneville International Corp.
   But station sources said officials warned Kinard not to be alone
with Howe in April after reports the two were seen together in the
station's basement parking lot late one night in February.
   At the staff meeting, Kinard denied being with Howe that night,
although three staff members reported seeing them, sources said. He
also said it was ``pure coincidence'' he and Howe returned to Salt
Lake City on the same flight from Oakland, Calif., last month.
   From her parents' home in Dallas, Howe said her relationship
with Kinard was professional and not the reason her husband of 13{
months, Brad Goode, filed for divorce on Oct. 1. Goode is an
anchorman at rival station KTVX.
   Howe said Friday that her relationship with Kinard was
professional.
   ``He's my boss. He's my employer. I think of him as a friend,''
Howe said. ``I'm not having an affair with him.''
   Howe said she was disliked by her colleagues because of her
youth and her rapid rise in July from reporter to co-anchor of the
noon newscast.
   She said she intends to fulfill the remaining 13 months of her
contract, but added her future is ``a bit up in the air.''
   KSL weather forecaster Kent Norton was scheduled to act as
announcer for the Sunday choir broadcast for the second week.

<HEAD>Rushdie Says He Wants Reconciliation With Islam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie says he is optimistic that he can
work out a reconciliation with Moslems, but an Iranian leader says
the death sentence against the Indian-born author of ``The Satanic
Verses'' can never be lifted.
   ``I have to hope that the atmosphere is gradually changing. I
think there's various signs that it might be,'' Rushdie told CBS
News correspondent Mike Wallace in an interview for Sunday's
edition of ``60 Minutes.''
   In a separate interview, Rajei-Khorrasani, a powerful leader in
Iran's parliament, said the death sentence cannot be lifted
``because it is a religious fact, which remains there forever.''
   Rushdie, 43, a Bombay-born British subject, has been in hiding
under police guard since Feb. 14, 1989, when Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared his novel an affront
to Islam and ordered Moslems to kill him. Khomeini died June 3,
1989.
   Iranian clerics offered a $5.2-million bounty for Rushdie's
assassination.
   Among parts of the ``The Satanic Verses'' many Moslems find
offensive are a scene in which prostitutes are given the names of
the prophet Mohammed's wives, and implications that Mohammed wrote
the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   Rushdie said he never meant to insult the Moslem world.
   ``If I'm accused of calling the prophet's wives whores, I didn't
do it,'' he said.
   ``I'm not this kind of creature with horns and a tail that's
been painted,'' he said. ``There is actually very little in
`Satanic Verses' that hasn't been, in fact, quite commonplace
discussion in the Moslem world for hundreds of years.''
   Wallace said he met with the author at a police officers' club
on the outskirts of London.

<TEXT>
   HONOLULU (AP)  Here is the text of President Bush's remarks at
a news conference Saturday in Honolulu.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Let me start with a statement, and then be glad
to take some questions. But I've just been informed that the United
States Senate has just passed the House-Senate conference report on
the budget. And this completes congressional action on an agreement
to reduce the federal deficit by over $490 billion over the next
five years.
   This budget blueprint represents corrective action on a pattern
of federal spending gone out of control. We have put on the brakes
and the process has sometimes been painful. But I will sign this
legislation because for the first time, it makes significant and
long-term cuts in federal spending that should have a positive
impact on America's economic future.
   All political points of view have sacrificed to bring this
agreement about, and needless to say, I don't like raising taxes
and never will. But there is a price to divided government and that
means that I have had to compromise on items that I feel strongly
about in order to do what I think is best for the country and that
is to reach an agreement.
   At the same time, we've cut federal spending programs and
applied some self-discipline, a step that also may not be popular,
but the essential ingredient which has produced bipartisan
agreement is that we must get the deficit down, get interest rates
down, and keep America moving. And I might add, I am told that the
final enforcement provisions are very, very strong, so that we're
guarding against more spending - out of control spending next year
and into the future covered by this agreement.
   In addition, I am pleased that many of my proposals on child
care are incorporated in this budget reconciliation bill. The
legislation provides tax credits, grants and vouchers that puts
choice in the hands of parents rather than in the hands of
bureaucrats. So I'm very pleased about the child care provisions,
something I've been fighting for.
   I intend to sign the agreement. And I will also review closely
the various appropriations bills to make sure that they conform to
this new spending agreement. We've made the tough decisions and now
it's time to move on.
   And I am pleased that the Congress also has passed historic
Clean Air Act amendments which will reduce acid rain, urban smog,
and toxic air pollution. We proposed this far reaching
environmental cleanup legislation some 15 months ago with the hope
that this initiative by the administration would break the logjam
that had prevented a Clean Air bill from being passed previously.
This is an important milestone in preserving and protecting
America's natural resources. And I look forward to signing the
bill.
   I want to conclude by thanking everyone involved, including the
bipartisan leadership in Congress for their tireless efforts in
forging and passing the new budget agreement. The Speaker, Minority
Leader Bob Michel, the Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Senator
Mitchell and Senator Dole have all had to compromise some and they
stayed with it long, long hours trying to hammer out this
agreement. And so I want to take this opportunity to thank them.
   I'll be glad to take a few questions and then we got to head on.
   Q: Mr. President, you signed onto this budget agreement and your
- your negotiators negotiated with Congress, including the tax
increases that you vowed you wouldn't do when you ran for office.
Are you prepared now to give it a sound endorsement and urge
Republican candidates to go out and sell it to the voters as well?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No.
   Q: Are you going to turn your back on it and blame the Democrats
for the tax increases that you agreed with?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I'm going to say, ``Look, I've reluctantly
signed this. There are things in it that if I control both houses
of congress, wouldn't be in it''. But that - and I think the
Democrats will be saying the same thing. I notice some of them
saying yesterday that they felt we ought to have higher income tax
rates. One of the things I'm glad on is - glad about is that we've
held the line on income tax rates. A handful of the wealthiest went
up and 10 times that many of the upper middle income came down.
Some went from 28 to 31, others came down from 33 to 31. There are
certain things in it that I can strongly advocate. There are some
things in it I had to gag and digest. And so that's the approach
I'm going to be taking, and I expect everyone else will, too.
   Q: Mr. President?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yeah. We'll just go right around the corner.
Yeah, Laurie?
   Q: You say it's time to move on. Do you have any fear, or do you
think expectation that the whole - the atmosphere of the last
couple of weeks is going to haunt you in the election?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No. I don't think so at all. Sometimes the
president has to make a tough call. This is one of them. And I'll
be right out on the campaign trail advocating the election of more
Republicans to the Congress, and we wouldn't have been in this mess
if we had that.
   Q: Mr. President, how can you go out now and blame Democrats,
criticize Democrats, when in fact they more than Republicans helped
you get this budget package which you supported passed?

   Mikhail Gorbachev indicated Saturday that Iraq may be softening
its stand on Kuwait, and the Soviets forced the U.N. Security
Coucil to delay an anti-Iraqi vote in a bid to let peace moves
develop over the weekend.
   Speaking in Madrid, Spain, Gorbachev said the coming days might
bring clarification of a change in Iraq's position. The Soviet
president's envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, was to meet Sunday in Baghdad
with Saddam Hussein.
   In New York, as the assembled U.N. Security Council members
prepared to demand that Iraq pay war reparations, Soviet Ambassador
Yuli Vorontsov rushed to the side of his U.S. colleague, Thomas
Pickering, and requested a 48-hour delay on the resolution vote.
   The delay was granted. Vorontsov said later that the
postponement would allow Primakov's talks with Saddam to take place
in a less tense atmosphere.
   In Baghdad, French officials announced that most Frenchmen held
by Iraq would be allowed to leave Sunday. Iraqi officials granted
301 French nationals permission to leave but expressed reservations
about seven others, they said.
   The officials said negotiations were being held to secure exit
permits for the seven, who are accused by Iraqi authorities of
breaking their contracts and abandoning work at a government guest
palace under renovation.
   Vorontsov's intervention came after Security Council members had
agreed to adopt a resolution holding Iraq liable for war damages
and economic losses caused by its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We will have a massive vote in favor,'' the British Ambassador
to the United Nations, Sir David Hannay, had said earlier. But the
council postponed the vote until Monday.
   The new resolution would be the Council's 10th to condemn Iraq
since Saddam's forces invaded Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land
and money.
   It invites nations, companies and individuals to document
damages and losses, but does not establish a system for recovering
the money.
   Kuwaiti U.N. Ambassador Mohammad A. Abulhasan estimated that
Iraq has less than $800 million in assets in the United States.
Shortly after the invasion, many nations, including the United
States, froze both Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets.
   The resolution further demands that Iraq stop taking hostages
and ``mistreating and oppressing Kuwaiti and third-state
nationals.''
   It invites nations to collect information on abuses of civilians
contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The convention,
which Iraq signed, protects the rights of civilians in wartime or
in military-occupied territory, outlawing summary execution,
torture, deportations and hostage-taking.
   Finally, the draft resolution says Iraq must allow the immediate
provision of food, water and basic services to diplomats and
foreigners in missions in Kuwait City.
   After Saddam annexed Kuwait, making it Iraq's 19th province, he
ordered the missions moved to Baghdad. He surrounded them with
troops and cut off services such as water and electricity. The
U.S., British and French embassies are the last Western holdouts.
   At least 210,000 U.S. troops and another 100,000 from other
nations have been deployed in the gulf against Iraq's estimated
460,000 soldiers stationed in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   But Gorbachev reiterated Saturday that military might should not
be used to force Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``We shouldn't rush in a direction of the conflict that leads to
military methods of solution,'' Gorbachev said at a joint press
conference in Madrid with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The Soviet leader, on a three-day visit to Spain, indicated Iraq
might be softening its hard-line position on the gulf crisis.
   ``In recent days, there have been signals from the Iraqi
leadership that ... the solution of problems cannot be achieved
through ultimatums,'' Gorbachev said. He added that ``the coming
days might bring some clarification.''
   The French television network La Cinq reported Friday that
Saddam sent the French and Soviet leaders letters offering to
discuss Middle East problems. It said Saddam told the two leaders
he was open ``to all ideas'' in resolving the gulf crisis.
   French officials have denied knowledge of any such letters.
   Gorbachev travels to Paris Sunday for a 24-hour visit that
includes talks with French President Francois Mitterrand. The gulf
crisis was expected to top the agenda.
   French officials on Saturday received the final go-ahead from
Iraqi officials for the freedom flight of most French nationals
held in Iraq.
   An Iraqi Airways jumbo jet was to carry the Frenchmen home late
Sunday.
   Besides the seven that Iraq has balked at freeing, French
Embassy sources in Baghdad said 19 citizens had not signed up for
the departure. They said efforts were under way to locate them.
   Iraq has refused to allow most Western men to leave Iraq and
Kuwait, and many are being held at strategic installations to deter
a Western attack.
   Iraq's National Assembly said Tuesday that French citizens would
be allowed to leave. Baghdad said the gesture was in appreciation
for Mitterrand's statements suggesting that any solution of the
gulf crisis be linked to a solution of the Israel-Palestinian
problem.
   Western analysts, however, have interpreted Saddam's move as an
effort to divide the world alliance against him.
   To guard against such divisions, President Bush on Saturday
called Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti, who was playing host to
the first summit of the 12-nation European Community since Iraq's
invasion. Bush asked Andreotti and the other leaders to hang
together in their stand against Iraq.
   A British official said Saddam should not be lulled into
believing there might be a break in solidarity.
   ``We are solid and he is failing,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Bolivia Halts Extradition of Drug Suspects Pending New Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bolivia will stop extraditing suspected
drug traffickers to the United States unless an extradition treaty
is expanded to include drug violations, a government official said
Saturday.
   ``We have no plans for further arrests and extraditions to the
United States of Bolivian citizens without an extradition treaty,''
said Gen. Lucio Anez, commander of an special anti-drug force.
   President Jaime Paz Zamora's administration was criticized by
opposition parties and others after Thursday's extradition of Erlan
Echeverria, who has been indicted on drug-trafficking and other
charges by a federal grand jury in Miami.
   ``Echeverria has been the last,'' said Anez, calling the
extradition ``a political decision.''
   He said there is ``a list of extraditables,'' or suspected drug
dealers, wanted for trial in the United States. He did not
elaborate.
   Bolivia, one of the top coco leaf-growing areas along with Peru
and Colombia, has a 89-year-old general extradition treaty with the
United States, but it does not include drug trafficking among the
extraditable charges.
   President Bush and Paz Zamora agreed to a new treaty in
Washington in May, but the document has not been signed.
   Anez said the new treaty ``is under discussion,'' but he did not
give further details.
   U.S. officials have praised increased coca leaf eradication
efforts in Bolivia, where cocaine production has risen following
crackdowns on major cartels in neighboring Colombia.
   Earlier this year, Bernard Aronson, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for Latin American affairs, estimated at least 99,000 acres
of coca crops are growing in Bolivia.
   
   Echeverria, who was handed over to U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents, was a close aide to Col. Luis Arce Gomez, an
interior minister under Bolivia's former military regime who was
extradited to the United States last year.
   Arce Gomez - dubbed the ``minister of cocaine'' by DEA officials
- is presently jailed near Miami awaiting trial.
   Paz Zamora ordered the extradition of Arce Gomez, although he
still faces charges in Bolivia for human rights violations under
the regime of Gen. Luis Garcia Meza.
   Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in September modified his
nation's year-old extradition policy with a pledge that suspected
cocaine traffickers who surrender to Colombian authorities will not
be extradited.
   Gaviria, however, said the decision does not apply to those
captured by police.
   Colombia, the main supplier of cocaine to the United States, has
extradited several suspected top-level traffickers. But Pablo
Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, remains free.
   The cartel, named for the Colombian city where much of its
activity is based, has demanded an end to the extraditions.
Officials in Colombia blame the cartel for more than 500 deaths
this year, including the assassinations of three presidential
candidates.

   Tragedy eclipsed the Breeders' Cup on Saturday
with the deaths of two horses and the injuries of two toppled
jockeys.
   A 3-year-old filly named Go for Wand, fighting to keep the lead
in the Distaff, snapped her right front ankle and crashed to the
track just a stride inside the sixteenth pole.
   Go For Wand was later destroyed behind screens to shield the
crowd from her distress. Jockey Randy Romero, who took a heavy
tumble, was removed from the track in an ambulance, but returned
later to ride in the $3 million Classic.
   Bayakoa went on to win her second straight Distaff and was
greeted in the winner's circle by her tearful trainer, Ron
McAnally.
   ``I can't cope with this,'' McAnally said. ``It's like my wife
said, `They give their lives for our enjoyment.' ''
   A horse named Mr. Nickerson dropped dead on the turn during the
running of the Sprint. No cause of death was immediately
determined. Shaker Knit fell over Mr. Nickerson, but escaped
serious injury.
   Chris Antley, who was aboard Shaker Knit, suffered a broken
right collarbone.
   Some blamed the deaths of the horses on the track. Others blamed
the roughness of the sport itself.
   The day ended with Unbridled bursting between horses about 50
yards from the wire to win the Classic, the world's richest horse
race.

   PRESIDENT BUSH: Hey listen, that shows that I don't like
everything in the package. I mean, if I were all that enthusiastic
about it you'd have seen more Republicans voting for it. So nobody
got it exactly the way he or she wanted. But that's - now it's
behind us. As soon as I sign it, that's behind us. And I hope it
will have the effect of bringing interest rates down. But the
philosophy of holding the line on spending and holding the line on
taxes is my philosophy. And I will be clearly advocating that.
   Q: What kind of message will you use now, then, to replace your
``no new taxes'' pledge? You know, everybody was very accustomed to
that, all the Republicans. And I just want to know what slogan or
rallying cry -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, let me be clear, I'm not in favor of new
taxes. I'll repeat that over and over and over again. And this one
compromise that - where we begrudgingly had to accept revenues,
revenue increases, is the exception that proves the rule. That's
the way I'll handle it.
   Q: The exception that proves what rule?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: The rule that I'm strongly opposed to raising
taxes on the American people and that we ought to do a better job
of controlling spending. And I think we can. And so that's - that's
the message. It's loud and clear.
   Q: Will you reinstate today your ``no new taxes'' pledge,
perhaps ``no new new taxes?'' Do you think - remember after '86
that the Congress passed a resolution saying they wouldn't tamper
with it for five years. Do you think now the line should be drawn
again - and having made this compromise, you should now hold the
line on taxes again?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Absolutely going to hold the line on taxes, and
hopefully, the big thing is to hold the line on spending so
nobody'll come up and try to propose new taxes. But I noticed one
of the - one of the Democratic leaders said yesterday, well, he
wants to raise income tax rates. And he's going to have a whale of
a fight on it. This was a one-time compromise.
   Yeah?
   Q: Sir, you really don't seem very enthusiastic about this
budget deal. You don't seem euphoric, after all you and the others
have been through.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: That's right.
   Q: And I might - well, I might note -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: You got it.
   Q: - that it doesn't appear to meet your own objectives. You've
been insisting on a $500 billion deficit-reduction target, now only
$490 billion. Plus, I understand the deal is based on rosy economic
assumptions, over which there is much disagreement. How do you
feel?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I feel that it's been a long, arduous battle.
And I feel that every once in a while the president has to do
something he doesn't like, and that is to compromise. And I did
that here. And, so, I'm glad it's over. And I have to say that the
hours that the Democratic leaders and the Republican leaders spent
working this problem have just been exhausting for everybody,
including me, although they did much more of the work. So I'm glad
it's behind us. And I feel good that it's behind us, but I can't be
euphoric about every provision in this bill. I am very encouraged
about the enforcement provisions, because they are strong. And no
guy can go out and put in a - put in a new program without the
offset. The guarantees of enforcement are strong, and I'm going to
do my level best to see that they stay strong.
   So, I think - you're trying to describe mood. I'm pleased it's
behind us and I will be out vigorously campaigning on the campaign
trail for more Republicans who feel as I do about holding the line
on taxes and about spending. And we have a difference of opinion.
You have more people that wanted to increase - on the Democratic
side - these permissive spending programs. So the philosophy, the
fundamental philosophical underpinning - yeah, I haven't changed my
view on that. And I'm sure the liberal Democrats haven't either,
but we'll take that case to the American people.

<HEAD>President Says Budget Distasteful, But `Good Medicine For The
Economy'</HEAD>

   President Bush said Saturday that, as much as
higher taxes make him want to gag, he will sign a deficit
restraining budget deal because it is ``good medicine for the
economy.''
   peaking to reporters minutes after the Senate gave final
legislative approval to the five-year deal, Bush said he did not
expect Republican candidates to say they like the package as they
near Election Day Nov. 6.
   ``A lot of the members feel as I do, they were gagging on
certain provisions,'' he said. ``But I'm glad that it's passed.
   ``Parts of it are good,'' he said. ``No, I can't say this is the
best thing that's happened to us since sliced bread or the
elimination of broccoli.''
   But, he said, ``I am convinced this is good medicine for the
economy.''
   As to how the defection of many Republican members of Congress
reflected on his leadership, he said, ``If I were all that
enthusiastic about it (the budget package) you'd have seen more
Republicans voting for it.
   ``Now that's behind us, as soon as I sign it,'' he continued,
``and I hope it will help bring interest rates down.''
   On another matter, Bush said he U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf is continuing, but declined to say whether it would
result in additional 100,000 troops being sent as widely reported
last week.
   Asked about the prospects for offensive military action, Bush
declined to state the reason for the additional troops, but said,
``The purpose is to make clear to (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein
that his aggression will not stand.''
   He said he will make further decisions after consulting with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other top advisers after his
return to Washington on Monday.
   Asked whether Saddam is softening his position, Bush said, ``As
he sees the U.S. forces moving,'' in conjunction with other
nations' forces, ``he has taken another look, because we are deadly
serious.''
   Bush reiterated that any conditional withdrawal by Saddam from
Kuwait ``is unacceptable.''
   He said he also spoke Saturday to Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak about the Middle East situation, and that Mubarak also was
firm on unconditional withdrawal.
   On other subjects, Bush:
   -Said he plans to sign the sweeping Clean Air Act just passed by
Congress.
   -Dismissed as ``pure unadulterated gossip'' reports that various
members of his Cabinet and top staff would be leaving or changing
jobs. ``Not that I've ever heard of,'' he said. He called it
``sheer mischief'' and asked, ``Who writes this stuff?''
   -Refused to say whether he wanted Ed Rollins, a GOP political
strategist and co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, to be dismissed because he recommended that Republican
congressional candidates feel free to distance themselves from the
president's decision to compromise on taxes for the sake of getting
a budget agreement.
   He said that talking about such matters would divert him from
more important business. ``I get diverted if you try to get me into
some little staff matter,'' he told reporters.
   The president, taking an approach he has voiced on the campaign
trail in recent days, said the budget agreement ``represents
corrective action on a pattern of federal spending gone out of
control.''
   Bush said he did not expect Republicans, many of whom voted
against him on the budget, to like it or try to sell all aspects of
it when campaigning.
   ``There are certain things in it that I can strongly advocate.
There are some things in it that I had to gag and digest. And so
that's the approach I'm going to be taking, and I expect everyone
else will too,'' he said when asked whether he would attack the
Democrats as architects of the package.
   Despite the tax increases in the bill, he said, ``one of the
things I'm glad on is obviously we've held the line on income tax
rates'' against Democratic pressure to hike them higher.
   ``All political points of view have sacrificed'' to get the
agreement, he said. However, he praised the enforcement measures in
the package.
   On the Persian Gulf, Bush was asked if there appeared a chance
for a negotiated settlement of the standoff with Saddam. Bush
reiterated there is nothing to negotiate and that Iraq should
comply with the United Nations resolution demanding Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of the Kuwaiti government.
   ``I'm hopeful there will be a peaceful solution to this
question, but there can be no preconditions,'' he said. Further,
Bush said it appeared the U.N. economic sanctions were having an
effect and that Saddam was taking note of the massive multinational
military force deployed against him.

that this is a good deal?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Parts of it are good. No, I can't say this is
the best thing that's happened to us since sliced bread or the
elimination of broccoli. It is - it's got some good things in it.
But if it were doing it my way, or the Republican leader in the
Senate's way, or the Republican leader in the House's way, it would
be very, very different. But I think it is good that we have a $490
billion - I'd like to have seen $500 billion - but it's a lot of
money, $490 billion enforceable deficit-reduction program. And that
part, that overall part I am enthusiastic about. But how we got it,
I reserve the right to be as critical as the next person on that.
   Q: Mr. President, do you think it was proper for the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee to recommend that the party's
candidates distance themselves from the president on this?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Oh, I want everybody to be right with me on
everything I do.
   Q: Is the architect of that strategy, Ed Rollins, history as far
as you're concerned?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: That is inside the beltway - I know how people
love that. They thrive on it. I don't. And you know, ever since I
got out around the country not one person has sidled up to me and
asked me about that particular incident. And I'm going to keep my
sights set on the big picture and not accommodate you when you want
me to go back into that. I understand it - I understand it because
people thrive - what was that Laurie?
   Q: Is he out? Is he out?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I'm not discussing it, because we'd divert me
from the major goal which is to elect more Republicans to agree
that - as I do, hold the line on taxes and spending, get people
back to work in this country, by getting interest rates down, and
empowering people not programs and bureaucrats. So it - I get
diverted if you go try to get me into some little staff matter.
   Q: Conspicuously missing from that list of leaders that you
recited, Mr. President, was the name of Newt Gingrich. Some people
have suggested that you could have gotten a better deal if he had
not led the Republican revolt a couple of weeks ago. Do you think
that he should remain in his leadership position because of his
actions?

   A police officer accused of paddling two high
school students for skipping school has been reassigned, pending an
investigation.
   Police say Ronald C. Flanagan, a patrol officer in the
department's southwest division, will work in a desk job until the
investigation is concluded, a spokesman said Friday.
   Two 16-year-old students at Kimball High School alleged that
Flanagan struck them each five times Wednesday morning with a
paddle. The students said the paddlings occurred in a school office
after they were found wandering on a nearby street.
   Dallas police do not have authority to paddle students, said
police spokesman Ed Spencer.
   Flanagan, 26, has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment Saturday.
   School district policy prohibits non-school personnel from
administering corporal punishment, said Kimball principal Roosevelt
Vaughn.

   Darrow ``Duke'' Tully, editor and publisher
of the Ojai Valley News, is resigning to become president,
publisher and chief executive officer of Beacon Communications, the
newspaper said Saturday.
   Tully also is resigning as supervisor for other Wick
Communications newspapers. The resignation is effective Jan. 11,
1991, the Ojai Valley News said.
   Walter Wick, president of Wick Communications, said a
replacement had yet to be selected.
   Beacon, based in Acton, Mass., publishes 16 newspapers in the
Boston area with a combined circulation of 150,000. It is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Chronicle Publishing Co. of San Francisco.
   Tully became publisher of the Ojai Valley News in August 1987.
During his tenure, the paper expanded its publication to three
times a week in this town, 70 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   Previously, he was publisher of the Phoenix Gazette and the
Arizona Republic. He resigned in 1985 after admitting he fabricated
a heroic military record that included service in Vietnam and
Korea.
   Tully joined Wick Communications as editor and publisher of The
Williston (N.D.) Herald.

   Demonstrators protesting higher taxes and government spending
rallied Saturday in cities from Georgia to North Dakota to voice
their displeasure about the deficit-reduction package approved by
Congress.
   Outside Chicago's federal plaza, some of the more than 100
demonstrators waved brooms and carried signs reading ``Time for a
Clean Sweep'' of lawmakers endorsing higher taxes.
   ``Congress should cut its own budget,'' declared Jordan Rosner,
26, of Chicago.
   About 70 demonstrators also carried signs protesting federal
spending policies at a rally in Lafayette Park across the street
from the White House. President Bush was thousands of miles away in
Hawaii.
   The nationwide protest was organized by the Council for Citizens
Against Government Waste, a Washington-based coalition endorsing
limited government spending and a hold on federal taxes.
   The ``Taxpayer Action Day'' was planned for more than 160 cities
Saturday, as Congress gave final approval to a deficit-reduction
measure that raises taxes by $137 billion.
   At many demonstrations, however, the turnouts were less than
what had been anticipated.
   In Bismarck, N.D., about 50 people gathered at the state capitol
steps to vent their anger at Congress and at a federal budget they
said doesn't solve the country's financial problems.
   ``A popular theme these days is to throw all the rascals out,''
said John Gosbee, an organizer of the rally. He chided Congress for
increasing the gasoline tax by a nickel at a time of soaring
gasoline prices.
   In Georgia, protesters sarcastically mimicked Bush's 1988
campaign pledge not to raise taxes. ``President Bush, read our
lips: No new taxes,'' they shouted at several of the rallies.
   Only about 20 people gathered in the tax protest outside the
Georgia Capitol in Atlanta.
   Rob Schuler, president of the Georgia Taxpayers Action
Committee, blamed the poor turnout on competition from Georgia
Tech's homecoming game against Duke University.
   The Citizens Against Government Waste sponsored a rally at the
state capitol in Austin, Texas, and about 200 protesters gathered
in downtown Dallas, some carrying signs, ``Throw the spenders out
of office.''
   ``It's going to take a major revolution in American politics to
change the system, to change the way we are headed,'' said Mike
Ryan, Dallas County chairman for Taxpayers Action Day.
   Rallies also were held in a number of other Texas cities,
including San Antonio and Houston.
   The demonstrations came as Newsweek magazine released the
results of a poll by the Gallup Organization showing Bush had
slipped to the lowest approval rating of his presidency. The poll
showed 48 percent of the people interviewed approved of Bush's
handling of his job, down from 57 percent on Oct. 19.

   Xavier Cugat, the Spanish-born band
leader who introduced the tropical beat of the rumba to millions of
Americans, died Saturday. He was 90.
   Cugat died of heart failure in a Barcelona hospital, doctors
Jorge Rius and Jaime Pujadas said in a statement. He had checked
into the hospital Oct. 8 with a lung infection and failure of his
left ventricle.
   ``Coogie,'' as he became known to millions of Americans and
Europeans, became a star in the early 1930s playing Latin dance
music at the Cocoanut Grove club in Los Angeles and later at the
Waldorf Astoria in New York.
   Cugat and his band, the Gigolos, were featured in several
popular Hollywood movies in the 1940s and 1950s.
   Born Jan. 1, 1900, in San Cugat del Valles near Barcelona, Cugat
began as a violinist at age 12 with the Havana Symphony in Cuba,
where his parents moved when he was 4 to escape political
persecution. He had first appeared with the Cuban orchestra six
years earlier as a guest performer.
   Later, the 12-year-old musician, with his violin under his arm
and ``not a penny in my pocket,'' went to the United States. He
became a U.S. citizen three years later.
   Unable to find much work as a classical musician, he made his
way to Hollywood, where he drew caricatures of movie stars for the
Los Angeles Times.
   Rudolf Valentino told Cugat that the actor had to dance the
tango in a silent film and asked the musician to put together a
band to accompany him.
   That was the beginning of Cugat and his Gigolos. Thanks to
Valentino, they got an engagement at the legendary Cocoanut Grove
in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel.
   That engagement led to others at Al Capone's Chez Paris in
Chicago, the Hotel Chase in St. Louis and more than a decade at New
York's Waldorf Astoria.
   Cugat's career as a band leader stretched from the big band era
in the 1940s to the 1960s. He played the violin and directed the
band with his bow.
   ``I learned very early that everyone in the United States
specialized in something,'' Cugat explained in a 1986 interview,
``so I decided to specialize in tropical music - we called it the
rumba abierta then. Today they call it salsa, but it's all
basically the same thing.''
   His splashy, tropical Hollywood films like ``Neptune's
Daughter,'' in which he starred with Esther Williams and Red
Skelton in 1949, made his name a household word.
   Cugat had a history of heart ailments and high blood pressure.
He was hospitalized in Los Angeles before he gave up his band and
returned to Spain in 1978.
   But despite further heart problems and hospitalization, he
formed a new 16-piece band at the age of 86 and began touring
Spain.
   Cugat was married and divorced five times. His wives were Cuban
Rita Montaner, Mexican Carmen Castillo, Chicago-born Lorraine
Allen, Brooklyn-born Abbe Lane and Spaniard Charo Baeza, known
professionally as Charo.
   ``If I had it to do all over, I'd marry the same ones,'' he
said. ``We always divorced for our careers. You cannot play the
violin in Philadelphia when your wife is in Rome making a movie
with Marcelo Mastroianni.''
   Cugat had no children but raised dogs and wrote two books - ``I,
Cugat'' and ``My Wives.''

<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Remember the - remember, what was the give and
take in the debate when Ronald Reagan said, ``There you go again,
trying to get me caught up in something devisive.'' Newt Gingrich
stood out there in the White House - I'm not sure you were there
that day - and strongly endorsed Republican unity, and that's
exactly what should happen. So please don't ask me to relive the
agony of a budget agreement that I am glad is signed and is now
behind us. Yes?
   MR. : (Inaudible) - final question.
   Q: Well, do you feel that the Republican Party has been badly
hurt by this -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No.
   Q: And aren't you sorry that -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Never - (inaudible).
   Q: - and aren't you sorry that you couldn't have gotten more
Republican votes?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Not particularly sorry - not gotten votes,
because a lot of the members feel as I do. They were gagging on
certain provisions. But glad that it's passed. And I think if the
bill this - this compromise had been perfect from a Republican side
you'd have seen - obviously had many, many more votes. So I think
those that didn't vote against it on both sides had problems with
it.
   Some on the Democratic side were saying, ``We want to raise
income tax rates on the American people more''. That's literally
what they wanted to do. They called it ``soak the rich''. But, what
they meant was when that bill that they passed in the Congress for
that indexing went after every working man and woman in this
country. And that's the old tax and spend view. And some of them
didn't feel it went far enough. Some on our side didn't like
anything to do with revenues. That's more along my line of
thinking. So I think it - I think that's history now, but I have no
rancor about it. I'm just glad it's passed, I wish it had been
passed when we had the - the summit agreement and we'd have been
much further along.
   But I don't - and back to your first part of your question, no,
I sense strong enthusiasm for Republican candidates. And I think
we've been caught up in a bit of inside smoke screen here. But
let's see now how we do. I'm going to be out there working my heart
out for Republican candidates who feel as I do, that we ought to
hold the line on taxes and we ought to curtail spending.
   Q: Are we (headed for?) a recession?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I hope - the economy's sluggish. And there's no
question about that. And I am convinced, whether I like every
paragraph of this or not, that this is good medicine for the
economy, particularly if the Federal Reserve Board now follows up
with lowering interest rates. You know, that is what's needed and
I'm not here to - to do anything other than to state that - that
principle.
   But I listen carefully to Alan Greenspan's testimony and I was -
I was encouraged that interest rates might come down. Better than
any program is getting these rates down so economic growth gets -
gets stimulated.
   Q: You said you were going to review the appropriations. Has
that process begun, and are you certain that the appropriations
bills that have been passed are not raising spending levels at the
same time that you're claiming to have cut some and - for deficit
reduction?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, I'm not sure of that, Jessica. And I - the
process is under way, of course. But I'm not certain that there is
(sic) no breaches of the spending goals. Yeah?
   Q: Sir, if I could just switch to the Gulf -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: A couple more and then I've got to go. We've got
a very interesting meeting with these Pacific chiefs of state. It's
a fascinating and long overdue meeting and I'm learning from them,
and I am giving them as best I can right from the shoulder, the
American view, the importance of the Pacific. And I - I know that
given the budget summit at some and the interest that - that that
has stimulated, that attention hasn't been focused elsewhere. But
this is - this is a very important meeting, and I'd say historic -
with these small countries, but all friendly to the United States,
and all very important to the United States. So I've got to get
back down there in just a minute.
   Did I cut you off, Sandy?
   Q: No, sir.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: You've got a follow up then?
   Q: Just switch to the gulf crisis for a moment. Secretary Cheney
indicates we may send as many as 100,000 new troops in and a lot
more tanks. What's the purpose, sir, if it's not to - to take
offensive action and get engaged in combat with Iraq?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Hold it, just a minute. (Chuckles.) Power outage
here. We have not announced what we are going to do in terms of
additional troops. We have been still - as everybody around the
world knows - still moving forces. The purpose is to make clear to
Saddam Hussein that his aggression will not stand. And what I do in
the future will be determined after I have a discussion with Dick
Cheney and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Scowcroft, and
Secretary Baker, which I expect we'll be doing, looking for help
with Brent when we get back. And maybe we'll have more to say about
that then.
   But I believe - I believe a couple of things on this. One, I
think Saddam Hussein really felt that nobody was going to move
against his aggression in Kuwait. I also believe that he really
intended to threaten Saudi Arabia, else why did he move all his
armor south to the Saudi border? I think as he sees the US forces
moving in conjunction with many Arab country forces, in conjunction
with many European country forces in land and on the sea, that he's
taken another look. Because we are deadly serious. And I want to
see these economic sanctions work.
   I - I was - I'm not too good at the emotional side of it, but
when you talk to the parents of these - and spouses of our kids
half way around the world, it makes a real impact on you. Remember
when I got off the plane at the marine base and they - they were
saying, ``Take care of my husband'', and yet, ``We back you 100
percent''. So, there's - I don't think that's a conflict exactly,
but I want to take care of every young man and woman that's serving
the United States, half way around the world.
   But they want, and I want to see that Saddam's aggression is
unrewarded and indeed repudiated. And so the moving of US force up
to now has sent a strong signal to him. We have the finest, most
highly motivated, best trained, best equipped armed forces in the
world. And they're right there. They're right there in substantial
numbers, land, air, and sea. Now, Mr. Saddam Hussein, get out of
Kuwait with no condition. And this talk of some condition, that is
unacceptable not just to the United States, but to the other
countries around the world. I just got off the phone talking to -
(audio break) - it is encouraging. I am told that he now sees that
he's up against a substantial force that clearly could prevail in
any battle. And so I'm hopeful that there will be a peaceful
solution to this question. But there can be no preconditions. There
can be no - there can be no rewarding of aggression.
   Yeah?

   The birthplace of hostage Terry Anderson
marked the hostage's 43rd birthday Saturday with a flag raising, a
gun salute and two renditions of ``Happy Birthday.''
   About 40 people, including 12 of Anderson's cousins, turned out
at City Hall for the gun salute and flag ceremony, then walked to a
park to join 500 others.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted by Moslem extremists in Beirut on March 16,
1985. He is the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Anderson was born in Lorain and grew up in Batavia, N.Y., where
supporters decided against cake and singing to mark his birthday
because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   ``This year because of the new crisis it just seemed
inappropriate,'' said Anne Zickl, an organizer of past celebrations
for Anderson in Batavia.
   In Lorain, Anderson's cousins, including the Rev. Edward Jones
Jr. of San Mateo, Calif., placed a large yellow ribbon on the City
Hall flagpole in Anderson's memory.
   The group then walked to nearby Veterans Memorial Park and
joined 500 people gathered for the city's annual Halloween parade.
The crowd sang ``Happy Birthday.'' The band from Southview High
School, near Anderson's birthplace, played the song again.
   ``We wanted to get it real loud the second time,'' LaVriha said.
   He read the crowd a letter from Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
She thanked Lorain residents for their support of Anderson and
expressed hope for a prompt resolution of his ordeal.
   ``My thoughts and prayers are with you as we mark another
birthday for Terry Anderson - his sixth in captivity,'' she wrote.
   In years past in Batavia, a town of about 16,000 people 35 miles
east of Buffalo, residents gathered at a mall to eat birthday cake,
listen to music and sing ``Happy Birthday'' for Anderson. No
organized events were held Saturday.
   The threat of war between the United States and Iraq over Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait made this year's events for Anderson more
solemn, organizers said.
   A bust of Anderson sculpted by artist Louis Dlugosz was placed
Friday in Batavia's City Hall, alongside a scrapbook of local
events held in Anderson's honor over the past six years.
   Residents signed the scrapbook as they viewed the bust at City
Hall, where they picked up small yellow ribbons and bumper stickers
reading ``Bring our hostages home from Lebanon.''
   A group called the ``Friends of Terry Anderson'' held a
spiritual service Wednesday. A mass Sunday was to be dedicated to
Anderson and other hostages in Lebanon.

   Police shot and killed two men Saturday, and
security sources said the victims were Moslem extremists who took
part in the assassination of the parliamentary speaker earlier this
month.
   A third suspect and two policemen were wounded in the afternoon
shootout at Cairo University, police said. A fourth suspect was
captured by police, the sources said.
   Police were led to the men by a Moslem extremist, arrested
Wednesday, who confessed to particating in the slaying Oct. 12 of
Parliament Speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub, his driver and bodyguards,
the sources said.
   As speaker of the People's Assembly, el-Mahgoub was second in
line to the presidency after President Hosni Mubarak.
   A government statement issued late Saturday said the suspects
are members of the Jihad group, an underground Moslem extremist
organization linked to the Oct. 6, 1981, assassination of President
Anwar Sadat. The group is also believed responsible for riots after
the Sadat slaying in the southern city of Assiut which left 87
people dead and 156 injured, including many policemen.
   The extremists were trying to overthrow the secular government
and establish a theocratic regime.
   But security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
some of the suspects belonged to Salvation From Hell, an extremist
group that tried in 1987 to assassinate two former interior
ministers and a journalist close to Mubarak.
   Since el-Mahgoub's assassination, authorities have detained more
than 1,000 people - mostly Iraqis or Palestinians - for
questioning. The government suspected that agents sent by Iraq
killed the speaker, possibly in league with Egyptian Moslem
extremists, to punish Egypt for leading Arab opposition to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Security sources only recently began concentrating on Islamic
militants after concluding that bombs found where el-Mahgoub was
shot were similar to those used by fundamentalists in previous
attacks.
   One government source said the arrested suspect led police
Friday to a hideout, where they captured five men he had identified
as accomplices and weapons and ammunition similar to those used in
the Oct. 12 ambush.
   Police said the arrested suspects set up a meeting at the
university with other suspects, and the police set a trap.
   ``They had pistols,'' an officer said of the suspects. ``They
opened fire on the forces. ... The forces exchanged fire with them.
There were only slight injuries among the forces.''
   Ministry sources said the suspect detained Wednesday was among
those arrested after the attempted 1987 assassinaion of former
Interior Minister Hassan Abu-Basha. The man escaped during his
trial, the sources said.
   They said the hideout where the five men were arrested Friday
night was an apartment in a poor, crowded neighborhood in the Giza
district southwest of Cairo, where many Moslem fundamentalists
live.
   Shortly before the shooting Saturday, Egypt's prosecutor-general
banned local publication of information related to developments in
Mahgoub's killing.

   A man convicted of threatening to punch President
Bush in frustration over a tuition battle with a vocational school
was sentenced to 21 months in prison.
   Eugene R. Hains, 43, was sentenced Friday and ordered to undergo
psychiatric treatment at a federal prison in Butner, N.C.
   Hains was convicted Aug. 29 of threatening the president. He had
faced a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Hains was upset over a dispute involving a Southern California
vocational school, where he paid tuition with his veteran's
benefits. After he withdrew from a course, he fought with school
administrators for return of his fees.
   He sought government help. In a letter to a Los Angeles
television station's consumer advocate, Hains threatened to ``come
after'' the president if his demands were not met.
   The letter was turned over to the Secret Service. When an agent
questioned Hains about the letter in April, Hains told the agent he
would ``punch (Bush's) lights out'' if he ever got close to him.
   Hains' attorney, Robert Leen, characterized his client's
statements as ``ramblings of a frustrated citizen.''

   Q: There are two points to my question. There are some people
who are saying that the U.S. continues to send in even more troops
because the U.S. has underestimated the Iraqi troop strength. That,
coupled with yesterday apparently in Spain, President Gorbachev
apparently said he notes a softening on the position of Saddam
Hussein. Do you have any reason to believe there has been a
softening? Has Mr. Gorbachev told you something you'd like to share
with us? Has that softening manifested itself in any way?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I have not noticed a softening but I've heard
more - you know, kind of little threads of, talk of, quote,
``negotiation'', unquote. That's all. I mean, maybe that's what
President Gorbachev is talking about, but he has not shared with me
any feeling of a softening of - of public opinion. But, what was
the first part? I didn't - I'm afraid I didn't -
   Q: Has the U.S. underestimated, perhaps, the troop strength of
the Iraqis? Is that why we're continuing to send in more troops?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No. I think it's true that Saddam Hussein beefed
up his armor and his forces in Kuwait from the original deployment;
he then has stepped that up by pouring more armor in. I'll never
forget the day when he said, ``Well, we're taking our people out of
Kuwait.'' And they had one forlorn-looking soldier in the back of
the truck waving goodbye, the truck heading north, and then he had
all his armor moving south. And so it was a sheer fraud. And he
moved a heck of a lot of armor down against the Saudis.
   And so I - I'd leave it there, but I think that when you see a
lot of force there, why, the free world and those of us that are
allied together are going to say, ``Wait a minute, we're not going
to - we're going to do what we've got to do to protect American
life, or Egyptian life'', or in this instance, Syrian life, or
Saudi life. And that's why you're seeing a substantial movement of
U.S. force. And forces of other countries.
   I keep repeating this because it's a very important point. It is
not the United States versus Saddam Hussein, it is the United
States, big majorities in the Arab world, and the United Nations
versus Saddam Hussein. And that point - I keep making it, because
he is still trying to - trying to divide and weaken this strong
coalition. And he's failing. He is failing miserably because all
these countries are united against his brutal aggression.
   Yeah, Rita, and then Jessie. I've - I'm recanting because that
wasn't very kind. Go ahead.
   Q: Just back on the budget for a minute. What do you think it
says about your leadership and your ability to lead the party that
you couldn't get more Republicans to stay with you and vote with
you on this very important issue of the budget?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I learned a lot from Ronald Reagan, with whom I
worked closely, and watched, and learned. And in 19 - what was it,
'82? When we had that big tax bill, I think we got fewer votes than
we did today, and he went right out and did beautifully what he -
what he felt in his heart he should do and say, ``Look, I'm against
increasing taxes and the American people know this.'' And he went
right on about his business and that agreement brought interest
rates down, and we all went forth and said, ``Wait a minute, every
once in a while when you don't control Congress you don't get to do
it exactly your way.''
   And so I understand Republicans defecting from a package that
they don't like, that a president, to make something happen, once
in a great while, has to make a significant compromise. And that's
what I did, and I think the American people understand that. They
know that I'm trying pretty hard, and they know that I have their
interest at stake when I want to see interest rates down, and more
jobs for the working man and woman in this country, and that's the
way I'd handle that one. Now, the last one, Jessica, and then I am
leaving.
   Q: Well, there's Conventional Wisdom, and Periscope, and other
information from our weeklies that suggest there's a cabinet
shakeup in all of that, that the budget director's going to be
going to a financial firm, that the chief of staff will be going to
the campaign trail, that Skinner will come to the budget, all kinds
of things. Anybody else resign? Or retiring?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Jessica, you know something, I don't know who
writes these columns - Periscope. I mean, you talk about sheer
mischief and the ones I've seen - you go back and look at them.
Somebody ought to go - not you all, you do your job asking
questions. So I wish I were in the case to ask every - all the
knowledgeable people here, who writes this stuff? I mean, if
there's all that going on, I don't know about it. No! We - our
cabinet -
   Q: (Inaudible.)
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Not that I've ever heard of, and maybe I'd be
the last to know. But I don't think so. I think I'd be the first to
know, and I'd know it way ahea of Periscope, whoever he is,
whoever she may be. And it is pure unadulterated gossip that comes
out of these columns. It is not serious coverage. So - so, you know
I can't - I haven't even seen this. I guess they didn't dare show
it to me because I've been a little irritable lately trying to get
this job done. But - I'm going to finish my diatribe here.
   Huh?
   Q: Why would you be irritable?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Things aren't going exactly the way I want them
done. I wish we could have got this deficit down without touching
revenue. I wish that we could have got it done without all this
inside the beltway furor. Because it's diverted me from major
things - major objectives.
   Q: Do you feel abandoned by Republicans - (inaudible)?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, no, no. I feel happy about Republicans. I'm
glad this is behind us. And I wish we had more of them. No matter
what little philosophical wing of the party they're from, more of
them, all of them would be better than what I face when I try to
get stuff done from the Democrats. I mean, that's what it's all
about.
   Q: (Inaudible) - strategists, aides to Clayton Williams in Texas
who say he's losing points because you've come to Texas and you're
campaigning for him. How do you feel about that?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I feel they're lying. (Laughter.) Otherwise, why
has he invited me back? And I feel that my son, who I talk to who
talked to somebody high up, tells me that the - Williams is doing
very well. So please go to Texas and find out, and take a look at
how - whether the President can help a candidate in Texas or not.
Please don't get it from some ``Periscope'', if I might - now wait
just a minute here. I have a major national announcement here.
   Linda? Sorry. No, I'm glad to be in the place from whence you
cometh. And I might say, let me use this, seriously, to thank the
people in Honolulu - your home, I believe - that - for this
wonderful hospitality. And again, I want to end on a nonpartisan
note. I - I hope that you will record that this is a very important
meeting. The United States - we're caught up in Iraq, worries about
Saddam Hussein and the new developments in Eastern Europe, and my
desire to help lift the debt off countries in South and Central
America. But we never should neglect our friends. And we are a
Pacific power. And this meeting - some of these leaders come from
very small countries, but they are properly proud of their
sovereignty, they are concerned about the very problems that I
fight, whether it's environmental or economic growth, or revenues,
and for me it's been a wondrous day. And I think it is very
important that a president demonstrate, in this instance to the
people of the Pacific, that we are not going to neglect our friends
no matter how pressing the business of the world might be from
other quarters.
   Thank you all.

   State Rep. David Duke may appear after all on
``The Jesse Jackson Show'' in a flap over whether Jackson will
interview the former Ku Klux Klan leader one-on-one, spokesmen for
the two said.
   Jackson was scheduled to tape the interview with Duke, who was
elected to the state House last year, in Washington on Wednesday
for broadcast Nov. 3 on his nationally syndicated talk show.
   Duke spokesman Marc Ellis said producers of the show told Duke
on Thursday that instead of a solo interview, he would be part of a
panel discussion about President Bush's veto of civil rights
legislation.
   ``The Jesse Jackson-David Duke debate that we'd agreed to
earlier was to have been much more broad-ranging,'' Ellis said
Friday.
   Randy Douthit, executive producer of the show, said Saturday he
had talked to Ellis and Duke might still appear.
   ``We might have Jesse do a one-on-one with him,'' Douthit said.
   Valerie Scott, a spokeswoman for the show, said most of
Jackson's interviews are panel discussions.
   The theme of the Nov. 3 episode will be racism, she said.
   Duke, who disavows his white-supremacist past but campaigns
against programs such as affirmative action, was an unsuccessful
candidate for the U.S. Senate this fall.

   The White House, reacting to reports of
atrocities and massacres in Lebanon, issued a call for peace
Saturday and said, ``Now is not the time to settle old scores.''
   The statement, issued during a visit here by President Bush,
reiterated U.S. calls for the disbandment of all militias and the
removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
   ``For 15 years we have argued against violence in Lebanon,''
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``Now is not the
time to settle old scores. Now is the time for healing. The United
States has made this point to Syria as well as to the various
Lebanese parties.''
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
statement was issued as a result of reports of atrocities in East
Beirut.
   ``We have not been able to confirm these reports,'' he said.
``However, the seriousness of these reports and the history of
violence in Lebanon, we do have concern.''

   Sheena Jennings had an important question
about the Persian Gulf crisis that she didn't want to address to
the enlisted men and women, as her elementary school classmates
were doing.
   She wrote her letter to Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``I pretty much wanted to ask him, `If there is a war, do we
have to go to school?''' said 10-year-old Sheena, a fifth-grader at
Sutter Elementary School.
   To Sheena's surprise, the general wrote back last week.
   ``With respect to your question about whether you have to go to
school if there's a war, the answer is yes,'' Powell wrote. ``But
let's you and I and everyone else we can get to help us, pray hard
that there isn't any war.''
   Sheena said in her letter that she didn't like school much.
   ``School was very hard for me, too,'' Powell wrote. ``I always
wanted to be doing something else. But as I look back, I realize
that school was very important for me.''

<TEXT>
   A right-wing coalition was leading
Benazir Bhutto's party in early returns of provincial elections
Saturday, threatening the ousted prime minister with her second
defeat in a week.
   At least 33 people were killed and about 50 injured in clashes
between rival parties. It was the bloodiest election day in
Pakistan's 43-year history.
   The legislative elections in Pakistan's four provinces - Punjab,
Sindh, Baluchistan and Northwest Frontier - were considered a test
of strength for the Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit,
right-wing coalition of 18 parties that won national elections
Wednesday and will form the next government.
   With more than half of the 483 provincial races decided, Ms.
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party had lost nearly every race in
Punjab, the largest province. Her party was also in danger of
losing its majority in Sindh, Ms. Bhutto's home province.
   In elections Wednesday for the National Assembly, the
policy-making lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime
minster, the Islamic alliance defeated Ms. Bhutto by a 2-to-1
margin, denying her a second chance to lead this Moslem country of
110 million people.
   The 37-year-old former prime minister accused the army-backed
caretaker government of vote rigging, but a team of international
poll watchers said they found no evidence to back up that claim.
   The elections were scheduled after Pakistan's president
dismissed Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6, accusing her 20-month-old
government of corruption and incompetence.
   The four provincial legislatures were disbanded hours after her
government was dismissed.
   Election officials said turnout among Pakistan's 50 million
eligible voters was moderate to light Saturday, with many polling
stations empty. They reported a heavy turnout in Karachi, the
biggest city and Ms. Bhutto's hometown.
   More than 3,700 candidates were vying for the 483 seats in the
four assemblies.
   The Islamic alliance won 90 seats in the 248-member assembly in
Punjab, Pakistan's most populous state, while Ms. Bhutto's party
got only two. In Sindh, Ms. Bhutto had won 30 seats in the
109-member assembly; the Islamic alliance had won 4 and its ally,
the Mohajir Qami Movement, took 20.
   The Mohajir Qami Movement represents Moslems who immigrated to
Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent. It
once was aligned with Ms. Bhutto but later withdrew its support,
saying she reneged on promises.
   The Islamic Alliance captured 18 seats of the 83 seats in the
Northwest Frontier, holding a slight edge over a left-wing regional
party. Ms. Bhutto's party had four seats.
   Twenty of the 42 seats in the Baluchistan assembly were divided
among the alliance, the People's Party and two smaller parties. The
rest went to regional ethnic and religious parties and
independents.
   For Ms. Bhutto, the stakes were highest in Sindh, her provincial
home and power base.
   Sindh and its capital, Karachi, have been wracked by ethnic
violence that has claimed nearly 3,000 lives in the past five
years. Ms. Bhutto's inability to curb the bloodshed was one of the
reasons cited by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan when he dismissed her.
   About 100,000 soldiers, paramilitary troops and police have been
patrolling the country's most volatile areas during this week's
balloting, half of them in Sindh.
   Gunmen ambushed a car taking the son of caretaker Prime Minister
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi to vote in Sindh province, but Murtaza Jatoi
ran safely into a polling station, officials said. Police later
detained suspects, who were not identified.
   The younger Jatoi on Wednesday defeated Ms. Bhutto's husband,
Asif Ali Zardari, for a seat in the National Assembly.

<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Afghan rebel commander Saturday
rejected any political settlement in his country's civil war and
vowed to launch attacks to break a two-year military stalemate.
   ``Under no circumstances are we willing to share power,'' said
Ahmad Shah Massoud. The 37-year-old commander was speaking to a
group of foreign journalists at a walled compound outside the
frontier town of Peshawar.
   Speaking through a translator, Massoud said ``our strategy for
the war is not to start from one point but to attack different weak
points of the enemy.''
   The U.S.-backed mujahadeen gurrillas began their anti-government
campaign 12 years ago. They fought for nine years against both
Soviet military and Afghan government troops.
   Since the Soviets withdrew in February 1989, Afghan President
Najibullah has made significant political gains by distancing
himself from his Communist roots and embracing Islam in the
predominately Moslem nation of about 9 million people.
   The rebels, whose leaders are headquartered in Peshawar,
reportedly control most of Afghanistan's mountainous rural regions,
while government soldiers control the major cities.
   Massoud repeated a call for elections in rebel-held territory by
te end of March 1991. The mujahadeen leadership has been promising
elections for almost two years but so far has failed to take any
significant steps.
   Massoud's military threats could disrupt talks between
Washington and Moscow on a settlement of the conflict, which has
left 1.5 million people dead and 5 million refugees in Pakistan and
Iran.
   After several rounds of talks, the United States and Soviet
Union are expected to announce a final agreement by the end of the
year.
   The United States is reportedly ready to allow Najibullah to
participate in elections, providing he cannot influence their
outcome by remaining in control of key ministries.
   In the past decade, Washington has supplied the mujahadeen with
nearly $1 billion worth of weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles.
   The Kremlin sends $500 million worth of military and
humanitarian aid to Kabul every month.
   Massoud met recently with other top rebel leaders to work out
strategies, but he offered little evidence to indicate the
commanders would be able to to work together. Some of the rebel
groups have been involved in bitter feuding.

   A police officer who entered an
apartment Saturday in search of a prowler fatally shot the man who
lived there as he walked from his bedroom.
   Terry Barnes, 26, who was unarmed, was shot once in the head,
police said.
   The name of the officer involved was not disclosed. He was
placed on paid leave pending the results of a department
investigation.
   Police Chief Steven Bishop said the shooting was a tragedy but
defended the 32-year-old officer and another officer who entered
the unlocked apartment.
   ``This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr.
Barnes' family and for this officer,'' Bishop said. ``The officers
were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which
together led them to that apartment.''
   The officers were responding to a prowler report about 3:30 a.m.
at an apartment complex, police said. At the first apartment they
visited, two men reported hearing someone in their living room and
seeing a man run out the door, which had been kicked in, a police
statement said.
   While the officers investigated, two other people contacted them
and reported seeing someone running through another apartment
building in the same block. The officers went to that building,
entered Barnes' apartment, announced themselves as police officers
and began looking for the prowler, the statement said.
   The officer who shot Barnes, a two-year veteran of the force,
pulled the trigger after he opened a bedroom door and saw Barnes
coming toward him, police said.

<HEAD>Singh Holds Rally to Contain Rebellion in His Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh called his
supporters to a rally Saturday as he attempted to contain a
rebellion by party members who want him to resign.
   In a speech to 2,000 loyalists on the lawn of his home, Singh
gave no indication he was ready to step down. He pledged his Janata
Dal party would champion the downtrodden, as he said it had done
since he took office in December.
   Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi quit Singh's Cabinet on
Friday, accusing the prime minister of failing to keep his pledge
of honesty and efficiency. Four Parliament members once considered
close to Singh called on him to step down.
   Singh faces a no-confidence motion in a special session of the
legislature Nov. 7. Barring a last-minute compromise or a political
realignment, he seems certain to lose.
   Singh has been in trouble since Tuesday, when a Hindu-Moslem
dispute over rights to a holy site ballooned into the worst
political crisis of the 10-month-old government.
   He was elected largely on the votes of the middle and educated
classes who were disenchanted with the Congress government led by
Rajiv Gandhi.
   As prime minister, Singh adopted policies aimed at expanding
support with the poor, alienating many of those who put him in
power.
   He also opposed construction of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya, where
a Moslem mosque stands. That alienated the right-wing Bharatiya
Janata Party, and without its support Singh's coalition no longer
has a majority in Parliament.
   At least 93 people died last week in rioting between Moslems and
Hindus and police efforts to quell the disturbances.
   Police on Friday night clamped a curfew on Ayodhya and on the
neighboring town of Faizabad.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site
which they say is birthplace of Lord Rama, a Hindu god. However,
the mosque has stood there for 460 years.
   Police said they have detained 51,000 people in Uttar Pradesh
state and seized more than 35,000 tribal spears and other weapons
from Hindus on their way to Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi.

   President Bush promised disgruntled Pacific
island leaders Saturday that their pristine ocean will not become a
permanent dumping ground for chemical weapons or other wastes.
   They, in turn, told him that good will toward Washington had
``begun to dry up.''
   Bush asked the leaders for their understanding and support for
U.S. plans to destroy huge stockpiles of chemical weapons already
stored or en route to a giant new incinerator on Johnston Atoll, a
U.S.-held ring of islands 825 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   The president met for more than two hours with the leaders of 11
remote and economically vulnerable countries.
   Speaking on behalf of the leaders at the close of the meeting,
Prime Minister Geoffrey A. Henry of the Cook Islands said they all
wanted the Johnston facility closed, ``but we know of course that
cannot be done.''
   Standing alongside Bush, Henry also spoke of a ``huge gulf of
misunderstanding or misinformation'' between the islanders and the
United States on the problem of global warming.
   Expressing skepticism about scientific reports minimizing the
problem, Henry said, ``We'd love to read or hear what they tell
you.''
   Two Navy ships carrying 100,000 artillery shells loaded with
nerve agents from the U.S. Army's stockpile in Germany are expected
to reach the atoll next month.
   The weapons have become a major environmental issue throughout
the Pacific.
   The South Pacific Forum, an organization of regional
governments, claims that the use of Johnston Atoll could make the
region ``the toxic waste disposal center of the world.''
   In his closing remarks, Bush said the Pacific islands ``have a
special place in the minds and hearts of the American people.''
   However, Henry portrayed a different picture, saying the United
States was ``too concerned with the problems of other places and
you weren't as interested in the problems of the people of our
region.''
   Henry said Bush had ``begun to replenish the pool of good will
that has begun to dry up since the last war, the good will between
Pacific Islands and the United States of America. ... Don't allow
it to dry up.''
   Several dozen demonstrators staged a noisy protest about 100
yards from East-West Center where the leaders gathered.
   ``Don't Make our Pacific Your Cesspool,'' read a large sign in
the crowd. There also were protests against U.S. involvement in the
Persian Gulf.
   In advance of the meeting, President John Haglelgam of
Micronesia said Bush needed to allay fears of tiny Pacific
countries that the United States ``is ignoring them.''
   Opening the session, Bush said the United States will destroy
the toxic weapons ``only under extremely stringent environmental
controls and protections.''
   He said the Johnston facility would be used to destroy only the
300,000-piece stockpile already on the island and the weapons being
shipped from Germany, along with any obsolete munitions found in
the Pacific islands. That would rule out using the facility for
chemical weapons stored on the U.S. mainland.
   ``Once that destruction is completed, we have no plans to use
Johnston Atoll for any other chemical munitions purpose, or as a
hazardous waste disposal site,'' Bush pledged.
   He acknowledged that the whole issue `has caused many of you
deep concern. Our ability to move ahead and destroy chemical
weapons is a significant step toward disarmament and peace.''
   Tests of the incinerator are to end late next year, and
full-scale incineration is expected to begin in 1992. The United
States and Soviet Union have agreed to destroy such weapons by
1997.
   The State Department has issued a statement saying opposition to
the incineration project ``must be weighed carefully against the
long-term benefits both to world peace and the environment that
will result from the total destruction of chemical weapons and a
permanent ban on their acquisition and use.''
   Conferring with Bush were the presidents or prime ministers of
Fiji, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Cook Islands,
Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Tuvalu. Tonga and
the Solomon Islands also sent lower-ranking representatives.
   On another front, Bush reminded the leaders that the crisis in
the Persian Gulf has increased energy costs for the Pacific
islands.
   ``The gulf crisis underlines global interdependence, making it
imperative that all countries, large and small, join forces to work
for peace and democracy throughout the world,'' he said.
   Bush also said that the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a
government supported organization that helps private interests
invest in foreign countries, will establish a $200 million venture
capital fund and environmental investment fund called the
Asian-Pacific Growth Fund, and a $100 million Environmental
Investment Fund for sustainable natural resource development.
   He also said the OPIC would lead a group of American investors
to Pacific Island countries next year, that the United States wants
to negotiate an extension of the South Pacific Fisheries Treaty and
that the State Department's Agency For International Development
will set up four development assistance programs for private sector
development, emphasizing agricultural and marine resources.
   Aside from environmental concerns, the Pacific leaders fear that
U.S. development assistance will be cut back.
   They also wanted to press Bush to embrace the South Pacific
Nuclear Free Zone Treaty that bans the use, testing, dumping and
storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste in the region. The
administration has refused to submit the five-year-old treaty to
the Senate.
   The two-hour summit and luncheon were squeezed into a four-day
campaign trip featuring partisan attacks blaming Democrats for the
nation's budget problems and the need for higher taxes.

   William S. Paley, who cultivated a fledgling
radio network into the $3 billion-a-year communications
conglomerate CBS Inc., was remembered by colleagues Saturday as a
brilliant pioneer in broadcasting.
   They recalled his programming genius for both high art and
mass-entertainment programs, as well as a deep commitment to the
news.
   ``Anyone with means can collect Picassos and Gauguins, but it
took a Bill Paley to collect Jack Bennys and Jackie Gleasons,
Lucille Balls and Mary Tyler Moores and, at the same time, Ed
Murrows, Eric Sevareids, Charles Collingwoods and Walter
Cronkites,'' said Don Hewitt, executive producer of ``60 Minutes.''
   Paley, 89, died Friday night in his Manhattan home. The cause of
death was believed to be a heart attack brought on by pneumonia,
CBS said in a statement Saturday.
   Paley bought a handful of struggling radio stations in 1929 for
$400,000 and built them into one of the world's most powerful
communications companies. For more than 50 years, he controlled the
Columbia Broadcasting System as president or board chairman of its
radio and television networks and its film, publishing, recording
and other subsidiaries.
   ``The pioneer era in the history of broadcasting dies with
William Paley,'' said Cronkite, a former CBS anchorman. ``He
understood, as have few others, the necessity of giving broadcast
news a liberty to perform without commercial or political
interference.''
   ``He was a giant of 20th century business, a man committed to
excellence,'' said Dan Rather, Cronkite's successor at CBS News.
``Among his many accomplishments was being present at the creation
of broadcast journalism. He remained passionately interested in
news up to the time of his death.''
   Fred Friendly, who was president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966,
worked for Paley for 16 years. ``A lot of the fun and the glory,
the nobility that he possessed, has sort of vanished in the throes
of profits,'' he said.
   Frank Stanton, president emeritus of CBS Inc., said Paley was a
programming genius.
   ``Call it skill, inspiration or luck,'' he said. ``It takes all
of them, and he had all of them in abundance. Moreover, he had the
resources and the courage to implement his ideas.''
   Paley worked more than a decade past normal retirement age,
giving final approval to all major policy decisions. ``It's like
having a child,'' he once said. ``It's pretty hard to jerk yourself
away from that entirely.''
   Frank Sinatra credited Paley with giving him his ``first real
break'' in broadcasting. Paley heard Sinatra singing at a club and
put him on a CBS radio show that brought him to the attention of
band leader Harry James.
   ``Harry offered me a job singing with his orchestra and
everything skyrocketed from then on,'' Sinatra said in a statement.
``If it wasn't for Bill Paley, I don't know when I would've gotten
a break. He was one of the best friends I'll ever have.''
   The grandson of a Russian lumber magnate, Paley was born in
Chicago on Sept. 28, 1901. He studied at Western Military Academy
in Alton, Ill., and the University of Chicago before receiving a
bachelor of science degree at the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School in 1922.
   Upon graduation, he joined his father's firm, the Congress Cigar
Co., as vice president and secretary.
   Paley became interested in radio when he saw how successful
radio ads were for the company's La Palinas cigar.
   In 1928, he bought the year-old United Independent Broadcasting
Corp. with money borrowed from his father. He changed its name to
Columbia Broadcasting Corp. and begin building his empire.
   This year, Forbes magazine estimated Paley's personal worth at
$460 million.
   In April 1983, Paley turned the reins of CBS Inc. over to Thomas
H. Wyman, who had been president and chief executive officer since
1980. Paley stayed on as a consultant, director and chairman of the
board of directors' executive committee.
   When CBS' biggest stockholder, Loew's Corp., became unhappy with
Wyman's policies, Paley teamed with Loew's chairman, Lawrence
Tisch, in 1986 to retake control, Paley as chairman and Tisch as
president and chief executive officer.
   Paley had handpicked a series of heirs apparent in his later
years, and had no compunction about dumping them when he felt they
did not measure up to the man they were supposed to replace.
   David Halberstam, author of ``The Powers that Be,'' an
authoritative account of leading news organizations including CBS,
commented that ``because Paley hated the idea of turning the shop
over (to a successor), he failed to institutionalize the
protections he had given to the newsroom ... So CBS has slipped.''
   In his 1979 autobiography, ``As It Happened,'' Paley said he may
not have praised his subordinates often enough. ``I like to
believe, however, that they understand me and know how I feel about
them,'' he wrote.
   Paley became a fixture in New York's high society with the help
of his second wife, ``Babe,'' the former Barbara Cushing, who died
in 1978.
   ``The man loved to enjoy life - business and private life,''
said Lewis J. Paper, author of ``Empire: William S. Paley and the
Making of CBS.'' ``And he believed he could have it all - high
ratings and quality broadcasting and he believed he could enjoy
every material pleasure.''
   During World War II, Paley served with the Office of War
Information abroad and as deputy chief of psychological warfare for
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary
Forces.
   Paley divorced his first wife, Dorothy Hart Hearst, in 1947.
   Despite his reputed 80-hour workweeks at CBS, Paley also was a
trustee of the Museum of Modern Art and was one of the nation's
leading collectors of post-Impressionist masterpieces.
   Paley is survived by four children, two stepchildren and eight
grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be private. A memorial service was
scheduled Nov. 12 in New York.

   Congress agreed Saturday to renew for another
year a ban on offshore oil drilling along thousands of miles of
U.S. coastline from Alaska to New England.
   The moratorium on the sale of offshore oil leases was contained
in the Interior Department's fiscal 1991 appropriations bill worked
out by a House-Senate conference committee.
   The bill was adopted by both the House and Senate late Saturday.
   ``With this legislation, Congress continues to insist upon
protection of sensitive (offshore) areas,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.
   Congress has blocked oil development along much of the nation's
Outer Continental Shelf for nearly a decade through annual
moratoria on lease sales as part of Interior's budget.
   But this year, while the House had included the ban, the Senate
version of the bill had not, causing concern among
environmentalists. Oil companies have intensified their campaign
for increased domestic oil production since the beginning of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   But the lawmakers adopted the House version that broadened the
ban to include not only leases off southern Florida, California and
New England, but for the first time Alaska's Bristol Bay, the
eastern Gulf of Mexico off northern Florida, and along a 50-mile
buffer in the Atlantic from Rhode Island to Maryland.
   Drilling also is prohibited off the Pacific Northwest and, under
separate legislation approved earlier, off North Carolina.
   Last summer, President Bush announced that he was postponing, in
some cases for as long as 10 years, oil and gas lease sales off the
West Coast, New England and southern Florida until environmental
concerns can be resolved.
   Environmentalists, however, had pushed for Congress to renew its
ban to guard against the president backing away from his decision.
   The Persian Gulf crisis and subsequent embargo of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil has put a spotlight on America's dependence on oil
imports. As a result, the petroleum industry has campaigned for
opening parts of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas
development. The leases are held by the Interior Department.
   ``We had been nervous about this,'' said Lisa Speer, an attorey
who specializes in offshore oil issues for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, a private environmental group.
   She said the lawmakers' decision to keep the moratorium ``was
the first real test to protecting the offshore areas since Iraq
invaded Kuwait.''

   Ending a year-long struggle, the Senate on
Saturday passed 89-10 and sent to President Bush a tougher clean
air law to stem acid rain, urban smog and toxic industrial
pollution.
   Bush, in Hawaii, told reporters he would sign the bill, passed
in the waning hours of the 101st Congress. In a session-ending call
to Senate leaders, he called it ``another good step for the
country.''
   The legislation, totaling more than 1,100 pages, will impose
more stringent pollution controls on automobiles, factories,
coal-burning power plants and thousands of businesses. It cleared
the House on a 401-25 vote late Friday.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the bill
``a long overdue step to renewing our national commitment to an
active, effective and aggressive program of controlling the
pollutants that threaten the air we and all Americans breathe.''
   ``It's the most comprehensive environmental bill of the last
quarter-century,'' declared Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   But the legislation was not without ardent critics. Sen. Steve
Symms, R-Idaho, denounced the measure in a two-hour floor speech as
too expensive, a threat to economic growth and unnecessary.
   Although the legislation carries an eventual price tag estimated
at $22 billion a year or more by the year 2005, its supporters
argued that to do nothing toward cleaning up the nation's air would
be even more costly from higher health-care bills and related
economic losses.
   Congress first began debating the legislation more than a year
ago. Along with requiring new auto-emission controls and
cleaner-burning gasoline, it establishes first-time requirements
for industry to install equipment aimed at cutting the release of
toxic chemicals, including many cancer-causing agents, by 90
percent over the next eight years.
   And it demands, also for the first time, steep reductions in
emissions from coal-burning electric power plants that cause acid
rain.
   The House approved the measures Friday after two hours of debate
in which some congressmen expressed concern about the bill's cost
to the economy. Nevertheless, only a few members of the House voted
against it.
   ``This bill will be the standard by which we will judge
environmental legislation in the '90s,'' Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
declared.
   Despite the lopsided House and Senate votes, the legislation is
the product of months of intense bargaining, tradeoffs and
compromises.
   Among the provisions:
   -Smog-producing emissions from automobiles must be cut by 30
percent to 60 percent and gasoline sold in areas with smog problems
must be 15 percent cleaner toward the end of the decade.
   -More than 100 cities that are failing to meet federal
air-quality standards will have to develop pollution-control plans
to bring their air into compliance over the next five to 17 years,
depending on the severity of the problem. The Los Angeles area is
given 20 years.
   -Factories and businesses must install new technology to cut
toxic chemical emissions by 90 percent over the next eight years.
The requirements cover 189 hazardous chemicals including many
cancer-causing agents.
   -Annual sulfur dioxide emissions must be cut by 10 million tons
by the year 2000 to reduce acid rain. Midwest utilities that
operate the dirtiest coal-burning plants will be hit the hardest.
   Failure to meet the new federal requirements could open
polluters to civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day. Criminal
penalties may be sought against corporate executives for willful
release of hazardous air pollutants that pose a serious health
threat.
   Most of the new pollution requirements would be phased in over
10 to 15 years. The requirements for cleaner-burning motor fuels
and reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power
plants take effect by 1995.
   The clean air requirements are expected to have widespread
effects on society. Consumers are likely to pay slightly more for
automobiles as well as gasoline and, in many of the Midwestern
states, more for electricity. Small businesses and huge
petrochemical plants alike will have to invest in pollution-control
equipment and improve the monitoring of chemical releases.
   Cost estimates for the new controls have varied widely. The
bill's supporters have said the legislation will cost the economy
about $10 billion a year beginning in 1995 and about $22 billion by
the year 2005, when most of the requirements will be in effect.
   Industry estimates have been much higher, with some studies
predicting annual costs from the legislation by 2005 of more than
$60 billion.
   Voting against the bill in the Senate were Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.;
Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Steve Symms, R-Idaho.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., did not vote.

   Rusty editors, managers and replacement workers
wrote, printed and delivered the Daily News on Saturday despite the
absence of 2,400 employees in a strike marked by sporadic violence.
   ``The Fight For The News'' read the paper's front page headline
above a photo of strikers vandalizing a bus carrying replacement
workers. Inside, there were ads to fill the strikers' jobs in all
departments at the paper.
   ``New York's hometown paper is run by a bunch of out-of-towners.
It's not right,'' said striker Joe Burgess, who has worked in the
News art department since 1971.
   News management said Saturday that about 100 permanent
replacements had been hired already. Striking workers were welcome
to return to their old jobs at their old salaries at any time until
a permanent replacement is hired for that slot, said News vice
president John Sloan.
   ``Any employee that wants to return can do so,'' Sloan said.
``We have not fired anybody.''
   For editorial employees, the weekend was a time to consider the
future. Sloan has said some temporary writers and editors were
recruited from other Tribune Co. newspapers for temporary duty.
   Besides the Daily News, the Chicago-based Tribune Co. also owns
the Chicago Tribune; theSun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale and The
Orlando Sentinel in Orlando, Fla.; the Times-Advocate in Escondido
and the Peninsula Times Tribune in Palo Alto, Calif.; and the Daily
Press and The Times-Herald in Newport News, Va.
   The Daily News normally operates with a small weekend staff and
Monday's edition will show whether the picket lines outside the
News Building keep the news staffers away from their desks.
   The newspaper's Sunday edition had 96 pages in the news section,
compared with an 88-page news section last week, said Daily News
spokeswoman Lisa Robinson. Its front-page story, an investigation
into the state Liquor Authority, was written before the strike, she
said.
   As of 10 p.m. Saturday, early editions had not left the News'
three plants.
   The News published and distributed 710,000 copies of the tabloid
Saturday, about 200,000 short of a normal Saturday run, Sloan said.
Copies of the paper remained difficult to find in certain areas of
the city and the suburbs.
   The Saturday paper was the first one to hit the street prepared
and distributed without the unions, which began to go out early
Thursday in a job action that spread to nine of its 10 unions.
   The News claimed to have distributed 611,000 papers on Friday,
when eight unions were out. Editorial employees joined the strike
Friday afternoon.
   ``I may be committing economic suicide, but I feel like I'm on
the right side of the issue,'' said picketer John Wolf, a 24-year
veteran of the News advertising make-up department. ``It's not a
family paper anymore.''
   Police reported 12 arrests in strike-related incidents,
including one striker who allegedly attacked a replacement worker
with a bat and four News employees riding in a car with a shotgun
and a .22-caliber automatic.
   Missing from Saturday's edition were the bylines familiar to its
1.18 million daily readers. ``By Daily News Staff'' appeared on
most stories that were not wire copy.
   The 64-page paper included some features that ordinarily run in
the Sunday paper. A message to News readers asked them to bear with
the paper despite the ``inconvenience ... attributable to vandalism
and violence by striking workers.''
   A team of four editors covered the strike for the News; they
described the normally bustling city room as a ``sea of empty
desks'' dotted with editors ``long out of practice as reporters.''
   At stake is the future of the 71-year-old daily, which has been
in a financial tailspin for the past decade. The News has lost
about $115 million and seen daily circulation slip by about 700,000
since 1980.
   Unlike most strikes, though, there are no negotiations in
progress or planned. The News plans to replace the strikers with
new, permanent employees and continue to publish.
   Union contracts expired in March.
   A skeleton crew of about a dozen strikers walked outside the
Daily News building on Saturday, but much larger numbers turned out
the night before at News printing facilities in Long Island,
Brooklyn and New Jersey.
   On Saturday afternoon, strikers wielding bats attacked a bus
carrying replacement workers from the Brooklyn plant, said Sgt. Ed
Burns. One worker suffered minor hand cuts from broken glass, and
no arrests were made, he said.
   The News reported eight of its delivery trucks have been
firebombed and another 60 have been otherwise vandalized since the
strike began Thursday. Ten buses used to transport replacement
workers have also been damaged.
   The News is the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily after
the Los Angeles Times. The only union not striking the paper is the
New York Typographical Union, whose 200 members have lifetime
guaranteed jobs.

   Tugboats freed a dredge Saturday that
knocked out the only road link to the mainland for thousands of
people on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   Residents and tourists on Hatteras Island faced a 30-hour wait
for ferries, their only transportation to the mainland since the
dredge broke free of moorings in a gale Friday and hit Herbert
Bonner Bridge.
   The Northerly Island dredge took out a 369-foot section of the
bridge and snapped power lines that ran underneath the span,
leaving about 8,000 people on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands without
electricity and telephone service.
   Generators flown in by helicopter were used to restore power to
some people while utility crews worked on putting up temporary
lines, expected by Sunday.
   The temporary lines could not be put up until the dredge was
pulled from sand. It took three tugs about two hours to remove the
dredge.
   There was a six-hour wait to get on a ferry from Hatteras to
Ocracoke, where the wait for a ferry was 24 hours for the final leg
to the mainland.
   Residents were warned to conserve water and fuel. Their
predicament may seem daunting, but many consider such emergencies a
way of life on the islands.
   ``We're running out of gas and fuel, the usual stuff,'' said
Bert Austin, sheriff of Dare County, on Hatteras Island. ``The
local people are used to having problems. That's part of the
island's heritage.''
   Gwen White, a Dare County emergency management spokeswoman, said
the Hatteras Island water tank was about three-quarters full and
residents should have no problem if electricity were restored soon.
   ``Food supplies are still perfectly good and plentiful right
now,'' Ms. White said. ``As far as bringing food in the next few
days, that may become a problem if the ferries can't run.''
   Ferries couldn't run Friday after the bridge collapse because of
high wind. The forecast called for mild weather through Sunday.
   There have been no reports of looting, sheriff's Lt. Almey Gray
said.
   Ocracoke has about 3,000 permanent residents and Hatteras has
about 5,000 permanent residents.
   As for repairing the bridge, six months is the most optimistic
estimate given by state emergency management officials.
   People lined up for a 10-gallon gasoline ration at Dillons
Corner on Hatteras. Another station in town was out of gasoline.
   ``Since (rationing) started, it's been a mad rush to the service
station,'' said Cape Hatteras School principal Jimmy Webb.
   ``That's our umbilical cord,'' he said, pointing at the bridge.
``It's very inconvenient (to be cut off). But so is living in the
city.''
   The school's 536 students, in kindergarten through 12th grade,
will return to class Monday, Webb said. Until then, the school will
be used as a shelter. Red Cross workers were brought in aboard an
Army helicopter to set up shop there.
   ``Most people that live here are ready for a month or so of
siege,'' Webb said.
   At a National Weather Service station on Hatteras, workers
relayed messages to relatives on the mainland and transmitted
frequent public service messages on the radio. The station's
generator has enough fuel to last at least a week, said technician
Jimmy McClain.
   Jay Benda, from Rockford, Mich., and Karl and Kathy Gleiss, from
Clarkston, Mich., waited six hours for the ferry from Hatteras to
Ocracoke. The three were dismayed when told to expect a 24-hour
wait at Ocracoke, where traffic was backed up for 10 miles.
   The three friends have been coming to Hatteras every year since

   ``We're happy 'cause we got to sail three-fives,'' Gleiss said,
referring to a small sail used in strong wind.

<HEAD>Report: Liver Failure Killing Dolphins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Liver failure may be killing thousands of dolphins
in the Mediterranean Sea, The Sunday Times quoted scientists as
saying.
   The report said studies on some of the 10,000 striped dolphins
estimated to have died in the past three months found that all had
suffered acute liver damage. Researchers, however, were not certain
if the problem was linked to pollution, natural toxins in algae or
a disease similar to hepatitis.
   The disease was earlier believed by some scientists to be caused
by the morbilli virus that killed thousands of seals in the North
Sea two years ago. The Sunday Times reported morbilli has been
found in 60 percent of the dolphins examined.
   ``But its absence in the remaining 40 percent has raised a
question mark over the real cause of death,'' the newspaper said.
   Two researchers quoted in the article suggested there may be
other reasons for the deaths of the dolphins, which have been found
in Spain, France, Italy and North Africa.
   Phil Hammond, a biologist at the Sea Mammal Research Unit in
Cambridge, England, said morbilli virus may weaken some dolphins
after they contracted another disease that destroys their livers.
   Alex Aguilar, a marine biologist at Barcelona University in
Spain who is coordinating the international investigation into the
deaths, said the dolphins had liver lesions caused by some virus
other than morbilli or by toxins accumulated in the organ.
   He said the dolphins had lost most of their blubber, indicating
they were ailing for two months before death.
   More than 1,000 bottlenose dolphins have died since 1987 on the
U.S. Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Some researchers have blamed pneumonia, but other theories range
from cold winter weather to algae blooms, or red tide.

   Congress gave final approval to a record
package of taxes and spending cuts Saturday as lawmakers dashed
through a stack of major bills and toward adjournment of their long
election-year session.
   The Senate voted 54-45 to embrace the budget compromise, the
centerpiece of a $496 billion deficit-reduction plan - and
President Bush said he would sign it into law. The action came a
few hours after the Senate gave final congressional approval to the
most wide-ranging clean air bill in 13 years.
   The deficit-reduction measure reaches into the wallets of
everyone from buyers of gasoline to Medicare recipients but takes
special aim at the rich. Voting for the budget were 35 Democrats
and 19 Republicans. It was opposed by 20 Democrats and 25
Republicans.
   President Bush said in Honolulu that he would sign the bill
``because for the first time we've made significant and long term
cuts in federal spending that should have a positive impact on
America's economic future.''
   Noting that the bargaining that led to the budget has
``sometimes been painful,'' the president said:
   ``All political points of view have sacrificed to bring this
agreement about. Needless to say I don't like raising taxes, never
will. But there is a price to divided government and that means
that I have had to compromise on items that I feel strongly about
in order to do what I think is best for the country.''
   Congressional leaders made their ceremonial end-of-session call
to the president - this time in advance of actual adjournment - to
tell Bush that Congress was nearing the close of business.
   ``Your biggest problem is over, Mr. President. Congress is going
to leave,'' quipped Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, expressed
special gratitude to Bush for his support of tough clean air
legislation.
   Bush said, ``I know we've had some altercations along the way,
but the (tax and budget) deal you've hammered out is good for the
country.'
   As debate began on the measure - which sat 10 inches tall on
senators' desks and weighed 24 pounds - lawmakers said the
sacrifices it would demand were necessitated by years of growing
budget gaps that have helped weaken the economy.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said the
measure would begin a ``fundamental adjustment to too many years of
indulgence and excess.''
   ``It will be worse for America, worse for this decade, worse for
our children if we do not reduce this lingering, pervasive deficit
now,'' said the budget panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico.
   With two of the White House officials who helped negotiate the
plan watching from the visitors' gallery - chief of staff John
Sununu and budget director Richard Darman - opponents objected that
farmers would be hit too hard and that the measure imposed a new
burden taxpayers do not need.
   ``You're going to see the working, struggling people of this
country will be hit by increased taxes and fees,'' said Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
   But after 10 months of intense and partisan budget warfare,
exhausted lawmakers said it was time to close the deal.
   ``I've left my wife without much firewood out in the country,''
joked Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. ``It's time to get home.''
   Tired and testy, the lawmakers pushed to complete work on a host
of bills standing in the way of a hoped-for weekend adjournment,
including final passage of historic clean air legislation.
   -The House worked out some last-minute snags on Senate-passed
legislation embracing the first major overhaul of the nation's
legal immigration system in a quarter-century, and the bill was
passed and readied for dispatch to the White House.
   -Congress passed legislation that would establish new grant
programs for child care and increase tax credits for low-income
families with children in the name of child-care assistance.
   -Both chambers neared the finish of work on bills appropriating
money for government operations for the budget year that started
Oct. 1, including final passage of a $15.5 billion foreign aid
bill. When all in place, they will appropriate approximately $1.2
trillion to operate the government for the current fiscal year.
   -Congress approved emergency financing of the government through
Nov. 5, the fifth temporary extension of spending authority since
Oct. 1. This will keep the government going while the
deficit-reduction bill is drafted into legislative form and signed
by Bush. Federal authority to spend money technically ended at
midnight Saturday night. The stopgap was to be flown to Bush and
the White House said he would sign it in San Francisco either
Sunday or Monday.
   Just before dawn Saturday, the House approved the budget
228-200, with the support of most Democrats and a few Republicans.
Some representatives criticized the plan's taxes and others lauded
its whack at federal red ink.
   But all agreed with buttons some sported that pleaded ``Free the
101st Congress.''
   Even with the plan, the federal deficit will remain formidable.
The red ink for the fiscal year is expected to reach a record $254
billion, even with the $40 billion in savings the budget would
produce. The bill envisions that the overall federal debt is
expected to soar from just over $3 trillion to nearly $5 trillion
over the next five years.
   But lawmakers on both sides said it was the best compromise they
could reach. It was achieved only after a year that saw Bush
abandon his campaign vow of ``No new taxes'' and congressional
Republicans split deeply over taxes. Democrats achieved many
demands for taxes on the rich while swallowing deeper spending cuts
than they liked.
   The package, the fruit of six months of negotiations, was
originally designed as a $500 billion deal. But some unpopular
savings dropped out of the tax bill during last-minute efforts to
round up votes. Other savings will come from Pentagon cuts in other
legislation, and interest payments on the debt that will now be
less than expected.
   The bill would raise taxes by $137 billion, boosting the
9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax by a nickel and raising levies on
alcohol, tobacco, airline tickets and luxury items like yachts.
   The 600,000 wealthiest Americans, who now pay a 28 percent
income-tax rate, would enter the 31 percent bracket. The 4 million
others who are almost as well-off - including couples earning
between $80,000 and $160,000 - would see their rates drop from 33
percent to 31 percent.
   Itemized deductions would be reduced by 3 percent for incomes
above $100,000 yearly, and people earning more than that amount
would face a phaseout of the $2,050 personal exemption.
   The 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax would be deducted from
salaries up to $125,000, instead of the current $51,300 cap.
   Medicare, serving 33 million elderly and handicapped people,
would be cut $44 billion from the amount it was expected to reach
by 1995. Beneficiaries would shoulder $10 billion of that cut;
doctors and hospitals would bear the rest.
   The $28.60 monthly Medicare premium beneficiaries pay for
doctors' expenses would rise gradually to $46.50 by 1995. The $75
annual deductible for doctors' bills would grow to $100.
   Medicaid, which helps the poor afford medical care, would be
reduced by $600 million. But at the same time, there would be new
spending for the low-income elderly and children, some coverage for
mammograms and new restrictions on abuses by private health
insurers of senior citizens.

   President Bush and his top advisers will
decide next week whether to expand the mission of Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to Saudi Arabia to include other Arab
countries, U.S. officials say.
   Egypt is almost certain to be added to the itinerary as Baker
seeks to bolster the Arab coalition against Iraq.
   His stop in Saudi Arabia was announced Friday by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. At the same time, Fitzwater said it was
``not true'' that Baker would ask leaders of the oil-rich monarchy
to approve military action against Iraq to force its withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One bound for
Hawaii, Fitzwater said Baker and the Saudis would discuss ``the
implementation of U.N. sanctions, the status of U.S. and
multinational forces in the gulf, general defense needs, Arab unity
and military options.''

   MOSCOW (AP) - Foreign investors will be allowed to own companies
in the Soviet Union under a new set of decrees issued by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to help move the Soviet Union to a
market-based economy in two years.
   The decrees issued Friday also sharply devalue the ruble.
   They were announced as Gorbachev opened a three-day state visit
to Spain, where he hopes to obtain further economic aid and
increase trade with the West.
   The national legislature voted last month to give Gorbachev
far-reaching power to order economic changes by decree.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mayor Marion Barry says he plans to proceed
with his campaign for a city council seat even though he faces a
six-month jail term for cocaine possession.
   ``For the next few months, I will manage the District (of
Columbia) government and also continue my campaign for city
council,'' Barry in a brief meeting with reporters after Friday's
sentencing.
   Asked whether he should continue his bid for a city-wide council
seat, Barry responded, ``Absolutely. Why not?''
   He attributed the jail term to the inequities of ``the American
injustice system.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - William S. Paley, who founded CBS, the media
giant that brought such diverse programs as Edward R. Murrow
documentaries and ``I Love Lucy'' into millions of homes, has died
at age 89.
   Paley, who had been ill with pneumonia, died Friday night at his
Manhattan home, said CBS spokewoman Ann Morfogen.
   A cigarmaker's son, Paley bought a fledgling radio network for
$400,000 in 1928 and turned it into the $3 billion-a-year
communications conglomerate known as CBS Inc.
   The broadcast pioneer controlled the Columbia Broadcasting
System for more than half a century as president or board chairman
of its radio and television networks and its film, publishing,
recording and other subsidiaries.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth
admitted during a televised debate that he had ``wild years,'' but
denied swimming nude with girls.
   As Grunseth debated two challengers Friday, fellow Republicans
pressured him to quit the race, fearing his troubles could drag
them down to defeat.
   ``I can't say, Jon, you have to get off the ticket. . . . I
don't have that kind of power,'' said U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.
``But I can talk to him and tell him I think he has a future and he
should not endanger that future by running in a three-man race and
coming in third.''
   Grunseth is trying to unseat incumbent Gov. Rudy Perpich, a
Democrat seeking an unprecedented fourth term. State Auditor Arne
Carlson, who lost to Grunseth in the Republican primary, began a
write-in campaign after Grunseth became entangled in the
nude-swimming allegations.
