   A Vietnam-era commander who advises the
Veterans Affairs Department on Agent Orange said Wednesday veterans
should be compensated for 27 cancers or other afflictions he says
were linked to the herbicide.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.'s assessment came at the
opening of two days of hearings by a VA advisory committee on
health effects related to herbicide exposure.
   The panel's conclusions will help determine whether the VA will
award service-connected disability payments to Vietnam veterans
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated herbicide.
   The department has already decided to award compensation for one
related cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That decision was based on
a congressionally mandated study of cancer among Vietnam veterans.
The study, however, was inconclusive on Agent Orange exposure.
   Zumwalt was commander of naval forces in Vietnam, and ordered
that the herbicide be sprayed. His son, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, was a
patrol boat commander at the time and died two years ago at age 42
of cancer purportedly linked to exposure. A grandson suffers from a
birth defect also purportedly linked to exposure.
   Zumwalt has recently been an adviser to Veterans Secretary
Edward J. Derwinski and is a member of the VA's advisory Committee
on Environmental Hazards.
   He said his conclusions closely paralleled those of a group of
independent scientists retained by the American Legion, Vietnam
Veterans of America and the National Veterans Legal Services
Project.
   That group said earlier this month the VA's advisory Committee
on Environmental Hazards ignored a large body of data. The
scientists said they found evidence to compensate veterans for
eight ailments or diseases, and evidence to consider compensating
for 13 others.
   ``I suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same
conclusion,'' Zumwalt said.
   Zumwalt said compensation could be justified for 27 afflictions,
including soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne and other skin disorders,
liver disease, Hodgkin's disease, neurologic defects, birth
defects, leukemia and 13 other cancers.
   Derwinski was still reviewing the private report from Zumwalt
and could not comment on it, said spokeswoman Donna St. John.
   The government and veterans advocates have been at odds for
nearly a dozen years over the link between Agent Orange and various
diseases. The government Centers for Disease Control has concluded
that there is no way to determine which veterans have been exposed.
   Some 12 million gallons of the herbicide was sprayed between
1965 and 1970. The herbicide was contaminated during manufacture
with dioxin, regarded by the Environmental Protection Agency as a
probable human carcinogen.
   More than 36,000 veterans have been denied claims as a result of
the impasse. Derwinski, in deciding not to appeal a court case a
year ago, paved the way for the issue to be reconsidered.
   In another development dealing with Agent Orange, the Internal
Revenue Service said it has declared non-taxable the payments to
veterans from a fund established in 1984 by herbicide manufacturers
as a result of a lawsuit. Some 60,000 servicemen who served in
Vietnam from 1961 through 1972 or their survivors are eligible for
payments.

   Negotiators for El Salvador and its
leftist guerrillas met under U.N. mediation in Caracas Wednesday
night in their first direct peace talks since November.
   Representatives of the conservative government of President
Alfredo Cristiani and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
held their session at the Institute of Advanced Studies, a
government institution in southeast Caracas.
   The area was under rigid military control and reporters at the
scene said journalists were barred.
   U.N. mediator Alvaro de Soto said earlier no time limit would be
set and discussions would be held ``in the greatest possible
confidentiality.''
   ``One cannot solve a civil war overnight,'' de Soto remarked.
   The November talks were abruptly broken off after 10 people were
killed in the bombing of a leftist union hall.
   The 10-year-old war has killed 71,000 people.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria leads the government
delegation. Guerrilla leader Shafik Handal is the chief rebel
delegate.
   The two sides agree the the major objectives of the talks will
be political accords leading to a cease-fire and ``respect for the
rights of the civilian population.''

<TEXT>
   People don't fear the military as
they did when Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was in power, but
deciding on its role and personnel is a problem for the new
government.
   The new Public Forces include officers who were loyal to
Noriega. Many Panamanians question whether high-ranking officials
of the old regime have a place in the new order.
   ``Panamanians won't accept that officers of the old Defense
Forces could be those who, in a democracy, control the police,''
the newspaper Panama-America said. ``To think about putting into
uniform and arming those who for many years oppressed, punished and
tortured is not an easy task.''
   The military's makeup should be submitted to a referendum, said
Alberto Conte, leader of the Civic Crusade, a business and
professional organizaion that led the opposition to Noriega.
   Keeping Noriega's old officers ``doesn't offer any guarantee
that the new Public Forces will be efficient, respectful and
demilitarized,'' he said.
   Eusebio Marchosky, in charge of an effort to recover state
property stolen by Noriega and his cronies, said officers who had
served the dictator were hindering his work and retaining them ``is
against the national will.''
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, who is second vice president, interior
minister and justice minister, has said Panama's leaders chose to
keep Noriega's officers after the U.S. invasion in December because
``to exclude them would be to judge them categorically, and not as
individuals.''
   Officials of the civilian government have accused members of the
new Public Forces of crimes.
   Special prosecutor Rodrigo Miranda charged Capt. Leslie Loaiza,
head of the Judicial Police Academy, with involvement in the
kidnap-killing of Marcos Rodriguez Justines, 3-year-old nephew of
former Col. Marcos Justines, who was Noriega's second in command
and now is in jail.
   Officials say the apparent reason for the abduction was to force
Justines, jailed on charges of helping steal $47 million in a bank
scandal, to share the money. Why the child was killed is uncertain.
   Forty-seven other other Noriega officers are jailed on charges
ranging from misdemeanors to murder.
   Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy, but surrendered to
U.S. forces Jan. 3 and now awaits trial on drug charges in Miami.
   Arias said many Panamanians had suggested ``firing everyone and
recruiting from zero.'' On the second day of the invasion, he said,
the leadership had to decide between that and issuing ``a call to
service on new terms.''
   Forming an entirely new military and police force would have
meant asking U.S. soldiers to remain three to five years while it
was done, Arias said.
   Mario Rognoni, a legislator from Noriega's Democratic
Revolutionary Party, said: ``the idea of demilitarizing the country
is an error because a modern state must have the necessary elements
of security.''
   He said Panama is made vulnerable by its location and the fact
that it will assume control of the Panama Canal at the end of the
century.
   For more than two decades, the Panama Defense Forces were
responsible for all military and police functions, which now are
under civilian control
   This year's military budget is $80 million, about $70 million
less than under Noriega and only 3.5 percent of the total national
budget.
   Several specialized battalions Noriega controlled have been
disbanded, along with six schools or bases generally used for
military instruction. A civilian police academy is in the planning
stages.
   Panama's air force is run by the National Air Service and 12 of
its more costly planes are assigned to the Treasury Ministry. The
navy and marines no longer exist.
   ``There will be nobody in uniform in charge of all services,'' a
role reserved for the civilian president, Arias said.
   He said a commission concluded the ratio of security forces to
citizens should be 4 to 1,000, meaning 8,000 officers, but that
Panama needed 12,000 because of its forests and special maritime
needs. The commission was made up of security officials from Spain,
Argentina and Costa Rica, which disbanded its army more than 40
years ago.
   Noriega's Defense Forces numbered about 15,000.

<TEXT>
   The following is a chronology of important events since the
leftist Sandinistas came to power nearly 11 years ago in Nicaragua,
and relinquished power April 25 to the government of Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro:
   _July 19, 1979: The Sandinista National Liberation Front enters
the capital Managua two days after longtime dictator Anastasio
Somoza flees the country.
   _November 1980: First attacks by anti-Sandinistas who become
known as the Contras, short for the Spanish word for
counterrevolutionary.
   _February 1981: Reagan administration suspends U.S. aid.
   _November 1982: First reports emerge of covert U.S. aid to the
Contras.
   _May 1, 1985: Reagan announces trade embargo against Nicaragua.
   _Aug. 13, 1986: U.S. Senate approves $100 million military aid
package passed earlier by the House.
   _Nov. 25, 1986: U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese says some
profits from the sale of American arms to Iran were secretly
diverted to the Contras in an operation under Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North.
   _Aug. 7, 1987: Five Central American presidents sign a regional
peace plan.
   _Feb. 3, 1988: Congress cuts off military aid to the Contras.
Non-lethal aid continues.
   _April 1, 1988: A formal 60-day truce begins following first
direct meeting between Sandinistas and Contras.
   _May 31, 1988: The Sandinistas decide to extend the cease-fire
on a month- to-month basis; the Contras say they consider the truce
indefinite. Fighting slackens.
   _Feb. 14, 1989: Five Central American presidents agree the
Contras should be demobilized. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
agrees to hold free and fair elections in 1990.
   _April 28: President Bush signs a $49 million non-lethal aid

attacks and the infiltration of thousands of Contra troops.
Fighting surges briefly.
   _Feb. 25: Elections monitored by thousands of international

nation weary of war and financial ruin, the latter caused in part
by U.S. economic embargo.
   _Feb. 27: The Sandinistas say the Contras have to demobilize
before they will hand over control of police and armed forces.
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro calls on Contras to
disband, saying the elections mean there is no reason to keep
fighting.
   _March 13: President Bush lifts the economic embargo and asks
Congress for $300 million in aid, including $45 million to
demobilize and relocate the Contras.
   _March 27: Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the United National

that calls for depoliticizing the Sandinista army.
   _April 19: Sandinistas, Contras and the coalition agree on a
cease-fire and the immediate concentration of the Contras in
security zones. The Contras agree to begin surrendering their
weapons on April 25, inauguration day, and to disband by June 10.
   _April 25: Sandinistas and former President Ortega hand over
power to Mrs. Chamorro in peaceful transition of government in a
Managua baseball stadium. Ortega's brother remains on to head army.
Animated crowd in the stadium is divided into Sandinista supporters
and those backing Mrs. Chamorro.
   _May 15: Mrs. Chamorro in her government's largest challenge

   The Simon Wiesenthal Center said Tuesday it
inadvertently invited Frederic Malek to be vice-chairman of an
event that will commemorate the Holocaust.
   Malek, president of Northwest Airlines, resigned from George
Bush's presidential campaign in September 1988 after admitting he
had drawn up a list of Jewish officials in the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics in 1971.
   Malek has since told numerous Jewish groups that he is not
anti-Semitic. He said he had acted under intense pressure from
then-President Nixon, who thought a ``Jewish cabal'' was trying to
undercut his record on the economy.
   ``The New York office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center contacted
every major American corporation, soliciting participation by their
chairman-president for its regional dinner on June 6 in Manhattan,
said Rhonda Barad, Eastern regional director.
   The dinner will honor journalists who covered the horrors of the
Holocaust. The chairman is British publisher Robert Maxwell, a
Holocaust survivor.
   Barad said that had center realized the same Frederic Malek
involved in the 1971 controversy was president of Northwest
Airlines, ``the invitation to serve as a vice chairman would not
have been extended.''
   Malek accepted the offer, however, and his name appears on
invitations to the $500-a-plate dinner. It appeared he will remain
on the guest list, although Barad did not immediately return calls
to confirm that.
   ``Frederic Malek has apologized publicly for his actions in the
Nixon administration and his apology was accepted publicly by
Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, among other Jewish
leaders,'' the statement noted.
   ``Perhaps he wants to make amends, which is why he responded to
the letter,'' Barad told the New York Post, which first reported
the story in Tuesday's editions.
   Malek did not immediately return calls requesting comment, but a
Northwest Airlines spokesman, Bob Gibbons, said:
   ``Fred Malek made his peace with Jewish organizations a number
of years ago. They support him. I don't know where the controversy
is coming from.''
   He currently is in charge of housing, transportation and
security for this summer's economic summit meeting of Western
leaders in Houston.

   LITHUANIA _ The Supreme Council parliament declared the republic
of 3.8 million independent on March 11. The Kremlin has since
imposed an economic embargo of oil, natural gas and other raw
materials in an effort to force the republic to back off on some of
its laws that foster independence. Lithuanian officials say the
blockade has cost thousands of jobs, and they are pressing for
negotiations with Moscow. The Lithuanian parliament is expected to
discuss new proposals for the Kremlin on Wednesday, and Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene says she expects talks to begin this

   ESTONIA _ The Supreme Soviet parliament on March 30 declared the
Soviet Union an occupying power and pledged to restore full
independence gradually. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
first offered Estonia, a republic of 1.5 million, ``special
status'' in a revamped Soviet federation if it would drop its
independence bid. But Estonia persisted. Last week, it dropped the
trappings of Soviet power and the words ``Soviet Socialist'' from
its name, leaving ``The Republic of Estonia.'' On Monday, Gorbachev
issued a presidential decree that said the Estonian declaration of
March 30 was illegal.

   LATVIA _ The Latvian Supreme Soviet parliament declared
independence May 4, but the measure calls for a transition period
of unspecified length. About 54 percent of the republic's
population of 2.7 million is Latvian. The rest are mainly Russians,
many of whom oppose independence. Like Estonia, Latvia first got an
offer from Gorbachev of special status in a renewed federation, but
its independence declaration amounted to a rejection of that offer.
Monday's presidential decrees also declared the Latvian declaration
invalid.

   A computerized weather station atop
the Sphinx will begin transmitting data that scientists hope will
help them stop the monument's alarming decay.
   ``The Sphinx has deteriorated more in the last 50 years than in
all previous centuries of its existence combined,'' Sayed Tawfik,
Egypt's chairman of antiquities, said Tuesday.
   The $200,000 solar-powered station was developed by the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., for a project in
China and was adapted for the Sphinx.
   People have worked for thousands of years to keep the
4,600-year-old crouching lion with a pharaoh's face from falling
apart, but nothing has worked for very long.
   Rocks still fall from the structure, located at the base of the
Giza Pyramids. A large stone fell from the great beast's shoulder
in February 1988, provoking an international outcry.
   The massive stone face now is covered with scaffolding. Egyptian
conservationists are removing and replacing blocks already restored
on the right paw and sides, trying to make the Sphinx look like its
old self.
   The 200-pound, 6{ foot-tall weather station, installed Tuesday,
sits piggyback on the Sphinx's back, held in place by sandbags.
   Scientists said the monitor will remain in place for at least a
year, transmitting data to a computer a mile away.
   It will monitor rainfall, wind direction and speed, relative
humidity, pollutants, temperature and the effects of water and salt
on the limestone layers that make up the statue. All are possible
causes of the monument's problems, said Frank Preusser, acting
co-director of the Getty conservation team.
   An adjacent instrument measures solar radiation.
   Preusser said data from the new project should help Egyptian
officials develop a plan to save the Sphinx.
   ``The Sphinx s perhaps the most famed, and by far the most
thoroughly documented and scrutinized, monument of the ancient
world,'' he said. ``There has never been a coordinated effort to
methodically quantify and examine ... factors affecting it.
   ``We can't stop deterioration of any monument in the world, but
there is always a solution to slowing the decay.''
   Tawfik called the Sphinx ``the greatest symbol of our heritage.''

<DATELINE>PILSEN, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To say they like beer in this
brewing city would be an understatement. It's like a religion.
   Any city that would mark the 45th anniversary of its World War
II liberation by filling a surplus battle tank with the famous
local brew and drinking it in one evening takes its guzzling
seriously.
   So it's no wonder Pilsen is headquarters for the national Party
of the Friends of Beer, membership 5,100.
   Czechoslovakia is gearing up for its first free elections since
1946, and the Friends of Beer hope to win at least a handful of
seats to ensure all those beery late-night arguments aren't for
naught.
   Organizers say they are ``completely serious.''
   ``Politics was always a favorite subject in Czechoslovak pubs,
but it never led to any action,'' said Ludek Sibr, a 25-year-old
student teacher and a founder of the party.
   Now, he said, pub sitters who dream up answers to
Czechoslovakia's many problems could contact their own
representatives in parliament.
   The party is concerned with general social and cultural
problems, private enterprise and competition, said Sibr and Antonin
Jelinek, the group's Prague campaign manager.
   But its chief goal is improving pubs ``to restore friendly
relations between neighbors and not just to promote consumption of
alcohol,'' Jelinek said.
   Many believe that during 41 years of Communist rule the culture
of beer drinking declined. Under state management, the once warm
and friendly pubs became ugly, unclean filling stations for
alcoholics.
   The feel of an English pub is what the Friends of Beer aim for,
Sibr said.
   His party arose out of a student strike in Pilsen that was part
of last November's peaceful revolution. After the Communists were
toppled, participants looked for a way to stay active.
   A joking suggestion to form a beer-drinkers' party led to
unsolicited membership applications in the mail. The students
decided to establish a real political party.
   The party registered, held a national congress and collected
enough signatures to get on the ballot.
   The average member is a 35-year-old male, Sibr said. But the
oldest is 79, and 15 percent of the members are women.
   It is doubtful Friends of Beer will get the minimum 5 percent of
the votes needed in the June 8 elections to qualify for seats in
the federal parliament, but it does have a chance of making the 5
percent cutoff for the Czech regional parliament, Jelinek said.
   Just like the other 22 parties that made the ballot, Friends of
Beer is entitled to four hours of free advertising on radio and TV.
   The spots aim to entertain, Jelinek said. One shows a cartoon on
how to drink a glass of beer.

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruben Rocha thinks his ancestors were
robbed, and he wants the U.S. government to pay.
   Rocha leads a group of descendants of early Texas landowners who
want the U.S. government to compensate them for some 12 million
acres in Spanish and Mexican land grants they claim were stolen
after 1848.
   A lawsuit filed in U.S. Claims Court in Washington, D.C., last
month seeks at least $1.3 billion primarily for Texas land between
the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico at onetime recognized
the Nueces as its border with Texas, rather than the Rio Grande.
   At the center of the dispute are 433 land grants given by the
king of Spain or the Republic of Mexico, said Rocha.
   The Brownsville resident is president of the Alliance of
Descendants of Texas Land Grants. The lawsuit filed by Rocha's
group alleges that families illegally lost the land when it became
part of the United States after the signing of the 1848 Treaty of
Guadalupe-Hidalgo.
   Under the treaty following the Mexican War, Mexico surrendered
half its territory to the United States, including areas of Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona and California.
   Rocha said many families, including his, were driven off their
land in the following years. He said he is a descendant of Matias
Longoria, who received land grants totaling about 36,000 acres from
the king of Spain in 1767.
   ``The United States did not protect the rights of those people
who lived here,'' Rocha said. ``Some of them were cheated, some of
them were killed, some of them were sent back to Mexico any way
they could get them there. We feel that maybe it's time for the
United States to correct that.''
   U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Casner said she could
not comment on unresolved litigation.
   Oil and natural gas discoveries in south Texas this century
would have made the families wealthy, said Willard Holgate, an
attorney for the alliance.
   ``Had these people not been deprived of their property, I
believe they would be very influential economically, politically
and socially,'' he said.
   In addition to at least $614.4 million for the 686 alliance
members, the lawsuit seeks class action compensation of at least
$750 million for as many as 20,000 others.
   Holgate said the $1.3 billion figure was based on the land's
estimated value of $195 million in a 1923 treaty between the United
States and Mexico.
   The lawyer said he also will try to persuade Congress to pass
legislation compensating the land grant descendants.
   A lawsuit that land grant families filed against Mexico was
dismissed by a U.S. court in 1983 for lack of jurisdiction.

day Nikita Khrushchev stopped by their farm and showed them
Russians weren't ``evil nasty commies.''
   It was Sept. 23, 1959, when the Soviet premier made the corn
fields of Iowa a world stage for a show of warmth that marked the
beginning of a thaw in superpower relations.
   Gorbachev has scheduled a visit to Minnesota on June 3 after his
Washington summit with President Bush.
   Arms reductions will be on the agenda for those talks, but
U.S.-Soviet tensions today are small compared with the period of
Khrushchev's visit to Roswell and Elizabeth Garst's farm. In those
days, Americans were digging bomb shelters and schoolchildren
practiced taking cover in the classroom.
   Liz Garst was 8 when Khrushchev visited her grandfather's
2,500-acre farm. She remembers discussions among the town's 1,500
residents about how long it would take for radioactivity to drift
to Coon Rapids if a bomb fell on the Strategic Air Command base at
Omaha, Neb.
   But she found the Soviet leader ``kind of jolly. He smiled a
lot. He wasn't scary.'' Khrushchev's wife, Nina, was ``a very
motherly woman'' who was fluent in English, Ms. Garst said.
   ``These people were not evil nasty commies. They laughed and
smiled. They let you sit on their lap,'' Ms. Garst said. ``I'm glad
it's happening again.''
   Ms. Garst, now chairwoman of a local bank, vividly recalls the
excitement of the visit.
   A tomboy, she fought unsuccessfully with her mother for trying
to make her wear white anklets with a frilly pink party dress. She
remembers her brother and cousins asking Soviet dignitaries for the
medals they wore and getting ``maybe a dozen straight off their
chests.''
   It was hardly a cozy gathering, however, with armed guards, an
unruly press corps of 300 and a Soviet entourage of 80.
   But it was a visit filled with symbolism.
   At one point Khrushchev patted the bulging belly of 240-pound
Donald Watkins and said, ``That's what America is like,'' then
roared with laughter.
   The visit was ``a signal that relations were warming,'' said
Steven Hoch, a Russian historian at the University of Iowa. It
launched Soviet efforts to improve farm productivity, which is
still a problem: A dozen Soviet experts are living with Iowa farm
families in a month-long exchange to learn U.S. agricultural
techniques.
   Before the visit, Khrushchev's slogan to rally industrial growth
in the Soviet Union was ``reach and surpass America,'' and the
Soviet leader had declared, ``We will bury you.''
   Hoch said Khrushchev and his advisers were ``truly shocked'' by
the productivity of large American farms.
   Khrushchev returned to the Soviet Union obsessed with the idea
of growing corn for animal feed and for popcorn and corn bread,
Hoch said, but his experiments failed. Food supply problems were
key to Khrushchev's fall in 1964, and these difficulties continue
to plague the Soviet leadership.
   The Garst family business, which began selling seed for hybrid
corn to the Soviets in 1956, is now a subsidiary of the giant
London-based ICI and still is doing business with the Soviet Union.
In March it announced the sale of more than 7.5 million pounds of
seed corn to the Soviet Union, the biggest such sale in more than
10 years and enough to plant more than 500,000 acres.
   David Garst, 32, now vice president of Garst Seed Co., said his
parents always believed ``that if you can help make a man prosper
he's going to be happier and more friendly. A well-fed nation is
certainly less volatile.''

   An engineering society thinks it's time the
world arms itself against asteroids that might collide with Earth.
   Nuclear warheads, suggests the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, may be needed to protect the planet against
mountain-sized space boulders that might smash into the Earth at
46,000 miles an hour.
   ``We have the technology needed to detect and track such an
object and possibly to divert it from an impending impact,'' the
AIAA said. ``We would be derelict if we did nothing.''
   In a position paper, the society suggested that searches of the
heavens be increased, perhaps by spotting relatively inexpensive
telescopes around the globe. It also called for a study of ways to
``deflect or destroy, or significantly alter the orbits of,
asteroids predicted to impact the Earth.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle referred to the position paper and a
longstanding theory that asteroids could be captured and mined for
minerals when he addressed the AIAA's annual meeting earlier this
month.
   ``Those same asteroids which promise material riches can be a
threat as well,'' he said. ``In 1965, a small asteroid exploded
high over Canada with a force equivalent to an atomic bomb.
   ``It would certainly benefit all nations to know when such a
natural event might occur, warn those who could be affected and
maybe, some day, even affect whether or where such an event might
happen,'' Quayle said.
   Asteroids are rocky bodies that orbit the sun between Mars and
Jupiter. The ones that have been observed range in size from 579
miles in diameter down to about 700 feet.
   Some have struck Earth in the past. Only last year, an asteroid
bigger than an aircraft carrier and traveling at 46,000 mph passed
within 400,000 miles of the Earth _ a distance less than twice as
far as the moon.
   ``Such an object, if it struck the Earth today, could cause a
disaster of unprecedented proportions,'' the AIAA paper said.
``Although the probability of such an occurrence is very small, its
consequences _ i.e. the casualty rate _ could be enormous.''
   Johan Benson, the institute's administrator for public policy,
said, ``It has been speculated that a nuclear weapon could be
used'' to destroy or deflect an asteroid if it was discovered a
year or so before impact.
   Use of a missile would depend on the composition and size of the
asteroid, Benson said. ``It could destroy it, but if exploded
properly, it could simply propel it off into another orbit.''
   The AIAA suggested that an international agreement would be
needed for nuclear interception and said, ``This is a particularly
good time to consider an international effort led jointly by the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.''
   Another defense measure, Benson said, would be to ``soft-land''
a propulsion system on the asteroid and slowly push it into an
orbit that would miss Earth.
   Last year's asteroid was not discovered until it had passed. Dr.
Bevan French, a NASA scientist, estimated if it had collided with
Earth, the impact would have been equivalent to an explosion of
20,000 hydrogen bombs, creating a crater five to 10 miles in
diameter.
   If it had hit the northeast corridor of the U.S. or Los Angeles
or Tokyo, said AIAA, millions of people would have died instantly.
   A six-mile-diameter asteroid 65 million years ago is popularly
believed to have caused a global catastrophe that destroyed the
dinosaurs.
   ``Earth-orbit crossing asteroids clearly present a danger to the
Earth and its inhabitants,'' said the AIAA. ``Perhaps we have been
lucky: since 1908 there have been one direct hit, one atmospheric
entry and at least two near misses.''

<HEAD>Study Shows AIDS Virus Test May Miss Many Who Are Infected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests commonly used to check for the AIDS
virus may fail to detect many people who actually are infected, a
study suggested today.
   Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta tested the blood of
165 people who had tested negative for the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, and found that 30 actually were
infected with the virus.
   Dr. Tab Ansari, the Emory professor who supervised the study,
said Tuesday that his team used a new type of test to find HIV
antibodies in blood samples that the routine laboratory tests had
said were disease-free.
   ``All of the ones that they found positive, we found positive in
our assay,'' said Ansari. ``But in addition, there were quite a few
that were negative in their assay that were picked up as positive
in our assay.''
   Ansari said the experiment began with 165 blood serum samples
that were tested using ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
the AIDS test most commonly used in hospitals and clinics. The
samples then were additionally tested using the Western Blot assay,
a test routinely used to confirm the ELISA finding.
   All of the samples tested in this traditional way were found
negative for the HIV virus, according to the study, which was
distributed by the National Academy of Sciences.
   Meanwhile, unlabeled blood from the same samples, along with
blood specimens from healthy volunteers, were provided to Ansari
and his team. He said his team did not know which samples came from
a high-risk population _ mostly drug users _ and which came from
healthy volunteers.
   The specimens all were subjected to a test called the pokeweed
mitogen assay, a procedure that forces specialized cells in the
blood to expel antibodies into the blood serum. The serum then was
tested using the ELISA and Western Blot assays.
   Thirty, or 18 percent, of the samples were found to contain
antibodies to the HIV virus, an indication of infection. And each
of these 30 samples were previously found by the ELISA and Western
Blot tests to be free of virus antibodies.
   Ansari said the routine tests now commonly used will give
positive results only if HIV antibodies are detected in the blood
serum. He said the pokeweed mitogen assay shows that there may be
infected people who do not develop antibodies to the AIDS virus.
   ``For some reason there are blood cells that have the antibody,
but do not secrete it,'' said Ansari. This means, he said, the
ELISA and Western Blot tests would not be able to detect the
antibodies.
   Ansari said enough blood remained in 26 of the 30 test samples
to conduct an even more sensitive assay, the polymerase chain
reaction. The researcher said this final test confirmed the
findings of the pokeweed mitogen assay in 21 of the 26 samples
tested.
   A National Institutes of Health researcher, who asked not to be
named, said Ansari's study is ``interesting'' and confirms the
suggestions of other researchers ``that people can be latently
infected and not test positive for the virus.''
   The researcher said the study shows that there are still gaps of
understanding that must be filled to thoroughly understand how the
HIV virus causes infection.
   Ansari said his study should not be interpreted to mean that
blood for transfusion, which is tested with the ELISA assay, is
unsafe. He said all of the blood that tested positive in his study
came from people ``at very high risk for HIV'' who would be
excluded from donating blood for transfusion.
   The study is published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, which officials at the academy said were to be
distributed today.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Summit Lingo `Keeps Some Mystery in the
Marriage'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Summits generate a vocabulary of their own.
With budget, superpower, NATO and economic gatherings in the works,
it's helpful to know the language used by the major players.
   Here's a glossary of phrases for this season of summits:
   ``Keep your snorkel above the water level.'' This is President
Bush's counsel for riding out heated budget disputes _ like the
current one over taxes. ``Tomorrow there will be another tidal
wave,'' is his follow-up.
   ``No preconditions.'' This is the way the White House makes it
appear that the president is open to new taxes without actually
proposing any.
   ``The trap.'' This is what Democrats say they think Bush is
setting for them when he says ``no preconditions.''
   ``Listen to what I say and see what we do.'' That's the
president explaining to journalists how to read his lips on the
subject of taxes nowadays.
   ``We'll keep some mystery in the marriage.'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater uses this phrase to justify why
unpopular proposals floated at the budget summit may not be
announced publicly.
   Fitzwater uses the same expression for not divulging what
agreements Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may sign
when they meet in Washington in two weeks.
   ``Table.'' This word varies from summit to summit. In foreign
policy jargon, tabling a proposal means to formally offer it. But
in congressional lingo, a tabled measure is a dead one.
   In budget summitry, ``table'' is used in another way.
Negotiators like to talk about what's on the negotiating table
(supposedly everything) or what's off the table (supposedly
nothing). That suggests it must be an awfully sturdy table.
   ``Everything is on the table, but no one wants to pick up the
serving spoon,'' says Robert Reischauer, director of the
Congressional Budget Office.
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said after the
first budget meeting at the White House on Tuesday: ``There's
nothing on the table.''
   ``The Flat Earth Society.'' Members, according to Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., are ``those who say tax increases are
unnecessary.''
   ``Revenues.'' It's the word Democrats and Republicans alike use
when they really mean more taxes. ``Franklin Roosevelt called them
revenues. And if it's good enough for Franklin, it's good enough
for me,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   ``Process reform.'' That's what budget director Richard Darman
says when he's really talking about giving the president line-item
veto powers and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
   ``Feet up.'' That's how Bush characterized in advance his first
summit with Gorbachev. However, last December's shipboard meeting
in Malta turned out to be not quite so informal. In fact, Bush
presented a 17-point package of proposals.
   Fitzwater said the upcoming Bush-Gorbachev session, rather than
being a feet-up get-together, will be one ``in which they can
really roll up their sleeves.''
   The budget summit, meanwhile, ``is feet on the floor and hands
on the table,'' Fitzwater says.
   ``Initial.'' Lack of progress on arms control agreements could
leave Bush and Gorbachev with nothing to sign at their upcoming
summit, so when an agreement isn't quite ready to be signed it may
still be eligible to be ``initialed.''
   Then, the details can be filled in later. And even though Bush
says ``we're going to have to hustle'' to have something to even
initial, the agenda for the summit includes a 6 p.m. June 1
``signing ceremony for Soviet-U.S. documents.''
   What documents?
   The United States isn't sure at this time, says spokesman
Fitzwater. ``There's a lot of things that could be signed,'' he
adds.
   ``This goes for your horse, too.'' This is part of President
Bush's advice to Gorbachev not to worry about demonstrators at
home, like the ones who booed the Soviet leader at a May Day parade.
   Bush did not elaborate, perhaps wisely. But he suggested that
heckling was one of the ``fruits of democracy'' and that Gorbachev
should see some of the ``parades I go to around here.''
   In other words, Gorbachev might do well to keep his snorkel
above the water level.

   For the first time in two years, CBS is back
on top as the No. 1 network, retaking the lead during the critical
May ``sweeps.''
   CBS got help from the Sunday night TV movie ``Shattered
Dreams,'' starring Lindsay Wagner as the battered wife of a
Washington official.
   It finished seventh last week, the only CBS program to make the
top 10, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen
Co.
   CBS, which has languished in last place for most of the year,
had not finished first since June 19, 1988.
   Whether the network with new president Jeff Sagansky can sustain
a winning streak remains to be seen. But the win came at the right
moment, during one of the four ``sweeps'' periods whose ratings are
used to set advertising rates.
   The week before, the first-ever broadcast of the CBS pilot for
``I Love Lucy'' tied with ABC's ``Roseanne'' as the most-watched
show on television.
   NBC, usually No. 1, dropped to No. 2 last week with an average
rating of 11.5. CBS had an 11.7, ABC an 11. Each point represents
921,000 households.
   Despite NBC's fall from No. 1, half the top 10 programs were
repeats of NBC hit series: ``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Empty
Nest,'' ``A Different World'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   Back-to-back episodes of ABC's ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' finished first and third. ``Roseanne'' was No. 2.
   NBC's attempt to match the phenomenal success of ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' with its own program of amateur tapes failed
miserably. ``Do-It-Yourself TV,'' with Dick Clark as producer and
co-host, finished in 81st place.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 20.6; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 18.9;
``America's Funniest Home Videos II,'' ABC, 18.3; ``Cheers,'' NBC,
17.6; ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Empty Nest,'' both NBC, tied, 16.9;
``The CBS Sunday Movie `Shattered Dreams,''' CBS, 16.8; ``A
Different World,'' NBC, 16.3; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC, 16.2 and
The Golden Girls,'' NBC, 16.
   Peter Jennings and ABC won the network news wars with a 9.5
average. CBS and Dan Rather finished second with 8.7 and NBC and
Tom Brokaw were last with 8.

telescope.
   
   Scientific name: Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis.
   Also known as: Mount Graham red squirrel.
   Weight: About 8 ounces.
   Diet: Mostly pine cones from the Englemann spruce, Corkbark fir
and white fir trees.
   Population: About 180 are believed to remain.
   Habitat: Mount Graham, in the Pinaleno Mountains 110 miles
northeast of Tucson, Ariz., is their only known habitat. They have
lived on the mountaintop for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 years.

   A strike this week by 12,000 workers of the

the government-owned company said in a statement.
   The strike that began Monday is ``causing grave and perhaps
irreversible damage to Centromin Peru and is endangering its

Peru Mining Co. (Centromin).
   Mineral exports traditionally account for more than half the
foreign exchange earnings of Peru, a leading producer of silver and
copper.
   The workers are demanding a 137 percent increase in their wages,
which inflation has shrunk to about $5 per day. Centromin is
offering to raise salaries by 90 percent.
   Peru is in the midst of its worst economic crisis this century,
and annual inflation is running near 2,000 percent.

   Mayor Marion Barry's attorney wants to avoid
delaying the mayor's upcoming drug and perjury trial, but political
aides say lengthy court proceedings won't stop Barry from running
for re-election.
   After the mayor pleaded innocent on Tuesday to six new drug
charges in an amended indictment, defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy
said the extra counts could jeopardize the scheduled June 4 start
of the trial.
   ``We will not be deterred,'' Mundy said after the five-minute
hearing. ``We want to show the public and the court that we will
not drag our feet. ... It will not be the defense that stalls.''
   July 5 is the deadline for Barry to enter the Democratic
primary, and a delay in the trial would mean that his legal dilemma
would not be resolved by then. Barry has not officially announced
his re-election plans but has been making a series of
campaign-style appearances around the city in recent weeks.
   But a Barry political aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a prolonged trial won't affect the mayor's plans to seek a
fourth four-year term.
   ``The bias from the campaign is that, (we) just go ahead with
the campaign,'' said the aide. ``The feeling is, you just don't let
the other side cut off your options.''
   The aide, who stressed that meeting the July 5 deadline ``only
allows the mayor to keep his options open,'' said a re-election run
appears likely anyhow. ``We're getting very encouraging signs from
the community.''
   The new charges, returned by a grand jury last Thursday, accuse
Barry of five misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and one
misdemeanor count of conspiracy. The mayor took drugs as far back
as 1984, the new indictment alleges.
   Barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought Feb.
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and that he
possessed cocaine on five occasions. The new indictment includes
all 14 charges, three of them felony perjury counts.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he hopes to
start the trial on time, but Mundy complained during the hearing
that the government's refusal to turn over a list of witnesses
might hamper his preparation.
   Barry's lawyer complained that prosecutors on Monday provided
him only a set of photographs and telephone records.
   Outside the courtroom, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens refused to say
whether the photos were from additional surveillance of Barry or
snapshots provided by grand jury witnesses. Stephens said last week
the investigation of Barry was continuing.
   One of the drug-possession counts stems from Barry's arrest Jan.
18 in an FBI undercover sting operation that allegedly videotaped
the mayor smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel.
   The government is not required to disclose the names of
witnesses who will testify against a defendant, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Roberts said in the courtroom.
   Roberts said hotel records had been produced for the defense as
well as job applications. He did not elaborate.
   Jackson said the defense ``is entitled to know who alleged
co-conspirators are.'' He cautioned Roberts that becoming immersed
in disputes about turning over information to the defense would
``increase the likelihood'' of a postponement of the trial.
   Jackson said the defense's pre-trial motions on the new charges
will be due Monday and the government's responses next Thursday. A
hearing will be held May 25.
   Barry refused to talk about his legal situation with reporters
after the court appearance.

   Israel's army, citing enhanced Arab chemical
warfare capabilities, has stepped up plans to distribute gas masks
nationwide and has prepared television ads on how to use them.
   When the army first gave out masks on a trial basis in 1979, the
results showed the public did not take the threat seriously.
   Masks were used for painting cars or worn to masquerade parties.
Needles in the medical kits were used for dart games.
   ``In order to get public cooperation, there has to be a
perceived threat,'' said an Israeli major who briefed a reporter on
the program. Under standing regulations he could not be named.
   Today, Israelis appear to accept the possibility of a poison gas
attack as part of a new Middle East reality.
   Army commanders say Syria, Iraq, Egypt and possibly Libya have
chemical weapons, and they say Iraq is developing a biological
potential as well as long range missiles to deliver such weapons.
   The threat was brought home last month when Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein vowed ``to burn half of Israel with poison gas'' if
Israel attacked Iraq.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, the deputy chief of staff, subsequently
announced on government television an experimental distribution
program will be expanded so virtually every home will have a gas
mask.
   The program is expected to begin on a gradual basis later this
year. In the meantime, the army is producing a series of public
service announcements on how to obtain and use the gas masks.
   A videotape of one such commercial was obtained by The
Associated Press. A family is shown watching television when the
husband hears his army call-up code broadcast.
   His wife kisses him goodbye at the door and then collects the
children's identity cards. She heads to a storage depot to get the
equipment and meets a neighbor along the way.
   ``Do you think there will be enough masks?'' the neighbor asks.
   ``Yes, they'll be enough for everyone,'' answers the mother.
   A narrator said anyone showing an identity card will receive a
gas mask. Army officials concede this does not apply to the 1.7
million Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Palestinians in occupied lands, where a 29-month-old revolt
against Israeli rule is under way, are excluded because the army
says they will not be targeted by Arab states and are unlikely to
cooperate with Israeli civil defense authorities.
   The major said masks could be used by Palestinian activists as
protection against riot control tear gas used in confrontations
between soldiers and Palestinians.
   The spokesman stressed that the 800,000 Arabs with Israeli
citizenship as well as foreign residents and tourists would have
the same access to anti-gas equipment as the country's 3.5 million
Jews.
   Israelis are already getting adjusted to life with gas masks.
   Drills have been held for the half-million pupils in the
nation's 2,200 schools and gas masks have been distributed in 61 of
the schools. In the army, officers say that almost every major
exercise now involves anti-gas warfare.
   ``The world still underestimates this danger and allows
countries that develop and use such weapons to go unpunished,''
said Yitzhak Samuel, an insurance agent who lives in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Ramat Hasharon.
   Samuel, his wife Etti and their three children _ Inbal, 14, Roy,
11 and Shimrit, 6, _ received gas masks and medical kits 18 months
ago as part of an experimental program in two cities to test
whether Israelis would take care of the equipment.
   Each family member received a cardboard box with a mask, filter
and syringe. The needle contains an antidote and is injected into
the leg in case of exposure to poison gas.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Invites Raisa Gorbachev to Wellesley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The seniors at Wellesley College may get not
one, but two first ladies at their commencement.
   Barbara Bush said Tuesday night she has invited Raisa Gorbachev
to accompany her to the June 1 commencement at the Massachusetts
women's college, where some students have questioned whether Mrs.
Bush, a career homemaker, is a good role model.
   Mrs. Bush said she has invited Mrs. Gorbachev to accompany her
and ``if she wants to, I'd love to have her.''
   The first lady spoke with reporters Tuesday night at the state
dinner for Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
   Mrs. Bush laughed when asked if she had finalized her role in
the May 31-June 3 summit here between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``All my life I've lived with the myth that I make the
decisions. ... I don't make all the decisions that go on. I'm
waiting to hear what everyone's plans are,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush, who delivered the commencement address Monday at the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said she was not
worried about her Wellesley speech and had no plans to import any
special speechwriting help.
   ``We're all right on that,'' she said. ``I am going to give the
same speech at Wellesley that I'd give to the University of St.
Louis or the University of Pennsylvania or Cumberland Community
College.''
   She admitted she was ``a little nervous'' at the University of
Pennsylvania, but ``only because of 30,000 people outdoors.''
   But it ``was wonderful,'' she said. ``I will confess that Bill
Cosby walking in front of me didn't hurt me any.'' Cosby also
received an honorary Ph.D.
   Mrs. Bush proudly displayed one of the designer purses that was
among the nearly $27,000 in personal gifts she and the president
received last year. The tiny, ornate bag, designed by Judith Leiber
of New York, was in the shape of a well-stuffed puppy.
   Its gold and silver spangles snapped open to reveal a miniature
comb, mirror, a tiny sack with what Mrs. Bush called her ``mad
money'' and a ``cheat sheet'' to remind her of guests' names.
   She said she may as well enjoy the purse _ one of four valued at
$3,102 _ since ``I take the rap.''
   Afterwards, the Bushes and their guests repaired to the East
Room, where jazz pianist Harry Connick Jr. and his quartet
performed.

   The owners of a stranded
communications satellite are weighing an offer from NASA to launch
a shuttle rescue mission for at least $130 million.
   Intelsat's board of governors will determine the fate of the
satellite, orbiting uselessly 345 miles high, at a meeting next
month.
   ``One of the paramount issues to be addressed is the question of
cost,'' said Tony Trujillo, a spokesman for the Washington-based
not-for-profit consortium of 119 countries. It operates a global
communications satellite system.
   NASA payload manager William D. Green said Tuesday the space
agency will send up a shuttle in late 1991 or 1992 to rescue the
Intelsat VI satellite if Intelsat covers the cost, which could
exceed $130 million.
   ``It looks doable. It basically comes down to a decision on how
they feel about the costs versus the risks,'' Green said.
   The uninsured $157 million satellite, launched commercially
March 14, ended up some 22,000 miles lower than intended after
failing to separate properly from a Titan 3 rocket. Martin Marietta
Corp., which conducted the $272 million launch, blamed an
engineering design error in the rocket.
   Intelsat engineers, afraid the satellite would enter the
atmosphere and burn it, managed to boost it into its present
position, where it can remain for several years, Trujillo said.
   The 5-ton satellite was to have eventually replaced two older
Intelsat satellites over the Atlantic. During its 13-year lifetime,
it would have transmitted three TV channels and up to 120,000
telephone calls simultaneously.
   The amount of money that could be made on the satellite _ as yet
undetermined _ is ``something we have to factor into the
equation,'' Trujillo said.
   Intelsat didn't insure the satellite because the premiums were
too high and instead set aside money to cover a launch failure.
Trujillo said he did not know whether that undisclosed amount would
finance a shuttle mission.
   NASA can retrieve the Intelsat satellite and return it to Earth
for repair or have space-walking astronauts attach a rocket that
would boost it to its proper orbit 22,300 miles high. Intelsat
would prefer the latter option.
   Both options would involve the same degree of difficulty, Green
said.
   NASA has twice repaired satellites in space _ in 1984 and 1985 _
and brought back two other spacecraft aboard shuttle Discovery.
   Intelsat would pay only a portion of the cost if the shuttle
carried other payloads for deployment.
   Plans for launching an Intelsat satellite on the shuttle were
scuttled by the 1986 Challenger explosion, after which President
Reagan and Congress directed NASA to move away from the commercial
launch business.

<HEAD>Mexico Seen as Fast-Growing Market for U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico may be one of the fastest-growing
markets for U.S. wheat in the coming decade, says a new analysis by
the Agriculture Department.
   By the turn of the century, Mexico could be importing 2.2
million metric tons of wheat annually, triple the average of
700,000 tons during 1986-88, the department's Economic Research
Service said.
   ``The U.S. likely would capture most of the Mexican wheat
market, assuming the import demand is for food wheat,'' the report
said. ``Mexico has been one of the largest U.S. wheat markets in
Latin America, although trade volume has been erratic.''
   Analysts said the long-run import prospects are based on a
computer model reflecting Mexico's changes in economic policies,
forecasts of slower growth in domestic wheat production and an
expected recovery in the country's economy.
   Population growth and assumptions of world and domestic price
changes also are factors in the Mexican wheat outlook.
   The report in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine was
written by economist Myles J. Mielke of the USDA agency.
   ``Per capita wheat demand in Mexico declined during the 1980s,
largely in response to slow economic growth,'' the report said.
``Since 1982, the economy has been weakened by large public debt
payments, reduced petroleum revenues, rising inflation and interest
rates, falling real wages and high unemployment.''
   Government policies in the 1970s and early 1980s also limited
Mexican wheat imports to protect domestic producers. Since the
country's financial crisis in 1982, a series of reforms has been
undertaken.
   Import tariffs were ``dramatically reduced and other restricted
trade practices eliminated'' in 1986-87, the report said. However,
import license controls remained on wheat and some other
agricultural commodities.
   ``Mexico's gradual liberalization of trade and price policy is
expected to result in greater transmission of world commodity
prices into the domestic market,'' the report said. ``The
elimination of non-tariff barriers should eventually lower domestic
producer prices for wheat closer to world trading prices, which are
expected to continue their historic downward trend during the
1990s.''
   According to the report, Mexico's per capita wheat consumption
by the mid-1990s is expected to regain its peak of a decade earlier
and rise even further through 2000.
   Meanwhile, Mexico's growth in wheat production is expected to
undergo ``a significant slowdown'' in the 1990s, compared with the
last 20 years.
   ``With projected consumption growth outstripping production
gains, the results indicate a sharp rise in Mexican import demand
during 1990-2000,'' the report said.
   But the author added that the computer study assumes no abnormal
weather in projecting Mexico's wheat import needs and that in
reality ``weather-induced variations in production likely will make
annual import demand more unstable'' than projected.

   The Agriculture Department wants to hear from
the public about designing new food safety regulations for certain
refrigerated meat and poultry products.
   Products that would be covered by the regulations include
ready-to-eat, uncured, perishable meat and poultry items that are
packaged in a variety of sealed containers. The labels indicate the
food is ``perishable'' or carry instructions to ``keep
refrigerated.''
   Examples include soups, sauces, pastas, salads and entrees found
in refrigerated cases in delicatessens and grocery stores. Frozen
foods or those that consist entirely of cured meat or poultry are
not included.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Tuesday that consumer demand
for fresh convenience foods ``has greatly increased the variety of
these products on the market.''
   ``These products are perishable and if improperly processed or
handled, they may pose unique health risks to consumers,'' he said.
``We are asking for public comments, information, scientific data
and recommendations to help determine what additional regulations
are necessary to ensure the safety of these products.''
   Crawford said the new refrigerated food products differ greatly
from traditional meat and poultry. Although processed and packaged
to destroy or retard the growth of harmful organisms, they do not
receive the thermal heat processing that is used to kill all
bacteria in traditional canned goods.
   The agency is also reviewing recommendations made by an advisory
committee on microbiological criteria for foods on ways to ensure
the safety of refrigerated meat and poultry, he said.
   Comments can be sent by July 13 to: Policy Office, Attention:
Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, Room 3171-South, Food Safety and
Inspection Service, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

   Total production of red meat and poultry is
expected to rise about 2 percent this year, due entirely to greater
output of broilers and turkeys, according to Agriculture Department
economists.
   Red meat production is forecast to decline 1 percent from last
year, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday. But
broiler and turkey output is expected to gain 7 percent each.
   Beef production ``may increase slightly'' from 1989, the report
said. But commercial pork production will be down by about 2
percent because of poor returns to farmers last year.
   Retail beef prices may rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last
year, and pork prices may go up 9 percent to 13 percent, the report
said.
   Total egg production is expected to be up 1 percent from last
year, following ``positive returns'' in 1989 and early 1990, the
report said. Prices are declining as a result of the larger
production.

<HEAD>Gorbachev May Visit Think-Tank Set Up to Study `Evils' of
Communism</HEAD>

   The conservative think tank created to
do ideological battle with the Russian Revolution has extended a
welcome to Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The Soviet leader has announced a two-hour stop at Stanford
University on June 4, after his arms summit with President Bush and
visits to Minnesota and San Francisco.
   ``Your guess is as good as mine,'' university President Donald
Kennedy said when asked Tuesday why Gorbachev had scheduled the
visit.
   One attraction might be the Hoover Institute on War, Revolution
and Peace.
   The think tank on campus has thousands of revolution-era
documents, including secret Czarist police files. Among them is a
police album with a mug shot of Leon Trotsky.
   Hoover Director John Raisian said scholars there ``would welcome
any opportunity to exchange ideas about the monumental historical
events ongoing in the world.''
   Any visit to the Hoover Institution would be tinged with irony.
The institution was set up in 1919 by future president Herbert
Hoover to ``demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx.''
   Some of the Czarist files were smuggled to the institute in the
1920s, said Hoover associate director Charles Palm.
   The French government had been asked by the Soviets to see that
the documents from the Imperial Russian Embassy in Paris were
transferred to the new regime, he said. But ``an agent of the Czar
smuggled them out to us and then told the French the items had been
destroyed in a fire.''
   The agent stipulated that the secret of how the items got to
Stanford be kept from the public until his death in 1957, Palm said.
   Alexander Kerensky, premier of the provisional government
overthrown by the Bolsheviks in November 1917, came to work at the
Hoover Institute in 1955 and stayed for 11 years. He died in 1970.
   As late as 1959, Hoover wrote that the purpose of the facility
``must be, by its research and publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx _ whether communism, socialism,
economic materialism or atheism _ thus to protect the American way
of life from such ideologies, their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American system.''
   The institution generated many of the conservative ideas and
leaders of the Reagan years. Reagan is an honorary fellow, and
several of his advisers, including economist Martin Anderson,
former National Security Adviser Richard Allen and special envoy
Philip Habib, were among the more than 100 Hoover scholars.
   The institute's buildings, including the landmark Hoover Tower,
house a library of about 1.6 million volumes and archives
consisting of about 4,000 collections.
   Hoover warned in 1961 that ``the left-wing faculty in Stanford
University is constantly conspiring to get control'' of the
institution.
   Tension surfaced in the late 1980s when a drive was mounted by
Hoover scholars to put the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library at
Stanford. After protests on political and environmental grounds,
the plan was scrubbed.

<HEAD>A Simple Plan to Produce a Budget Surplus in Six Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He makes it seem simple. Just as President
Bush and congressional negotiators start grappling with the federal
deficit, Brookings Institution economist Charles L. Schultze is
offering his own plan.
   Cut defense spending in half, raise taxes and cut middle-class
entitlements, he says, and you can:
   _Replace the deficit with a $70 billion budget surplus by 1995.
   _Increase government spending by $15 billion a year for
non-military research and development, to keep America competitive;
by $6 billion ($150 per pupil) to spur states to adopt educational
reforms; by $4 billion for highway and airport reconstruction to
repair a deteriorating infrastructure. Also, health insurance could
be provided for the 30 million Americans who lack it, paying for it
through a 6 percent value added tax, essentially a national sales
tax.
   Schultze, who was chief economic adviser to President Carter,
outlined his proposal in ``Setting National Priorities,'' a
Brookings book whose appearance coincided with the start of White
House budget negotiations on Tuesday.
   In the report, Henry Aaron, another economist from the liberal
research organization, disputed Bush's assertion on Inauguration
Day that America must limit what it tries to do because ``we have
more will than wallet.''
   Asserted Aaron: ``The question is not whether America has enough
wallet, but whether it has the will to use its abundant wealth to
solve the problems that it faces. ... The United States is a nation
blessed with the highest per capita income. Its national product is
2{ times larger than that of the second-largest economy.''
   The book concedes that the country faces ``no imminent crises
that demand decisive leadership,'' but says it instead confronts a
more difficult challenge _ ``nagging problems whose solutions
require immediate and tangible sacrifice but offer deferred and
diffuse benefits.''
   Schultze's plan for converting deficit to surplus in six years
calls for cutting defense spending in half; cutting Social Security
benefits or taxing them like other retirement benefits; cutting
``middle class'' subsidies and increasing taxes by $67 billion _
the amount that could be raised by an 8.5 percent surcharge on
present personal and corporate income taxes.
   Those steps, along with the savings from reduced interest
payments on the national debt, would generate a $70 billion surplus
by 1995, he said.
   That compares to the $119 billion deficit in 1995 the
Congressional Budget Office projects under present policies.
   Schultze's candidates for spending cuts include disability
compensation to veterans with low disability ratings; subsidies for
merchant vessels and school lunches for middle-class children.
   He also would jettison NASA's manned space station (``a very
expensive way to get modest scientific benefits''), cut mass
transit capital grants and operating subsidies (they go ``for the
benefit of middle-class suburban commuters'') and eliminate Small
Business Administration loans except for minorities and disaster
victims.
   So far the nation has avoided disaster while running up 10
straight big deficits, each larger than 2 percent of the gross
national product, Schultze concedes.
   But, he says, ``That the nation can muddle through, sustaining
large budget deficits without a cyclical crisis, does not mean that
deficits do no harm and can be ignored. A successful economy ought
not only to avoid recession and inflation, but also to provide for
future growth.''
   Aaron agrees that, facing no military threat or economic crisis,
the United States can get by ``without absolute decline.''
   ``Yet Americans cannot escape the reality that decisions taken
during this decade will determine whether the chronicle of growth
at home and influence abroad continues or flags,'' he said.
   The budget impasse has led to a policy paralysis, says another
Brookings researcher, political scientist Thomas E. Mann.
   ``The most striking and unsettling feature of American
politics,'' says Mann, ``is the stark contrast between the
extraordinary pace and scope of change occurring outside the
country and the political immobilism within.''

   President Bush's personal worth is valued at
$2,352,500, most of it in a blind trust, and he has liabilities of
just $49,000, the White House says.
   In addition to the blind trust, Bush's principal asset is his
seaside home in Kennebunkport, Maine, which he valued at $892,000,
according to disclosure forms released Tuesday. However, other
estimates have put the value of the oceanside compound at more than
$3 million.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife Marilyn reported assets
ranging from at least $691,004 to $1,045,000 or more. The Quayles'
tax return, released last month, showed interest and dividend
income of $16,430, primarily from stock holdings in Central
Newspapers Inc., a publishing company owned by Quayle's family.
   The Quayles' only liability was the mortgage on their home in
McLean, Va., which they rent out while living in the vice
presidential residence. The mortgage was listed as between $100,001
to $250,000. They paid off a promissory note of less than $50,000
to Huntington Newspapers on Feb. 28, 1990.
   Regulations permit federal officials to list assets and
liabilities in ranges rather than precise dollars.
   The disclosure forms showed that both the Bushes and the Quayles
collected more than $20,000 in all kinds of personal gifts, from
cowboy boots, to evening bags to baseball cards.
   They must publicly disclose any gifts from a single source
valued at more than $100.
   Spokesmen for Bush and Quayle said many of the gifts were given
away to family and friends, such as the 11 pairs of boots a Texan
sent for the Bush grandchildren.
   Bush and his wife Barbara received at least $26,839 worth of
such personal gifts last year, including a $995 pair of cowboy
boots and a box of glass Christmas ornaments and tinsel from Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, the forms showed.
   Mrs. Bush received the most expensive gift listed on the report:
four evening bags valued at $3,102 from a New York designer, Judith
Leiber.
   First dog Millie got a gingerbread-style Christmas doghouse made
from dog biscuits that was valued at $100 from public relations
executive Robert Gray.
   The Quayles collected $23,014 in personal presents, including a
pair of hunting knives worth $2,750 from Gilbert Hibben of Hibben
Enterprises in Louisville, Ky.
   The disclosure form said Bush's blind trust grew in value in
1989 to $1.28 million from $998,000.
   In addition to the Kennebunkport home, the Bushes' assets not in
the blind trust were listed as: a lot in Houston valued at $81,000,
insurance policies with a cash value of $39,000, bank accounts
worth $32,000 and individual retirement accounts worth $32,500.
   The Bushes have no mortgage. Their only liabilities are three 5
percent loans totaling $49,000 against their life insurance
policies.
   Among their gifts: two neckties and a watch worth $300 from the
Aga Khan; a $455 sweater from designer Ralph Lauren; $466 worth of
golf shirts, caps, golf club and instructional videotapes from
golfer Lee Trevino; a sweatshirt, jogging shoes and tennis shoes
from tennis star Bjorn Bjorg worth $150; a $100 sterling silver box
from Italian President Francesco Cossiga.
   A $288 set of baseball cards came from Hall of Famer Stan Musial
and Edward Stack of Cooperstown, N.Y.; and three small tins of
caviar from Herbert S. Hoffman of Boston worth $255.
   The gifts to the Quayles included: $1,591 in Izod shorts and
slacks from Izod executive Charles J. Smith; a $750 Indianapolis
500 racing helmet from Bill Marvel, an official of the race; 10
pairs of No Excuses bluejeans worth $260; and $1,271 worth of golf
equipment from the Ben Hogan Co.
   Bush and Quayle do not have to pay taxes on the gifts they keep.
   They must turn over to the State Department all official gifts
worth more than $180 from foreigners, except personal presents from
foreign friends.

<HEAD>State Officials Warn of Fraudulent Health Insurance Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A complex maze of federal and state laws
governing employer health insurance plans practically invites con
artists to prey on consumers, say state regulators who want
Congress to change the system.
   At a hearing Tuesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs
investigations subcommittee, the officials said con artists are
using a ``regulatory black hole'' to set up fraudulent plans and
leave thousands of Americans with unpaid medical bills.
   The panel is reviewing how the Labor Department and state
officials investigate abuse and fraud within such plans, known as
Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements, or MEWAs.
   The plans are normally used by small businesses with no other
affordable means of coverage for their workers.
   The federal law governing such health plans is murky because it
gives conflicting responsibilities to state and federal
authorities, said Jo Ann Howard of the Texas State Board of
Insurance.
   ``It is far too easy for confidence men to hide behind (the
federal law) and exploit its complexities,'' she said. Fraudulent
operators are taking advantage ``of a regulatory black hole to
victimize the public,'' she added.
   Tom Gallagher, Florida state treasurer and insurance
commissioner, called on Congress to return complete control of
health care plans for small businesses to the states. He noted the
federal law governing such plans was primarily intended to regulate
pensions.
   ``For little firms, more effective regulations means one master,
not two. Designate one level of government to regulate these health
plans and you eliminate the con artists' ability to rely on deceit,
Ponzi schemes and false hopes of low cost,'' Gallagher said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., subcommittee chairman, said many of the
plans were ``nothing more than sophisticated pyramid schemes'' in
which the insurer's ability to pay claims depends on attracting
additional participants and premium dollars.
   Many of the plans are being ``looted by unscrupulous operators''
who use premium money to cover outrageous salaries, commissions,
personal expenses and entertainment, Nunn said.
   Several victims of such schemes also testified. Robert Wagner of
Whiteville, N.C., thought he and 50 co-workers at a furniture store
had health insurance coverage because they had been paying monthly
premiums.
   Wagner said he found out the plan was fraudulent after he
suffered a heart attack last year and was left with $12,000 in
medical bills _ roughly the amount of his annual take-home pay.
Now, he said, he can't find coverage for himself and his two
daughters.
   David Ball, an assistant labor secretary who oversees the
federal enforcement of pension and welfare benefits, said no one
had an accurate picture of the scope of the problem.
   He noted that Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole recently endorsed
legislation to require the operators of such plans to register with
the government and that she had asked Congress for 130 additional
enforcement officers to watch over pension and welfare programs.

   Four Texans drew sentences ranging
from probation to 18 months in prison in the deaths of five illegal
aliens asphyxiated inside a fumigated railroad car.
   The defendants had been indicted on alien smuggling charges but
pleaded guilty to lesser offenses in a plea bargain.
   The victims, five people from Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador,
died in October after being locked inside a trailer filled with
tortilla flour. The flour had been fumigated with Phostoxin, an
insecticide deadly to humans.
   Under questioning Tuesday from U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela,
Assistant U.S. Attorney John G. Crews said he had no proof the
defendants actually put the aliens in the trailer.
   After the sentencing, the prosecutor said a fifth person, a
Houston resident who cannot be found, is believed to have locked
the aliens in.
   The judge sentenced Magdaleno Arcos Soriano, 34, to 18 months in
prison, to be served after a 14-month sentence imposed in November
in another alien smuggling case.
   Eleutorio Amaya Torres, 35, who received probation in the
previous case, received a 16-month sentence Tuesday. Amaya's wife,
Jane Amaya, 39, was sentenced to six months. Mary Ann Martinez, 24,
got three years' probation.
   Ms. Martinez had pleaded guilty to misprision, or concealing
knowledge of a crime. Amaya and Arcos Soriano pleaded guilty to
witness tampering. Mrs. Amaya pleaded guilty to conspiring to
smuggle aliens.

<TEXT>
   Villagers waved, danced and shouted
support for rebels who drove reporters deep inside Liberia to show
their nearly 5-month-old war against President Samuel Doe is still
going strong.
   Western journalists were escorted on a 20-hour drive Sunday and
Monday through three of the country's 13 counties _ including the
country's breadbasket and major mining center _ to disprove Doe's
claims his troops control the entire West African nation.
   Survivors of recent fighting said government troops massacred at
least 32 people before fleeing advancing rebel troops, and they
showed reporters a pile of 15 bodies Monday. They said dozens of
people were wounded by the government troops and it was likely
other bodies were dumped in the bush.
   When rebel leader Charles Taylor drove into Tapeta with the
13-vehicle convoy carrying reporters, scores of civilians waved
palm fronds and welcomed him as a savior.
   ``Our leader, Mr. Taylor!'' they chanted at the convoy, which
was protected by 200 armed rebels and an aging anti-aircraft gun as
it entered the town 120 miles north of the capital Monrovia.
   Since Taylor's forces invaded Dec. 24 from the Ivory Coast, more
than 350,000 people are estimated to have fled the fighting, more
than half of them going into neighboring Ivory Coast or Guinea.
   Taylor's promises to end corruption echoed those made by Doe 10
years ago when he took power in a bloody coup, seizing control of
the country from descendants of the former American slaves who had
founded it in 1848.
   Taylor says he plans to install a transitional government and
sees no role for opposition parties that have been harassed by Doe,
until he decides to have elections. He said that transitional
period could last from 3 to 5 years.
   He said the United States, which has been the main source of
foreign aid for Liberia, would continue to have a close
relationship after he took power. He added he would encourage
investment, particularly by Western companies.
   International human rights organizations accuse Doe's troops of
slaughtering hundreds of civilians, particularly members of the Gio
or Mano tribes, Taylor's tribal base. The U.S. Congress has passed
a resolution condeming Doe.
   In the village of Saithom, survivor Elizabeth Kpue said Doe's
soldiers had rounded up people, including children, and shot them
before fleeing the advancing rebels April 9.
   ``They just shot her. My little girl. She was only 4,'' the
27-year-old woman said.
   Survivors were interviewed in a hospital on the Liberian
Agricultural Co. rubber plantation, owned by an American company.
   Taylor's men appeared to be better-disciplined than Doe's and
clearly controlled the areas shown reporters.
   No vehicles were seen except those driven by rebels. Crude
roadblocks of rope with a red triangular-shaped flag that the
rebels used were manned by villagers armed with shotguns.
   Reporters were met by a representative of Taylor inside Ivory
Coast on Sunday and escorted to a dense forest path and across St.
John's River into Liberia. They were driven Monday for almost five
hours on the main road to within 30 miles of Buchanan, the main
Atlantic Ocean port.
   In Tapeta, the reporters were housed at a Baptist mission whose
American missionaries fled when rebels entered the town March 26.
   Taylor, who said he was a pro-U.S. ``diehard capitalist,'' urged
reporters to publish a warning to civilians of Monrovia to evacuate
the capital before his men invade. He said he had held off
attacking Buchanan and Monrovia to save civilian lives.
   Doe also has said he has held off attacking Taylor's strongholds
because he wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.
   Both men have refused to negotiate with each other.
   Taylor denied claims his forces had been trained and equipped by
Libya, saying the Soviet bloc assault rifles and other weapons they
carried were captured from government troops who ``drop their arms
and run whenever a shot is fired.''
   Reports from witnesses of several battles support Taylor's
claim. Some witnesses said the government troops quickly ran out of
ammunition whenever combat began.

<HEAD>Brothel Owner Challenges Tax Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leather-clad brothel owner went to court _
brandishing handcuffs and a cat-o'-nine-tails whip _ to challenge a
British claim for more than $98,000 in back taxes for her services.
   Marion Aken contended before three bewigged Court of Appeals
judges on Tuesday that since brothels were illegal, she cannot be
taxed.
   Andrew Thornhill, representing the government tax agency Inland
Revenue, argued that prostitution involved the provision of
services and was therefore taxable.
   No decision was made Tuesday in the case, which continues today.
   Her case came to the attention of the Inland Revenue in 1979
when she incorporated her brothel business, declared to be
``carrying on the business of prostitution.''
   This registration was later invalidated by the High Court as
being for an unlawful purpose, said her attorney, Ian MacDonald.
She therefore should not pay the 98,750 in back taxes, he argued.
   Thornhill argued robbers, drug dealers and other people engaged
in illegal activities are liable for taxes and Ms. Aken should be
too.
   Ms. Aken, who told the court her age was ``anything between 28
and 45,'' continues to work as a prostitute, which is not illegal
under British law provided a person does noy solicit on the street.
   Brothels, however, are illegal.

<HEAD>Irish Anglicans Vote to Ordain Women Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 12 years of debate, leaders of
Ireland's Anglican Church voted overwhelmingly in favor of
ordaining women priests.
   The clergy and laity gave their approval in separate votes in
the church's General Synod session in Dublin on Tuesday. The motion
must be approved by the whole synod Thursday.
   The measure requires a two-thirds majority but seems certain to
succeed as that margin was secured in each of Tuesday's votes.
   The clergy voted 129-59 and the laity 242-61 on a recommendation
made by last year's synod. The figures were announced by the
church's leader, Archbishop of Armagh Robert Eames, Primate of All
Ireland.
   The Church of Ireland has a total of 410,000 members in the
Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where most
of the Anglicans live.
   The Roman Catholic church strongly rejects women priests and
accounts for 70 percent of the 4.8 million citizens of both
sections of Ireland, according to Anglican statisticians.
   About 1,000 women have been ordained to the Anglican priesthood
mostly in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.
   The Church of England, mother church of the world's 70 million
Anglicans, still refuses to ordain women as do Anglican churches in
Wales and Scotland.
   Church of Ireland officials said it probably will be many months
before women become priests. There are currently six women deacons
and four others in training.
   Deacon Ginnie Kennerley said after the vote: ``I just hope we
can continue with it calmly, peacefuly and prayerfully and without
too much hurt on either side.''
   The Rev. John Paterson, Dean of Christ Church, Dublin, who
opposes women priests, commented: ``Some priests might feel they
would want to leave the Church of Ireland altogether and perhaps go
to the Church of England. Others might feel they just have to
withdraw to their parishes.''
   Paterson said the consequence of ordaining women would be the
adoption of a radical feminist attitude which would drive away
members and weaken the influence of the Anglican church as a bridge
between different religious communities.

<HEAD>Protester Nails Himself To Door At House Of Commons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man protesting poor health care nailed himself
by the hand to a door at the House of Commons, a spokesman at
Westminster Hospital said today.
   The man used a hammer to drive a six-inch nail through the palm
of his hand into an outside wooden door leading to St. Stephen's
Tower, which houses the famous Big Ben clock, the hospital
spokesman said.
   He spent about 20 minutes pinned to the door Tuesday until
firefighters freed him by cutting the nail, said the spokesman, who
in accordance with British practice declined to be named.
   The man, identified as 43-year-old Michael Peggie, was taken to
nearby Westminster Hospital, where the rest of the nail was removed
from his hand, the spokesman said. No bones were broken and he was
in satifactory condition today, the hospital said.
   News reports said Peggie, from Sunderland in northeast Englnd,
apparently intended his action as a protest against his treatment
by his local health authority.
   Andrew Gibson, district general manager of Sunderland Health
Authority, said Peggie had been treated by the authority and had
registered a complaint.
   Gibson did not disclose the nature of Peggie's treatment or the
complaint, and he did not say what action was taken because of the
grievance.
   Legislator Chris Mullin, who represents the Sunderland South
parliamentary constituency in the Commons, told reporters that
Peggie had sought his help against the health agency.
   Mullin said he put Peggie in touch with a medical professional
body to investigate his complaint.

<HEAD>`Miss Daisy' Says Oscar Movie Started With Endowed Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jessica Tandy, one of several artists
supporting government financial support for the arts, says the
movie for which she won an academy award this year owes a debt to
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   The 80-year-old performer, winner of the best actress award for
her lead role in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' told a congressional panel
Tuesday that the movie was based on a 1987 play that had received
money from the endowment.
   The endowment has come under close scrutiny since last year when
conservative lawmakers pointed out that a few exhibits receiving
NEA funds contained art that many would consider objectionable,
sacrilegious or obscene.
   The most outspoken criticism of efforts to put conditions on NEA
funding came from theater producer Joseph Papp, who this year
refused a $50,000 grant because of restrictions placed on funding.
   Papp referred to the congressional critics of NEA as ``jackals
and hyenas'' ready to pounce upon an endowment that was weakened by
constant underfunding during the Reagan administration.
   This year's appropriation for the NEA requires that art grants
be reviewed for possibly objectionable content.
   The subcommittee that heard from Papp, Miss Tandy and several
other artists is conducting hearings on a request for $175 million
in fiscal 1991 for the NEA.

<HEAD>Federal Study Shows Flour Mill Workers At Higher Risk For Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand flour mill employees who
worked with grain pesticides 25 years or more were nine times more
likely to get cancer than grain workers not exposed to the
chemicals, a new study says.
   Examination of health records of more than 22,000 workers by the
National Cancer Institute found they were at sharply increased risk
of developing leukemia, pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   ``We have a suspicion that it is a result of pesticide exposure,
but that isn't proven yet,'' Michael C. R. Alavanja, an NCI
researcher who supervised the study, said Tuesday.
   Results of the work were reported in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute issue dated today.
   Alavanja said flour mill workers were twice as likely to have
applied pesticides than were workers in other portions of the grain
processing industry, and that the excess numbers of cancer deaths
``appears most striking among flour mill employees.''
   Alavanja said that in the last 40 years a variety of chemicals
has been used at different times to control insects that infest the
nation's stored grains. In the 1940s and 1950s, the industry
commonly used DDT and hydrogen cyanide. Carbon tetrachloride, a
known cause of cancer, was used until it was banned in 1985.
Phosphine gas is now the most commonly use fumigant.
   The researcher said he had no evidence of any increased cancer
risk for people eating bread or other products made from flour
produced in mills where pesticides are used.
   Alavanja said that in a direct comparison with all other
segments of the grain industry without regard to length of service,
flour mill workers were four times more likely to die of
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Flour mill
workers were twice as likely to die of pancreatic cancer, and had a
slightly increased chance of deeloping leukemia, he said.
   Cancer risks increased with the length of the career in the
milling industry.
   ``When a comparison was made with other workers in the grain
industry ... the relative risk rose to more than ninefold after 25
years,'' Alavanja said in the study.

   A ``glitch'' waylaid Joan ``Jody'' Carson's
efforts to get more money from former husband Johnny Carson.
   Mrs. Carson, who married the comic in 1949 and was divorced from
him in 1963, was trying to obtain $120,000 a year from Carson in
court Tuesday. She said she cannot live on money he provides her
under a 1970 agreement.
   But Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob noted that Mrs. Carson, mother
of Carson's three sons, was married to ad executive Donald Buckley
for about six years after she divorced the ``Tonight'' show host.
   Mrs. Carson married Buckley 15 days after signing the 1970
agreement that gives her $13,500 a year until 1999 whether she
remarried or not.
   The judge asked Mrs. Carson's lawyer whether support ``should
survive remarriage.''
   ``She was remarrying three weeks later. It's a little glitch in
the case,'' the judge said.
   Lawyer Raoul Felder never answered the question, and the judge
reserved decision.

   Mike Wallace says he was treated for depression
and thought about suicide during the Westmoreland libel trial five
years ago.
   In an interview that aired Tuesday on WNYW-TV, the CBS
correspondent said he kept the treatment a secret from his
colleagues.
   ``Depression is something you do not want to talk about,'' the
71-year-old Wallace said. ``The reason I'm talking about it now is
so people who are looking in will be aware of the kind of thing
that can happen. It is a sickness.''
   Asked if he thought about suicide, Wallace responded, ``Sure.''
But he said he never made plans to take his life.
   Wallace was a co-defendant in Gen. William Westmoreland's 1985
libel suit against CBS for reporting that the general deliberately
falsified estimates of enemy troop strength during the Vietnam War.
   Westmoreland settled out of court.

Mitchelson saw a man stricken in a courtroom and resuscitated him.
   ``I looked at him, and frankly it looked like he was gone,''
Mitchelson said Tuesday of the man, accountant David Atkins.
   ``I just tried the best I could and gave him CPR for four or
five minutes. Finally, his eyes fluttered, there was some movement
and he regained consciousness.''
   Atkins, 60, was treated at a hospital and released, said his

   Mitchelson became well known in the palimony case of Michelle

   Since it was set free into space from the space shuttle

   The first photograph from the telescope had been expected a week

engineers are talking cautiously of capturing the first image on

The antitrust division requirement ``offends the Fourth

   The Pentagon's inspector general has
recommended that an Army private allegedly mistreated by his
superiors over a missing rifle receive an honorable discharge.
   Inspector General Susan Crawford wrote Rep. Helen Bentley,
R-Md., that Pvt. James Griffin III ``was the victim of a ruse
designed by Army officers to extract information from him regarding
his missing weapon.''
   The congresswoman released the letter on Tuesday. The Griffin
case was the subject of a recent report on CBS' ``60 Minutes''
television program.
   Griffin was serving in Honduras last March when he was charged
with loss of his rifle. He contended the rifle had been stolen, but
his superiors turned him over to Honduran authorities for
interrogation.
   He was released 18 hours later and eventually returned to Fort
Bragg, N.C., where he was thrown out of the Army with a less than
honorable discharge, the congresswoman said.
   The Army Criminal Investigation Command later searched a private
house in Fayetteville, N.C., and found the receiver part of
Griffin's rifle along with a cache of 16 other semiautomatic rifles.
   The weapons were part of a cache from a man who had been a
soldier in Honduras with the task force at the same time Griffin
was there, she said.
   ``It is accepted by all that Private Griffin was treated

   A Boston lawyer and a parents' group is asking
a federal court to force federal health officials to publicize a
compensation program for vaccine-related injuries.
   Attorney Michael Hugo and Dissatisfied Parents Together, a group
of parents whose children have been injured or killed by vaccines,
say the federal government has failed to get word of the program to
other parents.
   Hugo, a Boston lawyer who represents people injured by vaccines,
and the parents' group asked the U.S. District Court to order the
Department of Health and Human Services to put out information
about the program in public service announcements to television and
radio stations, in fliers mailed with Social Security notices and
in ads in major newspapers.
   Of particular concern is an Oct. 1 deadline for claims to be
filed for children injured by vaccinations before Oct. 1, 1988.
   But Robert Harmon, head of the Health Resources and Services
Administration, the arm of the department overseeing the program,
said, ``We feel that reasonable efforts to publicize the program
have occurred.''
   Harmon said officials have conducted press interviews, printed
articles in the Health Resources and Services Administration's
weekly newsletter, notified national and all state bar associations
and sent information to professional organizations, journals and
newsletters.
   Also, the agency plans to have a toll-free hotline working by

   As the Goddess of Democracy radio ship
struggles to broadcast to China, a small army of Taiwanese is
visiting that Communist nation to distribute prizes to listeners of
another pro-democracy station.
   The recipients of the lottery prizes are among the many Chinese,
from university professors to housewives, who have been turning
their dials to a Taiwan radio station that began sending its
broadcasts to China a year ago.
   Just days after China's military crushed the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing last June, the ruling Nationalist Party of
Taiwan began beaming its local news programming to the mainland as
an alternative to the Communist propaganda flooding the official
air waves.
   The strategy represented a dramatic departure from four decades.
Military-run broadcasts to China had consisted mainly of vitriolic
attacks on the ``Communist bandits'' in Beijing and instructions
for air force pilots to defect across the Taiwan Straits in their
MiG jets.
   ``It's a soft sell of our way of life to China as opposed to the
previous hard sell of ideological propaganda,'' said John Feng of
the Nationalist-owned Broadcasting Corp. of China.
   The Goddess of Democracy is to begin broadcasting Friday but the
schedule may change because of difficulties it is encountering in
Taiwan, where it stopped for supplies before it sails for
international waters.
   The Taiwan government, seeking to avoid hurting relations with
Beijing, has voiced opposition to the project sponsored by a
coalition of press organizations headed by the French magazine
Actuel.
   While China has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
Goddess of Democracy, the Taiwan broadcasts have not been jammed.
They can be heard clearly in Beijing more than 1,000 miles to the
north.
   Feng said the news broadcasts can be heard by up to 80 percent
of China's people, but it wasn't until the station ran a lottery
for its Chinese listeners that the popularity of the programs
became clear.
   The station received more than 7,000 letters from mainland China
in less than two months after offering nearly 100 prizes _
including, a motorcyle, color TV, microwave oven and refrigerator _
to listeners who could correctly identify the Chinese zodiac sign
for 1990, the Year of the Horse.
   Many of the letters came from Chinese who described themselves
as devoted fans of the all-news station. Some named favorite radio
reporters while others offered opinions on the programming. Taipei
traffic reports were big hits; market reports were not.
   ``The program we hate the most is ``Stock Market Report,'' wrote
Miss Xiao from coastal Jiangxi province. ``We don't understand what
a 'stock market' is.''
   The drawing was held in January on Chinese New Year's in Taipei
and the winners were notified by letter. A student in Beijing won
the grand prize of a motorcycle.
   Since the station was wary of sending the prizes to China
through the mail, it held a second contest for its Taiwan listeners
in which the winners received a free trip to the Chinese mainland
to deliver the prizes. They are traveling this month.
   The station, broadcast to China on three short-wave and one
medium-wave channel, provides coverage of local Taiwan news
(although skimping on details of anti-government protests) as well
as international developments such as the fall of communism in
Eastern Europe.
   ``I don't think our program is that provocative,'' said Feng in
explanation. ``Of course, we want the democratization of China .. .
but we really don't want to antagonize China.''
   Still, the broadcasts clearly are giving the Chinese people
information about the world that Beijing would prefer they not hear.
   A listener surnamed Ren from the northern port of Tianjin in
China wrote to the station: ``Your broadcasts have given me a new
understanding of the world and the meaning of the word democracy.''
   Mr. Pan, a faithful Beijing listener, said: ``I feel that under
the current news blockade on the Chinese mainland, your station
provides us with a very good channel to understand what's happening
outside.''
   Organizers of the Goddess of Democracy radio ship also want to
promote democracy in China through their broadcasts, but say they
will play a role different from that of the Taiwan station.
   The 1,200-ton ship is ``not the voice of any authorities or of
any government,'' said organizer Christophe Nick. ``It is the voice
of the free press from all over the world.''
   The ship was planning to leave for international waters
Thursday, but it will find out later today if those plans must be
changed because of delays in customs. Taiwan has refused to allow
the ship to return to a Taiwanese port after broadcasts to take on
supplies.
   The Chinese Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to communist forces, still claim China and
remain technically at war with Beijing although they have lately
been trying to improve unofficial ties.
   Their stated goal is to one day return to the Chinese mainland
to again govern the country of 1.1 billion people.

   Vincent van Gogh's melancholy portrait of the
doctor who treated him in the weeks before his suicide sold at
auction for $82.5 million, making it by far the most expensive
painting in the world.
   The sale Tuesday of ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' came after a
10-minute bidding war at Christie's auction house between two
buyers who jacked up the price in increments of $1 million.
   The 26-by-22.5-inch oil was worth $141,000 per square inch to
Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo, which has emerged in recent years as a
major buyer of Impressionist art.
   The total surpassed the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's
``Irises'' in 1987 at Sotheby's, said Susan Britman, a Christie's
spokeswoman.
   Explaining the astronomical price, Christie's President
Christopher Burge cited the painting's good condition, its
high-profile exhibitions in New York and the opinion among many
that it is one of van Gogh's five best paintings.
   ``We may have to wait another 10 years, another 20 years for a
picture of that importance,'' Burge said.
   Dealer Hideto Kobayashi told Japan's Kyodo News Service he
bought the painting on behalf of an unidentified Japanese company
that wanted the work at any price. ``They are extremely pleased,''
Kyodo quoted Kobayashi as saying.
   Owned by the trust of German-born banker Siegfried Kramarsky,
who died in 1961, ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' had hung since 1984 at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Christie's had expected it to fetch
between $40 million and $50 million.
   The painting was completed in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, six weeks
before the artist's suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a
practitioner of homeopathic medicine and a friend and physician to
other Impressionist painters, had tended to van Gogh in the final
weeks of his life.
   Gachet is shown slouched at a table, head resting on his hand.
In a letter to Paul Gauguin, van Gogh said he had painted Gachet
``with the heartbroken expression of our time'' and that it was
``not destined to be understood.''
   A slightly larger version with less detail and flatter colors
hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   The auction had been anticipated as a test of the strength of
the art market. Prices boomed in the mid- to late 1980s, but the
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the
sale of ``Irises'' had cast doubt on whether prices would continue
to rise.
   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond bought ``Irises'' largely with
money borrowed from Sotheby's. Bond's business empire became
swamped in debt after the stock market crash, and he was forced to
sell the painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty
Museum of Malibu, Calif., in March.
   On Tuesday, once the price on the van Gogh reached about $36
million, two bidders dropped out. The Kobayashi representative and
an anonymous private collector bidding by telephone began raising
the price quickly, Burge said.
   ``Two people were determined to have a great picture,'' Burge
said. ``A tremendous battle ensued between the bidders all the way
to the end.''
   The final price included a $7.5 million, or 10 percent, buyer's
fee that goes to Christie's.
   The losing bidder bought another van Gogh, a self-portrait
painted in Arles, France, in 1888, for $26.4 million, Burge said.
   The auction included other major works by Impressionist and
modern artists.
   Record prices were set for seven other artists, including $12.98
million for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's ``Girl with Fur'' and $9.9
million for Marc Chagall's ``Above the City.''
   The auction sold 57 of 81 works offered for a total of $269.4
million.

<HEAD>President Lee Said To Favor Talks With China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator today quoted President Lee
Teng-hui as saying he would be willing to talk to China on a
government-to-government basis to improve relations and work toward
reunification.
   Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun, likely to become the next prime
minister, today also supported such an initiative.
   ``What we have in fact is one country, two governments. This is
the reality,'' he said.
   The Nationalist Chinese government once ruled all of China but
was forced to retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Chinese Communists. It subsequently refused all official contact
with Beijing, claiming the communists are a rebel government.
   But both sides always have agreed that Taiwan and China
eventually should reunify.
   ``We can accept government-to-government talks under the
framework of one China,'' lawmaker Ting Shou-chung quoted Lee as
saying in a meeting Tuesday.
   ``I can participate if we have equal status. Otherwise the
Chinese Communists would consider Taiwan to be a local
government,'' Lee was quoted as saying.
   Such conditions may make such talks unlikely. Beijing has
refused to recognize the Nationalist government as an equal,
claiming that Taiwan is a renegade province.
   Lee's reported comments mark the first time the Nationalist
government has offered to hold official talks with its rivals.
   Ting said Lee was responding to a proposal made by Chinese Vice
Premier Wu Xueqian, who suggested to a group of visiting Taiwan
legislators last week that the Nationalists and Communists hold
talks at the party level.
   Lee also said talks could not be held until Beijing rules out
the use of force against Taiwan and stops trying to isolate the
Nationalists diplomatically.
   It is unclear if Lee is considering the formal recognition of
the Beijing government to make talks possible.
   On Tuesday, the Taiwan Cabinet said it wants to set up a mission
in Beijing to handle the growing trade across the Taiwan Straits
and allow China to have a similar office in Taipei. The proposal is
viewed as a way to facilitate semi-official contacts.
   Taiwan sanctions trade and investment in China if it is
channeled through companies in third countries. But many of the
island's large entrepreneurs want to directly set up factories in
China to utilize cheap labor and land.

   The dollar held steady against the yen Wednesday,
while share prices fell moderately for the second straight day.
   The dollar closed at 151.95 yen, up 0.65 yen from Tuesday's
close of 151.30 yen. After opening at 150.90 yen, the currency
ranged between 150.89 yen and 152.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 29.42
points, or 0.09 percent, closing at 31,967.62 points. The index
lost 45.61 points Tuesday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 87.79 points as of 3 p.m.,
down from Tuesday's close of 88.18. Their yield stood at 7 percent,
up from the previous day's 6.92 percent.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said
there was heavy buying and selling during morning trade and the
market had not yet established a firm direction for the dollar.
   Other dealers said market players were waiting for a series of
U.S. economic indicators this week, including the consumer price
index for April, due out later Wednesday in Washington, and March
trade data, due out Thursday. The figures are expected to provide
an indication of the direction of the U.S. economy and interest

<TEXT>
   The stigma of Love Canal hasn't
stopped people from signing up to buy homes at reduced prices at
the former chemical dump.
   About 200 people by Tuesday had signed a list for homes that
will go on the market in about six weeks, according to the Love
Canal Area Revitalization Agency.
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday pronounced 250
homes in what has become a symbol of the nation's toxic waste
problems safe to live in. They will be put up for sale over the
next three years.
   Among those signing up were former Love Canal residents who want
to return to the neighborhood they remember fondly.
   ``The canal went right through my backyard. As kids, we used to
go back in those fields, mow them down, play baseball,'' said Gail
McClinsey. ``I'm fine, and I have two children. They're fine. I
keep in touch with some of the friends I grew up with. They're
fine.''
   James E. Carr, the revitalization agency's planning director,
said drains have been installed to catch any leakage from chemicals
dumped here by the Hooker Chemical Co. in the 1940s and 1950s.
   ``They do testing all the time. There's a continual monitoring
going on,'' he said. ``Sure, I'd live here.''
   But Lois Gibbs, a former Love Canal housewife who became an
environmental activist, said she and her allies would sue to block
resettlement.
   She said the study on which the EPA ruled was flawed because
scientists compared soil and air samples from the Love Canal
neighborhood with samples from two other contaminated parts of the
city.
   Carr said the asking price for the homes will be between $40,000
and $60,000, about 20 percent less than the going price for similar
homes elsewhere in Niagara Falls.
   ``We are building in a certain stigma factor,'' he said. ``We
think that's around 10 percent. We are also building in a factor of
the neighborhood being largely vacant.''
   The government declared Love Canal a disaster area in the late
1970s after the dump began leaking PCBs, dioxin and other toxic
chemicals. About 2,500 people were evacuated, and nearly 1,100
homes, some built virtually on top of the dump, were left vacant.
   But Carr said the ``stigma factor'' was minor.
   ``A lot of people never believed (the danger) anyhow,'' he said.
``These are the people who are lined up on our list now.''

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke is to
undergo prostate surgery, and his office today said the Australian
leader does not have cancer.
   Hawke is to enter the hospital Thursday and is expected to spend
a week convalescing, officials said.
   Hawke, 60, in power since 1983 and re-elected six weeks ago to a
record fourth-straight term, said he had been advised the prostate
was benign and not cancerous.
   A cancer scare cropped up during campaigning but doctors later
advised that apart from the prostate problem his health was
excellent.
   Hawke said he would have to cancel a planned May 30-June 2 visit
to neighboring Papua New Guinea. He said Federal Treasurer Paul
Keating would take on his duties while he is hospitalized.
   The prostate gland is a partly muscular gland surrounding the
urethra at the base of the bladder in men.

   Susan Montgomery Williams kept the bubbles
blowing and the rhymes flowing until the jury burst her bubble.
   She called it a case of double bubble trouble.
   Williams was convicted Monday of disturbing the court by popping
her gum too loudly in a hallway. She was fined $150 and got a
warning from Commissioner Michael J. Feinberg not to chew gum in
the courthouse.
   ``I guess I just must have made a new law _ don't snap, crackle
or pop unless you want to stop a cop,'' Williams said.
   Williams, a 29-year-old housewife, won a place in the Guinness
Book of World Records in 1985 by blowing a 22-inch bubble. A
National Enquirer photographer was on hand to record the event at
her home.
   But in October, she was cited at an outdoor concert for popping
bubbles so loud they disturbed the performers. She said she did it
so her kids could find her.
   Waiting outside a courtroom for dismissal of that case, Williams
couldn't resist popping another one. That drew the attention of two
bailiffs, who contended the explosions sounded like .38-caliber
gunfire.
   ``I guess it's my double bubble trouble,'' Williams said.

<HEAD>Inquiry Ordered Into Report Of War Criminals In New Zealand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer
today ordered an investigation into claims that at least eight
alleged Nazi collaborators are hiding out in New Zealand.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles provided his
government with a list of suspects. It included a former police
chief in Lithuania accused of killing several hundred Jews in 1941
and a Lithuanian vigilante said to be responsible for the deaths of
140 Jews on July 29, 1941.
   Palmer did not disclose the names of the suspects but said an
inquiry would proceed.
   ``We are going to conduct this whole thing with vigor,'' Palmer
said. ``It is a very important matter.''
   Ephraim Zuroff, Israel director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
said the suspects were five Lithuanians, two Latvians and one Serb.
   Zuroff said all the individuals listed were ``involved in the
commission of murder.'' He also refused to give the names.
   The center's associate director, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, said he
did not know whether the suspects in New Zealand were still alive.
   So far, cross-checking of immigration data and war crimes
reports had allowed the center to trace about 900 people in
Commonwealth countries in recent years, he said.
   ``It's a slow progress, and there could very well be more names
in New Zealand,'' he said.
   New Zealand's external relations minister, Mike Moore, said he
will set up a inquiry by Monday.
   He said a priority was to stop a person guilty of war crimes
from slipping out the country while the investigation was under way.
   ``New Zealanders would be deeply offended if in the meantime
people slipped away. I've asked for advice on that. There is some
urgency,'' he said.
   Of the refugees who came to New Zealand just after World War II,
the vast majority were Nazi victims.
   ``If a few criminals smuggled themselves in, that's a tragedy
and that will be exposed,'' he said.

<HEAD>President Roh Seeks Trip to Japan Despite Diplomatic Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo will push ahead
with his scheduled visit to Japan, his office said today, despite
an escalating diplomatic row over Japan's apology for its colonial
rule of Korea.
   South Korea, however, may develop some retaliatory measures if
Japan rejects its demand for a clear-cut apology for wrongs
committed under Japan's 1910-45 rule, presidential spokesman Lee
Soo-jung said. He did not elaborate.
   Roh has been under public pressure to call off his trip next
week to Tokyo, following controversial remarks by Japanese
governing party leaders asking Japanese Emperor Akihito not to make
an open, strong apology. But Lee said the president would not
reconsider the three-day visit, beginning May 24.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Tuesday he plans to
apologize to Roh about the colonial rule but would not say whether
the emperor should.
   Elderly Koreans have staged daily protests outside the Japanese
Embassy to demand an apology and compensation for Japan's wartime
acts. The protesters, many related to Koreans who were killed
during World War II, have asked Roh to cancel his visit. During the
war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans as soldiers and
forced laborers.
   ``Japan, the war criminal, must apologize, compensate,'' a dozen
protesters shouted today during a sit-in outside the embassy, which
was guarded by riot troopers wearing helmets and carrying shields.
Police did not intervene.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
Hirohito had for Japan's wartime actions.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after Hirohito died in January
1989.
   Roh's trip had been delayed twice by issues involving the legal
status of some 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan. Japan agreed
early this month to provide greater legal protection for Koreans.

   Officials said today that Iraq has started
civil defense drills in its major cities to prepare citizens in
case of a nuclear or chemical attack by Israel.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
drills were ``useful for both the authorities and the population to
learn how to deal with such cases.'' But he would not discuss
details of the preparations.
   Residents in various cities said part of the drill included
moving to huge concrete shelters where they stay for hours until a
siren blows, signaling they are clear to leave.
   They were also given gas masks to wear.
   Others said they were moved outside towns in fast buses in an
exercise aimed at moving them from a site that would be hit by
nuclear or chemical weapons.
   President Saddam Hussein said in April that if Iraq was the
target of a nuclear attack by Israel he would unleash his country's
chemical weapons arsenal.
   Israel is distributing gas masks to its citizens in the wake of
the threat.
   Israel staged an air raid against an Iraqi nuclear facility in
June 1981, accusing Iraq of developing nuclear weapons. Iraq said
its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has voiced concern
that Israel will again attack to try to thwart Iraq's developing
weapons program.
   Israel has neither confirmed nor denied having nuclear weapons
but has said it would not be the first to introduce such weapons in
the Middle East.
   During the 1980-88 war with Iran, Iraq built huge concrete
shelters designed to withstand nuclear and chemical attacks. Iran
and Iraq slammed each other's capitals with scores of long-range
surface-to-surface missiles which killed hundreds of the civilian
population.

   Jose Lefebre, the Cuban-born artistic
director of the Royal Wallonia Ballet, has died after a long
undisclosed illness, the company said Wednesday. He was 54.
   He became artistic director in December 1980, and his most
successful productions included ``Carmina Burana,'' ``Le Sacre du
Printemps'' and ``Carmen.''
   Born in 1936 in Santiago de Cuba from Cuban-French parents,
Lefebre studied dance in New York in the 1950s under Martha Graham,
among others.
   In 1959, he came to Europe where he made a name for himself as a
member of Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the Twentieth Century in
Brussels where he danced during most of the 1960s.
   In 1967 he wrote ``Invitation to Jazz,'' his first choreography
for the Royal Ballet of Wallonia, based on music by jazz greats,
including Count Basie.
   Lefebre also wrote choreographies fr ballet companies in Cuba,
Mexico and Senegal. Recently, he was asked by Cuban government to
form a new ballet group in his native country.

   Tornados killed a child, injured at
least 14 others and damaged scores of buildings in northern and
western Oklahoma, authorities said.
   One twister, bearing winds of 100 mph, cut a mile-long swath in
Stillwater, hitting residential areas and the Oklahoma State
University campus. At least three other tornadoes touched down in
Oklahoma Tuesday night.
   A 4-year-old was killed in Stillwater as his mother drove to a
relative's home to take shelter, authorities said. Authorities said
the mother, who was cut, was unable to explain exactly what
happened when the storm overtook them.
   Damage was reported to six apartment complexes and other homes,
businesses and schools in this town of 40,000.
   About 40 units at a housing unit on the university campus was
reported damaged, and the storm tore part of the roof off the
physical education center.
   At least seven other people in Stillwater were treated for
injuries. The worst injury was a 75-year-old man who broke a hip.
   A twister hit the ground around midnight in Foyil, injuring at
least six people as it plowed across four miles of farmland.
   A tornado ripped off a roof near Kellyville in Oklahoma, and a
twister in western Oklahoma terrorized patrons and workers inside
an El Reno truck stop when it touched down near Interstate 40.
   With power lines down, residents of Stillwater and Foyil waited
for daylight today to reveal the extent of the damage.
   ``I'm going to go back tomorrow and see what happened,'' said
Stillwater resident Jean Annesley, who spent the night in a Red
Cross shelter after her home was hit. ``It's going to kill me. But
I'll survive it.''
   Mike Field stood in his yard and looked at the wreckage from a
school roof that littered the inside and outside of his heavily
damaged house. He and his family had made it to shelter.
   ``When we were driving back, I saw a lot of trees down and
thought that maybe the trees here in my front yard would be
damaged,'' Field said.
   ``We turned the corner, the first thing I saw was the roof gone.
My wife started crying. What are you going to do?''

   The bad-tempered, high-kicking African
ostrich can run at 60 mph, but that's not fast enough to escape a
group of breeders who see the world's largest bird as a nonstop
profit machine.
   The breeders say there is increasing demand for their feathers,
skin and high-protein, low-cholesterol meat.
   Along with ostrich meat's newfound popularity among stressed
executives and health nuts in Western industrialized nations, the
Japanese have taken to preparing it sushi-style and eating it raw,
says breeder Kevin Grant.
   Unlike its domestic relative, the chicken, the ostrich yields
red meat with a distinctive flavor. About 55 pounds of top quality
meat worth about $500 can be stripped from the average-size bird.
   But the 6-footer offers other values, says Grant, head of a
recently established organization representing about 40 Zimbabwe
breeders.
   Finely tooled ostrich skin cowboy boots fetch as much as $5,000
a pair in Texas. The leather industry in that state alone demands
94,000 15-foot-square skins a year.
   Not much else of the ostrich goes to waste, either. The
feathers, a symbol of justice in ancient Egypt and of wealth to
European royalty in the early 1900s, made a comeback in the French
haute couture of top fashion designer Christian Lacroix earlier
this year.
   Japan wants the feathers to dust its cars, and already Japanese
dealers have been sent to inspect Zimbabwe's fledgling ostrich
industry.
   According to Grant, an adult ostrich provides about three pounds
of feathers and, in all, meat, skin and other by-products account
for about 98 percent of its body weight.
   Scientists are even studying whether ostrich corneas are
compatible with the human eye.
   The flightless bird is not susceptible to tick-borne diseases or
traditional livestock ailments covered by international quarantine
and transportation laws on animal products.
   ``It makes good practical sense,'' Grant says.
   Neighboring South Africa is the world's biggest supplier of
ostrich products. Some ranchers in Texas and other parts of the
American southwest also are dabbling with the birds.
   Grant says the fertile ostrich's giant egg is far too valuable
to scramble for breakfast and, contrary to popular belief, the
ostrich does not bury its head in the sand.
   As well as that formidable kick, the bird's rapier-like toe can
cut a person from chest to groin in a single swipe.
   ``The risk of being kicked is part of the business,'' says
Grant. ``I have a gambler's heart and this could be a big money
spinner.''

<HEAD>20th Anniversary of Jackson State Slayings Passes Quietly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago, police opened fire on a
college dormitory and killed two students, linking Jackson State
with Kent State in the national consciousness of a war's bloodshed
brought home.
   But while the May 4, 1970 killings of four students at the Kent,
Ohio, university were marked this year by the inauguration of a
monument in a ceremony attended by thousands, the 20th anniversary
of the Jackson State shootings passed virtually unobserved.
   Classes here ended May 12, and the few staff and students on the
quiet, sunny university campus Tuesday went about their business,
evidently oblivious to the anniversary of the deaths of James Earl
Green and Phillip Gibbs.
   A small ceremony took place May 2, attended by about 300 people.
   School officials said turnout was light because classes weren't
dismissed that day, but some students admitted they knew little
about the barrage of gunfire aimed at a crowd outside a women's
dormitory.
   ``There wasn't much talk about (the shootings),'' said Tracie
Archie, a 20-year-old political science student, who stopped by to
view a black stone memorial to the slain students on Tuesday. ``My
mother told me about it.''
   At 12:05 a.m. on May 15, 1970, policemen opened fire on students
at Jackson State, then a college, during a protest of the Vietnam
war and civil rights issues. The FBI later found more than 275
bullet holes in the five-story Alexander Residence Center.
   Killed were Gibbs, a 21-year-old pre-law major, and 17-year-old
Green, a Jackson high school student walking through the campus on
his way home from work. A dozen other students were injured.
   ``It's a part of history that really, I think, was kept quiet,''
said Cass Parker, an assistant chemistry professor and former
student. ``But there are students who will never forget what
happened. There are some students that will never let it be
forgotten.''
   Students lost a lawsuit over the shootings in 1974; no one was
ever convicted of a crime for the shootings.
   The night Gibbs and Green were killed, 22 policemen in riot gear
advanced on the students milling outside the residence center.
   The voice on a bullhorn ordered the students to disperse. Police
said they heard a gunshot. Students said it was more likely a
bottle dropped on the pavement from a dorm window. Police opened
fire.
   The Jackson State students were protesting the Kent State
shootings, as well as the racial epithets shouted at them from cars
by white Jackson residents who drove through the mostly black
campus.
   After the shootings, a street was blocked off in front of the
Alexander Residence Center and converted to a pedestrian mall,
called Gibbs-Green Plaza.

   The Simon Wiesenthal Center inadvertently
invited Frederic Malek, who once compiled a list of Jewish
officials for President Nixon, to help chair an event commemorating
the Holocaust.
   Malek, the president of Northwest Airlines, resigned from George
Bush's presidential campaign in September 1988 after it became
known that he compiled the 1971 list for Nixon, who Malek said
thought a ``Jewish cabal'' was trying to undercut his economic
record.
   A spokeswoman for the Wiesenthal Center said the organization
contacted every major American corporation and asked for the
participation of their top executive to serve as a co-chairman for
the June 6 dinner to honor journalists who covered the Holocaust.
   ``Had we realized Frederic Malek was president of Northwest
Airlines, the invitation to serve as a vice chairman would not have
been extended,'' said Rhonda Barad, the group's Eastern regional
director.
   Malek accepted the offer, however, and his name appears on
invitations to the $500-a-plate dinner.
   Now, ``if Mr. Malek wants to come he is more than welcome,''
said Barad. ``He might find it to be a very moving and educational
experience.''
   Malek has insisted to numerous Jewish groups that he is not
anti-Semitic. He said he was under intense pressure from Nixon to
deliver the list of officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, But Dive Expected; Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly in European trading today
but was expected to fall later in the day after the release of U.S.
consumer price figures. Gold fell slightly.
   The U.S. consumer price index to be released later today was
expected to show consumer prices up 0.3 percent in April after
rising 0.5 percent in March. This would indicate falling
inflationary pressures and increase the chances of lower U.S.
interest rates.
   The index is seen in some quarters as one of the most
influential U.S. indicators. But dealers were not certain whether
this month's figures would trigger a dollar move. Instead, traders
may wait for the release of the latest U.S. trade figures on
Thursday.
   ``A lot of recent figures have been disregarded by the market,''
said Paul Darmody, senior dealer at Nikko Bank Ltd. in London. He
said the market seems to be pegging currency movement on a
particular event with hindsight rather than reacting at the time.
   But John Blackley, chief dealer at the Bank of Scotland, said
the consumer data could provide just the excuse investors are
seeking to sell the dollar.
   Gold rallied in New York early Tuesday but then fell later in
the day. The decline continued in Far East trading early today.
   One dealer said the decline was a combination of normal
corrective reaction to the rally and a bout of Japanese selling. He
said that although New York had driven the price higher on
expectations of Japanese buying, Japan had sold the precious metal.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.65 yen to a closing 151.95 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 151.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.6510 West German marks, up from 1.6467
   _ 1.4027 Swiss francs, up from 1.3977
   _ 5.5687 French francs, up from 5.5480
   _ 1.8580 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8476
   _ 1,214.00 Italian lire, up from 1,210.50
   _ 1.1755 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1808
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6747, compared with $1.6775 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $369.45 an ounce, down
from $371.00 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $370.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $369.45, up from $367.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.45 to close at a bid $370.81.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.05 an ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.07.

<HEAD>Rain Falls Across Much of Nation; Fair in the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell across much of the nation today, encompassing the
central Plains, the Midwest and the East, while fair conditions
prevailed in the West.
   Hail the size of marbles fell Tuesday at Stover, Mo., and south
of Navarre, Kan. Golf ball-size hail hit near Millerstown, Ky, near
Munfordville, Ky., at Bridgeton, Mo., Villa Ridge, Mo.,
Campbellsville, Ky., Arnold Mo., Columbia Ill., and Wichita, Kan.
   Damage from wind gusts accompanying thunderstorms was reported
southwest of Louisville, Ky., and near Columbia and Troy, both in
Missouri.
   Winds gusted to about 70 mph at Denver and Marshall, Mo., to 65
mph at Trenton, Ill., and to 60 mph at St Louis and near Vandalia,
Mo.
   Winds also gusted to 61 mph at Guadalupe Pass between Carlsbad,
N.M. and El Paso, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered late Tuesday in parts of the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Washington state,
Montana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Arkansas, missouri,
Illinois, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana,
Pennsylvania.
   Storms also extended from northeast New York state across
northern New England.
   Tornados killed a child, injured at least 14 others and damaged
scores of buildings in northern and western Oklahoma on Tuesday.
   Water from a swollen reservoir tumbled through floodgates in an
ever more powerful flow today, threatening to swamp 200 square
miles of southeastern Texas.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a disaster
area Tuesday by President Bush as National Guardsmen worked to
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which climbed toward a 45-year high.
   There was serious flooding along the little Blue, the Blue and
Platte rivers around Kansas City, Mo. Highways were closed by
flooding near Lees Summit, Smithville, and Independence, all in
Missouri.
   The little Blue was expected to crest as much as 26 feet higher
than flood stage.
   Flood warnings remained along the upper and middle reaches of
the Marais des Cygnes River in Kansas. The crest was expected to
reach Quenemo, Kan., Tuesday night, nearly 7 feet over flood stage,
and Pomona, Kan., today, about 2 feet over flood stage.
   Major flooding continued along the lower half of the middle Red
River basin. The river's predicted crest of about 7 feet higher
than flood stage at Coushatta, La., was expected to be higher than
the 1957 flood but about 2 feet lower than the record flood of 1945.
   A flood warning was posted for the little Miami River at
Milford, Ohio, and the river was out of its banks and flooding the
road near Loveland.
   Flooding also was reported at Greensurg, Ky., Tuesday evening.
   A few temperatures were unseasonably high. Records for the date
were set or tied in several cities, including Fort Myers, Fla, with
96 degrees, breaking the 95-degree record set in 1985.
   The nation's high temperature Tuesday _ 104 degrees _ was
recorded at Presidio and Lajitas, both in Texas.

<HEAD>Governor's Son Gets Special Treatment at State Library</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Republican Gov. John
Ashcroft had the state library opened on Mother's Day so her
12-year-old son could do research for a school report.
   Ashcroft said Tuesday, ``I was in church, with my other son,''
when his wife opened the library for her son Andy on Sunday. Asked
if he thought it was unfair for his son to enjoy the privilege, he
said: ``I don't know, I wasn't there.''
   Janet Ashcroft and Andy, a seventh-grader, spent more than two
hours in the library used primarily by the executive and
legislative branches of government. It is normally open only Monday
through Friday. Mrs. Ashcroft declined an interview request from
The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   But her husband said: ``I mean, you know, I guess my son got
some information out of a book. I don't know, so far, I think
that's, uh, we've been trying to get him to do that for about 7 or
8 years now and I think every time I can encourage my son to do a
little research, I'm going to do it.''
   State librarian Monteria Hightower said after she unlocked the
library's doors on her day off Sunday, an unidentified library
staffer remained in the building while the Ashcrofts were there
from 5 p.m. to about 7:30 p.m.
   ``We don't do homework assignments for children,'' she said.
``It is odd. When the services are closed, they are closed.''
   The employee will not be paid for the Sunday work, Ms. Hightower
said.

<TEXT>
   The tiny gallery that bought the world's most
expensive painting for an anonymous client in a New York auction
has added another trophy to Japan's growing collection of
masterpieces.
   The Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo bought ``Portrait of Dr.
Gachet,'' one of Vincent Van Gogh's last paintings, for $82.5
million after a 10-minute auction battle Tuesday with a telephone
bidder at Christie's auction house. The price includes a 10 percent
buyer's premium.
   A staff member of Hideto Kobayashi's one-room gallery in Tokyo's
fashionable Ginza district said the world record purchase, far
surpassing the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's ``Irises'' at a
Sotheby's auction in November 1987, came as a surprise.
   ``We weren't prepared for the deluge of reporters and
photographers this morning,'' said Kasunori Tanabe. ``The price is
amazing. It's as if we bought a dream.''
   Tanabe said the new owner of ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' is a
company listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
but declined to say more.
   In New York, Kobayashi told Japan's Kyodo News Service that his
client was ``extremely pleased.''
   Kobayashi established an independent gallery in the Ginza, home
to hundreds of similar art dealers, 12 years ago after working for
the nearby Fujii Gallery, Tanabe said.
   Both galleries are active collectors of Impressionist works.
   With Tuesday's purchase, Kobayashi joined a growing list of
record-setting Japanese art buyers.
   The world's third most expensive painting, ``Les Noces de
Pierrette (Pierrette's Wedding)'' by Pablo Picasso, was sold for
$48.9 million in November to Nippon Autopolis Co. The firm said it
planned to make the painting the centerpiece of an auto racing
theme resort.
   Another record smasher, ``Sunflowers,'' by van Gogh, sits in the
corporate headquarters of Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. in
Tokyo. The $39.9 million purchase in March 1987 was a world record
at the time and marked a high-profile return of Japanese buyers to
the world art market.
   Several others among the world's 10 most expensive paintings
have gone to Japanese buyers.
   Shigeki Kameyama, owner of the Mountain Tortoise Gallery in
Tokyo, owns at least two prize masterpieces: ``The Mirror,'' by
Picasso, bought at Sotheby's for $26.4 million in November, and
``Interchange,'' by Willem de Kooning, also bought from Sotheby's
in November for $20.6 million.
   An anonymous buyer, bidding through a Tokyo department store,
paid $38.46 million for Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin''
in a Christie's auction in 1988.
   Japanese dealers and collectors have bought 40 to 50 percent of
Impressionist works at Christies and Sotheby's auctions in the past
few years.
   Lackluster bidding in the most recent auctions indicates that
the meteoric price increases of the mid- to late-1980s have
plateaued, Sotheby's auctioneer Julian Thompson said in Tokyo last
month.
   But active Japanese participation at recent auctions indicates
that demand in Japan for the world's greatest masterpieces remains
strong, he said.

<TEXT>
   Australia will not permit the United
States to base nuclear weapons in its territory if the Pentagon
decides to withdraw its military forces from the Philippines, Prime
Minister Bob Hawke said today.
   The lease for the six extensive U.S. installations in the
Philippines expires in September 1991 without another agreement.
   The issue was raised by a report of a study by the Rand Corp.,
an American think tank, which said Australia was a possible option
if the United States had to leave the Philippines.
   Hawke said there had been no formal approach on the matter by
the United States and he did not expect one would. He said basing
nuclear weapons in Australia would go against provisions of the
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which it signed.
   U.S. Navy vessels, including some believed to have nuclear
weapons, have stopped in Australian ports, but U.S. authorities
have refused to say whether nuclear arms were aboard. Australia has
not pressed the issue.
   In dismissing the possibility of a U.S. transfer of bases, Hawke
said the Rand report was more than a year old and had been public
since December. He said the corporation was a private body that
could not speak for the U.S. government.
   It had identified Australia as one possibility, rather than as a
preferred option.
   Hawke said the negotiations with the Philippines were still at
an early stage and there was no reason to think a post-1991
agreement would not be reached.

   Clashes between government troops and
Communist rebels in the northern and central Philippines have left
25 people dead, the military said today.
   Troops killed 11 rebels and suffered six dead in an encounter
Monday with an undetermined number of Communist New People's Army
guerrillas in the town of Claveria, 270 miles north of Manila, a
military report said.
   A separate report said four soldiers and one rebel were killed
Tuesday when a guerrilla band ambushed a military patrol on the
central island of Negros, 300 miles south of Manila.
   In the Negros city of Bacolod, two rebels were killed in a
shootout with troops Tuesday, one day after a soldier was gunned
down by suspected rebels.
   The rebel army, which operates in most of the Philippines' 73
provinces, has been fighting for 21 years to establish a Marxist
government in the country.

<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways called on the United
States and foreign governments today to establish uniform
anti-terrorist security measures for all air carriers.
   In a full-page advertisement carried in The New York Times and
the Washington Post, Pan Am said security measures ordered by the
Federal Aviation Administration were required for American
airlines, but not for foreign carriers.
   ``To be effective, security systems must come about through a
cooperative team effort among governments, their agencies and
airlines,'' it said. ``To do otherwise would be to perpetuate the
present patchwork of rules and regulations.''
   The advertisement, signed by Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett,
came one day after the President's Commission on Aviation and
Security and Terrorism released a critical report on airline
security.
   The commission was convened to investigate the December 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed
259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground.
   Pan Am suggested that security systems could be supported by
government funds or a surcharge on all international air fares.
   ``Governments of all nations must take direct responsibility ...
by providing whatever resources are necessary for improving the
security of international air travel,'' the airline said.
   The presidential commission's report called on the government to
consider ``preemptive or retaliatory military strikes'' against
terrorist enclaves in other countries to combat air terrorism.
   A system should be set up to notify passengers of credible
terrorist threats, it said, and the government should take more
seriously the possibility of terrorist strikes in the United States.

   Rival Christian forces bombarded
residential districts of their enclave for an eighth straight day
today, killing four people and wounding 23.
   That raised the overall casualty toll to 1,026 dead and 2,753
injured since the battle between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops
and Lebanese Forces militiamen led by Samir Geagea for dominance of
the Christian enclave broke out Jan. 30.
   Aoun today was quoted by the conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper as
denying an earlier report that he offered to step aside if the
Maronite Catholic synod of archbishops under Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir asked him to.
   ``I am staying at Baabda to welcome Geagea's fighters here,''
Aoun told Ad-Diyar in an interview, referring to the presidential
palace.
   At sunrise, Aoun's troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen battled
with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons in the
alleyways of east Beirut's Badaro, Sin el-Fil and Ein Rummaneh
disricts, according to police.
   Overnight explosions shook Christian east Beirut as well as the
pine-covered mountains northeast of the capital.
   The two sides have fought each other to a standstill. There has
been no clear-cut victor, but the Lebanese Forces control
two-thirds of the 310-square-mile enclave.
   ``We don't want Aoun nor Geagea. I wish you go to hell. You're
killing our children. You're starving us and you're kidnapping our
men,'' said a weeping woman on Geagea's Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.
television during Tuesday night's newscast.
   ``We've always coexisted. You just leave us and you'll see how
we can live together peacefully,'' she said.
   Aoun, Geagea, and Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi are
Maronites, the community that dominated power since Lebanon gained
independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun holds the presidential palace, refusing to hand it over to
Hrawi because he contends Hrawi's election by parliament on Nov. 24
was unconstitutional.
   Aoun also rejected a peace plan worked out by parliament at a
special session in Taif, Saudi Arabia last fall to end Lebanon's
civil war, because it did not specify a timetable for Syrian
withdrawel.
   Hrawi was elected to enforce the Taif plan, which gives Moslems
an equal share of parliamentary power with the Christians and
envisions the government ruling over a united Beirut.

<HEAD>Aborigines Attack Report Saying Prison No Deterrent For Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Aborigine group today branded as
racist and ridiculous an official report saying their people
receive better care in prison than at home and do not see
incarceration as a deterrent.
   The Queensland Corrective Services Commission said in a report
Tuesday night to the state parliament that prison provided better
housing, education, medical and recreational facilities than most
aborigine prisoners experience outside.
   ``Tragically they do not see it as a deterrent,'' State Justice
Minister Glenn Milliner said.
   The report said aborigines and another group of Australia
natives, the Torres Strait Islanders, comprise 20 percent of prison
inmates in Queensland state, but only 2.6 percent of the population.
   The Queensland Aboriginal Legal Service called the findings
racist and ridiculous. The legal service's vice-chairman, Steve
Mam, said the vast majority of Aborigines and Islanders would be
``horrified'' if charged with a criminal offense, let alone sent to
prison.
   ``Most prisoners come out of jail having learned only about
violence and brutality,'' he said in a statement.
   Aborigines have been living in Australia for at least 40,000
years and today number about 160,000, or less than 1 percent of the
total population.
   Keith Hamburger, director general of the Corrective Services
Commission, said Australian society has to confront the social
crisis facing Aborigines and Islanders.
   ``There is no doubt that if the community as a whole would face
up to its responsibility to solve the awful social crisis facing
this much-maligned and disadvantaged, yet potentially talented
ethnic minority, there would be immense social benefits to our
society as a whole,'' he said.
   The Department of Aboriginal Affairs said Aborigines have a life
expectancy 20 years less than other Australians and an unemployment
rate six times the national average.
   The government has said that 100 aborigines have died in police
custody since 1980.

   Organizers of the Goddess of Democracy
ship today called on a senior Taiwanese official to try to remove
roadblocks to their planned radio broadcasts to China, a spokesman
for the vessel said.
   The 1,200-ton ship, which arrived in nearby Keelung harbor
Sunday to take on provisions, is awaiting approval by customs
officials to take on radio equipment needed to beam the broadcasts
from international waters.
   A broker who was to help the ship handle the customs procedures
pulled out Tuesday, and the ship has yet to find another agent.
Organizers said they do not know when the ship will be able to set
sail with all the necessary equipment on board.
   Organizers originally planned to leave Keelung on Thursday and
begin broadcasts the following day.
   Ship spokesman Pascal Dupont said he, other organizers and
Chinese dissident Yan Jiaqi outlined the project _ and the
difficulties it was encountering _ to government spokesman Shaw
Yu-ming during the 45-minute meeting.
   ``We also asked Mr. Shaw different things we want to know,''
Dupont said, refusing to elaborate.
   Dupont said Shaw promised to make an official response soon. The
government spokesman was not available for comment.
   Local newspapers have quoted unidentified government authorities
as saying the ship already has reminded the world of the crackdown
on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing in June and should abandon
plans to broadcast to China.
   Although Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party is a sworn enemy
of the Beijing government, tensions between the two sides have
eased in recent years as business and civilian contacts have
expanded.
   China has accused Taiwan of secretly helping the Goddess of
Democracy and has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
broadcasts. The Nationalists have denied involvement in the project
and have said the vessel cannot return to take on more provisions
after the broadcasts begin.
   The Goddess of Democracy is named after the statue erected by
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in May. It was
destroyed during the June 4 military crackdown that left hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of civilians dead.
   The ship is sponsored by a coalition of French news
organizations and has a French crew. Although the vessel plans to
broadcast taped messages from Chinese dissidents who escaped the
crackdown, none of them is expected to be on board.

   Voters in liberal Eugene have rejected the
chance to strengthen the city's nuclear-free zone ordinance.
   With 24 percent of the precincts reporting from Tuesday's
primary elections, 13,789 voters, or 70 percent, opposed the
measure, while 5,304, or 27 percent, supported it.
   The margin of defeat surprised both supporters and opponents of
the initiative that would have toughened an ordinance that bans the
local manufacture of nuclear weapons and their components.
   The initiative also would have required nuclear-free zone signs
at entrances to the city and an annual nuclear-free commemoration
event. The city would send notices about the ordinance each year to
the Oregon governor, the state's congressional delegation and all
nations that possess nuclear weapons.
   ``The opposition spent close to $70,000, and we spent $6,000,''
said Steve Johnson, chief petitioner for the initiative. ``That's
the most money ever spent in Eugene on a ballot measure.''
   Johnson said opponents got a boost when a company cited the
measure in taking 250 jobs elsewhere, and other businesses
threatened to relocate if the measure passed.
   ``We believe in peace because we do have a nuclear free zone,''
Eugene Mayor Jeff Miller. ``People are saying that we have other
important things to deal with.
   In 1988, voters approved an advisory measure asking whether the
nuclear free zone should be retained.
   Rohr Industries Inc., which manufactures parts for the aerospace
industry, said it had selected Eugene for a $15 million plant.
After company officials learned of the pending initiative, Rohr
decided to build the plant in San Marcos, Texas.

   The Simon Wiesenthal Center inadvertently
invited Frederic Malek, who once compiled a list of Jewish
officials for President Nixon, to help chair an event commemorating
the Holocaust.
   Malek, the president of Northwest Airlines, resigned from George
Bush's presidential campaign in September 1988 after it became
known that he compiled the 1971 list for Nixon, who Malek said
thought a ``Jewish cabal'' was trying to undercut his economic
record.
   A spokeswoman for the Wiesenthal Center said the organization
contacted every major American corporation and asked for the
participation of their top executive to serve as a co-chairman for
the June 6 dinner to honor journalists who covered the Holocaust.
   ``Had we realized Frederic Malek was president of Northwest
Airlines, the invitation to serve as a vice chairman would not have
been extended,'' said Rhonda Barad, the group's Eastern regional
director.
   Malek accepted the offer, however, and his name appears on
invitations to the $500-a-plate dinner.
   Now, ``if Mr. Malek wants to come he is more than welcome,''
said Barad. ``He might find it to be a very moving and educational
experience.''
   Malek has insisted to numerous Jewish groups that he is not
anti-Semitic. He said he was under intense pressure from Nixon to
deliver the list of officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

   A federal appeals court has opened the way
for construction of a $200 million observatory on an Arizona
mountaintop where a colony of endangered squirrels lives.
   Environmentalists attacked the order Tuesday by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals and said they would argue against the
Mount Graham telescope at congressional hearings June 26.
   ``What the 9th Circuit did was confirm that the Endangered
Species Act is dead, and specifically anybody with enough money can
kill it at will,'' said Robin Silver, spokesman for the Maricopa
Audubon Society.
   The University of Arizona, which claims its observatory in
southeastern Arizona will not harm the 180 Mount Graham red
squirrels, said it hopes construction will begin in four to six
weeks.
   ``We're very pleased that the appellate court thought the
project should proceed,'' University of Arizona spokesman Steve
Emerine said.
   The two-member appeals court lifted a four-month freeze on the
telescope imposed March 26 by U.S. District Judge Alfredo Marquez
in Tucson. Marquez was responding to fears the project would lead
to extinction of the squirrel.
   Two U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees claimed the agency
had suppressed their reservations about the telescope's effects on
the squirrel population when it released a 1988 impact report.
   The report found no danger to the squirrel's survival, leading
to congressional authorization for the project.
   The appeals panel said Tuesday it did not appear the evidence
presented to Marquez was new information not previously considered
by Congress.
   The court specified that the judge could reinstate the freeze
``should subsequent proceedings reveal effects of the project not
previously considered.''
   But Silver said: ``Every major national environmental and
conservation group joined together to fight this from happening.
This project sets the precedent for abolition of environmental law
and ignores the fact that alternative, less destructive astronomy
sites exist.''
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan provoked an outcry from
environmentalists last week when he said, ``Nobody's told me the
difference between a red squirrel, a black one or a brown one.'' He
called on Congress to weaken the Endangered Species Act.
   The act prohibits any development that would harm species on the
Endangered Species List.

   Lucille, Doris and Ida are three widows in
search of a play.
   Lucille is the saucy one, always on the prowl for bargains and a
new man. Doris is the sour one, practical but suspicious of good
fortune. Ida is the sweet one, diplomatic and generous to her
friends and family.
   In the course of a long two hours, you don't learn much more
about these charter members of ``The Cemetery Club,'' Ivan
Menchell's tepid little tombstone comedy that opened Tuesday at
Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater.
   What it's doing there is not entirely clear. The play should
have bypassed Broadway altogether and gone directly to summer
stock, dinner theaters and community playhouses. But its real home
is television, maybe as a so-so movie of the week or ``Golden
Girls'' on an off-night.
   At first, the plot seems promising. The three friends meet
regularly at a graveyard in Queens, talk to their dead husbands and
wonder how they will get on with their lives. To its credit, the
dialogue is not maudlin. But it's not very interesting either.
   Their female camaraderie is shattered by the appearance of Sam
the butcher, a widower who also makes regular cemetery visits to
his dead wife. Sam takes a fancy to Ida _ that's the sweet one _
and suddenly, it's every woman for herself.
   But the play degenerates into a succession of tired jokes about
Perpetual Care, Blue Cross, philandering husbands, gas pains,
Jewish weddings and their good friend, the much-married but
never-seen Selma who is tying the knot again, this time with an
Italian.
   At Selma's wedding reception, Sam not only escorts Ida and her
friends but brings Mildred, a predatory woman out to snare the
mild-mannered butcher. She causes a rift between Ida and Sam. Their
problems are eventually solved, but not before a few tears are shed.
   The cast seems stymied by the material, particularly Eileen
Heckart as the abrasive but really soft-hearted Lucille. She plays
it one-note cute, underlining all her laugh lines with her
honey-coated voice inflections. More successful are Doris Belack as
the no-nonsense Doris and especially Elizabeth Franz as Ida, who
makes a few of the stickier speeches about getting on with life
after the death of a spouse affecting.
   The sole male role is played by Lee Wallace, who earned murmurs
of approval from a preview audience because he bears an astonishing
resemblance to former New York Mayor Edward Koch. He's also a
pretty good actor.
   Director Pamela Berlin, who had more luck with another
female-bonding play called ``Steel Magnolias,'' can't inject much
life into the script.
   The liveliest moments of the play occur when John Lee Beatty's
wonderful cemetery set, including several rows of headstones, rolls
into view. Beatty also has come up with a splendid New York skyline
backdrop for his Queens graveyard. And when the roar of jet engines
occasionally interrupts the proceedings, it seems more real than
anything else on stage.
   ``The Cemetery Club'' received poor reviews elsewhere.
   In the New York Post, reviewer Clive Barnes said, ``it is
certainly within a genre of play that, say 30 years ago, before the
age of TV sitcoms and cheapo movies of that same ilk, Broadway and
most of its critics would have embraced. But I fear these Golden
Girls are too late.''
   And in the New York Daily News, critic Howard Kissel said, ``I
wouldn't be surprised to learn it was originally written as a TV
pilot, which the networks had the good sense to reject.''
   New York Newsday critic Leo Seligsohn also compared it to
television: ```The Cemetery Club' is `The Golden Girls' marinated
in chicken soup. Rarely has a play been so targeted at a particular
audience as this.''
   In The New York Times, drama critic Frank Rich was a bit more
ruthless: ``Moving at the leisurely pace of a contentious canasta
hand, `The Cemetery Club' could be one of the best arguments yet
advanced for cremation.''

<TEXT>
   A U.S. official reacted angrily today
when the Philippines claimed the United States owes it more than
$222 million in compensation and that the debt could jeopardize
talks on American bases.
   At Clark Air Base, more than 600 people attended a memorial
service for two U.S. airmen slain Sunday by Communist rebels
opposed to the bases. In a message read at the ceremony, President
Bush promised their deaths would not deter the United States from
``the cause of freedom.''
   In Manila, police arrested 15 people in the third straight day
of anti-bases protests coinciding with talks toward a new bases
agreement. They were among 300 people, who included Roman Catholic
nuns and representatives of 14 nations, who tried to march to the
U.S. Embassy but were blocked by police.
   Filipino delegates complained that the United States had fallen
short by $222.6 million in aid promised to Manila to maintain the
six U.S. military installations whose lease runs out in September
1991, said Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine panel.
   U.S. officials acknowledge only a $96 million shortfall.
   Alunan warned that the disagreement could jeopardize the talks.
   ``The way I see it, that will endanger the future of the talks
with the United States,'' he said. ``I would like to think that
both sides are prepared to work out their differences as friends
and allies are expected to do.''
   The two sides agreed to set up a committee to study the issue.
   However, the chief U.S. delegate, Richard Armitage, reacted
angrily to the Philippine statement about the outstanding debt. A
spokesman for the U.S. delegation, Stanley Schrager, quoted
Armitage as saying he did not ``stand next to a cash register when
conducting foreign relations.''
   The issue of back payments was raised during the third day of
talks between the United States and the Philippines on a new bases
agreement. The two delegations canceled an afternoon session so
they could attend the memorial service for the two American airmen
at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.
   The killings of Airmen John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction,
Alaska, and James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo., were believed
timed to coincide with the opening of the talks.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt read Bush's message at the
service.
   ``Barbara and I want to express our shock and sorrow at the
brutal murders of Airman John Raven and Airman James Green,'' the
message said. ``Terrorism will not deflect our nation from its
purpose, to preserve and protect democracy and freedom.''
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, chief Philippine delegate at
the bases talks, told reporters afterward that he attended to
``stress the position of our government that these acts of killing
unarmed American soldiers is an act of weakness and diminishes the
dignity and honor of the people of the Philippines.''
   Armitage said the killings ``will not shake our resolve to see
the talks through'' on the bases.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility and vowed more attacks
until all U.S. troops leave the country.
   In a related development, military dissidents also called for
the bases to be closed by 1991. The statement was telephoned to
news organizations by the Revolutionary Alliance of the
Masses-Soldiers of the Filipino People, which led the Dec. 1-9
failed attempt to overthrow President Corazon Aquino.
   Meanwhile, sources in the U.S. military community said
restrictions had been further tightened after Sunday's killing.
   At Clark, airmen formerly housed in civilian hotels were brought
back to the base, the sources said. Single sailors and Marines who
had been living off-post have been ordered back to barracks at
Subic, the sources added.
   Troops are being billeted in gymnasiums and are doubling up in
the barracks, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Following Sunday's killings, the U.S. military barred off-post
leaves for the 40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents. Those living off post were ordered to stay in
their homes after duty hours.

<TEXT>
   Housing starts plummeted 5.8 percent in April
to their lowest level in nearly eight years, the government said
today. It was their third consecutive sharp decline.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million units,
the smallest number since 1.17 million units got under way in
October 1982 during the last recession.
   Starts plunged a revised 11.2 percent in March and 5.1 percent
in February. They originally were reported to have been down 9.3
percent in March and 7.1 percent in February.
   Housing starts had climbed 23.2 percent to an annual rate of
1.57 million units in January, the warmest in history. But analysts
had said the weather-related pace could not be sustained.
   Analysts also had said in advance of today's report that the
housing industry continues to be hampered by double-digit mortgage
rates. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates ranged
between 10.26 percent at the beginning of April and 10.56 percent
at month's end.
   Some also cited tighter lending policies in some overbuilt real
estate markets that tend to slow construction.
   Construction of single-family homes in April fell 7.5 percent to
an annual rate of 934,000 units after dropping 12.5 percent in
posted the only gain in starts, up 3.8 percent to an
annual rate of 298,000 units.
   Starts in the South dropped 8.7 percent to an annual rate of
480,000. They were down 8.1 percent to 340,000 units in the West
and 8.0 percent to 127,000 units in the Northeast.
   Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
housing activity, fell 8.7 percent to 1.13 million. It was the
lowest level since 1.05 million permits were issued in September
1982. Permits had dropped 5.0 percent in March.

   Radical students hurling rocks and
firebombs battled riot police today in Kwangju and at least four
other cities, news reports said. About 20 people were reported hurt.
   The violence came as dissidents called for nationwide protests
Friday to mark the 10th anniversary of a bloody rebellion in
Kwangju. The worst of today's fighting was reported in the city,
155 miles south of Seoul.
   Clashes were also reported today in Seoul, Pusan, Cheju and
Chonju.
   Meanwhile, 24,000 workers today ended their 3-week-old strike at
the world's biggest shipyard with their demands unmet. However,
laborers at the country's leading auto plant stayed off the job for
a second day.
   The car plant and shipyard, both subsidiaries of the Hyundai
conglomerate, are located in Ulsan, 160 miles southeast of Seoul.
   The national news agency Yonhap said the violence began in
Kwangju when riot police firing tear gas from armored vans stormed
a university to disperse 2,000 students holding an anti-government
rally.
   The students, wielding steel pipes and throwing rocks, firebombs
and other missiles, fought 1,000 riot police, it said.
   About 20 students and police were injured during the two-hour
clash, Yonhap said, including one student who was seriously hurt
when he was hit in the face by fragments of an exploding tear gas
canister.
   In Seoul today, a major dissident group called the People's
Alliance announced it would organize anti-government protests in
the capital and 16 other cities to mark Friday's Kwangju
anniversary.
   About 200 citizens were killed and more than 1,500 injured when
the South Korean army was used to quell the May 18, 1980, uprising
in the city of Kwangju. Dissidents claim the death toll was much
higher.
   The National Police Headquarters ordered an immediate full-scale
alert to try to curtail violence. Yonhap said up to 100,000 people
were expected to partipate in Friday's demonstrations.
   Meanwhle, at the shipyard in Ulsan, 24,000 workers today were
busy cleaning offices and tools to resume work, the company said.
It said only 3 percent of the workers were absent, which they
called a normal percentage.
   On April 28, 12,000 police firing tear gas rushed into the
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard to expel workers occupying
the plant for three days.
   The workers struck to demand the release of several jailed union
leaders. Later, the laborers changed tactics, deciding to return to
work while continuing negotiations. Hyundai officials said the
shipyard had about $100 million in lost sales during the stoppage.
   Workers of many Hyundai subsidiaries and other plants staged
sympathy strikes to protest the police raid. Most returned to work
a week or so later.
   At the nearby auto plant, thousands of workers remained off the
job after talks on a new contract failed to make progress.
   The car plant produces 2,650 vehicles a day and sold 589,000
cars last year, including 200,000 subcompact cars in the United
States and other nations.
   Union leaders at Hyundai Motor Co., the country's biggest car
maker, said 27,000 auto assembly workers would not return to work
unless the company accepts union demands for more pay and a shorter
work week. The union also said it will continue to fight for
greater say in the company's management.

<HEAD>Casey Faces Pro-Choice Republican; Nebraska Dems in Tight Race</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with final vote totals in Omaha, recount
likely in Democratic primary, UPDATED total in Pennsylvania and
Oregon. No pickup.</NOTE>

   Pennsylvania voters set the stage for an unusual governor's race
between an anti-abortion Democrat _ Gov. Robert P. Casey _ and a
pro-choice Republican. In Nebraska, two Democrats faced a likely
recount in a tight race to challenge Gov. Kay Orr, who won the GOP
primary handily.
   In the Oregon governor's campaign, Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer dominated Tuesday's GOP primary and advanced to a
November general election against Democratic Secretary of State
Barbara Roberts, who had no primary opposition. The Democratic
incumbent, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, is retiring.
   U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon breezed past a single
Republican challenger to win nomination for a fifth term. His
November challenger, businessman Harry Lonsdale, overwhelmed a
six-candidate Democratic field.
   Two-term Democratic Sen. James Exon of Nebraska had no primary
opposition, and former Republican Rep. Hal Daub easily won the
nomination to challenge him.
   The Pennsylvania governor's primary was dominated by the
abortion issue, and the general election is shaping up along
similar lines.
   Casey signed the nation's most restrictive state abortion law
last fall, putting him at odds with many Democrats nationally. But
he easily turned back a pro-choice Democrat in the primary and now
faces a pro-choice Republican, state Auditor General Barbara Hafer,
in the fall.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Casey had 630,892
votes, or 77 percent, to 184,656, 23 percent, for lawyer Philip S.
Berg of suburban Philadelphia.
   Hafer had the backing of GOP leaders despite her pro-choice
stand. Still, she had a tougher time than expected in defeating an
anti-abortion challenger, Marguerite ``Peg'' Luksik. Hafer had
319,670 votes, or 54 percent, to Luksik's 268,563 votes, or 46
percent.
   Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark S. Singel, like Casey an opponent of
abortion, survived a challenge on the issue from former state party
chairman Edward Mezvinsky. Singel had 531,931 votes, or 71 percent,
to Mezvinsky's 215,368 votes, or 29 percent.
   In western Pennsylvania, Democratic Reps. John Murtha, Austin
Murphy and Joseph Kolter all survived primary challenges.
   In Nebraska, Mrs. Orr overwhelmed her lone GOP challenger, Omaha
businessman Mort Sullivan, and then sat back to see who her
Democratic opponent would be.
   The answer was slow in coming, with the seven-candidate
Democratic primary turning into a three-way cliffhanger.
   Bill Hoppner, a former aide to Exon and to Sen. Bob Kerry,
emerged on top, followed closely by Omaha businessman Ben Nelson
and by former Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle.
   Hoppner had 44,281 votes, or 27 percent, Nelson had 44,187
votes, or 27 percent, and Boyle had 41,154 or 25 percent.
   Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris, trailed with 31,361 votes, or 19
percent, and three lesser-known candidates shared the remaining 3
percent of the vote.
   Hoppner held a 94-vote margin over Nelson, and absentee ballots
won't be counted until Thursday. State law requires a recount if
the margin of victory is 1 percent or less.
   In the GOP race, Mrs. Orr had 129,116 votes to Sullivan's 58,727
votes, a 69-31 percent spread.
   ``We are laying the groundwork for the November election,'' the
governor said. ``We already have garnered support in all of the
counties across the state and we're going to build a fantastic,
strong, thousands-strong grass-roots organization for our efforts.''
   In the Republican Senate race, Daub defeated Otis Glebe, an
Omaha landlord, to gain the right to challenge Exon. Daub had
176,422, or 92 percent, to Glebe's 16,291, or 8 percent.
   In Oregon, Frohnmayer whipped six other Republicans to leap into
the gubernatorial race with Roberts. With 89 percent of the
precincts counted, he had 197,712 votes, or 79 percent, nearly
seven times as many votes as his closest challenger.
   Hatfield, Oregon's senior senator, trounced environmentalist
Randy Prince, a political unknown. With 89 percent of precincts
reporting, he had 192,703 votes, or 78 percent, to Prince's 55,195
votes, or 22 percent.
   Lonsdale, who financed his own campaign, fared almost as well in
the crowded Democratic race. With 89 percent of the precincts
reporting, he had 139,217 votes, or 63 percent, with the remainder
divided among the other six candidates.
   Residents of the college town of Eugene soundly defeated a
measure to toughen an ordinance banning the local manufacture of
nuclear weapons and their components.

   U.S. airmen wiped away tears
and a lone bugle played taps today at a memorial service for two
American servicemen who were slain by Communist rebels.
   About 600 people attended a 45-minute service at Clark for
Airmen John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and James C.
Green, 20, of Craig, Colo.
   In a message read at the ceremony, President Bush promised that
their deaths would not deter the United States from ``the cause of
freedom.''
   The two were shot near the base 50 miles north of Manila on
Sunday, on the eve of the opening of talks on the future of U.S.
bases in the Philippines. Communist insurgents opposed to the bases
claimed responsibility.
   ``Barbara and I want to express our shock and sorrow at the
brutal murders of Airman John Raven and Airman James Green,'' said
the presidential message, read by U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt.
   ``Terrorism will not deflect our nation from its purpose, to
preserve and protect democracy and freedom,'' the message said.
   Platt, who delivered his own remarks after reading Bush's
message, said the two were killed by ``cowardly assassins.''
   ``Anyone who believes they can gain any kind of support or
benefit from shooting unarmed visitors in cold blood is bound to
fail,'' he said.
   During the service at the base's interdenominational chapel, two
American flags, folded in triangles, rested on the altar.
   Most of those attending were in battle dress. They listened with
heads bowed, and several were seen wiping away tears.
   The U.S. and Philippine delegations to the talks on the bases
canceled an afternoon session so they could attend the memorial
service.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, the chief Philippine delegate,
told reporters afterward that he attended to ``stress the position
of our government that these acts of killing unarmed American
soldiers is an act of weakness and diminishes the dignity and honor
of the people of the Philippines.''
   The chief U.S. delegate, Richard Armitage, said the killings
``will not shake our resolve to see the talks through'' on the
bases.
   The unit the slain men belonged to, the 8th Aircraft Generation
Squadron, was at Clark for temporary duty from its regular station,
Kunsan Air Base in South Korea. ``They were ... only here for
temporary duty, a duty that turned out to be eternal,'' Platt said.

<HEAD>Teacher Beaten in France; Jewish Cemetery Desecrated in Italy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two masked men beat up a high school
teacher, calling her a ``dirty Jew'' and a ``dirty Arab,'' after
she devoted a class to racism in response to the desecration of a
Jewish cemetery, the teacher said today.
   The reported attack was the latest in a series of racist
incidents since the discovery on Thursday of the desecration of
gravestones and the mutilation of a corpse at Carpentras, in
southern France.
   Also today, officials in Naples, Italy, said vandals dug up
tombs and overturned 20 grave-stones in a Jewish cemetery. The
desecration occurred about two weeks ago but was made public only
this week by leaders of Naples' 200-member Jewish community.
   The mayor of Naples, Pietro Lezzi, met Tuesday with Jewish
officials and expressed his indignation.
   Christiane Guiard, a history and geography teacher at the Emile
Zola College of Royan, near Bordeaux, said she was getting out of
her bathtub Monday morning when two masked intruders entered her
home and beat her.
   The reported attack followed several threats in anonymous
telephone calls, she said, speaking from her hospital bed.
   The men ``told me `dirty Jew, dirty Arab, you were warned,'''
said Mrs. Guiard, 41, who suffered several cuts and remained under
medical surveillance at the Malakoff Hospital of Royan. ``The
reason? I see one. It's racism.''
   Moslem immigrants have been the target of racist attacks.
Extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who frequently utters
anti-Semitic remarks, says he favors expelling France's 3.4 million
Moslem immigrants.
   Mrs. Guiard said she used the desecration of the Carpentras
cemetery to teach a class Saturday on racism to her 15- and
16-year-old students.
   She said she discussed France's anti-racism law of 1972. ``I
noted to the students that since this law, freedom of expression
still exists, of course, but that racism in any form is not an
opinion but a crime.''
   School Principal Henry Bugnet gave police a complete list of the
parents of the students, who were expected to be questioned by
police.
   The attack was denounced at the National Assembly today, first
by the Communist group, then by Health Minister Claude Evin.
   Since the discovery of the desecration of the Carpentras
cemetery, swastikas and neo-Nazi slogans have appeared on buildings
in several towns and on Jewish tombs in a suburban Paris cemetery.

<HEAD>High Court Harmed Religious Freedom, Scholar Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scholar for the nation's largest ecumenical
group says the U.S. Supreme Court weakened religious freedom when
it said a state could punish two men who used an illegal drug in a
church ritual.
   ``The main pillar upholding the venerable and precious right of
religious liberty in the Constitution has been virtually
repealed,'' said Dean Kelley, speaking Tuesday at a Pittsburgh
conference of the National Council of Churches.
   Needless language in the recent ruling means states easily can
prosecute people who cite their beliefs as reasons for violating
laws, said Kelley, the church council's director of religious
freedom and an authority on church-state relations.
   Board members of the council, which represents 32 church
organizations with 42 million members, agreed to draft a resolution
calling for the high court to reconsider the April 17 ruling.
   The justices, in a 6-3 decision, said Oregon officials could
withhold unemployment pay from two members of the Native American
Church who used peyote, a hallucinogenic drug derived from a
cactus, as part of their worship.
   ``It's not just the Indians that caught it in that case. It's
all religions, including ours,'' Kelley said.
   ``This case holds that criminal punishment of the central
religious ritual of an ancient faith raises no issue under the free
exercise clause and requires no justification!'' wrote law
professor Douglas Laycock, of the University of Texas, in remarks
prepared for the church council.
   The court weakened the freedom of religion clause in the Bill of
Rights when Justice Antonin Scalia's majority decision said
prosecutors must show only ``a rational means to achieve a
legitimate end'' to obtain a conviction when religion is used as a
defense, Kelley said.
   Previously, the government needed to establish a ``compelling
state interest'' to override the constitutional protection of
religious freedom, he said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who voted against the workers but
dissented from the majority opinion, said the court didn't need to
lift the ``compelling state interest'' provision.
   ``It's a whole new ball game now,'' Kelley said. ``The
ecumenical communions have tended to be very relaxed about alleged
threats to religious liberty ... but the time has come for real
alarm.''
   Kelley said the high court's ruling affects dozens of pending
cases involving religious freedom, and one faith already has noted
the effects of the Oregon case.
   The justices told Minnesota's high court to use the peyote
decision in reconsidering a ruling involving Amish farmers in that
state.
   The Minnesota justices said the state couldn't enforce a law
requiring Amish buggy drivers to place a bright orange triangle on
their vehicles. The Amish considered the triangles garish, and
agreed to use silver reflectors.
   In another case in Clearwater, Fla., the high court's ruling
supersedes a federal judge's ruling that the city can't force
churches to disclose financial data if they accept donations,
Kelley said.
   Also, 49 states have laws protecting the confidentiality of
talks between a priest and members of his congregation, but the
high court's ruling could force the clergy to reveal information if
those states repeal those laws. West Virginia is the only state
that doesn't have a law protecting communications with priests.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, was sworn in
today to succeed the late Spark M. Matsunaga as Hawaii's junior
senator.
   Akaka, 63, was escorted to the well of the Senate chamber by the
state's senior senator, Daniel K. Inouye, also a Democrat. The oath
of office was administered by Senate President Pro Tem Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va.
   After taking the oath, Akaka signed his name in the official
Senate register as colleagues stood and applauded.
   Inouye introduced Akaka as the first native Hawaiian to serve in
the Senate and said he ``epitomizes the highest virtues of what we
proudly call the aloha spirit of Hawaii.''
   Serving in the Senate ``fills me with enormous pride and
profound humility,'' Akaka said. ``I pledge to fill this high
office with dignity and honor'' and to carry on Matsunaga's
legislative agenda.
   Akaka was appointed by Gov. John D. Waihee III to serve until
the November election. Akaka and the islands' other House member,
Rep. Patricia Saiki, a Republican, are expected to square off in
November for the right to complete Matsunaga's term, which expires
at the end of 1994.
   Akaka has served since 1977 in the House, where he compiled a
liberal voting record. He is a former school teacher.

<TEXT>
   An independent Soviet circus stranded in
suburban Atlanta rejected free tickets home because the offer came
from someone with ties to its competitors.
   The Great Circus Bim Bom rejected the offer Tuesday from a
businessman who promotes the official Moscow Circus. At the same
time an Atlanta transportation company said it would not release
the troupe's costumes and equipment because it is owed $120,000,
forcing a delay in negotiations for new performances.
   ``The Moscow Circus is our competition. They would love to have
our artists go back to Russia,'' said Andy Trueman, managing
director of the circus, whose performers have been living in a
Marietta motel since its two-year goodwill tour was canceled last
week.
   ``Our artists are better than theirs,'' he added. ``It would
just be to get us out of town. We haven't been jumping at the
offer.''
   The businessman who offered the tickets, Steven E. Leber, said
the Bim Bom performers ``would rather be here making no money than
be there'' in the Soviet Union. ``They would like to stay in
America. They're not anxious to go home,'' he said.
   Leber's assistance was solicited by Soviet officials who fear
that the problems encountered by the independent Bim Bom troupe
will hurt future tours of the successful government-sponsored
Moscow Circus, which just completed an eight-month U.S. tour.
   The Bim Bom circus arrived in the United States March 31 and
played just two stops before cancelling its tour.
   Poor advance publicity led to low attendance at shows in
Hershey, Pa., and Knoxville, Tenn., and the circus claimed that its
backers also withdrew support. However, a lawyer for the backers
said his clients had merely given the circus a loan and had not
intended to back the whole tour.

<HEAD>West Germany Announces Fund to Help Rebuild East German Econonmy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today announced that it
and the nation's states will create a $70 billion unification fund
to rebuild East Germany's battered economy and merge it with West
Germany's.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said a
treaty that will formally merge the German economies on July 2 will
be signed at a ceremony in Bonn on Friday.
   Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg were to travel to Washington tonight
to brief President Bush on plans for unification.
   The German nations have been negotiating the economic treaty
since March. Under it, East Germany's nearly worthless currency
will be replaced by the West German mark, and social security
provisions will be made for East Germans, who will face widespread
joblessness as their economy is overhauled.
   The German Unity Fund to be created by West Germany will be part
of the economic merger package. The governors of the 11 West German
states agreed to help create it in talks with Kohl today.
   The states will contribute about $25 billion and the federal
government will provide the rest, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said
at a news conference.
   Earlier in the day, West German Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann urged East Germany to start now turning over state-run
companies to private owners.
   Haussmann said the Bonn government was ready to offer East
Germany $4.2 billion for restructuring companies after the economic
merger takes effect.
   He said that money would help ease the transition to a market
economy and massive unemployment. It was not clear if that money
would be separate from the German Unity Fund.
   Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union, suffered election
losses in two important West German states on Sunday, and he since
has tried to step up the pace of unification, including calling for
all-German elections as early as this year. The defeats apparently
were caused by concern among voters over the cost of unification.
There have not been any firm estimates of the cost.
   The suggestion for early joint elections drew criticism from the
West German opposition and from East German officials.
   Although Kohl has not suggested a date, his chief of staff,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, said all-German elections could be held on Dec.
2, the same date for West German federal elections. East Germany
announced Tuesday that it plans to hold state elections on the same
day.

   Pro-choice Republican Barbara Hafer won the
right to challenge anti-abortion Gov. Robert P. Casey in November
in a race that turns the usual political lineup on abortion upside
down.
   Casey, a Democrat who signed the nation's toughest state
abortion law in November, easily won nomination for another term
Tuesday by a 77-23 margin over pro-choice candidate Philip S. Berg,
a suburban Philadelphia lawyer.
   Hafer, the auditor general, emerged with a victory of 54-46
percent over Marguerite ``Pet'' Luksik, who had never sought public
office before and had no advertising budget. Luksik was supported
by right-to-life groups.
   The campaigns reversed the typical political alignments on
abortion, and the vote Tuesday showed that Casey was succeeding in
his effort to buck the national Democratic line.
   ``The result is a strong endorsement by the Democratic voters of
this state of our record of the last four years,'' Casey said.
``They support that agenda.'' Though abortion is important, he
said, people were just as concerned about his efforts to create
jobs, stop drugs and clean up the environmental.
   ``A lot of Republicans that I talked to across Pennsylvania
didn't even know there was a primary,'' Hafer said. ``We have to
remember that the pro-lifers are very organized. They went out and
worked and voted.
   ``This sends a message to the pro-choice people that we are not
organized,'' she said.
   In the Democratic lieutenant governor's race, anti-abortion
incumbent Mark S. Singel beat one-time state party chairman and
former Iowa congressman Edward Mezvinsky, a defector from the Casey
camp, by a 71-29 percent margin.
   Five Pennsylvania congressmen easily survived primary challenges.
   Voters also picked nominees for 203 state House seats and 25 of
50 state Senate seats.
   Groups favoring abortion rights failed to knock off Republican
state Rep. Stephen Freind, the author of the abortion law Casey
signed. It bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy,
requires spousal notification and a 24-hour waiting period.
   Freind beat businesswoman Ellen Fisher by a 52-48 percent margin.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting in the unofficial
count, Casey had 630,892 votes, or 77 percent, to 184,656, or 23
percent, for Berg. Hafer had 319,670 votes, or 54 percent, to
Luksik's 268,463 votes, or 46 percent. And Singel had 531,931 votes
to 215,368 for Mezvinsky, a margin of 71 percent to 29 percent.

   Long lines formed at
polling places today as Dominicans voted in what was seen as a
close contest between two old foes _ President Joaquin Balaguer and
former President Juan Bosch.
   The voting attracted 30 international observers, including
former President Jimmy Carter, who will work closely with the
electoral board, which tabulates votes from 4,000 polling stations
nationwide.
   Polls opened closed at 6 p.m. (same time EDT), and initial
returns were not expected until after midnight, the Central
Electoral Board said.
   By statute, businesses are closed today, and no liquor sales
were allowed.
   Balaguer and Bosch, both in their 80s, were voting separately at
the same polling station in a Santo Domingo residential area.
   Santo Domingo was calm Tuesday, with campaigning, commercials
and newscasts suspended for the day under the country's election
law.
   Police said at least six people were injured outside the capital
Monday night in clashes between opposing political supporters in
which motorcycles and at least one car were set on fire and rocks
were thrown at two houses.
   Balaguer, 83, a five-time president who is blind from glaucoma,
has been running under a campaign slogan ``Balaguer, a road without
danger,'' portraying Bosch as a dangerous Marxist. Balaguer's
popularity has declined since the last election four years ago as
the country's economic crisis deepened.
   Bosch, 80, elected president in 1963 but ousted only six months
into his term, has described himself as Marxist but not a
Communist. He has been campaigning as a moderate who will promote
capitalism and privatization.
   Carter, who arrived with his wife Rosalyn on Monday night, said
he was invited by electoral commission president Froilan Tavares
and will observe balloting to help guard against any fraud.
   ``We are here as objective analysts. We will certify if the
elections have been fair and free,'' Carter said.
   Bosch's leftist Dominican Liberation Party has been claiming
Balaguer organizers ``have prepared 300,000 phony ballots'' to rig
the vote, a charge denied by Balaguer's conservative Social
Christian Reformist Party.
   Over the weekend, the two candidates drew crowds estimated at
more than 100,000 each to outdoor rallies in Santo Domingo.
   Bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points over the
past year. But some observers believe he may be hurt by his
criticism last week of a 1954 agreement with the Vatican providing
all army chaplains be Roman Catholic. This nation of 7 million
people, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti,
is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   Balaguer, who briefly served as a figurehead president under
dictator Gen. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, won three consecutive
four-year terms after his first election in 1966. Since his last
re-election in 1986, he has embarked on a costly public-works
program.
   He is banking on the popularity of the new homes, apartments,
roads and schools to ensure re-election. The projects created a
construction and employment boom, but also fueled inflation at a
time when public services such as electricity are deteriorating
badly.
   Among the six other presidential candidates are Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez, a former Santo Domingo mayor and hero of the 1965 civil
war; and Jacobo Majluta, a former vice president who became
president for 43 days in 1982 after the suicide of President
Antonio Guzman. Majluta finished a close second to Balaguer in 1986.
   There are 3.2 million Dominicans eligible to vote for president,
vice president, 30 senators, 120 congressional deputies and 103
mayors. Eighteen political parties are fielding candidates.

   Tornadoes killed a child, injured at
least 14 people and destroyed or damaged scores of buildings in
northern and eastern Oklahoma, authorities said.
   One twister, bearing winds of 100 mph, cut a milelong swath in
Stillwater, hitting residential areas and the Oklahoma State
University campus. At least three other tornadoes touched down in
Oklahoma Tuesday night.
   A 4-year-old was killed in Stillwater as his mother drove to a
relative's home to take shelter, authorities said. Authorities said
the mother, who was cut, was unable to explain exactly what
happened when the storm overtook them.
   The tornadoes destroyed 17 homes and two businesses in this city
of 40,000, said police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet. He said 164 homes, five
apartment complexes, three schools, 12 businesses and two mobile
homes were damaged.
   About 40 housing units on the university campus were reported
damaged, and the storm tore part of the roof off the physical
education center.
   At least seven other people in Stillwater were treated for
injuries. The worst injury was a 75-year-old man who broke a hip.
   A twister hit the ground around midnight in Foyil, about 30
miles northeast of Tulsa, injuring at least six people as it plowed
across four miles of farmland.
   A tornado ripped off a roof near Kellyville, southwest of Tulsa,
and another twister west of Oklahoma City terrorized patrons and
workers inside an El Reno truck stop when it touched down near
Interstate 40.
   With power lines down, residents of Stillwater and Foyil waited
for daylight today to reveal the extent of the damage.
   ``I'm going to go back tomorrow and see what happened,'' said
Stillwater resident Jean Annesley, who spent the night in a Red
Cross shelter after her home was hit. ``It's going to kill me. But
I'll survive it.''
   Mike Field stood in his yard and looked at the wreckage from a
school roof that littered the inside and outside of his heavily
damaged house. He and his family had made it to shelter.
   ``When we were driving back, I saw a lot of trees down and
thought that maybe the trees here in my front yard would be
damaged,'' Field said.
   ``We turned the corner, the first thing I saw was the roof gone.
My wife started crying. What are you going to do?''

<HEAD>Move to Seize Tenant Leases Criticized by ACLU</HEAD>

other anti-drug measures.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil libertarians are concerned over a
new push by the federal government to seize leases from public
housing tenants suspected of dealing drugs, even if they face no
criminal charges.
   The proposal, announced Tuesday by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp,
will target 23 cities nationwide using the asset forfeiture
provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
   Meanwhile, other Bush administration officials were sending
Congress a package of anti-drug measures that would give the
Immigration and Naturalization Service greater authority to deport
non-citizens without hearings.
   Duke Austin, chief spokesman for the service, said Tuesday the
plan would add a small number of serious drug offenses _ such as
trafficking or possession with intent to distribute _ to the list
of serious crimes for which conviction can bring deportation
without hearings.
   Those hearings and subsequent appeals can take two years.
   Among anti-drug proposals being sent to Congress today to
implement President Bush's updated drug control strategy issued in
January are proposals that:
   _Allow the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   _Allow the extradition of U.S. citizens to foreign countries
even if the United States is not obligated by the extradition
treaties involved.
   _Make drug-related public corruption punishable by up to 25
years imprisonment.
   _Allow officials to seize the assets of violators of
drug-paraphernalia statutes and impose civil penalties.
   _Make it a criminal offense not to obey a federal law
enforcement officer's order to land an aircraft or bring-to a
vessel.
   Kemp described his proposal Tuesday, saying, ``When the cases
for forfeiture are filed and approved by the local federal courts,
U.S. marshals will promptly take custody of the apartments from
which the traffickers are operating.''
   Such an action, Kemp said, ``specifically targets serious drug
traffickers, because the standard of proof for a forfeiture order
is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the apartment has been
used for the commission of a drug felony.''
   Kemp, who spoke at a conference hosted by the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, declined to identify the 23 cities involved in
the program.
   The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the proposal.
   ``It takes a solid principle of American jurisprudence _ which
is that you are innocent until proven guilty _ and turns it on its
head,'' said ACLU spokeswoman Colleen O'Connor.
   ``It suggests the governmeninto ``a means of enforcing the drug
laws.''
   Kemp noted that civil liberties concerns were raised last year
when he took steps to speed up evictions of public housing tenants
involved in drug activity, and he said, ``We are carefully
addressing'' those concerns.
   Bud Albright Jr., deputy general counsel for the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, said the leasehold seizures by
public housing authorities working with U.S. attorneys would be
aimed solely at large-scale operations.
   But David Bryson of the National Housing Law Center said it will
be difficult to limit the targets once the operation is under way.
   ``The difficulty is once Secretary Kemp gives out this message
and starts this ball rolling, he has no control over it,'' said
Bryson, whose center provides support and legal research to
attorneys representing low-income people with housing problems.
   ``The further you get away from the secretary himself, the more
likely that you will have an abuse of power ... the greater your
chance is that you'll hit somebody who is blinded by the message
that we have to get these people out and will do anything to get
them out,'' Bryson said.
   Kemp also announced Tuesday that HUD is proposing new
regulations for Section 8 rent subsidies. Under the proposal, those
convicted of drug-related or violent crimes and evicted from public
housing will not be allowed to use Section 8 vouchers for other
rental property.
   Albright said the regulations should be sent to the Office of
Management and Budget today and should be published in the Federal
Register next month.
   Although Congress specifically identified leaseholds as
forfeitable assets in the 1988 anti-drug measure, the seizure
procedure was available earlier to enterprising government
officials, Bryson said. The New York City Housing Authority made
its first seizure of a public housing lease in April 1987.
   Albright said the new program will be ``a nationwide hit to
raise the consciousness of drug dealers and of the public that this
is something we can use and we intend to use.''

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Smoking-Education Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved a bill today boosting the federal role in educating
Americans about dangers of smoking.
   The bill, approved on a 10-4 vote, authorizes $110 million next
year for expanding research into the smoking habit, encouraging
states to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to
minors, and attempting to reduce smoking by target groups,
including pregnant women and blue-collar workers.
   The legislation would allow the government to buy anti-smoking
advertisements.
   Before the bill was approved, the committee stripped away
several contentious provisions, including one that would have
required labels warning that smoking is addictive. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the subcomittee, said those
provisions may be restored when the Senate debates the bill.
   ``Despite considerable progress in reducing smoking rates
throughout the country, tobacco products account for one-sixth of
all deaths every year,'' Kennedy said. ``Too many people _
especially young people _ have not yet received the message about
the dangers of smoking.
   ``The bill ... will be a major step forward in our ongoing
battle to inform the public and reduce the high toll of death and
disability that smoking inflicts on our society,'' Kennedy said.

<HEAD>Former Associated Press Reporter at NY City Hall Dead at 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POINT PLEASANT, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casper J. Schoener, reporter for The
Associated Press at City Hall in New York for the latter third of a
44-year career, died today at the age of 74.
   Schoener, who lived in Lakewood, died at the Medical Center of
Ocean County.
   In 39 years with AP, and five years before that in the old City
News Association, Schoener covered police, labor and political
news. He also for a time worked the ship-reporter beat, which in
the era before television and jet air travel produced social and
show-biz tidbits.
   He took over full-time responsibility for covering City Hall in
1966 during Mayor John V. Lindsay's administration.
   He was known to fellow reporters and the mayors he wrote about
as ``Joe Schroder'' or ``Schroeder,'' the name by which he called
himself, although he used the byline C.J. Schoener.
   ``By dint of knowledge and personality, he guided colleagues
through the many mazes of government,'' a colleague, Clyde
Haberman, wrote in The New York Times in 1981, a few months after
Schoener retired. ``Inevitably, his perceptions _ and they were
perceptions, not biases _ were those absorbed by newspaper readers
and television viewers.''
   He was the AP's lead reporter on events as diverse as the
protracted newspaper strikes of the 1960s, the parade for astronaut
John Glenn, the fiscal crisis of the 1970s and the blossoming of
Mayor Edward I. Koch as a celebrity. For a number of years he also
dictated the story eagerly awaited at newspapers around the
country, the annual Pulitzer Prize journalism awards.
   Mayors Koch, Lindsay and Abraham Beame showed up to offer
tributes at his retirement party.
   But Schoener once said that to cover government well, ``it isn't
that necessary to know the big people. Be nice to the secretaries.
Everything has to go through a typewriter.''
   He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Peggy, sons William and
John, and daughters Marie and Margaret.

   Guards surrounded government buildings in
the secessionist republic of Estonia today after Soviet loyalists
converged on parliament in what the premier called a failed ``coup
attempt.''
   Lawmakers in neighboring Lithuania began a closed-door debate on
new proposals designed to end an impasse with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Calm was reported in all three Baltic
republics.
   In Moscow, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he would
press Soviet leaders to explain why they have not begun talks with
Baltic leaders. Baker is on a four-day visit to make progress on
arms control before Gorbachev and President Bush meet in Washington
this month.
   In the Latvian capital, Riga, about two dozen pro-independence
demonstrators stood outside parliament, holding a banner that shows
a cow made up of the national colors of the three Baltic republics
and a figure of Gorbachev sucking on the udder. The also held
Latvian flags.
   Anti-independence protesters in Estonia threatened a general
strike May 21 unless their demands are met by Thursday, according
to Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow. They want the
immediate resignation of the republic's government, a referendum on
Esotnian secession from the Soviet Union and abolition of the
resolution on the national status of Estonia.
   A pro-independence newspaper, The Estonian Independent, reported
that Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told Baker in a
telegram about Tuesday's attempts by Moscow loyalists to occupy
Estonian government buildings.
   Savisaar told Baker the Estonian government ``would be deeply
surprised were the incidents in Estonia and Latvia not to find
reverberation'' in today's talks.
   A crowd estimated at up to 6,000 swarmed around Estonia's
parliament building in the republic's capital, Tallinn, on Tuesday.
Savisaar broadcast an appeal for citizens to ``Come here to save
Estonia!''
   ``There is a coup attempt here,'' he said in the broadcast,
which was monitored in Moscow and transcribed by the ETA Estonian
news agency in Tallinn.
   Thousands of Tallinn residents rushed to the parliament and
replaced the red Soviet flag with the traditional blue, white and
black banner that was raised last week when the legislature
restored a 1937 independence charter.
   Pro-independence demonstrators formed two human chains through
which Soviet loyalists were allowed to leave the area, ETA reported.
   Calm returned to the city by 7:50 p.m., Estonian reports said.
Finnish television said pro-independence crowds remained around
government broadcasting stations during the night to block any
takeover attempt.
   People's Front security guards were stationed around the clock
at other government buildings, ETA reported. ETA estimated the
Moscow loyalists at 2,500 and put pro-independence forces at 3,000.
Finnish TV estimated the pro-independence crowd at 5,000-6,000 and
the secessionist demonstrators at 20,000. The incident lasted just
over two hours.
   The Estonian Independent said the Estonian government late
Tuesday decided to set up a ``Home Guard'' of civilian volunteers
to protect official buildings. So far, the buildings have been
guarded by members of the People's Front, a grass-roots political
group.
   A similar confrontation occurred Tuesday in the Latvian capital
of Riga, where for the second day whistling and jeering Soviet
soldiers tried to muscle into the parliament building but were
blocked by pro-independence crowds.
   It was unclear whether the disturbances in Estonia and Latvia
were coordinated from Moscow or organized by local Soviet loyalists.
   The presidents of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania asked Bush and
Gorbachev in letters over the weekend to discuss the Baltics at
their summit and to support their independence moves.
   Gorbachev has called the Baltic republics' independence
declarations illegal and has imposed economic sanctions against
Lithuania, which declared its independence from Moscow on March 11.
   Latvia declared May 4 that it was passing through a transition
period to independence. Estonia had taken a similar step March 30.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned of
``anarchy'' in the Baltic republics, which were forcibly annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``The right to self-determination has to be implemented within
the framework of our constitution. If this principle is violated,
then it will mean anarchy, I am sure,'' Shevardnadze said in an
interview with CBS.
   In Moscow, radicals at the opening of the Russian republic's
congress said today they want to take over the republic's affairs
from the national government and elect a rival of Gorbachev as
their president.
   Some lawmakers demand that Russia secede from the U.S.S.R., the
state news agency Tass reported. The republic contains 52 percent
of the Soviet Union's population and three-quarters of its land.

   Government officials say they're moving to
boost airline security as recommended by a commission on the 1988
downing of Pan Am Flight 103, but won't immediately cancel plans to
install new bomb-detecting devices criticized by the panel.
   The report released Tuesday sharply criticized the Federal
Aviation Administration and others charged with protecting U.S. air
travelers. It called on the government to consider ``preemptive or
retaliatory military strikes'' against terrorist enclaves in other
countries to combat air terrorism.
   ``It's time to punish anyone we can prove took our aircraft
down,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a member of the
seven-person panel.
   For families of the victims, who sought formation of the
commission against what they called government indifference, the
report marked a victory.
   ``For many of us, it's been the most satisfying day since Dec.
21, 1988,'' when the plane was bombed over Lockerbie, Scotland,
said Bert Ammerman, organizer of the Victims of Pan Am 103.
   ``All the areas and recommendations are an endorsement of what
we've been asking for,'' said Ammerman, whose brother Thomas was
killed in the Pan Am crash.
   The President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism
criticized the FAA, the State Department and Pan American World
Airways and recommended major reforms in handling threats to air
safety.
   The panel called for a system to notify passengers of credible
terrorist threats and said the government should take more
seriously the possibility of terrorist strikes in the United States.
   ``We're pledged to continue to pursue this,'' said Lautenberg,
adding that if the recommendations were not enacted through federal
regulations, ``then we're going to be on the Senate floor putting
them into place.''
   White House and Transportation Department officials said they
would consider implementing some of the recommendations that are
not already in the works.
   The FAA ``is doing everything it can to ensure that traveling on
U.S. airlines is one of the safest and secure ways to travel in the
world,'' said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in a
statement.
   His statement was accompanied by a list of steps the department
has taken since the Pan Am crash and he added, ``more are under way
that we believe reflect the commission's recommendations.''
   FAA Administrator James Busey said he would continue with plans
to use six sophisticated Thermal Neutron Analysis (TNA) machines
the FAA has already contracted to purchase but will await the
results of studies before deciding whether to change plans for
broader installation.
   The commission asked that an order requiring airlines to
purchase and install the units at high-risk airports be deferred
until they can be proved to be more effective in detecting small
amounts of plastic explosives.
   FAA units already are operating in New York and Miami and one is
being installed in London. The commission said the machines, as
currently being operated, likely would not have detected the
Lockerbie bomb. But it recommended going ahead with installation of
the first six for testing purposes.
   Some relatives of victims said they disagreed with the proposal
to halt installation of the devices.
   The commission said the Lockerbie disaster, in which 270 people
on the plane and on the ground died, ``may well have been
preventable.''
   And it said the federal effort to ensure aviation safety ``is
seriously flawed and has failed to provide the proper level of
protection.''
   ``Without doubt, the FAA's performance was nothing short of
dismal,'' said one commission member, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   Commissioners recommended creating a position of assistant
secretary of transportation for aviation security and intelligence.
   Busey said he welcomed the suggestion for organizational
changes, but chafed at ``some of the adjectives used to describe
the FAA.''
   ``The system was flawed. Mistakes were made. I want to own up to
those mistakes,'' said Busey, who took over the FAA several months
after the bombing. He said the agency has taken significant steps
to improve security but ``we have more work to do.''
   The report recommended ``a more vigorous U.S. policy that not
only pursues and punishes terrorists but also makes state sponsors
of terrorism pay a price for their actions.''
   The report recommended ``planning and training for pre-emptive
or retaliatory military strikes against known terrorist enclaves in
nations that harbor them.
   ``Where such direct strikes are inappropriate, the commission
recommends a lesser option, including covert operations, to
prevent, disrupt or respond to terrorist acts.''
   The White House declined to comment on specific recommendations.
   ``We certainly agree that we need to be as aggressive as
necessary to fight terrorism,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said he disagreed with some of
the commission's criticisms of the airline but said the report made
several positive recommendations.
   The report strongly criticized Pan Am for security flaws at
Frankfurt's airport, where Flight 103 originated.
   In a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post and The New
York Times, Pan Am said the U.S. government and other governments
``have not provided meaningful support in combating terrorism
directed against civil aviation.''
   Pan Am called for establishment of a uniform international
standard of procedures for airline security, adding that money from
the Federal Aviation Trust Fund could be used to help implement
such a program.

   Millions of children have grown up with ``Sesame Street,'' which
is seen in more than 80 countries. It has 15 international
co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English. The program initially was intended to assist inner-city
children, but its popularity has far transcended that.
   Henson later produced ``The Muppet Show,'' which was broadcast
from 1975 through 1981. A Saturday morning cartoon, ``The Muppet
Babies,'' is currently airing.
   ``The Muppet Show'' became the most widely seen television
program in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices in April Rise 0.2 Percent</HEAD>

   Falling costs for vegetables, fuel oil and
women's clothing helped hold consumer price inflation to 0.2
percent in April, the government said today.
   It was the smallest increase since September and the first
moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices spiraling 1.1
percent in January. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index had
risen 0.5 percent in both February and March.
   ``We're correcting from the unusually high prices of the
winter,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State
University. ``... You could argue the worst of inflation is behind
us, certainly for this year.''
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing
starts plummeted 5.8 percent in April to their lowest level since
the 1982 recession. It was the third drop in a row.
   Interest rates, reacting to the evidence of quiescent inflation
and anemic economic growth, inched lower in early trading on the
bond market.
   The inflation number was expected but the housing number was
not. Together, the reports were taken as a sign the Federal Reserve
would have no need to raise rates to battle inflation.
   However, even with the April improvement, inflation for the
first four months of the year was running at a 6.8 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 4.6 percent for all of
1989.
   In April, food and beverage prices fell 0.2 percent, the first
decline since July 1987. Non-alcoholic beverages and dairy products
were down, while prices rose for cereal and bakery products, beef,
pork, sweets and oils.
   Fresh vegetable prices, which rose 29.2 percent in the first two
months of the year, fell 15.5 percent last month, bringing the
decline for April and March to 19.8 percent.
   Energy prices dropped 0.4 percent after declining the two
previous months. Gasoline prices, with the start of the warm
weather driving season, climbed 0.3 percent and electricty costs
were up 0.2 percent. However, fuel oil fell 0.6 percent, the third
consecutive decline, while natural gas dropped 3.0 percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
moderate 0.2 percent after rising a worrisome 0.7 percent in March.
Economists say this ``core'' number is often a better indicator of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   New automobile prices fell 0.2 percent in April. Clothing price
inflation moderated from a month earlier. Apparel prices overall
were unchanged after rising 1.7 percent in March.
   Women's and girls' clothing costs fell 0.5 percent. However,
men's and boys' clothing costs were up 0.4 percent while infants'
and toddlers' costs rose 1.9 percent.
   Health care costs rose a steep 0.8 percent, the third increase
in a row at that level. They were up 8.9 percent from a year ago.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
128.9 in April. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $128.90 last month, up
from $123.10 a year earlier.
   Separately, the department said Americans' average weekly
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased 0.2 percent last
month. However, over the past year, real weekly earnings were down
1.7 percent.
   So far this year, wholesale prices as measured by the
government's Producer Price Index have recovered from the winter
weather shocks much more swiftly than consumer prices. As a result,
wholesale prices for the first four months of the year have risen
at a more moderate annual rate of 4.2 percent.
   Analysts attribute the slower recovery of consumer prices to the
heavy influence of the service sector, which accounts for slightly
more than 50 percent of the consumer index and none of the
wholesale index.
   The economic slowdown of recent months has slowed demand for
goods, pulling down wholesale costs, but until very recently it
hasn't affected employment.
   Economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. said sluggishness in the goods-producing sector of the economy
may finally be spreading to services.
   ``I think we're breaking the upward trend of inflation that was
introduced earlier in the year,'' he said.
   Despite the first-quarter surge, Brusca forecasts an increase in
consumer prices for all of 1990 of about 4.3 percent.
   Other analysts, however, are less optimistic. The consensus of
51 top economists surveyed earlier thAs month by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., called for a 4.7 percent rise.
   Brusca argued that the improvement in inflation will be enough
to allow the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth with
lower interest rates. Policymakers for the central bank met behind
closed doors Tuesday, and many economists predicted they would hold
monetary policy steady until clearer evidence emerges of the
economy's direction.

   Environmental officials from 34 countries
today approved a declaration that calls for protecting the world's
ecology, but they shied away from making recommendations to deal
with specific problems.
   The United States stalled several proposals it considered too
costly or unattinable, including one for a new international fund
to help developing countries.
   Chief U.S. delegate John A. Knauss expressed satisfaction with
the outcome of the environmental conference and the declaration.
   ``I believe the way the document is written should not cause
concern over rising taxes,'' he said.
   But environmentalists criticized it as vague and watered down.
   Greenpeace, the international environmental group, said in a
statement that the conference's failure to agree on actions for
specific problems ``sends out an ominous signal to the rest of the
world.''
   It referred to the meeting as the ``Bergen fiasco.''
   The U.S. delegation conceded a major issue when it agreed to the
so-called precautionary principle, which calls for measures to
protect the environment even when scientific proof of their benefit
is lacking.
   ``Future policies should take the precautionary principle into
consideration. Scientific uncertainties should not prevent concrete
measures to limit environmental destruction,'' the document said.
   The Americans and most East bloc nations also objected to
setting new targets for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions. They
advised waiting until a U.N. report on global climate change is
published this fall.
   The declaration issued a general call for building more public
transportation systems, help for Eastern Europe and the Third World
in cleaning up its environment and better labeling of products.
   The United States refused to approve new funds for ozone
research and protection, and the document only called on each
country to take appropriate action.

<HEAD>Spraying Begins Against Mexican Fruit Fly; Angry Mayor Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when it seemed aerial spraying against
the Medfly would be winding down, Los Angeles County supervisors
have paved the way for spraying against a new pest _ the Mexfly.
   Supervisors voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency to
give the county legal immunity in the event of accidents and
lawsuits related to anti-Mexfly malathion spraying, which is being
overseen by the state.
   The vote came hours before helicopters sprayed malathion over a
57-square-mile area encompassing suburban Compton and South Gate
overnight to eradicate Mexflies. Officials discovered two Mexican
fruit flies in Compton on May 3 and May 8.
   After another helicopter spraying in two weeks, officials plan
to release sterile laboratory-bred Mexflies in the area to stop
breeding.
   The Mexican fruit fly attacks more than 40 types of fruit,
primarily citrus and stone fruit. The fly is established in Mexico,
parts of Central America and in Texas' lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Supervisor Ed Edelman, who voted against the emergency decree,
questioned the state's eradication strategy.
   ``I'm wondering if it makes sense to embark on the same
(eradication) program on the Mexican fruit fly which hasn't worked
as it was supposed to on the Medfly,'' Edelman said. ``I think it's
time to move on to other strategies.''
   Gov. George Deukmejian signed declarations of emergency Monday
for Los Angeles and San Diego counties to authorize the pesticide
missions. Several Mexflies also have been found in El Cajon, east
of San Diego.
   Meanwhile, other cities on Tuesday continued their fight to stop
pesticide spraying against the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   Los Angeles, Glendale and Burbank will fight a motion by the
state to have a judge from another county hear a lawsuit that seeks
to stop spraying, an attorney said Tuesday.
   The state's motion is an attempt to obtain a judge from an
agricultural area more sympathetic to the aerial pesticide spraying
program, said Keith Pritsker, Los Angeles deputy city attorney.
   Los Angeles and the two neighboring cities filed the suit in
February.
   The Medfly affects more than 250 varieties of fruit and
vegetables and, state officials say, threatens California's
multibillion-dollar farm economy.
   Critics claim more research is needed into malathion's possible
health effects. State agricultural officials counter the amount of
malathion being sprayed poses no health threat.

   Jim Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, Miss
Piggy and the other Muppet characters, died today at a hospital. He
was 53.
   Henson died at 1:30 a.m. from a massive bacterial infection,
Kathleen Robinson, a spokeswoman at New York Hospital, said. Henson
was admitted to the hospital Tuesday, she said. Hospital officials
would say nothing else this morning.
   Friends praised Henson's humanity and his abilities to educate
and entertain children.
   ``He could make you laugh while you're crying,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television in Cambridge,
Mass.
   ``I never met a kindler, gentler wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for Walt Disney Co. Henson's puppets grew into an industry, much of
which was purchased by Disney for a reported price of $100 million
to $150 million.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world. He was a giant in the entertainment industry,'' Okun
said.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954 and they debuted on a local
Washington, D.C., television program ``Sam and Friends,'' which won
a local Emmy in 1959.
   During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe appeared regularly on
``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' But Henson's
biggest break came when his characters appeared on the public
television hit ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Henson was the voice of Kermit, one of the most popular of his
creations. His work with the Muppets earned him a variety of
awards, from a Peabody award for excellence in television
programming to a Grammy for a Muppet album.
   Henson's other creations included The Cookie Monster, Oscar the
Grouch and Miss Piggy. Henson's shop brought the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles to the screen, where they became the nation's
top-grossing movie.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' regular, said, ``Not only was
Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   Henson's sudden death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street''
in the last year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the
popular children's series, died last year at age 52. A tribute to
Raposo was scheduled to air tonight. Former cast member Northern
Calloway also died recently.
   Millions of children have grown up with ``Sesame Street,'' which
is seen in more than 80 countries. It has 15 international
co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English. The program initially was intended to assist inner-city
children, but its popularity far transcended that.
   Henson produced ``The Muppet Show,'' which was broadcast from
1975 through 1981. It became the most widely seen television
program in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries.
   A Saturday morning cartoon, ``The Muppet Babies,'' is currently
airing.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936. He
married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five children.
   The family said plans for a memorial service would be announced
later.

<HEAD>Slovenia Establishes First Regional Non-Communist Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The northern state of Slovenia
today established the first regional non-Communist government in
Yugoslavia in almost 50 years and announced plans to abolish its
secret police.
   Premier-elect Lojze Peterle, head of Slovenia's Christian
Democratic Party, also said Slovenia would strive to form its own
army, westernize its Communist-style police force and seek greater
autonomy.
   ``We will press for a confederation in Yugoslavia, based on the
freely expressed will of its peoples,'' Peterle said in his
inaugural speech to Parliament. He added without elaboration that
this would be done ``through constitutional means.''
   Peterle told the state legislature he had succeeded in forming a
Cabinet supported by DEMOS, a six-party coalition that won last
month's first free elections. The legislature subsequently approved
his Cabinet.
   Among new Cabinet members is Janez Jansa, a prominent former
anti-Communist dissident who was sentenced to 18 months in jail in
1988 for allegedly revealing military secrets. He was elected
Slovenia's new defense minister.
   All the parties within DEMOS, the largest of which are the
Christian Democrats, will be represented in the new 27-member
government, Alenka Leskovec, a parliamentary spokeswoman said in an
interview.
   Debate on whether the Yugoslav federation of six republics and
two provinces should be turned into a looser confederation of
states cooperating voluntarily has pitted Slovenia and neighboring
Croatia against Serbia, whose hard-line Communist leadership favors
a strong central government.
   During the election campaign DEMOS had demanded that Slovenia
proclaim its full sovereignty and secede from Yugoslavia, but after
its victory the coalition has backed off from demanding full
independence.
   Multiparty elections have also been held in Croatia, where a
center-right government is due to be officially installed at the
end of May after the ruling Communists were defeated.
   Except for Serbia, all other member states also have scheduled
free elections. Serbia's Communist authorities have not yet
legalized opposition parties and have opposed the introduction of
Western-style democracy.
   In his inaugural speech, Peterle said Slovenia's large financial
contribution to the federal government ``was stifling economic
growth'' in his republic, Yugoslavia's most prosperous region. He
also urged that funding be reduced, particularly for the military
budget.
   Yugoslavia's influential and Communist-dominated armed forces
have long been at odds with Slovenia over that republic's demands
for less military meddling in the country's political life.
   Slovene politicians and the region's media have in the past
repeatedly accused the army leadership of being under the sway of
Serbia's hard-line Communist authorities.
   ``Changes will have to be implemented in the military-defense
field,'' Peterle declared, adding that his government would strive
for an ``independent Slovene army.''
   He also said the republic's Communist-style police force would
be remodeled along Western lines and that the ``secret political
police'' would be abolished.

   Soldiers with automatic weapons
occupied the international airport today and demanded the
government send the army commander to negotiate better pay and
clothing allowances.
   Other soldiers commandeered taxis and government cars for joy
rides around the capital, some standing up through sunroofs waving
at passers-by. Roadblocks were set up by the rebellious soldiers,
and people, particularly those traveling in government cars, were
pulled out and questioned.
   Many stores and banks closed, and the U.S. Embassy advised
Americans to stay indoors and not travel around the city.
   The airport was closed and empty, save for soldiers and customs
inspectors.
   Government television carried a communique calling on the
soldiers to lay down their weapons and return to their barracks but
gave no indication it would try to crush the mutiny.
   It was the latest in a series of protests that began when the
government, unable to pay its foreign debt and having trouble
meeting its own payrolls, tried to impose austerity measures in
March.
   Violent protests, which included the first public calls for
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to retire, forced the government
to close schools and suspend the austerity measures.
   Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving president, also gave
in to demands to permit opposition parties to form for the first
time since Ivory Coast gained independence from France in 1960.
   The soldiers at the airport, members of the air force, said they
wanted to to see Gen. Felix Orly, the army commander, because the
defense minister had betrayed them. They said they would kill the
minister, Charles Konan Bany, if he approached the airport.
   Other soldiers occupied the national television station, the
second such protest in two days. On Monday soldiers entered the
building and demanded a meeting with Houphouet-Boigny to demand
better pay and allowances.
   Houphouet-Boigny met with them and promised to take action
immediately. But soldiers outside the airport said Bany and other
ministers later convinced the president it wasn't necessary to meet
their demands.
   The soldiers blocked the road into the airport with big cement
blocks and waved down anyone who tried to enter.
   Two reporters who were allowed past a roadblock and into the
airport were chased away by soldiers who appeared to be leaders of
the occupation.
   ``This is between we Ivorians and is none of your business,''
one said.
   At a roadblock on the outskirts of the airport other soldiers,
carrying loaded weapons, said they were only being paid $14 a month
and that they had to buy their uniforms and shoes. They showed
reporters tears in their uniforms and holes in their shoes.
   The soldiers claimed the defense minister had become a
millionaire by taking money due them. They also claimed that
millions of dollars had been collected for a fund set up last year
to combat security problems in the country but they had not seen a
cent of it.
   The soldiers, asked whether they would accept new promises to
improve their conditions, said: ``We keep our weapons with us 24
hours a day. We know where these ministers live. We guard them. We
can kill them.''

   Water from a swollen reservoir roared
through floodgates in an ever more powerful flow today as the first
flood crest reached the dam, threatening to swamp 200 square miles
of southeastern Texas.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a disaster
area Tuesday by President Bush. On the Red River, which climbed
toward a 45-year high, National Guardsmen worked to shore up a
weakened levee protecting the town of Garland.
   In Louisiana, Gov. Buddy Roemer flew over flooded regions of his
state today to check out damage caused by the Red River. Col. Frank
Skidmore of the Army Corps of Engineers told him 700,000 acres of
farms and woods would be inundated by the muddy water.
   Elsewhere, heavy rain pelted water-logged central and southern
Illinois overnight, causing flooding that forced the evacuation of
several families in Vermilion and Macon counties.
   In Washington, the Federal Emergency Management Agency today
extended a presidential disaster area to four more Texas counties,
making a total of 33 counties eligible for government assistance
because of severe weather and flooding since April 15.
   The Trinity River in Texas was carrying flood crests from
torrential rain two weeks ago in the Dallas area and from heavy
rain last week upriver near Crockett. The first of the crests
crossed Lake Livingston today as the water flowed southward.
   ``This is the front end of it. This is just the beginning,''
said Liberty County emergency management coordinator Jim Mitchum.
   The water released from the Lake Livingston Dam flooded areas
where some 7,000 residents were warned to evacuate. It was the
worst flooding in Texas in 80 years.
   The Trinity River Authority released water at a record rate of
88,000 cubic feet per second Tuesday and today through the gates of
the dam.
   Discharges later today were likely to pass 90,000 cubic feet,
and the 100,000 level was expected by Monday, said Grady Manis, the
authority's southern region manager. He said that level was likely
to be sustained for six to eight days.
   Roads leading into more than 15 subdivisions in wooded areas
along the river in Liberty County were already covered with water.
   Although many homes probably will have some flood damage,
Mitchum said he does not expect entire subdivisions to be wiped out
by the heavy current.
   ``We will not be washed down the Trinity River into the Gulf (of
Mexico),'' he added.
   Manis said he expected the worst flooding on Monday.
   ``Below Lake Livingston Dam, there's about 990 square miles.
Maybe 20 percent of that is probably going to be underwater at the
height of this.''
   The area threatened is about 50 miles south of the dam and 60
miles northeast of Houston. Many residents heeded early warnings
and moved to higher ground. Some of those who chose to stay lost
their nerve and called for help.
   ``Now they've become frightened and they want out,'' said Jim
Mitchum, Liberty County emergency management coordinator.
   Heavy rain in past weeks also caused flooding in Oklahoma and
Kansas.
   The flooding has been blamed for one death in Oklahoma and 13 in
Texas, including a 25-year-old cleanup worker swept away Tuesday
near Texarkana.
   The Red River sent water deeper over Louisiana cropland today
but officials said it may have crested in Shreveport earlier and
lower than expected.
   The Red crested Tuesday at Shreveport at 34.5 feet, nearly a
foot below the crest initially predicted for today and 4.5 feet
above flood stage. The difference was attributed to better
absorption of water upstream and less than expected effects from
recent rain in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   ``The worst is over, but we're not quite out of the woods yet,''
said Ernest Ethridge, chief meteorologist at the National Weather
Service in Shreveport.
   ``It's the worst flood we've had here in my lifetime,'' said
Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who toured the region.
   The water had forced 225 people out of their homes in the
Shreveport-Bossier City area of northwestern Louisiana. An
additional 135 were flooded out downstream in Rapides, Natchitoches
and Red River parishes.
   The Red River in Arkansas began to abate on Tuesday, and
officials said they could concentrate on cleaning up. In Kansas
City, daylong downpours caused creeks and rivers to overflow and
forced hundreds of people from their homes.
   ``We've been saying that this was going to be a truly
devastating flood, and it looks like it will be,'' said Judge
Dempsie Henley in Liberty County. ``We don't have any historical
data to compare what the damages and losses could be.''
   At the Rattlesnake Ranch in Houston County, part-owner and
manager John Merriwether estimated losses in cattle, homes, fences
and property will exceed $1 million. Statewide agriculture losses
have been put at $500 million.
   ``We lost cattle, but how many cattle, we don't know,'' said
Merriwether. ``Probably a lot of them are floating now.''

   The investigation into the assassination of
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy should be reopened to look at the mystery of
one or more extra bullets, say scholars who have studied the
massive files.
   The demand to reopen the Kennedy case coincides with tonight's
airing of NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which re-examines the
second-gun theory in the midst of the May ratings sweeps period.
   Gregory Stone, a political scientist who spent nearly two years
studying material from state archives, said Tuesday it is possible
that at least nine bullets and perhaps as many as 12 were fired in
the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel on the night of June 5, 1968,
when Kennedy was slain.
   The convicted assassin, Sirhan B. Sirhan, carried a .22-caliber
revolver that held eight bullets.
   ``After 22 years, it is not acceptable to allow fundamental
questions to remain unanswered about the murder of one of the
greatest public figures of our time,'' Stone told a news conference.
   ``Significant new evidence has recently surfaced suggesting that
more shots may have been fired during the assassination of Sen.
Robert Kennedy than could have been discharged by Sirhan Sirhan
acting alone,'' he said.
   Stone called for the Los Angeles County District Attorney and
the County Board of Supervisors to reopen the investigation.
   The so-called second gun theory has haunted the Kennedy case for
years, raising persistent speculation that someone else in the
pantry fired shots that night.
   The researchers did not speculate on who a second gunman might
have been.
   Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for the Police Department, said
the second-gun theory was thoroughly explored by investigators. He
dismissed Stone's allegations as a rehash of old material.
   ``There are no plans to reopen the investigation. `Unsolved
Mysteries' is reviving the how-many-guns theory. They haven't
presented anything that hasn't been presented before,'' Booth said.
   Kennedy was hit three times, and five other bullets hit
bystanders who survived, police have said. Seven of the bullets
were recovered.
   Others appearing at the news conference included author Dan
Moldea, Philip Melanson, a professor and author, former FBI Agent
William Bailey and David Mendelsohn, a TV producer who has
researched the case.
   New evidence cited by the group included Moldea's recent
interviews with five police officers involved in the investigation
who said they remembered seeing bullet holes in a door frame which
has since been destroyed. Some said they heard that bullets were
removed from the frame.

   Freed American hostage Robert Polhill has a
cancerous growth on his left vocal cord and his entire larynx _
voice box _ will be removed by surgeons on Thursday, doctors at
Walter Reed Army Hospital said today.
   Polhill was released by his Shiite Moslem captors in Lebanon on
April 22, and has spent most of the time since at Walter Reed. His
raspy voice prompted an early discovery of the tumor, which proved
malignant in biopsy tests, according to Col. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy
commander of the hospital.
   Polhill's wife, Ferial, and his mother, Ruth Polhill, were at
Zajtchuk's side when the announcement was made. Polhill remained in
his room.
   Polhill ``will have a recovery period of about 14 days, and then
will be discharged, and then will come back for a course or
radiation therapy,'' said Jim Stueve, hospital spokesman.
   Stueve said Polhill, 55, already has been working with a speech
therapist to learn ways to communicate after his larynx is removed.
He said there are ``three or four options'' for that, including use
of an electronic device which emulates the voice box.
   The spokesman said the prospects for Polhill living a full life
after the surgery are ``good.''
   ``He has a very positive attitude,'' Stueve said.

<HEAD>Senate Lifts Helms Roadblock, Moves to Vote on AIDS Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 6 grafs new with debate resuming, similar House bill
awaits action; picks up 6th graf pvs, The Senate agreed.</NOTE>

   The Senate, pushing aside objections by Sen.
Jesse Helms, is moving toward a vote on a $600-million-a-year bill
to help states and cities cope with the costs of AIDS.
   Passage was assured, both sides said, as more than two-thirds of
the Senate's members, 67, were cosponsors of the bill.
   The Senate voted 95-3 on Tuesday to limit debate, a procedural
step made necessary to proceed after Helms, R-N.C., erected
parliamentary roadblocks.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, tentatively scheduled
a vote for today as the Senate resumed considering amendments.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., called the overwhelming vote
Tuesday a clear signal the Senate intends to approve the measure.
   A similar bill was approved by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee and awaits floor action. It contains some different
provisions and would authorize the spending of more than $800
million a year.
   The Senate agreed to a series of amendments to the bill,
including one dedicating it to Ryan White, who died April 8 at the
age of 18. His six-year struggle against the disease and the
discrimination it brought won him widespread attention and
admiration.
   ``The spirit of this brave and gallant young person is very much
a part of this legislation,'' Kennedy said.
   White's mother watched from the Senate gallery as the Senate
debated the bill. Jeanne White of Cicero, Ind., later said she was
angered by a charge by Helms that homosexuals were cynically
exploiting her son's death to push their own causes.
   ``I was very irate about it,'' she said.
   ``Ryan didn't feel like that at all. I felt he was putting words
in my mouth and in Ryan's mouth,'' she said. ``Ryan always felt he
did not blame anybody, so why should you.''
   White contracted the disease through a blood transfusion.
Homosexual contact and illegal intravenous drug injections are
primary methods of transmitting the disease.
   Helms, acknowledging his objections would be futile, charged
that too much money as being spent on AIDS at the expense of other
diseases, and that the money would encourage homosexuality.
   ``What originally began as a measured response to a public
health emergency has become a weapon, frankly, for the
deterioration if not the destruction of America's Judeo-Christian
value system,'' he said.
   Kennedy charged Helms with misrepresenting and distorting the
bill.
   The Senate agreed to an amendment requiring states or local
governments to receiving money under the measure to carry out what
they decide is an appropriate program of notification of partners
of people testing positively for the AIDS-causing virus.
   It rejected on a 65-33 vote an amendment offered by Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., that would let states with fewer than 100 cases of
AIDS to spend their share of the money on other diseases.
   Supporters of the bill criticized Helms' arguments that AIDS was
spread through ``immorality.''
   ``We don't reject the cancer patient who didn't try to stop
smoking,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Helms' home state of North Carolina is a major producer of
tobacco.
   Only Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Steven Symms, R-Idaho,
joined Helms in voting against the debate limitation.
   Supporters described the measure as emergency relief for
communities and public health systems overburdened by patients with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The bill provides $300 million for metropolitan areas with the
largest number of AIDS patients: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas;
Houston; Los Angeles; Miami; New York; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia;
San Francisco; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Washington, D.C.
   Those areas have reported 60 percent of the nation's AIDS cases,
sponsors said. The money would be used to care for AIDS patients
and for support programs.
   Another $300 million would go to states to develop comprehensive
AIDS care programs.

   Negotiators for El Salvador and the
nation's leftist guerrillas today began the first direct talks in
six months aimed at ending a 10-year-old war that has killed more
than 70,000 people.
   A U.N. mediator said there would be no time limit on the talks.
   ``One cannot solve a civil war overnight,'' mediator Alvaro de
Soto said Tuesday. Earlier peace talks were violently interrupted
in November after the bombing of leftist union hall that left 10
people dead.
   De Soto, who is representing U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, refused to say where the talks were being be held or to
disclose any other details.
   Delegates of both parties, along with the U.N. envoy, held a
working breakfast today with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez at the Miraflores Palace before the talks began.
   Possible locations were thought to include the Venezuelan island
navy base of La Orchila across the port of Caracas.
   De Soto said the talks would be held ``in the greatest possible
confidentiality. Don't expect too much from these direct talks,''
he told reporters.
   Salvadoran Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, who heads the
rightist government's delegation, met with Perez late Tuesday but
refused to reveal arrangements for the negotiations to reporters.
   ``All the people of El Salvador are fervently hoping that peace
will be reached in the shortest term,'' he said.
   The Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation will be
represented by a delegation headed by veteran guerrilla leader
Shafik Handal.
   According to reports from El Salvador, other representatives of
the government side included Col. Mauricio Vargas, who commands the
army's third brigade. No army representative has been a member of
the peace delegation since President Alfredo Cristiani was
inaugurated in May 1989.
   Cristiani's U.S.-backed government and the rebels signed a
preliminary agreement in Geneva on April 4 that set the framework
for new rounds of talks. It established as the main objectives
political accords leading to a cease-fire and ``respect for the
rights of the civilian population.''
   Most of the 71,000 killed in the war were civilians.
   This round of negotiations is the resumption of talks broken off
by the guerrillas following the union hall bombing in November.
   A few days later, the guerrillas launched a major offensive that
left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them in San Salvador. The
rebels withdrew after failing to defeat the army and without the
popular uprising the rebels had hoped to instigate in the capital.
   Rebel demands have moderated significantly in recent years. At
first they focused on sharing power and the integration of the
government and guerrilla armies. Now they stress democratic reforms
and a purge of army officers suspected of belonging to death squads.
   Cristiani seems to have accepted the idea that some high-ranking
officers will have to leave the ranks.
   A month ago, when Cristiani came to Caracas for talks with
Perez, he said he was willing to along with ``restructuring'' of
the army, but he was quick to defend it from any charges of death
squad involvement.

   A 17-year-old girl was forced into an apartment
and repeatedly raped in an attack that may have involved 10 to 15
teen-age boys, authorities said.
   Four boys ages 14 to 17 were ordered held Tuesday in the alleged
attack, and three more juveniles were taken into custody and
awaited court appearances today.
   Police said the girl had been roughed up on the street pushed
into the apartment Sunday night by three girls who wanted her
athletic shoes.
   The girl told police she was assaulted by as many as 50 young
men, but Children's Court Commissioner Thomas Cooper said police
reports on the four teen-agers who appeared before him indicated
the number was closer to 10 or 15.
   ``In 12 years this is the worst sexual assault I've had occasion
to come across,'' Cooper said in ordering the juveniles held.
   ``I don't see a tremendous credibility problem. I think this is
shaping up to be a strong case _ and certainly an extreme amount of
violence.''
   Police Lt. Robert Brandt said the victim's account is
corroborated by a witness and that there is no reason to doubt it.
   Brandt said statements by the victim indicated she and a
girlfriend were on a street when three other girls approached.
   ``One of the girls said something about wanting the tennis
shoes, the victim's tennis shoes,'' he said. ``They began to strike
the girl with their fists, spit on her and called her various
names.''
   They then forced her into an apartment, kicked her and poured
water on her, he said. The girls forced her into a bedroom where
several boys were, and ``there were multiple suspects committing
multiple acts of sexual assault,'' he said.
   He said the girl was allowed to leave after several hours.
Police said she suffered no serious physical injuries.

   The Communist Party boss in the central city of
Luoyang has been removed from his post for accepting bribes, the
official Workers' Daily said Wednesday.
   Party Secretary Wu Zhenguo was accused of accepting an air
conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine, clothes and bribes from
1985 to 1987, when he was the city's mayor, the report said.
   Guo Guosan, formerly vice secretary of the city, was appointed
to succeed Wu as party chief of Luoyang, an ancient city that was
once China's capital.
   Wu is one of several senior party or government officials
ensnared in a nationwide campaign to crack down on official
corruption. The widespread abuse of power by public officials was
one of the main issues during the student-led pro-democracy
demonstrations of a year ago.
   The newspaper said an investigation into Wu's actions was still
being conducted, implying that no criminal charges had been filed
against him.

   A man was pushed from a subway platform onto the
tracks less than 24 hours after a college student from Austria was
shoved in front of an oncoming train and narrowly escaped death,
Transit Authority police said. A man was arrested following the
second pushing early today when witnesses helped chase him down,
and investigators were trying to determine whether the two
incidents were connected, Transit police spokesman Al O'Leary said.
   Christa Neumann-Spallart, 26, of Vienna, Austria, suffered a
broken leg and a broken ankle in the fall from the elevated
platform in Queens early Tuesday, but saved herself by rolling into
a trough in the tracks, between the wheels of the approaching train.
   ``If you can be lucky and unlucky at the same time, this woman
was,'' said O'Leary.
   James Richardson, 36, of Queens suffered a head cut when he was
pushed from the platform at Rockefeller Center in mid-Manhattan.
His wound was treated by an ambulance crew after witnesses pulled
him back up onto the platform.
   Arrested and booked for investigation of reckless endangerment
and attempted robbery was Manuel Maleve, 35, of Brooklyn, O'Leary
said. The second charge was added because he allegedly tried to
grab an officer's gun.
   Maleve loosely fit the description of the man who pushed Ms.
Neumann-Spallart, but no positive identification was established by
mid-morning today, he said.
   Ms. Neumann-Spallart, a student at New York City Technical
College in Brooklyn, said a man who was sitting on a bench ``jumped
out and pushed her. She fell on the platform first, then tumbled
onto the track area,'' O'Leary said.
   The motorman saw her fall and was able to slow the train so that
only the front of one car passed over her, police said. She
suffered a bruised pelvis in addition to the broken bones, hospital
officials said.

   Gunmen perched on roofs and riding
speeding motorcycles shot six people overnight, bringing the death
toll in a two-day shooting spree to nine, police and hospital
officials said Wednesday.
   Authorities slapped a curfew on several sections of this central
city, which has been battered by ethnic violence for several years.
   No group claimed responsibility for the latest violence, but
police blamed a renegade faction of a militant Indian immigrant
party called the Mohajir Qami Movement.
   Supporters of the Mohajir group want to be recognized as a fifth
ethnic nationality behind Pathans, Baluch, Sindhis and Punjabis.
   Battles between the Mohajir group and supporters of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's party have left hundreds dead in the
southern port city of Karachi, about 100 miles south of Hyderabad.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   May 11
   Capital Journal, Pierre, S.D., on the family leave bill:
   The House of Representatives, which obviously has nothing better
to do, has decided to tell American business how to treat its
employees. ...
   (T)he House approved a bill that would guarantee unpaid leave of
up to 12 weeks for medical reasons or for the care of a new or ill
child, parent or spouse. The bill exempts businesses with fewer
than 50 workers.
   The bill passed despite a threatened veto by President Bush. Now
the bill goes to the Senate, where, hopefully, keener minds will
prevail.
   It's galling to see an outfit that can't balance a budget try to
tell the business community what's right for its employees.
Business and industry are swamped with federal red tape already.
Now the government is again mandating benefits and making life
tougher for people who keep this country working.
   Our lawmakers have to realize that they can't mandate America's
character as a kinder, gentler nation.

<TEXT>
   May 12
   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on the family leave bill:
   In the interests of supporting family values and an efficient
work force, President Bush should withdraw his threat to veto a
family leave bill. ...
   The federal bill, approved ... by the ... House, ... supports
several important economic and ethical issues. One is the now
obvious fact that our economy cannot function without the skills of
women workers and that many families cannot function without a
wife's paycheck.
   Anything that helps women work helps the economy. These economic
facts are beyond argument.
   At the same time, as President Bush and others have said many
times, we must encourage strong family relationships and help
couples who want a family but who might, in some circumstances,
choose abortion if having a child meant that the mother could not
work.
   Most of all, workers should be allowed to spend time at home to
care for a new baby or a sick relative. It is not only the humane
thing to do; it is the practical thing.
   Family leave is hardly likely to be exploited. Even with medical
benefits paid by a company, few employees could afford to remain
away from work longer than is absolutely necessary.

   Kenosha (Wis.) News on the family leave bill:
   Does George Bush ever rue the day his speechwriters came up with
the phrase ``kinder, gentler''? Probably not. He himself seems a
relatively kind and gentle man. But when he watches his political
opponents turn the slogan into a partisan club, there must be some
grinding of the presidential teeth.
   The White House announced the other day that it would veto a
``family leave'' bill now in Congress. The president's decision is
good public policy. But one of the bill's boosters immediately told
reporters: ``I can't believe the kinder, gentler president is going
to veto this bill.''
   It would be helpful if policy provisions were discussed
according to their merits rather than the moral make-up of the
person who holds them. Sadly, politics doesn't work that way. The
president should stick to his position nevertheless.

   The Newport (R.I.) Daily News on the hostage situation:
   Former hostage Frank Reed is starting to irritate us.
   Since his return to the United States after spending 3{ years in
captivity in Lebanon, Reed has kept officials off balance with his
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde comments.
   One day Reed says he understands and accepts the government's
handling of the hostage crisis; the next day he blasts the
president because he refuses to negotiate for the hostages still in
captivity. ...
   Reed must take some responsibility for his kidnapping. He was
abducted in Lebanon after the United States advised its citizens to
leave the Middle East because it could not guarantee their safety.
   Reed ignored the advice. He said he thought his conversion to
the Moslem faith would protect him.
   He was wrong.
   Now, after making a colossal blunder, Reed is trying to talk the
government into making another mistake. He wants the United States
to throw caution and its hostage policy to the wind and negotiate
for the six Americans still held hostage. ...
   Reed said he and four other hostages once ``had some not-so-nice
thoughts about people who we thought weren't willing to trade for
our lives.''
   Mr. Reed, those same people you are complaining about warned all
Americans to leave the Middle East. Why didn't you listen?

   Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal on secondhand smoke:
   The Environmental Protection Agency has fanned the flames of the
smoking debate with a comprehensive study on the hazards of
secondhand cigarette smoke.
   The study is about what you would expect: People who don't smoke
themselves but are exposed to cigarette smoke are at a greater risk
of dying from cancer or other smoking related diseases.
   The EPA draft report attributes 3,000 deaths annually to cancers
caused by secondhand smoke. Other illnesses cause more deaths.
Children of smokers are a particular concern.
   Reaction to this news also was predictable. The tobacco industry
said the study proved nothing. A Philip Morris official said the
report was based on 24 studies, 18 of which showed no danger from
secondhand smoke, and three showed that breathing other people's
cigarette smoke was actually good for you. Where do they get these
guys?
   The point is that even though the conclusions are preliminary,
the findings are good information from a good source that a danger
exists. And the report provides ammunition for anti-smoking groups,
employers and sympathetic lawmakers to extend regulation of smoking
in public areas and workplaces.

   The Santa Fe (N.M.) New Mexican on Bush's environmental policy:
   Environmental policy-making in the White House of late has
caused us to muse on that strange animal, the ostrich. An
ostrich-like posture (if you keep your head in the sand long enough
the problem with go away) allows the president to ignore the
compelling ecological signs that action must be taken now.
   Protection of the ozone layer is a leading case in point. Holes
in the ozone layer put us all at risk _ developed and developing
nations alike. Yet over the objections of Environmental Protection
Agency chief William K. Reilly, the Bush administration recently
welched on its commitment to put $20 million a year into a new
environmental fund for financial and technical assistance to
developing nations. This fund would help developing nations phase
out chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that deplete the
protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.
   Over the past 40 years, the United States has set an example for
the world. We've empowered many nations to do good things _ to
rebuild their shattered economies, to establish stable democracies.
The president should be providing global leadership on this and
other critical environmental issues, not sticking his head in the
sand.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Delta Commission
report:
   Even before the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission's
report gets a chance for a full airing, some critics ... have begun
to surface.
   They charge that the report wasn't worth the money it cost. So
far the commission has spent one and a half years and $2.4 million
in producing the 186-page report. The total could reach $3 million
by the time the commission goes out of existence Sept. 30.
   It's true that much of the depressing findings in the study of
this poverty-stricken area are well-known to the people who live
here: high rates of illiteracy and school dropouts; high
unemployment and a low per capita income; a heavy dependency on
federal welfare; high infant mortality rates and large areas of
substandard housing; too many unskilled workers and too few
high-paying jobs.
   But the critics at home miss the point. They and most of the
people who live in the seven-state region studied by the Delta
Commission are well aware of the problems. But a goal of the Delta
Commission was to convince President Bush and Congress, who don't
know the problems firsthand, that the Delta needs help from the
federal government.
   If the Delta Commission's report is to do more than gather dust,
it had to be persuasive and comprehensive. From what we've read
about the study, it is that. Not only does the report fully outline
the problems, but its 10-year economic development plan contains
more than 400 recommendations, many of which are steps the region
should take to help itself without any federal expenditures.
   We hope that the Delta Commission gets more than a sympathetic
ear from the president and Congress. In many respects parts of the
Delta are like the impoverished Third World nations of Asia, Africa
or South America. It doesn't make sense for this nation to send
foreign aid to help Third World nations while continuing to ignore
similar conditions in our own backyard.

   The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H., on the census:
   Should Americans living overseas be counted in the federal
census conducted nationwide every 10 years? ...
   We think for the sake of thoroughness, the Census Bureau ought
to make it possible for these folks to sign on in the national head
count. This should be worked out with U.S. Embassies abroad to make
their inclusion as simple as possible. ...
   If the Census Bureau can worry about the plumbing in U.S.
households, it can crank out yet another form for Americans living
abroad outside the military-government umbrella. It seems to be the
right thing to do for the sake of a complete count.

   The president sidestepped questions about whether he would
accept higher taxes. Bush campaign on a ``no new tax'' pledge, but
has said there are no preconditions in the deficit reduction talks
with Congress.
   Bush is scheduled to meet with Soviet President Gorbachev in
Washington in little more that two weeks, and Secretary of State
Baker was in Moscow today for a final round of pre-summit talks.
   Bush opened his news conference with an ``urgent appeal'' to
Congress to approve his request for millions of dollars in economic
aid to Nicaragua and Panama. He called on Congress to cancel a
planned Memorial Day recess next week to act on the legislation.
   The requests have been hung up in Congress for weeks, as
lawmakers have tripled the cost and added ``mischievous''
amendments, Bush said. ``Provisions that have absolutely nothing to
do with Nicaragua and Panama.''
   Later, in reply to a question, he said he would veto the aid
bill if Congress attached a provisioin liberalizing restrictions on
abortions.
   ``The situation in Nicaragua is absolutely critical,'' Bush
said. He said the government of Violetta Chamorro had asked for an
emergency briudge loan, but Bush said, ``I can't provide a loan''
anchored on legislation that is not assured.''

   Iranian and European Community officials
met today at Iran's request, raising modest hopes of progress
toward freeing Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Hussein Moussavian, Iran's top official on West European
affairs, made no comment as he arrived at medieval Dublin Castle to
meet officials from Ireland, France and Italy. There were no
statements issued after the meeting.
   The meeting was the first such gathering since Iran appointed an
ambassador to the European Community in March. An Irish Foreign
Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran
asked for the talks.
   Irish officials had said the talks were likely to focus on
Iran's wish to improve trade relations but that the Europeans would
bring up the plight of hostages believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem groups in Lebanon.
   The meeting, set to last two hours, went on for nearly three. It
was relatively low-level, involving Foreign Ministry political
directors _ Padraig Murphy of Ireland, Bertrand Dufourcg of France
and Enzo Perlot of Italy.
   Eight of the Westerners missing in Lebanon _ four Britons, a
dual British and Irish national, an Italian and two West Germans _
are from European Community states.
   Also missing are two Swiss Red Cross workers and six Americans,
including the longest-held hostage, Terry A. Anderson. Anderson,
the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Ireland has been increasing efforts for the release of dual
national Brian Keenan, a teacher seized in 1986.
   Former hostage Robert Polhill, an American who was held with
Keenan and British journalist John McCarthy before being freed last
month, says Keenan wants to be considered Irish and is highly
critical of Britain's policy of refusing to negotiate with
kidnappers.
   There had been speculation that if today's talks went well,
Britain and Iran would start direct talks abut the fate of Keenan,
McCarthy and Church of England envoy Terry Waite.
   Iran and Britain broke diplomatic relations in February 1989
after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for the death of British
author Salman Rushdie. Khomeini accused Rushdie of blaspheming
Islam in his novel, The Satanic Verses.
   Paul Cooper, brother of British businessman Roger Cooper, who
has been jailed without trial in Tehran for five years, arrived in
Dublin from Britain to appeal to Moussavian for his brother's
release.
   ``As far as my brother is concerned, there has been a great
miscarriage of justice,'' Cooper said.
   But he added: ``I don't blame Iran _ this type of thing can
happen anywhere.''

   Jakarta (Indonesia) Post on U.S. bases in the Philippines:
   Major developments taking place in the past few years _ caused
to a large degree by Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost
policies, and the strong desire of the U.S. Congress to reduce
military spending _ have significantly changed the cold war nature
of global politics. ...
   (They) unavoidably must have influenced the setting of the
negotiating meeting between the Philippines' delegation led by
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus and the U.S. Delegation led by
Washington's special negotiator Richard Armitage. ....
   For the Philippines it is clear that whatever the case, the
American bases will eventually have to go. It is not an expression
of excessive and belated nationalism to say that for an independent
and sovereign nation in Southeast Asia today, it would be
anachronistic to still cling to the view that it is necessary to
have foreign military base on its territory. ...
   What is lacking so far on the American side is the ability, or
willingness, to see the need for gradually phasing out the U.S.
presence in the Philippines within the larger context of a
comprehensive U.S. policy for Southeast Asia.

   The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on U.S. bases in the Philippines:
   There is more at stake in the talks (on U.S. bases in the
Philippines) than just the bases. In the rapidly changing world and
in the continuing crises of the Philippines, the inherent stability
the bases bring would be welcome. Thailand already is on record as
favoring continuation of a U.S. military presence in the region. ...
   Given the diminishing tension among the superpowers and the
growing trend of reduced military spending by many countries around
the world, a case can be argued in favor of phasing out Clark Air
Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   On the other side of the coin, a continued U.S. presence in the
Philippines can also be viewed in a positive light as a regional
security deterrent, useful until such time as peace and economic
cooperation between countries of differing political ideologies in
the region become firmly rooted. ...
   Striking a proper balance between these conflicting concerns is
not easy, but ... it could well be to the advantage of the
Philippines and the region as a whole for the Manila government to
negotiate a schedule that would allow the continuation of the bases
for another period of time before the eventual phasing out.

   The Sunday Telegraph, London, on South Africa:
   Is South Africa too important to be left to South Africans _
even black ones? The orthodox reply is that all countries have the
right to self-government, regardless of how they will misuse it.
That orthodoxy has resulted in one African state after another
being allowed to go to hell in its own way.
   In the main this has not mattered much except to the miserable
inhabitants themselves. Famine apart, the rest of the world has
looked the other way. Let ill alone has been the white man's motto.
   South Africa is different. South Africa is a serious country.
What happens there matters. Nor does it matter only to the West. It
matters almost equally to the Soviet Union. Chaos in the gold and
diamond markets might be the last straw that broke the back of the
Soviet economy. ...
   No new constitutional settlement entrenching white rights has
any serious chance of lasting unless it is guaranteed, policed and,
in effect, upheld by the great powers _ the United States, Russia
and Western Europe. Conventional wisdom will dismiss such idea as
wildly fanciful.
   So in many ways it is. But it is far less wildly fanciful than
the orthodox assumption that whites and blacks in South Africa,
left to their own devices, have a chance in hell of living happily
ever after. If the outside world is serious about helping South
Africa, it will have to do more about ensuring the right results
than holding the occasional rock concert.

   El Mercurio, Santiago, Chile, on the Communist Party in Italy:
   The collapse of the entire eastern European bloc in late 1989
and the weakening of the ideological faith in the Soviet Union
itself, have led the Italian Communist Party to the brink of a
situation nobody would have imagined a few years ago _ a discussion
about abandoning the Commuist doctrine.
   The setback suffered by the Communist Party in recent regional
elections will certainly heighten the party's internal debate.
   Whatever the outcome of the discussion might be, the fact
remains that this is a party that has lost faith in its old creed.
Thus, it does not seem remote the time when the Communists may join
in alliances with socialist and liberal groups.

   A kind of vaccine that protects plants
against pests can reduce reliance on hazardous pesticides, the
vaccine's developer says.
   The vaccine involves the insertion of bacteria called endophytes
into a plant's seeds. The bacteria have been genetically engineered
to carry a naturally occurring protein that kills inects, said
Peter S. Carlson, who developed the vaccine.
   As the plant grows, the endophytes spread the protein throughout
the plant, he said Tuesday at a Rockefeller Foundation seminar on
agricultural research.
   ``This is something brand new,'' he said. ``No one ever thought
of using endophytes before.''
   Researchers reported in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute Tuesday that flour mill workers had a cancer rate nine
times that of grain workers not exposed to the chemicals. The
researchers suspected but did not prove that exposure to pesticides
in grain storage was the cause.
   Reports like that are encouraging researchers to find
alternatives to pesticides.
   David Pimentel of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. estimates
that pesticides poison 500,000 people around the world annually,
resulting in 10,000 deaths.
   Furthermore, the public health and environmental problems
associated with pesticides are costing the U.S. government $3
billion per year, Pimentel said at the seminar.
   Carlson, who founded Crop Genetics International in Hanover, Md.
to produce the plant vaccine, has completed two years of field
tests of corn that had been vaccinated to protect it against the
European corn borer.
   This pest, a tiny caterpillar, destroys $500 million worth of
corn per year in the United States, said Carlson.
   The vaccine has proven to be safe, and the tests have shown that
the genetically engineered endophytes don't spread appreciably into
neighboring plants, Carlson said.
   Unlike human vaccines, the plant vaccine does not boost the
plant's immune system to ward off pests. The endophytes are
genetically engineered to include a gene from a bacterium called
Bacillus thuringiensis.
   Once that gene has been put into the endophytes, they make a
Bacillus thuringiensis protein that kills the European corn borer.
   The endophytes spread through the corn plant as it grows,
causing it no harm but carrying the insecticidal protein with them.
   When corn borers move into the corn stem, where they feed, they
encounter the protein and are killed.
   Conventional insecticides are not too effective against corn
borers, Carlson said, because the insecticides do not get inside
the corn plants where the pests live.
   Another advantage is that biological pesticides like this one do
not affect other insect species. ``These are not broad-based
poisons. They are specific biological toxins,'' Carlson said.
   The endophytes and their toxic protein are not passed on to
future generations of the plant through its seeds, Carlson said.
And the corn produced by vaccinated plants has not been genetically
altered itself, so it need not pass rigorous safety tests required
by the federal government of genetically engineered organisms.
   Carlson is now seeking approval for the vaccine from the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Carlson said that field tests are continuing and the vaccinated
corn could be on the market by 1993 or 1994, if the tests are
successful and the government approves the vaccine.

   President Bush said today that the continued
standoff in the secessionist Baltics republics ``certainly puts
some tension'' on his upcoming summit with Mikhail Gorbachev, but
stressed his determination to press ahead with arms control
negotiations.
   The president said he was waiting to hear from Secretary of
State James A. Baker as to whether meetings underway in Moscow
might indicate progress in arms talks.
   ``I would not predict that these matters cannot be resolved in
time for the summit,'' he said of several pending treaties.
   Bush opened a mid-day news conference with an ``urgent appeal''
to Congress to approve his request for millions of dollars in
economic aid to Nicaragua and Panama. He called on Congress to
cancel a planned Memorial Day recess next week to act on the
legislation.
   Asked about the remaining six American hostages in captivity in
Lebanon, Bush said, ``I have seen no reason to be encouraged that
the process is under way'' that would lead to their release. Two
Americans, Frank Reed and Robert Polhill, have been released in
recent weeks.
   The president also said he would announce a decision in ``days
and not weeks'' on whether to approve a ban on offshore oil
drilling off the coast of Florida and California. He cited
nvironmental concerns, but also noted he did not want the United
States to become more dependent on foreign oil.
   Bush also told reporters he thought his administration and
congressional leaders would be able to reach accord on a bipartisan
program to cut a burgeoning deficit.
   On other domestic issues, Bush said he was confident he could
work out an agreement with members of Congress on civil rights
legislation. The president has met with civil rights leaders and
other in recent days.
   He was less optimistic about legislation mandating companies to
provide leave time for new parents. ``I've got some problems with
that one,'' he said. The White House has said previously Bush would
veto the measure that recently passed the House.
   Bush sounded none to confident about events in the Soviet Union,
where Baker told reporters he hadn't seen much to be encouraged
about in Moscow's response to the Baltic drives for independence.
   Bush said the United States would like to see ``negotiations or
dialogue, discussion, whatever you call it,'' between the Kremlin
and the independent-minded Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia.
   Calling on Moscow to end the economic pressures imposed on
Lithuania, Bush said, ``Until something like that happens, there
will be tension,'' between the United States and the Soviet Union.
But he indicated he was looking forward to his May 30-June 3
meetings with Gorbachev, saying pointedly, ``We negotiated with the
Soviets when all Eastern Europe was in captivity.''
   The president sidestepped questions about whether he would
accept higher taxes. Bush campaign on a ``no new tax'' pledge, but
has said there are no preconditions in the deficit reduction talks
with Congress.
   Bush is scheduled to meet with Soviet President Gorbachev in
Washington in little more that two weeks, and Secretary of State
Baker was in Moscow today for a final round of pre-summit talks.
   The Nicaraguan aid request has been hung up in Congress for
weeks, as lawmakers have tripled the cost and added ``mischievous''
amendments, Bush said. ``Provisions that have absolutely nothing to
do with Nicaragua and Panama.''
   Later, in reply to a question, he said he would veto the aid
bill if Congress attached a provisioin liberalizing restrictions on
abortions.
   ``The situation in Nicaragua is absolutely critical,'' Bush
said. He said the government of Violetta Chamorro had asked for an
emergency briudge loan, but Bush said, ``I can't provide a loan''
anchored on legislation that is not assured.''

   Housing starts fell in April to their lowest
level since the last recession in 1982, the government said
Wednesday.
   Interest rates remained high and the availability of
construction money fell, and analysts said the tight money
situation was increasing housing costs and causing unemployment.
   ``The (lending) spigot has been turned off,'' said Martin
Perlman, president of the National Association of Home Builders.
``The result will be higher housing costs.''
   Perlman said the Home Builders had dropped their 1990 forecast
from 1.42 million starts to 1.28 million, which would mean a loss
of 200,000 jobs in the housing industry.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
fell 5.8 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.25 million units, the smallest number since an annual rate of
1.17 million units in the recession month of October 1982.
   Applications for building permits _ often a barometer of future
housing activity _ were down 8.7 percent to an annual rate of 1.13
million, the lowest level since 1.05 million were sought in
September 1982.
   Analysts attributed the situation to high interest rates and a
credit crunch caused by the savings and loan bailout law and
tighter lending policies by commercial banks.
   ``That certainly must have given home builders a lot to think
about before going out and starting new units,'' said Richard
Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said new home sales had been hurt by rising mortgage
rates. But he noted that mortgage rates usually follow the pattern
of long-term bond rates, which have been declining for several
weeks.
   ``So my best guess is we'll see some modest declines in mortgage
rates over the remainder of the year,'' he said.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist with the National Association
of Realtors, said the S&amp;L bailout law was contributing to the
credit crunch by reducing the amount of money that can be loaned to
a single builder.
   ``This factor, coupled with the credit crunch being experienced
across the country, particularly in the Northeast, has had a biting
effect on housing starts,'' he said.
   Perlman said a survey of 6,000 builders indicated that 60
percent of those responding were cutting back plans for future
housing, laying off employees and, in some cases, ``just calling it
quits.''
   After jumping 23.2 percent in January, the warmest January on
record, housing starts have declined for three straight months _
5.8 percent in April, 11.2 percent in March and 5.1 percent in
February.
   Single-family starts in April fell 7.5 percent to an annual rate
of 934,000 units, the lowest level since a 931,000-unit rate in
December, the fourth coldest December on record. Single-family
starts had fallen 12.5 percent in March.
   Apartment construction was unchanged at 311,000 units after
falling 6.9 percent in March.
   The only gain in starts was in the Midwest, where they were up
3.8 percent to an annual rate of 298,000 units.
   Starts in the South dropped 8.7 percent, to an annual rate of
480,000. They were down 8.1 percent, to 340,000 units, in the West
and 8 percent, to 127,000 units, in the Northeast.
   The building activity means the pace during the first four
months of 1990 was 4 percent below that of the same period of 1989.

   A pro-Sandinista strike virtually
paralyzed public services in the capital today, putting staggering
pressures on the 3-week-old government of Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   In another blow to the government and the crippled economy, the
Bush administration said it could not provide a $40 million loan
for legal reasons.
   Striking public employees spent their second day occupying
government buildings, but the capital was quiet this morning. Talks
between the government and the strikers broke off around midnight,
a Sandinista newspaper reported.
   Nicaraguan and U.S. government officials accused the once-ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front of trying to undermine the
conservative administration, a charge no Sandinista official has
denied publicly so far.
   Sonia Ortiz, a labor leader, said the strikers want a 200
percent pay raise, a subsidized food package, rehiring of a labor
leader fired Monday, and the demobilization of the Contra rebels.
   ``Lady Violeta has no idea what organized Sandinista workers
are,'' she said.
   The governing coalition UNO, which backed Mrs. Chamorro en route
to her Feb. 25 election victory, issued a letter of support for
her. The 14-party coalition recently had been suffering from
factional disputes.
   Three weeks ago today, Mrs. Chamorro inherited an economy
ravaged by 11 years of leftist Sandinista mismanagement, the Contra
insurgency and a U.S. embargo that was lifted when she took office.
Inflation is running about 70 percent a month.
   In a cable to President Bush, Mrs. Chamorro appealed for a quick
$40 million to curb the economic crisis that led to the strikes
while Congress considers a $300 million aid request.
   ``My country is bankrupt,'' she said in a cable dated May 11
that was obtained Tuesday.
   But a White House official said today that it cannot provide the
money because, as a temporary loan, the funds would have to be tied
to some future expectation of revenue.
   Without assurances that lawmakers will approve the $300 million
in aid, the necessary guarantee was missing, the official said on
condition of anonymity. Bush instead planned to renew his plea for
the aid package, the official said.
   Striking airport workers closed the international airport.
Schools, banks and most communications were halted Tuesday, and
only about 20 buses operated, stranding thousands.
   Public hospitals were open but one said it would limit treatment
to the very old or young, pregnant women and emergency cases.
   Telephone, telegraph and telex communications were dead, cutting
off most of Nicaragua from the rest of the world. Communications
workers allowed journalists to file stories but denied service to
others.
   Outgoing phone service even to President Chamorro's offices was
cut for several hours on Tuesday.
   Government buildings in Managua remained occupied, but
electricity and water supplies to the capital were not halted early
today as threatened a day earlier by striking utility workers.
   Officially, the goal is higher pay but Mrs. Chamorro is looming
as a major and growing target. Her government has declared the
strikes illegal.
   Shouts of ``Violeta, start packing your bags!'' ``The people own
the government, not the bourgeoisie!'' and ``Not one step back!''
flew through muggy Managua streets Tuesday as workers occupied the
buildings and police stood by or made half-hearted attempts to
remove them.
   At the ministries of Agrarian Reform and Commerce and Industry
the police, most of whom were hired by the Sandinistas, stood
around joking with the strikers.
   Vice President Virgilio Godoy said on the radio the Sandinistas
are ``trying to overthrow President Chamorro.''
   ``It is unfortunate that the Sandinistas, despite their promises
to work with the Chamorro government to achieve economic
reconstruction and national reconciliation, are engaging in what
appear to be politically motivated strikes,'' said U.S. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington.
   Officially, the strike is being coordinated by the Union of
National Employees, a relatively obscure but militantly
pro-Sandinista labor federation. It has a lower profile than the
better-known Sandinista Workers Central, tied in the public eye to
the Sandinista organization.
   Most government workers are Sandinistas left over from the
previous government.
   But Dania Salazar, a communications worker, said she opposed the
strike because President Chamorro had been in office just three
weeks ``and we must let her try to do something first.''
   Neither Mrs. Chamorro nor Sandinista former President Daniel
Ortega made a public statement about the walkouts Tuesday.
   At the Foreign Ministry, an angry mob rushed Foreign Minister
Enrique Dreyfus and a group of Managua's newly appointed
ambassadors, who took refuge in a nearby restaurant.
   ``You have no business in Nicaragua! Go back to Miami!'' the mob
shouted at the diplomats inside the steak house.
   Many anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans lived in Miami before Mrs.
Chamorro took office April 25.
   ``This is a trial by force with the Sandinistas,'' said Ernesto
Palazio, appointed Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington, who stood
with his fellow diplomats before the mob rushed them.
   Mrs. Chamorro has promised to undo many of the leftist policies
enacted by the Sandinistas, who insist on retaining control of the
military and say their revolutionary reforms should not be touched.

<HEAD>Child in Need of Heart Surgery Returned to Hospital</HEAD>

   A young girl in need of heart surgery was
returned today to the hospital where she was abducted last week
allegedly by her mother, who opposed the operation on religious
grounds, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Kimberly Winfield, 12, was being examined by doctors and her
condition was not yet known, Children's Memorial Hospital
spokeswoman Erin Shields said.
   Kimberly, taken from the hospital last Thursday, was returned to
the hospital by Russ Ewing, a local television reporter who has
previously acted as a go-between in hostage situations, Shields
said.
   The girl's mother, a Jehovah's Witness, opposed on religious
grounds the open-heart surgery recommended by the girl's doctors,
said Dave Schneidman, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services.
   The mother, identified by Schneidman as either Caroline or
Carolyn Winfield, 35, was with the girl at the hospital today,
Schneidman said.
   Winfield asked for Ewing's help after she realized she'd been
spotted at an apartment Catholic Charities was trying to arrange
for the family, Schneidman said.
   Police and officials of Catholic Charities were en route to pick
up the mother and child when Winfield turned herself over to Ewing,
Schneidman said.
   Winfield, a homeless woman, was reported to the family services
agency because of the destitute position in which she and her
family were found, he said.
   ``The fact was, the mother and three children were reported to
us because they were homeless, they were destitute, they had no
place to live,'' Schneidman said.
   ``We found them walking in the rain on the South Side,'' he
said. ``The children were poorly dressed, they were dirty. Kimberly
was being pushed around by her mother in some rickety wheelchair.
It was obvious they needed help.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Wednesday:
   Well, today, I'm making an urgent appeal to Congress to come to
the assistance of the peoples of Nicaragua and Panama. I announced
my original request for $500 _ $500 million in assistance to Panama
on Jan,. 25. And on March 13, I submitted my modified request for
$800 million for both Nicaragua and Panama.
   At the time of submission, I asked the Congress for passage of
the legislation by April 5. When that date passed, I asked for
passage in time for Violetta Chamorro's inauguration on April 25.
   I also asked members of Congress, in public and in private, that
the bill not be loaded up with extraneous items. And members of our
administration have met with the Congress to explain the content
and the urgency of this request.
   But the Easter recess came and went with no passage and,
moreover, the bill has tripled in size as extraneous items have
been piled onto it. Even worse, the additional amendments include
provisions that I vetoed as recently as last fall, provisions that
have absolutely nothing to do with Nicaragua and Panama. And I've
met repeatedly with the leadership of both houses of the Congress
to urge rapid passage.

<HEAD>University Reps Ask Cheney To Change Gay-ROTC Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four groups representing most of the nation's
colleges and universities have urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
to change the Pentagon's policy barring homosexuals from military
service.
   In a letter hand-delivered Tuesday and made available Wednesday
to The Associated Press, the four higher education associations
said the Pentagon policy dated back to the days of official
discrimination against blacks and other minority groups.
   The letter focused on the policy's impact on Reserve Officer
Training Corps cadets. Several cadets in recent months have been
denied commissions after telling superiors they were gay. In most
of those cases, the military has sought repayment from the cadets
of scholarships and other money.
   ``The arguments for change in current ROTC practices are
several, and seem to many of us compelling,'' the four association
presidents wrote.
   The groups represented were the American Council on Education,
the Association of American Universities, the American Association
of State Colleges and Universities and the National Association of
State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. Together, they
represent virtually all of the colleges in the country.
   The association heads asked for a meeting with Cheney.
   Maj. Doug Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said Wednesday
that Cheney's office had received the letter but ``he has not
actually looked at it himself.''
   The association heads wrote: ``Sexual orientation appears to be
the only basis on which discrimination is condoned within ROTC or
similar programs.
   ``Denial of equal opportunity on the grounds of race, gender,
religion, nationality or political affiliation, among other
possible criteria, has long since been barred,'' they said.
``Discrimination based on sexual orientation thus remains a curious
anomaly.''
   The Pentagon policy often runs counter to explicit prohibitions
set by the schools against anti-gay discrimination. In the case of
the University of Wisconsin, the policy runs counter to state law,
the association heads noted.
   The leaders warned that by continuing the policy, the Defense
Department would not only deprive itself of many qualified recruits
who happen to be gay, but would also drive away ``many who hold
conventional sexual views but find discrimination unacceptable in
any form.''
   Hart took issue with the point in the letter suggesting that
denial of equal opportunity based on ``political affiliation'' has
been barred in the past.
   ``I don't think if a person said they were a member of the
Communist Party they'd have much luck getting an ROTC
scholarship,'' he said.
   The involvement of the education groups stemmed from incidents
on various campuses involving protests against the ROTC policy or
actual cases in which gay cadets were denied commissions and told
to repay their tuition scholarships.

<HEAD>Baker Says Soviet Response to Baltic Crisis `Not Encouraging'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New material from Bush news conference; editing throughout;
no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today
the Soviet response to pleas that they open negotiations with
Baltic republics pushing for independence is ``not encouraging.''
   Baker, starting four days of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze, said he would press Soviet officials to explain
why they have not negotiated with leaders of the restive Baltic
states.
   ``That dialogue has not yet developed,'' Baker said before going
into talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who also is
visiting Moscow. ``It's not encouraging to us to see the absence of
a dialogue between leaders there and the Kremlin.''
   In Washington, President Bush told a news conference he was
concerned that the Baltics problem could inflect damage on the
wider Soviet-American relationship.
   ``It certainly has put some tension in the summit'' meeting he
is to open with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Washington
on May 30, Bush said. But he said the issue is not a reason to end
or slow down discussion on arms control and other issues.
   Bush said it was too early to tell whether remaining obstacles
to a treaty cutting long-range nuclear weapons could be overcome in
time for the Washington summit.
   ``I wouldn't say it appears unlikely'' that at least the main
elements of an agreement could be in place by then, he said.
   After meeting with Mubarak, Baker met with Jewish ``refuseniks''
who have been denied Soviet exit permits. He then sat down with
Shevardnadze to prepare for the U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington
later this month.
   Baker, who also will meet Friday with Gorbachev, hoped to revive
stalemated arms-control talks as well as discuss the unrest in the
Baltics.
   Shevardnadze told reporters before his session with Baker at the
Soviet Foreign Ministry the fact ``we are able to discuss any
problem shows we have reached a new frontier.''
   He also pledged to try to speed arms control agreements that
were to serve as a centerpiece for the summit. ``We have been
working very intensively,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Asked if the Soviets had retreated, as some U.S. officials
insist, Shevardnadze replied through an interpreter: ``I don't
think so, this is the view of those who really don't know what's
happening.''
   Baker, meanwhile, said the effort now to bridge differences ``is
very important when you consider we have only two weeks to go.''
   Leaders in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
have been attempting to open talks with Gorbachev over independence
efforts, but the Soviet leader has balked.
   A pro-independence newspaper, The Estonian Independent, reported
that Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told Baker in a
telegram that the Estonian government ``would be deeply surprised
were the incidents in Estonia and Latvia not to find
reverberation'' in his talks with Shevardnadze.
   Tension between Moscow and the three breakaway republics casts
an shadow over the summit, which is due to begin May 30. There are
also deep differences between U.S. and Soviet negotiators over
missile reductions.
   ``It's our desire _ and I hope it's the desire of the Soviets,
they say it is _ that we can close the gap on all of the major
substantive issues by the time the two presidents get together in
Washington,'' Baker told reporters.
   But he stressed that ``We still have a pretty good road to
travel ... there are still a number of issues between us.''
   Baker was asked about the Baltics when he arrived at the
Egyptian Embassy to see Mubarak about prospects for negotiations
between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   Mubarak gave a downbeat assessment of the situation in the
Middle East.
   He said there had been ``nothing positive from the direction''
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir since the Israeli leader last
month declined to endorse Baker's framework for talks with
Palestinians in Cairo.
   Administration officials accompanying Baker said he had no plans
to present Mubarak, who was here to confer with Soviet officials,
with a new approach to getting peace talks going between Israel and
Palestinians.
   The secretary of state went from his meeting with Mubarak to a
session with 15 Jewish ``refuseniks'' who have been denied Soviet
exit permits.
   The refuseniks are Jews who have long awaited permission to
emigrate. Baker said there are 79 unresolved cases of applicants
that have U.S. support.
   ``We're very anxious that they be given permission to
emigrate,'' he told reporters.
   Two U.S. officials who traveled to Moscow with Baker told
reporters the Soviets had backtracked on certain potential arms
reduction measures in talks in Washington last month after having
made considerable headway in February in Moscow.
   ``There has been some movement to try to pick up the pieces,''
one of the officials said of ongoing talks in Geneva. But he
declined to venture a prediction of Baker success, or to describe
recent headway as substantial.
   ``It would be very disturbing if they were not prepared to get
back to where we were,'' said the official who, like his colleague,
spoke only on condition of not being identified by name.
   Baker aides said on the flight from Washington to Moscow that
key issues remain unresolved.
   The differences are over restrictions to be placed on cruise
missiles carried aboard planes and warships, on mobile missiles
with multiple warheads and on heavy land-based missiles.
   In addition, the two sides have not yet agreed to a method of
verifying compliance with reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.
Other issues include completion of an accord on ending the
production of chemical weapons and reducing troop and tank strength
in Europe.

   If you knew Sammy Davis Jr., you loved him,
admired him and marveled at the energy and talent that made him a
singing, dancing, acting and comedy star who had no rivals, friends
throughout Hollywood said today.
   ``He could dance as well as anyone, he could sing as well as
anyone, he had the timing and delivery of the best comedians,''
said longtime friend Joey Bishop, who along with Davis, Frank
Sinatra and Dean Martin formed the core of Hollywood's fun-loving,
high-living but hard-working ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s.
   Davis died early today after a long battle with cancer. He was
64.
   ``Guess they must need a good show up in heaven, that's all I
can say,'' added Bishop. ``God, I'm sorry. I loved him.''
   ``I think in his 64 years he lived 100 years,'' said another
longtime friend, comedian Milton Berle. ``He loved people and he
loved his work, he loved show business.''
   Berle's voice broke several times as he recounted a friendship
he said dated back at least 60 years.
   ``I appeared with his dad back before Sammy was even born,''
Berle said. ``I'm kind of choked up about this because he was a
darling man and we'll all miss him.''
   ``I don't ever remember having so much fun as during those
years,'' Bishop said as he recounted his adventures with Davis and
others during the ``Rat Pack'' days.
   Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner, who often had Davis at his
Playboy mansions in Chicago and New York, praised the entertainer
for bringing joy to many millions of fans.
   ``No one has brought more joy to the world over the past
half-century than Sammy,'' Hefner said in a statement. I know
because I was there. Mr. Wonderful is what he was and what he
always will be.''
   From New York, singer-actress Lena Horne added: ``There'll never
be anyone like him. He was the most talented. Whenever he appeared
with others, he was the star. Whenever he appeared alone, he was
the star.''
   Comedian and TV star Bill Cosby said of the death: ``It's a
shame. It would have been fantastic to see him at age 82 still
enjoying performing for the people. I'll see him later.''

<TEXT>
   More than a dozen rockets slammed
into the Afghan capital Wednesday, including one that landed in the
compound of the vacated U.S. Embassy, Radio Kabul reported. It said
six people died in the raids.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attacks. Unlike in the
past, the radio did not blame the barrage on the ``Pakistan-backed
opposition'' _ a reference to Afghan rebels.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 17 people were wounded
in the rocket attacks.
   Afghab rebels, supported by Pakistan and the United States, have
been fighting 12 years to unseat Afghanistan's Soviet-style
government.
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul shortly before the
last Soviet combat troops withdrew from Afghanistan in February
1989.
   The U.S. administration at the time said it was closing its
mission because Kabul's government could not guarantee security.

   President Bush said today he won't attempt to
rally public support for slashing the deficit until a bipartisan
compromise is framed, saying it could ``send the wrong signals'' to
financial markets.
   Bush also told a news conference that he won't be bullied by
Democrats into showing his hand first in proposing a package of
spending cuts and possible tax increases.
   ``Let's not talk about who's going first, we've got a problem, a
national problem,'' Bush said.
   His comments came as congressional Democrats criticized him for
refusing to go directly to the public with the economic bad news
that prompted him to call a summit on the budget deficit.
   ``I don't want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the
markets,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm not going to go out there with a lot of suggestions to
part of the problem,'' he added.
   He said that some Democrats he met with on Tuesday at the
kickoff session of his domestic budget summit had suggested that he
go first.
   ``I said, wait a minute,'' Bush said, adding that he had
reminded lawmakers that taxes and spending originate in Congress.
   Bush the day before had spurned the request of some Democrats
that he go on prime-time television to discuss the seriousness of
the widening budget gap.
   ``At the appropriate time, I will,'' said Bush. Asked when that
would be, Bush said: ``I don't know. We've got to get on with what
I told you the process is. And the process is not setting
preconditions.''
   Asked if the current budget situation was a test of his
leadership on a major domestic problem, Bush said: ``I expect so.''
   As he has before, Bush completely sidestepped the issue of new
taxes, saying that he did not want to comment on any issues that
might be up for negotiation.
   Asked if a tax existed that would not be a drag on the economy,
Bush declared: ``You're trying to get me to do that which just one
second ago I wouldn't do.''
   But, on the prospect of reaching a budget compromise that can
win the support of the administration and a majority of both House
and Senate, the president said: ``After some initial posturing
around, we'll make some headway.''
   Bush said that he hopes to see interest rates fall, but had no
guarantee from the Federal Reserve that the central bank would act
to force rates down.
   The administration has cited rising interest rates, along with
lower-than-expected revenues and a higher-than expected pricetag on
the savings and loan bailout as the reason for the widening deficit
gap.
   Earlier today, Democrats criticized Bush for not presenting his
own remedies for trimming the deficit.
   ``If we're in such bad straits ... the American people ought to
hear it, and let's get on with fixing the crisis,'' said Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a member of the House Budget Committee.
   At the first session of the budget summit on Tuesday, a
closed-door session, the president's budget director said the
deficit could near $200 billion next year unless action is taken.
   The budget talks began two weeks after Congress began moving
toward approval of $1.2 trillion spending plans written by
Democrats. Those measures slash Bush's proposed Pentagon budget,
but lack the deficit reduction the White House now says is needed.
   Bargainers said that while Tuesday's session went well, no
specific approaches for attacking the shortfall were discussed,
including possible tax increases or spending cuts.
   ``Everything was generalities,'' said Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the House Appropriations
Committee.
   Participants said the 100-minute meeting focused on the growing
size of the budget gap and the urgency of tackling the problem.
   One negotiator, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn., said he believes Bush wants Democrats to first reveal
their own deficit-reduction ideas.
   Sasser also said that at Tuesday's session, White House budget
chief Richard Darman offered new figures further swelling the
expected size of the budget gap for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct.
1.
   According to Sasser, Darman said next year's deficit would range
between $140 billion and $188 billion if the costs of rescuing the
savings and loan industry are included. The shortfall would be
about $138 billion if those expenses are not counted.
   The new figures mean it would take $72 billion to $124 billion
in some combination of higher taxes and spending cuts to stay
within the Gramm-Rudman deficit limit of $64 billion for next year.
   One possible outcome of the talks, however, is an agreement to
raise next year's deficit target, thus requiring fewer cuts or new
taxes. Darman has said he believes a good goal for the negotiators
is agreement on a $50 billion deficit reduction package.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: rapid passage.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the last several days, I've shared with them the contents of
this letter that I received from President Chamorro of Nicaragua
pleading for prompt passage.
   The situation in Nicaragua is critical. Mrs. Chamorro's
government is absolutely bankrupt, and there are strikes and
demonstrations in the streets.
   She's asked me for an emergency bridge loan, but I can't provide
that because the Nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment,
and our hands are tied, and I can't provide a loan anchored on
legislation which is not assured. Panama is also in dire need of
the jump-start that our assistance will give to enable it to
recover from the economic devastation of the Noriega dictatorship.
   We're now facing the Memorial Day recess without the assurance
that this legislation will be passed. I would like the legislation
this week, certainly early next week, but I will call on the
Congress to remain in session until it completes action on a bill
that I can sign.
   We must not let this procedural gridlock in the Congress destroy
the hopes for freedom in these two fledgling democracies. I feel
very strongly about it, and I will again appeal to Congress to get
moving on this bill.
   Q: Mr. President, officials accompanying Secretary of State
Baker to Moscow say the Soviets have backtracked on earlier
agreements on arms control. Does it appear unlikely that you'll
have the outlines of a START treaty to sign at the summit, and how
much of a setback would that be?
   A: Terry, I don't _ I wouldn't say that ``it appears unlikely.''
I have not heard from Jim Baker since the talks have started in
Moscow. I expect we'll be hearing pretty soon. But I would not
predict that these matters cannot be resolved in time for the
summit, but if they're not, we're going to keep on, because we want
a START agreement and I'm convinced the Soviets want a START
agreement.
   Q: How much of a cloud has been put over the summit by the
tension _ the Soviet pressure on the Baltic States?
   A: Well, I'll be able to answer that a little more after Jim
comes back from Moscow, but I'd say that it is _ certainly puts
some tension on the summit. We want to see negotiations or dialogue
or whatever you call it, discussions, between Gorbachev and the
Lithuanians get going. And then I'd like to see the release of that
economic pressure on Lithuania. And that would clear the air fast.
But until something like that happens there will be tension.
   But we have a broad agenda of items that we must go forward on.
And we have negotiated with the Soviets when all of Eastern Europe
was in captivity, and when we had Cold War times. And I _ I'm
unhappy about the state of play in the Baltics, because I'd like to
see them obtain their desire of freedom as soon as possible.
   But I feel that it's important from our standpoint, the
important standpoint of Eastern European countries and Western
European allies and, indeed, the whole world, that we have these
discussions with Mr. Gorbachev and I look forward to them very
much, and I particularly look forward to the private ones where I
can get a better feel for the problems facing him and I can tell
him of our priorities in a very frank setting.
   Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, will you sign the Panama-Nicaraguan aid bill
if it contains funding for abortion? Will you sign the parental
leave bill, and will you sign the Civil Rights Act?
   A: On the _ on the _ I will not accept the Nicaragua-Panama bill
with that mischievous language placed on it. It has nothing to do
with Nicaragua and Panama and it ought to be taken out. But if they
don't _ if it comes to me that way it will go right back up and
we'll still urge the Congress to do what they ought to do to help
these democracies.
   What were the other two?
   Q: The Civil Rights Act and parental leave. You have a _ have
you removed a veto threat on civil rights and the threat remains on
parental leave?
   A: Civil rights; we're working hard to get agreement. We've had
a series of meetings. I've participated in two of them. We've had
three at the White House with leadership groups. Our staff is
working with Congress and I hope we can narrow the differences
enough so that we can go forward together on this legislation.
   And parental leave, I've got some real problems with that one,
but I just have to _ have to wait 'til I get recommendations on it.

<HEAD>Government Opens Hospitals to All Races</HEAD>

<DATELINE>South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major reform, the
government Wednesda   JOHANNESBURG,y declared public hospitals open to
all races,
reversing its decades-old policy of segregated health services.
   Health Minister Rina Venter told Parliament in Cape Town that
all hospitals must be available to all South Africans for the
country's health system to run effectively.
   ``All hospitals are now accessible to all people in South
Africa,'' Venter said in an interview after leaving Parliament.
   The health minister said the decision was effective immediately
and that patients staying at overcrowded black hospitals now could
be moved to underutilized white hospitals.
   Asked if she was worried about the reaction from conservative
whites, Venter said, ``No. I think (integrated hospitals) will be
in thecurrent talks and said he had rejected calls that he go
first with a comprehensive package of his own. ``Let's not talk
about who's going first, we've got a problem, a national problem,''
he said, adding he didn't to ``inadvertently send the wrong signals
to the markets.''
   
   US-CHINA
   
   Bush said ``it isn't an easy call'' on whether to grant China
preferential trade benefits under most-favored-nation status, a
decision he has to make by June 3. He said he didn't want to ``send
a signal that we're happy'' with China's human rights record, but
that the trade concessions are important to the Chinese people and
to Hong Kong.
   
   HOSTAGES
   
   Bush said he has seen ``no reason to be encouraged'' that the
remaining six American hostages in Lebanon will be freed soon. Two
Americans, Frank Reed and Robert Polhill, have been released in
recent weeks.
   
   OFFSHORE OIL
   
   Bush said he would announce a decision in ``days and not weeks''
on whether to approve a ban on offshore oil drilling off the coast
of Florida and California. He said environmental concerns are being
considered, but also noted he did not want the United States to
become more dependent on foreign oil.
   
   FAMILY LEAVE
   
   Bush said he's ``got some problems'' with a measure approved by
the House to mandate family leave from jobs for new parents. The
White House has said Bush would veto such a bill.
   
   CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   Bush said his administration ``was working hard to get an
agreement'' with Congress on civil rights legislation. Some members
of Congress want a bill to reverse recent Supreme Court decisions

   PHILIPPINES-BASES
   
   He said the United States would reluctantly give up its two
military bases in the Philippines if the government of Corazon
Aquino demands too high a price. ``There are certain limits to what
I will do'' to meet Philippine demands, he said. The bases in the
Philippines are not ``something absolutely essential to the United
States,'' he said, adding, ``There are other ways to skin this
cat.''

   Lawrence Harrington says he has not eaten British
beef for 12 weeks and that the hamburger meat in his butcher shop
is Irish.
   He too is caught up in the panic that has spread across Britain
over so-called Mad Cow Disease.
   Britain's chief medical officer tried to calm consumers with a
statement that ``beef can be eaten safely by everyone, both adults
and children.''
   But more than 1,000 schools have dropped British beef from their
cafeteria menus.
   A Parliamentary committee Wednesday announced an urgent inquiry
into the mysterious disease _ bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE _ which affects a cow's brain and central nervous system.
   ``What we hope to do is either allay fears or, if there is a
problem, force the government to do things that will then calm the
fears of the public,'' said Martyn Jones, a microbiologist and
Labor Party member of the House of Commons agriculture committee.
   The government said there is no known case of BSE affecting a
human. But the fears intensified last week when the government
reported that a Siamese cat had died from a suspected feline
version of BSE.
   ``I've been in this business for 17 years, and I've never seen
beef sales drop off like this,'' said Harrington, leaning against
the counter of his shop, Bruton Meat. Across the road at
Smithfield's meat market, crews hosed meat and blood off the street
in preparation for the refrigerated trucks that rumble nightly into
London's wholesale meat market.
   Cattle suffering the disease foam at the mouth and are unable to
stand or walk normally.
   The precise cause of the disease is unknown. But experts believe
the cattle contracted it by eating high-protein feed containing the
remains of sheep infected with a strain of BSE.
   Since 1986, when BSE was first identified, 13,000 head of cattle
have been slaughtered, the National Farmers Union said.
   Harrington said the government should act forcefully to calm
people.
   ``All the herds where they've found one diseased cow should be
destroyed so they can put people's minds to rest,'' he said.
   Barry Simmons, a butcher for 35 years, also criticized the
government.
   ``The government's not clarifying it,'' said Simmons at his
central London shop. ``It's become political _ the government
doesn't want to lose the farmers' vote. What's upsetting the public
the most is not actually knowing.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said British beef was
the main dish at lunch Wednesday with Greek Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Agriculture Minister John Gummer ate a hamburger for the cameras
and declared: ``I can say perfectly honestly that I shall go on
eating beef and my children will go on eating beef because there is
no danger.''
   Simmons said he had not noticed a substantial drop in British
beef sales.
   He surmised that having endured major scares about contaminated
water, salmonella in eggs and listeria in chickens, people are fed
up with worrying.
   ``People just say sod it, if the beef don't kill you the chicken
or the water will,'' he said.
   Richard Guy said the scare boosted sales for his Real Meat
Company, which sells grass-fed beef.
   ``We're all more likely to be run over on our way back home
tonight than we are to get BSE,'' he told BBC-TV. ``But I do feel a
disease that can knock a half-ton animal out and render it a sort
of gibbering idiot must be looked into fairly urgently.''
   Because of BSE, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of cattle, embryos
and bull semen from Great Britain in July 1989. Similar bans have
been imposed by the Soviet Union, Australia, Israel and Britain's
European Community partners.

   exclusivism.''
   However, a Southern Baptist church historian, the Rev. G. Thomas
Halbrooks, said at a later session that despite impressions to the
contrary, the ``historic Baptist stance'' favored relationships
with other churches.
   ``Others have often perceived Southern Baptists as being
isolated sectarians who consider themselves as having no need for
relationships with anyone else,'' he said.
   Some actions have upheld that ``negative perspective,'' said
Halbrooks, president of the denomination's Historical Society and a
professor at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C.
   He said the 15 million-member denomination has varied roots,
some of them such as the ``colonial root'' and ``Eastern root''
supporting cooperation with other denominations. On the other hand,
he said, a ``frontier root'' and ``Western root'' stressed
exclusivity as ``the only true church'' and joined with the
provincial ``Southern root'' in becoming dominant.
   ``Southern Baptists may look to their Eastern and colonial roots
and there find guideposts that can point the way out of the
darkness of their provincialism into the brightness of the broader
community of the Christian faith,'' he said.
   In the earlier comments from other denominations reported by
Baptist Press, Dalton, who for aRoman Catholic
observer at Southern Baptist conventions, said he admires their
zeal and music.
   But he said the in-fighting and preoccupation with church
membership threaten to obscure larger social issues, while a ``lack
of ritual'' and emphasis on ``show rather than substance'' may
undercut genuine worship.
   Dalton of Cincinnati, an educator and vice president of Glenmary
Home Missioners who work extensively in the South, said: ``What I
see in Mr. or Mrs. Average Baptist sometimes saddens me. I see a
conversion experience in danger of becoming only a ritual of
`walking the aisle.'''
   In the South, Catholics ``tend to view you defensively, with
prejudice and with a certain amount of disdain, touched with an
envy of your buildings and your power,'' he said.
   ``In may ways Southern Baptists epitomize the American ethos,''
he said. ``Your danger is that you will fall into cultural
captivity and lose your prophetic edge of biblical strength.''
   Peck, manager of periodicals at the United Methodist Publishing
House in Nashville, said mainline denominations view Southern
Baptists as ``dominated by politics and polemics'' in controlling
their institutions.
   He said Southern Baptists tend to be more loyal to their
denomination than others, but he said the church is impoverished if
only people who agree that Scripture is without error are allowed
positions of leadership.
   ``Mainliners might envy your denomination for its evangelical
fervor, its compassion for others around the globe, its fine
publications, its healthy budgets and large membership, but they
would not trade all these together for freedom of thought,'' he
said.
   He said Southern Baptists ``seem more conservative, more
friendly and hospitable and yet less tolerant of the views of those
who differ with them.''

   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, the Democratic leaders who came out of
yesterday's first round of the budget talks indicated that before
they're going to advance any proposals at all for dealing with the
problem they want to hear first the administration's discussion of
how grave the problem is, and then an administration proposal or
set of proposals for dealing with it. Does the administration have
ready a set of budget proposals that would address the deficit
fully at this time?
   A: Not fully. But Dick Darman has already begun discussions,
after yesterday's meeting, with Congressman Gephardt, and I think
that the negotiation can go forward so that both sides come to the
table, say what they think, and we get an agreement. I'm confident
we can get one. But this mandating who does what first, that's not
going to get the job done.
   So, we're going to go up there, no preconditions, and have a
good discussion. And I think after there's some initial posturing
around, we're going to make some headway. We have to make some
headway.
   In terms of the magnitude of problem, I do feel that we have an
obligation to be sure the congressmen understand it. But, Brit, in
this sense of going out right now to the American people, I want to
go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the problem, say,
``Here's what the problem is and here's what the answer.'' And if I
go out there today, we don't have a bipartisan answer, and that's
the only way this problem's going to be solved. It's not going to
be done one party or another. And it is urgent enough. And when the
Congress sees the data and the estimates, and then CBO and OMB work
with the estimates, I'm convinced that we'll have enough of a sense
of urgency that we'll go forward and get a deal.
   Q: Well, Mr. President, surely you must recognize that part of
the reason why they're so wary is that they heard what they thought
were conflicting signals from the administration last week, you
saying, ``no preconditions,'' Gov. Sununu suggesting something
quite otherwise. First of all, what
   happened there? And second, what did you say to him about that?
   A: Well, I haven't said anything to him about it. But I've heard
conflicting signals out of Congress from the first day I said no
conditions, people trying to interpret what that meant, and a wide
array of blasts out of Congress on both sides of the aisle.
   But it doesn't help for me to do anything other than to cool it
down and say, ``Look, we've got a big problem. Here's the problem.
Let me explain it to you all as best OMB can. You tell us how CBO
sees it, then let's, as Lyndon said, `reason together' and try to
get a deal.'' And then make sure the American people understand how
serious it is.
   But Brit, I'm not going to go out there and try to _ and do
something that might inadvertently suggest crisis and _ and _ and
frighten markets. What I think we ought to do is come up, get
agreement on the size of the problem, and then have a bipartisan
answer. And this is very sensitive stuff.
   Right now, the markets are reasonably _ reasonably optimistic,
and there is _ there are reasons to be optimistic about the
economy. I've seen that earlier on, there were some predictions of
recession. But right now, it appears that most economists don't
think there will be a recession. So we are blessed by dealing with
this problem at a time of some growth; not the robust growth that
some of us would like to see, but with some growth. And yet,
there's still some concerns on the part of the Fed and others on
inflation. So I don't want to inadvertently send the wrong signals
to the markets.
   Yes, Charles?
   Q: Mr. President, Mr. Darman has already indicated that there is
little probability of getting all the cuts that are necessary, and
the problem is estimated at $100 billion. What is your
predisposition towards stretching out or amending Gramm-Rudman so
that you can do this at a (unintelligible) pace?
   A: Charles, I hate to _ it's a very good question, very direct,
and I'm not going to answer it, because I am not going to go out
there with a lot of suggestions to part of the problem. And I've
said that, I've agreed with the Congress, I think they're not
supposed to do that either.
   So we will conduct our discussions in private, and then we will
have recommendations. That might be part of it because this _ the
problem is pretty big. But I don't have a position on that, and I _
because I've said there are no preconditions.
   Yes?
   Q: Well, sir, actually, your spokesman, Mr. Fitzwater, has
listed some conditions. He says you wouldn't _
   A: Down with him! Down! He's _ (laughter) _
   Q: _ you wouldn't do anything on the budget deficit and you
wouldn't advocate any solutions that would be a drag on the
economy. My question to you is: Can you be persuaded that a tax
exists that would not be a drag on the economy? Do you know of any
such tax?
   A: John, you're trying to get me to do that which just one
second ago I said I wouldn't do. And I am trying to negotiate and
to keep the negotiating process in good faith. But I just can't _
if I start going into answering questions like that, no matter how
much merit they have, then I start having conditions, or
preconditions, and I can't do that and deal in good faith with the
Congress.
   Q: Can I ask you your concept _
   A: Yes?
   Q: _ of leadership on this?
   A: Yes.
   Q: You will n in the period
1947-1987 health care spending grew 2.5 percent faster per year
than other spending, and that it now consumes more than 11 percent
of the gross national product.
   That percentage compares with just 5 percent of GNP in 1947. It
comes at the expense of other areas of the economy, at the expense
of housing and education, for example. It robs funds from
environmental improvement.
   If trends continue, says Fuchs, a Stanford University health
economist, the percentage will reach 20 in a few decades. Right
now, he says, ``There is little prospect to substantially alter
this trend.''
   The problem has myriad causes, judging from the vast number
typically named by specialists in the field. Among them:
   High labor costs without increases in productivity, poor
hospital management, technological innovation, aging population,
poor health habits, third-party payments that remove patient
incentives to save.
   Fuchs, who is also a researcher at the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., observes that health care
wages have risen more rapidly than those of other workers, while
productivity gains have been slower.
   His figures show that net incomes of physicians rose about 8
percent a year in 1977-1987, while the wages of private,
nonagricultural workers rose about 5.5 percent a year.
   Many businesses are attacking the rising cost to them by
requiring workers to fund more of the bill for health insurance.
   A survey of 1,900 companies by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co., a
benefits consultant, showed 45 percent require contributions for
individual coverage vs. 39 percent in 1988.
   The same survey showed that individual deductibles, once
commonly placed at $100, are now often at $300, and that 72 percent
of employers require employees to pay some portion of hospital
charges, compared with 66 percent in 1988.
   Some smaller companies are putting their workers on the payrolls
of employee leasing companies, whose large number of workers allow
them to obtain lower health insurance rates and lower costs for
other benefits as well.
   Barry Kerr, director of Employee Leasing of New York, Inc.,
claims that ``our typical client reduces his medical insurances
costs anywere from 20 percent to 35 percent when we take over the
payroll.''
   Larger companies, and insurers too, also are becoming more aware
of the need to emphasize preventive medicine, to teach better
health habits, to convince employees to change destructive
lifestyles.
   A health and fitness survey of 2,000 employees at Steelcase
Inc., a Michigan manufacturing company, found that just 10 percent
of the employees accounted for 66 percent of the company's health
care costs.
   The study, conducted by the University of Michigan Fitness
Research Center, found that many of the worker's health problems
involved smoking, alcohol, drugs, high-fat diets, lack of exercise
and uncontrolled high blood pressure.
   More than half of all chronic diseases, including cancer and
heart disease, said the center's director, Prof. D.W. Edington, are
related to lifestyle. It is a rare company, nevertheless, that
offers incentives to better lifestyles.
   Without some fundamental change, it is obvious that health care
costs will eat like a cancer into other areas of the economy,
devouring funds once aimed at improving environment, child care,
housing, education and social issues.
   The Michigan findings provoked Prof. D.W. Edington, the center's
director, to make this comment:
   ``We are swiftly moving into an era of increasing conflict
between two prized American values _ access to health care and the
freedom to choose how we live. Something has to give.''

   A Senate committee approved a
$110-million-a-year anti-smoking bill Wednesday that would
encourage states to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes
to minors.
   The bill, approved 10-4 by the Labor and Human Resources
Committee, also would finance improvement of programs designed to
educate Americans about dangers of smoking. The government would be
authorized to buy advertisements encouraging non-smokers to avoid
the habit and smokers to stop.
   ``The bill ... will be a major step forward in our ongoing
battle to inform the public and reduce the high toll of death and
disability that smoking inflicts on our society,'' said Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the committee.
   The Bush administration last February called the legislation
unnecessary. The tobacco industry, which has been negotiating with
the committee staff to change some provisions, opposes the bill.
   ``As Senator Kennedy acknowledged today, a good deal of progress
was made during those discussions,'' said Walker Merryman, a
spokesman for the Tobacco Institute. He added, however, ``It is
clear that the previous weeks of discussions are not reflected in
this committee action.''
   Before the vote, the committee stripped away several points of
contention, including one provision that would have required a
label describing smoking as addictive.
   Kennedy said efforts to restore those provisions may be made
when the full Senate considers the bill. Most of the provisions
fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee,
rather than Kennedy's panel.
   Kennedy noted 44 states restrict the sale of tobacco to minors,
but said few states or communities enforce those laws.
   ``Retail establishments throughout the nation require proof of
age for the purchase of alcoholic beverages, but this step is
rarely required for tobacco products,'' he said. ``This bill will
encourage states to bring their retailers into compliance with
state laws.''
   The bill would set up grants to reward states for better
enforcement of laws that prohibit sale of tobacco to minors.
   Other parts of the legislation would:
   _Establish a Center for Tobacco Products in the Centers for
Disease Control. The center would expand federal anti-smoking
education and research such questions as why people smoke and why
some stop.
   _Set up a pilot program offering grants to help reduce workplace
smoking among groups, such as blue-collar workers, with a high
incidence of tobacco use.
   _Provide grants to states for distribution to elementary and
secondary schools to help create a smoke-free environment.
   _Set up a national program to provide information on how tobacco
use affects health. This would include money for creating
public-service announcements and paid commercials targeted on those
with the highest risks.
   _Require public disclosure of tobacco additives and how they
could affect health.

   Q: Is this the biggest test of your leadership on a domestic
problem?
   A: I expect so.
   Q: Mr. President, you are facing a deadline on a decision of
granting Most Favored Nation status to China.
   A: Yes.
   Q: Can you tell us, first of all, if you've made the call?
Secondly, if you haven't, what pressures do you face in terms of
once again rewarding China in the absence of significant
concessions or changes on their _ (off mike)?
   A: I have not made a decision on it. We are _ it's a _ that
issue is under _ under, I would say, lively discussion. I have seen
significant editorial comment that urges strongly against cutting
off MFN _ that comment coming from people that were quite critical
of me in the way I handled the student matter. In other words, they
would have preferred to see the Pelosi legislation as opposed to
the executive action that I took.
   There's another dimension that _ you asked how _ what the
thought process is here _ that relates to Hong Kong that is quite
important in terms of trade, a significant importance.
   Some of the people that opposed my earlier approach are urging
that MFN continue. And so, it isn't an easy call, because I don't
want to send a signal that we are happy with the human rights
record. We have considerable _ I still am of the mind that having
contact and working in an area where there has been progress on the
economic side with China is important. So, these are some of the
ingredients we're considering right now. But, it isn't _ it isn't
that clear a call for me yet.
   Q: Well, do you think that you might not grant Most Favored
Nation status as a way to signal them of the disappointment that
you've admitted to because they haven't changed that much after
Tiananmen Square?
   A: Well, I've _ I _ I am not suggesting that's what I plan to do.
   Yeah, Maureen.
   Q: Mr. President, a lot of Republicans, especially Republican
women, congresswomen, are wondering how you could threaten to veto
a bill that would guarantee job security to pregnant women and
other people with family emergencies, especially since every other
industrialized nation except South Africa has such a bill?
   A: I think it boils down to the concept of whether you are in
favor of mandated benefits or not, and one of the complaints I get
from our close proximity to the governors and working with the
governors is, ``Please don't mandate more benefits from the central
government.''
   So, we've had a difference. I've been quite open with my
concerns about that, and yet I have great respect for the
Republican women and others that you mentioned that differ with me
on that one.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, a few weeks ago, when the two hostages were
released, you said you hoped that it was the beginning of a
process. Has anything happened since then that's encouraged you
that a process is underway?
   A: No.
   Q: I mean, is it that blunt? I mean, is it worse than that? Does
it look like nothing has happened at all?
   A: I answered it as best I can. I see no reason to be encouraged
that the process is under way, but I think I said right in this
room, there were certain things we could do and we're trying to
follow up, things we can do without violating some fundamental
principles on negotiating or trading hostages for something. And
we're going forward there.
   I remember I mentioned the account of _ trying to account for
four Iranians that were taken and whom I _ our government feels are
dead, but the Iranians are very most interested in having an
accounting for that, and that's something I feel that we can move
forward on. So, we're trying to get more information, although they
didn't suggest and I can confirm that we had nothing to do with the
taking of those people, but it's a human _ it's a matter of human
concern to their families and all. So here's an area where we might
be able to facilitate matters there.

<HEAD>Study Shows AIDS Virus Test May Not Find Many Who Are Infected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many people who test negative for the AIDS
virus may actually be infected, according to a study published
Wednesday.
   Dr. Tab Ansari of Emory University in Atlanta said his
laboratory tested the blood of 165 people who had tested negative
for the AIDS virus and found that 30 were, in fact, infected.
   He said in an interview that the study raises the possibility
that there are people who are chronically infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, but who never get sick
or develop easily found antibodies.
   In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Science, Ansari said his team used a new type of test to find
HIV antibodies that had escaped detection by routine hospital
laboratory blood tests.
   ``All of the ones that they found positive, we found positive,''
Ansari said. ``But in addition, there were quite a few that were
negative in their assay that were picked up as positive.''
   Ansari said the experiment began with 165 blood samples tested
using ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the AIDS test
most commonly used in hospitals and clinics. The samples then were
additionally tested using the Western Blot assay, a test routinely
used to confirm the ELISA finding.
   All of the samples tested in that traditional way were found
negative for the HIV virus, according to the study.
   Meanwhile, unlabeled blood from the same samples, along with
blood specimens from healthy volunteers, were provided to Ansari
and his team. His team did not know which samples came from a
high-risk population _ mostly drug users _ and which came from
healthy volunteers.
   The specimens were subjected to a test called the pokeweed
mitogen assay, a procedure that forces specialized cells in the
blood to expel antibodies into the blood serum. The serum then was
tested using the ELISA and Western Blot assays.
   Thirty of the samples, or 18 percent, were found to contain
antibodies to the HIV virus, an indication of infection. Each of
those 30 samples were previously found by the two standard tests to
be free of virus antibodies.
   Ansari said the routine tests would give positive results only
if HIV antibodies are in the blood serum. The pokeweed mitogen
assay, he said, shows that there may be infected people who don't
develop serum antibodies to the AIDS virus.
   ``For some reason there are blood cells that have the antibody,
but do not secrete it,'' Ansari said, adding that the ELISA and
Western Blot tests would not be able to detect the antibodies.
   The study, similar findings by other researchers and studies of
viral infections in monkeys suggest that some people may contract
the HIV infection but never progress to the actual AIDS disese, he
said.
   ``We need to follow up these people and study their immunity and
then perhaps we could understand how that happens,'' he said.
   Ansari, however, emphasized that the possible existence of
hidden, chronic HIV infections that never progess to disease is
only speculation.
   A National Institutes of Health researcher, who asked not to be
named, said Ansari's study confirms the suggestions of other
researchers ``that people can be latently infected and not test
positive for the virus.''
   The Emory study, Ansari said, should not be interpreted to mean
that blood donated for transfusion, which is tested with the ELISA
assay, is unsafe.
   He said all of the blood that tested positive in his study came
from people ``at very high risk for HIV'' and that those people
would be excluded through an interview process from donating blood.

   Marilyn Quayle and actress Lynda Carter on
Wednesday urged entire families to take part in the race for cancer
research.
   ``Let's face it, more than one life is touched when breast
cancer rears its ugly head,'' Mrs. Quayle told the House
subcommittee on health and long-term care.
   The topic of breast cancer is a personal one for Mrs. Quayle,
who lost her mother, Mary Tucker, to the disease at age 56. She has
said that her mother might have been spared a painful death had the
disease been detected earlier.
   The wife of Vice President Dan Quayle also urged members of the
panel and invited the public to participate in the ``Race for the
Cure,'' a 5 kilometer run or walk to benefit cancer research,
detection and education.
   The race is scheduled for June 16 down Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Ms. Carter, star of the old ``Wonder Woman'' TV series, told of
a close friend who was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.
   ``What if she hadn't had the mammogram?'' Ms. Carter asked.
``Today she would be walking around condemned, condemned to death.''
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House panel, noted
recent health statistics that indicate 43,000 women may die of
breast cancer in 1990, including more than a quarter over age 75.
   He promised Mrs. Quayle he will take part in the race but said
he will likely walk not run.

   Actress Angie Dickinson, who has shed a drop or
two of perspiration under studio lights, testified on behalf of a
man who claims GTE Products Corp. stole his secret process for a
cool studio light.
   Filming with Cool Light ``took less time because I could stay in
the scenes longer without needing to be repaired,'' the star of the
1970s TV show ``Police Woman'' testified Tuesday, the first day of
the testimony in the federal court trial.
   She also said the lighting system required less equipment and
was easier to use on locations.
   She testified for George Panagiotou, of Los Angeles, who claims
GTE broke an agreement under which he gave the company production
secrets for the light.
   GTE has denied the allegations. ``There were no trade secrets,
period,'' said Richard H. Dowhan, GTE public affairs manager. ``GTE
did not steal anything. There was no contract between us and the
plaintiff, so there should be no damages awarded.''

   Actor Don Johnson says he called
upon his experience acting as a cop in TV's ``Miami Vice'' when he
confronted an intruder in his hotel room and ordered the man to the
floor.
   Johnson said Tuesday he was alarmed when he saw the man going
through bags in his room at the Hotel Bel-Air on Jan. 29, 1989, and
that his first thoughts were for the safety of his wife, actress
Melanie Griffith, and son Jesse.
   ``I could tell (the man) was taken by surprise. ... He said `I'm
a fan, I'm a fan,''' Johnson testified. He said he told the man to
``Shut up'' and ordered him to lie on the floor and put his hands
behind his head until security guards arrived.
   The tesimony came in the trial of Henry Kenneth Rosenbaum, 36,
who has pleaded innocent to burglary.

   Soul singer James Brown sang a medley
of his hits and lectured students at a beauty school on the
importance of education during his first appearance as a counselor
in a prison work-release program.
   His supervisor, meanwhile, has denied reports he solicited
monetary contributions from reporters in exchange for granting
interviews with the singer.
   Brown works as a community liaison and counselor with the
Aiken-Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission under a
work-release program he entered last month.
   The singer was transferred to the minimum-security Lower
Savannah Work Release Center after serving 15 months of a six-year
sentence for aggravated assault and avoiding police during a
two-state, high-speed car chase in 1988.
   The 57-year-old Brown debuted as a counselor Tuesday at the
25-student Jack's Beauty College.
   The ``Godfather of Soul'' was inspiring, said school owner Kay
F. Brown, no relation to the singer. ``He talked to the students
about the importance of education and being independent rather than
dependent.''
   Brown's remarks were aimed primarily at the seven beauty school
students participating in the Job Training Partnership Act, which
provides tuition and materials to help low-income students learn a
trade or vocation.
   Brown, sporting a bright green and white striped shirt and a tan
suit, also sang an impromptu medley of his songs, according to Mrs.
Brown. Reporters were not permitted to attend the lecture.
   A report in this week's People Magazine says work-release
supervisor George Anderson solicited contributions from reporters
in exchange for arranging an interview with Brown.
   ``That's totally false,'' said Anderson, executive director of
the Aiken-Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission.
   Anderson said he never asks for contributions when screening
Brown's interviews, but he does explain that the singer is working
for a non-profit agency that serves the poor and elderly in three
counties.

   A lawsuit by Johnny Carson's first wife asking
for more alimony may be foiled because she remarried after
divorcing Carson, a judge said.
   Joan ``Jody'' Carson, the mother of the talk-show host's three
sons, wed Donald Buckley, an ad executive, seven years after she
divorced Carson.
   The remarriage is a ``little glitch in the case,'' said Justice
Phyllis Gangel-Jacob, who reserved decision in the case.
   Carson and his first wife married in 1949 and divorced in 1963.
In 1970, Mrs. Carson said, they agreed that she would receive
$13,500 a year until 1999 whether she remarried or not.
   Mrs. Carson married Buckley 15 days after signing the 1970
agreement. They divorced six years later and she got a $200,000
lump sum settlement.
   Mrs. Carson says she can't live on $13,500 but acknowledged she
has almost $400,000 in the bank.

   Radical Russian lawmakers began a fight Wednesday
to win more power for the Soviet Union's largest republic and said
they want to elect Communist maverick Boris Yeltsin as their
republic's president.
   ``Either Russia will be a supporting part of the Soviet empire
or the Russian Federation will be independent in economic,
political and cultural fields,'' lawmaker Oleg Rumyanstev said at
the opening of the Russian republic's congress.
   The Russian reformers seek greater control over their republic's
economic and political affairs, which are now almost entirely
controlled by the national bureaucracy.
   ``Either it's allowed to be free, or someone from Moscow will
dictate everything,'' said Rumyanstev, a leader of the newly formed
Social Democratic Party. He spoke during a break in the opening
session, which was devoted largely to procedural matters.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said some Russian lawmakers
are demanding independence, like the three Baltic republics and
groups in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Ukraine.
   Russian news media regularly discuss sovereignty, which they say
would give the republics greater rights as members of a less
centrally controlled Soviet Union.
   The Russian republic is the heart of the Soviet Union. It
includes Moscow, 52 percent of the nation's population, and
three-quarters of its land, from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific
Ocean. Russian is the Soviet Union's dominant language.
   Russia is by far the largest of the 15 Soviet republics. It
embraces 11 time zones and the vast oil, gas, mineral and gold
reserves of Siberia. Many Russians feel their wealth supports the
other republics.
   In the race for the new post of president of Russia, a Yeltsin
victory could mean a loss of face for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, because Yeltsin is his most popular rival. Yeltsin has
advanced his career by criticizing Gorbachev and the privileges of
the party elite.
   Gorbachev has thrown his support in the race to current Russian
Premier Alexander Vlasov.
   Gorbachev emphasized the importance of this battle by spending
all day Wednesday silently observing the opening session's debate
in the Grand Kremlin Palace. Legislators said organizational
matters could easily postpone the presidential election until
Friday.
   If Yeltsin and the radicals win control of the Russian congress,
they plan to seek changes in the Russian constitution that would
clash with the national charter. Some would follow the Baltic
example in demanding that laws of the Russian republic take
priority over national ones.
   ``Russia has no rights. It follows the lead of the center, it
has no policies of its own, foreign or domestic,'' Yeltsin said at
a rally Monday. ``It's time the central government stopped biting
pieces off Russia. Fifty percent of its population lives at or
below the poverty level.''
   Political allegiances in the Congress of the Russian Federation
probably will remain unclear until the lawmakers elect their
chairman, popularly known as the president of the republic.
   Yeltsin has estimated that he and Vlasov each would win 30
percent of the votes. The rest are up for grabs, he said.
   Other possible contenders are lesser-known figures: Yuri
Manayenkov, a Communist Party secretary; Ivan Polozkov, a hard-line
opponent of free enterprise; and Arkady Volksy, who for more than a
year headed the Communist Party committee that ran the ethnically
torn Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in the Caucasus Mountains.
   Yeltsin, 58, was ousted from his job as Moscow Communist Party
chief and his slot in the party Politburo two years ago after
criticizing Gorbachev and party privileges. But he made a comeback
by winning 89 percent of the popular vote to represent Moscow in
the national parliament.
   Both Yeltsin and Vlasov have taken up the issue of Russian
sovereignty in their platforms.
   Vlasov told Soviet television that the republic, not the
national government, should control its natural resources. He also
said all forms of ownership should be encouraged in agriculture, an
implied endorsement of private land ownership, still forbidden by
Soviet law.

<HEAD>Report Accuses Army of Cruelty in Deaths of Palestinian Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights report published Thursday said
159 Arab children were killed and as many as 63,000 wounded by
bullets, beatings and tear gas during the first two years of the
Palestinian uprising.
   The study, sponsored by the Swedish Save the Children group,
claimed Israel's army practiced ``calculated cruelty'' in some
cases, and it urged international protection of Palestinian
children.
   The findings were rejected by the office of Brig. Gen. Nachman
Shai, the army spokesman, and criticized by Israeli human rights
activists as one-sided.
   Maj. Moshe Fogel, an army spokesman, said pro-PLO activists used
children as shields during protests and were responsible for their
injuries.
   ``We are faced with an uprising which turns its children into
martyrs and actually encourages minors to participate in violent
activities against Israeli soldiers, whether actively or
passively,'' he said.
   Thomas Hammarberg, head of the Swedish group and a former
secretary-general of Amnesty International, said Israeli leaders
failed to investigate abuses adequately and gave soldiers the
impression they could do as they liked.
   ``It could be the soldiers believe plastic and rubber-coated
bullets are non-lethal,'' he said in an interview. ``But I think it
begins to take the form of the intentional if they let it continue
when they know the consequences.''
   The report said 159 children, aged 16 and under, were killed in
the first two years of the uprising against Israeli rule of the
occupied lands. The uprising began in December 1987. The report
said 106 of the 159 children were shot to death. So far this year,
13 children have been shot to death, the report said.
   The army says 79 children under the age of 14 were fatally
wounded in the last 29 months. It does not have a figure for
victims 16 and under.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories says 148 children 16 and under had died through May 1.
Spokeswoman Zahava Galon said tear gas deaths were excluded as too
difficult to substantiate and that no reliable injury estimates
were available.
   The army disputed the report's claim that ``the vast majority''
of soldiers were not punished for wrongdoing. Fogel said soldiers
were court-martialed or disciplined for improper use of force in 25
percent of the fatality cases of children recorded by the army.
   He said army investigations were hampered because Palestinians
often take bodies before autopsies can be performed and Arab
witnesses refuse to cooperate with army investigators.
   The three-volume, 1008-paged study was written by Anne Elizabeth
Nixon, former deputy director of the American Save the Children
program in Israel. It was funded by a Ford Foundation grant.
   The report examined how children 16 and under suffered physical
injuries and the effects of collective punishments such as school
closures, curfews, house demolitions, raids and economic sanctions.
   It concluded: ``In view of the Palestinian community's
difficulty in protecting its children and the inadequacy of
safeguards dependent upon Israeli government enforcement,
protection of Palestinian children...becomes an urgent matter in
need of immediate consideration by the international community.''
   Joshua Schoffman, an Israeli civil rights lawyer, said the study
had ``serious flaws'' because it relied too heavily on Palestinian
sources.
   ``Just as one has to treat army announcements with skepticism,
you have to treat Palestinian testimony with skepticism and balance
the two,'' he said.
   Among the findings:
   _52 percent of the children killed were not in the vicinity of a
protest when they were fatally injured.
   _Children accounted for 21 percent of all deaths and 38 percent
of all injuries and deaths combined. By AP count, 687 Palestinians
have been killed along with 43 Israelis.
   _The average age of children killed was 10 years.
   _About one in every 15 to 20 children in the occupied lands was
injured, totalling 50,000 to 63,000.

   Senegalese President Abdou Diouf said
Wednesday the United States could hasten an end to dictatorships in
Africa by withholding aid to countries which do not tolerate
opposition parties.
   ``This might be a way to assist a quicker coming of democracy to
our continent,'' Diouf told a gathering at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a private research group.
   Diouf, who met with President Bush earlier this week, said
Senegal is committed to a democratic course, pointing out that 17
parties operate in his country.
   He is highly regarded in Washington because of his conservative
economic policies, support for an African common market and
generally pro-Western views.
   Diouf said that in light of the demise of communism in Eastern
Europe last year, Marxist parties in Senegal have become
``political invertebrates.''

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was
hospitalized on Wednesday after complaining of weakness and will be
held several days for tests and observation, an official said.
   Begin, 76, was in stable condition at Jerusalem's Shaarei Tzedek
Hospital, according to its deputy chief, Dr. Motti Lifshitz.
   Begin, who led Israel to peace with Egypt and war in Lebanon,
was last hospitalized in August for treatment of a salt shortage in
his system.
   ``Mr. Begin did not feel well this morning. His doctor, Ephraim
Meltzer...checked him and decided to hospitalize him for
observation and tests,'' Lifshitz said on Israel radio.
   He refused to disclose details on Begin's illness. Begin has
been hospitalized several times since resigning in August 1983,
including for prostate surgery and general weakness.
   In an earlier interview broadcast on Israel army radio, Lifshitz
said Begin would remain in Shaarei Tzedek for several days.
   ``The tests will determine how we shall proceed,'' he said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Devorah Waysman told The Associated Press
that Begin arrived in an ambulance with members of his family.
   ``We thought it was better to have him where the facilities are
on hand,'' she said, refusing to release any further details.
   Begin became prime minister in 1977 and resigned abruptly in
August 1983. Aides said at the time he was depressed over the death
of his wife, Aliza, and Israel's protracted involvement in Lebanon
following the June 1982 invasion.
   He has lived in virtual seclusion since his retirement, making
public radio comments only occasionally on important political
developments or anniversaries of historic events.
   Begin was last seen in public in November, when he prayed at a
memorial service for his late wife on the Mount of Olives cemetery
in Jerusalem.

   Arizona's Senate approved a state holiday
honoring Martin Luther King, sending the bill to the House for a
vote today despite demands that the racially sensitive issue be put
to the voters.
   The Senate voted 16-14 Tuesday to create a paid King holiday for
state employees and restore a paid Columbus Day holiday. The
measure would replace a law signed last year replacing Columbus Day
with King Day.
   The House gave the measure tentative approval on a voice vote,
and Gov. Rose Mofford said she would sign it after a formal vote
later today.
   But opponents said they would gather signatures for a
referendum. They would have 90 days to do so, and polls suggest
that more than 80 percent of Arizonans believe the issue should be
decided by the voters.
   Opponents say an extra holiday would cost the state $500,000 to
$3.5 million. Supporters point to a January report that conventions
and meetings canceled because of years of fighting over a King
holiday cost the state about $25 million in 1987-88.
   The measure's chief Senate sponsor, Democrat Carolyn Walker,
said there was no need to let the voters have a say in what could
become a racially divisive referendum.
   ``I know there are those who say we are taking this away from
the people,'' she said. ``I would like to remind them that ... the
people elected us in the state of Arizona as leaders.''
   Republican Sen. Doug Todd said votes against the holiday had
helped build ``a Berlin Wall ... of fear, bigotry and hatred.''
   Last year's King-for-Columbus bill so angered King opponents and
Columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly
twice the 43,350 signatures needed to hold a referendum in
November. The law was suspended in the meantime.
   Approval of the new bill would wipe out that referendum but
could lead to another.
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached in 1988 and is
running again, has promised to put thousands of his volunteers into
the field to help gather signatures. He says the issue isn't King
but the people's right to vote.
   Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a King holiday in 1986,
but Mecham rescinded it days before it would have taken effect.
   Forty-seven other states have a holiday honoring King. The other
states without official King holidays are Montana and New Hampshire.

<HEAD>Dole Moves to Force Retirement Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole moved Wednesday
to force Americans making a career change to transfer their pension
benefits to a new retirement account rather than spending the cash.
   The proposal, announced at a conference of the Association of
Private Pension and Welfare Plans, would have to be approved by
Congress.
   Mrs. Dole said 80 percent of Americans who receive retirement
savings in a lump sum when they change jobs spend it rather than
put it in a new retirement plan.
   Under Mrs. Dole's plan to promote ``pension portability,'' a
worker's former employer would be required to transfer pension
savings to the worker's new pension plan or an Individual
Retirement Account.
   The worker could retrieve the cash if it went into an IRA, but
would have to pay a penalty.
   A worker could not get to the money if it were transferred to a
new pension plan. Savings would be routed to a new pension plan or
an IRA depending on what kind of pension plan the worker had.
   ``We, as a nation, consume too much and save too litte,'' Mrs.
Dole said, adding that the change would ``ensure that workers can
continue to achieve tax-free buildup on more of their retirement
savings.''
   Mrs. Dole said the nature of the workforce was changing.
   ``The days of working for one employer for 30 to 40 years are
now the exception and not the rule,'' she said.
   Each year, one in five working Americans changes jobs and one in
10 changes careers, Mrs. Dole said. Some experts predict the
average worker will soon hold up to 10 jobs during his or her
career, she said.
   Mrs. Dole also called for expanding pension coverage for
employees of small businesses so that as many as 5.5 million more
American workers would be covered.
   Businesses with fewer than 25 workers _ often unable to provide
complicated pension plans _ now may let their employees participate
in ``Simplified Employee Pensions,'' which allow workers to defer
up to nearly $8,000 of their pre-tax salary by contributing it to
IRAs.
   Mrs. Dole is proposing expanding that program to businesses with
50 or fewer workers.

<HEAD>Eastern Europe's Economic Problems Likely to Worsen</HEAD>

   Dire economic problems in Eastern Europe are
likely to worsen, bringing recession, unemployment and consumer
shortages, a CIA report said Wednesday.
   The report, released by members of the congressional Joint
Economic Committee, said the newly emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe could be rocked by unrest if the public is unwilling to
accept hardships for years to come.
   ``The public's tolerance for prolonged austerity will be the key
to the success of the reforms, and it remains largely untested,
even in Poland,'' the report said.
   ``As long as aggressive implementation of austerity measures
coincides with consumer shortages and a prolonged decline in living
standards, there will be a risk of public protest that could set
back reforms and economic recovery,'' CIA analysts wrote in their
report.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the report underscored that the
``road to economic well-being will be long and arduous'' for the
nations of Eastern Europe.
   Unemployment will be a big problem as countries try to transform
their centrally planned economies into those dominated by market
forces.
   ``Unemployment is likely to soar if the new governments
vigorously pursue plans to break up large single-enterprise state
monopolies, restructure their economies ... eliminate state
subsidies and let the market determine winners and losers,'' the
report said.
   In Poland, joblessness could easily exceed 1.5 million, or 9
percent, the study said. Unemployment is forecast at 15 to 20
percent in East Germany and Yugoslavia, and 5 percent or more in
Bulgaria and Hungary.
   The new democracies have economic hangovers because of four
decades of economic mismanagement under communist governments.
   The problems include ``slow or stagnant growth, declining
productivity, energy-intensive and obsolete heavy industries, heavy
foreign debts, poor-quality goods and non-competitive exports,
massive environmental problems and deteriorating infrastructures,
to name a few.''
   Others economic problems also threaten Eastern Europe, the
analysts said.
   For instance, heavy debt burdens and poor prospects for
increasing export revenues will make it difficult for countries to
pay their debts and modernize their economies.
   Then, countries will have to determine how to distribute wealth,
the report said. The struggle over privatization could be intense.
   On top of the economic squeeze is the inexperience of the new
governments, some of which are coalitions of divergent groups, the
CIA report said.
   Western nations will play a big role in getting the new
democracies on their feet with financial aid and private
investment, the study said, adding that joint ventures are viewed
as particularly crucial.
   While governments seem eager to help Eastern Europe, long-term
economic development will depend on how much private investment
pours into the region, it said. Bank lending to the region already
shows signs of drying up, the report said.
   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University professor who has worked
with the Polish government, said the United States must move to
become actively involved in development of the Soviet Union.
   ``Let's make clear to the Soviet Union that we will support
economic reform in a measured, careful way,'' he said.
   It is important for the Soviets to know _ at a time of great
insecurity and uncertainty _ that there ``is help out there,''
Sachs said.
   Last weekend, President Bush proposed spending $300,000 to start
up a volunteer corps to provide assistance to the democracies in
Eastern Europe.
   A similar proposal was introduced in the Senate in March by
Sens. David Pryor, D-Ark.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; and Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...matters there.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, if you cut taxes or if you cut _ if you raise
taxes, I'm sorry, or if you cut spending, either way there will be
a drag on the economy unless interest rates also fall. Are you
operating under an assumption or some kind of guarantee from the
Fed that that will happen?
   A: No, there's no such guarantee. I'd like to see interest rates
falling, and I think when you have a _ when the fears of inflation
decline, one might expect interest rates to come down. But no, I
have no such guarantee.
   Q: Are you taking, then, a gamble that even if you come up with
some kind of package, that it won't help the actual _ the economic
performance?
   A: Well, I think you raise a very good economic question, and
that is how much can be taken out of an economy, what percentage of
the GNP can be taken out in terms of taxes and not threaten the
dynamism of the economy? And one figure that I've heard bandied
about is _ I want to be careful here, but I'd say about 1 or _
we're growing at _ what? _ 2 percent. And of each _ now it looks
like we're growing at 2 percent growth GNP. And I'd say anything
over half of that would be very _ you know, risk doing what you
say, slowing down the economy further, and that's exacerbating the
problem rather than making it better.
   Yeah, Jerry?
   Q: Mr. President, if I could return to the budget negotiations
for a second. There's a lot of speculation of _ without getting
into the details of the negotiations _ about why you personally
decided the matter was urgent enough now to resort to this process.
Is it because you're afraid interest rates might stop the economic
growth that you want so much? Is it because the automatic spending
cuts would be too painful for the country to absorb? Or are you
just frustrated that the deficit continues to restrict your ability
to maneuver on a lot of issues?
   A: Well, I think _ I want to say almost all of the above, but
it's really that when you take a look at the most recent estimates
_ and one of the ingredients in the shortfall has been interest
rates _ is that the problem is of such a magnitude that we need to
address it. It's more that than it is a fear of any specific
category; it's just big enough that we have to do something about
it. And that's why I've taken the approach I have taken.
   And I think _ but in here, you see, it is a place where we need
to get understanding from the American people. But I want to go
there saying, ``Look, here's the problem. Everybody's agreed on it
now. We're not going to have some new organization come in and
argue with the estimates.'' And that means getting CBO and the OMB
together as much as possible. ``Here's a bipartisan answer, taking
a compromise here, give and take there, and this is what we must do
as a nation on the deficit.'' And I'm hopeful that we will be able
to come forward with such an agreement that will enable me to do
that.
   Q: Do you have a timetable of your own?
   A: No. We talked about a timetable this morning, Jerry, but we
didn't do _ that has not been agreed with Congress. And, again, I
want to work with them on these answers, not do it just in the _
   Yeah, Owen?
   Q: For some time you've hinted, Mr. President, that you would
ban off-shore oil drilling off the coast of Florida. Can you tell
us where you are now on that decision, as well as the issue in
California?
   A: A while back I said ``weeks'' and not ``months.'' And today
I'll say ``days'' and not ``weeks'' because we just finished, just
concluded a meeting with those Cabinet departments that have
recommendations to make to the president, and now we've got to sort
it out internally. But I can't give you an exact date, but we're
getting very close to making recommendations in that regard.
   Q: Can you tell me, is there a big difference in how you see the
situation in Florida compared with California?
   A: Well, I think I've already said that I'm concerned about the
_ the _ the environmental aspects as it relates to Florida, albeit
the drilling, as I was told this morning, if quite a ways off shore
_ the projected, the leases are. But that is a highly sophisticated
and sensitive area, and so I've already said that, but I don't want
to suggest that I don't feel that way about certain areas off
California.
   Another aspect of all this is the overall energy requirements of
the country. And regrettably, I'm going to have to make a decision
on this, or feel compelled to, before we have our whole energy
study, which is quite important. And _ but I have to go forward,
anyway, without that, and it's too bad. I am increasingly concerned
about our dependence on foreign oil. So it is my responsibility,
then, to balance out these needs.
   Two more _ right _ John and Jesse, and then I've got to go.
   Q: Mr. President, I know you're _ as a former member of the
House, that you know it's not unusual for legislation to be loaded
down with amendments. Have you exhausted all administrative relief
for _ possibility of relief for Panama and Nicaragua and
contingency funds?
   A: Yes, we have. And we looked _ I tasked the Treasury, upon
hearing from Mrs. Chamorro, to see if there is some way to arrange
a bridge loan. And as I said in my statement, regrettably, you
can't make a bridge loan based on the _ on _ on pending
legislation, in other words, using pending legislation to bridge
it, to pay it off. And so we've tried very hard on that. Indeed, I
asked, through General Scowcroft, the Secretary of the Treasury to
see if we couldn't encourage private lending to help Violetta get
across this difficult problem. And they run into collateral
problems as well. So, it is a matter of dire urgency. And it's _
   Q: Did you tell the Democratic leaders that yesterday?
   A: Yes, I did.
   Q: (Could I ask you ?) What did they say?
   A: Well, they said they'd try very hard. And with fairness to
Speaker Foley, I talked to Congressman Jamie Whitten about it. And
it is very frustrating. And I think the American people are
frustrated by the inability of the Congress to do business in a
prompt and orderly fashion. I believe this has the support of the
American people.
   Yeah, Jesse, and then I really do have to run.

   Plans to shut down Radio Free Europe should be
drafted now in the hope that democratic institutions become rooted
in Eastern Europe, an advisory panel recommended Wednesday.
   In its annual report, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public
Diplomacy said also that congressional directives to establish such
services as TV Marti, which broadcasts to Cuba, reduce the
flexibility needed to meet programming opportunities in Eastern
Europe.
   The panel said Radio Free Europe broadcasts probably should
eventually come to an end. However, it added that U.S. government
radio, which has been broadcasting from West Germany since the end
of World War II, should continue operating in a united Germany.
   The continued broadcasts would serve as a ``major source of
information about democracy and the United States'' for the 16
million East Germans who would join a united Germany, the report
said.
   Radio Free Europe, whose broadcasts to Eastern Europe have
spanned four decades of Cold War, will have achieved its goals ``if
democratic trends in Eastern Europe are sustained,'' the panel said.
   In addition, the commission said, a strategy should be developed
now for transferring Radio Free Europe's assets to the Voice of
America, whose broadcasts it said will become more important than
ever.
   The change should be made when democratic institutions and free
media alternatives are well established in the region, the panel
said.
   It added, however, that Radio Free Europe should continue
broadcasting while the possibility exists that the current wave of
democratization could be reversed.
   Radio Free Europe was set up in 1950 with funds from the CIA.
Control was transferred to the independent Board for International
Broadcasting in 1951. The radio service and Radio Liberty, a
companion service that broadcasts to the Soviet Union, operate
under an annual budget of about $400 million.
   The bipartisan advisory panel was established by Congress to
oversee the international public affairs and educational exchange
programs of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Information
Agency.
   The panel said it deplored what it called a lack of cohesion and
high-level commitment to public diplomacy within the Bush
administration and called on the president to establish a National
Council on Public Diplomacy to coordinate efforts.
   It said USIA had been ``disappointingly slow'' in developing
programs to take advantage of the collapse of rigid communist
regimes in Eastern Europe.
   It said the agency's work will become increasingly important as
ideological and military competition is replaced by a focus on
economic, cultural and communications issues.
   The panel recommended also that:
   _USIA's broadcast media emphasize ``democracy in action,''
originating programs on the rule of law, the role of a free press,
and adjusting national interests to ethnic differences. Those, it
said, should combine with a range of programs that tell listeners
how to organize a political party, run a public meeting, write a
constitution or start a small business.
   _Emphasis be placed on English language instruction.
   _Commissions should be established in the newly democratic
countries of Eastern Europe to begin and expand long-term scholarly
exchanges.
   _Potential foreign public reaction to proposed policies should
play a part in all major policy decisions.

<HEAD>Authors Link Low-level Radiation to Increased U.S. Death Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions more Americans may have died from the
effects of radiation releases from nuclear plants and bomb tests
than acknowledged by the government, the authors of a new book on
the health effects of radiation said Wednesday.
   A spokeswoman for the commercial nuclear industry called the
claim ``hysterical fear-mongering.''
   Benjamin A. Goldman and Jay M. Gould, authors of ``Deadly
Deceit,'' said their analysis of government mortality and radiation
statistics showed death rates for infants and the elderly rose
significantly in the aftermath of accidental radiation releases at
nuclear plants in South Carolina, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in
the 1970s.
   Goldman, a researcher and author, and Gould, a statistician,
also claim that radioactive fallout from the explosion of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union in April 1986
accelerated the deaths of about 40,000 Americans during the summer
of 1986.
   As the basis for this claim the authors cite government
statistics that showed a 5.3 percent increase in reported U.S.
deaths in May 1986 compared with May 1985. They said this was the
biggest May increase in 50 years and that the odds of this being a
chance event unrelated to Chernobyl were less than one in 1,000.
   The book also contends that deaths related to fallout from
above-ground nuclear tests, which were banned in 1963, may be far
in excess of any previous estimates.
   The authors reached this conclusion on the basis of national
mortality tables that showed a steady decline in death rates in the
United States until the 1950s, when the rate flattened out. The
rate resumed falling after the early 1960s.
   This 10-year period of little or no improvement in the death
rate coincided with the height of the U.S. and Soviet atmospheric
nuclear testing programs.
   ``We have estimated that this mid-century mortality failure
could have been measured as equivalent to 9 million `excess'
deaths, as the difference between the observed number and what
would be expected on the basis of pre-1950s trends,'' Gould told a
news conference.
   The authors said they could not be entirely sure of the accuracy
of their conclusions since they were formed on the basis of
``statistical anomalies'' and not scientific investigation of links
between radiation doses and human health.
   ``If it is not low-level radiation that caused this, then it is
up to the scientific community to explain what in God's name
accounted for this,'' Gould said.
   Cathy Roche, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, the nuclear industry trade group, said the assertions by
Gould and Goldman had been made previously and debunked by state
and federal health authorities. She said the authors have an
anti-nuclear bias that skewed their analysis.

   Q: Mr. President, many of the participants from yesterday's
budget meeting came out shaking their heads and scratching their
heads in frustration at the size of the problem, as you've just
talked about here, the magnitude of the deficit problem, and the
lack of trust that appeared to be in the room. In fact, one of the
participants said they all turned back their paper that they had
written notes on so that no one would be able to quote from them.
And they all said they _ it's going to take a lot of _
   A: That was a heartening development, Jessica.
   Q: _ a lot of leadership. I'm wondering, what is it that you
think you can do that can move the atmosphere forward, the
atmosphere of trust first of all, so that people will believe in
the good faith that you are expressing?
   A: I think there was _ I think there was a meeting that involved
a fair degree of trust. I don't think people think I'm trying to
blindside them in the Congress. That might have been early on when
I first said, ``Let's go. No preconditions.'' But I didn't get the
feeling of distrust. And when people headed _ handed the papers
back, it was so the process could work in an orderly fashion. And
it wasn't the Republicans that suggested it, as I recall, it was a
Democratic leader, who said, ``Just leave these and let our group
that's going to meet on Thursday discuss these matters and discuss
it in a, you know, as quiet a surrounding as possible without
having a big flurry out there surrounding the discussions.'' And so
I think that _ I interpreted that as a determination to work
together, Jessica, not the other way. I hope I'm right.
   Q: But they all say that there's a stalemate about how to
address the one side of the equation, the tax side of the equation,
that's going to take leadership to move things. Someone's going to
have to move first. Now, do you have some _
   A: That's what the process will do, no tricks, no tricks in the
bag. But when you start a negotiation, a labor management
negotiation, they get behind closed doors and they say, ``Now look,
here's our view and what is yours?'' and reasonable people go
forward and try to negotiate. So, I think the Democrats did come
down, some of them, saying, ``Well, you should go first.''
   And I said to them, ``Wait a minute. Who appropriates all the
money, where's the revenue, who's got the obligation under the
Constitution to raise the revenue? So, let's not talk about who's
going first.''
   We've got a problem. We have a national problem. And I want to
be a part of having the American people understand the problem, and
I want to have an answer to the American people that I know can
work.
   And it's not going to work with just Republicans or just the
White House or just the Democrats.
   So, I think we got over that hurdle _ I hope we did _ of
suspicion, and I'm trying very hard here today, because these are
good, tough questions about procedure and substance, and I am not
going to get into those. I am going to try to keep my share of the
bargain by not discussing what we might do or might not do, what my
bottom line is, what my opening wedge is, because once I do that,
you'll have 435 people in the House doing it and 100 in the Senate.
And that isn't the way we're going to solve this national problem.
   Thank you all very, very much.
   Q: _ another one on the Philippines.
   A: Philippines?
   Q: Yes. Do we need those bases there now as much as we did in
the past?
   A: I thought our negotiator made a very sound statement, Rich
Armitage, on the Philippines. Because what he pointed out is, there
_ we don't have a total blank check regarding this.
   And there's another point he made, and if we're not wanted
there, we're not going to be there. And so, this isn't something
that is absolutely essential to the United States. It is _ those
are great facilities, those two facilities, and we will negotiate
in good faith, but there are certain parameters, there are certain
limits to what I will do, what I will accept, as president. And
it's very important that, in dealing in good faith, that the
Philippine government and its leaders know that and I _ that's why
I strongly support what Rich Armitage said, or what I saw that he
said, on the television, which is almost that.
   Q: Will we be able to protect our interests in the Pacific if
we're thrown out of the Philippines?
   A: Yeah, there are other ways to skin this cat, but some of them
are quite expensive and some of them are less expensive. But you
can be assured, I am looking at those options.

<HEAD>West Germany Announces Aid Plan for East German Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Wednesday it was
creating a $70 billion fund to help rebuild East Germany's
shattered economy. The opposition said the move raised new
questions about unification's real costs.
   Details of the plan were outlined at a news conference by West
Germany's finance minister, who said costs of the program would be
borne by the federal government and the 11 West German states.
   Meanwhile, the West German government said a treaty to formally
merge the two German economies on July 2 will be signed at a
ceremony in Bonn on Friday. The announcement was made by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein.
   The two Germanys have been negotiating the economic merger since
March. Talks have centered on replacing East Germany's nearly
worthless currency with West Germany's mighty mark and creating a
strong social security net for East Germans.
   Negotiations on the economic merger had been complicated by East
German fears of widespread joblessness as the country's economy
undergoes a total overhaul, but the two sides were able to reach
agreement this week as planned.
   In another development, a West German goverment official said
Kohl and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere would speak
soon about possible dates for an all-German vote.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader for Kohl's Christian
Democrats, said Kohl and de Maiziere ``will be having ... contacts
in which an election date will be in the forefront.''
   Kohl's government, which supports speedy unification, is
pressing for united German elections as early as Dec. 2, when West
German national elections are slated. De Maiziere has not said what
he thinks of holding all-German elections this year.
   But East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel, a leader of the
opposition Social Democratic party, said ``an early date for joint
elections is not in our interest.''
   Like the East German party, West Germany's Social Democrats
favor slower unfication and oppose united elections this year.
   A leading official in Kohl's coalition, Michaela Geiger, gave
another reason for holding early elections: uncertainty over how
the troubles of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could affect
German unity.
   ``We don't know exactly how things will be continuing in the
Soviet Union,'' she said. ``It's therefore very important to
quickly complete unification, after we have the approval of all
participants.''
   West Germany's finance minister, Theo Waigel, said the agreement
to create a fund to aid the East German economy was reached
Wednesday by the governors of West Germany's 11 states and federal
officials.
   He said $57.5 billion will be raised on the domestic capital
market, with the federal government providing 50 percent and the 11
states sharing the other half. Another $12.1 billion will come from
federal budget savings, he said.
   But East Germany must begin quickly turning over state-owned
property to private owners to cover further costs, the finance
minister said.
   The opposition Social Democrats said the move supported their
charges that Kohl has not been forthcoming about what the merger of
the two Germanys will cost.
   Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the Social Democrats' parliamentary
leader, said the fund will cover only part of unification costs.
Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social Democrats' national chairman,
repeated a demand that the Kohl government detail the merger's
price.
   Also Wednesday, it was announced in East Berlin that East
Germany's central bank president, Horst Kaminsky, was retiring
immediately for ``health reasons.'' Kaminsky had headed the central
bank since 1974.
   East Germany's central bank will lose most of its power when the
two German economies are merged because its West German
counterpart, the Bundesbank, will control monetary policy of both
Germanys.

<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved a bill that
would expand the Head Start pre-school program fivefold over the
next four years to include all eligible children.
   The legislation, passed 404-14 and sent to the Senate, would
authorize up to $2.4 billion for Head Start in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, $1 billion more than the current year's spending
level.
   The program would grow to $7.7 billion in fiscal 1994.
   The actual dollars allocated each year could be kept short of
those figures because of budgetary pressures, but sponsors of the
bill vowed to push for full funding.
   ``Congress has made a tremendous investment in our children that
will yield an invaluable return for our nation,'' said Rep. Dal
Kildee, D-Mich., chief sponsor of the bill.
   Head Start was begun 25 years ago to help children from
poverty-stricken families enter school as well prepared as those
from better situations. Nearly half a million children are in the
program, but that's only 20 percent of those eligible.
   The bill approved Wednesday also authorizes several other
ongoing social programs throught 1994.
   They include the follow through program to carry some Head Start
children through the third grade and Community Services Block
Grants to local agencies for their job programs, emergency food and
shelter and other services.

<HEAD>FDA Seeks Ban of Some Ingredients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday it wants to ban 258 ingredients in over-the-counter
remedies used to treat conditions ranging from acne to warts.
   The ingredients have not been proved effective, the FDA said.
The agency and an industry official said many of the ingredients no
longer are used.
   The FDA announced a similar proposal earlier this month to ban
more than 100 unproven ingredients used in non-prescription diet or
appetite suppression drug products.
   The two proposals are the latest developments in the FDA's
massive review of all ingredients in an estimated 300,000
non-prescription products. The review began in 1972 and is expected
to be completed in 1993.
   John Walden of the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers said he
found ``nothing earthshattering'' on the list of ingredients to be
banned and agreed with the FDA that companies have had ample time
to show the ingredients were effective.
   ``Most of them have been taken out'' of the preparations in
which they had been used, he said.
   The ingredients that would be banned were or are used in drugs
treating a variety of conditions, including allergies, boils, cold
symptoms, dandruff, ingrown toenails, pain, psoriasis, thumbsucking
and swimmer's ear.
   The FDA said it would issue a final rule after a 60-day comment
period.

<HEAD>Government Lacks Adequate Regulation of Chemicals, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is failing to adequately
recognize or regulate chemicals that lead to Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases and other neurological disorders, a
congressional report says.
   A study by the Office of Technology Assessment said federal
agencies must give more attention to nervous system disorders
caused in part by environmental toxins and should do the research
necessary for new rule-making.
   ``Millions of American workers are exposed to neurotoxic
substances in the workplace, but illness stemming from these
exposures often goes undetected and untreated,'' the study said.
   Because of inadequate research, it said, little is known about
the potentially adverse effects of thousands of these chemicals on
the nervous system.
   The report called for Congress to consider increasing spending
on research into the effects of toxic chemicals on the nervous
system, to provide additional funds for toxicity testing and
monitoring of groups of people exposed to such chemicals, and to
better coordinate a federal regulatory program for neurotoxic
substances.
   ``Chronic neurotoxicity presents a health risk every bit as
large and as tragic as cancer, yet almost nothing is being done
about it,'' Sen. Albert Gore said in releasing the report. ``Our
regulatory system is virtually blind to this risk.''
   Gore, chairman of a Senate technology subcommittee, told a
Capitol news conference that the Office of Management and Budget
denied a plea by the Environmental Protection Agency for an
additional $1.5 million to conduct research on the problem. ``I
would hope we could end this foot-dragging,'' the Tennessee
Democrat added.
   The report said more than 65,000 toxic substances and chemicals
are in use and many can damage the nervous system, causing or
contributing to such disorders as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.
   The neurotoxic substances range from industrial chemicals and
drugs to food additives and ingredients in cosmetics.

<HEAD>Bush Undecided on Favored Trade Status for China</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush said Wednesday he was still
grappling with whether to remove preferential trade conditions from
China to protest its repression of democracy advocates.
   ``I don't want to send a signal that we're happy with their
(China's) human rights record,'' he said.
   But Bush also said trade concessions are important to the
economy of Hong Kong, which funnels 70 percent of China's trade
with the United States, and for the Chinese people.
   ``It isn't an easy call,'' he said at a news conference.
   Bush has until June 3, the first anniversary of the crackdown in
which Chinese demonstrators were killed near Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, to decide whether to seek extension of the
most-favored-nation status for Chinese exports to the United States.
   It is ``one of the most important foreign policy decisions our
government will make this year, and certainly the most important
with respect to China,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia.
   Winston Lord, U.S. ambassador to Beijing from 1985 until last
year, told two congressional subcommittees that Bush should extend
the trade provisions for another year.
   Lord, who broke with the Bush administration over its policy on
China, also said the concessions should be accompanied by strong
gestures of support for democracy and human rights within China.
   Lord said it should be made clear that if conditions do not
improve inside China, its leaders ``cannot expect MFN to be
preserved a year from now.''

   Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii moved to the Senate
from the House Wednesday, promising in his new post to continue the
legislative agenda of his predecessor.
   ``I pledge to fill this high office with dignity and honor,''
the Democrat said after being sworn in by Senate President Pro
Tempore Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Akaka said the opportunity ``fills
me with enormous pride and profound humility.''
   He promised to carry on the legislative agenda of his
predecessor, Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga, also a Democrat, who died
April 15.
   Akaka, 63, who has served 13 years in the House, was appointed
by Gov. John D. Waihee III to hold Matsunaga's seat until the
November election. Akaka and Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki are
expected to compete for the remainder of the six-year term, which
ends in January 1995.
   Akaka was introduced by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, as the
first native Hawaiian and the first native American to serve in the
Senate. Akaka ``epitomizes the highest virtues of what we proudly
call the aloha spirit of Hawaii,'' Inouye said.

   Sixty police investigators have been sent to a
southern town to help hunt for the vandals who desecrated graves
and mutilated a corpse at a Jewish cemetery, the government
announced Wednesday.
   Officials also condemned an assault on a high school teacher who
had talked about the desecration with her class.
   Another case of desecration of a Jewish cemetery was reported
Wednesday. This one occurred in Italy.
   Legislators in France's National Assembly observed a minute of
silence to mark the wave of racist and anti-Semitic incidents that
began with last week's desecration in Carpentras, France.
   ``Racism and anti-Semitism are not opinions,'' said Assembly
President Laurent Fabius. ``They are crimes.''
   Premier Michel Rocard told the assembly that 60 investigators
had been sent to Carpentras to reinforce those already working on
the case. Police nationwide were working doggedly to solve the
racist and anti-Semitic crimes, he said.
   In the southwestern city of Perigueux, three law students and a
teen-ager appeared in court Wednesday after they were arrested on
charges of painting neo-Nazi slogans on a synagogue and a war
memorial.
   Incidents of racial or political vandalism have occurred almost
daily since the Carpentras desecration was discovered May 10.
   In the latest incident, a fire of suspicious origin gutted the
offices of a Communist Party newspaper in Bergerac late Tuesday or
early Wednesday.
   On Monday, two masked men beat up Christiane Guiard, a high
school teacher, after she devoted a class to racism in response to
the cemetery desecration.
   Ms. Guiard, a history and geography teacher at the Emile Zola
College of Royan, near Bordeaux, said she was getting out of her
bathtub when the intruders entered her home and beat her.
   The attack followed several threats in anonymous telephone
calls, she said from her hospital bed.
   The men ``told me `Dirty Jew, dirty Arab, you were warned,'''
said Mrs. Guiard, 41. She suffered several cuts and was receiving
treatment at a Royan hospital. ``The reason? I see one. It's
racism,'' she said.
   Moslem immigrants also have been the target of racist attacks in
France.
   Extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who frequently
utters anti-Semitic remarks, says he favors expelling France's 3.4
million Moslem immigrants.
   Ms. Guiard is neither Jewish nor Arab.
   She said that in a class Saturday, she discussed France's
anti-racism law of 1972 with her 15- and 16-year-old students.
   ``I noted to the students that since this law, freedom of
expression still exists, of course, but that racism in any form is
not an opinion but a crime,'' Ms. Guiard said.
   The governing Socialist Party said the attack marked the first
time since World War II that a teacher was assaulted because she
``loyally carried our her mission.''
   In Naples, Italy, officials disclosed that vandals dugs up tombs
and overturned 20 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery. The desecration
occurred about 15 days ago but was made public only this week by
leaders of the 200-member Jewish community in the city.

   Sammy Davis Jr. died of throat
cancer Wednesday, loosing the last battle of a rough-and-tumble
life as a song-and dance man that made him an entertainment
institution. He was 64.
   ``He died at 5:59 a.m. here at home, peacefully in his sleep''
with his wife, Altovise, and three of his four children present,
business mangager Shirley Rhodes told reporters outside his house.
   Davis was diagnosed with throat cancer eight months ago, and his
health deteriorated steadily after he went home from the hospital
March 13.
   ``I guess they need a good show up in heaven, that's all I can
say. He was a wonderful person,'' said Joey Bishop, who with Davis,
Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin formed the core of Hollywood's
fun-loving, high-living but hard-working ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s.
   ``Sammy was a little prince who loved everything life had to
offer,'' said Shirley Maclaine, another ``rat-packer.''
   ``I am numb with pain. He was my inspiration. He's the performer
we all strived to live up to. I never saw anyone give so much,''
said Liza Minnelli, who toured with Davis and Sinatra last year.
   Davis, whose hit songs included ``The Candy Man'' and ``I've
Gotta Be Me,'' was born in New York's Harlem section and began
dancing at age 1{.
   Over the years, Davis joked that he was the nation's only
``black, one-eyed, Jewish entertainer.'' He converted to Judaism
while recovering from an automobile accident that cost him his left
eye and nearly took his life.
   An actor, singer, dancer and impressionist, the exuberant Davis
lived life hard and fast. His gold chains, heavy rings and gaudy
bracelets were as much a part of his personality as the chain of
cigarettes he smoked.
   His work on stage, screen and television displayed a versatility
matched by few. Though scorned by some as merely a gilded Las Vegas
drone, and criticized by others as being a token of the ``Rat
Pack,'' Davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainer's
entertainer.
   ``He gave his heart and soul to every performance and he was a
true American institution. There will never be another one like
Sammy,'' said former President Reagan.
   ``He'll never be replaced and my sympathies go to his wife and
children,'' said Milton Berle, who had known Davis for more than 60
years.
   ``People just couldn't get enough of Sammy. He could do it all _
sing, dance, comedy,'' Bob Hope said.
   In 1958's ``Anna Lucasta,'' one of the few all-black dramas to
emerge from Hollywood before the 1970s, Davis played a raunchy
sailor opposite a lusty Eartha Kitt. He was slick and engaging as
Sportin' Life in Otto Preminger's ``Porgy and Bess'' (1959). In
1968's ``Salt and Pepper,'' he and Lawford portrayed London
nightclub owners who solve a murder.
   Davis appeared in more than 20 movies and starred in two
Broadway productions _ ``Mr. Wonderful'' and ``Golden Boy.'' He
received a Tony nomination for best actor in a musical for ``Golden
Boy'' in 1965 but lost to Zero Mostel, who won for ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
   Davis also performed on numerous television specials and series,
including ``General Electric Theater,'' ``Mod Squad,'' ``Lawman,''
``All in the Family'' and ``The Cosby Show.''
   He attracted a diverse audience, and was considered a big enough
draw to have his own TV series: ``The Sammy Davis Jr. Show'' in
1966, and ``Sammy and Company'' in 1975-77.
   His lively, upbeat manner belied a very difficult life. His
career was scarred by vicious racial bigotry. There were endless
taunts, and at one time, he couldn't gamble or rent a room in some
of the Las Vegas hotels at which he played. His second marriage, to
Swedish actress Mai Britt, was scorned by some.
   He also faced drug and alcohol abuse and crippling tax problems.
   He wrote two autobiographies, ``Yes, I Can'' in 1965, and ``Why
Me?'' in 1989. In the latter, he described his all-night partying,
endless drug use and womanizing.
   While Davis was rarely taken seriously by critics, his energetic
routine _ combining comedy, music, dance and personal reflection _
drew steady audiences for decades. He also flirted with politics,
performing at benefits for Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and
Richard Nixon.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer, Little Mo. The movie captures
Davis' last dance performance on film, a brief tap routine made
poignant because he had undergone painful hip surgery in 1985 and
received an artificial hip in 1988.

   Born Dec. 8, 1925, to Sammy Davis, a dancer, and chorus girl
Elvera Sanchez Davis, he started hoofing at age 1{.
   When he was 4, his father and ``adopted uncle'' Will Mastin
passed him off as a 44-year-old midget.
   ``I had a rubber cigar in my mouth and they would treat me like
an adult,'' Davis once recalled. ``That was the only way we could
get around the child labor laws.''
   Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, the legendary tap dancer, was so
impressed by the fledgling dancer that he offered to teach Davis.
   After touring with the Will Mastin Trio along the tawdry
vaudeville circuit for three years, Davis appeared in his first
film, ``Rufus Jones for President,'' in which the 7-year-old sang
``I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You.'' A touching scene
in the movie shows him falling asleep in the lap of a young, pretty
and svelte Ethel Waters.
   Devoting all of his time to his act, Davis had no formal
education. By the time he was 15, the trio had crisscrossed the
country 23 times.
   ``From the time I can remember, I've been around greasepaint,''
Davis once said. ``While other kids my age were playing with
marbles and toys, I knew only about the backstage dressing rooms.''
   When he was 18, Davis joined the Army, where he produced camp
shows, some of which he wrote and directed himself.
   After the war, he rejoined his father and uncle. But Davis was
now the headliner.
   In 1946, he recorded ``The Way You Look Tonight'' and was named
the most outstanding new personality by the now-defunct jazz
magazine Metronome.
   Following a triumphant first engagement at Ciro's in Hollywood
in 1951, he was signed by Decca Records. His first Broadway show,
``Mr. Wonderful,'' ran for 383 performances starting in 1955.
   He followed ``Mr. Wonderful'' with ``Golden Boy,'' a musical
based on the Clifford Odets drama. It ran for 569 performances in
1964. He returned in 1978 to the New York stage for a limited
engagement at Lincoln Center in a revival of ``Stop the World, I
Want to Get Off.''
   By the 1960s, he'd established himself as one of the most
popular and richly compensated entertainers in the world.
   He married dancer Loray White in 1958; they divorced a year
later. He wed Miss Britt in 1961, and they had a daughter and
adopted two sons. They were divorced in 1968. He married Altovise
Gore, a dancer in his nightclub act, in 1970.
   His hit songs included ``Something's Gotta Give'' (1955), ``I've
Gotta Be Me'' (1969) and ``The Candy Man'' (1972). Other recordings
were ``Love Me or Leave Me'' and ``That Old Black Magic'' (1955),
``Hey There'' (1954) and ``What Kind of Fool Am I'' (1962).
   His film credits included ``The Benny Goodman Story,'' ``Anna
Lucasta,'' ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``Oceans 11'' ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
   Among the more unusual stages in Davis' life was a stint as the
manager of boxer Sonny Liston in the 1960s. In the 1980s, he
merchandised his own brand of food items, including barbecue sauce,
chili and mustard.
   In addition to his wife, Davis is survived by his daughter,
Tracey; sons, Mark, Jeff and Manny; his mother, Elvera; sister,
Ramona; and two grandchildren.
   Funeral services were set for 11 a.m. Friday at Forest Lawn
Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills with burial following at
Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale.

<HEAD>Nebraska Democrats Face Recount; Abortion Focus in Pa. Governor
Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Two Nebraska Democrats who finished just 94 votes apart faced
the prospect Wednesday of a time-consuming recount to determine who
earns the right to run against Republican Gov. Kay Orr.
   In Pennsylvania, Auditor General Barbara Hafer won a GOP primary
to challenge Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, but she said a strong
showing by her anti-abortion opponent ``sends a message to the
pro-choice people that we are not organized.''
   With complete but unofficial returns from Nebraska's seven-man
Democratic primary Tuesday, Bill Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob
Kerrey, led with 44,281 votes, or 27 percent. Ben Nelson, an Omaha
lawyer and former state insurance director, had 44,187 or 27
percent.
   Hoppner said he was beginning immediately to campaign for
November's general election. ``Obviously, it's better to be 94
votes ahead than 94 votes behind,'' he said. ``You only need one
more to win.''
   Said Nelson: ``I'm not going to operate as though I lost. It's
more like operating in a bit of limbo.'' He said his campaign might
try to shorten what officials said could be a 27-day process for a
recount.
   Canvassing boards in each county will meet Thursday to begin
counting remaining absentee ballots, said Ralph Englert, deputy
secretary of state.
   State law requires the recount if the runner-up appears to lose
by a margin equal to 1 percent or less of the votes received by the
leader.
   The Board of State Canvassers will meet June 11 to determine if
there will be an automatic recount. If so, it would begin June 13,
Englert said.
   Mrs. Orr, the nation's first Republican woman elected governor
of any state, won her own primary, defeating Omaha businessman Mort
Sullivan by a 69-31 percent margin. But Democrats said that only
showed her vulnerability.
   ``Let me point out that her opponent _ hardly a household name _
got 30 percent of the vote. That's hardly a show a of strength,''
Kerrey said.
   Former Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle, who led the Democratic field much
of the night, finished third with 41,154 votes or 25 percent,
followed by Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris with 31,361 or 19 percent.
   In Pennsylvania, Hafer, who is pro-choice and had the backing of
the state GOP, defeated Marguerite Luksik of Johnstown in a race
that was closer than expected. Casey, who like Luksik is strongly
opposed to abortion, easily dispatched a pro-choice Democratic
opponent.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Casey had 630,892 votes,
or 77 percent, to 184,656 or 23 percent, for lawyer Philip S. Berg.
Hafer had 319,670 votes, or 54 percent, to Luksik's 268,563 votes
or 46 percent.
   ``This should send a message to the people who want me to be the
next governor of Pennsylvania that it is incumbent on us to ...
understand that choice is a very, very, very big issue,'' Hafer
said.
   Here are highlights of other results in Tuesday's voting:
   PENNSYLVANIA _ Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark S. Singel, like Casey an
opponent of abortion, survived a challenge on the issue from former
state party chairman Edward Mezvinsky.
   NEBRASKA _ Two-term Democratic Sen. James Exon had no primary
opposition, and former Republican Rep. Hal Daub won the GOP
nomination, piling up 92 percent of the vote against Omaha landlord
Otis Glebe.
   OREGON _ Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer won the Republican
primary for governor, gaining 79 percent of the vote in a seven-way
race. He will compete in November against Democratic Secretary of
State Barbara Roberts.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield defeated environmentalist Randy Prince with
78 percent of the vote in to win the Republican nomination for a
fifth term. His November challenger, businessman Harry Lonsdale,
took 63 percent of the vote in a six-way race.
   Residents of the college town of Eugene soundly defeated a
measure to toughen an ordinance banning the local manufacture of
nuclear weapons and their components.

<HEAD>Group Wants Stricter Building Codes To Help Avoid Child Scaldings</HEAD>

   Household plumbing fixtures should come with
safety devices that shut off when water gets hot enough to burn a
small child, a children's advocacy group said Wednesday.
   Such safety valves would help prevent scaldings that send 100
children a day to hospital emergency rooms nationwide, the National
Safe Kids Campaign said.
   This year, ``37,000 children, under the age of 14, will be
injured by a scald burn severely enough to receive emergency
medical treatment,'' said former Surgeon General C. Everette Koop.
   Most, he said, will be injured in their homes by tap water, hot
beverages or food ``in less than the time it takes you to answer
the telephone in an adjoining room.''
   The majority of the incidents will occur while children are
unattended, said Koop, who is chairman of the Safe Kids campaign.
   ``It happens all the time. Every day 100 children are taken to
emergency rooms with scald burns in this country,'' he said.
   ``Just three seconds in tap water over 140 degrees Fahrenheit
can cause a third-degree burn requiring hospitalization and skin
grafts,'' Koop added. The group said water temperatures as high as
180 degrees have been recorded in urban apartment buildings.
   The coalition, a nonprofit organization founded in 1988 to help
prevent childhood injuries, said Wednesday it would work to amend
local plumbing and construction codes to include stricter
regulations for fixtures that control water temperatures and
regulate water pressure.
   Ann Parsons and Kim Snyder, nurses in the burn unit at
Children's National Medical Center in Washington, praised the Safe
Kids initiative, saying 50 percent of the burns they treat are from
scaldings.
   ``What gives us a little red mark can give a small child a
first- or second-degree burn,'' Parsons said.
   Safe Kids also will help provide the saftey valves for faucets,
bathtubs and showers in low-income homes with children under five.
The average cost for retrofitting fixtures in older homes is $13
per sink, $17 per shower and $40 per bathtub, members of the group
said. However, Safe Kids will provide the installations for $5 each
to low-income residents.
   The coalition has launched a pilot project to install the
devices in homes in seven cities.

   The navy fired anti-submarine grenades
at a suspected intruder vessel off the Swedish coast, the military
said Wednesday.
   Navy vessels and helicopters on exercise in the Baltic picked up
sonar indications of an unidentified vessel Tuesday night outside
Sandhamn, east of Stockholm, Swedish radio reported.
   There was no evidence any vessel was hit by the grenades. The
navy was searching for traces of the intruder in water 230 to 300
feet deep.
   It was the first time since February that the navy fired live
ammunition at a suspected intruder.
   Swedish waters have been violated for at least a decade by
foreign vessels. None has been caught since a Soviet submarine
grounded on a rock in 1981.
   Last year the military reported a drop in the number of
suspected intrusions.

   West Germans traveling to East Germany now
only need to show an identity card at the border, East German
Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said Wednesday.
   Although many border controls between the two German states have
fallen since the opening of the Berlin Wall in November, West
Germans were still required to show their passports when traveling
to East Germany.
   The new rules were to take effect at midnight Wednesday.
   The latest move was expected at the end of June, but Diestel
told reporters the passport requirement was being lifted to enable
West Germans easier access to West Berlin for Saturday's German
soccer cup final.

<HEAD>Polhill to Undergo Cancer Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Freed American hostage Robert Polhill has a
cancerous growth around his vocal cords that will require surgeons
to remove his voice box, his physicians said Wednesday.
   Such radical surgery, scheduled for Thursday, might have been
avoided if the tumor had been diagnosed sooner, doctors said.
   The tumor ``is quite old, probably at least a year,'' Col. Russ
Zajtchuk, deputy commander of clinical services at Walter Reed
Medical Center, said at a news conference.
   ``If it had been discovered earlier, he probably wouldn't have
to lose his voice box, provided he had the right radiation
therapy,'' Zajtchuk said.
   There is no evidence the cancer has spread, but Polhill's
treatment will include radiation therapy, Zajtchuk said.
   Polhill, 55, was held captive by Shiite Moslems in Lebanon for
39 months before being released April 22.
   ``We are going to overcome this ordeal. We are survivors, and we
are definitely going to survive this ordeal,'' Ferial Polhill said
at the news conference, which her husband did not attend.
   Polhill has told his doctors he was visited by physicians eight
or 10 times during his captivity.
   ``I'm pretty sure they didn't examine his throat,'' Zajtchuk
said.
   ``He's a smoker and this condition is related to smoking,''
Zajtchuk said, adding that Polhill told him his captors had kept
him in cigarettes.
   ``The growth is involving both vocal cords. One vocal cord, the
left, is paralyzed,'' Zajtchuk said. ``The tumor also extends below
the vocal cords, so it is quite an extensive lesion.''
   Polhill's weak, raspy voice prompted early discovery of the
tumor. A full diagnosis was put off until Polhill, a diabetic and
who was 25 pounds underweight when he was released, gained enough
stamina to undergo the general anesthesia necessary for a biopsy.
   Polhill was told after the biopsy last week that the growth was
cancerous, and agreed to surgery. Public disclosure was postponed
to give Polhill time to tell members of his family, Zajtchuk said.
   Mrs. Polhill said her husband's spirits were ``very high, very
positive, strong.'' Polhill's mother, Ruth, nodded agreement.
   Zajtchuk said Polhill had begun working with a speech therapist
to explore various methods for voice communication once the larynx
is removed.
   One common method involves the use of an electronic device that
emulates the voice box. Another technique involves swallowing air
and regurgitating it in a way that forms words.
   A third possibility, one not favored for radiation patients,
requires a tracheotomy _ the insertion of a breathing tube in the
throat.
   ``His mental status is remarkable,'' Zajtchuk said. ``Imagine a
fellow being locked up for 3{ years. And then he comes to Walter
Reed, and he virtually gets locked up again. And then he can't
communicate, because he's going to lose his voice box.''
   Polhill is expected to spend about two weeks in the hospital
after the surgery, then will undergo radiation treatments.
   Polhill has made several excursions out of the hospital since he
returned to the United States. He visited President Bush at the
White House and attended a dinner to celebrate his 10th wedding
anniversary.
   He also has visited Frank Reed, a fellow hostage who was
released this month. Reed has been recuperating at a hospital at
nearby Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

<HEAD>Governor Calls For Development Aid for Mississippi Delta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said Wednesday the
federal government could do more for the poor people of the lower
Mississippi Delta through development programs than with the
welfare payments now sent.
   ``If we were a foreign country we might get more development
aid,'' Clinton, chairman of the Lower Mississippi Delta Commission,
told a House hearing.
   He said millions of dollars in welfare money now going to the
region keep the 8 million residents there just above starvation.
   ``Wouldn't development be better, so they can start sending
money back to you?'' Clinton, a Democrat, said at a joint meeting
of subcommittees with jurisdiction over programs sought by the
commission.
   The commission released a report this week based on an 18-month
study of the problems in the 219 counties of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and Kentucky
that comprise the Delta.
   ``Anyone who reads this report can see we ask more of ourselves
than the federal government,'' Clinton said of 400 recommendations
for federal, state and local action.
   He said Congress should first decide which of the
recommendations can be carried out immediately by the Bush
administration.
   The suggestions should then be organized by cost.
   He could not estimate the total cost of the suggestions in the
186-page report, but said improvements to roads and highways
probably would be the most expensive.
   Clinton said the states would pool money to set up an office
that would lobby for the recommendations after the
congressionally-created commission goes out of business Sept. 30.
   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss. whose constituents are among the poorest
in the nation, and Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., have created a working
group of 24 House members who say they also will be advocates for
the report.
   ``It's my first priority,'' said Espy. ``I think we'll see some
material action this year on these projects.''
   In his testimony, Clinton called for reauthorization of the
National Health Service Corps Act at 1985 levels. He said Congress
should provide special provisions for placement of physicians in
the Delta and revise Medicaid-Medicare reimbursement formulas to
help rural hospitals.
   ``We also ask states to do the same,'' he said. He also
suggested immediate action to improve education, agriculture,
housing and community development, utilities, highways and private
enterprise.
   ``We ask you to immediately agree on a bill that increases the
number of subsidized day care positions for low-income families
which will help welfare mothers go to work and not take a financial
loss,'' Clinton said.
   ``Agriculture has been and will continue to be a major economic
resource for the Delta,'' said Clinton. ``We recommend that a Delta
agriculture technology transfer program be developed by colleges
and universities with the support of federal and state governments
to disseminate information and training to farmers on the latest
agriculture technology.''
   He also asked Congress to support a national biotechnology
cooperative project in the region to generate private investment
and educational opportunities and contribute research.

   Shifting patterns on the television screen when
youngsters play video games can, on rare occasions, trigger
epileptic seizures, a doctor warns.
   The doctor described one such case as that of a 13-year-old girl
who played a Nintendo game steadily for three hours.
   Seizures caused by flickering light are called photosensitive
epilepsy. It is uncommon and occurs in about 2 percent to 3 percent
of people with epilepsy. In these people, ordinary television,
disco strobe lights or sunlight seen flashing through leaves while
riding in a car may touch off a seizure.
   While video games also may trigger seizures in people who
already have epilepsy, they do not cause the underlying disorder.
   The latest example was reported by Dr. Edward J. Hart of the
Franciscan Children's Hospital in Boston. His letter, headlined
``Nintendo Epilepsy,'' was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   He noted that a similar episode, dubbed ``Dark Warrior
epilepsy,'' was described in the British Medical Journal eight
years ago.
   In a statement, Nintendo of America said the company ``is
sympathetic to those who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy.'' It
urged victims to consult their doctors.
   In the same issue of the journal, Dr. Richard Brasington of the
Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin described another potential hazard
of too much game playing _ Nintendinitis.
   He described a 35-year-old woman who woke up with a sore thumb
the day after she played non-stop Nintendo for five hours. The pain
went away after she took a pain killer and avoided video games for
a few days.
   To this, Nintendo replied: ``We believe the amount of game play
necessary to induce such symptoms is extraordinary and consequently
we believe these instances occur quite infrequently.''

<HEAD>Finland Would Be New Transit Point For Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli and Finnish authorities are
working out a plan to allow Soviet Jews immigrating to Israel to
use a small airport on the Finnish-Soviet border as a transit
point, official sources said Wednesday.
   The pact would make Finland the fourth major route for Jews
emigrating from the Soviet Union. The others are Hungary, Romania
and Poland.
   Under the plan, to take effect early in June, convoys of Finnish
buses will begin shuttling emigrants from the Soviet Union to
Lappeenranta, a Finnish town of 54,000 people about 12 miles from
the Soviet border, the sources said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Israeli-chartered aircraft will fly the Soviets directly to Tel
Aviv within hours of their arrival in Finland, said the sources,
speaking by telephone from Finland.
   A report that Lappeenranta would become an air bridge for Soviet
Jews also appeared Wednesday in Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's
leading daily newspaper. It quoted unnamed Israeli sources.
   Finnish radio reported Wednesday that President Mauno Koivisto
had rebuffed a call from Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat to abandon the project.
   In response to a letter from the PLO chief, Koivisto wrote that
Finland's decision to allow the transit of Jews was based on
humanitarian principles and the freedom of movement, the radio said.
   But Koivisto also told Arafat that Finland understood that the
Israeli government would not settle the new immigrants in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   The sources said plans call for the transit of several hundred
emigrants every month in the first stage, and possibly thousands
monthly later on.
   Israel said about 10,500 Soviet Jews arrived in April, a monthly
record since the Soviet Union opened the gates last year to most
Jews who want to leave.
   The Finns announced in March they had agreed to let Soviet Jews
pass through their territory, but the negotiations for mass transit
were held in strict secrecy in the face of Arab opposition.
   Reports from Israel on the subject were quashed by military
censorship.
   The sources claimed Finland received explicit threats of
terrorist reprisals if the transit plan proceeds. They did not say
by whom or to whom the threats were made.
   ``Should there be some sort of terrorist threat ... a clear
concrete threat, we have had plans in readiness for some time to
deal with it,'' said police Inspector Teuvo Ikonen on Finnish radio.
   Lappeenranta airport cannot handle large aircraft requiring long
runways but the town was reportedly chosen because its proximity to
the Soviet border reduces security risks.

<HEAD>Group Says Health Care Reform Would Give Consumers More Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private research group on Wednesday proposed
restructuring the nation's health care system to give consumers
more control over the prices they pay and quality of care they
receive.
   John Goodman, president of the Dallas-based National Center for
Policy Analysis, said the plan differed from most of the dozens of
health care reform proposals because it would rely on the
free-enterprise system.
   It is designed to appeal largely to small businesses and the
self-employed, which comprise a large part of the estimated 31
million Americans without health insurance.
   The plan would abolish state regulations that require insurance
companies to cover certain costs. This would allow insurers to
offer no-frills plans, which cost less because they pay only for
catastrophic illness, he said. Also, deductibles on all insurance
plans would be raised to $1,000.
   The center's plan would give individuals a tax credit for a
portion of their health insurance premiums, he said. This would
give people who are not offered health insurance by an employer tax
advantages now available only for employer-provided health
insurance.
   People would be encouraged to put money saved by these tax
credits and other personal funds into their own ``Medisave''
account. They would use this money to pay the smaller,
non-catastrophic medical bills, for which they could negotiate
prices with providers, Goodman said.
   The proposal was outlined in a report prepared by researchers
from 40 research organizations and universities, but Goodman said
not all of the researchers agreed with every recommendation. He
said he drafted the framework for the proposal.

<HEAD>De Klerk Turns Down Invitation to Visit Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel invited South African President F.W. de
Klerk to visit the Jewish state on his way back from Washington
next month, but South Africa turned down the offer, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   De Klerk, who became president in September, is on a nine-nation
European tour and is to meet with President Bush in Washington on
June 18.
   ``We told the South African government that we are willing to
invite de Klerk to visit Israel following his visit to the United
States,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Barukh Binah. ``The South
Africans expressed their appreciation, but said the timetable would
not permit a visit at the time.
   ``They said de Klerk would come at a later time.''
   He said no date has been scheduled.
   Binah said the Israeli government had not discussed lifting the
sanctions imposed on South Africa in September 1987 in protest of
the nation's apartheid policies. They include a ban on new
investments and imports of oil and Kruegerrand gold coins, and a
reduction in sports contacts.
   The sanctions were seen as symbolic, and Israeli officials said
at the time they would not seriously hurt the annual $240 million
in trade between the two countries.
   Unconfirmed foreign and Israeli reports have said the nations
cooperated closely in producing cruise missiles and fighter
aircraft. Israel also has sold fast patrol boats,
surface-to-surface missiles and rifles to South Africa, according
to these reports.
   De Klerk was invited to visit the European nations after he
began pushing for reform of South Africa's apartheid system. He has
released black South African leader Nelson Mandela and some other
anti-apartheid activists and legalized opposition groups, including
the African National Congress.
   De Klerk met Mandela this month and reached broad agreement with
the ANC to work to end political violence and prepare the way for
blacks to share power in the government.
   South Africa has 5 million whites, 28 million blacks, about 3
million people of mixed race and 850,000 Asians and Indians.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites
control the economy and maintain separate residential districts and
schools.

   Bachelor sports columnist John Rohde
abandoned the sporting world in his column Wednesday, and narrowed
his audience to one special person in hopes of gaining a wife.
   It worked.
   Rohde prefaced his offbeat marriage proposal with a warning to
those perusing his column in The Daily Oklahoman that if they
wanted to read about sports, ``you won't find it here today.''
   ``I promise to return to our usual subject tomorrow, but today
I'm going to try to change someone's life. My own.
   ``It's with trembling fingers and a racing heart that I type the
following: `Debbie Burchart, will you marry me?'''
   ``She said `Yes,''' according to a taped message left on his
telephone answering machine.
   Rohde timed his newsprint proposal with the first anniversary of
the day he met Ms. Burchart. He conceded that the novel approach
could backfire if she refused.
   ``I'm not sure how people will perceive this column, Deb. But as
you've come to know by now, that's pretty much the case every time
I occupy this space,'' he wrote. ``Proposing to you in this forum
is either somewhat courageous or incredibly stupid. Either way, my
sincerity is genuine.''
   He suggested Aug. 1 as the wedding day, then wrote, ``Please,
don't respond with a letter to the editor.''

   For Sale: A pair of historic gold
mining towns featuring frontier saloons, general stores, livery
stables, clapboard hotels and a dance hall.
   Owner Ford Bovey says Virginia City and adjacent Nevada City
about 70 miles northwest of Yellowstone National Park could become
true ghost towns if he doesn't find a buyer for the seasonal
tourist attractions.
   Bovey wants the National Park Service to buy the historic
properties run by his Bovey Restorations Inc., his attorney, David
Hoffman, said Monday.
   Once a sprawling frontier town of more than 10,000 residents,
Virginia City had a population of 190 as counted in the 1980
census. It remains the Madison County seat.
   Bovey said he needs to sell because most of the buildings don't
generate any revenue, and seasonal attractions like a dance-hall
show can't raise enough to cover costs.
   Private investors have expressed interest in buying some or all
of the property, but talks with them are on hold pending
discussions with the park service, the attorney said.
   Meanwhile, Virginia City and Nevada City will operate as usual
this season, said manager Bruce McCalolum.

   President Bush said Wednesday that he won't
yield to pressure from Democrats to ``go first'' in proposing tax
and spending cuts needed to bring the federal budget deficit under
control.
   Nor will he make a prime-time television address to the nation
on budget problems in the absence of a deal with Congress, Bush
told a news conference.
   ``I don't want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the
markets,'' Bush said, adding that he would make such an address
``at the appropriate time.''
   Some congressional Democrats criticized Bush on Wednesday, a day
after the first budget summit talks, for refusing to go directly to
the public with the economic bad news that prompted him to call a
summit on the budget deficit.
   ``If we're in such bad straits ... the American people ought to
hear it, and let's get on with fixing the crisis,'' said Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a member of the House Budget Committee.
   Democrats kept the pressure on Bush to give the deficit a
higher-profile stance, despite his arguments against the prime-time
television appearance.
   ``He should be speaking out,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.
``If he's so concerned about this foreign aid going to Nicaragua
and Panama, he should be as concerned about these budget deficits.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee and a budget summit negotiator, said Bush must ``start
now to sell the dimensions of the problem and go before the people
to talk about the seriousness of it.''
   ``It should be a major address to the American people,'' Bentsen
said. ``The longer he waits, the more difficult it will be.''
   Bush said he was optimistic after the first round of budget
negotiations, saying the session ``involved a fair degree of trust.
I don't think people think I'm trying to blindside them in the
Congress.''
   The president offered no apologies for his decision not to
present an opening proposal on deficit-cutting steps to get the
budget talks moving. His refusal to list specifics helped fuel
Democratic suspicions that he was trying to blame them for tax
increases.
   ``The Democrats did come down, some of them, saying, `Well you
should go first,' '' Bush said. ``I said, `Wait a minute. Who
appropriates all the money?, Who's got the obligation under the
Constitution to raise the revenues (taxes)?'
   ``So let's not talk about who's going first. We've got a
problem. We have a national problem,'' Bush added.
   Bush said he was hopeful that he and Democrats had gotten over
``the hurdle of suspicion.''
   A second bargaining session, which the president will not
attended, will be held Thursday on Capitol Hill.
   Bush said he intended to ``keep my share of the bargain'' by not
signaling ``what we might do or might not do, what my bottom line,
what my opening wedge is.''
   ``Because once I do that, you'll have 435 people in the House do
it and 100 in the Senate,'' he added.
   Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room, Bush was
asked if he considers the current budget situation a test of his
leadership on a major domestic problem. He responded: ``I expect
so.''
   As he has before, Bush sidestepped the issue of new taxes,
saying he did not want to comment on any issues that might be up
for negotiation.
   Asked if a tax existed that would not be a drag on the economy,
Bush declared: ``You're trying to get me to do that which just one
second ago I wouldn't do.''
   However, on the prospect of reaching a budget compromise that
can win the support of the adminstration and a majority of both
House and Senate, the president said: ``After some initial
posturing around, we'll make some headway.''
   Bush said he hopes to see interest rates fall, but had no
guarantee from the Federal Reserve that the central bank would act
to force rates down.
   The adminstration has blamed the widening deficit gap on rising
interest rates, along with lower-than-expected revenues and a
higher-than expected pricetag on the savings and loan bailout.
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman has said the deficit could
near $200 billion next year unless action is taken.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush planned
no television speech because the public already knows the problem.
   ``We talk about the problems all the time,'' so a televised
address on the budget is not needed, Fitzwater said. ``We talk
about the deficit. Everybody knows what the deficit is.''

<HEAD>Stevens Joins O'Connor as High Court Millionaire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice John Paul Stevens is the Supreme
Court's newest millionaire, financial statements released Wednesday
show.
   He joins Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as the only millionaires
among the court's nine members.
   The financial statements for 1989 also show that Justice Antonin
Scalia was paid the most on the lecture circuit, receiving $37,000
for 14 appearances.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist earned $19,658 last year in
honoraria and payments for summer teaching assignments at the
University of Arizona, the University of Michigan and Louisiana
State University.
   And Justice Anthony M. Kennedy reported the most notable gift _
$375 worth of custom-tailored shirts.
   Rehnquist's annual salary as chief justice is $124,000. The
eight associate justices are paid $118,600 a year.
   Six of the court's members reported they were worth more by the
end of 1989 than they were a year earlier. The three others said
their net worth remained unchanged.
   Stevens listed assets worth between $1.3 million and $2.02
million for 1989.
   He actually achieved millionaire status in 1988, but that fact
was not generally known until now. The financial forms Stevens
initially filed for 1988 omitted substantial holdings _ a 200-acre
farm in Webster County, Iowa, and three properties in Illinois.
   Those properties include a 12-unit apartment house in Alsip, Ill.
   Stevens confirmed Wednesday that he filed an amended financial
statement for 1988 after initially listing assets worth between
$183,500 and $405,000.
   The justices, along with other top government officials, are
required to file the annual statements under the Ethics in
Government Act.
   The law requires only broad ranges of estimated worth for
assets, and exempts any asset worth less than $1,000, personal
property items and the primary residence.
   Here are the listed 1989 assets of the court's members:
   _O'Connor, $1.6 million to $3.06 million or more; up from $1.3
to $3.8 million for 1988. O'Connor's estimated wealth does not
include her portion of the estate of her late mother, Ada Mae Day,
who died last year.
   _Stevens, $1.13 million to $2 million; up from the $183,500 to
$405,000 initially reported for 1988.
   _Rehnquist, $226,000 to $615,000, up from $186,000 to $480,000.
   _Scalia, $315,000 to $400,000, unchanged.

<HEAD>GAO Says Government Can't Assure Homeowners on Radon Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeowners can't be assured that all radon
tests are reliable despite government attempts to verify their
accuracy, congressional investigators said Wednesday.
   The Environmental Protection Agency annually monitors test
procedures and the accuracy of radon test kits from hundreds of
testing companies and allows manufacturers to promote the fact that
their kits are EPA approved.
   However, officials of the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, told a House Science, Space and
Technology subcommittee that the EPA review does not necessarily
assure homeowners that the test information is accurate.
   ``The voluntary nature of the (government) program allows firms
to market devices that fail the program or that have not been
tested,'' said Richard Hembra of the GAO.
   GAO investiations, he said, have shown that some companies sell
test kits that did not meet government standards or kits that had
not been reviewed by the EPA. In a few cases, companies submitted
one type of device for review and put another type on the market,
he said.
   Various public interest groups also have complained that the EPA
monitoring program for radon test kits allows companies to know
beforehand when one of their test samples is being examined so
special precautions can be taken.
   The EPA estimates that as many as 20,000 lung-cancer deaths are
attributed to indoor radon contamination, making radon the second
greatest cause of lung cancer after smoking.
   If radon levels in a home are found to be greater than 4
picocuries per liter of air, the EPA said levels should be reduced.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas emitted from the
earth. The concern arises when the gas becomes trapped in closed
homes and accumulates to unhealthy levels. A radon problem often
can be resolved by increasing ventilation, authorities say.
   A rapidly growing radon-testing industry has emerged in recent
years, although the EPA does not require testing for radon.
   Hembra cited a GAO study late last year that indicated many of
the test kits don't meet federal standards and said additional
reviews continue to raise questions about test accuracy.
   ``Even with the increased number of firms demonstrating
proficiency in measuring radon, EPA and the public still cannot be
assured that all companies meet proficiency standards or that
measurement results are accurate on a day-to-day basis,'' Hembra
said.
   Because EPA review is voluntary, Hembra some testing companies
can continue to market kits that have not been reviewed by the EPA
or failed EPA scrutiny. The agency also does not require companies
to implement quality assurance programs.
   Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy adminstrator, said the agency
was expanding so-called ``blind tests'' during which companies are
not aware that one of their kits is under agency scrutiny.
   He said the EPA also is requiring that testing companies in the
review program develop quality assurance programs, but acknowledged
participation remains voluntary.

<HEAD>Customs: `High-Tech Bandits' Schemed to Ship Computer to Bulgaria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY WINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two computer dealers turned into ``high-tech
bandits'' in a scheme to illegally ship a supercomputer to
Bulgaria, the U.S. Customs Service charged Wednesday.
   An ETA 10 main-frame computer made by Control Data Corp. was
awaiting shipment to Marseilles, France, when it was seized Tuesday
in two shipping containers at the Port of Charleston, S.C., said
Miami Customs chief William Rosenblatt.
   ``What we have here basically is two high-tech entrepreneurs in
the businesss who because of their greed and avarice became
high-tech bandits,'' he said. ``Technically, this computer could
run a whole city.''
   One man was arrested in Charleston and the other when he arrived
in Miami, allegedly to collect $1 million for the computer.
   The 9-ton computer is banned for sale to East bloc countries
because of its potential military applications, customs officials
said.
   ``If in fact the computer had gone to an Eastern bloc country as
they thought it was going to, the damage to the United States in my
opinion would have been immeasurable,'' Rosenblatt said at a news
conference.
   Only seven ETA 10s have been exported legally, and customs
spokesman Michael Sheehan said the agency believes the seized
supercomputer was the most sophisticated anyone has ever tried to
ship illegally.
   The investigation began in January with a tip from an informant
who had been approached by the two men, who said they were
interested in selling an ETA 10, customs said.
   Under the direction of customs agents in Miami, the informant
told the men he wasn't interested in the computer himself but had
contacts in the East bloc who were.
   The illegal nature of the enterprise ``was constantly noted by
the Customs source,'' who cautioned that substantial documentation
and Commerce Department approval were required for the sale, said a
Customs Service news release.
   But the men said they knew the requirements and would produce
false documents, agents said.
   Robert Wheeler, 44, president of American Technology Trading
Group Ltd. in San Francisco, was arrested in Charleston and later
released on $100,000 bond.
   Nick Spiliotis, 44, president of C.I.D. Corp. of Long Beach,
Calif., was taken into custody in Miami and was being held pending
an appearance before a U.S. Magistrate.
   Both were charged with violating the Export Administration Act,
which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a
$100,000 fine.
   The ETA 10 line of supercomputers was discontinued by
Minneapolis-based Control Data in April 1989, said Control Data
spokesman Dave Lindsey.
   Buyers included universities, petroleum companies and government
research laboratories and weather centers.
   The seized supercomputer has 513 megabytes of internal memory
and 1.4 gigabytes of external memory.

<HEAD>Bush Says Soviet Action on Baltics `Puts Tension' on Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday the Soviet
effort to block independence drives in the Baltic republics
``certainly puts some tension'' on his summit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev but would not stand in the way of nuclear arms talks.
   Bush held out hope the superpowers can agree soon to cut
long-range nuclear weapons when he meets with Gorbachev in two
weeks.
   Appearing to choose his words with great care, Bush said, ``I
wouldn't say that it appears unlikely'' that he and Gorbachev would
be able to sign a treaty framework on nuclear arms during their
four days of talks.
   ``I would not predict that these matters cannot be resolved in
time for the summit,'' he said.
   U.S. officials have complained that Moscow has backtracked in
arms talks, clouding prospects for a deal.
   Bush, at a wide-ranging news conference, said he was awaiting
word from Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is in Moscow
trying to break the stalemate.
   The president met with reporters one day after the opening of
budget talks with Congress, and he expressed optimism about
reaching an agreement to cut the burgeoning deficit.
   While rejecting Democratic calls that he go first with a
comprehensive package of his own, Bush said he had ``no tricks in
the bag.'' He declined to say what tax increases, if any, he would
accept.
   Spurning Democrats' suggestions that he make a televised address
on the economy's problems, Bush said he wanted to wait until he had
a bipartisan solution.
   The president said he did not want to ``do something that might
inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten (stock) markets. ...
Right now the markets are reasonably optimistic and there are
reasons to be optimistic about the economy.''
   Opening the news conference, Bush made an ``urgent appeal'' to
Congress to approve $300 million in economic aid for Nicaragua and
$500 million for Panama.
   He urged the House and Senate to cancel a planned Memorial Day
recess next week, if necessary, to enact the legislation. ``I think
the American people are frustrated by the inability of the Congress
to do business in a prompt and orderly fashion,'' he said.
   However, Bush said he would veto the aid bill if Congress
included a provision involving federal money for abortions in the
District of Columbia.
   Bush said he was unable to provide a $40 million temporary loan
requested by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro because ``the
Nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment. And our hands are
tied.''
   On other points, Bush said:
   _He has not decided whether to grant an extension of
most-favored-nation trade benefits for China. Bush said there are
strong arguments not to terminate the benefits but that he did not
want to signal that he was happy with Beijing's record on human
rights.
   _He will announce a decision in ``days and not weeks'' on
whether to permit offshore oil drilling near the coasts of Florida
and California. While citing environmental concerns, Bush said he
did not want the United States to become more dependent on foreign
oil.
   _The United States would reluctantly give up its two military
bases in the Philippines if the government of Corazon Aquino
demands too high a price. ``There are other ways to skin this
cat,'' Bush said, referring to alternate basing proposals.
   Moscow's efforts against independence moves taken by Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia have put a deep strain on U.S.-Soviet relations.
A senior administration official, commenting after Bush's news
conference, said the issue was ``the most difficult problem in our
relationship.''
   Bush said, ``I'd say that it has certainly put some tension on
the summit.
   ``We want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you call
it _ discussions between Gorbachev and the Lithuanians get going,''
he said. ``And then I'd like to see the release of that economic
pressure on Lithuania.''
   ``And that would clear the air,'' Bush said.
   Still, the president made clear that the dispute would not stand
in the way of his meeting with Gorbachev.
   ``We have a broad agenda of items that we must go forward on,''
Bush said. ``We have negotiated with the Soviets when all of
Eastern Europe was in captivity and when we had Cold War times.''
   He said he wanted to see the Baltic states gain their
independence but that ``I feel it's important from our standpoint,
the important standpoint of Eastern European countries and Western
European allies, and indeed the whole world, that we have these
discussions with Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Turning to bills being considered in Congress, Bush expressed
confidence about reaching agreement on civil rights legislation
that would reverse recent Supreme Court rulings making it more
difficult to prove employer discrimination and easier to challenge
the legality of affirmative action plans.
   However, he said he had ``real problems'' with legislation that
would require companies to provide leave time for new parents. ``I
think it boils down to the concept of whether you are in favor of
mandated benefits or now,'' Bush said.
   Asked about the six remaining American hostages in Lebanon, Bush
said, ``I have seen no reason to be encouraged that the process
(toward their release) is under way.''

   Special payments to Vietnam veterans who were
exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange are not subject to federal
income tax, the Internal Revenue Service ruled Wednesday.
   An estimated 60,000 U.S. military personnel and their survivors
are eligible for payments from a fund created in 1984 as a result
of a class-action lawsuit against several manufacturers of the
chemical. Payments are restricted to those who served in Vietnam
between 1961 and 1972.
   The administrator of the fund asked the IRS for a ruling on
whether the payments or interest earned on investment of the fund's
assets were taxable income. The IRS said the money is not taxable
because it is considered compensation for personal injuries.
   The fund administrator gave the IRS permission to make the
private ruling public, said IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek.
   Many veterans say they suffered lasting injury to their health
by being exposed to Agent Orange, which U.S. forces used to
defoliate Vietnamese jungles.

<TEXT>
   There has been much argument over the past two
decades about the exact merits of ``Sesame Street,'' but none over
the crucial role Jim Henson's Muppets played in the television
program's phenomenal popularity.
   It was unclear Wednesday what affect Henson's death would have
on the program, which is produced by the Children's Television
Workshop.
   ``There's no way of telling,'' said Mary Sue Holland, a
spokeswoman for CTW. ``We honestly don't know.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 foreign nations. It has been estimated that about
half of all American children between 3 and 5 watch the show.
   Bob McGrath, an actor on the program, returned a telephone call
to The Associated Press but said he and other cast members had been
asked by Henson's family not to speak with the news media. He
referred questions to CTW.
   ``In the beginning (Henson) certainly was the key figure in
developing characters and their style, but over 20 years they've
grown and matured, so there's a team there now,'' said Dr. Milton
Chin, director of instructional television for KQED in San
Francisco and a former researcher for CTW.
   ``There's a lot of talent all around (at Henson Productions),
but they'll be missing the creator,'' he added.
   The Muppets first regular, widespread exposure came when
``Sesame Street'' went on the air in 1969. The characters indulge
in slapstick, introduce video clips and live performances and
participate in skits. They have sung with Ray Charles and played
tennis with Martina Navratilova. Kathleen Turner has read them
bedtime stories, and Tracy Ullman has told them jokes.
   The show's Muppets have been created, assembled and dressed in
Henson's office-factory in Manhattan. He once denied that they were
created with any human personality in mind: ``With Big Bird we knew
we wanted to do a large, a great big character. He should represent
a child, so he can make the kinds of mistakes that kids make, and
talk about it and be out front about that. So we wanted this large,
kooky creature.''
   Henson's contributions to the show twice won him Emmys and made
stars of these characters:
   _Big Bird, the yellow 6-footer who still manages to see and
enjoy life like a small fry.
   _Oscar the Grouch, a beast of indeterminate species who lives in
a garbage can and complains about the (high) quality of life on
Sesame Street.
   _Bert and Ernie, humanoid companions who are attached,
respectively, to a paper clip collection and a yellow rubber duckie.
   _The Cookie Monster, a shaggy blue beast who was named for his
chief weakness.
   _Kermit the Frog, who appears as a live, if bumbling, television
correspondent at the scene of the such fairy tales as The Princess
and the Pea and Cinderella.
   _Guy Smiley, ``America's favorite game show host.''
   _The Count, an Eastern European of noble birth who is obsessed
with numbers.
   Henson was the voice and puppeteer for Kermit, Ernie and Guy
Smiley, and it was hard to see how, at least in this capacity, he
could be replaced.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make his first visit to
Canada as Soviet president on May 29-30 en route to his summit in
Washington with President Bush.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who invited Gorbachev to visit
Canada when the two men met in Moscow last year, made the
announcement Tuesday in Ottawa.
   No agenda has been released though Gorbachev, who visited Canada
as part of a Soviet trade delegation in 1983, is expected to spend
the night in Ottawa before heading to Washington, where Bush and
Gorbachev are to meet May 30-June 3.
   The Baltic states' drive for independence from Moscow will be a
major topic for discussion while Gorbachev is in Ottawa, Mulroney
said.
   ``It's a follow-up to our discussions in Moscow last November,''
Mulroney said. ``It has been rolled very quickly to the front
burner and it's something on which we would want to have a lengthy
discussion.''
   Mulroney told reporters outside the House of Commons that
Canada, like the United States, has never recognized the forced
annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   In a reference to Soviet pressure on the Baltic states to
renounce their declarations of independence, Mulroney also recalled
he and External Affairs Minister Joe Clark were given assurances
last year that there would be no crackdown.
   ``I suppose you could argue over what a crackdown is, but there
have been some changes in attitudes, obviously.''

<HEAD>GATT Agrees to Moscow's Bid for Observer Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade agreed Wednesday to grant the Soviet Union observer status in
the international trade group, a spokesman said.
   David Woods said the group unanimously approved Moscow's
application and Soviet officials later attended a meeting of GATT's
top decision-making body.
   U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Rufus Yerxa told the meeting a
Soviet presence would increase understanding of centrally planned
economies and help countries instituting reforms.
   ``It is the sincere hope of my government that ... the U.S.S.R.
will eventually embrace a market-based price and distribution
system which could be compatible with GATT norms,'' Yerxa said.
   But he said discussion of Soviet membership in the 96-nation
group was premature.
   A text of his speech to the closed meeting was made available to
journalists.
   Soviet representatives will be allowed to attend regular
meetings of GATT's decision-making council, which discusses trade
disputes and other issues affecting global commerce. They will be
able to speak in debates but will have no voting rights.
   Washington opposed observer status for the Soviets last year,
saying the status should not go into effect until after the
so-called Uruguay Round of talks on liberalizing trade practices,
to be held in December.
   Yerxa said the Bush administration agreed to drop this condition
because nearly all the members of GATT supported giving the Soviets
observer status earlier.
   It is too late, however, for the Soviets to participate in the
Uruguay Round. The talks began in 1986 and their goal is to reach
comprehensive agreements for free trade in areas such as
agriculture and textiles.
   More than 30 countries have observer status with GATT, including
China, which is seeking full membership.
   The members of the trade forum account for more than four-fifths
of global commerce.
   Also Wednesday, the ruling body of GATT accepted the findings of
an arbitration panel that European Community taxes on Japanese
electronic components assembled in the EC are illegal.
   But European Community trade representative Tran Van-Thinh told
the meeting there were no immediate plans to change EC legislation
on so-called ``screwdriver'' plants that allegedly merely assemble
components imported from a third country.
   The EC, Canada and the United States are pressing for tougher
measures to prevent countries from dumping products on a foreign
market for a lower price than on the home market.

<HEAD>Farm Couple's Suicide Pact Follows Floods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There was the drought of '88, torrential
rains in '89, an early freeze and then this spring's deluge
threatening their cotton and wheat farm. Finally, a suicide pact.
   James McMullen shot his wife, Billie, to death, then turned the
gun on himself Sunday night after a weekend of heavy rain.
   Both were 58 years old.
   Mrs. McMullen wrote and signed the note they left, detailing
their wishes for funeral services but offering no insight into why
they decided on suicide, said Capt. Marvin Melton of the DeSoto
Parish Sheriff's Office.
   The timing has led some friends to speculate that the flooding
in their northwestern Louisiana community of Evelyn was a factor.
Friends said McMullen, who suffered a heart attack last year, had
become quieter and more withdrawn recently and that he and his wife
seemed closer.
   But Steve Schutz hadn't noticed any difference in their behavior.
   ``I guess I'm one of the few who really hadn't seen a change in
him,'' Schutz said in a telephone interview. Schutz is Red River
Parish's county agent, a local representative of the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
   ``I was with him Friday evening, looking at a wheat crop that
had failed _ which was an insured crop. He had good coverage on the
crop. It was lost to cold, wet weather this spring,'' Schutz said.
   ``He just needed to go through the insurance procedures, and
then I assumed he was going to go ahead and plant soybeans there,''
he said. ``But I'm the only one I know of who had that impression.
Everyone else I've talked to says that when they think back, they
noticed a change.''
   McMullen's home, a restored plantation house, sits on a knoll
overlooking the farm outside of Evelyn _ about 1,500 acres of
table-flat land bordered by Bayou Pierre, a backwater of the Red
River.
   The Red is out of its banks, sweeping over 200 square miles of
Louisiana farmland, and Bayou Pierre had no place to go except over
McMullen's land and other nearby farms some 240 miles northwest of
New Orleans.
   The McMullens are survived by a son. Another son died about
20-years ago in a farming accident when he was 5.
   Buddy Johnson, also a farmer, knew McMullen well and said he
understands why his friend took his life.
   ``Farming is not just a business. It's a lifestyle. It's your
whole life,'' Johnson said. ``If you've got high hopes and all of
that is suddenly taken away from you, what have you got to live
for.''
   It costs about $300 an acre to produce a cotton crop, and
McMullen already had reseeded his land once this spring after rains
buried his work in mud.
   Schutz said he believed McMullen was back in decent financial
shape after a couple of really rough years. At least three
generations of McMullen's family were farmers and McMullen farmed
in northeastern Louisiana before moving to Evelyn more than 20
years ago.
   ``I think he had turned the corner. He maybe wasn't very far
from the corner, but it appeared to me that he had made it,'' he
said. ``To me, that he was able to get financing on such a large
operation indicated that the banks had faith in him. A lot of
people couldn't get financing.''
   As Schutz and McMullen wound up their visit on Friday, rain
began to fall. Eight inches of rain fell on Saturday, and flood
water roared down the Red River from Arkansas and Texas. On Sunday,
about 36 hours after their visit, McMullen and his wife were dead.
   ``My pastor called me at home after church and told me about it.
I was shocked,'' Schutz said.

   Energy had a face. It was slack-jawed with a
broken nose and crooked smile. And versatility had a name. It was
Sammy Davis Jr.
   He was a spunky little treasure of raw talent whose battle with
cancer had been as fierce as the battles he fought throughout his
60-year career.
   Davis, who measured a mere 5-foot-6 and weighed not much more
than a jockey, died Wednesday at 64. He was the last working
vestige of old-time vaudeville as well as entertainment's
Renaissance man. Davis did it all _ and then some: singer, dancer,
impressionist, actor, comic.
   ``I love working,'' he once said. ``I know I'll have a lot of
time to rest and read my scrapbooks. You never know when the public
gets tired of you _ they're fickle. You never know when it can
happen. The average life of a performer is four, five years. For me
it's been unusual.''
   But despite the money, the glamour, the accolades, the fame, the
celebrity, it was also rough _ real rough for a one-eyed, black
Jewish guy.
   From the time he put on his first pair of tap shoes as a baby in
Harlem to his death, Sammy Davis Jr. always seemed to be proving
something, always seemed to be looking for acceptance and trying to
win over his detractors.
   He entered show business at a time when black people were called
colored, and danced bugged-eyed with white paint on his face
because white producers wanted it that way. And though he was
everyone's little darling, he lived in segregated hotels and ate in
segregated restaurants.
   He danced his way into the Army during World War II, and
responded to prejudice with his fists. His nose was broken in a
fight with a white soldier. Others painted him white, to remind him
that he wasn't, and gave him a beer bottle filled with urine.
   He performed at army bases around the country while in Special
Services, giving an extra surge of energy the minute he sensed
anyone in the audience who hated blacks. He said in his
autobiography, ``Yes, I Can,'' that he had to ``neutralize them''
and force them to acknowledge him.
   Years later, associates said that one reason Davis continued to
perform with such gusto and go that extra mile was an attempt to
make the world love him.
   After the war, his high-energy flash-dancing and impressions of
Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart made his popularity
soar. It was a time when blacks were called Negroes, and Negroes
weren't supposed to mimic whites. But Davis did.
   Negroes also weren't supposed to date whites. But Davis did,
despite death threats during his friendship with actress Kim Novak
and stares and taunts during his marriage to Swedish actress Mai
Britt.
   After a racial demonstration outside a London theater where he
was performing in 1960, he spoke to reporters with tears in his
eyes. ``This is little London, England, not the nigger-hating
South,'' he said. ``I cannot get over it. I really cannot.''
   But he kept on dancing, and he kept on singing and acting and
entertaining. With verve and strength. With conviction.
   When he was 30, he told The Associated Press: ``Talent is
something you either have or don't have. But the next most
important thing is honesty. You have to play fair with your
audience. ... You have to give them everything that's in you
everytime you go out there, or they'll spot you for a phony. And
once audiences think you're a phony, you can't last long.''
   Davis dived into his work with a vengeance. In 1966, while he
performed nightly at the Majestic Theater on Broadway in ``Golden
Boy,'' he spent his days filming the movie ``A Man Called Adam,''
and his weekends shooting his TV series, ``The Sammy Davis Jr.
Show.''
   The pace eventually led to exhaustion and he had to take a rest.
But not for long. ``Sammy can never quite relax,'' a friend once
said. ``He has to be doing something all the time.''
   When black became beautiful, Davis became one of the gang. The
Rat Pack, that bon vivant group of high-flying celebrities. He was
chastised by other blacks for being a token.
   No matter. These were his buddies, and he had known Sinatra
since meeting him in the early '40s while touring with his father
and uncle as ``The Will Mastin Trio.'' For Davis, being a
Rat-Packer was a heady experience.
   During the past decade, Davis' popularity diminished, a victim
of his problems with alcohol and hard living and of an apathetic
audience that had moved on to other things.
   Still, little flickers of his energy remained. He tapped his
heart out and taught the very talented Gregory Hines a thing or two
in the 1989 movie ``Tap'' _ this despite an artificial hip Davis
had received in 1988.
   ``After a while, you can't keep playing Don Quixote,'' Davis
said in a 1986 interview. ``You can't keep fighting windmills.''

<TEXT>
   Tracey Ullman, the versatile comedian who
helped launch Fox Broadcasting Co. and won the fledgling network
its first Emmy, announced Wednesday she was quitting four years
into a five-year contract.
   ``I have decided not to go on with `The Tracey Ullman Show'
after four seasons in which I was constantly challenged and happily
tortured by a unique group of people,'' Miss Ullman said in a
statement released by Fox.
   ``I thank Fox for letting somebody no one ever heard of do a
show on a network that didn't exist.''
   Miss Ullman's departure comes two days after her friend and
executive producer James L. Brooks announced he was leaving Fox to
sign a deal with Columbia Pictures Television.
   Miss Ullman's personal style of comedy mixed a closetfull of
personalities with offbeat humor and earned the alternative network
four Emmys and twenty nominations.
   Although critically acclaimed, the Saturday night show featuring
comedic and musical sketches never did well in the ratings, often
finishing last in the Nielsens race. The final show has been
completed and is scheduled for broadcast on May 26.
   ``We are grateful to every one of the extraordinary group who so
painstakingly built each segment of the 81 episodes of `The Tracey
Ullman Show,''' Fox Chairman Barry Diller said in a prepared
statement.
   Miss Ullman leaves Fox four years into a five-year contract. ``I
think it was probably mutually agreed upon,'' said Fox spokeswoman
Antonia Coffman. Reruns of ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' will be shown
exclusively on the Lifetime cable channel beginning in September,
she said.
   Despite poor ratings the program had built a cult following of
dedicated viewers.
   The British comedian's seemingly endless array of characters and
accents helped make her one of the best-known new performers in
this country.
   Miss Ullman costars with Kevin Kline in the recently released
theatrical film ``I Love You to Death'' and is currently in New
York rehearsing for a summer run of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' in
Central Park with Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.

<HEAD>Oregon Lawmaker Calls for End to Draft Registration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Draft registration is a relic of the Cold War
and should end, an Oregon congressman said Wednesday.
   ``You can even buy pieces of the Berlin Wall in discount stores.
Meanwhile, the Selective Service System continues as if nothing
happened. That doesn't make sense,'' Rep. Peter DeFazio said in an
interview.
   DeFazio, a Democrat, introduced a House bill that would
eliminate the president's authority to mandate registration
effective Nov. 30. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., is expected to
introduce a similiar measure in the Senate.
   The rationale for registering 18-year-old men has been
eliminated by the wave of democracy spreading through the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe, DeFazio said.
   ``The military today is not worried about how to recruit,
mobilize or train people,'' he said. ``They are worried about how
to make a reduction in force that will be necessary in the coming
years.''
   DeFazio ending the draft would save between $10 million and $16
million annually.
   ``Our national security is best served by a well-trained,
well-equipped and highly motivated reserve force, not outdated
symbols that have little, if anything, to do with military
preparedness,'' he said.

   ``City of Angels'' was named best musical of the
1989-90 theater season Wednesday by the Drama Desk, while ``The
Piano Lesson'' by August Wilson was chosen as best play.
   ``City of Angels,'' a satire of Hollywood and 1940s detective
novels, received eight awards, more than any other show. It was
followed by ``Grand Hotel,'' another big musical, which received
five awards, including two for Tommy Tune as oustanding
director-musical and choreographer.
   Nathan Lane won the best actor award for his portrait of an
obsessive fan of Maria Callas in ``The Lisbon Traviata.'' Named
best actress was Geraldine James, who played Portia in the Dustin
Hoffmann revival of ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   Tyne Daly, who plays Mama Rose in the revival of ``Gypsy,'' was
named best actress in a musical while James Naughton won the
actor-musical category as a hard-boiled Los Angeles private eye.
   Frank Galati was named best director of a play for his work on
``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel.
   The Drama Desk, an association of New York drama critics and
reporters, will present the awards on May 20.

<HEAD>NBC's Troubled `Today' Show Goes Back to the Future with Joe
Garagiola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It startled many when NBC's troubled ``Today''
show hired a guy named Joe. But Joe Garagiola, the show's past and
future co-host, laughed Wednesday as he recalled repeating the
wisdom of Yogi Berra to surprised pal.
   ``I said, `Hey, Yogi's right. It's deja vu all over again,' ''
said the 64-year-old ex-catcher, sportscaster and ``Today''
colleague of Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters, and later, Frank
McGee, from 1969 to 1973.
   Garagiola and another new hire, former CBS morning news anchor
Faith Daniels, will make their debut on ``Today'' on June 4 in
Washington _ at the same time NBC affiliates are holding their
annual meeting there.
   The affiliates, who have not been pleased with the state of
``Today,'' may be cheered by the return of the popular Garagiola.
He will guest-host on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
   It's NBC's version of ``Back to the Future'' at a time when
``Today'' is trying to halt a deepening drop in ratings with talk
of restoring the ``family'' atmosphere of yesteryear, a new set,
and a familiar face _ his.
   ``Everybody knows Joe and what he brings to the table,'' said
``Today'' executive producer Tom Capra. ``And that's intelligence,
fun, irreverence and probably laughter. And all those things are
things we need.''
   The show's slide to second behind ABC's ``Good Morning America''
began in January with NBC's much-criticized switch of co-host
Deborah Norville for the well-liked Jane Pauley, a 13-year
``Today'' veteran.
   It also was in January that Garagiola and other former ``Today''
hosts were reunited on the show. Afterwards, Gumbel, a friend,
urged him to return to the show.
   ``Bryant said, `We have a lot of fun, you ought to come back at
least once a month,''' he recalled. However, he said, he was
enjoying semi-retirement and watching his grandchildren grow. His
reply: ``What are you, crazy?''
   About a month later, another ``Today'' friend, movie critic Gene
Shalit, joined him at a benefit banquet and urged him to return to
``Today,'' perhaps once a month, Garagiola said by phone from his
home in Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``I said, `Well, you be my agent, okay?' ''
   Last month, he said, Gumbel called, said changes were afoot,
some people were being added, and that ``I want to put your name in
the hopper.''
   The three-day-a-week deal was agreed on Monday, said Garagiola,
who left NBC Sports in 1988 after 27 years and has been doing
play-by-play coverage of California Angels' home games for cable
TV's SportsChannel.
   Although better known as a sportscaster, ``some of my happiest
days have been on `Today,' '' he said. His interviews on the show
weren't just about sports, and were with a wide variety of guests.
   ``It's nice to know people believe that you can say something
besides curveball or back-door slider,'' he said.
   If his return helps ``Today,'' that won't be too soon for NBC.
   Last week in New York, the nation's largest TV market, the show
even fell to fourth place locally, coming in behind Fox-owned
WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York.''

   A tornado that pulverized a path across
the city smashed cars, blew away roofs and drove wooden planks from
shredded rafters 2 and 3 feet deep into yards.
   ``I thought our house was bad, but when you look at this part of
the neighborhood, I don't even know how anybody could survive
this,'' Kathy Ackerman said Wednesday as she looked over the damage
the tornado caused late Tuesday. `You have to see it to believe
it.''
   One person was killed and eight were injured in Stillwater and
more than 200 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged. A
tornado also struck near Foyil in northeastern Oklahoma, injuring
eight people and damaging 10 homes.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon promised he would seek federal disaster aid
for the area of mostly brick homes.
   ``It came through those back yards and touched down on top of
our house,'' said Jan Van Pelt. ``We're still digging, but at least
we still have each other and our baby and our puppy.''
   Mrs. Van Pelt, standing in her roofless home, said her husband
saw the funnel cloud on the horizon and ordered the family into a
bathroom. It was one of the few rooms left standing Wednesday.
   ```It's hard to believe,'' she said. ``I don't think the full
impact has hit me. I haven't sat down and cried yet.''
   Police and a National Guard unit cordoned off one square mile of
the most heavily damaged homes and businesses in Stillwater. Only
residents, authorities and the media were allowed into the areas.
   Police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet said some looting had been reported.
   ``A lot of people have come up and told us their apartments or
houses were stripped,'' Mittelstet said. ``We have no idea yet on
the extent of it. We have the streets blocked off so it mostly was
what they could carry.''
   Next door to Mrs. Van Pelt's home, Trey McCauley picked through
the wreckage of his residence. McCauley, a student at Oklahoma
State, said he had heard the sirens and fled to shelters on campus.
   When he returned, he couldn't believe what he found.
   ``I heard it was bad. I didn't know it was this bad,'' he said.
   Troopers of insurance adjusters began arriving late Wednesday
morning to survey damage.
   Clem Santine, who heads the disaster team for State Farm
Insurance, said damage would be difficult to assess.
   ``A lot of these houses are total losses,'' he said. ``They're
probably looking at bulldozing and starting over.''
   Santine estimated the cost of most of the homes at between
$45,000 and $60,000.
   Some of the worst damage was caused by debris from neighboring
homes.
   Dennis Davis' home was smashed by a large section of a roof that
blew onto his property from across the street.
   ``I felt my house shimmy. I could hear the rain and the wind.
Then it sounded like an explosion,'' he said.
   Firefighters say it could be two days before all electricity is
restored in the neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   Imported fruits and vegetables are likely to
be contaminated by illegal pesticides, according to data from the
Food and Drug Administration released Wednesday.
   Overall, 5 percent of the imported produce examined by FDA
inspectors during the last two years contained residue from
pesticides that are not allowed to be sold to farmers in the United
States.
   The contamination rate may be even higher, because FDA does not
screen for all the possible pesticides that are used in foreign
countries, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   ``Although FDA is responsible for inspecting almost all imported
food, it only samples a minuscule 1 percent to 2 percent of the
food entering this country,'' said Leahy. ``The rest is simply
waived through at the wharf.''
   Leahy requested the FDA data. He is sponsor of a bill that would
ban U.S. chemical companies from selling pesticides abroad that are
outlawed for health reasons here. The bill is scheduled for a
committee vote Friday.
   Leahy called the new data ``the most compelling reason for
stopping export of dangerous pesticides.''
   About 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables eaten by Americans
come from other countries. Data on domestically grown produce
showed little or no pesticides residues.
   ``Buying food should not be a gamble,'' Leahy said. ``Consumers
should not have to choose between off-season cantaloupes and cancer
every time they buy imported fruit at the supermarket checkout
line.''
   Here is the extent by percentage to which 12 tested fruits and
vegetables were found to be contaminated, based on inspections
between Oct. 1, 1988 and April 13, 1990: peas, 10.3; eggplant 9.4;
cabbage 8.9; pears, 8; peppers, 7.4; squash, 4.5; carrots, 2.3;
broccoli, 1.7; tangerines, 7.1; okra, 7.2; blackberries, 8.9;
papayas, 4.1.

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of congressmen introduced
legislation Wednesday to correct what they called Medigap insurance
industry practices that range from deceitful to fraudulent.
   The group said insurance companies were pressuring millions of
elderly people into wasting meager resources by duplicating health
coverage.
   Many senior citizens are ``frightened to death of the extreme
high costs'' of health care and are ``terribly vulnerable to being
exploited,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``They end up
spending unconscionable sums of money on policies they don't need.
It's time to put a stop to that.''
   Medigap insurance covers health care costs not included under
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
Riegle said part of the problem was sharp increases in Medigap
insurance rates since Congress repealed the catastrophic health
insurance program last year.
   The proposed legislation drew quick opposition from the health
insurance industry, which said the lawmakers were exaggerating the
problem of duplicative Medigap coverage.
   ``If just one person buys insurance they do not need, that's one
too many. But we do not believe it's a widespread problem,'' said
Don White, spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of
America.
   He said an industry survey last year found that 15 percent of
senior citizens with supplemental Medicare policies had more than
one private insurance policy in addition to Medicare.

   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said Wednesday he
was ``deeply offended'' by an article by New York's Cardinal John
O'Connor condemning a Jewish settlement in the Christian Quarter of
Jerusalem's Old City.
   ``There is no question that the action of the Jewish settlers
was political but I feel more and more strongly that politics is
equally the motive behind a good deal of the reaction,'' Kollek
wrote in a letter to O'Connor.
   ``Beyond the one-sidedness of your article,'' the mayor said,
``I am personally deeply offended.''
   O'Connor spoke with Kollek about the move and on Thursday wrote
in the weekly archdiocesan newspaper Catholic New York: ``I trust
his sincerity when he tells me he does not believe that the
incident in Jerusalem is part of a massive land grab or other
anti-Christian policy planned by the government.''
   But, he added, ``I have no way of knowing whether his opinion is
right or wrong.''
   In a letter, released by Kollek's office Wednesday, the mayor
said he assured O'Connor the incident was ``not in any way part of
an anti-Christian policy of the Israeli government.''
   Kollek, who strongly opposed the settlement, said he believed
Christian leaders have overreacted because of a ``conspiracy
syndrome'' caused by pressure from Moslem and Palestinian activists.
   ``What surprised me,'' he wrote, ``is that you chose to
subscribe to this conspiracy syndrome which will surely not help in
our efforts to reinstate the understanding and harmony that have
characterized relations between Jews and Christians in Jerusalem
throughout the years.''
   On April 11, about 150 Jewish settlers moved into an Old City
complex owned by the Greek Orthodox Church, sparking angry protests
by Christian and Moslem Arabs .
   Religious leaders in the Holy Land temporarily closed Christian
holy sites to protest the move. The Israeli Supreme Court has since
evicted most of the settlers.
   About 20 caretakers remain in the building pending a decision on
a property dispute in which the Greek church claims a former tenant
illegally sold his leasing rights to the settlers.
   The Israeli government admitted it contributed $1.8 million to
fund the controversial settlement.

<TEXT>
   Britain's unelected House of Lords is preparing to
kill government legislation to allow trials of suspected Nazi war
criminals.
   It would be the first time in modern history that the Lords,
mostly hereditary aristocrats, have rejected outright a bill passed
by the elected House of Commons.
   Nazi hunters are distressed, but some in the Lords argue that
fair trials are impossible at a distance of up to 50 years, that
the crimes were not committed on British soil, and that retroactive
legislation is unjust.
   The expected rejection of the bill, in a Lords vote on June 4,
has revived qualms about the powers still vested in this unique
collection of blue-bloods, bishops, jurists and recently ennobled
politicians, all of whom owe their place in the upper chamber to
birth or political patronage.
   However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government seems
quietly relieved at the prospect of avoiding what critics call
``show trials'' of three aging East European emigres.
   Officials have said in unattributable briefings that if the
Lords reject the War Crimes Bill at its most important legislative
stage, the second reading, the Conservative government will abandon
it.
   ``I think the government will be only too pleased,'' Lord
Ponsonby, 59, chief whip for the opposition Labor Party, said in an
interview.
   ``But it disturbs me,'' added Ponsonby, who inherited his
father's title in 1976. ``I have always held that the non-elected
House has no right to thwart the will of the elected House.''
   The Lords' power to kill legislation has gradually diminished
this century, and today they can do no more than delay bills for up
to a year.
   The government could in theory reintroduce the bill in the
Commons after the new session of Parliament opens in November. If
Commons again passed the bill, the Lords could not reject it in its
entirity.
   However, the government is not expected to take that action
because officials have privately said they will drop the measure if
the Lords kill it.
   The Commons adopted the War Crimes Bill 348-123 in December.
Mrs. Thatcher voted in favor.
   Dropping the bill would make Britain the only World War II ally
to take no action against suspected war criminals on its soil.
   Australia and Canada are holding their first trials and the
United States deports suspects for trial in Israel, including John
Demjanjuk, whose appeal of a death sentence began this week.
   In a first shot, the Lords on May 1 defeated 137-62 a separate
government measure to allow Scottish courts to accept videotaped
evidence in war crimes trials.
   The only suspect repeatedly identified in the British media,
Antanas Gecas, 73, a Lithuanian-born mining engineer, lives in
Scotland.
   He belonged to a notorious Lithuanian police battalion, and says
he witnessed atrocities but never participated in them. He is suing
the Times of London for libel.
   Among the active members of the Lords _ about 350 out of 1,178 _
life peers predominate, many of them heavyweight lawyers and top
judges.
   Lord Campbell of Alloway, a 73-year-old lawyer, Conservative
life peer and wartime prisoner of the Germans, says there is ``no
reasonable assumption of a fair trial and no appropriate
punishment.''
   Supporters of the bill point to the enormity of the crimes and
say war criminals lied their way to safety and citizenship in
Britain.
   ``Why should Britain act differently from Australia, Canada,
France, Holland and even Germany itself,'' Conservative lawmaker
John Marshall wrote to The Times.
   The Commons vote followed a government-ordered inquiry into
names submitted by the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center.
   The commission saw sufficient evidence to prosecute three
suspects and investigate 124 others, and warned that to do nothing
would taint Britain as a ``safe haven for criminals.''
   ``They (the Lords) say old men cannot stand trial, but they are
competent to pass laws,'' said the dean of the Los Angeles-based
center, Rabbi Marvin Hier. ``It's a contradiction.''
   Conservative Richard Shepherd said that despite the Commons
majority for the bill, many legislators are uneasy about mounting
the trials.
   Although it has a Conservative majority, the upper house has
consistently troubled Mrs. Thatcher by amending controversial
legislation.
   But this is the first bill since 1949 that the Lords are
threatening to throw out wholesale, according to the Lords
information office.

<HEAD>Government, Airlines Plan New Anti-Terrorist Tactics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government and airline officials said they
were considering new tactics for protecting U.S. travelers in
response Wednesday to a highly critical report on aviation
terrorism.
   The report by a presidential commission said U.S. aviation
security is ``seriously flawed'' and called for preemptive and
retaliatory miltary strikes against state-sponsored terrorists.
   That proposal brought no immediate response from the White House
or State Department.
   But the inquiry into the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 produced scores of nuts-and-bolts recommendations which
Transportation and State department officials, as well as airline
representatives, said they are considering.
   The Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism issued its
final report Tuesday on its investigation of the bombing that
killed all 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 residents of
Lockerbie, Scotland, where the plane fell.
   The proposals covered reforms in the Federal Aviation
Administration, changes in State Department policies, new laws to
require more vigilance by airlines, and a warning system to give
passengers the option of canceling passage on flights that have
been threatened.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines,
called together airline security officials for a Thursday meeting
in Washington to discuss how some of the proposals might be carried
out.
   Spokesman Tim Neill said the group would assess which proposals
might pose difficulties and try to find ways to implement some of
them without FAA action.
   One recommendation which might create problems is a call for
airlines to take primary responsiblity for the security of mail and
other cargo, Neill said. Much of the cargo arrives shrink-wrapped
or sealed in containers, he said.
   The State Department issued a statement Wednesday saying
officials were ``studying the best way to implement the
recommendations that apply to this department.''
   Ivan Selin, undersecretary of state for management, was
appointed to set up a task force to review the proposals, said
spokesman Richard Boucher.
   The department already has taken steps to deal better with
crises such as airliner bombings, including some recommended by the
commission. Victims' relatives had complained of government
insensitivity after the Lockerbie bombing.
   FAA Administrator James Busey said he dispatched a team Tuesday
to work with the commission to decide which of its recommendations
could be followed.
   Busey said he would go ahead with plans to install sophisticated
bomb detectors in six airports but would await the results of
studies of the systems before pursuing an order that airlines
install scores more.
   The commission asked the FAA to hold off on widespread
installation, saying the Thermal Neutron Analysis units likely
would not have detected the Flight 103 bomb.
   Among panel recommendations that officials are expected to
consider are:
   _ More aggressive efforts to protect American passengers abroad,
including the appointment of a special ambassador for internatonal
aviation security.
   _ Phase-in of anti-terrorist measures at U.S. airports with the
appointment of federal security coordinators at key terminals.
   _ Passage of laws to require criminal records checks of all
airport employees, to impose additional fines against airlines that
endanger passenger's lives with lax security, and to provide
financial payments to victims of terrorist acts.
   _ Increased training for airport and airline security personnel.
   _ More scrutiny of mail and cargo carried aboard airliners.
   _ Stronger security measures for checked luggage and for people
with access to airliners.
   _ Reorganizaton of the FAA to give security operations higher
status.
   _ More research and development of devices to detect the most
sophisticated terrorist bombs and of ways to reinforce airliners
against damage from small explosions.
   _ Establishment of a system for letting passengers know when an
airliner has received a credible bomb threat.
   _ More humane procedures for dealing with victims of foreign
terrorism and their family members.

   A California toy company on Wednesday recalled
262 baby rattles with small parts it said could choke or cut young
children.
   Small World Toys recalled its yellow plastic Spinflower Rattles
because the toy may break apart when dropped, ``releasing small
beads,'' the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in announcing
the recall. In addition, the federal agency said, the rattle's
``flower petals may also break off producing sharp points.''
   The rattles, sold nationwide since January 1988, was packaged in
a clear plastic carrying case with a label marked ``Fischerform.''
   Both the commission and company said there had been no reports
of injuries involving the product. Consumer may return the rattles
to the store where purchased for a refund.

   The Justice Department on Wednesday sought to
narrow the scope of a court order barring drug testing for
attorneys seeking jobs in the department's Antitrust Division.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said Tuesday that in the
absence of a reasonable suspicion of drug use, such testing
violates the constitutional right of citizens not to be searched
without cause and under a warrant.
   Gesell's ruling came in a lawsuit by a private attorney, Carl
Willner, who applied for a job in the division.
   The decision should apply only to Willner, not to all applicants
for attorney positions, the department said in court papers.
   ``The scope of this injunction is beyond the court's subject
matter jurisdiction,'' said the Justice Department motion to modify
the court order.
   Gesell said Willner lacked standing to challenge all
pre-employment drug testing at the department and its various
components.
   It follows that Willner ``likewise lacks standing to challenge
pre-employment testing of all new employees in the Antitrust
Division,'' said the Justice Department brief.

   Word of Sammy Davis Jr.'s death
from throat cancer drew friends and associates to his gated hilltop
home Wednesday.
   Actress Loretta Swit and others who identified themselves as
Hollywood producers and executives passed through a crowd of
reporters and television crews to pay a visit to Davis' widow,
Altovise.
   ``You never met anybody who lived life so fully as he,'' said
actor Roscoe Browne. ``He took the whole thing and went for it.''
   Early in the day, Davis' business manager, Shirley Rhodes, came
outside the gate to confirm to reporters that Davis had died. By
her side was one of Davis' sons, Mark.
   Asked how the family was doing, Mark Davis said, ``Pretty good.''
   ``We're just trying to get it all together, trying to get our
thoughts and nerves together,'' said Ms. Rhodes.
   She said Davis' three sons and wife were at his side when he
died in his sleep at 5:59 a.m.
   The death of the entertainment superstar created a commotion on
the quiet, twisting street lined with gated mansions. Television
news vans and reporters' cars parked under ``No Parking'' signs
along the two-lane street.
   Reporters milled under a ``No Trespassing'' sign in front of
Davis' home.
   Two Star Line Tour vans drove slowly past the home as tourists
snapped pictures through the windows. Gardeners and city workers
slowed down to ask reporters what was going on and residents drove
by in the Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches and Rolls-Royces, shaking their
heads in disgust at the crush.
   A half-dozen curiosity-seekers arrived at the home.
   Florist trucks arrived throughout the day with deliveries.

   President Bush on Wednesday accused Congress
of risking ``the hopes of freedom'' in Nicaragua and Panama by
failing to quickly pass an emergency aid bill and said lawmakers
should not leave for their Memorial Day recess before acting.
   However, he said he would not sign a bill including
``mischievous language'' providing abortion money for Washington,
D.C., as one current version does.
   Several Democrats suggested the delay wasn't their fault, and
one accused Bush of a taking a ``cheap shot'' at them to divert
attention from bigger problems such as dealing with the economy.
   The president said he has exhausted all administrative avenues
for providing aid to the three-week old government of Nicaragua's
President Violeta Chamorro and cannot legally grant her request for
an emergency $40 million loan. The Treasury Department cannot make
such loans without assurance Nicaragua would get U.S. aid or other
revenues to pay it back.
   Bush renewed his plea for congressional movement on his proposal
for $300 million for Nicaragua and $500 million for the new
pro-American government of Panama.
   ``We must not let the procedural gridlock in Congress destroy
the hopes of freedom in these two fledgling democracies,'' the
president said.
   Bush added, however, that he will veto any aid package that
reaches his desk with language that approves federal money for
abortions in the District of Columbia.
   He blasted Congress for piling on that and other amendments
``that have absolutely nothing to do with Nicaragua and Panama.''
   ``The American people are frustrated by the inability of
Congress to do business in a prompt and orderly fashion,'' said
Bush.
   On Capitol Hill, however, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said that
``nobody is screaming in my district'' about aid to Nicaragua and
Panama. Instead, he said, they are talking about education, health
care, the budget deficit and other domestic issues.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said Bush was merely taking a ``cheap
shot'' at Congress in order to take attention away from bigger
problems.
   The House, he said, has followed its rules, only to be thrown
off course by Republicans in the House and Senate.
   Democrats indicated it was unlikely the money bill would be
passed before the end of next week when Congress is scheduled to
begin its Memorial Day recess.
   Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia retorted that the
Democrats were guilty of ``destructively irresponsible actions,''
that the two nations were being jeopardized by ``petty
congressional games.''
   The Nicaragua-Panama aid package is tangled in a legislative
knot.
   First, the House must pass an authorization bill to spend the
money. That bill, which has already passed the Senate, will be
taken up by the House on Monday. It includes a Democrat-driven
proposal to hold back military aid for El Salvador in 1990 and 1991
in an effort to promote peace negotiations in that war-torn Central
American country.
   At the same time, House-Senate negotiators met Wednesday
afternoon to deal with the appropriations bill, which has billions
of dollars of domestic projects attached to it. They didn't finish
work on the measure.
   Bush first requested the Panama aid in January and added the
Nicaragua request following Mrs. Chamorro's election on Feb. 25.
   With add-on amendments, he said, the bill has tripled in size.
   The president said he wanted passage of a bill this week or
early next week and, failing that, ``I will call on the Congress to
remain in session until it completes action on a bill I can sign.''
   ``The situation in Nicaragua is critical,'' Bush said. ``Mrs.
Chamorro's government is absolutely bankrupt.''
   Bush said he had even asked his aides to look into whether the
government could encourage private lending to help the new
Nicaraguan government through its economic crisis, but that such
lenders would run into the same type of collateral problem the U.S.
government has.
   Mrs. Chamorro sent Bush a May 11 cable requesting a $40 million
bridge loan to enable her to get through the immediate financial
crisis.
   She said the Sandinista government that preceded her had run the
treasury dry and left reserves that will not get the country
through the next month.
   She is beset by a paralyzing pro-Sandinista strike by government
workers nationwide.
   Striking public employees have occupied public buildings, phone
service has been interrupted and other public utilities and
services impeded by the strike.
   Officially, the strikers want a 200 percent pay raise, a
subsidized food package, rehiring of a labor leader fired Monday,
and the demobilization of the Contra rebels.
   In the Nicaragua aid package that the administration is seeking,
$30 million would be earmarked for humanitarian aid and
resettlement of the Contras who are stationed in five temporary
encampments within Nicaragua while they disarm and resettle.
   Organization of American States officials, who are distributing
food to the Contras, say the Contras will be out of food by the
weekend.
   Some administration officials have said that could unravel the
whole peace process that brought the rebels to the camps, because
they still have their weapons and might leave the security zones
and get into conflict with Sandinista soldiers.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Arab countries have been
unable to negotiate a mutually acceptable U.N. Security Council
resolution criticizing Israeli settlements in occupied territories
as a violation of international law, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   The Arab countries have temporarily abandoned their effort to
draft such a resolution, partly because the negotiations were
unsuccessful, said the officials, who commented on condition of
anonymity.
   Israel has protested the joint U.S.-Arab effort.
   Officially, the State Department said only that it would
withhold comment on the subject until it sees a final text of any
Arab resolution.
   The Arab nations were hoping to come up with a resolution that
would both criticize Israel and not be vetoed by the United States.
   They are concerned about the increasing flow of Soviet Jewish
refugees to Israel and the prospect that large numbers would be
resettled in territory seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
   This would make more difficult the fulfillment of the Arab goal
of establishing a Palestinian state in those areas.
   But Israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees
have been resettled in either the West Bank or Gaza Strip or in
East Jerusalem.
   The State Department has generally sided with the Arab position
that Soviet Jews not be settled in the occupied territories.
   Officials have said that a request for a $400 million U.S. loan
guarantee to house the Soviet emigres would be jeopardized if
Soviet Jews are resettled in these areas.
   The administration has expressed opposition to all settlement
activities in the territories but it has stopped short of saying
they are illegal.
   Israel believed that the United States, by trying to cooperate
with the Arab countries on the issue, was going along with what it
described as an Arab effort to block the flow of Soviet Jews to
Israel.
   The settlement issue is one of several on which the United
States and Israel have been in disagreement but the Bush
administration maintains that it continues to view Israel as a
close ally.

   Mutinous soldiers abandoned their
nine-hour siege of the capital's international airport on Wednesday
after senior officers, backed up by armored cars, promised them
more pay and allowances.
   Earlier, other soldiers gave up their occupation of the state
television station, which had continued to broadcast.
   Defense Minister Charles Konan Bany told a news conference the
soldiers' demands were being considered and that Wednesday's events
should not be exaggerated. He said no casualties were reported,
although soldiers fired into the air throughout Abidjan, and that
the soldiers returned to barracks.
   Bany said the airport could not resume operations immediately
because key civilian personnel had fled.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said an official notice was issued advising Americans not to travel
to the Ivory Coast because of unrest, which he attributed to
dissident elements in the Ivorian military. He said central Abidjan
was not affected and no one was reported hurt.
   Senior military officers arrived minutes before a 5 p.m.
deadline set by the soldiers for negotiations on their demands.
Four armored cars were sent to the airport but did not intervene.
   Minutes after the officers entered the airport, the rebellious
soldiers ran back to their barracks outside the airport.
   Several told reporters the government promised to meet their
demands _ ``But if they do not confirm this officially and
publicly, we will be back.''
   The airport was closed all day but one light aircraft was
allowed to land, diplomats said.
   Bany earlier accused some soldiers of banditry and urged all of
them to lay down their arms and return to their barracks.
   Soldiers at the airport, some armed with automatic rifles and
wearing red bandanas, accused Bany of stealing millions of dollars
from the military budget and threatened to shoot him if he came to
the airport.
   Other soldiers commandeered taxis and government cars for joy
rides around the capital. Some stood up through sunroofs and waved
at passers-by. They set up roadblocks and pulled people out of
vehicles for questioning, particularly those traveling in
government cars.
   Main roads were littered with cars, many carrying official
license plates, apparently abandoned by soldiers when they ran out
of gas.
   Many stores, banks and international agencies like the African
Development Bank closed and sent their staff home. The U.S. Embassy
advised Americans to stay indoors and not travel around the city.
   At one roadblock, soldiers with loaded weapons complained of
being paid only $14 a month and of having to buy their own uniforms
and shoes. They showed reporters torn uniforms and holes in their
shoes.
   Wednesday's events were the latest in a wave of protests that
began when the government, unable to pay its foreign debt and
having trouble meeting payrolls, tried to impose austerity measures
in March. Violent protests forced the government to close schools
and suspend the austerity measures. The first public calls were
heard for President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to retire.
   Houphouet-Boigny also gave in to demands that opposition parties
be allowed to form for the first time since he came to power, when
Ivory Coast became independent from France in 1960. He is Africa's
longest-serving president.
   Until the trouble, this West African nation was one of the most
stable in Africa. It is the world's biggest cocoa producer. Its
problems began with falling prices of cocoa and coffee, the main
exports of its agriculture-based economy. Cocoa prices for July
delivery on international markets soared to their highest levels in
nearly 14 mohths in response to the soldiers' actions.

<TEXT>
   President Bush heard advocates and critics of
a civil rights bill agree Wednesday that women who suffer job
discrimination deserve the same right to damages as minorities.
   Bush held two more meetings with a wide range of interest groups
as he pressed for a compromise to avoid an embarrassing veto of the
measure, which would reverse six 1989 Supreme Court rulings that
narrowed protection against bias in the workplace.
   ``We're in the listening stage here with reasonably open
minds,'' Bush said as he sat down with representatives of women's
groups, the disabled and others.
   He held a separate session with Hispanic leaders, and met Monday
with black civil rights advocates.
   ``We're working hard to get an agreement,'' Bush said at a
midday news conference. ``I hope we can narrow the differences
enough so that we can go forward together on this legislation.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said last month that he might
recommend a veto of the Kennedy-Hawkins bill because it smacks of
quotas.
   Bush has supported his own legislation to undo two of the six
high court rulings. But he has not agreed to support damages for
those who suffer discrimination based on sex and religion. The law
already entitles minorities and ethnic group members to damages in
such instances.
   But even conservative activists who fear that the
Kennedy-Hawkins bill would force employers to resort to quotas
support damages for women and religious group members.
   ``The issue that we all seem to be very much in support of, even
our colleagues from different standpoints, was that we want
damages,'' said Anne Bryant, executive director, American
Association of University Women.
   Linda Dorian, executive director of Business and Professional
Women USA, said the law also needs to ``give some finality to
consent decrees (that) have resulted in a lot of gains for women
and minorities.''
   A Supreme Court ruling has reopened cases previously settled by
consent decrees.
   Mark Liedel, director of special projects for the Heritage
Foundation, castigated the Kennedy-Hawkins bill, saying it would
``create a quota system.'' But he added, ``There is a need to put
damages into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.''
   Carey Stacy, president of the National Association of Women
Business Owners, said ``the civil rights of employers may be in
jeopardy. ... We would go around being guilty until proven
innocent.''
   Judy Golub of the American Jewish Committee said, ``We are
convinced that nothing in this act creates or condones ... quotas.''
   The civil rights bill _ named after chief sponsors Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif. _ has not
passed either the House or Senate.

   Little has changed in blighted Liberty City in the
decade since three days of bloody race rioting left 18 people dead.
   Except, perhaps, things have gotten worse.
   Expectations that stark social problems highlighted by the riots
would be remedied have dwindled as few concrete changes
materialized.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez, elected in 1985, agreed relief efforts have
been slow in coming. ``Apparently, at the time there was a lot of
promising going on,'' he said.
   Typifying Liberty City dilemmas is that of Darnell, Rudolph and
Leroy Taylor, who sell hubcaps and used appliances from a scarred
Liberty City street corner. They say local authorities have been
little help.
   ``On every corner they got cocaine. But they don't want nobody
selling hubcaps,'' said Leroy Taylor, brother of Rudolph and uncle
of Darnell. ``They stop us, but they can't stop the cocaine boys.''
   Their complaints echo those of others who lament the lack of
progress made since Liberty City and other inner-city Miami
neighborhoods exploded on May 17, 1980, after five white police
officers were acquitted in the beating death of black insurance
executive Arthur McDuffie.
   The Taylors' 6-month-old business consists of about 20 stacks of
hubcaps, set in from a neat row of tires. The men say they make
about $25 a day.
   ``We are free-market entrepreneurs,'' said Rudolph Taylor, 54,
who is disabled and holds a county peddler's license. But an
inspector recently told the trio their business violated county
codes and ordered them to move.
   The Taylors say they have no money to start up a permanent
business, or to afford insurance, licenses and other costs. They
are not alone.
   A 1989 Dade County report summarized the causes of the 1980 riot
and three other violent civil disturbances later in the decade as:
``lack of economic opportunity and economic and political power,
lack of concern on the part of civic leaders, housing problems,
unemployment, police-community relations and the criminal justice
system in general.''
   In December 1979, McDuffie led police on a chase after running a
stop sign on his motorcycle. When they caught him, they battered
him with nightsticks and heavy flashlights, one of the officers
testified at the trial moved to Tampa because of publicity.
   McDuffie spent four days in a coma, then died. The five
Metro-Dade officers were acquitted by an all-white jury.
   ``I just didn't see how these people could get away like that
when they just brutally murdered him,'' said his brother, Lewis
McDuffie.
   The rioting that ensued left 18 dead, 270 wounded and caused at
least $100 million in property damage.
   Police Sgt. Wayne Knowles, a 19-year-veteran of the force who
grew up near Liberty City, said he saw ``terrible things'' while
battling rioters. Things have gotten worse, he said.
   The availability of high-powered weapons is a growing problem,
as is crack cocaine. Addicts steal everything that can be sold as
scrap from vacant houses, making them irreparable, Knowles said.
Often, the homes become crack houses.
   Educator Marvin Dunn, author of a book on the McDuffie riot and
its aftermath, said government has been slow or ineffective in
improving Liberty City, but he praised the private sector for its
contribution to rebuilding efforts.
   ``These people raised $7 million out of their own pockets and
they get very little recognition for it,'' he said. ``It's not that
what they did made that much difference, but it did say to the
black community, `We haven't given up on you.'''
   Dunn estimates $35 million in federal, state and private funds
was spent in the area after the 1980 riot.
   ``Millions of it got squandered away in so-called training
programs for new business leaders and just all kinds of exotic
things that didn't translate into bricks and mortar in that
community.''
   Meanwhile, under the rusty old lights that once illuminated a
grocery parking lot, the Taylors sell an occasional hubcap _ and
hope they can stay in business.
   ``If I don't have a job, I'll try to make my own job,'' Darnell
said. ``We do the best we can.''

</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARKANSAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Flooding caused almost $6.11 million in damage to farm buildings
and structures and $12.48 million in damage to farmland. Figure
does not include damage to crops. About 281,000 acres of cropland
hve been affected, primarily along the Arkansas and Red rivers.
Floods could affect about 13 percent of Arkansas' expected 1.38
million acres of wheat.

<HEAD>ILLINOIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rains caused swollen streams to flood their banks in
southern Illinois, prompting the evacuation of several families.

<HEAD>KANSAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Six farms near Whitewater in southeast Kansas were damaged by a
tornado and flash flood watches continued in the wake of
thunderstorms and heavy rains that added water to already saturated
ground.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LOUISIANA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Along the Red River, 700,000 acres of farms and woods will be
inundated. Water forced 225 people out of their homes in northwest
Louisiana. Another 135 were flooded out downstream in Rapides,
Natchitoches and Red River parishes. More than 400 homes in the
Shreveport area remain threatened. In Red River Parish, some 38,400
acres of parish farmland _ a third of all farmland in the parish _
have been affected by floodwaters. Some 20,000 acres of farmland
have been swamped in Natchitoches Parish along Bayou Pierre and
near Black Lake.

   Storms dumped heavy rain on the eastern half of the state. Up to
300 people were evacuated from their homes on Kansas City's East
Side because of flooding caused by nearly 7 inches of rain on the
Big Blue and Little Blue rivers and Brush Creek. In nearby Blue
Springs, at least 60 homes were evacuated after rain threatened to
burst the dam of a private lake.

<HEAD>OKLAHOMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Flooding was largely over except around Lake Texoma, a tornado
late Tuesday killed one person and injured eight in Stillwater.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TEXAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old cleanup worker drowned along the Red River in
northeast Texas when he was swept away by floodwaters, bringing the
total of flood-related deaths in Texas to 13.
   The first crest of what is expected to be the worst flood in 80
years edged its way into the Liberty area and floodwaters could
inundate 200 square miles of bottom land near the Trinity River in
southeast Texas.
   The Trinity River Authority, which began allowing record amounts
of water flow from Lake Livingston Dam on Tuesday, continued to
release 88,000 cubic feet per second this morning. The release is
expected to inundate about 20 percent of the 990 square mile area
below Lake Livingston.

   Lithuania's parliament offered Wednesday
to suspend laws it has enacted since declaring the republic's
independence if the Kremlin agrees to negotiate.
   The resolution adopted by the Lithuanian Supreme Council aimed
at breaking Lithuania's impasse with Moscow, but parliament
spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said it did not involve rescinding the
republic's March 11 declaration of independence as the Kremlin has
demanded.
   The offer will be delivered to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Thursday, she said.
   Ms. Dapkus said the proposal closely resembled the compromise
suggested last month by French and German leaders, but adds a
transition period before full independence and concrete proposals
on military cooperation, economic plans and other topics.
   Gorbachev spokesman Arkady Maslennikov has said the proposal by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand went ``along the lines'' of Gorbachev's thinking, but
stopped short of calling it acceptable.
   Gorbachev pronounced Lithuania's declaration of independence
invalid in March and followed up with economic sanctions, including
a partial blockade that officials say has left the republic of 3.8
million on the verge of running out of fuel.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said Tuesday she
believed talks with Moscow could begin as early as this week.
   A leader of neighboring Latvia said Wednesday that talks on
Baltic independence would start next week with midlevel Kremlin
officials. Estonia's Premier Edgar Savisaar appealed Wednesday for
U.S. help to smooth the way.
   Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ilmars Bisers, just back from
meetings in Moscow, said talks with Soviet officials would focus on
``the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty with the
Soviet Union.''
   Savisaar also appealed to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to discuss the Baltic republics' drive for independence in his
meetings this week with Soviet leaders in Moscow, the Estonian news
agency ETA said.
   All three Baltic republics were reported to be calm Wednesday,
one day after thousands of anti-independence protesters converged
on government buildings in Riga, the capital of Latvia, and
Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.
   In Moscow, Baker said he would press Soviet leaders to explain
why they have not begun talks with Baltic leaders.
   ``It's not encouraging to us to see the absence of a dialogue
between leaders there and the Kremlin,'' Baker said.
   In Washington, President Bush said the standoff between Moscow
and the Baltic republics ``certainly puts some tension'' on his May
30-June 3 summit.
   Gorbachev has offered Latvia and Estonia ``special status'' in a
revamped Soviet federation in late April. They chose instead to
pursue their drives for gradual, but full independence.
   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were independent states before
they were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Their open
defiance of Moscow has stirred activists in other republics _
including Russia _ to begin talking about starting their own open
campaigns for independence from the Soviet Union, a federation of
15 republics.
   About 100 volunteer guards surrounded the parliament building in
Riga on Wednesday.
   In Tallinn, more than 2,000 men signed up for an unarmed ``Home
Guard'' to protect key government buildings and communications
lines, ETA reported.
   The guard was formed under a new government decree prompted by
what Savisaar called a failed ``coup attempt'' on Tuesday, when a
crowd of several thousand protesters tried to occupy Tallinn's
government building.
   A similar confrontation occurred Tuesday in Riga, where for the
second day whistling and jeering Soviet soldiers tried to muscle
into the Latvian Parliament building, but were blocked by
pro-independence crowds.
   The Estonian anti-independence protesters have threatened a
general strike May 21 unless their demands are met by Thursday,
according to Interfax, a news service of official Radio Moscow.
   They want the immediate resignation of the republic's government
and a referendum on Estonia's campaign to secede from the Soviet
Union.
   Savisaar also told Baker in a telegram about Tuesday's attempts
by Moscow loyalists to occupy Estonian government buildings,
reported The Estonian Independent, a pro-independence newspaper.
   Savisaar told Baker the Estonian government ``would be deeply
surprised were the incidents in Estonia and Latvia not to find
reverberation'' in his talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   It was unclear whether the anti-independence protests in Estonia
and Latvia were coordinated from Moscow or organized by Soviet
loyalists in the republics.

<HEAD>Civil Libertarians Attack Bush Forfeiture Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil libertarians on Wednesday attacked a
Bush administration plan to allow federal law enforcement agencies
greater authority to seize the assets of accused criminals.
   The proposed legislation would allow the seizure of the ``gross
receipts'' gained from a wide variety of crimes before a defendant
was convicted. The crimes include mail and wire fraud, procurement
fraud, computer fraud and credit card fraud.
   ``Isn't this contrary to our principle of presumption of
innocence?'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., asked Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
   Edwards, a civil liberties advocate, chairs the panel's
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. He noted that
Congress already had authorized asset seizures for accused drug
traffickers.
   But ``this pre-trial seizure of property was supposed to be an
extraordinary remedy dictated by the unique nature of the drug
cases,'' he said.
   Thornbugh said he didn't believe the asset forfeiture violated a
defendant's presumption of innocence. He noted that the Supreme
Court recently upheld such seizures in racketeering cases.
   Thornburgh noted also that Congress recently authorized similar
seizures of the fruits of alleged savings and loan fraud in
addition to drug trafficking and racketeering.
   ``White-collar criminals, drug traffickers, organized crime
chieftains are all committing criminal acts for one purpose only,
to make money,'' Thornburgh said. ``To the extent we can neutralize
their ability to make money through their illegal activities, we
are serving, I believe, the public interest.''
   Edwards responded: ``The problem in your response is that you
say `illegal activities.' These these people are innocent until
proven guilty under our American system.''
   ``It's a sad thing when the Justice Department is proposing this
kind of institutional injustice where the police can seize your
property and stick out their tongues at you,'' said Arthur Spitzer,
an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``It's done too often on too low a standard of proof and without
adequate procedures so the person is presumed guilty until he
proves himself innocent and often doesn't have an opportunity to
prove himself innocent.''
   The bill would extend to a new set of crimes the asset-seizure
provisions in crime laws enacted by Congress in 1984 and 1986.
   As a result of such legislation, the Justice Department's asset
forfeiture fund has grown from $27.2 million collected in 1985 to
$580 million that was seized in the 1989 fiscal year.
   The measure would allow the U.S. Postal Service and the Treasury
Department to initiate administrative forfeiture proceedings
arising from mail fraud, credit card fraud and violation of customs
statutes.

<HEAD>No Further Penalties Planned For China, Bush Tells Congress</HEAD>

   President Bush said Wednesday he plans no
further sanctions against China although the administration retains
serious concerns about violations of human rights there.
   Even though Beijing has made ``a number of limited positive
steps'' since the United States imposed sanctions against the
Chinese government last year, ``the effect of the positive steps
has been diluted and in some cases negated by new restrictive
measures,'' Bush said in a report to Congress on U.S.-China
relations.
   Still, he wrote, the United States should continue dialogue with
China, and ``flexible application of existing U.S. policy steps
could help us to restore a sounder basis for relations with China
in the years ahead.''
   ``We continue to have serious concerns about the human rights
situation in China'' where, he said, little has changed since the
violent suppression of pro-democracy movement last June.
   ``While the most overt forms of repression, army patrols and
arrests, have diminished, this is largely due to a climate of
intimidation that inhibits open dissent,'' Bush's report said. ``We
are prepared to take further steps should conditions in China so
warrant, but for the moment we regard the existing level of
suspensions as appropriate.''
   Restrictive measures imposed by Beijing, he said in the report,
include a new regulation requiring university graduates to work for
five years before being permitted to study abroad.
   Other regressive steps mentioned were government control of the
media, arts, trade unions and nongovernmental organizations;
heavy-handed surveillance and harassment of foreign journalists;
imprisonment of political prisoners and dissidents including
several hundred in Tibet; continued detention of a few thousand
participants in last June's pro-democracy uprisings;
   Talking briefly about China in a news conference Wednesday, Bush
said he has not decided whether to extend China's status as a
country receiving ``most favored nation'' trading status from the
United States.
   Bush must decide by June 3 whether to recommend continuation of
that status, which guarantees a country that it will get the best
U.S. tariffs for its exports that any other country gets.
   ``That issue is under ... lively discussion,'' Bush told
reporters. Included in the discussion is consideration of what the
impact would be on Hong Kong, which is to become part of China in
1997, Bush indicated.
   ``It isn't an easy call because I don't want to send a signal
that we are happy with the human rights record,'' Bush said. ``I
still am of the mind that having contact and working in area where
there has been progress on the economic side with China is
important.''
   Congress in February asked Bush to report on the affect of the
U.S. sanctions imposed on China in the wake of Beijing's violent
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations last June.
   The report released by the White House on Wednesday concluded
generally that ``It is difficult to assess precisely what impact
U.S. and multilateral measures have had on China ... Clearly
China's own retrenchment policies, not external sanctions, have
been the principal factor behind economic developments in China
over the past year.''
   The sanctions included suspension of nuclear and military sales
and exchanges, although the administration has since lifted
restriction on some exports such as communications equipment that
are not considered to be of weapons use; and suspension of
guarantees for new investments in China by the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., a government-backed agency that insures U.S.
investments abroad.
   The president, a former U.S. ambassador to China, maintains that
despite his disappointment over China's policies, the world's most
populous country has too much geopolitical importance to be
isolated by the United States.
   Trade between the United States and China surpassed $18 billion
last year, making China the United States' 10th largest trading
partner, he said.

<HEAD>Suit Filed To Nullify `Bonfire of the Vanities' Courtroom Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An order by the state's chief justice
barring a ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' film crew from a county
courthouse was challenged in court Wednesday by the county and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz acted because he said the script
called for a scene that showed blacks acting in ``a riotous,
lawless and life-threatening manner.''
   He said the scene could cause black moviegoers to lose faith in
the justice system. The Warner Bros. film crew can use the
courthouse if the scene is dropped, Wilentz said.
   Warner production crews are looking elsewhere for a courthouse
and are withholding $250,000 that Essex County would have been paid
for use of the building.
   ``He's violating the First Amendment,'' said county Executive
Nicholas Amato. ``He's also costing the taxpayers in Essex County a
lot of money, and for what?''
   The movie is based on the Tom Wolfe novel of the same name about
a white Wall Street bond salesman, Sherman McCoy, who is thrust
into the court system of the Bronx after he accidentally kills a
black youth.
   Wilentz, invoking his authority as chief of the court system in
New Jersey, objected to a scene that shows a metal gate being
slammed in the faces of a black mob after the charges against McCoy
are dismissed.
   ``A work of fiction, as opposed to a documentary, can exaggerate
to make a point,'' said Warner publicist Rob Harris. ``We think
what the judge has done is unreasonable, but we're not waiting for
him to change his mind.''
   Warner is not part of the lawsuit because it cannot wait for it
to be settled to complete filming the movie scene.
   The suit says Wilentz is ``unlawfully seeking to censor,
restrict and regulate the content of the movie,'' in violation of
First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech.
   It asks that Wilentz be barred from prohibiting use of the
courthouse and seeks unspecified compensatory damages.
   Wilentz had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it,
said state courts spokesman Carl Golden.
   ``His position hasn't changed though,'' Golden said.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
supported Wilentz, calling it ``reprehensible'' for public property
to ``be party to perpetuating racist stereotypes.''
   Earlier this month, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer
objected to a New York courthouse being used for filming because
the movie depicts the area as dangerous.
   ``What the scene depicts is rage over the outcome,'' Harris
said. ``The judge seemed to think that that rage could be conveyed
through two people engaged in dialogue.
   ``If he really thinks that, I wouldn't want to see any movie he
would direct.''

   A toll-free hotline is being set up to tell
people about federal compensation for people injured by
vaccinations, officials said Wednesday.
   The hotline, which opens Friday, is part of the Health Resources
and Services Administration's efforts to publicize an Oct. 1
deadline for claims against the National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program.
   The program provides compensation for injuries from vaccines for
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps,
rubella and polio.
   Claims for injuries that occurred before Oct. 1, 1988, when the
program began, must be filed by Oct. 1 this year.
   If the deadline is missed, these claims could still be pursued
in court, a far slower, more costly and complicated procedure.
   Claims for injuries that occurred after Oct. 1, 1988 must be
filed against various deadlines according to a complicated schedule
set out in the law.
   As of May 11, the program had paid $32 million in 62 cases.
   On Tuesday, Boston lawyer Michael Hugo, who represents people
injured by vaccines, and a group of parents filed a lawsuit aimed
at forcing federal health officials to generate more publicity for
the compensation program.
   The hotline was planned before the lawsuit was filed, officials
said.

<TEXT>
   Chess Studios, where so much musical history was
made that the Rolling Stones once used its address as a song title,
was voted a landmark Wednesday by the City Council.
   The council voted unanimously to honor the two-story, brick and
terra cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. where Chuck Berry,
Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and others made music together over the
years.
   A celebration commemorating the 79-year-old building was
scheduled for June 7, timed in conjunction with the city's annual
blues festival.
   ``I think it's one of the greatest honors bestowed upon us,''
Phil Chess said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his Tucson,
Ariz. home. ``I just wish my brother was around to accept the
honor, really, but that's life.''
   Chess Records was born in 1950, evolving from another label
owned by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1957, the Polish
immigrants moved their label and studios to Michigan Avenue, across
the street from the old Lexington Hotel, gangster Al Capone's
one-time headquarters.
   The studio was home to recording sessions that gave American
music a whole new sound in the 1950s.
   Berry recorded ``Johnny B. Goode.'' Howlin' Wolf cut
``Spoonful.'' Diddley made ``You Can't Judge a Book by Looking at
the Cover.'' And Waters recorded ``I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man.''
   Chess said radio station program directors were slow to
broadcast the blues artists, but others were listening, mostly
young people.
   The urban blues and rock 'n' roll from Chess caught on, making
its way across the Atlantic and returning transformed by groups
forming the British Invasion of the early 1960s.
   ``The English groups are the ones that had the influence of
making the pop stations play the blues, mainly by white artists,
but later they started playing black artists too,'' Chess said.
   The Rolling Stones took their name from Waters' 1950 record,
``Rolling Stone,'' one of Chess' first releases. In 1964, they
recorded cuts for their ``12 x 5'' album at Chess, including the
song ``2120 South Michigan Avenue.''
   Chess flourished until 1969, when the family sold the operation.
Leonard Chess died of a heart attack that fall. The Chess catalog
is now owned by MCA Records.
   The building is owned by former Chess session-guitarist Gerald
Sims. A crooked line of stick-on numbers gives the address. There
are two remaining commercial tenants and an ``Office Space for
Lease'' sign is taped to the front window.
   But Sims has big plans for 2120.
   He wants to build a museum on the first floor. The studios are
still operable and were used by rock star John Mellencamp last fall
to record a 90-minute performance aimed at promoting the building
for landmark status.
   ``All musicians need inspiration and we hope that by setting up
a shrine to some of these great musicians that came through there
and recorded some of their music there it will inspire some of the
young people to go on and do great things,'' Sims said.

<HEAD>Iran Official Demands Release of Moslems or No Hostage Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iranian official on Wednesday
demanded the release of Moslems held in Israel and Lebanon, and
indicated no more Western hostages would be freed until there is a
reciprocal gesture.
   ``Iran has intensified its efforts to secure the release of
hostages in the past months,'' Hussein Moussavian, Iran's director
of Western European affairs, said after meeting officials of the
European Economic Community.
   ``We believe that goodwill should be shown against goodwill,''
he said.
   At a news conference after the three-hour meeting at Dublin
Castle, Moussavian said Western countries only care about their
captives and accused the West of racism.
   He also adamantly stated that Iran will not retract its death
sentence against Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie.
   Iran and Britain severed diplomatic relations last year after
Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called
on Moslems to kill Rushdie on grounds that his novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
   Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the 12-nation
community, made no statement after the meeting.
   But the talks appeared to have made no progress toward securing
freedom for the remaining 16 Western hostages despite modest hopes
raised after Iran requested the meeting. In the past month Iran has
helped free two of the six Americans held by pro-Iranian Moslem
captors in Lebanon.
   Those six Americans including the longest-held hostage, Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Seven citizens of EEC states are also held. They include three
Britons, a dual British and Irish national, an Italian, two West
Germans. Two Swiss Red Cross workers are being held in Lebanon.
   Asked why Iran has not followed up efforts that helped free
Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed the past month, Moussavian
said Lebanese groups holding Westerners now expect to see Moslem
captives freed.
   ``It is only the expectation of the Lebanese groups that the
other side also makes a gesture and releases hostages,'' said
Moussavian. He spoke through an interpreter at the Iranian embassy.
   ``This is their expectation, that the other side should show
goodwill, and we think they are right,'' he said.
   Moussavian said Israel and Christian groups hold hundreds of
Moslem hostages.
   Moussavian spoke to reporters after meeting the foreign affairs
political directors of Ireland, France and Italy. Those countries
represent the past, present and future presidents of the EEC.
   The meeting marked the community's first formal talks with Iran
since that country, in a move toward improving relations with the
West, appointed an ambassador to the European trade bloc last March.
   Moussavian sidestepped questions on whether the plight of
individual hostages was raised.
   ``The feeling has come to us that the Western countries are
racist, talking only about their own hostages, and they attach no
value to the Iranian and Moslem hostages whose numbers are
tenfold,'' he said.
   He reiterated Iran's demand that the West secure the release of
four Iranians believed seized by Christian militiamen in Lebanon.
British officials said the four have most likely been killed.
   Moussavian said Iran's trade relations with the community were
good and the only major political problem was the controversy over
Rushdie.
   Iran is demanding that Britain condemn Rushdie and ban his
novel. Britain says this would contravene freedom of speech.
   ``We should consider a boundary line between freedom and respect
for the beliefs of people,'' Moussavian said. ``Unfortunately, this
line and boundary has not been maintained by Western countries.''

   President Bush and his wife Barbara expressed
sadness Wednesday upon learning of the deaths of entertainment
greats Sammie Davis Jr. and Jim Henson.
   The White House released tributes to both men.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Bushes were ``long-time
admireres of Mr. Davis, who has given a lifetime to bringing joy to
others through his special entertainment and good will.''
   ``Mr. Davis has been a major figure in the entertainment world.
His legacy of humor and songs, as well as charity work, will
continue to be a part of future generations,'' the spokesman said.
   The Bushes spoke last Saturday by telephone to Davis' wife as
the 64-year-old entertainer lay dying of cancer.
   On the sudden death from a bacterial infection of Henson, the
53-year-old creator of the Muppets, Mrs. Bush's press office
released a statement saying:
   ``Mr. Henson's pioneering contribution through the educational
and entertaining Sesame Street and Muppets characters was unique in
the history of television.
   ``His dedication to wholesome children's programming has
enlivened the minds of young and old alike. Mr. Henson's
originality and creativity will influence entertainers, educators
and, most important of all, children for generations to come.''
   Mrs. Bush recently appeared on Sesame Street to promote her
literacy campaign.

<HEAD>Albanian Family Ends 4{-Year Refuge in Italian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six members of an Albanian family that took refuge
in the Italian Embassy in Tirana for 4{ years left Albania's
capital Wednesday after their government reached an accord with
Rome, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Italian state television said the asylum-seekers were taken in a
Red Cross van from the embassy in Tirana and driven to the airport.
   In its statement, the Italian Foreign Ministry said one of its
officials was accompanying the two brothers and four sisters, aged
57 to 65, on a special flight to Rome.
   Without giving details, the statement said the Popa family was
able to leave the embassy ``following an accord reached between the
Italian and Albanian governments, thanks also to the intervention''
of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   After arriving in Rome from Albania, Perez de Cuellar said
Monday the Albania government was prepared to resolve the case soon.
   The Popa family entered the embassy on Dec. 12, 1985, and sought
political asylum.
   Their father, a pharmacist, had been accused of collaborating
with Italian Fascist occupiers during World War II.
   The Albanian government had long refused to allow the family to
leave the country, but a few weeks ago indicated it would be
willing to let the six emigrate.
   The case turned into a cause celebre in Italy, where all parties
in Parliament united in urging the Rome government last year not to
surrender the Popas.
   
   ``The happy solution of the Popa case cannot help but influence
the future course of Italian-Albanian relations, which in the last
months had already experienced a positive evolution due to the
first openings in a democratic sense of the Tirana government,''
the Foreign Ministry said in its statement.
   In recent months, the Albanian regime has shown signs of easing
its rigid isolationist stance.

   A homeless woman who allegedly abducted her
daughter from a hospital last week returned the girl Wednesday
despite her fears that the child would undergo heart surgery, which
she opposes for religious reasons.
   Police said 12-year-old Kimberly Winfield was in good condition.
They said her mother, Carolyn L. Winfield, 35, a Jehovah's Witness,
was arrested and charged with one count of felony child abduction.
A bond hearing was set for Thursday.
   Dr. D. Woodrow Benson, head of cardiology at Children's Memorial
Hospital, examined Kimberly and said her condition had not worsened
during her absence.
   The child, who suffers from two weakened heart valves, was
abducted before a scheduled court hearing last Thursday on a state
agency's effort to obtain an order to proceed with the surgery over
Ms. Winfield's objection.
   David Schneidman, of the Illinois Children and Family Services
Department, said Wednesday that while Kimberly's heart condition
was not immediately life-threatening, hospital officials had said
it was advisable she be treated within a month.
   Schneidman said the mother and daughter, who disappeared early
on May 11, were spotted Wednesday morning at an apartment that
Catholic Charities, not realizing who she was, was trying to help
her rent.
   A neighbor who talked with Ms. Winfield learned that Kimberly
was inside the apartment and contacted Catholic Charities.
   Before police arrived, however, Ms. Winfield decided to
surrender, said Schneidman.
   Schneidman said Kimberly and her brothers were in his agency's
custody because the family was homeless. He said the department
will continue to seek a court order to allow doctors to operate on
Kimberly, whose heart problems developed after an attack of
rheumatic fever when she was 5.
   ``We don't step in simply because religious beliefs dictate
against medical procedure,'' said Schneidman. ``We do step in if a
child is being abused or neglected. Here, it was obvious they
needed help.''
   Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions on religious
grounds. They cite a section of Leviticus that reads: ``whatsoever
man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut him off from among his
people.''

<NOTE>Eds: The following combines parts of the separate Davis and Henson
obit stories for members desiring one story.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment world lost two major figures on Wednesday,
Sammy Davis Jr., who danced and sang in the spotlight, and Jim
Henson, whose creative genius gave center stage to Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Henson, who created Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and Big Bird,
died unexpectedly of complications from pneumonia. He was 53.
   Davis, who became an entertainment institution as the gilded
song-and-dance man who ``could do it all,'' died after an
eight-month battle with throat cancer. He was 64.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills commented on hearing of Henson's death.
   And Joey Bishop, who with Davis, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin
formed the core of Hollywood's fun-loving, high-living but
hard-working ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s, said of Davis: ``I guess
they need a good show up in heaven, that's all I can say. He was a
wonderful person.''

<HEAD>Henson Dies At New York Hospital</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Henson had been admitted to New York Hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated for at least three
days, the hospital said. He was 53.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at the hospital, said
Henson apparently came down with the flu on Friday in North
Carolina, and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the
pneumonia.
   His condition worsened and Henson returned to New York on
Monday, but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multi-organ
failure, Gelmont said. In response to a reporter's question,
Gelmont said the pneumonia was not AIDS-related.
   Henson's creatures first appeared in 1954, and he watched them
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon
and multimillion-dollar industry.
   His ``Sesame Street'' characters, from Kermit to Oscar the
Grouch to Big Bird, were welcomed into homes around the United
States each morning for the past 21 years. It was too soon to
assess how his death would affect the show, said spokeswoman Mary
Sue Holland.
   ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred Kermit and Miss Piggy and
debuted in 1976, became the most widely seen television program in
the world, attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries. His magic touch was evident again this year with his
work on the box office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's Television
Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   An emotional Lena Horne, who appeared frequently with Henson's
characters over the past 20 years, said she had missed the
puppeteer Tuesday night at a gathering of the ``Sesame Street''
cast and friends. But she had no idea Henson was near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' she said.
   Fred Rogers, host of another children's program, Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, noted Henson's enormous contributions to public
television.
   ``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands
and himself into them,'' Rogers said.
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a friend and
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world,'' Okun said. ``He was a giant in the entertainment
industry. We are also grieving for his wonderful family.''
   Henson married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five
children.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the Walt Disney
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and other animal characters created by Henson into its
theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products.
   Millions of children grew up on ``Sesame Street,'' which is seen
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English to children around the world.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936.

<HEAD>Davis Dies At Home in Beverly Hills</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Davis's business manager Shirley Rhodes told reporters outside
his house in Beverly Hills that he died there ``peacefully in his
sleep'' with his wife, Altovise, and three of his four children
present.
   Frank Sinatra said of Davis:
   ``I wish the world could have known Sam as I did. It was a
generous God who gave him to us for all these years, and a heaven
with his magic gives me warmth.''
   ``Sammy was a little prince who loved everything life had to
offer,'' said Shirley MacLaine, another ``rat-packer.''
   ``I am numb with pain. He was my inspiration. He's the performer
we all strived to live up to. I never saw anyone give so much,''
said Liza Minnelli, who toured with Davis and Sinatra last year.
   ``He gave his heart and soul to every performance and he was a
true American institution. There will never be another one like
Sammy,'' said former President Reagan.
   ``He'll never be replaced and my sympathies go to his wife and
children,'' said Milton Berle, who had known Davis for more than 60
years.
   ``People just couldn't get enough of Sammy. He could do it all _
sing, dance, comedy,'' Bob Hope said.
   Davis, whose hit songs included ``The Candy Man'' and ``I've
Gotta Be Me,'' was born in New York's Harlem on Dec. 8, 1925, and
began dancing at age 1{.
   Over the years, Davis joked that he was the nation's only
``black, one-eyed, Jewish entertainer.'' He converted to Judaism
while recovering from an automobile accident that cost him his left
eye and nearly took his life.
   An actor, singer, dancer and impressionist, the exuberant Davis
lived life hard and fast. His gold chains, heavy rings and gaudy
bracelets were as much a part of his personality as the chain of
cigarettes he smoked.
   His work on stage, screen and television displayed a versatility
matched by few. Though scorned by some as merely a gilded Las Vegas
drone, and criticized by others as being a token of the ``Rat
Pack,'' Davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainer's
entertainer.
   Davis appeared in more than 20 movies and starred in two
Broadway productions _ ``Mr. Wonderful'' and ``Golden Boy.'' He
received a Tony nomination for best actor in a musical for ``Golden
Boy'' in 1965 but lost to Zero Mostel, who won for ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
   His lively, upbeat manner belied a very difficult life. His
career was scarred by vicious racial bigotry. There were endless
taunts, and at one time, he couldn't gamble or rent a room in some
of the Las Vegas hotels at which he played.
   His second marriage, to Swedish actress Mai Britt, was scorned
by some.
   He also faced drug and alcohol abuse and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer, Little Mo. The movie captures
Davis' last dance performance on film, a brief tap routine made
poignant because he had undergone painful hip surgery in 1985 and
received an artificial hip in 1988.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Bourbon Street Club to Turn Down Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French Quarter jazz will be as cool as ever
but somewhat quieter, at least temporarily, now that a judge has
ordered one Bourbon Street club to turn down its volume.
   Civil Court Judge George Connolly on Tuesday told the Famous
Door to turn down its sound to within the limits set by city noise
laws.
   The club's operators, however, don't feel they've broken any
laws, and say they may appeal.
   The decree was sought by the Royal Sonesta Hotel, which filed
suit earlier this month claiming the Famous Door's loud music was a
nuisance that had generated complaints from hotel guests _ more
than 100 since Jan. 1.
   ``We're most pleased,'' Sonesta attorney Mark Van Horn said of
Connolly's order, which remains in effect pending a full trial of
the case.
   To convince Connolly of the need for an immediate order, the
hotel produced noise-level readings taken by an expert on certain
nights in recent months, including some taken in the Sonesta's
second-floor balcony rooms.
   Lois and Louis Karno, who operate the Famous Door, said it's
impossible to accurately measure noise near their club because of
fluctuating amounts of noise coming from crowds in the street and
from other nightclubs nearby _ two of which are operated by the
Royal Sonesta.
   But Connolly sided with the hotel, saying it is possible to
estimate the noise levels fairly and accurately, and that the
hotel's expert had done so.
   The Famous Door violated noise limits for the French Quarter,
and the Sonesta is justified in branding the club's loud music a
nuisance that threatens the hotel's business and reputation,
Connolly said.

<TEXT>
   Runoff presidential elections between novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa and political newcomer Alberto Fujimori will be
held June 10, Peru's Election Council announced Wednesday.
   Recent polls show the centrist Fujimori leading the center-right
Vargas Llosa in this country of 22 million residents by 3 percent
to 8 percent.
   Election Council President Carlos Casteneda made the
announcement Wednesday afternoon, more than five weeks after the
first round of elections.
   Vargas Llosa won 27.6 percent of the vote in the first round and
Fujimori took 24.6 percent. The remainder of the vote was split
between six other contenders.
   The winner of the runoff election will take office July 28,
succeeding President Alan Garcia, who by law cannot run for
re-election.
   The next president must grapple with the worst economic crisis
Peru has faced this century. Inflation is 2,000 percent annually
and the government is nearly bankrupt.
   The winner must also confront the violent Maoist Shining Path
guerrilla group, which controls much of the country's jungle and
mountain regions.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Pneumonia Usually Strikes Very Young or Very Old</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Obit-Henson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pneumonia, a disease that strikes about 2 million Americans each
year, is primarily a hazard of the very young and very old and
rarely kills people who are in otherwise good health.
   Muppet creator Jim Henson, who died unexpectedly Wednesday of
pneumonia at age 53, was an exception to the usual pattern of the
disease.
   While pneumonia causes the deaths of between 40,000 and 70,000
people annually, many are already ill with other serious diseases,
such as heart disease or cancer.
   Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs that is most often
caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacteria that caused
Henson's illness. Many other forms of bacteria, as well as viruses,
can also cause this common illness.
   In Henson's case, doctors said the disease was so advanced when
he reached the hospital that the infection had spread throughout
his body, attacking other organs. At that point, it could not be
controlled with antibiotics, the usual therapy.
   Although pneumonia can strike at any age, infants and the
elderly are often victims. For many it is a mild complication of
the sniffles, but it can also be life threatening, especially if
people's immune defenses are already weakened.
   According to the American Public Health Association, pneumonia
caused by the streptococcus bacteria is fatal in about 20 percent
to 40 percent of victims who already have major underlying diseases.
   Among those who are at especially high risk of pneumonia's
complications are people whose immune systems have been weakened by
diseases or medicines. Pneumonia is a common hazard of people with
AIDS.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, director of intensive care at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York, said AIDS was not a
factor in Henson's death.
   ``Categorically, he did not have AIDS,'' said Gelmont.
   Pneumonia also frequently occurs in people who take
immune-suppressing drugs because of organ transplants, cancer
medicines or steroid drugs for such diseases as rheumatoid
arthritis.

<TEXT>
   The governor of Puerto Rico asked President
Bush Wednesday to stay out of the campaign to make the island the
51st state.
   In a letter to Bush, Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said the
administration was using its influence to promote statehood over
the other two options that also would be offered to the voters if a
referendum takes place as expected next year.
   Colon favors maintaining the island's current commonwealth
status. Congress is working on legislation that would allow the
people of Puerto Rico to vote for statehood, independence or
continued commonwealth status with certain changes.
   Colon's letter was released by Rep. Jaime Fuster, Puerto Rico's
non-voting delegate to Congress, who also wants to maintain the
commonwealth status.
   Last week, Bush wrote to the House Interior subcommittee working
on the bill. He supported the referendum and said he favored
statehood. He also voiced that opinion during his State of the
Union address earlier this year.
   Recent polls in Puerto Rico show statehood leading with 43
percent, compared with 36 percent for commonwealth, 5 percent for
independence and 9 percent undecided.
   In the letter to Bush, the governor said the administration
``has made every conceivable effort'' to:
   _Maximize the alleged attractiveness of statehood.
   _Minimize or ignore its serious fiscal and cultural problems.
   _Oppose all measures porviding greater autonomy under
commonwealth status.
   _Endorse discriminatory treatment in progams for the needy under
a commonwealth.
   A White House spokesman did not immediately return a telephone
call seeking comment.

   Sammy Davis Jr. was a superstar at everything
he did _ singing, acting, dancing, comedy _ and he was a superstar
as a human being, friends recalled after his death Wednesday.
   ``I would say that Sammy Davis Jr. was the greatest entertainer
in show business,'' George Burns said. ``There wasn't anything
Sammy Davis couldn't do. He could sing, he could dance, he was a
mimic, he was an actor, he was a comedian, he did it all.''
   And he did more of it for charitable causes than anybody, said
longtime friend and ``Rat Pack'' member Joey Bishop.
   ``He was a great, great human being. I don't know if he ever
turned down anybody for a good cause,'' Bishop said.
   Davis, 64, died early Wednesday after a long battle with throat
cancer.
   ``I wish the world could have known Sam as I did,'' Frank
Sinatra said from New York. ``Sam never gave less than 100 percent
when he was on stage and he gave even more to those of us lucky
enough to call him friend.''
   ``I think in his 64 years he lived 100 years,'' said another
longtime friend, comedian Milton Berle. ``He loved people and he
loved his work, he loved show business.''
   Berle's voice broke several times as he recounted a friendship
he said dated back at least 60 years.
   ``I'm too overcome with grief to talk about it,'' entertainer
Michael Jackson said through his publicist, Lee Solters.
   Comedian Jerry Lewis wept as he spoke by phone from his Las
Vegas home.
   ``I lost a brother. I lost the dearest friend I've had for 45
years,'' said Lewis, who appeared with Davis when the latter made
his last appearance at Bally's Hotel Casino in Las Vegas on July
12, 1989.
   ``I am numb with pain,'' said entertainer Liza Minnelli who
appeared with Davis and Sinatra in a song-and-dance show billed
``The Ultimate Event.''
   ``As great an entertainer as Sammy was, he was an even greater
friend, not only to me but to anyone whose life he touched,'' said
Dean Martin, who with Davis, Sinatra and Bishop was among
Hollywood's fun-loving and high-living ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s.
   ``Sammy was the type of person who if I were to call him and say
I'm doing a benefit he would drop everything and be there in a
minute,'' said comedian Bob Hope, who said he and Davis had done 30
or 40 television shows and numerous charity benefits together over
the years.
   ``And one thing about Sammy,'' said entertainer Danny Thomas,
``if he told you he was going to help out and then he got an offer
for a job, he absolutely would not cancel the benefit. He would
either not take the job or he'd tell them to wait.''
   Comic-impressionist Rich Little called Davis ``one of the most
talented entertainers in our business.''
   ``While I was able to imitate his voice, his heart can never be
duplicated,'' he said.
   ``Sammy was a little prince who loved everything life had to
offer,'' said actress Shirley MacLaine. ``I'll mostly miss his
generosity. He was always there for whoever needed him.''
   Davis' passing also brought outpourings of sympathy from former
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and civil rights leader
Benjamin L. Hooks.
   ``Sammy had a special talent which made him more than just a
great entertainer _ it made him magical,'' the Reagans said in a
statement.
   ``But he will live in our hearts forever,'' they added. ``We
extend our sympathy and prayers to his family.''
   ``The world has lost not only an irreplaceable talent, but a
humanitarian whose heart was so big, so filled with caring for
others,'' Hooks, the executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement released
by his office in Baltimore.
   Davis, whose talent didn't shield him from bigotry, never let
racism destroy his love of life, Bishop said.
   ``One time we were eating in a restaurant and some guy walked in
and shouted, `Nigger,''' Bishop recalled. ``Sammy jumped up and
looked around and hollered, `Where?' What a wonderful guy he was.''
   ``It would have been fantastic to see him at age 82 still
enjoying performing for the people,'' said comedian Bill Cosby.
``I'll see him later.''
   ``There'll never be anyone like him,'' said singer Lena Horne
from New York City. ``Whenever he appeared with others, he was the
star. Whenever he appeared alone, he was the star.''
   ``It was a generous God who gave him to us for all these years,
and a heaven with his magic gives me warmth,'' said Sinatra. ``He
was a class act and I will miss him forever.''

<HEAD>Ex-ANC Members Say Group Imprisoned and Tortured Them</HEAD>

   Eight former members of the
African National Congress said Wednesday they were among dozens
imprisoned and tortured by the organization while in exile. They
also said the ANC executed several dissidents.
   The allegations of mistreatment at ANC prison camps in Angola
were similar to those made by other ex-ANC members in recent weeks.
   ``We left this country with high ideals of bringing freedom to
our people, however, the years in exile unfortunately have proved
different,'' Mueze Twala, one of the eight, told a news conference.
``The leadership of the ANC, presided over by (President) Oliver
Tambo, has never practiced democracy and has violated human
rights.''
   Twala said he spent almost five years at the ANC's Quatro prison
camp in Angola. He was moved to Tanzania in 1988, then expelled
from the ANC late last year.
   All eight said they were held at the Quatro camp and either were
tortured or witnessed abuses that included beatings with sticks and
pouring boiling water on the heads of prisoners.
   The eight said they were never told why they were detained or
given a hearing.
   The group said dozens of prisoners were held at any given time
at the Quatro camp. They said several prisoners died due to poor
living conditions and seven were executed following a revolt by
dissidents at the ANC's Pango camp in Angola in 1984.
   They said Chris Hani, a leader of ANC's armed wing, presided
over a tribunal that ordered the executions.
   ``We are aware of the names of people now lying in shallow
graves in Africa and we would like to make contact with their
parents or relatives who must demand an explanation from the ANC,''
Twala said. ``We are also concerned about those who are fugitives
from the ANC, suffering in exile and looking for a way to return to
South Africa.''
   The eight, including two women, said that possibly hundreds of
ANC dissidents were either in detention or unaccounted for. The ANC
has an estimated 15,000 members living outside South Africa.
   Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the ANC, recently
acknowledged that ANC security forces tortured some dissidents and
members believed to be agents of the South African government.
   He said the practice was never ANC policy and was halted when
top ANC officials learned of the mistreatment.
   The eight ex-ANC members said they decided to return to South
Africa after President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and other
black opposition groups in February.
   The eight were detained by police when they arrived at the
Johannesburg airport on April 24. All were released Tuesday.
   The government and the ANC held their first ever talks two weeks
ago and are working together to remove obstacles to full
constitutional negotiations.

   Colleagues and friends around the world
remembered Muppet master Jim Henson as a creative genius who
possessed the carefree spirit of a child.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death was announced.
   ``He was our era's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields and
Marx Brothers,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's
Television Workshop, a non-profit educational company that produces
``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend,'' she said. ``Fortunately for the children of the
world, Jim Henson's work will live on.''
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for the Walt Disney Co., which last summer purchased the rights to
use Henson's characters.
   Henson died early Wednesday at New York Hospital of what the
hospital said was ``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated
for at least three days and resulted in multi-organ failure. He was
53.
   ``I'm absolutely gobsmacked,'' said Mark Shivas, who produced
Henson's television series ``The Storyteller,'' and served as
producer to executive producer Henson on the upcoming Anjelica
Huston movie ``The Witches.''
   Shivas, speaking by telephone from the Cannes Film Festival in
France, said Henson was extraordinarily generous.
   ``Even when one had not worked with him for a year, a Christmas
hamper from Harrods would always arrive.''
   ``The medium of television and the world of entertainment will
miss his vision and his gift,'' Brandon Tartikoff, president of
NBC, for which Henson did ``The Storyteller,'' said in a statement.
   NBC said Henson had been developing a four-hour ``Gulliver's
Travels'' special.
   Lena Horne, who crooned ``It's Not Easy Being Green'' with
Henson's alter ego, Kermit the Frog, said she was overwhelmed by
the news.
   She said she was at a party Tuesday night in tribute to ``Sesame
Street's'' late composer, Joe Raposo, and ``the Cookie Monster gave
me a hello from Jim Henson, who said he was so sorry he couldn't be
there.'' Miss Horne said she had no idea he was sick.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' cast member, said, ``Not only
was Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   McGrath made his comments following an unrelated interview
Wednesday morning at CBS radio. He later said the cast was asked
not to speak about Henson's death.
   ``He was so young and there was so much ahead for him to do for
children's media and children's entertainment,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of the Massachusetts-based Action for Children's
Television.
   She said she considered Henson to be a friend and said ``from
the beginning, Jim couldn't do enough for us.''
   ``Ours was the first network exposure he had,'' said country
singer turned sausage maker Jimmy Dean. Henson's irreverent,
piano-playing puppet, Rowlf the dog, was a favorite on Dean's
television show from 1961 to 1963.
   ``Jim always told me the reason he thought Rowlf was so well
accepted was because I treated him like he was real. Jim made him
real. I sometimes wondered whose head was stuffed with sponge
rubber.''
   Fred Rogers, host of ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' said,
``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands and
himself into them. ... His own playful spirit can't help but come
through.''
   Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' said Henson
``never talked down to children, he never degraded children, and
that's why his work was universally accepted.''
   Larry Harmon, better known as Bozo the Clown, said, ``His
passing is a tremendous blow to children of all ages around the
world.''
   Harmon's statement said Henson made his first TV appearance on a
Washington, D.C., production of Harmon's ``Bozo Show,'' whose host
was Willard Scott.
   ``We all knew from the very beginning that he was a true genius
and that God had given him a very special talent,'' said Scott, the
``Today'' show's weatherman.
   ``Jim was not simply the voice of Kermit,'' he added. ``Kermit
was the soul of Jim.''

   Showers and thunderstorms spread across the eastern two-thirds
of the nation Wednesday, with rain scattered from the Rockies to
the East Coast.
   Hail as big as baseballs fell at Sulphur Springs, Texas, the
National Weather Service said. And damage from thunderstorm wind
gusts was reported at Edna, Kan., the agency said.
   By early afternoon, showers and thunderstorms extended from
northeastern Colorado across southern Nebraska, much of Kansas,
Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, northwestern
Louisiana, Arkansas, western Tennessee, western and central
Kentucky, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio,
western and southern New York state, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

   Showers and thunderstorms also were reported across southeastern
Florida.
   Showers were also scattered over south-central North Dakota. In
extreme southwestern North Dakota, winds gusted to nearly 50 mph at
Bowman and Hettinger during the morning.
   Late Tuesday and early Wednesday, severe thunderstorms caused
flooding in parts of Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas and Illinois. In
Oklahoma, a tornado late Tuesday killed one person and injured
eight in Stillwater.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 20 at West

   The IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb blast
Wednesday outside an army recruiting office in north London that
killed an army sergeant and seriously injured another soldier.
   The explosion came just two days after an IRA bomb, buried in a
flowerbed outside an army office in southeast London, blew a hole
in the building and injured seven civilians.
   Scotland Yard said an ``explosive device'' detonated at 5:12
p.m. just after two sergeants got into an unmarked army van parked
behind an army careers information office in Wembley, north London.
A woman civilian clerk waiting to get into the van suffered from
shock but was not injured, police said.
   In a statement released to news organizations Wednesday night in
Dublin, the IRA said: ``A small device containing two pounds of
explosives was planted in the military vehicle outside a British
Army recruiting office which had been under surveillance for some
time.
   ``While the British government persists in its continued
occupation of the north of Ireland, the IRA will persist in
attacking the British government and its forces in England.''
   All three of the victims worked at the recruiting office of the
Territorial Army, Britain's part-time volunteer reserve force.
Scotland Yard said the injured man and the clerk were taken to
Northwick Park Hospital. His condition was believed to be stable.
   The defense ministry identified the dead soldier as Sgt. Charles
Chapman, 34, married with two children.
   Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton visted the injured
sergeant and said the soldier was sitting in the back of the van
when the bomb went. The soldier suffered from cuts, bruises, smoke
inhalation and some damage to his eardrums.
   Charles Baggett, who lives near the center, said on BBC-TV that
he heard ``a very violent explosion'' and ran down the street where
he saw a badly burned man being led away. ``The van itself was just
a tangled mass, quite horrific really,'' he said.
   Hamilton said it was the first time London had seen two bomb
attacks so close together. ``I think we are being subjected to a
campaign of terror by them (the IRA). This is a new situation and
we must assume they will try elsewhere, possibly in the London area
in the near future,'' he said on Channel 4 TV News.
   Speaking before the IRA claim of responsibility was released,
Home Secretary David Waddington said: ``Yet again, we see a
sickening attack by the IRA which can do no good to their cause or
to the name of the Irish people.''
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad, visited the site of the explosion and warned
soldiers and other people involved in Northern Ireland affairs to
check their vehicles.
   The IRA has targeted British military installations in Northern
Ireland, mainland Britain and the rest of Europe in its fight to
unite the Protestant-dominated north with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland in the south.
   On Monday, a time bomb detonated outside the front entrance of
the Directorate of Army Education in the residential area of
Eltham. Three men and three women were treated for minor injuries,
and a 47-year-old man was hospitalized with two broken ribs.
   The IRA claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Heavy Crude Oil Washes Up at Beaches in Southern Britain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy crude oil that leaked from a damaged
Liberian tanker washed up on Britain's southern shore Wednesday,
forcing authorities to close several popular tourist beaches.
   Oil washed up on 12 miles of beaches and coves forming Bigbury
Bay east of Plymouth in far western England. Authorities closed
beaches to permit an unhindered cleanup.
   ``We were fighting a battle against the elements, and the wind
won,'' said Commander John Bywater of the Department of Transport's
Marine Pollution Control Unit. Bywater is supervising teams of
workers equipped with bulldozers and shovels.
   The oil came from the Liberian-registered supertanker Rosebay,
which had been loaded with Iranian crude for Sweden. The vessel was
damaged in a collision with the Devon trawler Dionne Marie on
Saturday in the English Channel.
   About 1,000 tons of oil, or 293,916 gallons, were spilled.
Government officials say half that amount was cleaned up with
air-dropped chemicals and ships that sucked it up from the sea.
   But raw crude and huge patches of oil emulsified into a brown
sludge by the chemicals could be seen drifting to shore. Officials
said the cleanup could take a month to complete.
   Lawmaker Anthony Steen, who represents the area, told the House
of Commons the sludge was 18 inches thick in one cove.
   Steen and others said tankers should have double hulls to
prevent similar spillages.
   Shipping Minister Patrick McLoughlin said the collision was
being investigated.
   He said it was the trawler's duty to give way. He said it had
not altered its course, although the 275,000-ton tanker had taken
evasive action.
   Richard Clark, chief executive of Devon County Council, said the
International Tankers Owners' Pollution Federation, representing
the Rosebay's owners, had agreed to pay for the cleanup. No cost
estimate was given.
   Clark said the blackened areas should be clean before the main
tourist season begins.
   The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the area is
not among Britain's biggest breeding grounds for seabirds.
   However, it said cormorants, kittyhawks, guillemots, shags and
gulls at the marine nature reserve of Wembury Bay were threatened
by the slick.
   Some oil-soaked seabirds have been washed ashore on area
beaches, the society said.

   Dozens of growling bears and chattering
monkeys were paraded by Prime Minister V.P. Singh's home on
Wednesday to protest a government ban on animal street shows.
   Snakes in their baskets were taken on the two-mile march that
caused traffic jams and even some panic, forcing police to
accompany the men and boys who earn their livings performing with
animals and reptiles.
   Police halted the procession a half-mile from Singh's house, a
customary security precaution during the capital's frequent
protests over political and social issues.
   A man dressed as a monkey jumped from tree branch to tree branch
en route and pretended to snatch food from roadside vendors.
Children on their way home from school looked bewildered. Some
clapped, while others peeped from behind trees.
   ``Bread is more important than environment,'' read a placard
hung around the neck of a 12-year-old bear paraded in the midday
103-degree heat.
   ``At least 1 million Indians earn their bread by holding
roadside shows with bears, monkeys, goats, snakes and mongooses,''
said the protest's spokesman and organizer, Dhirendra Pratap.
   ``And you want to stop it. If you do it, they will all die of
hunger,'' he said, referring to both the handlers and their animals.
   On May 1, Minister of State for Environment, Maneka Gandhi,
ordered police to enforce a decade-old law that bans animal shows.
Mrs. Gandhi said many of the animals, especially the bears, die of
mistreatment and heat. The bears are naturally found in the much
cooler Himalayan foothills.
   Mrs. Gandhi, an animal lover, ordered all such animals picked up
and kept in zoos until they can be freed in the forests.
   Officials from her ministry visited several homes of handlers to
try to persuade them to part with their animals but were chased
away, Pratap said.
   In a test case, India's best-known performing bear, Munna, was
taken by police and brought to the city zoo. Munna earned fame
during the 1985 Festival of India in France. The bear was kidnapped
in Paris by an animal activist group and later found in a forest.
   ``At least two dozen policemen came to my house and asked me to
bring Munna to the police station where I was forced to put him in
a cage under threat,'' said Nasir Khan Kalandar, the bear's owner.
   ``Today's march is also to seek freedom for Munna,'' the
75-year-old man said, wiping tears from his eyes.
   Kalandar said Munna did not eat for six days in the zoo. ``He
ate only when my wife visited him the other day.''
   Environment Ministry officials said the decision to take the
bears and other animals stemmed from a desire to prevent cruelty.
   ``The poor things go through a terrible period of so-called
training, and our minister decided to put a stop on that,'' said
one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There are no official statistics on how many bears, monkeys,
snakes and mongooses are in the custody of performers nationwide.
   ``The figure will run into thousands for the animals and tens of
thousands for the snakes,'' said Pratap.
   In New Delhi, 250 bears, 2,000 monkeys, 10,000 snakes and 1,000
mongooses are used for entertainment shows, he said.
   ``These animals are like our sons,'' said Hasan Din, a
performer. ``My family is totally dependent on Moti Bhalu,'' he
said pointing to a 10-year-old sloth bear.
   Pratap asked: ``If Mrs. Gandhi can keep 15 dogs at her home, why
can't these people keep the animals?''
   Mrs. Gandhi runs a hospital and sanctuary for animals on the
outskirts of New Delhi, and her own lawn is usually crowded with
abandoned dogs and orphaned puppies.

<TEXT>
   A pioneering company in
the commercial space industry launched another privately funded
rocket Wednesday, completing experiments that had to be aborted in
a failed flight last year.
   The 52-foot Starfire 1 rocket built by Space Services Inc. of
Houston, whose president is former Mercury astronaut Donald K.
``Deke'' Slayton, blasted off at about 8:40 a.m. to the cheers of
about 100 spectators at the White Sands Missile Range.
   Ten of the 12 experiments carried aloft in the Consort 3 payload
were successfully completed, mission officials said. Mechanical
failures knocked out two experiments.
   ``That's how the launches ought to look,'' said SSI Vice
President Pete Armitage as the rocket shot above the San Andres
Mountains into the cloudless blue sky, leaving behind a thin tail
of white smoke.
   SSI launched the first licensed commercial rocket in March 1989,
essentially inaugurating the commercial space industry in the
United States. Wednesday's $2.5 million flight was sponsored by the
University of Alabama at Huntsville's Consortium for Commercial
Development in Space.
   Sixteen NASA-sponsored consortiums exist in the United States to
develop the commercial space industry. Alabama-Huntsville's
consortium receives about $4 million a year from the National
Aeronautics Space Administration.
   The rocket's payload, dubbed Consort 3, was made up of the same
experiments that flew aboard a rocket launched in November 1989.
That flight, Consort 2, was terminated 30 seconds after takeoff
when the rocket flew off course. The payload survived the flight.
   Officials considered cancelling the Consort 3 flight when they
found problems in the roll resolving gyro, which is part of the
rocket's guidance system. But a half-hour of checks and maneuvering
of the rocket on the launch pad fixed the problem, Armitage said.
   The launch was delayed 10 minutes for the replacement of radar
equipment that failed.
   ``We were scratching our heads pretty hard there for a while
wondering whether we should scrub or not,'' said Slayton.
   The rocket sailed 189.2 miles into space before coasting for
about seven minutes in microgravity, critical for the 12
experiments aboard the rocket. After 15 minutes, the payload
parachuted back to earth 54 miles north of the launch site, and
parts of the booster were recovered by helicopter.
   Scientists were studying their experiments Wednesday afternoon
to determine the microgravity effects.
   Francis Wessling, associate director of the Alabama-Huntsville's
consortium, said the flight was a disappointment for his experiment.
   Wessling was testing whether polyurethane insulation used in
homes _ and which could be used in space station construction _
could be made stronger, lighter or better in space than the
polyurethane insulation produced on Earth.
   The chemicals in his experiment were supposed to form a foam
ball. ``We didn't get a foam ball. We just got a mix of a shiny
liquid that sprayed all over the place,'' he said.
   A brick-like device containing dozens of small vials also didn't
function. The device, called a Materials Dispersion Apparatus, was
supposed to align the vials to mix chemicals, but never moved
during the flight.
   ``We did everything we were supposed to and it didn't work so
we're going to do some testing this afternoon,'' said Jaak
Holemans, manager of commercial space programs for Instrumentation
Technology Associates Inc. ITA is the maker of the Materials
Dispersion Apparatus.
   A similar ITA-manufactured device aboard the rocket worked,
Holemans said. That device will be used for experiments the company
will fly on the Space Shuttle Atlantis in November.
   He said clients who paid $75,000 for vial space on the rocket
flight will have their experiments flown on the next SSI flight.
   Slayton said SSI hopes to launch 12 commercial rockets this year.

   A training session for Asian Games pigeons turned
into target practice for Chinese hunters when several hundred birds
were shot out of the sky.
   The official China Daily said Thursday that 200 carrier pigeons
with Asian Games rings around their legs were found dead recently
in one Beijing suburb.
   An undetermined number were aso either eaten by hunters or sold
on local markets, the daily said. Many more arrived in Beijing with
severe wounds.
   It said investigations found that more than 100 people with
hunting rifles were waiting for the homing pigeons as they passed
overhead on a training flight to Beijing from Shijiazhuang, 185
miles to the southwest.
   The Beijing Homer Association, which owns the birds, has urged
prompt action to protect them from hunters.
   The pigeons are being trained for the Sept. 22 opening of the
Asian Games in Beijing, when more than 60,000 birds are to be
released above the Workers' Stadium.

   Excess water thundered through a dam's floodgates at record
levels Wednesday as a flood crest crossed a Texas reservoir,
flooding subdivisions downstream where 7,000 people were urged to
evacuate.
   Muddy water that devastated Arkansas crops rolled across
thousands of acres of Louisiana farms.
   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer flew over flooded areas to check
damage caused by the Red River. Col. Frank Skidmore of the Army
Corps of Engineers told him 700,000 acres of farms and woods would
be inundated.
   Severe thunderstorms also flooded parts of Missouri,
Mississippi, Kansas and Illinois. In Oklahoma, where flooding was
largely over except around Lake Texoma, a tornado late Tuesday
killed one person and injured eight in Stillwater.
   A 25-year-old cleanup worker drowned when he was swept away by
floodwaters along the Red River in northeast Texas, raising the
state's total of flood-related deaths to 13.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency extended a presidential
disaster area Wednesday to four more Texas counties, bringing the
total to 33 counties eligible for government assistance because of
severe weather and flooding since April 15.
   Roads leading to more than 15 subdivisions along the Trinity
River downstream from Lake Livingston in southeastern Texas were
covered with water. Officials said the Trinity continued to soak up
more land Wednesday as a flood crest crossed the reservoir.
   ``This is the front end of it. This is just the beginning,''
said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County emergency management coordinator.
   The Trinity River Authority released water through the Lake
Livingston Dam's floodgates at a record rate of 94,800 cubic feet
per second, and authorities planned to increase the rate before
Thursday morning.
   A discharge rate of 100,000 cubic feet per second level was
expected by Monday, said Grady Manis, the authority's southern
region manager. He said that level was likely to be sustained for
six to eight days.
   ``Below Lake Livingston Dam, there's about 990 square miles.
Maybe 20 percent of that is probably going to be underwater at the
height of this,'' Manis said.
   Residents who did not heed earlier evacuation advisories and now
want out can call for boat assistance from the county, said Mitchum.
   At the Rattlesnake Ranch in Houston County, part owner and
manager John Merriwether estimates losses in cattle, homes, fences
and property will exceed $1 million.
   ``We lost cattle, but how many cattle, we don't know,'' said
Merriwether, part owner of the 3,700-head ranch about 85 miles
north of Houston. ``Some of these cattle that got in the water,
probably a lot of them are floating now.''
   Agricultural losses also were high in Arkansas.
   Sam Walker of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service said about 281,000 acres of cropland had been affected by
high water, primarily along the Arkansas and Red rivers.
   During the weekend, a quarter of Little River County in
southwest Arkansas was under water.
   ``We had 70,000 acres flooded, including 40,000 acres of row
crops and 25,000 acres of wheat, all gone,'' County Judge Clyde
Wright said. ``We had 18,000 head of cattle in the area. We don't
know how many lived.
   ``I know ranchers who will never recoup their losses from this
flood,'' the judge said.
   On May 1, it was estimated that 1.38 million acres of wheat
would be harvested in Arkansas this year. The flooding could affect
about 13 percent of that total.
   And Ron Chastain, also of the conservation service, said very
little planting is going on because of the wet ground. ``If they
plant later there's a potential lower yield, and greater potential
for the crop failing if they plant real late,'' he said.
   In Louisiana, the Red River crested Tuesday at 34.5 feet at
Shreveport, about 4.5 feet above flood stage, a day early and
nearly a foot below the predicted crest. The difference was
attributed to better water absorption upstream and less than
expected effects from recent rain in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   ``The worst is over, but we're not quite out of the woods yet,''
said Ernest Ethridge, chief meteorologist at the National Weather
Service in Shreveport.
   The water had forced 225 people out of their homes in the
Shreveport-Bossier City area of northwest Louisiana. An additional
135 were flooded out downstream in Rapides, Natchitoches and Red
River parishes.
   In flooding elsewhere, police in Missouri said up to 300 people
were evacuated on Kansas City's East Side during the night after
nearly 7 inches of rain. In nearby Blue Springs, at least 60 homes
were temporarily evacuated after rain threatened to burst the dam
of a private lake.
   Flash flooding in central and southern Illinois forced about 20
families to flee. Five families in Macon County had to be removed
by boat, police said.

   A 40-foot motor home careening
driverless down the street crashed into the home of U.S. Rep. James
Courter, narrowly missing his wife watching TV in the den, police
said Wednesday.
   Courter, R-N.J., was in Washington when the motor home smashed
through his house Tuesday night. His wife, Carmen, escaped injury
as the motor home crashed through a window, tore up carpet and
bashed furniture, police said.
   Courter's two daughters were elsewhere in the house and no
injuries were reported.
   Police are investigating what caused the vehicle to roll down a
hill, through an intersection and across the Courter's front lawn,
pulling down telephone wires to the two-story wood frame home.
   Hackettstown Patrolman Alan Kirkwood said the parking brake was
engaged on the motor home. The vehicle is owned by former Warren
County Freeholder Ken Keyes, said Kevin Kirk, a press aide in the
congressman's Washington office.
   Courter flew home Wednesday, but aides could not reach the home
because the telephone wires remained disconnected.
   Courter was unsuccessful last year in his Republican bid for
governor, losing to Democrat Jim Florio. The congressman has
announced he will not seek re-election this year.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear, disgust and an overriding desire to protect
her children from their father _ an organized crime boss _ drove
Betty Tocco to testify against her husband, she said.
   In an interview published in Wednesday's Chicago Sun-Times, she
called Albert Tocco a ruthless thug who broke the mob's code of
ethics and even cheated his daughter at tic-tac-toe.
   Mrs. Tocco is believed to be the first wife of an organized
crime leader to testify against her spouse.
   Tocco, 61, convicted of running a racketeering and extortion
ring on the South Side of Chicago, was sentenced Monday to 200
years in prison and fined $2 million. It was the stiffest penalty
ever handed to a Chicago mob leader.
   Describing what led her to testify, Mrs. Tocco said until 1986
she believed Tocco's story that he was not a mob boss.
   She learned otherwise when she drove to an Indiana cornfield to
pick up her husband and he told her he had just buried Tony
Spilotro and his brother Michael.
   ``I couldn't believe what I was hearing,'' she said. ``I was
shocked, nauseated, disgusted. It was Father's Day. His sister and
mother were coming over for a barbecue. What was I supposed to say?
`Albert just buried the Spilotros last night so we can't barbecue
today.'''
   She said Tocco was abusive at home and threatened her and her
children. When an unexpected knock came from the front door, she
said her husband made her answer it, especially after a killing
Tocco would later be linked to by federal prosecutors.
   He often told her to pack his bags on a moment's notice, she
said, and he would disappear without telling her where he was going.
   It was during one of those disappearances that FBI agents came
looking for him. Tocco was arrested on Jan. 5, 1989, after his wife
told FBI agents that Albert was trying to get her son, Michael, out
of the country.
   Tocco's conviction and incarceration have done little to ease
her fears, she said.
   A jailhouse informant told authorities Tocco said he'd like to
get his hands ``around her throat.''
   But she believes she did the right thing.
   ``It's not because of me he's where he's at,'' she said. ``I
didn't tell him to go out there and bury people, to go out there
and murder people.''

   An earthquake rocked central Japan Thursday
morning, but its origin was so deep that its surface effects were
mild.
   No damage or injuries were reported, officials said.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the temblor, with a
preliminary reading of 5.7 on the Richter scale, hit at 10:04 a.m.
(9:04 p.m. EDT Wednesday). It originated at a depth of 168 miles in
the northern part of Ishikawa state. Ishikawa lies 185 miles
northwest of Tokyo.
   An earthquake occurring more than 60 miles underground is termed
a deep-focus earthquake, whose shock waves are often blunted before
reaching the surface, according to meteorological officials.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered ``very
strong,'' and one of 6 ``severe,'' capable of widespread damage
near the epicenter.

<HEAD>Former Panamanian President Testifies On Behalf Of Son</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Panamanian president whose son is
on trial for allegedly threatening to kill President Bush testified
Wednesday that presidential death threats are ``the way we express
ourselves'' in Panama.
   ``My life was threatened thousands of times,'' said Demetrio B.
Lakas, who led Panama from 1972-78. ``That's the way we express
ourselves. Saying it and doing it are two different things.''
   Lakas flew here from Panama to testify on behalf of his son,
Otto, on the opening day of his trial in U.S. District Court.
   A local pawnbroker told authorities that Otto Lakas, while
considering buying a pistol last month, said he had ``a bullet with
Bush's name engraved on it'' and would ``blow his (expletive) head
off.''
   Otto Lakas, his family and friends have said the statements were
a joke.
   But Secret Service agents took him at his word. The 21-year-old
Lubbock Christian University architecture student has been jailed
without bond since his arrest April 17.
   If convicted, he faces five years in prison or a $250,000 fine,
or both.
   His attorney, Tommy Turner, told the jury Wednesday that the
government would be unable to prove Lakas ``understood and meant''
what he was saying or that he ``knowingly and willfully intended to
be taken seriously.''
   Prosecutor Paulina Jacobo declined to comment.
   Stacy and Tracy Nichols, twin brothers who manage their parents'
Exect Pawn Shop, said they talked to Otto Lakas April 4 while he
considered buying a .357 Colt revolver.
   Stacy Nichols said Lakas said the gun would be for his own
protection.
   While discussing ``everything that 21-year-olds talk about,''
Stacy Nichols testified Wednesday, Lakas voiced anger about the
December invasion of Panama by U.S. troops, for which he blamed
Bush.
   ``I have a .223-caliber rifle at home and a bullet with Bush's
name engraved on it,'' Stacy Nichols, in a Secret Service
affidavit, quoted Lakas as saying. ``Bush is coming to Lubbock and
I will blow his (expletive) head off.''
   Stacy Nichols was quoted in an April 17 Secret Service affidavit
as saying he was afraid to tell authorities of Lakas' statements
for fear of retaliation.
   But he testified Wednesday that Lakas' alleged threats were the
only serious part of a three-hour conversation filled with jokes.
   Nichols said he was never concerned for his own safety while
Lakas was in the shop, and that he would have sold Lakas the gun if
he produced the money.
   Nichols also said the incident was reported only because the
brothers mentioned it to a friend who is a police officer, who told
the Secret Service.
   The Nichols brothers and John Steven Barker, the Secret Service
agent who arrested Lakas, are the government's only witnesses in
the case.
   Barker said a search of Lakas' apartment produced a .30-.30
caliber rifle and a box of bullets, none of which was engraved with
Bush's name.
   The trial is expected to end this week.

   Talks on the future of U.S. bases in
the Philippines hit a stumbling block Wednesday when the Filipinos
claimed that Washington owned $222 million in promised aid.
   Two key Philippine senators said even if the sides reached an
agreement on the bases, they doubted it would win the necessary
Senate approval.
   Philippine delegates to the talks said the U.S. debt could
jeopardize prospects for extending the lease on the six bases,
which expires Sept. 16, 1991. But the chief U.S. delegate was
quoted as saying he would not ``stand next to a cash register''
while trying to settle the question.
   President Bush said in Washington that he was studying
alternative locations for U.S. bases in case the negotiations fail.
   ``If we are not wanted there, we are not going to be there,''
Bush said at a news conference. ``It's not something absolutely
essential for the United States.''
   The two sides called off an afternoon negotiating session to
attend a memorial service at Clark Air Base for two U.S. airmen
slain Sunday, the eve of the talks' opening.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for killing airmen John
H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and James C. Green, 20, of
Craig, Colo., and threatened more attacks until all ``American
occupational troops'' left the country.
   In a message read at the ceremony, Bush promised the deaths
would not deter the United States from ``the cause of freedom.''
   ``Terrorism will not deflect our nation from its purpose, to
preserve and protect democracy and freedom,'' the message said.
   The killings prompted a tightening of security by military and
civil aviation officials.
   The manager of Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport,
Eduardo Carrascoso, said the staff assigned to check planes owned
by U.S. carriers or bound for the United States had been doubled,
and that scrutiny of cargo would include the use of bomb-sniffing
dogs.
   United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines
operate in the country. Philippine Airlines also flies from Manila
to Hawaii and California.
   Restrictions were also tightened further for the 40,000 troops,
Defense Department civilian employees and military dependents,
sources in the U.S. military community said.
   At Clark Air Base, airmen formerly housed in civilian hotels
were brought back to the base. Sailors and Marines who had been
living off-post were ordered back to barracks at Subic, the sources
said.
   In Manila, meanwhile, police turned back more than 300 people,
including Roman Catholic nuns, who tried to march to the U.S.
Embassy to protest the six bases. Police said 15 people were
arrested.
   During Wednesday's talks, the Philippine panel charged that the
United States had fallen behind by $222.6 million in aid promised
in return for use of the facilities. U.S. officials put the
shortfall at $96 million.
   The two sides agreed to appoint a committee to study the matter,
but the U.S. response was chilly. U.S. spokesman Stanley Schrager
quoted Richard Armitage, the chief U.S. delegate, as saying he does
not ``stand next to a cash register when conducting foreign
relation.''
   U.S. officials said Armitage would leave the Philippines on
Friday, when the first phase of talks is scheduled to end. They
said he would return if the two sides decide to continue the talks.
   The current talks are considered exploratory, to determine
whether the two governments will begin formal negotiations on a new
agreement. Officials have said this first phase of talks could be
extended beyond Friday.
   Even if an agreement is reached, two Philippine senators
expressed doubts it would win the needed ratification. Sen. Leticia
Ramos-Shahani, chairwoman of the Senate foreign relations
committee, and Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the chamber's
defense committee, said they did not believe lawmakers would
approve a pact.
   U.S. officials say if no agreement can be reached, the bases
will be closed.
   In Canberra, Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawk said his country
would not allow the United States to base nuclear weapons in its
territory if the bases in the Philippines were closed.
   The issue was raised by a report of a study by the Rand Corp.,
an American think tank, which said Australia was a possible option
if the United States had to leave the Philippines.
   As a matter of policy, the Pentagon does not say whether U.S.
vessels carry nuclear weapons.

   Puppeteer extraordinaire Jim Henson, who gave
his voice to Kermit the Frog and his elfin spirit to a multitude of
Muppets as they taught and delighted millions worldwide, died
unexpectedly Wednesday. He was 53.
   Henson, who lived in Manhattan, died at 1:30 a.m. of
complications from pneumonia, said a statement issued by New York
Hospital. Henson had been admitted to the hospital early Tuesday
with ``galloping pneumonia'' untreated for at least three days, the
hospital said.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills said.
   Henson's creatures first appeared in 1954, and he watched them
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon
and multimillion-dollar industry.
   His ``Sesame Street'' characters, from Kermit to Oscar the
Grouch to Big Bird, were welcomed into homes around the United
States each morning for the past 21 years. It was too soon to
assess how his death would affect the show, said spokeswoman Mary
Sue Holland.
   ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred Kermit and Miss Piggy and
debuted in 1976, became the most widely seen television program in
the world, attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries. His magic touch was evident again this year with his
work on the box office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's Television
Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   An emotional Lena Horne, who appeared frequently with Henson's
characters over the past 20 years, said she had missed the
puppeteer Tuesday night at a gathering of the ``Sesame Street''
cast and friends. But she had no idea Henson was near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' she said. ``We just can't
afford to keep losing our great people.''
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a friend and
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world,'' Okun said. ``He was a giant in the entertainment
industry. We are also grieving for his wonderful family.''
   Henson married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five
children.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the Walt Disney
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and other animal characters created by Henson into its
theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products.
   Henson created the Muppets 36 years ago, but they became
immensely popular after their debut in 1969 on ``Sesame Street.''
Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, Ernie and Grover delighted parents
while instructing their children.
   While Miss Piggy was modeled after Mae West, his characters had
star appeal that attracted diverse performers, such as opera singer
Placido Domingo and actor Danny DeVito. Characters such as ``Meryl
Sheep'' were named after celebrities.
   ``Puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon
characters have,'' Henson said in a 1986 interview. ``I'm sure
Kermit will stay younger a lot longer than I will.''
   Henson's work with the Muppets earned him many awards, including
a Peabody for excellence in television programming and a Grammy for
a Muppet album. His Saturday morning cartoon show, ``The Muppet
Babies,'' won four consecutive Emmys for outstanding animated
program.
   Henson admitted the word ``muppet'' was something he just made
up, although to appease interviewers he would say it was a
combination of ``marionette'' and ``puppet.'' In addition to
Kermit, he did the voices of Ernie and game show host Guy Smiley.
   Millions of children grew up on ``Sesame Street,'' which is seen
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English to children around the world. Although the program was
initially intended to assist inner-city children, its popularity
far transcended that.
   Henson educated adults as well. ``Not only was Jim a good friend
for 20 years, he was the person who taught me more than anyone
else,'' said Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' regular for two
decades.
   Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' said Henson
``never talked down to children, he never degraded children, and
that's why his work was universally accepted.''
   ``His contribution was not just to children's TV,'' Keeshan
added. ``Jim's work really was universal and appreciated by adults
as much as children.''
   Fred Rogers, host of another children's program, Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, noted Henson's enormous contributions to public
television.
   ``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands
and himself into them,'' Rogers said.
   Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, a
lobbying group, said, ``I can hardly believe it. He was so young
and there was so much ahead for him to do.''
   Henson's death was the third to strike Sesame Street in the last
year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the popular
children's series, died last year at age 52. A televised tribute to
Raposo was scheduled for Wednesday night. Former cast member
Northern Calloway, who played David, also died recently.
   First lady Barbara Bush, who recently appeared on ``Sesame
Street'' to promote her literacy campaign, released a statement
saying:
   ``Mr. Henson's pioneering contribution through the educational
and entertaining Sesame Street and Muppets characters was unique in
the history of television.
   ``His dedication to wholesome children's programming has
enlivened the minds of young and old alike. Mr. Henson's
originality and creativity will influence entertainers, educators
and, most important of all, children for generations to come.''
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at the hospital, said
Henson apparently came down with the flu on Friday in North
Carolina, and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the
pneumonia.
   His condition worsened and Henson returned to New York on
Monday, but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multi-organ
failure, Gelmont said. In response to a reporter's question,
Gelmont said the pneumonia was ``categorically'' not AIDS-related.
   Asked why Henson might have allowed his health to deteriorate
for several days without seeking further help, Susan Berry, a
publicist for Jim Henson Productions, replied:
   ``My guess is he was totally absorbed, he couldn't be bothered.
He was very cavalier with his health. I've known him for five
years, and I think he was sick twice during that time.''
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936.
   The Muppets first appeared on a local Washington, D.C.,
television program ``Sam and Friends.'' Kermit made his debut on
the show, which won a local Emmy in 1959.
   During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe appeared regularly on
``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' Rowlf, a
talking dog, frequently carried on conversations with Dean.
   Things broke wide open for Henson when his characters appeared
on ``Sesame Street'' in 1969. He introduced ``The Muppet Show'' in
1976, and it captured three Emmys during its five-year syndicated
run.
   The Muppets also appeared in the first year of ``Saturday Night
Live'' in 1975. The creations for that show included the idol-like
Mighty Fuvog.
   His recent television work included ``The Ghost of Faffner
Hall'' on HBO and ``Fraggle Rock'' for cable TV. He won another
Emmy for ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' a special on NBC.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie,'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' in 1981 and
the 1984, ``The Muppets Take Manhattan,'' which ended with the
marriage of Kermit and Miss Piggy.
   Henson also directed the fantasy films ``The Dark Crystal'' in
1982 and ``Labyrinth'' in 1986. He co-directed the former with
Frank Oz, the voice of Miss Piggy.
   His family said plans for a memorial service will be announced
later.

   Guards surrounded government buildings in the
secessionist republic of Estonia today after Soviet loyalists
converged on parliament in what the premier called a failed ``coup
attempt.''
   Lawmakers in neighboring Lithuania, meanwhile, were to begin a
closed-door debate on new proposals designed to end an impasse with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet president has proclaimed Baltic
independence declarations illegal and imposed sanctions against
Lithuania.
   Calm was reported following disturbances in Estonia and Latvia
as Secretary of State James A. Baker III prepared for a round of
meetings today with Soviet officials in Moscow.
   As part of Lithuania's effort to find a diplomatic solution,
President Vytautas Landsbergis on Tuesday appealed to President
Bush and Gorbachev to discuss Baltic independence at their summit
in Washington at the end of the month.

   Tests commonly used to check for the AIDS
virus may fail to detect many people who actually are infected, a
study suggested today.
   Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta tested the blood of
165 people who had tested negative for the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, and found that 30 actually were
infected with the virus.
   Dr. Tab Ansari, the Emory professor who supervised the study,
said Tuesday that his team used a new type of test to find HIV
antibodies in blood samples that the routine laboratory tests had
said were disease-free.
   ``All of the ones that they found positive, we found positive in
our assay,'' said Ansari. ``But in addition, there were quite a few
that were negative in their assay that were picked up as positive

   Pennsylvania voters set the stage for an unusual governor's race
between an anti-abortion Democrat _ Gov. Robert P. Casey _ and a
pro-choice Republican. In Nebraska, three Democrats were locked in
a tight race to challenge Gov. Kay Orr, who won the GOP primary
handily.
   In the Oregon governor's campaign, Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer dominated Tuesday's GOP primary and advanced to a
November general election against Democratic Secretary of State
Barbara Roberts, who had no primary opposition. The Democratic
incumbent, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, is retiring.
   U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon breezed past a single
Republican challenger to win nomination for a fifth term. His
November challenger, businessman Harry Lonsdale, overwhelmed a
six-candidate Democratic field.
   Two-term Democratic Sen. James Exon of Nebraska had no primary
opposition, and former Republican Rep. Hal Daub easily won the
nomination to challenge him.

   A pro-Sandinista strike virtually
paralyzed public services in the capital today, putting staggering
pressures on the 3-week-old government of Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   Nicaraguan and U.S. government officials accused the once-ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front of trying to undermine the
conservative administration, a charge no Sandinista official has
denied publicly so far.
   Sonia Ortiz, a labor leader, said the strikers want a 200
percent pay raise, a subsidized food package, rehiring of a labor
leader fired Monday, and the demobilization of the Contra rebels.
   ``Lady Violeta has no idea what organized Sandinista workers
are,'' she said.

   Vincent van Gogh's melancholy portrait of the
doctor who treated him in the weeks before his suicide sod at
auction for $82.5 million, making it by far the most expensive
painting in the world.
   The sale Tuesday of ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' came after a
10-minute bidding war at Christie's auction house between two
buyers who jacked up the price in increments of $1 million.
   The 26-by-22.5-inch oil was worth $141,000 per square inch to
Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo, which has emerged in recent years as a
major buyer of Impressionist art.
   The total surpassed the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's
``Irises'' in 1987 at Sotheby's, said Susan Britman, a Christie's
spokeswoman.

   An engineering society thinks it's time the
world arms itself against asteroids that might collide with Earth.
   Nuclear warheads, suggests the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, may be needed to protect the planet against
mountain-sized space boulders that might smash into the Earth at
46,000 miles an hour.
   ``We have the technology needed to detect and track such an
object and possibly to divert it from an impending impact,'' the
AIAA said. ``We would be derelict if we did nothing.''
   In a position paper, the society suggested that searches of the
heavens be increased, perhaps by spotting relatively inexpensive
telescopes around the globe. It also called for a study of ways to
``deflect or destroy, or significantly alter the orbits of,
asteroids predicted to impact the Earth.''

   A steep hike in health care costs was a major
contributor to a modest rise in inflation last month, the
government said Wednesday
   Overall, consumers received their first break since a cold snap
sent prices soaring at the beginning of the year. But that news was
tempered by the fact that health care costs skyrocketed 0.8 percent
in April. It was the third increase at that level, according to the
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index.
   Health care costs were up 8.9 percent from a year ago.
   The government said declines in the cost of vegetables, fuel oil
and women's clothing offset the higher healthcare costs to restrain
the overall increase. The rise in the Consumer Price Index was held
to a seasonally adjuted 0.2 percent in April, the most modest gain
in seven months.

   Britain's unelected House of Lords is preparing to
kill government legislation to allow trials of suspected Nazi war
criminals.
   It would be the first time in modern history that the Lords,
mostly hereditary aristocrats, have rejected outright a bill passed
by the elected House of Commons.
   Nazi hunters are distressed, but some in the Lords argue that
fair trials are impossible at a distance of up to 50 years, that
the crimes were not committed on British soil, and that retroactive
legislation is unjust.
   The expected rejection of the bill, in a Lords vote on June 4,
has revived qualms about the powers still vested in this unique
collection of blue-bloods, bishops, jurists and recently ennobled
politicians, all of whom owe their place in the upper chamber to
birth or political patronage.

   The presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America has rebuked retired Swedish Bishop Krister
Stendahl for supporting the irregular ordination of three
homosexuals into the church's ministry.
   In a letter, Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom chided Stendahl for
identifying himself in the matter as ``bishop emeritus'' of
Stockholm, and said:
   ``It is inappropriate and confusing for you to employ your
status in the Church of Sweden to lend credence to an unapproved
action in the ELCA.''
   Stendahl, a Lutheran and retired bishop of Stockholm who now is
chaplain at Harvard Divinity School where he formerly was dean, had
said the ordinations in San Francisco last January ``stood well
before God.''
   Denominational leaders have instituted disciplinary procedings.
Chilstrom criticized Stendahl for ``involvement in the affairs of
another church.''
   The ELCA forbids ordination of homosexuals unless they agree to
live celibate lifestyles. Stendahl had contended it is ``pastorally
questionable'' to make celibacy a condition for ministry in the
Lutheran tradition.

to support societal goals,'' the letter says. ``We need to do so

and its evangelical counterpart, the National Association of
Evangelicals, Mormons, Southern Baptists and several other
Protestant denominations. Their membership totals more than 60
million.
   Saying that the excise tax on wine and beer has not been raised
since 1951, the letter cites a report by former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop that increasing the tax 25 cents on a can of beer and
$1.47 per bottle of wine would bring in $20.6 billion in new
revenue.

<HEAD>Catholic Schools Found Producing More Socially Concerned Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic high schools, once taught mainly
by nuns and religious brothers but now staffed mainly by lay
teachers, still are making a special impact on students.
   A study finds they're more concerned for others and more
critical of militarism than public school students. However,
Catholic students are less enthusiastic about school, perhaps
because it's tougher.
   These are among findings of a comparative analysis done by a
research center, the Search Institute of Minneapolis, of an annual
government survey of 16,000 high school seniors.
   The examination of effects of schools on student values, beliefs
and behaviors, commissioned by the National Catholic Educational
Association, turned up these conclusions:
   _ That seniors in Catholic schools have stronger pro-marriage
attitudes and indicate more concern for others, including greater
wilingness to contribute money to help them, than do their public
school counterparts.
   _ That the Catholic students are less supportive of military
programs than public school students, suggesting a shift in
Catholic thinking which once was most solidly supportive of the
military.
   _ That Catholic seniors, in terms of faith and church
dedication, are more religious than public school students, as
measured by church attendance, contributions and degree of
importance attached to religion.
   _ That paradoxically, while the Catholic seniors are more
consistently determined to get a college education, they have a
less positive attitude toward school now than do public school
students.
   The researchers suggested that the Catholic students' edginess
about their present school experience is because of its more
rigorous academic demands.
   Of the overall results, Michael Guerra, executive director of
the NCEA's secondary schools department, said the ``evidence
clearly demonstrates that Catholic schools succeed in touching the
hearts of their students.''
   He said other influences than the school may contribute to the
differences, observing:
   ``Unlike its public school counterpart, the Catholic high school
is part of a larger setting in which strength is drawn from a
common moral lnaguage, a common history and a shared vision of the
human journey.''
   The study also turned up differences in family and personal
background between students in schools run and paid for by the
church, and students in government-run public schools, paid for by
taxes.
   Catholic seniors were more likely to have grown up in larger
urban communities and their parents generally have higher education
than was the case for public school students.
   Also the Catholic students had fewer nights out and fewer hours
working on jobs during the average school week than did the public
school students. Catholic students also were more likely to live in
a two-parent home.
   A special finding on a point of wide concern was that the
beliefs, values and behaviors of the current Catholic seniors are
about the same as held by their precursor classes in past years.
   ``There has been a great concern about the decline in moral
values and visions of the nation's youth during this past decade,''
Guerra said, adding:
   ``This study shows that, in general, recent Catholic high school
graduates have reported beliefs, vaules and behaviors consonant
with purposes of Catholic schools and consistent with their
predecessors 10 years ago.''
   He said ``school climate, parental involvement, teacher
commitment and strong school leadership may have an even greater
impact on formation of student values than they do on academic
achievement.''
   Sister Catherine T. McNamee, NCEA president, noting that the
organization's theme for this year is ``Catholic Education:
Transforming Our World,'' said:
   ``What more dramatic way to transform the world than to graduate
students who bring to society the strong beliefs and values
instilled in them by Catholic secondary schools.''

<HEAD>Political Fireworks Over Flag Burning</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grand old flag issue is back, just in time
for the political fireworks season. It will ignite some, no matter
which way the Supreme Court rules on the law against flag burning.
   Overturn it and Congress will quickly consider, and almost
certainly approve, a constitutional amendment to ban burning the
American flag. Just as certainly the showoffs who helped generate
the issue in the first place will show up again with flags and
matches.
   There aren't many of them, and not many flags would be burned.
Enough to fuel the Independence Day political oratory, though, and
to help put the whole matter into the middle of the congressional
and state election campaigns.
   With the law upheld and a jail term threatening, there would be
fewer flag burnings or defacings, but the same handful of
demonstrators would set about finding other ways to make themselves
offensive. And they probably would succeed.
   But with a big difference. If the court upholds the statute,
they will be a brief sideshow. Should the law be overturned, they
will get a new round of national attention, while Congress begins
the process of trying to write a ban on flag burning into the
Constitution.
   The more effective way to get flag burning off the agenda would
be to ignore the people who do it, since there aren't many of them,
and they wouldn't bother if nobody paid attention. But that seems a
political impossibility.
   The flag burning episode that caused the whole controversy dates
from the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. It went
largely unnoticed for five years, until the court overturned the
conviction of the demonstrator involved.
   That produced the issue overnight. With the issue came the
demonstrators, who tend to vanish if ignored, then the new law.
   The Flag Protection Act of 1989 makes it a crime punishable by
up to a year in prison to burn, mutilate, deface or trample a flag.
It was passed in an effort to overturn by statute the Supreme
Court's reversal of a Texas law against flag burning. The court
held that law violated the First Amendment guarantee to freedom of
speech.
   President Bush wanted a constitutional amendment adopted then,
on grounds that an act of Congress couldn't reverse the court
ruling and protect the flag from burning. But Democrats pushed the
law instead of an amendment, and Bush let it take effect without
his signature.
   The overturned Texas law banned the burning or defacing of the
flag as an act of contempt that would seriously offend others. The
new federal law doesn't mention motives, it simply bans the
desecration of the flag. As soon as it was enacted it was
challenged by demonstrators who burned flags on the steps of the
Capitol and outside a federal court in Seattle.
   Federal judges in both cities held the law unconstitutional. The
Supreme Court then took it up on a fast track, heard arguments on
Monday, and will issue its decision before recessing for the summer.
   Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley has promised he will put a
constitutional amendment on flag burning up to a vote within 30
days if the court overturns the statute. He also said he would vote
no because there should be no tinkering with the Bill of Rights.
Such an amendment would be the first change in the First Amendment
since it was adopted 199 years ago.
   It would take a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress to
approve an amendment and send it to the states for ratification.
Three-quarters of them, or 38, would be needed in order to make it
part of the Constitution.
   The amendment Bush was pushing came to a vote in the Senate last
year. It got 51 votes, 16 short of an absolute two-thirds margin.
But some senators who voted against it said they would support an
amendment should the statute be overturned. And majorities in both
parties probably would line up that way.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York warned of the political risks in a
brief submitted to the court, saying that reversal ``would almost
certainly trigger a divisive battle in Congress and in the states''
over amending the Constitution.
   The safe vote would be for patriotism and the flag, especially
in an election year. The ratification process would take a lot
longer, and every time a state legislature dealt with it, the tiny
fraternity of flag burners could emerge to inflame the issue.

<TEXT>
   U.S. bombers destroyed the
young girl's home, and she avidly practiced target shooting in case
Americans, those ``monster-like people who would not even smile at
children,'' invaded her homeland of North Vietnam.
   Two decades later, Nguyen Hanh appears regularly on America's
Cable News Network, hopes to hone her skills in the United States _
and says she bears no hard feelings about the past.
   The 29-year-old newswoman is one of four employees of state-run
Vietnam Television who contribute almost every week to CNN's
``World Report,'' which presents reports from local correspondents
around the world without comment or editing.
   An agreement _ worked out in the face of U.S. government
opposition _ provides Vietnam Television with the CNN service while
the American cable network gets reporting from Mrs. Hanh and her
colleagues.
   CNN charges a token 50 Vietnamese dong a year, less than a U.S.
penny, for its service, and has thrown in free a satellite
receiving dish to be installed in Hanoi by mid-June.
   The program's stress on foreign media doing things its own way
can make it difficult to evaluate reporting content, said Stuart
Loory, a CNN vice president who oversees ``World Report.'' But he
said the Vietnamese input has improved technically ``1,000
percent.'' He also praised Mrs. Hanh.
   ``She is one of those who has been working very hard to
interpret her country to the rest of the world,'' Loory said in a
telephone interview from CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
   Mrs. Hanh's coverage for CNN _ normally two- or three-minute
spots _ has included private enterprise in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam's attempts to attract foreign tourists, and a recent return
by Hanoi of remains of Americans missing in action.
   She said her early connections with America were not happy ones.
   On Dec. 26, 1972, her home in Hanoi was destroyed when former
President Nixon ordered the ``Christmas bombings'' to pressure
Vietnam into agreeing to peace terms.
   ``When I was small, I thought Americans were terrible,
monster-like people who would not even smile at children,'' she
said. She remembered scoring 29 out of 30 points in target practice
designed to prepare everyone for possible American attacks.
   Mrs. Hanh, whose husband is a sports reporter for Vietnam
Television, graduated in English from Hanoi's Foreign Language
Teachers Training College and later took courses in journalism. She
hopes she can attend a training course in Atlanta that CNN offers
some ``World Report'' contributors.
   ``Sometimes CNN suggests stories, but it's not always possible
to do them,'' Mrs. Hanh said. ``We try to think up things that will
make foreigners understand Vietnam better.''
   Mrs. Hanh said Vietnam Television wanted to put the country's
best face forward to international audiences, and suggested more
leeway was allowed in critical and investigative reporting for
domestic consumption.
   Unfettering communist Vietnam's guarded media was one argument
used by the Turner Broadcasting System, which owns CNN, in its
battle with the U.S. government, which initially said the network's
dealings violated a tough U.S. trade embargo with Vietnam.
   But the U.S. Congress in 1988 amended the embargo to exempt
information materials and when the government finally backed down
last January, an administration official noted ``the importance of
having U.S. news programs in Vietnam.''
   It still is unclear, however, what, if any, censorship Vietnam
Television will exercise in disseminating the CNN service within
the country.
   After some reportedly difficult dealings with the Vietnamese,
CNN owner Ted Turner met with Vietnam Television executives two
years ago and agreement was quickly reached. CNN currently has
similar cooperative arrangements with 150 organizations in 120
countries or other entities.
   ``Ted Turner believes strongly in the free flow of information
and sees this exchange as helping to bring Vietnam back into the
world of nations,'' Loory said.

<HEAD>As Always, Health Care Costs Lead the Inflation Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   April food prices, especially for vegetables,
were lower than in March. Fuel oil prices fell. Women's apparel
prices, which had soared a month earlier, retreated sharply.
   But health care costs soared.
   For the third straight month they rose 0.8 percent, a rate that
if maintained would mean about 10 percent inflation this year in
this one category.
   It's an old problem, an alarming one, a worsening one, and one
that isn't likely to be resolved without bitter debate about who
should live and who should die, and perhaps a demand that Americans
shape up or lose jobs.
   Victor R. Fuchs, a health economist, observes that in the period
1947-1987 health care spending grew 2.5 percent faster per year
than other spending, and that it now consumes more than 11 percent
of the gross national product.
   That percentage compares with just 5 percent of GNP in 1947. It
comes at the expense of other areas of the economy, at the expense
of housing and education, for example. It robs funds from
environmental improvement.
   If trends continue, says Fuchs, a Stanford University health
economist, the percentage will reach 20 in a few decades. Right
now, he says, ``There is little prospect to substantially alter
this trend.''
   The problem has myriad causes, judging from the vast number
typically named by specialists in the field. Among them:
   High labor costs without increases in productivity, poor
hospital management, technological innovation, aging population,
poor health habits, third-party payments that remove patient
incentives to save.
   Fuchs, who is also a researcher at the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., observes that health care
wages have risen more rapidly than those of other workers, while
productivity gains have been slower.
   His figures show that net incomes of physicians rose about 8
percent a year in 1977-1987, while the wages of private,
non-agricultural workers rose about 5.5 percent a year.
   Many businesses are attacking the rising cost to them by
requiring workers to fund more of the bill for health insurance.
   A survey of 1,900 companies by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co., a
benefits consultant, showed 45 percent require contributions for
individual coverage vs. 39 percent in 1988.
   The same survey showed that individual deductibles, once
commonly placed at $100, are now often at $300, and that 72 percent
of employers require employees to pay some portion of hospital
charges, compared with 66 percent in 1988.
   Some smaller companies are putting their workers on the payrolls
of employee leasing companies, whose large number of workers allow
them to obtain lower health insurance rates and lower costs for
other benefits as well.
   Barry Kerr, director of Employee Leasing of New York, Inc.,
claims that ``our typical client reduces his medical insurances
costs anywere from 20 percent to 35 percent when we take over the
payroll.''
   Larger companies, and insurers too, also are becoming more aware
of the need to emphasize preventive medicine, to teach better
health habits, to convince employees to change destructive
lifestyles.
   A health and fitness survey of 2,000 employees at Steelcase
Inc., a Michigan manufacturing company, found that just 10 percent
of the employees accounted for 66 percent of the company's health
care costs.
   The study, conducted by the University of Michigan Fitness
Research Center, found that many of the worker's health problems
involved smoking, alcohol, drugs, high-fat diets, lack of exercise
and uncontrolled high blood pressure.
   More than half of all chronic diseases, including cancer and
heart disease, said the center's director, Professor D.W. Edington,
are related to lifestyle. It is a rare company, nevertheless, that
offers incentives to better lifestyles.
   Without some fundamental change, it is obvious that health care
costs will eat like a cancer into other areas of the economy,
devouring funds once aimed at improving environment, child care,
housing, education and social issues.
   The Michigan findings provoked Edington to make this comment:
   ``We are swiftly moving into an era of increasing conflict
between two prized American values _ access to health care and the
freedom to choose how we live. Something has to give.''

   Leaders of eight national religious bodies,
including some that rarely work together, have backed a proposed
increase in the federal excise tax on alcoholic beverages.
   In a letter to members of Congress, they said such an increase
could discourage alcohol consumption and raise revenues to help
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``Historically, our nation has used excise taxes as a mechanism
to support societal goals,'' the letter says. ``We need to do so
again to curb the terrible toll alcohol is taking.''
   Signers included officials of the National Council of Churches
and its evangelical counterpart, the National Association of
Evangelicals, and of the Mormons, Southern Baptists and several
other Protestant denominations. Their membership totals more than
60 million.
   Saying that the excise tax on wine and beer has not been raised
since 1951, the letter cites a report by former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop that increasing the tax 25 cents on a can of beer and
$1.47 per bottle of wine would bring in $20.6 billion in new
revenue.

   The presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America has rebuked retired Swedish Bishop Krister
Stendahl for supporting the irregular ordination of three
homosexuals into the church's ministry.
   In a letter, Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom chided Stendahl for
identifying himself in the matter as ``bishop emeritus'' of
Stockholm, and said: ``It is inappropriate and confusing for you to
employ your status in the Church of Sweden to lend credence to an
unapproved action in the ELCA.''
   Stendahl, a Lutheran and retired bishop of Stockholm who now is
chaplain at Harvard Divinity School where he formerly was dean, had
said the ordinations in San Francisco last January ``stood well
before God.''
   Denominational leaders have instituted disciplinary procedings.
Chilstrom criticized Stendahl for ``involvement in the affairs of
another church.''
   The ELCA forbids ordination of homosexuals unless they agree to
live celibate lifestyles. Stendahl had contended it is ``pastorally
questionable'' to make celibacy a condition for ministry in the
Lutheran tradition.

   The hapless Brooklyn Dodgers always could wait
till next year, but there's only one year for the long-suffering
House Republicans: 1992.
   The GOP, now outnumbered 257-176, foresees a convergence of
political fortunes that could wrest control of the House from the
Democrats in the 1992 elections. They've been marshalling all their
hope, money and energy to that endoing to be a unique opportunity,'' said
House Minority
Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill. ``If it doesn'.
   ``It is gt happen this time, a lot
of our members are going to feel like, well, Judas Priest, what is
the use?''
   Frustrated is the term most frequently used to describe the
minority party in the House. Frustrated and hungry.
   ``Dealing with the frustration is one of the most serious
issues,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the
House Republican Conference. ``You can't have over time a
substantial number of your members throwing up their hands. You
continually have to work on it.''
   Republicans last held a majority when President Eisenhower was
in his first term and the Dodgers still were in Brooklyn. Through
the 1960s and 1970s, the words ``Democratic'' and ``Congress''
seemed forever mated.
   t works and everybody hugs everybody else.
   Except for the last part, that's a scenario being proposed by
the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Although
asteroid orbits rarely intersect Earth's, the AIAA thinks we should
be ready for one that might.
   ``We have the technology needed to detect and track such an
object and possibly to divert it from an impending impact,'' the
AIAA said. ``We would be derelict if we did nothing.''
   In a position paper, the institute suggested that searches of
the heavens be increased, perhaps by spotting relatively
inexpensive telescopes around the globe. It also called for a study
of ways to ``deflect or destroy, or significantly alter the orbits
of, asteroids predicted to impact the Earth.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle referred to the position paper and a
longstanding theory that asteroids could be captured and mined for
minerals when he addressed the AIAA's annual meeting earlier this
month.
   ``Those same asteroids which promise material riches can be a
threat as well,'' he said. ``In 1965, a small asteroid exploded
high over Canada with a force equivalent to an atomic bomb.
   ``It would certainly benefit all nations to know when such a
natural event might occur, warn those who could be affected and
maybe, some day, even affect whether or where such an event might
happen,'' Quayle said.
   Asteroids are rocky bodies that orbit the sun between Mars and
Jupiter. The ones that have been observed range in size from 579
miles in diameter down to about 700 feet.
   Some have struck Earth in the past. Only last year, an asteroid
bigger than an aircraft carrier and traveling at 46,000 mph passed
within 400,000 miles of the Earth _ a distance less than twice as
far as the moon. It missed Earth by only six hours.
   Such an object probably comes by undetected once every two or
three years, AIAA said. If it landed, ``a disaster of unprecedented
proportions'' and an enormous number of casualties could result.
   Johan Benson, the institute's administrator for public policy,
said a nuclear weapon could be used to destroy or deflect an
asteroid if it was discovered a year or so before impact.
   Another defense measure would be to ``soft-land'' a propulsion
system on the asteroid and slowly push it into an orbit that would
miss Earth.
   Use of a missile would depend on the composition and size of the
asteroid, Benson said. ``It could destroy it, but if exploded
properly, it could simply propel it off into another orbit.''
   The AIAA suggested an international agreement would be needed
for nuclear interception and said, ``This is a particularly good
time to consider an international effort led jointly by the U.S.
and the Soviet Union.''
   Last year's asteroid was not discovered until it had passed. Dr.
Bevan French, a NASA scientist, estimated an impact with Earth
would have equaled an explosion of 20,000 hydrogen bombs.
   If it had hit the northeast corridor of the U.S. or Los Angeles
or Tokyo, said AIAA, millions of people would have died instantly.
   A six-mile-diameter asteroid 65 million years ago is popularly
believed to have caused a global catastrophe that destroyed the
dinosaurs.
   ``Earth-orbit crossing asteroids clearly present a danger to the
Earth and its inhabitants,'' said the AIAA. ``Perhaps we have been
lucky: since 1908 there have been one direct hit, one atmospheric
entry and at least two near misses.''

   In the heart of America, a team of book experts is on a special
mission, sifting through millions of dollars of treasures, trying
to write the final chapter in a mystery some feared never would be
solved.
   Their task is painstaking, their work daunting: to pore over
about 28,000 books and papers _ some rare and priceless, others
ordinary and worthless _ determine which are stolen, then match
them with their owners.
   Their work stems from the FBI's largest-ever seizure of stolen
rare books and manuscripts, a cache valued at up to $40 million,
all recovered this spring from one man's house in Iowa.
   While these library experts are figuring out what belongs to
whom, a bigger question looms: How?
   ``It would be interesting to know how somebody like this can go
into library after library, amassing so many books and it took so
long to put an end to this,'' said William Moffett, president of
the Association of College and Research Libraries.
   Stephen Carrie Blumberg, 41, who is undergoing psychiatric tests
at a Missouri prison hospital after being charged with theft, has a
long history of emotional problems and scrapes with the law. Over
the years, authorities have nabbed him with piles of books, found
him snooping in libraries, tracked and arrested him.
   But this is more than the tale of a troubled man.
   It's the story of how difficult it is to protect some of
America's cultural heritage, how hard-nosed cops know little about
the cloistered work of rare books, and how someone purportedly took
advantage of both weaknesses.
   ``This man apparently was quite brilliant,'' said Gary Menges,
head of the University of Washington's special collections and
preservation and chairman of the library association's rare books
security committee.
   ``He knows the system. He knows the way things work,'' said
Peter Briscoe, collection development officer at the University of
California-Riverside, where Blumberg was arrested in 1988.
``Libraries have done more and more to make things secure. Blumberg
seemed to be one step ahead.''
   An attorney who has known Blumberg and his family for years
disagrees.
   ``He's being portrayed as a master thief,'' said John Daubney, a
St. Paul, Minn., lawyer representing Blumberg in a case in that
state. ``This kid is totally incapable of doing this, physically,
mentally or otherwise. There's no question he apparently had some
books improperly taken ... (but) the great bulk of them were
purchased through legitimate means.
   ``He was more of a buyer than a seller. He was a collector,''
said Daubney, noting that Blumberg had an annual income of more
than $70,000 from family trusts.
   Blumberg, who has spent time in psychiatric hospitals, is a
soft-spoken loner who travels to flea markets in an old truck and
wears old clothes, Daubney said.
   He's fascinated by stained glass windows and door knobs and once
bought an old Minneapolis mansion, selling it at a $100,000 profit,
the attorney added.
   ``The kid is not stupid by any stretch,'' Daubney said. ``He
just thinks differently than the rest of us.''
   Blumberg's legal troubles date back more than 20 years, said
Steve Huntsberry, a corporal with the Washington State University
police who has tracked him as part of an investigation of rare book
thefts at the school.
   Blumberg's record includes a 1967 charge of stealing antique
doorknobs in Iowa and a 1974 accusation of theft in Colorado after
his car was found stuffed with books, Huntsberry said. The latter
case was dropped.
   In 1988, Blumberg, who used the alias of Matt McGue, was fined
and placed on probation after pleading guilty to trespassing and
possessing burglary tools in the closed rare-books section at
California-Riverside, authorities say.
   ``I knew he would get caught again somewhere,'' Huntsberry said.
``I just thought he would skate through it.''
   But on March 20, authorities raided Blumberg's house in Ottumwa,
Iowa, carting off 19 tons of books and papers in one 40-foot van
and a load of antiques in another.
   Dozens of library experts, including an eight-member team from a
group called Online Computer Library Center, which has a database
of 21 million titles, are helping the FBI identify and catalogue
the books and manuscripts, which are warehoused in an office
building in Omaha, Neb.
   ``This is unprecedented in the book world to get that much
attention from the authorities,'' said Jake Chernofsky, editor and
publisher of AB Bookman's Weekly, a publication for antiquarian
book dealers.
   The inventory should be computerized within four weeks, said W.
Dennis Aiken, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Omaha
office.
   ``When we first got into this, we thought it would be an
overwhelming, impossible task,'' he said. ``Very quickly, through
the outpouring of cooperation from the public and private literary
sector, it's becoming a very manageable task.''
   Aiken said tricks were played to conceal book owners; during the
raid, a trunk of bookplates, library cards and other identification
data was found.
   While some books are worthless, one is valued at $70,000 to
$90,000, Aiken said. The FBI said one expert estimated all the
volumes and papers could be worth up to $40 million.
   Authorities say they have found a Bible from 1480 and three
shelves of priceless materials from 1450-1500, an era known as the
incunabula, a period following the invention of the Gutenberg press.
   ``It was apparent that they had been chosen with great care,''
David Schoonover, University of Iowa rare books curator, said of
the nine rooms of floor-to-ceiling books he surveyed at Blumberg's
home.
   Aiken said that while the books and manuscripts come from 140
universities, the bulk are from about 10 schools. Some libraries,
he added, had no idea materials were missing.
   Other valuables also were seized in Minnesota, where Blumberg
was born and lived. Authorities searched three places in
Minneapolis and St. Paul, taking more than 300 stained glass
windows, gold coins, jewelry, silverware, door knobs, antiques and
other items.
   Police plan to show the public a videotape of them this week for
identification purposes.
   Daubney, however, said he has provided the FBI with more than
5,000 receipts _ often nothing more than little scraps of paper _
including some for stained glass windows and gold coins.
   The Blumberg case, some say, illustrates both the problems of
protecting rare books and investigating these thefts.
   Experts say rare book libraries have a delicate balancing act,
making collections accessible, yet secure.
   And police are novices in the area.
   ``It's not the average street creep we're dealing with,'' said
Sgt. Richard Hansen of the Eugene, Ore., police, who investigated
the loss of $662,500 worth of material, including 9,000 to 11,000
manuscripts, believed to have been taken from the University of
Oregon library in 1987.
   ``We don't have a network of contacts. ... It's absolutely fish
out of water,'' Hansen said. ``I had no idea of who's reliable,
who's not.''
   The librarians helping piece together the puzzle will make the
telling difference, Aiken said.
   ``We would not be able to do that without their expertise,'' he
said. ``My career would be over before this got done.''

   He's the last survivor of the Big Four of the
early civil rights movement. Now 70 and totally blind, James
Farmer, founder of the Congress of Racial Equality, is teaching a
special class at a predominantly white college in Virginia. This is
the first of an intermittent series called Class Act, about
prominent men and women in various fields who have returned to the
campus to share their expertise.

   The distinguished visiting professor
with the patch over his right eye tugs at a tweed sleeve and bends
an ear to his chiming wristwatch.
   ``Twenty-eight minutes past one,'' James Farmer announces in
that resonant, mellifluous voice to a hushed class of 40 juniors
and seniors, leaning forward, pens poised over notebooks.
   ``As I was saying, those troopers were bellowing, `Come on out,
Farmer. We know you're in there.'
   ``I was meant to die that night. They were kicking open doors,
beating up blacks in the streets, interrogating them with electric
cattle prods. I got out alive in a hearse.''
   It was a lovely spring day on the campus of predominantly white
Mary Washington College, a state institution in historic
Fredericksburg. Bright sunshine slanting through the budding trees
gave a roseate glow to the white-columned Georgian brick buildings.
   But the imposing black figure at the lecture desk in Monroe Hall
was wrapped in the darkness of another time, in another Southern
state.
   He couldn't see the azaleas blushing at the windowsill or sniff
the cherry blossoms just come into bloom around the fountain in the
square. There was too much tear gas billowing through the busted
windows of the Plymouth Rock Baptist Church in Plaquemine, La. And
the splashing fountain brought back the swoosh of the fire hose
washing hymn books and Bibles down the aisle as the mob smashed
pews and ransacked the church.
   ``Scared spitless,'' Farmer says, recalling that violent summer
night a quarter of a century ago.
   One moment he's a terrified Freedom Rider pleading with the
local telephone operator to put a call through ``to the White
House, the attorney general, the FBI in New Orleans.''
   Then he's a redneck deputy, snarling through jowls chock full of
chaw, ``We know you're in there, Farmer.''
   Next he's the spunky lady operator of the funeral parlor down
the street telling him to ``play dead in the back of that hearse''
and ordering the driver to take dirt roads known only to blacks
since plantation days.
   Then he's himself, the founder of CORE, the Congress of Racial
Equality, wondering if that night in Louisiana, less than a week
after the march on Washington and Martin Luther King's ``I have a
dream'' speech, would be his last on Earth.
   ``This guy is tremendous,'' says senior Rich Cooper, one of the
students in Farmer's course, ``The History of the Civil Rights
Movement,'' a full three-credit course in the history department.
``He's a living piece of history. It's hard for students our age to
imagine an America where blacks could not go into a restaurant, had
to ride in the Jim Crow coach next to the engine and were hunted
down like possums or some other swamp dweller for daring to
register to vote.
   ``Here is a man who has changed history. He's seen it all, and
now the tragedy is he sees nothing.''
   But in the classroom the now totally blind champion of civil
rights sees something he never saw before in his 70 years _ a ray
of hope, ``just a glimmer.''
   ``The hope for America is with these young people,'' he says,
gathering up a bundle of their term papers. ``Their minds are not
closed. At the beginning of the semester, black kids and white kids
alike find it difficult to grasp that this is the way things were
here.''
   With Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young now dead,
Farmer is the last of the Big Four of the civil rights movement.
``We were the knights of the round table,'' he chuckles, counting
the nine steps down to the taxi taking him home for a brief rest
before facing an evening class of nearly 200 freshmen and
sophomores.
   Farmer is now in his fifth year at the college named for George
Washington's mother, where in a student body of 3,500, two-thirds
are female and 4 percent black.
   The preacher's kid from Marshall, Texas, who grew up on a series
of black Baptist campuses, where his father, a Ph.D. from Boston
University taught theology, is still at it, preaching, teaching
with compelling charm a non-violent approach to racial harmony.
   Eloquently he drives home the ``fundamental lesson of the civil
rights movement: Be better than your former self, not better than
the South Africans, and thereby make a better world.''
   Students are awed at Farmer's lack of bitterness toward those
who have wronged him and his race.
   Sherry Brinser, a Spanish major from Richmond, Va., says: ``He's
fascinating. It all happened to him, and yet there's no bitterness.
None. How can he forgive what he can't forget?''
   In the Eagle's Nest, the student snack bar, some compared Farmer
with the actor James Earl Jones: the rich voice, the fullback's
build, the features borrowed from a Roman coin, the deep infectious
laughter, the mimic's ability to play all parts.
   They cited the morning lecture when he was suddenly the owner of
a diner on U.S. Route 1 between New York and Baltimore, turning
away young blacks trying to integrate eateries along what they had
renamed ``Freedom Highway.''
   ``We don't serve Negroes here.''
   ``Well, that's fine by us,'' Farmer replies in his own voice.
``We don't eat them.''
   ``He's very expressive. You think you're right there,'' says
Patty Charron, a junior from Springield, Va.
   ``But he's a lot more than just a performer,'' insists Rich
Cooper, who's from Pittsburgh. ``He speaks from the heart. It's not
like a lecture, it's personal history. Others graduating with me
agree his is one of the five classes you should take before leaving
here.''

   A Japanese gallery bought Vincent van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' for $82.5 million, a record auction
price for any art work and double the price estimated by
Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction house said.
   ``This is by far the world's most expensive painting,''
surpassing the $53.9 million price bid for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in
November 1987 at Sotheby's auction house, Christie's spokeswoman
Susan Britman said Tuesday.

   Chrysler Corp. has decided to produce its
proposed Viper sports car featuring a 10-cylinder engine, a company
source said.
   The Dodge Viper, equipped with an engine originally designed for
truck use, will go into extremely low-volume production late next
year for the 1992 model year, a company source speaking on
condition of anonymity said Tuesday.
   A Viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto
show in Detroit and drew huge crowds. The two-seat convertible is a
throwback to the era of sleek sports cars with few electronic

   Nearly two-thirds of the nation's toxic
industrial waste is produced by 100 corporations and the chemical
industry accounts for almost half, a private group said.
   The group Citizen Action criticized the chemical industry
Tuesday for not moving more quickly to curb toxic releases. The
group said 42 percent of all such pollution comes from chemical
plants and four of the top five polluters are chemical companies.
   A spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said the
organization's members already are committed to making signficant
reductions in hazardous releases in coming years because of public
concern.

   Reduced buyer incentives and low inventories
contributed to an 8.4 percent slide in early-May sales of North
American-made vehicles, analysts say.
   The 10 major U.S. car and truck makers Tuesday reported a 10.3
percent decline in car sales and 5.3 percent drop in truck sales
during the May 1-10 period compared with last year.
   Those figures leave no clear indication of a trend in the
market, said auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York.
   ``We ended April with inventory many dealers described as too
low,'' he said. ``They had such a cautious attitude coming into
this year that they know they lost some sales because of their
caution.''
   The automakers said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate
of 33,448 during the May 1-10 period this year, compared with a
daily rate of 36,524 during the same time last year.
   Sales of cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. slipped 16.9 percent while sales of cars from
``transplants,'' or Japanese-owned U.S. manufacturing plants, rose
85.6 percent.
   Big Three automakers held 86.5 percent of the U.S. market for
domestically produced cars in early May, down from 93.5 percent a
year earlier.
   Last year's sales rate was strong mainly because of the
extension of incentives the Big Three had been offering. As this
April wound up, the companies cut back their incentive programs,
generally reducing the number of vehicles covered and lowering cash
rebates.
   That, said Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff, may have pulled some
would-be May sales into April selling periods as consumers took
advantage of the more generous incentives.
   Brady said if there was any such effect, it was small.
   ``I think it is very difficult to try to quantify that,'' he
said.
   Late-April sales of the Big Three's domestically made vehicles
were 0.1 percent higher than the same period a year ago, which was
a strong period.
   For the year through May 10, sales of domestic vehicles were
down 3.3 percent with car sales off 4.4 percent and truck sales
down 1.4 percent.
   Chrysler, which has seen its share of the U.S. market dwindle,
said its early-May car and truck sales were down 19.2 percent. So
far this year, sales were off 12.9 percent.
   Ford said its combined car and truck sales during early May this
year were 15.4 percent and down 7.9 percent for the year.
   GM said its vehicle sales declined 8.7 percent in early May. For
the year so far, sales were running 2.8 percent below last year's
pace.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major
automakers with U.S. assembly plants for the first period of May
1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 111 selling days so far this year,
compared with 110 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<TEXT>
   A deal between Perkin-Elmer Corp. and a
California company will keep a crucial semiconductor technology in
U.S. hands and may ease fears about an erosion of competitiveness
against Japanese chip makers.
   Perkin-Elmer said Tuesday it had sold a 60 percent stake in its
optical lithography business to Silicon Valley Group Inc. of San
Jose, Calif., for at least $20 million. The division produces
machines that manufacture computer chips and is a critical link in
the semiconductor industry.
   International Business Machines Inc. also plays a key role in
the deal. IBM is buying a minority stake in the business and has
agreed to help develop its technology and place big orders for its
equipment.
   Norwalk-based Perkin-Elmer also will retain a minority stake.
   Mark Fitzgerald, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, said the
deal represents an effort by the American industry to save a
business that the U.S. had led until the Japanese began making
inroads 10 years ago.
   ``The real story here is that we're seeing U.S. companies band
together to defend a key technology for future chip development,''
he said. ``This is an important technology. We're not going to let
it outside this country.''
   The division, which Perkin-Elmer has been seeking to sell for
two years, makes machines that use optical lithography to etch
patterns on computer chips. Its Micrascan System can etch patterns
on smaller wafers with greater sharpness and promises to be a key
tool in efforts to build ever more powerful computer chips.
   Perkin-Elmer reportedly discussed a possible sale of the
division to Nikon Corp. last year. The reports touched off concern
that a loss of such vital technology could hamper the ability of
American chip makers to compete with Japanese companies.
   The division's technology still is being developed and will not
be used in full-scale manufacturing for two to three years,
although IBM is using three machines in Essex Junction, Vt., to
develop new semiconductors, said company spokesman Paul Bergevin.
   FitzGerald said the technology is ahead of what the Japanese
have developed.
   ``The Japanese have such an insurmountable lead at this point in
time that if this technology went to a Japanese company, the U.S.
suppliers would be totally out of leading-edge work'' in
semiconductors, he said.
   The deal adds another dimension to SVG's semiconductor business.
The company already makes equipment that prepares wafers for the
lithography patterning.
   ``I can assure you, with the right partners here, we have an
excellent chance to be a global supplier and global competitor,''
said Papken S. Der Torossian, president and chief executive officer
of SVG. The company earned $9.6 million on sales of $130 million
last year.
   He said his company already has paid $20 million for the
business, to be called SVG Lithography Systems Inc. He would not
say if SVG would make further payments or place a total value on
the deal but said the financial arrangements would be detailed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   FitzGerald valued the business at under $100 million.
   IBM will provide an unspecified amount of funds to develop the
lithography equipment, along with a chemical compound used to coat
the wafer surface for the etching process. It also has committed to
buying ``tens of millions of dollars'' worth of the new machines,
Bergevin said.
   Sematech, a consortium of government and industry leaders, also
will provide development funding along with technical support and
help in improving the technology, said Vahe A. Sarkissian, the new
unit's president.
   IBM will have first dibs on the new Micrascan equipment, as will
other Sematech members with existing orders.
   Operations will be consolidated in a single building in Wilton,
Conn. SVG plans to retain all 800 workers.
   For Perkin-Elmer, the sale is the final step in the company's
two-year effort to divest and concentrate on analytical
instruments. The company, which had $784 million in sales and $47
million in profits last year, already has sold its electro-optics
division, electron beam unit and German aerospace business.

<HEAD>Court Approves $250 Million Financing For Ames; Company Posts
Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAVOIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores officials, struggling to
revive the ailing discount retail chain, say a new $250 million
loan agreement is the first step toward restoring confidence in the
company.
   ``This is what it's going to take to start this company on the
road to recovery,'' said Michael Cook, the lead attorney
representing Ames in hearings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where the
credit was approved Tuesday.
   Ames also said it had cut the number of store closings planned
immediately from 74 to 33, but said it still is reviewing its
operations and could close more stores later.
   The nation's fourth-largest retailer filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 25
after many suppliers who had not been paid for earlier deliveries
stopped shipping merchandise. The company also was unable to get a
new credit agreement from its lenders to ease a cash flow crunch.
   Officials said the new $250 million line of credit will allow
the company to pay vendors on time and keep merchandise coming into
its 680 stores.
   ``I believe it was what we needed to hear to give the trade
(vendors) the security to feel free to ship us the goods we need,''
said Ames President George Granoff.
   The agreement approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard C.
Buschman III allows Ames to borrow up to $250 million from Chemical
Bank.
   Buschman authorized the financing after a group of 33 banks
withdrew its objection to the plan.
   In his order, the judge said Ames did not have sufficient
working capital to finance its operations.
   ``Absent such availability, the debtors cannot supply their
retail stores with the inventory they need in order to ensure
adequate sales levels and continued customer loyalty,'' Buschman
said.
   Stephen L. Pistner, Ames' new chief executive officer,
confidently predicted the company would make a comeback with the
new financing.
   ``If we want to save this company, it takes money and competent
business. I know how to do the rest,'' Pistner said.
   Buschman postponed a final hearing on Pistner's appointment as
CEO until May 24. Creditors had asked for more time to review terms
of his contract, which could pay him up to $8 million in salary,
bonuses and benefits over three years.
   A bank group headed by New York's Citibank withdrew its
objection to the $250 million loan after reaching an agreement with
Ames early Tuesday.
   Ronald DeKoven, an attorney for the banks, said the agreement
allows the banks to split with the company $91 million in cash
collateral Ames has in its account. He said the agreement also
resolves a dispute between Ames and the bankers over outstanding
letters of credit totaling $65 million.
   Ames owes the Citibank group about $450 million. The banks had
objected to Ames' request to borrow the further $250 million
because Chemical's loan would have a higher repayment priority than
the Citibank group's debt.
   Antonio Alvarez, a principal in a New York consulting firm that
helped Ames negotiate the loan with Chemical, told the judge that
the company has been unable to convince vendors to ship goods. He
said if the trend continued, the company could see sales drop 40
percent or more.
   The court earlier had approved $25 million in credit from
Chemical Bank. Ames, which claims it has been losing more than $10
million a week, said it needed the additional $225 million to pay
vendors and assure the company of merchandise for the critical
back-to-school and Christmas sale seasons.
   ``The company has literally been bleeding to death,'' said Cook.
   An attorney representing a committee of Ames creditors said the
group was satisfied with the new financing arrangement.
   ``Our committee did want this approved, because the company
needs the money to keep operating,'' said the attorney, John M.
Friedman Jr. ``I think this will be a big help in getting back to a
sense of normalcy with the vendors.''
   Also Tuesday, Ames said it lost $228 million, or $6.41 a share,
in the year that ended Jan. 27. The loss, which the company
predicted last month, compared with earnings of $42 million, or
$1.07 a share, in 1989.

<HEAD>Time Warner Unit Suspends Publication of Southpoint Magazine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southpoint magazine, a regional publication from
a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., has suspended publication after
the June issue in another sign of tough times in the magazine
business.
   Southern Progress Corp., based in Birmingham, Ala., said Tuesday
that Southpoint had not achieved its circulation and advertising
goals.
   ``In a difficult magazine environment, we decided it best to
utilize our resources elsewhere within our company,'' said Don
Logan, chief executive of Southern Progress, which also publishes
books and five other magazines.
   There have been signs throughout the magazine business this year
that advertising growth has been sluggish at best. The Magazine
Publishers of America said advertising pages in magazines were down
3.5 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with a year
ago.
   In one notable example of the depressed state of the ad market,
businessman Leonard Stern closed 7 Days magazine last month because
of insufficient advertising. The award-winning magazine covered the
New York arts scene for two years.
   On Monday, Hachette SA put its Woman's Day magazine up for sale.
The women's service magazine had suffered a 22.1 percent decline in
ad pages during the first quarter following a 15 percent decline in
circulation in 1989.
   Southern Progress acquired a controlling interest in Southern
magazine in March 1989 and transformed it from a regional
publication of general interest that focused on the arts,
literature and culture into one that focused on business and travel
topics.
   The transformation took effect with the October 1989 issue in
which the monthly publication's name was changed to Southpoint.
   ``We set certain goals, but it did not meet our expectations in
either advertising or circulation and newsstand sales were soft,''
Logan said.
   He said the magazine was losing money but did not say how much.
Its circulation rate base was 250,000 with the large majority sold
by subscription.
   Logan said the company has no plans to publish any more editions
of the magazine after the June issue, which comes out in the next
10 days, but would be interested in talking to anyone who wants to
buy the magazine.
   He said he told the staff on Monday of the decision to cease
publication, and said efforts would be made to find them positions
with the company's other publications. He said Southpoint employed
27 people full-time.
   Southern Progress' other titles include Southern Living, a
regional monthly home and service magazine with a 2.3 million
circulation; Cooking Light, a bimonthly magazine on cooking that
has just boosted its circulation rate base to 900,000; and Southern
Accents, a home furnishings magazine published 10 times a year with
a circulation of 250,000.
   It also publishes Travel South, a regional quarterly, and
Progressive Farmer, a 103-year-old magazine aimed at the rural
market which has editions aimed at the South and the Midwest with
combined circulation of 650,000.
   The company also is a major regional book publisher.

about $90 million in commercial finance loans.
   The transaction, subject to closing conditions and regulatory
approval, is expected to close by June 30.
   Associates, part of the financial services group of Ford Motor
Co., will acquire 96 consumer finance offices in 17 states,
principally in the Midwest and western states. They have assets of
about $460 million.
   ``The acquisition of the Mellon receivables and offices will be
a significant addition to our nationwide consumer finance
network,'' Associates Chairman Reece Overcash Jr.
   Mellon said proceeds of the sale will help finance its pending
acquisition of 54 branches in Pennsylvania from Meritor Savings
Bank. That transaction is expected to be completed by the end of
this month.
   Mellon, based in Pittsburgh, received federal approval on April
11 to purchase the branches.
   Associates, based in Dallas, said it is the nation's third
largest independent finance company with assets of more than $15
billion. Mellon Bank is one of the nation's largest bank holding
companies with assets of $30.8 billion at March 31.

<HEAD>Viper a Go at Chrysler, Analysts Split on Merits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s decision to go ahead with
production of its high-performance Viper sports car may not make
much money for the strapped automaker, but it could draw crowds
into dealer showrooms, analysts say.
   A company source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday that Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca would announce approval
of the project at a news conference Friday in Los Angeles.
   The source had few details about the project, but said it was
aimed at starting production in late 1991 for the 1992 model year.
   Production volume and a retail price were not available.
However, there have been reports that Chrysler was aiming at
building no more than a few thousand a year, and AutoWeek magazine
said its price could be as much as $40,000.
   The cost of the project also was not available. But company
officials said use of a new computer-aided design process was
helping keep costs down.
   The car would be equipped with a V-10 engine which reportedly
would put it in a performance class with the hottest Corvette ever
made, the ZR-1. AutoWeek said it has the capability of going from a
standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds. The Corvette
ZR-1 reaches the same speed in about 11.5 seconds, according to a
road test in Road &amp; Track magazine.
   Some analysts questioned the wisdom of developing such a
muscular, narrowly focused car when Chrysler is wrestling with
slumping sales and in the throes of a $1.5 billion cost-cutting
program.
   Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said he wasn't excited about
the project but thought it would do respectably well in the market.
   ``If you are going to make a penny on it in low volume, you're
going to have to price it up there,'' he said.
   Analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New
York said there was a place for the car.
   ``There is an enthusiasts market out there,'' she said. ``If
they come out with something that's really sensational, it's
conceivable they could sell out however many they choose to make.''
   Sudol and Brady agreed that the Viper should serve as a magnet
in dealerships, drawing in curious consumers who may end up buying
something else.
   That's already happened at Lynn Hickey Dodge of Oklahoma City,
general sales manager David Slone said. He said media reports of
the car have boosted showroom traffic.
   ``I know we've sold one Daytona off it,'' he said. ``Anything
that piques the traffic is what we want. Anything that shows people
that Dodge is back in the performance business is good news.''
   A Viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto
show in Detroit and drew huge crowds. The two-seat convertible is a
throwback to the era of sleek, high-powered sports cars with few
electronic gadgets.
   The prototype has been part of a six-city tour this spring
during which Chrysler executives have touted the quality of the
company's vehicles, comparing them favorably with those made by
Japanese automakers. The tour ends Friday in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>American Airlines Continues Expansion, Despite Distractions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain. Meeting scheduled to begin at 10
a.m. CDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aggressive expansion plan at
American Airlines shows little sign of slowing despite a first
quarter loss and concerns over increasing fuel costs and contract
negotiations with pilots.
   That's how it should be, say most analysts, who see current
weaknesses as an investment in future strength.
   Stockholders seem to agree. There was nothing on the agenda of
today's annual meeting to indicate dissatisfaction with AMR Corp.,
American's parent company.
   Chairman Robert L. Crandall is scheduled to report on the events
of 1989, that included a aborted takeover attempt by Donald Trump
and the end of record quarterly profits.
   ``I think it's a situation where if the company were stagnant,
that might help profits in the very short run, but it would be
detrimental in the long run,'' said Jessica Tully, an airline
industry analyst at the Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner brokerage in Dallas.
   Illustrating AMR's growth strategy, the company is upgrading its
international service _ and announced the plan less than a week
after it reported a $19.3 million first quarter loss.
   American's ``International Flagship Service'' _ featuring French
wine, plush seats, fresh linens and haute cuisine _ is part of a
$21 billion, five-year expansion program. The carrier will spend
about $14 billion on new aircraft and about $6 billion on terminal
facilities and other items, spokesman Al Becker said Tuesday.
   The company has orders or options for 500 planes through 1994,
many intended to serve overseas markets and help reduce the fleet's
average age to less than 9 years. The newer, more efficient planes
should help American contain rising fuel costs better than its
rivals, analysts say.
   The expansion follows seven years during which American doubled
in size to become the No. 1 U.S. carrier. It has put American in
position to gain from the faltering of such weaker rivals as Pan
American World Airways and Trans World Airlines.
   ``They are financially stronger and this is an industry where
the strong are getting stronger,'' said analyst Samuel Buttrick of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``American is distancing itself from the
pack.''
   One result, however, has been depressed earnings due to
expansion costs, plus higher fuel and labor expenses.
   AMR's first quarter loss compared with a profit of $156.7
million in the same period a year earlier. For all of 1989, profits
were down nearly 4.5 percent from the previous year, to $454.8
million.
   ``We expect that 1990 will be a difficult year as a result of
high fuel prices, weak traffic and downward pressure on yield,''
Crandall said in the company's annual report.
   ``However ... we believe the company has great long-term
strength and, for that reason, I remain optimistic about the
prospects for AMR in the years ahead.''
   AMR stock closed at $66 a share Tuesday, well below its high for
the past year of $107.25 in the midst of Trump's takeover try.
There has been little sign of shareholder dissatisfaction despite
the decline, however.
   Trump criticized AMR's refusal to pay a dividend and its low
stock price in making his $7 billion offer. The bid collapsed
following the stock market's drop on Oct. 13, 1989, when the Dow
Jones industrial average plummeted 190 points.
   AMR hasn't looked back since, focusing on its expansion.
   Besides billions in plane orders, American recently paid $471
million for the Latin American routes of Eastern Airlines and $195
million for TWA's Chicago-to-London route authority and facilities
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.
   ``They're not biting off more than they can chew because there's
no one around to really stop them,'' said analyst Kevin Murphy at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.

<HEAD>New Ink Tags Spot Shoplifters _ or Dye Trying</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report and on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to deter increasingly crafty
shoplifters, a growing number of clothing stores are turning to a
sort of doomsday device _ a tag that, if tampered with, squirts the
garment with an indelible dye.
   The theory: Sometimes you have to ruin a dress to save it.
   ``If thieves know they can't sell it and they can't wear it,
then they won't steal it,'' says Don Barnett, whose company makes
ColorTag, one of two such products on the market.
   The other is called INKTAG, and here's how it works.
   You, the shoplifter, are strolling through a department store
when you see an Anne Klein cream linen suit for $515 that you must
have.
   You notice a white plastic disc about two inches in diameter
clamped on the skirt like a sandwich. It bears this ``WARNING:
Forcing tag open causes breakage. Permanent ink sprays out. Injury
can occur from broken glass, metal and ink.''
   Since grenades are not customarily attached to dresses, you
disregard the warning. Anyway, you figure, you can always remove
the disc in the safety of your own home. So you take it into the
dressing room, stuff it into your purse, and head for the exit.
   You step out of the store, exultant. But when you get the dress
home and try to pry the disc off with a screwdriver, your hands are
suddenly squirted with blue, red and yellow ink that also stains
the dress.
   The stain wears off your hands in a few days, but repeated trips
to the dry cleaner fail to eradicate the dress spot. You can't wear
it anywhere, except to Halloween parties and the hipper downtown
clubs.
   Three vials inside the disc-tag were rigged to break when it
did, releasing three teaspoons of ``a biological stain that
interacts with the cells of natural fibers so it can't be washed
out,'' according to Robert DiLonardo of Security Tag Systems in St.
Petersburg, Fla., which makes INKTAG.
   If the garment had been purchased, the tag would have been
cleanly removed by a sales clerk with a small device bolted down
next to the cash register.
   DiLonardo said his company has sold several hundred thousand
tags to 40 stores since production began last fall; ColorTag says
its product, on sale for two years, now is used in hundreds of
stores.
   Michael Myers, vice president of security for the Casual Corner
chain of women's clothing stores, says ColorTag has reduced losses
by about 60 percent at the 40 stores where they have been tried. He
described the reduction as ``incredible,'' and said the company
plans to order more.
   A quarter century ago, stores began tagging merchandise with
magnetic strips and installing detectors at the door. But store
security officials say professional shoplifters _ who account for
about 85 percent of all shoplifts _ have learned how to remove the
tags in the store and to shield them from the detector on the way
out.
   Meanwhile, shoplifting is soaring. Annual estimated losses
exceed $25 billion, and one study found that shoplifters escape
with the goods 97 percent of the time.
   The ink tag concept originated in Sweden, and has been used in
Europe for six years. Store security consultant Peter Berlin says
that since such tags are more expensive than magnetic ones _
INKTAGs cost about $2.75 each _ they may be better suited for
smaller clothing stores.
   But Berlin says the tags appear to be effective. Despite the
label warning, there is no explosion when the vials break, and
little chance of accidents. ``It really has to be abused before it
breaks,'' said DiLonardo.
   Sometimes, however, clerks forget to remove the tags from
purchased items. DiLonardo said one woman brought her wedding dress
home and found the tag still attached; despite the warning, her
fiance insisted he could get it off. He did _ and she had to walk
down the aisle in another dress.

   Circle K Corp., the nation's second largest
convenience store chain, has filed for protection from its
creditors while it reorganizes, the company's spokesman says.
   The filing comes a week after the resignation of Karl Eller as
chairman and chief executive officer of the debt-ridden chain.
   Spokesman Ray Cox says the company filed for protection under
Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court Tuesday evening.
   While Eller was chairman, Circle K grew from about 1,200 stores
in 1983 to a high of 4,685 in 33 states and 1,400 licensed or joint
ventures overseas. But the new stores cost $850 million, and Circle
K has struggled under the debt.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen, Stocks Fall in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded slightly against the yen today
after a five-day decline, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 151.95 yen, up 0.65 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 151.3 yen. After opening at 150.9 yen, it ranged between
150.89 yen and 152.6 yen.
   The dollar had fallen 6.75 yen in the five previous trading days.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar was
bought largely by life insurance firms and importers, and its
advance was accelerated in the afternoon.
   Kuroda said the market was keenly awaiting several U.S. economic
indicators this week, including the consumer price index and
housing starts in April, to be announced later today in Washington,
and merchandise trade figures for March, due out Thursday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which fell 45.61 points Tuesday, declined by another 29.42
points, or 0.09 percent, closing at 31,967.62 points.
   A total of 750 million shares changed hands, down from the
previous day's 900 million.
   At the end of the morning session, the index was up 50.64
points, but it fell back in the afternoon on profit-taking,
securities dealers said.
   ``The market needed a respite'' after sharp gains Friday and
Monday, said Yoshihide Koyama, an analyst with Nikko Securities.
The index gained 531.88 points Friday and 530.51 points Monday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.9 points as of 5 p.m. from
Tuesday's close of 88.18. Their yield stood at 6.98 percent, up
from the previous day's 6.92 percent.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Leaders Defend Company Against Unfair Labor Charges</HEAD>

   Nordstrom Inc. leaders fended off
charges of unfair labor practices and said they see no reason to
change the way the upscale retail chain does business.
   Long noted for its sterling service, Nordstrom faces labor
grievances and a union class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of
approximately 100,000 employees.
   The company's shareholders contend in a separate suit that
Nordstrom should have revealed the extent of its labor problems,
which will be costly to resolve.
   But Nordstrom Co-Chairman Bruce Nordstrom told shareholders at
the retailer's annual meeting Tuesday the company has concluded
that only record-keeping changes are required to address the labor
grievances.
   ``Not only does the system work, it also is fair and just,''
Nordstrom said.
   Union leader Joe Peterson, clad in a tuxedo for the meeting at
the posh Four Seasons Hotel, said labor violations were systematic
and could cost Nordstrom up to $300 million in back pay and
damages. He said the union would fight for years if necessary to
get employees the money.
   ``This dispute is not going to end,'' Peterson, head of the
United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 1001, told reporters
before the meeting. ``The company needs to sit down and find
reasonable solutions to this problem.''
   Bruce Nordstrom and his cousins James and John Nordstrom told
reporters the company set aside $15 million last year to cover the
cost of the labor dispute.
   They said they expect to settle many of the labor complaints,
but added they also expect the union will file more to keep
pressure on the company.
   With $2.6 billion in annual sales, Seattle-based Nordstrom calls
itself the nation's largest independently owned specialty fashion
chain. Its reputation for service was polished over decades and is
practiced at 60 stores in Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska,
Virginia and Utah.
   Nordstrom officials attribute the high level of service to the
company's incentive system.
   ``To inspire a will to succeed among its employees,'' the latest
annual report says, ``the company adopted a commission pay
structure that rewards the salespeople for their fine efforts.''
   But in its lawsuit, the union representing Washington Nordstrom
workers says those policies force employees to work unpaid hours
stocking shelves, make deliveries on days off, cart merchandise
from one store to another, do inventory work at home and skip
lunches and coffee breaks.
   The union collected about 600 complaints from California
Nordstrom workers and about 600 more from workers in other states.
Most claims contend employees worked four to 10 hours per week
without pay, averaging about $4,000 per year in lost wages.
   Nordstrom maintains the union stirred up complaints about back
pay after contract negotiations reached an impasse. The last
contract expired July 31.
   The company now insists that union membership no longer be
mandatory in Washington.
   How much the labor woes have affected consumer confidence in
Nordstrom is in debate.
   The company said this month that its first-quarter profits were
off 43 percent, at $13.2 million. The Nordstroms attributed the
decline almost entirely to problems with inventory, the Northern
California quake that devastated a big store and price cutting
throughout the industry.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp., unable to handle its debt load
after a junk bond-financed expansion program, has filed for U.S.
Bankruptcy Court protection from its creditors.
   The nation's second largest convenience store chain said it
filed for Chapter 11 protection late Tuesday.
   A news release issued by the company today did not mention the
amount of its debts or assets. The Arizona Republic said the filing
listed more than $1 billion in liabilities and about the same
amount in assets. It listed 47,000 creditors, the newspaper said.
   According to the Republic, the company's daily operations _
including payment of all outstanding and future money orders issued
by Circle K _ will continue as usual and stores will remain open.
   The filing came one week after Karl Eller resigned as chairman
and chief executive officer.
   While Eller was chairman, Circle K grew from about 1,200 stores
with annual sales of $750 million in 1983 to a high of 4,685 in 33
states and 1,400 licensed or joint ventures overseas and annual
revenues of $3.5 billion over the next six years.
   But the new stores cost $850 million, much of it raised by
high-yield junk bonds, and Circle K has struggled under the debt,
which required annual interest payments of $100 million.
   In April, Circle K said its largest stockholder,
Cincinnati-based American Financial Corp., and an 11-member
consortium of creditor banks gave it seven months to come up with a
plan to restructure its debt.
   The company said today it was still negotiating on a so-called
``standstill'' agreement that would provide for the deferring for
all principal and interest payment through Oct. 31.
   The company lost more than $28 million in the three months that
ended Jan. 31.
   Circle K is the second-largest convenience store chain after
7-Eleven, operated by Southland Corp. of Dallas. Southland, which
was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1987, also was unable to
pay its debts and was forced to sell a controlling interest to a
partner in the buyout, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. of Japan.
   The two convenience store retailers are among the growing number
of companies that have been overwhelmed by debt following buyouts
or expansions. Campeau Corp.'s department store divisions and Ames
Department Stores Inc. also have been forced into bankruptcy court.
   Circle K has faced growing competition from 24-hour supermarkets
and rival gasoline dealers. About 42 percent of Circle K's gross
revenues in fiscal 1989 came from gasoline sales.
   Bankruptcy Court Clerk Kevin O'Brien said the case is the
second-largest in the history of the court's Arizona District,
behind the case of American Continental Corp. filed in April 1989.
   The American Continental case involves $3.9 billion in assets
and $2.9 billion in liabilities.

<TEXT>
   Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.,
owner of the nation's largest home video chain, said it expects to
hold at 10 percent of the video rental market by the end of this
year.
   The company announced at its annual meeting Tuesday plans to
continue fattening Blockbuster Video's market share, including a
promotional strategy new to the industry _ an eight-week, $10
million contest for customers offering prizes ranging from free
popcorn to $100,000 in cash.
   ``We have the tools we need to do the job,'' said H. Wayne
Huizenga, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Marketing plans also include a continued emphasis on national TV
advertising, said Thomas A. Gruber, the company's chief marketing
officer.
   Blockbuster's 1989 revenue was $663 million, more than the
chain's 16 largest competitors combined, Huizenga said. Analysts
project sales will total $1.1 billion in 1990.
   The 90-minute meeting attended by 800 shareholders had a
decidedly Hollywood flavor. It opened with the theme from ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'' and a film reviewing the company's performance
in 1989 included footage of the Marx Brothers and Three Stooges.
   Among those in attendance were Miami Dolphins president Tim
Robbie and Coach Don Shula. Earlier this year, Huizenga purchased a
15-percent share in the Dolphins and a 50-percent stake in the
team's stadium.
   Huizenga purchased the Blockbuster chain in 1987, when it
consisted of 19 stores. Now there are 1,200.
   With Americans renting a million videotapes a day, Blockbuster
expects to increase its share of that market from the current 6
percent to 7 percent to 10 to 11 percent in 1990, Huizenga said.
   Blockbuster plans to continue to open 400 stores per year until
the total in the United States and Canada reaches 3,000. The
company also has stores in Europe, Puerto Rico and Guam.

<HEAD>Soybeans Gain, Grain Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were slightly higher in
early trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade in a
tenuous recovery from three days of sharp losses.
   Grain futures were mixed with corn lower and wheat was higher.
   Soybean futures fell a total of nearly 35 cents a bushel from
Friday through Tuesday.
   This morning's modest rally indicates the lower prices are
attracting bullish speculators to the soybean market, said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But other recent trading sessions also began with a soybean
rally, so early action cannot be taken as a predictor of the
market's direction.
   Excessive rain in the Southern Plains continued to boost wheat
futures amid talk of damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Corn futures were down slightly on ideas that credit problems
will prevent the Soviet Union from buying more U.S corn.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.85 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 2} cents lower with May at $2.82 a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with May at $1.55{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3\ cents higher with May at $6.14 a
bushel.
   Pork futures were sharply higher in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange amid a combination of higher cash markets,
bullish chart signals and signs of unexpectedly strong demand for
pork bellies. Cattle futures were mixed.
   Live cattle futures were .07 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
June at 74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .25
cent higher with May at 84.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to 1.18 cents higher with June at 64.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .05 cent to 2 cents higher with May at 64.22
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

   Shareholders defeated a proposal calling
for Upjohn Co. to sever South African ties, but the pharmaceutical
company said it may sell one of its two South African plants
because of poor sales.
   Upjohn President Theodore Cooper said at Tuesday's annual
meeting he hopes a buyer is found by summer for Asgrow SA, which
develops vegetable seeds and employs about 100 people.
   Upjohn doesn't plan to phase out its other South African
subsidiary, the Upjohn Ltd. pharmaceutical firm, as long as it
meets the company's ``social objectives and business objectives,''
Cooper said.
   ``At present, the board believes the company's continued
presence in South Africa is justified,'' he said.
   Shareholders also rejected a proposal to institute confidential
shareholder votes, also opposed by the company's directors.
   Cooper had opened last year's annual meeting by denying rumors
that the pharmaceutical giant was for sale, and opened Tuesday's
meeting by saying that stance is the same despite an industry trend
toward consolidation.
   ``And you can see, we did not sell it in the last year, nor do
we intend to sell it in the future,'' he said.
   He said Upjohn is looking at possible projects in the Soviet
Union and looking for new markets for drugs such as its Rogaine
baldness treatment and Xanax anti-anxiety drug.
   Upjohn reported net earnings of $176 million on net sales of
$2.91 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Deere Chairman Announces Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert A. Hanson, who directed Deere &amp; Co.
through its stormiest financial period and into profitability,
announced Tuesday he is retiring as chairman.
   Hanson, 65, said he would step down June 1 after 40 years with
the manufacturer of tractors and agricultural implements.
   Deere president and chief executive officer Hans W. Becherer was
expected to be named chairman at the company's next board meeting.
   Last August, Hanson gave up his title as chief executive in
anticipation of his retirement, which is mandatory at Deere when an
executive reaches age 66.
   Hanson is an East Moline native and was the first person not a
member of the Deere family by blood or marriage to run the
153-year-old company.
   Hanson became president in 1978 and a year later was named chief
operating officer. He became chairman in 1982 as the company stood
on the brink of economic collapse.
   Deere accumulated $328 million in losses in two years and its
operating losses totaled $637 million in the six-year period of
1982-87.
   Hanson implemented a deep cost-cutting program and laid off
about 12,000 workers to combat the recession.
   His problems were compounded by a 163-day work stoppage at 13
Deere plants in Illinois, Iowa and four other states that ended
Feb. 1, 1987 when workers accepted a wage freeze and other
concessions.

<HEAD>Castle &amp; Cooke Delays Proposed Separation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tightening of the real estate credit market
has prompted Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. to delay the planned sale of its
Dole Food Co. subsidiary to stockholders.
   In a statement, the company said its directors decided Tuesday
that acceptable bank financing would not available if the Dole
subsidiary was spun off, an action that would have left Castle &amp;
Cooke solely as a real estate company.
   The split-up plan, announced in February, called for
distribution of one share of Dole Food Co. stock for each Castle &amp;
Cooke share held. What remained of the company, Oceanic Properties
Inc., was to have been renamed Castle &amp; Cooke. Oceanic is known for
its ownership of virtually all of the Hawaiian island of Lanai and
the town of Mililani in central Oahu.
   Chairman David Murdock said the Los Angeles-based company
remained committed to a restructuring of its operations that
includes separation of the food and real estate operations.
   Castle &amp; Cooke reported first quarter net income of $18.1
million, up from $12.5 million in the same quarter last year.
Earnings per common share were 30 cents, compared with 21 cents for
the same period in 1989. Revenue increased to $658 million, up from
$563 million in 1989.

   The stock market turned downward from record
levels today while traders assessed inflation statistics that came
in close to expectations.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.02 to 2,813.43
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 449 up, 910 down and
504 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.2 percent in April, compared to 0.5 percent
increases in the two preceding months.
   Analysts said that reinforced recent evidence that inflation was
not reviving to the extent that traders had feared through much of
the winter and early spring.
   At the same time, they said, the market seemed largely to have
anticipated the news with its rise to record highs earlier in the
week.
   It appeared that investors now are looking for signs that
inflationary pressures and interest rates can continue their recent
decline.
   Hewlett-Packard dropped 1&lsqb; to 46~ in active trading. The company
reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter ended April 30 of
78 cents a share, down from 86 cents in the comparable period a
year earlier.

   Bouncing back into the black, First Executive
Corp. reported first quarter earnings of $45.5 million and said
cash withdrawals on its annuities had declined.
   Tuesday's report follows an $836 million net loss for the fourth
quarter of 1989 that the company attributed to a writedown of its
junk bond portfolio.
   At 32 cents a share, earnings for the quarter that ended March
31 were up from a net loss of $44.1 million, or 52 cents per share,
for the same period a year ago.
   First Executive also finished the quarter with about $3 billion
in assets, including government securities, chairman and Chief
Executive Fred Carr said in a statement.
   The company's financial troubles stemmed largely from its heavy
investment in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. The bonds comprised
45 percent of First Executive's total invested assets at the end of
1989.
   Analysts had said the company was threatened by the possibility
that customers, alarmed by its sagging junk bond portfolio, would
cancel life insurance policies and withdraw money from annuities.
   But President Alan Snyder said Tuesday cancellations and
withdrawals were declining.
   First Executive's principal subsidiaries are Executive Life of
California and Executive Life of New York.

   Strategic alliances once referred to the Common
Market, OPEC, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. But now they also mean
GE-Tungsram, IBM-Siemens and Daimler-Mitsubishi.
   International corporate joint ventures, the latest trend in a
shrinking world, are redefining economic strengths and increasingly
eroding the importance of national boundaries in business.
   More than a dozen joint ventures have been announced in the past
six months, some between giant rivals, others between the strong
and meek. To a large degree, they reflect the inability of any one
company, regardless how rich, to compete in the world marketplace
without help from a partner.
   The latest catalyst for many joint ventures seems to be a desire
to exploit enormous changes in Europe.
   The 12-nation Common Market is eliminating internal trade
barriers in 1992, creating what amounts to the biggest single
market of affluent consumers anywhere. In Eastern Europe, many
businesses are beckoning Western partners after four decades of
now-repudiated communist control.
   Despite the creative powers harnessed by joint ventures, they
pose problems that ultimately conflict with national sovereignty,
experts say.
   For example, it could be more difficult for governments to
regulate and tax the companies involved. Joint ventures also may
make it harder to determine who builds what products, complicating
enforcement of trade quotas and tariffs.
   What nationality, for example, is a car with a Chrysler
nameplate, designed jointly by Chrysler and Mitsubishi and built by
Americans at a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Illinois?
   The alliances also have raised concerns about concentration of
industrial power, such as the plans by Daimler-Benz, West Germany's
largest industrial group, to form joint ventures with the
Mitsubishi companies, Japanese's largest industrial conglomerate.
That announcement also raised the specter of a resurrected World
War II alliance: Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi armed the Axis.
   Another concern is that some venture partners may be mismatched.
The Economist magazine recently editorialized that participants
could spend the rest of the 20th century ``unraveling a tangle of
reckless marriages.''
   ``Many alliances are essentially defensive moves by sluggards to
resist nimbler competitors,'' the magazine said. ``If a firm cannot
compete, it is probably doomed, no matter how many dancing partners
it has signed up.''
   Among alliances announced in recent months:
   _International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
computer maker, will develop computer memory chips with Siemens AG,
West Germany's largest electronics company.
   _American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and NEC Corp., the huge
Japanese electronics company, will make semiconductors and
cooperate on other computer technologies.
   _General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, bought a
half-interest in carmaking operations of Sweden's Saab-Scania AB.
   _Chrysler Corp. and Austrian automaker Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG
will make Chrysler's minivans in Austria.
   _AB Volvo of Sweden and Renault, the French goverment-owned
automaker, will buy stakes in each other and engage in joint
research, product development and purchasing.
   _General Electric Co. entered into one of the largest deals in
East Europe by buying control of the Hungarian light bulb maker
Tungsram.
   Many joint ventures of the past few months depart from the
historical model, said Stephen J. Kobrin, professor of management
at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   Previously, he said, a joint venture was viewed as a foothold
abroad. It typically involved a multinational company taking a
stake in a local firm that would provide market access.
   But many ventures are alliances between multinationals _ often
competitors _ in which they agree to jointly work on a new
technology or share product development costs.
   ``I think what's driving a lot of them is technology,'' Kobrin
said. ``The complexity of technology is such that even huge,
leading-edge firms don't have all the knowledge and skills they
need to deal with it.''
   Moreover, he said, ``the amount of money is so huge that a
prudent private firm wouldn't want to do it on its own. You can't
afford one failure.''
   Corporations can't support the necessary research by selling in
just a few markets, said David Wyss, an economist with the research
firm DRI-McGraw Hill.
   However, Stephen Chazen, a mergers and acquisitions banker with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said he believes access to foreign markets is
the overriding reason for most of these ventures.
   ``They take the cheapest approach, which is to make some sort of
deal,'' he said.
   Wyss said joint ventures have gained popularity as international
buyout activity has slowed due to increasingly tight credit
conditions, which makes borrowing money for takeovers more
expensive. He predicted the joint-venture trend will continue for
some time.
   ``We are moving much more toward a global economy. Those
companies that can't participate globally are going to be
restricted to areas where they can compete, which means relatively
low-technology sectors,'' he said.
   But Wyss said some of these joint ventures may not have been
well thought-out.
   ``Some companies are sort of panicking at being squeezed out of
these markets. So they're finding someone to jump into bed with.
That doesn't necessarily make for good long-term relations,'' he
said.
   Kobrin said the alliances pose another problem.
   ``The primary concern with a lot of strategic alliances is
you're often dealing with a direct competitor. You're worried about
keeping your core technology to yourself,'' he said, and that
doesn't lead to true cooperation.
   The joint ventures involving Japanese companies are of
particular concern, Wyss said. Japanese companies have a history of
exporting technology from the United States and Europe to Japan.
They also have established a pattern of eventually taking over
joint ventures by buying out their partners.
   Eastern Europe presents another booming area for joint ventures
for major corporations. Besides the GE Hungarian deal, General
Motors plans to make cars under a venture with an East German
concern, Siemens said it will make industrial robots with an East
German counterpart and Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. plans to build cars
with a Hungarian firm.
   ``Any business that aspires to be a global business can't for
too long ignore a new market of that size and promise,'' said Paul
Lawrence, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
   For the reformist East European governments, ``joint ventures
are a critical part of their whole economic reform program,''
Lawrence said.
   As joint-venture agreements transcend national boundaries,
governments may be forced to devise new ways to police them.
   ``In the long run it means that countries are going to more
closely coordinate tax laws because as companies become more
multinational, they're going to gain a greater ability to tax shop
across national borders,'' Wyss said.
   Kobrin said governments also may seek restrictions on joint
ventures that risk spreading technology considered proprietary. But
he said that thinking may be outdated.
   ``Technology is inherently international,'' he said. ``I wonder
if in eight or 10 or 12 years you'll be able to talk about national
products or national technologies.''

   Blacks were rejected more than twice as often
as whites for home loans in the first half of 1989, a Treasury
Department official testified Wednesday.
   From the second half of 1988 to the first half of 1989, the
rejection rate for blacks rose from 23 percent to 29 percent,
Jerauld C. Kluckman told a Senate Banking subcommittee.
   During the same period, the rejection rate for whites rose from
11 percent to 13 percent, Kluckman told the subcommittee on
consumer and regulatory affairs. The panel is examining
discrimination in the mortgage lending industry.
   Kluckman, director of compliance programs at the Office of
Thrift Supervision, said the agency is ``concerned about these
changes.'' However, he cautioned against drawing too many
conclusions from the data.
   ``The differences in rejection rates, in and of themselves, do
not indicate that savings associations are discriminating on a
prohibited basis,'' he said. For example, the data in their present
state do not consider creditworthiness or the criteria set by
lenders.
   ``The significance of the differences cannot be ignored, but can
only be explored and explained through vigorous field examinations
that thoroughly analyze a given savings association's policies,
procedures, lending programs and critera,'' he said.
   Kluckman was one of several government witnesses at the hearing,
which was called by Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill. Kluckman's office,
which regulates the savings and loan industry, was the only witness
to have detailed data on refusals.
   The number of witnesses reflected the number of entities
involved in enforcing laws against lending discrimination:
Comptroller of the Currency, Housing and Urban Development, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve.
   Dixon and others expressed surprise that despite statistics
showing such a wide gap between loan approvals for blacks and
whites, not one case had been referred to the Justice Department.
   Witnesses said violations have been handled through
administrative channels.
   Assistant Housing Secretary Gordon H. Mansfield said that
situation could change. ``We are currently consulting with Justice
in one case,'' he said.
   Other reports have indicated a pattern of discrimination in
mortgage lending. A series of stories published by the The Atlanta
Constitution in 1988 showed that high-income blacks were rejected
more often than high-income whites.
   Kluckman said the Justice Department had written 64 Atlanta-area
lending institutions in the last year requesting information on
lending standards, policies and practices, as well as other data.

   Earnings for the nation's 500 largest service
companies dropped 12.3 percent in 1989, but it still was their
second most profitable year ever, Fortune magazine said in an
annual ranking released Wednesday.
   The report attributed the decline for the Fortune Service 500 to
drops in profitability among the biggest commercial banking, thrift
and retailing businesses.
   ``The drop might have been worse had the diversified service
companies and the diversified financial companies not done the
heavy lifting,'' the magazine wrote in an article about the
rankings that appear in its June 4 issue.
   Profits at the diversified service group, which includes
companies ranging from movie studios to waste processors, more than
doubled from a year ago, and rose nearly 12.1 percent for
diversified financial services.
   Fortune said the 500 biggest service companies earned a combined
$69.7 billion in 1989, down from a revised $79.5 billion a year
earlier.
   The 1988 figure originally was reported at $73.8 billion but was
revised upward because the magazine has begun including net income
for life insurers.
   Fortune's 34th annual Service 500 survey indicated profits
tumbled 60 percent to nearly $7 billion at the 100 largest
commercial banking companies while the 50 largest savings
institutions had a combined loss of $3.1 billion in contrast to a
profit of $1.2 billion a year earlier.
   The magazine said bad real estate loans and too many junk bonds
``left banks and thrifts pretty winded.''
   Profits dropped 45.5 percent to nearly $5 billion at the 50
biggest retailing companies which, the magazine wrote, were
``hobbled by both cautious consumer spending and their own suicidal
price wars.''
   The 50 biggest transportation companies also showed a profit
decline, dropping 14.7 percent to $4.67 billion in what the
magazine said reflected ``a bumpy ride among the major airlines.''
   In the plus column, the 100 biggest diversified service
companies posted a combined profit of $14.1 billion, more than
double the $6.34 billion earned a year earlier.
   Profits rose 12.1 percent to $14.1 billion at the 50 largest
diversified financial companies, 7.6 percent to $6.1 billion at the
50 biggest life insurance companies and 1.5 percent to $21.9
billion at the 50 biggest utilities.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which led the diversified
services companies in sales with $36.3 billion, earned $2.7
billion, its best showing since the Bell System breakup five years
earlier.
   Ranking behind New York-based AT&amp;T in sales were the wholesale
foods distributors Fleming Cos. of Oklahoma City and Super Valu
Stores of Eden Prairie, Minn.
   The top three commercial banking companies remained Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan Corp., both of New York, and BankAmerica Corp. of
San Francisco.
   There also were no changes in the top three spots among the
diversified financial companies. American Express Co. of New York
was followed by the Federal National Mortgage Association of
Washington, D.C., and Salomon Inc., the New York securities firm.
   H.F. Ahmanson of Los Angeles remained the top-ranked savings
institution, followed by Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly
Hills, Calif., and Calfed, based in Los Angeles.
   The biggest life insurance companies were Prudential of America,
based in Newark, N.J., followed by Metropolitan Life and Equitable
Life Assurance, both based in New York.
   Sears Roebuck and Co. of Chicago was the biggest retail company,
followed by K mart Corp. of Troy, Mich., and Wal-Mart Stores of
Bentonville, Ark.
   Among transportation companies, United Parcel Service of
Greenwich, Conn., was first, followed by AMR Corp., the Fort Worth,
Texas-based parent of American Airlines, which moved from third to
second place. UAL Corp., the Chicago-based parent of United
Airlines, fell to third place from second.
   GTE Corp., based in Stamford, was the largest utility, followed
by BellSouth of Atlanta and Bell Atlantic of Philadelphia. Bell
Atlantic displaced Nynex, based in New York, which fell to fourth.

   Share prices closed higher in London on Wednesday,
boosted by technical factors and improved sentiment among investors
about Britain's political and economic climate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up
8.9 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,221.1, substantially below its
high for the day of 2,237.1 but above its early-morning low of
2,213.2.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index finished up 8.2
points at 1,739.8. The 500-share index finished at 1,198.84, up
5.43.
   Volume was 460.6 million shares, slightly better than the 402.4
million shares that changed hands Tuesday.
   Dealers said bears helped buoy the market around midafternoon,
but a weak opening on Wall Street trimmed the advance.
   Some traders suggested that investors are taking a kinder look
at the stock market following a better-than-expected showing by the
incumbent Conservative Party in recent local government elections
and optimism about the pound's early entry into the European
Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism.
   Additionally, one dealer said some fresh buying was visible.

<HEAD>Mobil to Recycle Plastic Grocery Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp., one of the major producers of
plastic grocery bags, said Wednesday it will begin collecting and
recycling used bags from supermarkets across the country.
   The oil giant's Mobil Chemical Co. unit annually manufactures
over 5 billion of the 23 billion bags used by the nation's grocery
stores. Mobil said it will recycle the bags into plastic sacks and
other products made of polyethylene, such as plastic garbage cans.
   The first stores to participate in the program will be 244
Safeway markets in California, Nevada and Hawaii, which will begin
collecting bags sometime next month, said Greg Auth, business
manager of Mobil's grocery bags.
   Other chains are expected to join in as consumer concern over
the environment continues to mount.
   Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, and Sonoco
Products Co. manufacture more than half of the nation's plastic
grocery bags. Sonoco said it collects bags from 1,500 supermarkets
around the country. The bags are then sold to a separate company
for use in plastic tubing.
   Mobil Chemical spokesman John Lord said the compnay will begin
making presentations ``to all our customers'' in the coming weeks.
``We expect strong suport from supermarket chains across country,''
he said.
   The use of plastic grocery bags has mushroomed in less than a
decade. In 1982, just 5 percent of all grocery sacks were made of
plastic; today the figure is roughly 60 percent as more and more
supermarkets and shopkeepers opt for plastic bags, which are
inexpensive, strong and take up one-tenth the space of their
brown-paper counterparts.
   Lord said legislation pending in a number of municipalities that
would ban the use of plastic bags contributed to Mobil's move to
set up the program even though ``plastic grocery sacks contribute
very small volumes to the total waste stream.''
   The key to the program's success will be consumer participation.
Not only must consumers bring used bags to the supermarkets, but
the bags must be clean, Auth said. Dirty bags cannot be recycled as
easily, and it is time consuming to remove them from recycling bins.
   The bags will be recycled at four Mobil plants that handle
polyethylene products. The company said its researchers ``are
stepping up efforts to develop products that can contain greater
amounts of recycled materials.''

   Chrysler Corp. will invest $190
million to modernize three Indiana plants, the company said
Wednesday.
   Chrysler said it would spend $150 million to expand its Kokomo
transmission plant by 150,000 square feet and to buy equipment to
produce a new electronically controlled automatic transaxle for
1993 model cars.
   The company said it will spend about $28 million for equipment
at its New Castle machining and forge plant, while the rest will be
invested at the company's Kokomo casting plant for new die-cast
tooling.
   Construction at the transmission plant will begin this month and
be completed next February, Chrysler said. Full production of the
new transmission, called the A606, is scheduled for May 1992. The
factory also will continue making six other standard and automatic
transmissions.

   The energy futures market was mixed in fairly
heavy trading Wednesday, with prices of crude oil tumbling and
unleaded gasoline gaining ground.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, lost 56
cents to settle at $19.03 a 42-gallon barrel, after dropping 12
cents Tuesday.
   Other contract months also declined.
   James Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., attributed the
crude dropoff to a report by the American Petroleum Institute
showing a sharp rise in crude stocks. He said traders also were
concerned about an unconfirmed report that OPEC members had raised
their daily oil production levels to 23.9 million this month from
23.6 million in April.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries earlier agreed
to a quota of 22 million barrels a day.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.66 cent to
64.17 cents a gallon. The contract gained 0.54 cent Tuesday.
   Steel said traders were reacting to a reported drop in unleaded
gasoline stocks in the API report released late Tuesday, as well as
continued expectations of higher demand as Memorial Day weekend
nears.
   June wholesale heating oil, which lost 0.71 cent Tuesday,
declined 0.09 cent at 51.63 cents on the exchange.
   Natural gas for June delivery rose to $1.570 per 1,000 cubic
feet from $1.552 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Trustee Approves Bid for Delaware &amp; Hudson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy trustee for the Delaware &amp;
Hudson Railway has accepted a $25 million bid for the carrier from
Canadian Pacific Ltd. in a deal that drew praise Wednesday from
both companies.
   Under the agreement, Canadian Pacific will either run the
Delaware &amp; Hudson or underwrite its operation by trustee Francis P.
Dicello. Dicello has been overseeing its operation since February
while trying to sell the freight line, which runs from Montreal to
Washington and from Albany to Buffalo, N.Y.
   The Delaware &amp; Hudson, the nation's oldest continuously operated
railroad, filed in June 1988 for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors. It is about $100 million in debt.
   ``We believe that the selection of Canadian Pacific will provide
jobs for employees and ensure continued viable rail service and
that the price negotiated with other considerations provide a basis
upon which a reorganization plan can be negotiated with a fair
return to creditors,'' said Delaware &amp; Hudson President C.P. Belke.
   Canadian Pacific, which owns 14,000 miles of track in Canada and
5,000 in the U.S., said the sale was an investment opportunity in
light of relaxed trade barriers between the United States and
Canada.
   ``Certainly under the free trade agreement, we can see some
major benefits,'' said spokesman John Cox. ``It allows us to
operate one of the largest market segments in the Northeast.''
   A hearing on the proposed sale is scheduled for June 7 in
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The sale is subject to
approval by federal and state authorities and the Delaware &amp;
Hudson's labor unions.
   Canadian Pacific's $25 million bid is $10 million less than it
offered earlier this year. The carrier withdrew that bid Feb. 13
when it was unable to negotiate with Consolidated Rail Corp. to
secure track rights between Hagerstown, Md., and Harrisburg, Pa.
   ``Conrail toughed it out and just wouldn't budge so they're
going to do the deal without it and compete in other arenas,'' said
Charles White, an attorney working with Dicello to sell the line.
   The proposed deal includes rolling stock, 600 miles of track and
an additional 900 miles to which the railroad has running rights.
   The agreement also allows the trustee to sell easements for
fiber-optic cables along the Delaware &amp; Hudson rights-of-way, White
said. He said the rights are worth about $5 million.

<HEAD>Dollar Settles Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed mostly lower on world currency
markets Wednesday in light trading.
   Gold prices retreated after rising overseas. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at
$369 a troy ounce, off $1.90 from late Tuesday. Republic National
Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $369.05 an ounce,
down $1.20.
   Traders said the dollar was barely affected by fresh government
data pointing to slow economic growth and moderate inflation. The
government said consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2
percent in April while housing starts were down a
larger-than-expected 5.8 percent.
   The figures were ``enough to weaken the dollar, but it has not
gone down that much,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at
Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   There was a feeling in the market that the dollar had bottomed
out for the time being, traders said. Some noted that they were
unable to push the dollar below 150 Japanese yen, which proved to
be a ``formidable barrier,'' Johnson said.
   Most market participants were awaiting Thursday's release of
merchandise trade data for March to confirm their suspicions that
the dollar is headed lower. The expectation is for a deficit of
between $7.7 billion and $8.5 billion. February's deficit totaled
$6.49 billion.
   A large deficit is negative for the dollar. When the United
States imports more than it exports, it diminishes the need for
dollars by foreigners to purchase U.S. goods. But over time a weak
dollar helps the trade picture by making U.S. goods more
competitive overseas.
   Still, some traders were predicting little reaction whatever the
trade report bears because ``all the bad news has already been
built in,'' said Kevin Lawrie, vice president and manager of the
Bank of Boston's New York office.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.95 Japanese yen, up
from 151.30 yen Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar traded lower
at 151.33 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 151.67 yen, up
from 150.83 yen Tuesday.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.6805 from Tuesday's late
$1.6775. In New York, one pound fetched $1.6805, more expensive
than $1.6725 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.6450 West German marks, down from 1.6465;
1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3980; 5.5460 French francs, down
from 5.5540; 1,210.00 Italian lire, down from 1,211.75, and 1.1751
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1770.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.6431 West German marks, down from 1.6467; 1.3990
Swiss francs, up from 1.3977; 5.5410 French francs, down from
5.5480; 1.8505 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8476; 1,208.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,210.50, and 1.1756 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1808.
   In overseas precious metals markets, gold traded at a late bid
price of $370.00 a troy ounce in London, up from $367.75. The
closing bid price in Zurich was $369.85, up from $367.50. Gold
closed in Hong Kong at $369.95 bid, up from $368.10.
   Silver prices eased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current deliver settled at $5.010 a troy ounce, off slightly from
Tuesday's $5.012. In London the metal traded at a late bid price of
$5.05 a troy ounce, down from $5.07.

<TEXT>
   A steep hike in health care costs was a major
contributor to a modest rise in inflation last month, the
government said Wednesday
   Overall, consumers received their first break since a cold snap
sent prices soaring at the beginning of the year. But that news was
tempered by the fact that health care costs skyrocketed 0.8 percent
in April. It was the third increase at that level, according to the
Labor Department's Consumer Price Index.
   Health care costs were up 8.9 percent from a year ago.
   The government said declines in the cost of vegetables, fuel oil
and women's clothing offset the higher healthcare costs to restrain
the overall increase. The rise in the Consumer Price Index was held
to a seasonally adjuted 0.2 percent in April, the most modest gain
in seven months.
   ``We're correcting from the unusually high prices of the
winter,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State
University in Atlanta. ``... You could argue the worst of inflation
is behind us, certainly for this year.''
   The index, spurred by weather-related increases in food and
energy prices, soared 1.1 percent in January and climbed 0.5
percent in February and March.
   The earlier price spurt, along with a burst of economic activity
fueled by unseasonably warm weather following the freeze, had
persuaded many analysts that the economy was breaking free of the
sluggishness of late 1989.
   However, the latest inflation report fits with recent
employment, retail sales and industrial production figures that
show a return to slow growth in April.
   Separately Wednesday, the Commerce Department said new housing
construction fell sharply for the third month in a row, plummeting
5.8 percent in April to the lowest level since the 1982 recession.
   ``The economy has not fundamentally changed. It remains weak and
inflation is not a threat. We expect more of that to come,'' said
David A. Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y.
   Interest rates, reacting to the evidence of quiescent inflation
and anemic economic growth, inched lower in early trading on the
bond market and stocks rose slightly. Both markets, however,
quickly reversed and analysts were at a loss to explain.
   Some suggested that market participants were looking beyond the
April inflation figure to the fact that inflation for the first
four months of the year was running at a 6.8 percent annual rate,
up from 4.6 percent for all of 1989.
   In April, food and beverage prices fell 0.2 percent, the first
decline since July 1987. Non-alcoholic beverage and dairy product
prices were down, while prices rose for cereal and bakery products,
beef, pork, sweets and oils.
   Fresh vegetable prices, which rose 29.2 percent in the first two
months of the year, fell 15.5 percent last month, bringing the
decline for March and April to 19.8 percent.
   Energy prices dropped 0.4 percent after declining the two
previous months. Gasoline prices, with the start of the warm
weather driving season, climbed 0.3 percent and electricty costs
were up 0.2 percent. However, fuel oil fell 0.6 percent, the third
consecutive decline, while natural gas dropped 3.0 percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
moderate 0.2 percent after increasing a worrisome 0.7 percent in
March. Economists said that ``core'' number was often a better
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   New automobile prices fell 0.2 percent in April. Clothing price
inflation moderated from a month earlier. Apparel prices overall
were unchanged after rising 1.7 percent in March.
   Women's and girls' clothing costs fell 0.5 percent. However,
men's and boys' clothing costs were up 0.4 percent while infants'
and toddlers' costs rose 1.9 percent.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
128.9 in April. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $128.90 last month, up
from $123.10 a year earlier.
   Separately, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased 0.2 percent last
month. However, over the past year, real weekly earnings were down
1.7 percent.
   So far this year, wholesale prices as measured by the Producer
Price Index have recovered from the winter weather shocks much more
swiftly than consumer prices. As a result, wholesale prices for the
first four months of the year have risen at a more moderate annual
rate of 4.2 percent.
   Analysts attribute the slower recovery of consumer prices to the
heavy influence of the service sector, which accounts for slightly
more than 50 percent of the consumer index and none of the
wholesale index.
   The economic slowdown of recent months has slowed demand for
goods, pulling down wholesale costs. But until very recently it
hadn't affected employment.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Surge on Drop in Belly Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices soared Wednesday after a report showed an
unexpected drop in pork belly stocks, sparking speculation that the
hog and belly markets will resume a sizzling rally that suffered a
setback last week.
   On other commodity markets, cattle futures also advanced; cocoa
and coffee futures surged; precious metals retreated; oil futures
were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Hog futures settled .25 cents to the permitted daily limit of
1.5 cents higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with the
contract for delivery in June at 65 cents a pound.
   Frozen pork belly futures ended 1.47 cents to the limit 2 cents
higher with May at 64.22 cents a pound.
   In cattle futures trading on the Merc, live cattle settled .15
cent to .87 cent higher with June at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .63 cent higher with May at 84.75 cents a
pound.
   Analysts said the cattle rally reflected spillover buying
enthusiasm from the adjacent pork pits.
   Pork futures generally have been in an upward trend since late
February, partly due to a decline in hog slaughters that defied
normal seasonal patterns.
   Wednesday's rally appeared to be rooted in the Merc's weekly
report Tuesday on belly stocks in commercial freezers outside of
Chicago. The report showed a net decline of 199,000 pounds instead
of the expected increase of up to 1.5 million pounds.
   The report was startling, according to Charles Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``I don't recall it ever having occurred,'' he said.
   Pork bellies are the part of a hog from which bacon is made. But
with hog slaughters declining on a year-to-year basis, Levitt said
meat packers also are using bellies in hot dogs and pork sausages.
   Meanwhile, rising hog prices have made it profitable for
producers to fatten up their animals a bit more before marketing
them, which is contributing to the slower slaughter pace, analysts
said.
   Hog prices normally reach an annual peak in mid-summer.
   Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., said market
sentiment is divided between those who think the rally already is
at or near its peak and those who believe hog futures will exceed
the record high of 68 cents a pound reached on Aug. 20, 1982.
   ``Those people sure came out of the woodwork today,'' Morgan
said.
   Cocoa futures climbed to their highest levels in nearly 14
months on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid news of
new anti-government protests by soldiers in the Ivory Coast, the
world's largest cocoa producer.
   Cocoa settled $35 to $38 higher with the July contract at $1,433
per ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contract
since March 22, 1989.
   Coffee futures also rose sharply in New York amid reports that
Colombia had moved to tighten coffee exports.
   Coffee settled 1.2 cents to 2.33 cents higher with May at 93.63
cents a pound.
   Inflation-sensitive precious metal futures fell on New York's
Commodity Exchange after the government reported a moderate 0.2
percent rise in consumer prices in April.
   Gold futures settled $1.90 to $2.40 lower with June at $370.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.5 cent lower with May at $5.01
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures were mixed in fairly heavy trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange with prices of near-term crude oil
deliveries tumbling and unleaded gasoline gaining ground.
   The action followed Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum
Institute stocks report showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude
stocks and a surprising drop in gasoline supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents lower to .04
cent higher with June at $19.03 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent
to .23 cent lower with June at 51.63 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent lower to .66 cent higher with June at 64.17
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices steadied Wednesday after a three-day
sell-off but corn futures retreated, extending the steep losses
posted in the previous session. Wheat prices were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents lower to 6 cents higher with May
up 6 cents at $3.89 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower
with May at $3.82{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 2} cents lower
with May at $1.54 a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 1} cents
higher with May at $6.13 a bushel.

<HEAD>Cable TV Giant Reports Wider Loss in 1st Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest
cable television system operator, said Wednesday its loss for the
first quarter widened to $57 million despite a 31.5 percent
increase in revenue.
   TCI said its loss amounted to 16 cents per share in the three
months ended March 31 compared with a net loss of $51 million, or
14 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $861 million from $655 million a year earlier.
   Operating income in the first quarter rose 21.2 percent to $165
million from $130 million for the same period a year ago.
   The company said revenue from cable operations increased 39
percent from a year ago because of growth in subscribers, charges
for service and advertising revenue. The company said theater
operations rose 5 percent due to increases in ticket prices.
   But higher interest costs due to acquisitions reduced results.

<HEAD>AMR's Crandall Outlines Problems Facing Airline Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Problems ranging from government
interference to rising fuel and labor costs threaten to slow growth
of the world's airline industry and raise fares, the head of the
largest U.S. carrier said Wednesday.
   ``We must keep in mind that if the many factors pushing up our
costs are not restrained, they may have the effect of pushing up
prices sufficiently to curb the demand on which our future
depends,'' Robert L. Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp., told
stockholders at the company's annual meeting. AMR is the parent of
American Airlines.
   Other challenges cited by Crandall were the need for new
equipment and terminals and tougher standards for safety and
efficiency.
   Crandall said fares would have to rise to pay the bill for
meeting the industry's various challenges.
   ``We must charge fares to give us sufficient revenue to pay for
the airplanes, pay for the facilities, pay for increases in
compensation that our people want, pay for the improved maintenance
procedures, pay for all of the improved things that people want
from the airline system,'' Crandall told reporters later.
   American is pushing an international expansion program, but
Crandall said foreign governments' control of landing rights make
it difficult to crack those markets.
   Domestically, ``we are also bedeviled by a shortage of airspace
and airport capacity, a problem that has been with us for far too
long,'' Crandall said. ``As a result, we have too few controllers,
too few airports, inefficient airspace management and inadequate
planning for the future,'' he added.
   As for the future of AMR itself, Crandall declined to forecast
when the company would begin to benefit from a $21 billion,
five-year expansion plan or whether the company's financial
performance would improve this year.
   AMR reported a $19.3 million loss in the first quarter of 1990,
its first loss in more than two years. The loss followed two
quarters of lower earnings.
   ``We very consciously avoid making any specific forecast,''
Crandall said.
   During the meeting, stockholders re-elected the company's
directors and rejected three shareholders resolutions that would
set minimum stock ownership requirements for directors, changed the
way shares are counted in directors' elections and allowed
confidential voting by shareholders.

<HEAD>Lettering-Machine Maker Files for `Prepackaged' Bankruptcy
Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lettering-machine maker Kroy Inc. and a European
subsidiary have filed a rare prepackaged reorganization proposal
the company says will avoid the ``death spiral'' delays typical of
such filings.
   The Chapter 11 petition in federal Bankruptcy Court seeking
protection from creditors while allowing Kroy to continue to
operate lists assets of $50 million and liabilities of $53 million.
   It includes Kroy Europe Ltd. and has the approval of some of its
major creditors, the company said Wednesday in announcing its
filing.
   It also proposes sale of a substantial portion of its equity to
Minneapolis-based Red Oak Investments, Kroy said. A smaller portion
will be sold to Kroy's existing equity security holders. No details
were disclosed.
   Kroy President Howard Klemmer said the Scottsdale-based company
ran into a cash-flow problem after it incurred a $60 million debt
in a 1986 leveraged buyout by its management.
   Operating profits have had to be funneled into debt payment, he
said, producing a severe cash flow problem limiting research,
development and marketing.
   Klemmer said the prepackaged bankruptcy technique is relatively
new and allows the court to view documents and confirm the
reorganization plan in the shortest period of time. Usually, the
plan is submitted to the court months after the initial filing.
   ``Typically what would happen in a Chapter 11 case is the
company files for protection and goes through 120 days where they
file a reorganization plan,'' Klemmer said. ``People lose faith in
the company, employees become discouraged and the company suffers.
It's a death spiral.''
   The Arizona Biltmore, a Phoenix resort, filed a prepackaged
reorganization plan in February and had it approved a month later.
   Kroy said its approval was likely to take longer because the
company hadn't yet reached agreement with all its creditors.
   Klemmer took over Kroy in October in attempt to dig the company
out of its financial problems.
   The company, which has 120 employees at its Scottsdale
headquarters, was sued last year by the U.S. Department of Labor
for hurting its employee stock-ownership plan with the buyout. The
reorganization plan addresses that issue as well, Klemmer said.
   Kroy was formed as United Fabricators and Electronics Inc. in
1963 as a spinoff from Plastics Corp. of America. In 1969 it
changed its name to Kroy and began selling lettering machines in
1973 along with a wide variety of labeling, lettering and other
printing products.
   It has 400 dealers and distributors worldwide.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Ruling Likely Will Crimp Regulators in Bank Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruling likely will
crimp regulators' ability to save the government money when a bank
owned by a holding company fails, attorneys said Wednesday.
   The decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans,
challenges the Federal Reserve Board's ``source of strength''
doctrine, which required holding companies to pump money into banks
they owned if the institutions weakened.
   The court said the Fed had no authority to force MCorp, a
Dallas-based bank holding company, to inject capital into 20
banking subsidiaries that later failed.
   Regulators declared the 20 subsidiaries insolvent in March 1989,
leaving MCorp with five solvent banks. The estimated cost of
bailing out depositors at the failed banks is $2 billion, making it
the second-largest commercial bank rescue ever.
   Stephen Verdier, an attorney with the Independent Bankers
Association of America, said the ruling in effect makes one-way
barriers of the ``firewall'' restrictions between a bank and its
holding company.
   Bank profits can be transferred in the normal course of business
to the holding company. But if the bank gets in trouble, the
holding company now will be able to choose whether to support the
bank or let it fail and have federal deposit insurance pay the
bill, he said.
   ``I think the regulators have a problem,'' said Verdier, whose
organization represents smaller community banks. ``...In theory, a
bank could upstream its profits to the holding company and then
later on the bank could fail and the holding company and its
non-bank affiliates could wash their hands.''
   The Fed, in policy directives in 1984 and 1987, had said ``a
bank holding company shall serve as source of financial and
managerial strength to its subsidiary banks'' and ``should stand
ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds
to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or
adversity.''
   However, the appeals court said, Congress granted the Fed
authority to issue capital directives only to banks, not to their
holding companies.
   ``It is not our role to pass judgment on the wisdom of the
scheme Congress put in place to regulate bank holding companies.
Similarly, the board cannot exceed the authority Congress granted
to correct perceived flaws in the congressional scheme,'' Judge W.
Eugene Davis, who wrote the decision for the three-judge appeals
panel.
   Ruling in the Fed's favor ``would require MCorp to disregard its
own corporation's separate status ... (and) amount to ... (a)
violation of its duty to its shareholders,'' Davis said.
   Attorney James McLaughlin of the American Bankers Association
said the ruling puts stockholders in bank holding companies on the
same footing as shareholders in other financial services companies.
It should help bank holding companies attract investors, he said.
   ``From a broad policy perspective, it's necessary to provide the
incentives to get capital in there'' to bank holding companies,''
McLaughlin said.
   Congress had considered explicitly enacting the
source-of-strength doctrine into law as part of S&amp;L bailout
legislation passed last summer. However, it rejected that and
adopted a provision requiring banks, but not the holding company
itself, to help the government bail out affiliate banks.
   Verdier predicted Congress would have to settle the
source-of-strength question next year when it considers legislation
to reform the deposit insurance system and revamp the financial
system.
   The appeals court, in releasing its ruling Tuesday, upheld a
June 1989 decision by Judge Lynn N. Hughes of the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Texas.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to throw out charges
against a psychiatrist accused of using confidential information
from a patient to make a profitable stock deal involving
BankAmerica Corp. securities.
   The decision Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum
revealed for the first time that the patient was the wife of
Primerica Corp. Chief Executive Sanford I. Weill, who was involved
in a 1986 attempt to head BankAmerica.
   The indictment against the psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis,
identified the patient only as ``Jane Doe.''
   Willis is accused of using non-public information about Weill's
negotiations with BankAmerica obtained during consultations with
Joan Weill to make a $27,475 profit in transactions involving
BankAmerica stock.
   The psychiatrist allegedly bought BankAmerica stock between Jan.
14, 1986 and Feb. 6, 1986, and then sold it after a public
announcement on Feb. 21, 1986, about Weill's attempts to become
chief executive.
   Weill at the time was chief executive of the Wall Street firm
Shearson, Loeb Rhoades, since integrated into Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Weill was unsuccessful in his bid to join BankAmerica. Neither
Weill nor BankAmerica was charged with any wrongdoing.
   The indictment, filed last August, charged Willis with 23 counts
of securities fraud and 23 counts of mail fraud.
   Willis, 55, of Tenafly, N.J., has an office on Manhattan's Upper
East Side.
   Cedarbaum rejected arguments by Willis' lawyers seeking to
dismiss the securities fraud charges because Willis had not been
accused of breaching a duty to a ``market participant or to any
participant in the corporate world.''
   ``By not advising his patient of his intention to disclose her
confidential information and to profit personally from it, Dr.
Willis fraudulently induced his patient to confide in him in
connection with his purchase and sale of securities,'' the judge
said in a written opinion.
   Cedarbaum also dismissed new arguments raised by Willis' defense
since an appeals court on May 2 reversed the securities fraud
conviction of former stockbroker Robert Chestman.
   In that decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found
that Chestman did not know that information he received about the
imminent sale of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain was confidential
when he traded on it.
   ``Dr. Willis knew that he was receiving the information in
confidence ... and that by disclosing and using the information for
his personal benefit, he was breaching the duty of trust and
confidence that he owed to his patient,'' she said.
   No trial date for Willis has been set.

<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food, liquor
and restaurant conglomerate, reported Wednesday a 38 percent jump
in operating profit in the first half of its fiscal year, due
largely to the contribution of its Pillsbury unit.
   Grand Met said it earned 282 million pounds, or the equivalent
of $457 million, in the six months ended March 31, compared with
205 million pounds, or $332 million, in the same period a year
earlier.
   One-time gains of 499 million pounds, or $808 million, from the
sale of the company's William Hill and Mecca betting operations,
boosted net income to 781 million pounds, or $1.27 billion, in the
latest six months. In the year-earlier period, one-time gains of
518 million pounds, or $839 million, made net income 723 million
pounds, or $1.17 billion.
   Sales rose to 4.97 billion pounds, or $8.05 billion, from 4.04
billion pounds, or $6.54 billion.
   The company did not break out its quarterly results. British
companies are not required to do so.
   Sales volume in the company's U.S. food operations, which
includes Pillsbury, was particularly strong, the company said.
Grand Met acquired Pillsbury, including the U.S. firm's Burger King
fast-food operations, for $5.7 billion in late 1988 but it was not
included in last year's first-half figures.
   ``The performance of the Pillsbury Co., including Burger King,
has reinforced our conviction that the acquisition will be
earnings-positive in its first full financial year,'' said Grand
Met Chairman Allen Sheppard.
   Pillsbury's income rose 150 percent, Grand Met said, although it
did not report a separate figure for the company. Total income for
the conglomerate's U.S. food businesses doubled to 103 million
pounds, or $167 million.
   Burger King earned 53 million pounds, or $96 million, up from 14
million pounds, or $23 million, a year earlier. Grand Met said the
unit's profitability was boosted by volume gains and cost controls.
   In retailing, which includes Burger King as well as Grand Met's
European restaurants and pubs and Pearle optical goods, income rose
66 percent on a 59 percent increase in sales.
   Results at British pubs and restaurants were damped by a
slowdown in the British economy, the company said.
   Analysts said the report held no surprises, except that property
sales were above some expectations. The new Pillsbury operations
were expected to perform well, while the big British restaurant and
beer retailing business was bound to be slowed by sluggish consumer
demand, they noted.

   The stock market backed away a bit Wednesday
from the record highs of the past couple of sessions while traders
assessed the latest inflation statistics.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 0.92 Tuesday to its
second straight closing high, dropped 2.77 to 2,819.68.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
701 up, 814 down and 517 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.81 million
shares, against 165.73 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 197.68 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported Wednesday morning that the
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in April, compared to 0.5
percent increases in the two preceding months.
   Analysts said that reinforced recent evidence that inflation was
not reviving to the extent that traders had feared through much of
the winter and early spring.
   At the same time, they said, the market seemed largely to have
anticipated the news with its rise to record highs earlier in the
week.
   It appeared that investors now are looking for signs that
inflationary pressures and interest rates can continue their recent
decline.
   Rates edged upward in the credit markets Wednesday, pushing
yields on long-term Treasury bonds to the 8.63 percent-8.68 percent
range.
   Hewlett-Packard dropped 1~ to 46&lsqb; in active trading. The company
reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter ended April 30 of
78 cents a share, down from 86 cents in the comparable period a
year earlier.
   Other losers among the blue chips included American Express,
down 1&rsqb; at 29\; International Business Machines, down \ at 115&rsqb;;
General Electric, down &lsqb; at 68&lsqb;, and Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at 44{.
   Circle K tumbled ~ to 1&lsqb;. The convenience-store operator filed
late Tuesday for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal

   Sotheby's Holdings climbed 1\ to 18| after a record $82.5
million sale of a Van Gogh painting Tuesday night eased fears of a
slump in the art market. The auction took place at the New York
office of Christie's, a British competitor.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded issues, the stock market lost $0.33 billion, or
0.01 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .17 to 193.14.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .34 to 411.52, and S&amp;P's

   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday its
profit slipped 8 percent in its second fiscal quarter as some of
its product lines struggled in the marketplace.
   After-tax profit in the quarter ended April 30 totaled $186
million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $3.3 billion. That
compared with earnings of $203 million, or 86 cents a share, on
revenue of $2.9 billion in the same 1989 period.
   The most recent quarter includes results from Apollo Computer,
which Hewlett-Packard acquired in May 1989.
   ``This was another quarter of mixed results,'' John A. Young,
president and chief executive officer of the computer products and
systems manufacturer, said in a statement. ``Orders were uneven
across our product lines.''
   Orders for medical products dropped, while many other lines
showed only slight growth in the quarter, he said.
   Hewlett-Packard's effort to control operating costs was masked
somewhat by one-time costs from an early retirement program started
in January, the company said.
   About 780 U.S.-based employees left the company through March 30
under the program, contributing to a worldwide reduction of more
than 1,000 people from the 94,000-member work force.
   Young said he was encouraged by sales of Hewlett-Packard's new
minicomputers, introduced in January, and the company's LaserJet
printers.

pasta maker, with $658 million in sales last year.
   It said it will spend $20 million on the plant in Jackson,
Miss., which will process or package individual portions of
products such as ketchup, mayonnaise and cream, along with
bulk-sized oil-based products, including mayonnaise, salad dressing
and syrup.
   Borden expects 1990 sales in its food service segment to reach
$600 million.
   R.J. Ventres, Borden's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the projects are part of a plan to build 11 large-scale food
plants in the next few years. Borden already has four such pasta
plants, and plans another in Canada.

<HEAD>Former Kenner Chief To Head Fisher-Price</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald J. Jackson, a former president and chief
executive of Kenner Parker Toys Inc., is returning to the toy
business as chairman, president and CEO of Fisher-Price, officials
announced Wednesday.
   Jackson is leaving as president and chief executive officer of
Stride Rite Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., to take the new post.
   His appointment to the top job at Fisher-Price became effective
immediately, said the toymaker's parent company, Quaker Oats Co.
   Chicago-based Quaker last month announced plans to spin
Fisher-Price off to its shareholders as an independent company.
   Fisher-Price is the world's biggest maker of infant and
pre-school toys and is based in East Aurora, N.Y. The business
suffered an 11 percent drop in operating income during the fiscal
year that ended last June and had an operating loss of about $25
million in the most recent quarter.
   Toy industry analysts have blamed Fisher-Price's problems on a
costly, poorly planned attempt to develop toys for older children.
   Quaker Chairman William D. Smithburg expressed confidence
Jackson can turn the company around.
   ``Ron Jackson's background as a toy company executive and
especially his experience in heading a newly independent, publicly
traded Kenner Parker Toys from 1985 to 1987 makes him ideally
suited to lead Fisher-Price during this very important period,''
Smithburg said in a statement.
   Quaker has said it hopes to complete a tax-free distribution of
Fisher-Price stock to Quaker shareholders by the first quarter of
1991.
   Jackson, 46, said the appointment represented a great
opportunity.
   ``I know from experience how highly regarded Fisher-Price is in
the toy industry, and despite its recent performance, this company
has what it takes to bounce back and succeed,'' he said in a
statement.
   Paul E. Price, a senior vice president of Quaker who served as
interim president of Fisher-Price since January, will return to his
duties at Quaker, Smithburg said.
   Jackson worked for Parker Brothers and its parent, General Mills
Inc., from 1974 to 1985, when he left the company. He returned as
president and CEO of Kenner Parker Toys in 1985 following General
Mills' decision to spin off the division to its shareholders.
   Tonka Corp. bought Kenner Parker in late 1987, and Jackson
served as a consultant with Tonka from that point until October
1988.
   At Stride Rite, Chairman Arnold Hiatt will assume the post of
chief executive for the time being, a position he held in the past,
the company said. The footwear maker's brands include Keds and
Top-Siders.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3: ``In another,'' and 11-13: ``Massachusetts
politicians,'' on plans dropped for Georges Bank leasing. Also on

   President Bush said Wednesday he is close to
deciding whether to recommend new oil and gas exploration off the
coasts of California and Florida, and indicated the nation's
dependence of foreign oil will influence his decision.
   Members of Congress who met with Bush, who pioneered offshore
drilling in his days in the oil business, said he did not tip his
hand but asked many questions about the nation's energy needs.
   In another development, the Interior Department told
Massachusetts members of Congress it did not intend to offer leases
on Georges Bank, a prime fishing ground off Cape Cod.
   In a news conference Wednesday Bush mentioned his previously
stated concerns about environmental protection in the Florida Keys,
which he called ``a highly sophisticated and sensitive area.''
   ``And so I've already said that, but I don't want to suggest
that I don't feel that way about certain areas off California,'' he
added.
   His mention of ``certain areas off California'' could mean he
wants to block new drilling in some but not all of the two study
areas _ one in northern California and one in Southern California _
that, along with Southern Florida, have been under review by an
administration task force.
   The task force, including Cabinet members and top aides who met
separately with Bush on Wednesday, has presented Bush with a series
of options on how the matter might be handled, administration
officials say.
   No matter what Bush decides, much of the waters off California
and Florida have been closed to drilling by Congress until Sept. 30
through a provision in an appropriations bill, as they often were
throughout the 1980s.
   In the 1980s, environmentalists persuaded appropriations
subcommittees that the risks of drilling were too great. The loss
of 11 millions of gallons of crude oil from the Exxon Valdez in
Alaska's Prince William Sound in March 1989 reinforced their
arguments, according to many in Congress.
   But Bush already had promised in the 1988 campaign to look into
the offshore drilling issue.
   Massachusetts politicians had protested that drilling on Georges
Bank _ now believed to contain gas, not oil _ posed too much danger
to the fish and the livelihoods of the crews who harvest them.
   Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., provided documents sent him by Barry
Williamson, director of the Minerals Management Service in the
Interior Department, indicating no lease offerings there before
1993, which would mean no drilling could take place before 1996.
   ``The possiblity of drilling on Georges Bank is now very, very
remote,'' Atkins said.
   Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, in a twist on the coastal
protection views held by many in the state's delegation, told
reporters after meeting with Bush that he would not oppose all new
drilling in Southern California, which was usually omitted from
annual congressionally mandated drilling bans in the 1980s.
   ``I doubt there are any places in Northern California where
there should be any oil drilling but there might well be some off
the coast of Southern California to the far south and way out at
sea. It should not be close to the shore,'' he said.
   Pressed on where he was talking about, the senator told
reporters he had no specific suggestions, but that it should be
``at least 25 miles off shore.''
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who has differed with the Bush
administration by insisting on no new drilling off California,
seemed surprised at Cranston's statement.
   ``We are facing a situation where there is relatively little
oil, where there is not enough to warrant a substantial risk,''
said Wilson, who is a candidate for governor in the environmentally
conscious state.
   He said Bush in the meeting with Congress members ``said very
little; he listened.''
   He and other members said Bush seemed most interested in hearing
about how he can balance the nation's energy needs against
environmental protection and decrease dependence on foreign oil.
   According to the American Petroleum Institute, the principal
trade group, 49 percent of the nation's oil came from abroad in the
first quarter of 1990 compared with 44 percent in the same period
of 1989.

<HEAD>Western Union Quarterly Losses Increase Tenfold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. said its
losses widened sharply in the first three quarter as the booming
trade in facsimile transmissions cut into its profitable Telex
business.
   Increased debt service and costs of integrating its financial
services business also contributed to the loss, the company said
Wednesday.
   The company sid it lost $18.1 million on revenues of $145
million in the first three months of the year, compared with a loss
of $189,000 on revenues of $158 million in the first three months
of 1989.
   After deducting for undeclared dividends on preferred shares,
the latest loss amounted to 37 cents for each share of common
stock, compared with a loss of 32 cents a share in the first
quarter of 1989.
   The company had about twice as many common shares outstanding in
the latest period as a year earlier, spokesman Warren R. Bechtel
said. It hasn't paid a dividend since 1988, he added.
   Bechtel blamed the losses partly on mounting debt payments and
the cost of integrating the National Payments Network into the
Western Union system. The interest rate on $500 million in senior
secured notes was reset last June from 16.5 percent to 19.25
percent, he said.
   Western Union bought the National Payments Network in the summer
of 1989, he said. The system that lets utilities customers pay
bills through outlets in local stores.

<HEAD>Northrop to Eliminate 3,000 Jobs in Latest Blow to California
Aerospace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the latest body blow to California
aerospace, Northrop Corp. said Wednesday it would cut 3,000 jobs or
7 percent of its workforce by year end because of defense spending
cuts on its B-2 bomber.
   The radar-dodging, bat-winged stealth bomber made up 58 percent
of Northrop's $1.28 billion in first-quarter sales.
   As world tensions ease, however, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
has proposed cutting purchases of the bomber from 132 to 75. Peak
production would fall from 36 planes a year to 12.
   ``World events, government decisions, economic conditions, are
all evolving at a rapid rate _ at an unprecedented rate,'' Chief
Executive Kent Kresa said in announcing the cuts, which will be met
through layoffs and attrition.
   ``Questions are being asked about fundamental assumptions that
have not been questioned since many of us here were children,'' he
said in remarks prepared for Northrop's annual meeting Wednesday.
   Spokesman Tony Cantafio said 2,700 jobs will be lost in Southern
California. That follows news last week that McDonnell Douglas
Corp. would cut 4,000 jobs, mostly in Long Beach, and that Lockheed
Corp. would shut down in Burbank, eliminating 4,500 local jobs over
the next few years.
   The layoffs could create a ripple effect through the aerospace
industry, the greatest source of manufacturing jobs in the region.
Chamber of Commerce economist Jack Kyser said 70 percent of the
area's aerospace companies employ 50 or fewer workers. Kresa noted
that Northrop has 6,000 subcontractors and suppliers in the region.
   ``On our major programs today, Northrop as prime contractor is
responsible for only 30 or 40 percent of the work; 60 to 70 percent
is done by our subcontractors and suppliers,'' Kresa said. ``They
also will be among the first to feel the effects of budget
reductions and stretchouts.''
   Northrop's employment peaked at 48,200 at the end of 1987. It
cut 2,500 employees during the past year, and currently has about
41,000 workers.
   Kresa said Northrop can eliminate its $1 billion debt by the
mid-1990s through cost-cutting and sale of assets. The company made
an after-tax gain of $90 million and cut its short-term debt by
$218 million through the recent sale and partial leaseback of its
corporate headquarters complex.
   Northrop officials wouldn't say what assets might be sold.
   Kresa also set a goal for Northrop, which lost $63.5 million
last year, or returning to the 20 percent return-on-equity level it
achieved in the mid-'80s.
   ``I was impressed by his comments,'' said Lawrence Harris, a
securities analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los
Angeles. ``The 20 percent return-on-equity goal is certainly
ambitious, but it's the kind of target the Street would be looking
for on a long-term basis.''

   The state Department of Employment
Security said it will temporarily stop referring job applicants to
Nintendo of America while it examines claims that the company
discriminates against blacks.
   The Redmond-based video game-maker issued a statement denying
contentions by the Seattle Core Group that it discriminates. The
company ``has been and remains committed to equal opportunity
hiring and advancement of all employees,'' the statement said.
   The group contends that the company employs too few blacks _ 35
in a work force of 1,600.
   Nintendo said it had difficulty attracting minorities because of
its location, ``which is not well served by Metro buses during the
hours of our shift changes.'' The company said it was trying to
arrange better transportation.
   Redmond is a northeast Seattle suburb.
   The statement also said Nintendo will ``cooperate fully'' with
the Employment Security department. Commissioner Isiah Turner, who
ordered the suspension, will meet with Nintendo officials early
next week to discuss the issue, department spokesman John Welch
said.
   ``The suspension will be in effect at least until the
commissioner is satisfied that there is not any discrimination by
Nintendo,'' Welch said.
   Nintendo of America is the largest subsidiary of Nintendo Co.
Ltd. in Japan, the world's top producer of home video games.

<TEXT>
   First it was coupons, then double
coupons. Now two supermarket chains have gone sky high, offering
airline ticket discounts.
   In competing programs, the Lucky and Safeway store groups are
giving vouchers for reduced fares to customers who buy $100 in
groceries.
   ``They're offering generally the lowest fares on the market,''
said Jerry Sandlin, owner of a San Jose travel agency. ``It's great
for people who can't afford to pay full fare.''
   Lucky has teamed with Delta Air Lines for its discount program,
while Safeway is offering discounted TWA fares.
   For each $100 in groceries purchased (excluding alcohol, tobacco
and dairy products), a customer can obtain a voucher for a discount
on one fare. The limit is four discounts per family.
   Lucky's offer stands at all 393 stores in California, while
Safeway customers in Northern California and Nevada stores can
participate.
   Lucky's discount provides a fixed rate on any round-trip Delta
domestic flight, including Hawaii and the Caribbean. Prices are
$155 for West Coast states, $255 to anywhere else west of the
Mississippi, $275 to east of the Mississippi and $299 to Hawaii and
the Caribbean.
   Safeway's ads offer a 25 percent discount off TWA's regular fare
on ``almost every seat'' on domestic and international flights.
Safeway offered examples in a recent ad: A $358 round-trip flight
to New York discounted to $268, and a Miami round trip cut to
$223.50 from $298.
   The Safeway program, which started April 29, allows customers to
use their discount coupon anytime before Feb. 28, 1991, Safeway
spokeswoman Debra Lambert said. The coupons are transferable and
may be used at any U.S. city served by TWA.
   Lucky's receipts are not transferable and must be turned in for
a voucher by June 13. Flights must originate in one of 11
California cities.

   A former print shop worker and a stock broker
were found guilty of insider trading Wednesday for buying stocks
based on Business Week tips scooped from the magazine before it hit
the streets.
   William N. Jackson, 34, of Long Beach, a former quality control
analyst at a business that prints the magazine, faces up to $80,000
in penalties following the verdict by a civil jury. Former
Prudential-Bache broker Brian Callahan, 30, of Anaheim, faces up to
$110,000 in penalties.
   Neither the printing company nor Business Week were charged in
the case.
   Jackson reviewed a freshly printed copy of Business Week each
Wednesday night, then phoned Callahan the next morning to buy
stocks recommended in the magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column,
the government charged.
   Though printed on Wednesday nights, Business Week does not reach
newsstands until Thursday evening.
   The two men traded in 53 stocks between 1987 and 1988, the
government alleged. Jackson made more than $19,000 for himself and
two brothers, and Callahan made the same for himself and his
clients and $8,000 in commissions, it charged.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it will seek all the
profits, plus interest, and triple that amount in penalties. After
the verdict U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson froze the men's
assets.
   SEC lawyer Jeffrey Zuckerman praised the jury for its ``quick
and decisive verdict'' after the four-day trial. The jury
deliberated about an hour.
   ``I'm pleasantly surprised,'' Zuckerman said.
   The men's attorney, Joseph Connolly, argued the SEC was
``stretching the securities laws almost beyond recognition'' and
called the violations marginal.
   ``These are a couple of guys who lost their jobs,' he said.
``They're not wealthy, either of them.''
   Jackson acknowledged he bought stock but testified he didn't
realize he was breaking the law or confidentiality requirements of
his company, R.R. Donnelley and Sons of Torrance, Calif.
   Callahan testified he believed Jackson got his tips from a
computer program.
   The convictions were the latest developments in the government's
investigation of insider trading related to Business Week.
   In January, John Joseph Lynch agreed to pay more than $44,000 in
alleged illegal profits, interest and fines to the SEC to settle
charges that he traded on confidential information from advance
copies of the magazine. Lynch, who worked for the New Jersey
company that typesets the magazine, neither admitted nor denied
guilt.
   Previously, S.G. (Rudy) Ruderman, a former Business Week
broadcast editor, and William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
stockbroker, both pleaded guilty to trading on advance information
and were sentenced to six months in prison.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
operators of hundreds of new Boeing 737s to inspect the jetliners
after a steering wheel came off in a co-pilot's hands, Boeing said
Wednesday.
   The FAA issued a telegraphic airworthiness directive Wednesday
ordering immediate inspections of the co-pilot control columns on
the 378 most recent 737s built, said Mark Hooper, a spokesman for
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
   The directive orders the inspections within 72 hours and affects
737 models 300, 400 and 500 built over the past two years roughly,
Hooper said.
   Boeing told the FAA Monday that a steering wheel came off in a
co-pilot's hands during a flight, Hooper said. The plane landed
safely after the pilot took back control of the aircraft, he said.
   The spokesman refused to say what airline was involved or
whether it was a foreign or domestic carrier.
   KIRO Television reported that the incident occurred during a
test flight of a 737 that had just been delivered to a West German
airline. The station did not identify the airline.
   ``The pilot turned it over to the co-pilot,'' Hooper said of the
flight. ``The co-pilot obviously recognized the problem and the
pilot regained control of the plane and took it from there.''
   An investigation revealed the cotter pin was missing from the
bolt that attaches the steering wheel to the control column, and
the bolt's threads were damaged, Hooper said. Boeing inspected
several undelivered 737s on its flight line and found one other
plane with a cotter pin missing from the co-pilot's wheel, he said.
Inspectors are supposed to check that the in is in place, he added.
   ``I think we have to find out the degree to which the problem
exists and then trace some steps back to see where the problem
occurred or with what particular assembly,'' he said.
   The FAA directive orders the aircraft operators to inspect the
cotter pins visually, which Hooper said takes only a few seconds.
Airlines are to make any necessary repairs and report their
findings to the FAA within 48 hours of making checks.
   The 737 is the smallest and most popular jetliner made by
Boeing. It is a twin-engine, short-to-medium range aircraft
produced in the Seattle suburb of Renton. The model 300 can carry
as many as 141 passengers, the 737-400 can carry up to 159
passengers and the 737-500, the newest model, can seat 122.
