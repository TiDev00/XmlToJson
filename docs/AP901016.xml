   At a recent House Democratic leadership
meeting, lawmakers were asked to raise their hands if they were
eager to adjourn and hit the campaign trail back home. Nobody did.
   In fact, one member joked: ``We want to be held hostage here,
and don't pay any ransom,'' according to one official who attended
the closed-door session.
   The show of hands and the comment that followed were in a
lighthearted vein, but they spoke a serious truth: incumbents are
finding Washington a good place to ride out the election-season
budget storm.
   ``It's easier to campaign here, doing your work in Washington,
than out on the stump,'' said Rep. David Bonior, a Michigan
Democrat who faces a stiff re-election challenge. ``I prefer to be
doing my job, what the people sent me here to do.''
   This year there's a new survival strategy for incumbents: stay
in Washington, keep your nose to the grindstone, appear to be above
politics and stay in touch through television and radio advertising
and news coverage.
   It is a congressional variant of the Rose Garden strategy
sometimes used by incumbent presidents. Such an approach not only
keeps challengers at bay, but angry voters as well; members of
Congress can avoid the prospect of facing boos and angry
interrogation at live public events.
   Incumbents are not anxious to return home while the government
is in crisis, particularly when the government is being shut down
and President Bush is laying the blame on Congress.
   A measure of the public discontent came when vandals
spray-painted ``Cut Taxes, Deficit'' and ``Repeal - Stolen Pay
Raise'' on the house of House Republican Leader Robert Michel in
Peoria, Ill.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., bristled when asked Monday
about the budget standoff, another sign of the heat it has
generated for lawmakers.
   ``The president often takes the stance of standing aside as if
he's not a participant in these budget negotiations, as if it's
somehow a congressional activity,'' he said.
   Thumping his desk for emphasis, Foley added: ``It was the
presidential veto (earlier this month) that shut down the
government. He bears full responsibility for that, and he will bear
full responsibility'' if it happens again.
   The threat of another government shutdown this weekend, together
with a general anti-incumbent mood and a sparse list of
accomplishments for the 101st Congress, has made home a
less-than-hospitable place for lawmakers.
   ``They're pretty darn vitriolic,'' said a senior Midwestern
Republican. He said constituents were calling his office and
screaming epithets at his staff.
   A legislator whose image is beamed home in the televised House
floor proceedings might think, ``Shoot, I can make more points here
doing this,'' said the congressman, who requested anonymity. ``And
besides, if he's getting challenged to debate his opponent, it's a
good excuse not to.''
   That feeling is not universal. Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., who
many regard as among the most endangered incumbents this year, has
been thrashed by challenger Bob Hammock for missing important
budget votes while out campaigning.
   ``I can't be in both places at the same time, so I have to make
tough choices,'' Brown countered.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is running for governor of
California, also has been chastised for missing votes. His
Democratic opponent, Dianne Feinstein, said of Wilson: ``If he's
not going to do his duty, then he should resign his job in the
United States Senate.''
   In other cases, the campaigns have simply moved to Washington.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., and his Democratic challenger,
Paul Wellstone, held a debate Sunday night in a studio set up at
Washington's National Press Club. It was beamed back to Minnesota
by satellite.
   But those cases seem to be the exception, and the new mood is a
pronounced switch from past years. In 1986, Republicans blamed
their loss of the Senate on incumbents being held too long in
Washington and away from the campaign trail.
   One senior congressional official said there traditionally are
two schools of thought as Election Day approaches - those with
tight races who want to go home and campaign, and those who are not
threatened and say, ``What's the rush?''
   ``Now there's a third school of thought,'' the official said.
``Those who have a tough race, and say, `What's the rush?'''
   The official added: ``Until we finish the budget and a couple of
important pieces of legislation, we don't want to be adjourned.''

<HEAD>Senate Keeps Stealth Bomber Alive, Passes Defense Spending Bill</HEAD>

   Congressional proponents of the B-2 stealth
bomber are breathing easier after the Senate narrowly rejected an
attempt to stop production of the radar-evading aircraft.
   ``We had to have it,'' Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee and a B-2 proponent, said Monday
night after the Senate approved a $268 billion defense spending
bill.
   By a 50-44 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would
have halted production of the stealth aircraft at six planes - far
short of the 75 that President Bush is seeking at a cost of nearly
$865 million each.
   Backers of the Northrop-built bomber argued that a plane that
can penetrate Soviet air defenses is still needed because of
uncertainty over the future leadership of the Kremlin.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., also pointed out that a predecessor of the B-2 - the
B-1B bomber - has failed to meet Pentagon performance standards. He
urged his colleagues not to abandon the stealth capability.
   ``Opponents do not understand we're talking about revolutionary
technology,'' Nunn said.
   But the opponents complained that in the post-Cold War era, a
nation on the verge of economic ruin cannot afford to buy a bomber
geared toward the Soviet Union.
   ``There is a threat to the nation greater than the Soviet air
defense,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   Rejection of the amendment came as House and Senate negotiators
on a military authorization bill pushed to complete a final
blueprint for the current fiscal year, with the B-2 bomber the main
point of contention.
   Defeat of the B-2 in the Senate ``would have taken the big
thrust out of the argument for any continuation,'' said Rep. Bill
Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee.
   Shortly after the B-2 vote, the Senate overwhelmingly approved
the military spending package that meets the levels set forth in
the budget resolution approved by Congress.
   The legislation, adopted 79-16, trims about $1 billion from
Bush's $4.7 billion request for the Strategic Defense Initiative
and cuts the number of U.S. troops by 100,000, including 50,000 in
Europe.
   The spending bill also includes $238 million for the V-22
Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft Bush has sought to cancel during
the past two years; eliminates $1.1 billion the Pentagon sought for
the MILSTAR communications satellite and scales back the
administration's request for land-based nuclear missiles.
   The bill includes about $500 million for the MX missile and $200
million for the planned Midgetman missile as well as funds for one
SSN-21 Seawolf submarine.
   Negotiators for the Senate and the House, which had passed a
defense spending bill earlier, will meet to thrash out a final
version, with an aim to wrap up the legislation by week's end
before Congress adjourns for the year.

   If you're a college student, your school may
no longer be eligible for certain government-backed loans. If
you're a wheat farmer, your federal subsidies will shrink. If
you're a veteran, your benefits will be less generous.
   The deficit-reduction legislation Congress plans to vote on this
week will hit home all across America. And it's not only in the
bigger bite the Internal Revenue Service will take - although
that's likely to sting, too.
   Congressional votes on budget-cutting packages were expected to
begin as early as today. The competing measures aim at slicing the
federal deficit over the next five years by about $500 billion,
including $40 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The plans range from a measure written by House Democrats that
is top-heavy with higher taxes on the wealthy, to a House
Republican plan that slashes spending and relies only lightly on
new levies.
   In the Senate, the leaders of both parties are united behind a
package that would make the rich pay more but also would double the
gasoline tax.
   ``This is where members put their money where their mouth is,''
said the House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.
   The votes will be painful ones for members because just three
weeks from Election Day, they will be considering packages that
mean higher tax bills and reduced federal services for the public.
   The 33 million elderly and handicapped people enrolled in the
Medicare program will feel the pinch in several ways.
   The $75 they must pay each year in doctors' bills before the
government begins picking up the tab would increase to $150 next
year under the Senate bill, $100 under the House Democratic plan.
And the $28.60 they pay each month for doctors' coverage would
increase by 1995 to $46.50 monthly under the House Democratic plan,
$47 by 1995 in the Senate package.
   All Americans who are sick could see their bills increase
because the reimbursements doctors and hospitals receive for
treating Medicare patients will be held to below the rate of
inflation.
   With their federal reimbursements reduced, doctors and hospitals
could be forced to pass their costs on to all patients. The
government limits the ability of health care providers to boost
costs for Medicare recipients.
   Farmers also would be hit. Lawmakers would reduce acreage
eligible for crop subsidies by 15 percent for each farmer beginning
in 1992.
   And subsidies would be cut in another way: by changing the
formula by which farmers receive payments when market prices are
low. The five subsidized crops are wheat, corn, feed grains, rice
and cotton.
   Veterans would see many benefits restricted. They would no
longer be automatically considered disabled - and therefore
eligible for higher payments - at age 65. And they would have to
contribute $2 for prescriptions paid for by the government.
   The Guaranteed Student Loan program, which serves 3 million
students in colleges, graduate and technical schools, would also
have new limits. Loans would no longer be available at the
approximately 1,000 schools where more than 35 percent of past
loans have defaulted.
   The banks that make federally backed loans would receive
slightly less interest from the government, which probably would
make fewer loans availabl.
   And for all but the poorest Americans, the tax bite will get
deeper under the House Democratic plan, according to Congress'
Joint Committee on Taxation.
   People with incomes under $20,000 would see their taxes drop
slightly, but people earning more than $200,000 annually would have
to absorb a 7.4 percent increase. Americans in between would see
increases in the 1 percent range.
   The changes would be a result of higher taxes on alcohol and
tobacco; giving up next year's income tax adjustment to offset
inflation, and raising the amount of wages subject to the Medicare
tax.
   The Senate plan would reduce taxes slightly for people earning
less than $20,000; raise taxes by just under 3 percent for families
in the $20,000-to-$50,000 income range; increase them 1.9 percent
for those between $50,000 and $75,000 and boost them 3.5 percent
for those between $100,000 and $200,000. The $200,000-plus group
would pay 3.7 percent more.
   Other measures affecting consumers would:
   -End, for five years, the option that civil service retirees
have to receive their benefits in a lump sum. People over age 64
with 30 years of service would be exempted.
   -Impose a $1 fee on aircraft or ship passengers entering the
United States, including returning Americans, except for those
traveling from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean or U.S. possessions.
   -Increase U.S. Patent Office fees for items such as patent
applications.
   -Boost fines for violations of labor safety laws.

   Rock guitarist Carlos Santana has accused
the Miller Brewing Co. of mimicking without authorization his
rendition of ``Black Magic Woman'' in a TV commercial.
   The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Miller and its New York ad
agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., violated trademark law in the
commercial for Miller Lite Beer. Santana's lawyer, David Phillips,
said damages may surpass $1 million.
   The lawsuit claims the brewer knowingly used an ``imitation of
Santana's distinctive guitar playing.''
   Last year, singer Bette Midler was awarded $400,000 after suing
an advertising agency for using a soundalike in a 1986 car
commercial.
   Although Santana did not write ``Black Magic Woman,'' the
lawsuit said, the public considers it his ``theme song.'' Peter
Green of Fleetwood Mac wrote the 1970 hit.
   Miller spokesman Steve Forsythe said the brewer had no comment.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in
``sex, lies and videotape,'' flinches at the possibility of
becoming a superstar.
   ``I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my
family. And it would be terrible not to be able to because of
fame,'' MacDowell said in the November issue of Glamour magazine.
   MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in
``Greystoke,'' lives in a Victorian house in upstate New York with
her husband, model Paul Qualley, son Justin, 4, and daughter
Rainey, 18 months.
   She said if she weren't an acress she would be ``a mother and a
gardener.''
   ``I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to
broccoli, to corn to sunflowers,'' she said.
   She has two new movies coming out soon: ``The Object of
Beauty,'' with John Malkovich and ``Green Card'' with Gerard
Depardieu.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fans snapped up tickets for Bruce
Springsteen's first formal concert in two years in just 45 minutes.
   About 4,500 tickets were sold for the Nov. 16 show, said
spokesman Brian Fenske of the 6,300-seat Shrine Auditorium. The
$100, $50 and $25 tickets went on sale Sunday.
   The remaining tickets went to the non-profit Christic Institute
and weren't for sale.
   The concert with Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne will raise
money for the institute, which is waging a lawsuit accusing the
United States of involvement in the drug trade.
   ``We are not surprised,'' said the Rev. William Davis, the
group's West Coast director. ``Bruce and the other artists are very
popular and it will give great visibility to the issues that are
involved.''
   Springsteen's last formal concert appearance was during the 1988
Amnesty International world tour.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ed Begley Jr. says he's been into recycling
since 1970 and recently refused a ride in an NBC limousine during a
promotional tour for his new TV series, ``Parenthood.''
   Instead, Begley said in the November issue of Redbook, he rode
his bike from his San Fernando Valley home to the Century City
studio.
   ``It's late. But it's not too late,'' said the former ``St.
Elsewhere'' star, who is on the boards of seven environmental
organizations and recycles everything from newspapers to metal
products.
   ``People have to realize that they can turn this around quicker
than they think. How? By exercising their voting power and their
purchasing power.''

<HEAD>Huge Cocaine Bust; About 1,900 Pounds Seized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a raid on a rural drug refuge, the
army arrested more than 100 alleged traffickers, seized about 1,900
pounds of pure cocaine, discovered huge coca fields and destroyed
laboratories, an army official said.
   The cocaine seized in Monday's operation near Colombia's
northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported
to the United States, said regional army commander Col. Carlos
Castro.
   He said troops destroyed six cocaine-processing laboratories,
arrested 103 suspected drug traffickers and found nearly 5,000
acres of coca leaf, the raw material used to make cocaine.
   Soldiers also seized 30 vehicles, all with Venezuelan license
plates, which had been used to transport drugs, Castro said. Also
confiscated were cocaine- processing chemicals and a cache of
weapons, he said.
   The bust was considered one of the year's most important. So far
in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine,
compared to 33 tons in all of 1989.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels supply most of the
cocaine consumed in the United States. The coca leaf is mostly
grown in Bolivia and Peru, then processed in Colombia.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for a long series of
terrorist attacks in which at least 550 people have died in the
past 14 months.

<HEAD>House OKs Compromise on NEA Obscenity Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House-approved, $11.9 billion appropriations
bill heads to the Senate today with a compromise plan aimed at
settling a bitter controversy over the National Endowment for the
Arts' subsidy of allegedly obscene works.
   For the second time in less than a week, the House voted Monday
to scrap strict anti-obscenity curbs on the NEA and let the courts
decide whether federally supported arts projects are obscene.
   The plan, drafted by Reps. Pat Williams, D-Mont., and E. Thomas
Coleman, R-Mo., says obscenity ``shall not be funded'' by the
endowment. It would require grant recipients to repay the
government if they are convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   A new provision in the money bill, which finances several
federal agencies and provides $180 million to the endowment, would
require NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer to eliminate his
requirement that grant winners sign a non-obscenity pledge. That
rule has been strongly criticized by the arts community and its
supporters.
   The Williams-Coleman plan would replace restrictions that
Congress slapped on the NEA a year ago at the urging of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who was angered by endowment support for an
exhibition of sexually explicit works by the late photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe.
   Helms' amendment prohibited the NEA from supporting any works
that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of
homosexual or sadomasochistic activity or sexual exploitation of
children.
   The Williams-Coleman compromise attached to the appropriations
bill was identical to a separate measure that the House approved
last Thursday when it authorized extending the NEA's statutory
authority for three years.
   Both measures were sent to the Senate, where a similar but
simpler bill favoring a judicial approach to the ``obscene art''
controversy is awaiting floor action.
   It is unusual for the entire contents of an authorization bill
to be attached to an appropriations bill and approved by the House.
But Williams said the parliamentary maneuver was necessary to
enhance the prospects for final congressional approval of the NEA
measure.
   Williams said there was ``little, if any, chance'' that the
previously approved authorization bill would survive in the waning
days of an election-year Congress that is mired in a budget crisis.
   He noted that a high-priority appropriations bill stands a much
greater chance of passage than the NEA authorization bill. ``This
will assure, I hope, that something that the House wants in this
very divisive matter reaches the president's desk and becomes
law,'' Williams said.
   The money bill containing the NEA provisions passed the House on
a 327-80 roll call vote. It includes $180 million in arts endowment
spending in the new fiscal year that began Oct. 1, a 5 percent
increase from the NEA's $171 million budget last year.
   Before the final vote, the House approved the Williams-Coleman
plan, 234-171, as a substitute for a more strongly worded proposal
by Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, and ratified the bipartisan
compromise on a 342-58 roll call.
   Regula's amendment would have forbidden the endowment to
subsidize obscene or indecent works and ordered the NEA chairman to
ensure that federally supported works ``are appropriate for a
general audience.''
   The measure contains billions more for the Interior Department,
the Forest Service, some Energy Department programs, Indian
education and health services, the Smithsonian Institution and
other federal agencies.
   The bill also includes a one-year moratorium on exploring for
oil and gas in federal waters in many areas off New England, the
East Coast, Florida, California, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
   The House also approved, 251-155, a proposal by Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., to increase grazing fees on public lands by 500 percent
over the next four years. The plan, supported by environmental
interests, was heatedly opposed by Western lawmakers.

<HEAD>U.S. Drops Demand for End to All Trade-Distorting Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration no longer is demanding
that all farm subsidies that distort world trade be eliminated by
the end of the century, but critics question whether the change
undermines an effort to boost U.S. agricultural exports.
   U.S. negotiators on Monday offered a compromise proposal aimed
at breaking a deadlock that has threatened to scuttle a four-year
effort to reform the global trading system.
   The administration said it would seek agreement from other
countries to cut farm export subsidies by 90 percent and farm
income supports by 75 percent over the next 10 years.
   Previously, the United Stateshad sought total elimination of
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by the year 2000.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter insisted that the
administration remained committed to an ultimate goal of
eliminating all such subsidies but felt the new proposal
represented a good first step and would help to end a negotiating
stalemate.
   ``Ninety percent reform is certifiably better than no reform and
if this process fails, we are going to have no reform,'' Yeutter
told reporters Monday.
   But some critics questioned whether the United States, by
signaling a willingness to bargain on the percentage of subsidy
elimination, was opening the possibility that it will have to
settle for a good deal less than even 90 percent.
   They noted that the European Community, the 12-nation trading
bloc that is fighting the hardest to retain its subsidy program, is
considering offering a negotiating position to trim farm income
supports by just 30 percent while leaving its export programs
basically untouched.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of a Senate Finance
subcommittee overseeing trade issues, said the administration's
latest offer embraced ``the dangerous concept of percentage
reductions in agricultural support'' rather than insisting on total
elimination.
   ``Since the European Community already subsidizes its
agricultural sector substantially more than does the United States,
a 75 percent reduction by both the United States and the EC would
leave European farmers with a substantial advantage,'' Baucus said.
   The fight over farm subsidies has threatened to scuttle an
ambitious four-year effort to overhaul the world trading system.
The talks, being held under the auspices of the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are due to conclude in 50 days with
a marathon bargaining session in Brussels.
   President Bush has made successful conclusion of the discussions
his top trade priority but he has threatened to walk away if the
United States does not prevail on the farm subsidy question.
   The administration believes that the trade negotiation, known as
the Uruguay Round, offers the best chance for boosting export sales
by American farmers and businesses and thus reducing annual trade
deficits that have topped $100 billion for six consecutive years.
   Agriculture is just one of 15 areas being negotiated. The U.S.
team is pushing an ambitious agenda that also calls for dismantling
barriers to trade in services, a high-growth area where American
companies are extremely competitive; and a crackdown on copyright
piracy, estimated to cost American companies $60 billion annually.
   But agriculture is seen as the key to the talks because Third
World countries have balked at agreeing to U.S. proposals on
removing barriers to trade in services and strengthening copyright
enforcement unless they win expanded markets for their farm
products.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that in addition to
the new proposal on agriculture, the administration will unveil a
proposal, probably this week, on changes needed to lift
restrictions on access to markets.

   A House subcommittee is investigating whether
the domination of cattle slaughtering by three corporations is
hurting farmers and consumers.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on information,
justice and agriculture is gathering testimony on all aspects of
the beef business from the Agriculture and Justice departments,
economists, farmers, meat industry representatives and members of
Congress.
   ``There is a huge dispute over whether the so-called `Big Three'
is a market-driven concept or whether the `Big Three' is driving
the market to its own advantage,'' said Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., the
subcommittee chairman.
   ConAgra Inc., IBP Inc. and Excel Corp., have dominated the beef
industry since the early 1980s. About 24 percent of the business
from the raising of cattle to the delivery of carcasses to butcher
shops is owned by the three companies, a subcommittee aide said.
   ``The subcommittee intends to look at the regulatory and
legislative aspects of meatpacking concentration from both an
antitrust and agricultural point of view,'' said Wise.
   He said the panel would also investigate allegations that lack
of competition in the industry is leading to lower wages and higher
injury rates for employees in the plants.

   Legislation requiring federal inspection of
seafood is expected to be debated on the floor of the House this
week.
   However, three bills, with inspection responsibilities assigned
to different agencies, have been voted out of three committees.
   The House Rules Committee was to decide today which bill would
be the main vehicle for debate. The other two were expected to be
offered as amendments. Floor action would be later in the week.
   Congress has been in general agreement that seafood inspection
must be strengthened, but House members have not been able to agree
which agency should do it. One bill would give the job to the
Agriculture Department, the second would assign it to the Food and
Drug Administration and the third would split the responsibility
between the FDA and the Commerce Department.
   Last month, the Senate unanimously approved legislation that
places inspection responsibilities with USDA.
   ``If the House of Representatives lets the enactment of a
mandatory, federal seafood inspection fail due to its own
paralysis, then the list of those real victims who have suffered
and died from eating contaminated, uninspected seafood will grow
longer,'' said Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Heath Policy.
   Haas, who has been working for years to get Congress to act on
this issue, praised the Senate bill as ``a strong bill with many
important public health protections.''
   Currently, seafood is inspected on mostly a voluntary basis.
Some states have their own programs and a limited service is
offered by the FDA.
   ``Contaminated fish poses a real health threat to consumers,''
said Haas. ``Finfish feed on bacteria-laden algae and shellfish
filter-feed water contaminated with sewage, increasing the risk of
illness to consumers.''

   Phil Sokolof, president of the National Heart
Savers Association, is pressuring the Senate through full-page
newspaper advertisements to take a floor vote on a
nutrition-labeling bill before Congress adjourns for the year.
   With adjournment, any legislation that has not been acted upon
will die.
   Sokolof, a multimillionaire businessman from Omaha, Neb., said
Monday he spent $350,000 of his own money for ads calling for
action.
   ``Americans desperately need this bill enacted into law so they
can make the informed choices necessary to lead healthier lives,''
said Sokolof's ad in The Washington Post.
   The House already approved a bill that would set specific
standards for labeling a food ``lite'' or ``low-fat.'' It also
outlines the nutritional information that must be on packaged food
with requirements on how it must be displayed.
   Sokolof also has used full-page newspaper ads to attack
practices leading to high cholesterol content in foods: use of
tropical oils by food processors and beef fat for frying by certain
chain restaurants.
   Two years ago, tropical oils, such as cocoanut and palm oil,
were used widely in processed food, but today manufacturers are
making known that their products are free of the substance.
Restaurant companies attacked by Sokolof are now advertising they
fry their potatoes in vegetable oil.
   Whether the ads will pay off this time remains to be seen. Late
Monday, it hadn't been placed on the Senate agenda.

<HEAD>Design-Your-Own-Degree School Celebrates 20th Anniversary</HEAD>

   Hampshire College, the
design-your-own-degree school founded when the Summer of Love was
still a warm memory, turns 20 this year, having survived the
greed-is-good '80s.
   Graduates and administrators of the school, which still has no
course credits, grades or tenure, say that's a testament to
Hampshire's staying power.
   ``We are certainly a long way from the '60s now,'' said
filmmaker Ken Burns, a 1975 graduate whose Civil War documentary
recently won acclaim on public television.
   When it opened, Hampshire was a bold experiment, the brainchild
of a group of educators from nearby Smith, Amherst and Mount
Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts. Its motto:
``To Know is Not Enough.''
   From its first class of 175, the school has grown to about
1,200. Tuition, meanwhile, has grown from about $4,800 in 1970 to
more than $20,000.
   ``I think Hampshire's shown an enormous amount of courage in
staying the course,'' said 1977 graduate Aaron Lansky, who credits
the adventurous spirit of Hampshire with helping inspire him to
create the National Yiddish Book Center, now the world's largest
collection of Yiddish works.
   Hampshire, which has also produced nine Oscar nominees and two
winners, has always had shock value, with its coed dormitories,
grade-less classes and the story of the graduate who wrote his
thesis on the aerodynamics of the Frisbee.
   Graduates say it wasn't all freewheeling fun.
   ``This whole thing of Frisbee U and kind of the hippie school
thing has gotten blown out of proportion,'' Burns said. ``I never
worked harder than I did at Hampshire College in all my life.''
   At Hampshire, there are just pass-fail designations on a series
of exams. Students must pass through three divisions. In Division
I, a student must demonstrate a rudimentary grasp of the concepts
of the four schools of Humanities and Arts, Social Science,
Communications and Cognitive Science and Natural Science. In
Division II, courses must be organized around a particular theme.
In Division III, a student turns in a project equivalent to a
thesis.
   Competition to get into those early classes was fierce.
   ``There was a sense that we were making history, that we had
pioneered a whole new way of approaching education that wasn't
based on processing individuals through a kind of assembly-line
method of teaching,'' said Burns, who has twice been nominated for
an Academy Award for his documentaries.
   Hampshire's slump came in the 1980s, when applications dropped
and concern grew that unqualified students were being admitted. In
response, the student body was cut from 1,200 to 900 and the school
spent some of its $10 million endowment to operate.
   Perennial problems at Hampshire are faculty overload from what
amounts to a tutorial system of education, attrition among students
unable to cope with Hampshire's unorthodox ways, and money. The
college depends on tuition and fees for much of its approximately
$25 million annual budget.
   Financial stability is one of the goals of President Gregory
Prince, who became Hampshire's fourth president in 1989.
   Recently, after a nine-day occupation of a dormitory in 1988 by
students protesting what they perceived as indiference to minority
issues, students and teachers were required to incorporate a Third
World perspective into courses.
   Administrators say they won't relinquish Hampshire's
experimental attitude.
   ``For a college like Hampshire, what an anniversary like this
helps underscore is how much time is on our side,'' Prince said.

<HEAD>Physicians Group Calls for Removal of Nukes from Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nobel-winning physicians' group is calling for the
immediate removal from the Persian Gulf region of the more than 400
nuclear warheads it estimates are aboard U.S., British, French and
Soviet warships in the area.
   The group, the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, appealed Monday toall parties in the Persian Gulf
crisis to renounce the use of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.
   ``The gulf crisis presents an unprecedented threat of
conflagration of a war with catastrophic consequences,'' said the
group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.
   The physicians released their appeal in Rome following a
three-day meeting in the northern Italian city of Prato. Among
those attending were representatives from Israel, Jordan, Egypt and
the Palestinian Red Crescent.
   The Red Crescent is the equivalent of the Red Cross in the Arab
world.
   ``Our greatest fear is that if hostilities break out, there is a
very real prospect that nuclear weapons would be utilized,'' said
William W. Monning, executive director of the group, which is based
in Cambridge, Mass.
   Monning released the details of a study predicting the
consequences of a nuclear strike on Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   Under this scenario, dropping a single one-megaton nuclear bomb
on the city would immediately kill 1 million people, or 23 percent
of the population, and seriously injure another 1.28 million.
   The blast would kill 770 of the city's 3,080 physicians and
incapacitate 920 others, leaving 1,400 doctors to care for the 1.28
million wounded, Monning said.
   The physicians presented their appeal to officials of the U.S.,
Soviet and Iraqi embassies in Rome.
   Monning said an American diplomat told the group the United
States has no intention of starting a war or using nuclear weapons,
while the Iraqi ambassador pledged his country would only use
chemical or biological weapons in case of nuclear attack.
   The group offered to send a multinational team of doctors to
Iraq, Egypt, Israel and Jordan to explain the possible effects of a
nuclear war.
   About 40 doctors or representatives of medical associations
attended the meeting, the first bringing together Israeli and Arab
doctors to discuss the Middle East crisis, Monning said.
   The Palestinian Red Crescent was represented by its president,
Fathi Arafat, brother of PLO chief Yasser Arafat. Hillel Schenker
attended on behalf of the Israeli branch of the international
physicians' group.
   No Kuwaiti delegate was able to attend. Two Iraqi doctors had
planned to take part but were denied visas by the Italian
government, Monning said.
   Iraq precipitated the gulf crisis with its Aug. 2 seizure of
Kuwait. A U.S.-led multinational force has since massed in the
Saudi Arabian desert and on ships in the region to counter Iraq.

   Florida health officials warned against
trick-or-treating after dark on Halloween after an outbreak of
encephalitis claimed its first confirmed fatality.
   St. Louis encephalitis is carried by a mosquito that feeds at
dusk.
   A 58-year-old West Melbourne woman who died Saturday was
identified on Monday as the first confirmed fatality of the
outbreak. Authorities also awaited test results on a possible
encephalitis death last month.
   Dr. Charls S. Mahan, state health officer, called on all
Florida communities Monday to hold Halloween activities in the
afternoon to reduce the risk of exposure.
   Thirty-four people in 15 counties across central and southern
Florida have contracted St. Louis encephalitis since mid-August.
Twenty-one others have shown positive results on the first of two
tests needed for confirmation.
   The state usually has one to three cases a year. The death rate
from St. Louis encephalitis typically is 7 percent.
   Eight people died in 1977 during the last Florida outbreak.
   Symptoms of the brain inflammation include headaches, a stiff
neck, irritability, extreme sleepiness, tremors, seizures and coma.
   On Monday, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
said Florida's first confirmed fatality was Alvena Patton, who had
been in a coma since Aug. 21.
   ``The county needs to get serious about this virus,'' said her
husband, Harry Patton. ``They need to get spray trucks out and try
to stop this thing. I know it costs a lot of money, but people's
lives are at stake.''
   Mahan said that although mosquito eradication efforts have been
increased, recent rains could prolong the mosquito population until
drier and colder weather.

   Federal agents raided two ranches in northern
Mexico, seizing a record 5.9 tons of cocaine along with three small
jet planes from Colombia and five trucks, the government said
Monday.
   Sunday's seizure in Chihuahua state was the biggest ever made in
Mexico, the Attorney General's office said in a news release. No
arrests were reported.
   Minutes after five jet planes from Colombia had landed, about 60
members of the Federal Judicial Police raided a clandestine
airfield in a ranch near Ciudad Jimenez, the government said.
   Two of the planes managed to take off, and a third crashed as it
attempted to get airborne, but the pilot and several ground crewmen
fled in pickup trucks after exchanging gunfire with police, the
news release said.
   About two tons of cocaine, packed in bags, were seized there
along with the vehicles, including a tank-truck loaded with jet
fuel, it said.
   Several hours later, the agents acted on a tip and raided a
second ranch nearby, seizing another 3.9 tons of cocaine apparently
belonging to the same gang of drug smugglers, the release said.

   Easterners afraid to come to California
because of earthquakes should consider the risks at home.
   New York, Boston and other Eastern cities are gambling with
catastrophes far worse than last year's San Francisco-area
earthquake if they don't prepare better for a major quake expected
within 30 years, an expert said Monday.
   The prediction from Ian Buckle, deputy director of the National
Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, shook up a national
quake conference two days before the anniversary of the Oct. 17,
1989, quake here.
   ``The earthquake in the Bay area last year is the writing on the
wall for the East,'' he told more than 300 scientists, government
officials and engineers. ``This is a race against time, and the
odds of winning do not look favorable.''
   Seismologists at the U.S. Geological Survey estimate there is a
64 percent probability of a quake measuring 6.0 on the Richter
scale occurring somewhere in the East within the next 30 years.
   If that happens, hundreds of thousands of apartment buildings
are in danger of collapsing, along with some bridges, roads and
railroad passes, Buckle said. The result would be a huge number of
deaths and injuries and tens of billions of dollars in damage, he
said.
   New York City, hit hard by a quake in 1884, could get some of
the worst damage because of its poor soil in Brooklyn and Queens,
its dense population and thousands of older buildings of
unreinforced masonry.
   If the 1884 quake - estimated at 5.9 on the Richter scale, much
less severe than the 7.1 quake a year ago in the Bay area - were to
occur again in New York it would cause $11 billion to $26 billion
in damage, Buckle said a study has shown. Damage in the better
prepared Bay area was estimated at $6 billion.
   ``And this is not thinking of fires because of broken water
mains and the inability to control fires,'' said Buckle, a
professor of civil engineering at the State University of New York
in Buffalo.
   Skyscrapers, built to withstand wind shear, and long suspension
bridges are less vulnerable, he said.
   Medium-height masonry buildings are common all along the
Atlantic Seaboard, where moderate and strong quakes have been
recorded over the past 200 years. Charleston was struck by a quake
estimated at 7.5 magnitude in the 1800s and Boston had an estimated
7.0 in the 1700s.
   Buckle said that because of a growing awareness of the
earthquake hazard in the East, some progress has been made.
   Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York City and
Memphis, Tenn., have adopted or are close to adopting seismic
provisions in their building codes. But he said that would affect
only new structures.
   ``The retrofit of critical existing structures and lifelines
must be undertaken without delay,'' he said.
   In addition, he said, ``The drop-and-cover rules that California
schoolchildren are taught should be taught to schoolchildren in New
York and along the Atlantic Seaboard.''

   To those Americans who shrugged at the news
that Mikhail Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize, some experts on
U.S.-Soviet relations say: exactly right. That makes the point.
   ``We always said that they started the Cold War and it was up to
them to end it,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, director of East-West
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ``Now they've ended
it. The Nobel prize simply recognizes that fact.''
   Forty or 20 or 10 years ago, there'd be an uproar in America if
the leader of the Soviet state had been singled out for the prize
and the title of peacemaker.
   ``It would have been a slap at the United States and would have
discredited the Nobel Peace Prize'' for a Soviet leader to have won
it then, Mandelbaum said.
   But the revolution that Gorbachev made - the event that brought
him the prize - made communism no longer much relevant in world
affairs and the Cold War no longer a reality shaping every aspect
of American life.
   ``I can't imagine anybody in this country would take it as a
slap in the face today,'' said John Gaddis, a diplomatic historian
at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, of Gorbachev's singular honor.
   ``The things that were done in the Soviet Union last year were
things only a Soviet leader could do, but they were things that
we've been asking Soviet leaders to do since the beginning of the
Cold War. So we can only applaud.''
   For Gregory Treverton, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations and a former member of the staff of the National Security
Council, the award raised questions about how long the honoree will
be in office. Treverton said Gorbachev, like so many
revolutionaries, may be consumed by the flames he lit.
   ``It's hard to believe that he will be around for too many more
acts in the Soviet drama,'' said Treverton, alluding to the
economic and nationalistic unrest in the Soviet empire. ``He's
likely to go down as a man who set forces in motion and then was
overwhelmed by them.''
   Diplomat Winston Lord, who spent nearly three decades observing
communist affairs at the State Department, Pentagon and White House
and as Ronald Reagan's ambassador to China, said Gorbachev's honor
reflects well on America, too.
   Without taking away credit from the Soviet leader, he said, it
should be recognized that this country had a hand in persuading him
to ring down the Iron Curtain and to curtail Stalinist repression
and Marxist dogma at home.
   ``One can debate to what extent his own domestic problems plus
Western firmness induced him to make the moves on the world scene
that he's making,'' said Lord, ``but the fact is objectively he has
helped make the world less tense. I believe the United States,
including Presidents Reagan and Bush, deserves credit for these
developments as well.''
   If Americans shrugged at the news, Soviet citizens probably did
too, said Lord. ``For many, Gorbachev is irrelevant'' and so are
his foreign achievements at a time when Russians are short of bread
and see their economic system is a state of disarray.
   ``The Soviets are preoccupied with their own problems,'' he
said.
   A cautionary note was sounded by Helmut Sonnenfeld, a former
associate of Henry Kissinger in the Nixon administration. Events
will yet determine whether Gorbachev was a man who brought peace to
his country, he said.
   ``It is a question of whether the Soviet Union dissolves in
chaos or whether things improve,'' he said. ``Gorbachev's own role
may be diluted if it turns out the people of the Soviet Union start
fighting each other and, God forbid, nuclear weapons get set off.''
   In the meantime, Sonnenfeld said, the world, in celebrating
Gorbachev's prize, should not forget what 45 years of Cold War
meant.
   ``A lot of people were treated miserably, a lot died, and we
spent a huge amount of treasure and got involved in huge and costly
wars,'' he said. ``That doesn't get swept under the rug.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Issues New Proposal on Corporate Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fines for corporate crimes should be based on
the seriousness of the offense, rather than the amount of
ill-gotten gain or the financial loss to victims, the Justice
Department says.
   ``The system we are advocating will result in stiff corporate
sanctions,'' said Paul L. Maloney, a deputy assistant attorney
general who briefed reporters Monday.
   The department's position was contained in a letter to the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, which is considering various ways to punish
businesses convicted of crimes.
   The Sentencing Commission was set up in 1984 when Congress
passed legislation aimed at ending disparity in sentences given to
criminal defendants.
   The commission has set guidelines for individual defendants that
are based on the severity of the offense and any aggravating or
mitigating factors, such as a person's criminal history or
acceptance of responsibility.
   The Justice Department shied away from its earlier proposal, in
which companies involved in a massive fraud could be fined twice
their gain or twice the loss to victims.
   ``We no longer believe that this alternative maximum fine is
appropriate since it is inconsistent with the approach of basing
the fine on the seriousness of the offense,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in a letter to the commission.
   The department rescinded its earlier position on corporate
sentences after receiving an inquiry from the White House, which
had been lobbied heavily by business groups concerned about heavy
fines.
   At the time, the attorney general said the views had been
submitted without his knowledge or permission by then-Deputy
Attorney General Donald B. Ayer. The dispute with Ayer was one of
several that contributed to his resignation last spring.
   After a lengthy review, the department reiterated its support
Monday for basing fines on the severity of a crime.
   Such factors as the knowledge or participation of top management
in a criminal scheme, the involvement of bribery, or a history of
corporate misbehavior would determine the crime's severity and
therefore the fine.
   Companies that promptly report wrongdoing of employees and
cooperate with government prosecutions would receive lower fines.
   Corporate lawyer Victoria Toensing, who had argued against the
earlier proposals, called the department's proposal ``a sensible
approach.''
   Calculating fines according to mitigating and aggravating
factors would help distinguish between responsible companies whose
employees go astray and firms whose executives don't care about
observing the law, said Toensing, a former senior Justice
Department official.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Mark Hatfield has been a force in Oregon
politics for four decades, but the Republican now finds himself in
a tough re-election fight after watching his comfortable lead
plummet.
   Pouring on the pressure is businessman Harry Lonsdale, a staunch
environmentalist waging a television ad campaign that portrays
Hatfield as beholden to special interests.
   Hatfield is out of touch with Oregonians on timber and abortion
issues, says Lonsdale.
   Lonsdale also has raised questions abou  possible conflicts of
interest by the senator's longtime chief of staff, Gerry Frank.
   The 67-year-old Hatfield, who is seeking a fifth term, wouldn't
mention Lonsdale by name in the early going. Now he is fighting
back with a vengeance.
   ``When people begin to attack your family and your friends, it
demonstrates to me that they have no issues, no program and no
vision,'' says Hatfield. ``It is negative campaigning at its
foulest.''
   Lonsdale says Hatfield is the negative campaigner.
   ``The guy paints himself as Mr. Clean, but, by God, he's just
one more Washington insider,'' Lonsdale says. He calls the senator
``the imperial Mark Hatfield'' for refusing to debate.
   Hatfield says debates are political theatrics. He keeps in touch
with voters by traveling extensively around the state, he says.
   ``Oregonians deserve a debate. We pay his salary,'' complains
Lonsdale.
   Hatfield has never lost a political race and was regarded as
invulnerable when the campaign began.
   The alarms went off when a poll late last month showed
Hatfield's lead had fallen sharply. He led by six points in a
survey carrying a margin of error of four percentage points.
   That was a surge of 16 points for Lonsdale since August.
   Hatfield said the latest poll ``has done for us what we couldn't
do for ourselves. It has dispelled over confidence among our
supporters.''
   Hatfield's acceptance of campaign contributions from political
action committees shows he's beholden to the rich and powerful,
says Lonsdale, who plans to spend as much as $600,000 of his own
money on the race.
   But Hatfield contends Lonsdale is being hypocritical about the
campaign finance issue. As a wealthy businessman, Lonsdale can
afford to make pious statements about not accepting special
interest contributions, says the senator.
   Lonsdale, 58, runs a high-tech company employing about 80
people.
   ``He said very clearly that anybody who takes PAC money is on
the take,'' Hatfield said. ``He's saying that rich people are the
only ones who can be impartial. I think it's a phony accusation.''
   The two also have clashed over timber supply issues.
   Hatfield said Lonsdale wants to prohibit all logging in old
growth forests. ``He is supporting the basic concept of creating
ghost towns in this state because he's going to lock up timber
supply,'' Hatfield said. Lonsdale says Hatfield is siding with
timber interests in opposing a ban on log exports from private
lands.
   ``It's estimated that if we keep all the logs here, they'll
provide 20,000 jobs in Oregon,'' Lonsdale said.
   Lonsdale also has hit Hatfield on the abortion issue, saying
that Hatfield's opposition to abortion puts him at odds with
largely pro-choice Oregonians. Hatfield said he is philosophically
opposed to abortion and supports contraception and sex education
programs to cut down on unwanted pregnancies.
   Lonsdale's questions about Frank center on the Hatfield aide's
past position as a member of a savings and loan that later failed
and on trips that he took at government expense.

<HEAD>House Clean Air Negotiators Agree to Give Steel Industry a Break</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Talks scheduled to resume behind closed doors; lead prospects

   House and Senate negotiators are edging closer
to an agreement to control toxic industrial pollution, one of the
last hurdles to enactment of a clean air bill.
   A House proposal on air toxics was presented to the Senate late
Monday after House members decided to give the steel industry more
time to comply with the pollution controls.
   The House negotiating team had been divided on whether to accept
the Senate proposal to give steel companies an additional 20 years
- to the year 2020 - to fully comply with the measure.
   The House negotiators agreed Monday to a provision similar to
the Senate plan. Congressional sources said the House and Senate
were largely in agreement over the broad outline of the toxic
section of the bill.
   The section on toxics, which requires industry to cut these
emissions by more than 90 percent over the next 10 years, and
another section on acid rain are the two major remaining issues.
House-Senate conferees have been trying to craft a clean air bill
since mid-July.
   The acid rain provisions would require electric utilities to cut
annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons.
   Much of the debate over acid rain is expected to concern the
division of pollution credits among utilities in various parts of
the country.
   Midwest lawmakers also are pushing for a change in the base
figures for calculating how much sulfur dioxide will have to be
cut. They contend the current base figures will require emissions
to be cut by substantially more than 10 million tons.
   The steel industry has argued that the proposed pollution
control requirements will force the nation's coke ovens to shut
down.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, who fought for special treatment for
the steel industry, said the industry would be faced with ``very,
tough standards.''
   Environmentalists have acknowledged that coke ovens will need
more time to comply with the toxic emissions requirements, but
opposed giving the steel industry special treatment beyond 2010.
   The conferees earlier reached agreement on urban smog controls,
including pollution controls for industrial plants and automobiles
as well as requiring the sale of cleaner-burning fuels in cities
with the worst smog.
   Agreement also was reached to phase out chemicals that harm the
atmospheric ozone layer and on timetables for cities to reach
federal air quality requirements.

<HEAD>Republican Lawyer Files Cuomo Voting Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican lawyer is asking the state
Board of Elections to investigate whether Gov. Mario Cuomo is
illegally claiming New York City as his voting residence when he
lives in Albany.
   The elections board was also asked Monday to probe whether Cuomo
illegally voted by absentee ballot during the Sept. 11 Democratic
primary when he was actually in New York City.
   Election law says absentee ballots can only be used when a
person knows he's going to be out of the city on Election Day, says
Thomas Spargo, who filed the complaint. In fact, he said, Cuomo was
in New York City on the day of the primary.
   The complaint is an example of the ``hyper-technical silliness''
that Cuomo is trying to change by simplifying state election law,
said Gary Fryer, Cuomo's press secretary.
   If Cuomo were convicted of intentional voting fraud, he could
face one to four years in jail and up to $5,000 in fines, said
David Flanagan, Board of Elections spokesman.

   While House members are trying to reduce the
nation's massive deficit, they're also voting to authorize new
spending for projects that are too politically appealing to resist.
   For instance, 15 bills approved by the chamber Monday would cost
taxpayers about $3 billion over a number of years if the money is
actually spent. But the appropriations are not guaranteed.
   All the bills were approved by voice vote. They included
measures to help veterans, strengthen financial management in the
federal government, protect the environment in Antarctica, create a
new federal agency and help the disabled.
   The most expensive was the $2.6 billion Veterans' Compensation
Amendments bill, which would provide a 4.5 percent cost-of-living
increase for those with service-connected disabilities.
   The measure also would provide permanent disability benefits for
Vietnam veterans who suffer health problems that resulted from
exposure to Agent Orange, the herbicide used as a jungle defoliant.
   Another bill is designed to revise financial management systems
in federal agencies and establish a U.S. chief financial officer.
But in this case, you have to spend money to save money. Additional
audits under the bill would cost $10 million a year. The potential
savings have not been estimated.
   The House authorized $3 million for measures that would protect
the environment in Antarctica.
   A $4 million authorization would give taxpayers a new
International Cultural and Trade Center to create opportunities for
U.S. trade, commerce, communications and cultural exchanges with
other nations. It would be housed with other agencies in a new
building at the Federal Triangle in Washington.
   Another $251 million would be authorized in new programs for
education and training for the disabled.

   U.S. negotiators are cautiously encouraged by
Japan's progress in implementing an unusual agreement to attack the
underlying causes of the huge trade imbalance between the two
nations.
   The two countries began a two-day negotiating session on Monday
aimed at reviewing the efforts made to put the agreement, known as
the Structural Impediments Initiative, into effect.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara termed Monday's
talks constructive and useful in exploring concerns of both nations
in making sure the June agreement is implemented.
   ``You have to have these occasions so that one side can sense
where the other side has its priorities,'' Dallara said in a
telephone interview.
   The U.S. side said it raised questions in particular about
Japanese spending proposals on public works projects, efforts to
stiffen enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and plans to conduct
pricing surveys aimed at determining how much Japanese consumers
are being harmed by government policies that protect home
industries.
   The talks, being held in Boston, were scheduled to conclude
today.
   For their part, Japanese negotiators focused on the current
gridlock over reducing the U.S. budget deficit, which Tokyo has
targeted as a chief culprit in this country's poor trade
performance.
   Many economists believe that government borrowing to finance the
deficit drives up U.S. interest rates and thus makes it more
expensive for American companies to raise the capital they need to
modernize and become more competitive.
   A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Japanese expressed concern about the failure so
far of U.S. policy makers to reach agreement on a deficit-reduction
plan. However, the official said, they were encouraged by the
apparent willingness of the administration and Congress to consider
raising taxes to close the gap.
   The official said U.S. negotiators were pleased to see initial
steps by the Japanese to open up business opportunities for
American and other foreign firms. But they believed much more
progress needed to be made, particularly in eliminating the
practice of keiretsu, the interlocking arrangements between
Japanese companies that keep foreign firms out of the marketplace.
   This week's talks were to be followed by another session in
early 1991 leading up to an interim status report expected in April
or May.
   The administration is counting on the structural-impediments
agreement to significantly reduce the trade deficit with Japan,
which last year totaled $49 billion.
   Critics in Congress, however, question how long it will take to
show results.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said Monday that the Japanese have
failed to live up to many past market-opening agreements. ``It is
critical in this first round of talks to review (the initiative)
that our negotiators emphasize that the United States expects Japan
to fully implement all commitments made,'' he said.
   Baucus, who chairs a Senate trade subcommittee, said that where
compliance was lacking, the administration must be prepared to use
sections of U.S. law that permit economic retaliation if barriers
are erected to prevent sales of American products.
   Among the commitments made by Japan in June were to increase
public works spending, reduce the time it takes to issue patents
and begin vigorous criminal enforcement against bid-rigging,
price-fixing and other anti-competitive business practices.
   While past negotiations with the Japanese have sought access for
specific American industries, the new talks sought to address
fundamental problems in the American and Japanese economies that
have contributed to the trade imbalance.

<TEXT>
   A governmental insider for more than 20
years, President Bush comes across as an anti-Washington outsider
as he campaigns for Republican candidates.
   At stops in Texas and Nebraska on Monday, Congress was the
villain along with that ``inside-the-Washington, D.C., beltway
jargon.''
   More of the same was certain to follow today as Bush campaigns
in Iowa, Illinois and Michigan.
   Iowa voters were not kind to Bush in 1988. They gave him an
embarrassing third-place finish in the GOP presidential caucuses
and then backed Democrat Michael Dukakis for president.
   Not one to accept rejection easily, Bush is asking Iowans to
back his choices this November - Republican Gov. Terry Branstad and
Rep. Tom Tauke, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
   In the latest Iowa poll published Sunday in the Des Moines
Register, Branstad was leading his Democratic opponent, Don
Avenson, by 19 percentage points.
   But the same survey said Harkin was 14 points ahead of Tauke.
   In Illinois, Bush hopes to give a critical boost to Jim Edgar,
the GOP candidate for governor, who is in a close race with
Democrat Neil Hartigan. Gov. James Thompson, a Republican, is not
seeking re-election.
   But as in Iowa, the GOP prospects for upsetting an incumbent
Democratic senator were not bright.
   Polls show GOP challenger Lynn Martin trailing well behind Sen.
Paul Simon.
   Bush's last stop for the day was Michigan, where neither
gubernatorial candidate John Engler or GOP Sen. challenger Bill
Schuette were given more than long-shot chances of upsetting
Democratic incumbents.
   It was hard to tell from his stump rhetoric that Bush has spent
most of his adult life in such Washington insider jobs as
Republican Party chairman, CIA director, U.N. ambassador and vice
president.
   ``Oh, how nice it is to be out where the real people are,
outside of Washington, D.C.,'' the president told a Republican
audience in Omaha, where he raised $250,000 for Gov. Kay Orr.
   The GOP governor, who alienated many voters when she pushed for
a tax increase after a no-new-taxes campaign, is trailing her
Democratic opponent by eight percentage points in the most recent
poll.
   ``What the states need is not more programs mandated from
Washington, D.C., said the president.
   ``Texas and Texans have the solutions,'' he said in Dallas.
``Give Nebraskans a chance to solve the problems,'' he said in
Omaha.
   ``I honestly believe,'' said the president, ``if we had had more
Republicans in control of Capitol Hill over the last couple of
decades, this budget mess that we're in right now would never have
happened.''
   That partisan sentiment ignored the fact that budget deficits
soared while there was a Republican president - Ronald Reagan -
working with a Republican-controlled Senate.
   As for the current budget crisis, the president laid the blame
on the Democrats in control of Congress, even though much of the
opposition to the bipartisan agreement rejected two weeks ago came
from his on party.
   But that is the way of campaign rhetoric and for all his jibes
at the Democrats in Congress, Bush stopped far short of the attack
rhetoric used by Ally Milder, the GOP candidate challenging
Democratic Rep. Peter Hoagland in Nebraska.
   Milder described Congress as ``full of rats, gnawing at the ship
of state.''
   ``Throw the rats overboard,'' she urged the partisan audience.

   Fewer than one in five people in the United
States believe things in the country are ``generally going in the
right direction,'' according to a new poll.
   That response reported Monday was the lowest since The
Washington Post-ABC News poll began asking the question in 1982.
Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they believed ``things
have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong track.''
   Most people still approve of the way President Bush is handling
his job - 56 percent. But only a week before, 65 percent approved,
In early September, three-quarters of respondents approved.
   Similarly, the proportion approving the way Bush is dealing with
the economy fell from 53 percent in September to 38 percent during
the survey taken Wednesday through Sunday.
   Bush still got high ratings for his handling of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait - 64 percent - but it was down from 78 percent
in September.
   Respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of
the way the president, Democrats in Congress and Republicans in
Congress were handling the deficit. Nobody won high marks.
   Compared with the previous week, the president's ``approve''
response fell to 33 percent from 38 percent, the Democrats' fell to
30 percent from 32 percent, within the likely margin of error, and
the Republicans' fell to 23 percent from 33 percent.
   The poll interviewed 1,006 people selected at random. In such a
poll, the likely margin of error is 3 percentage points either way.

   However, Dugan, a 32-year veteran and former fighter pilot,
maintains his rank as four-star general until President Bush
formally nominates him for retirement and the Senate acts on the
nomination. Purka said Bush had not yet made the nomination.
   If the Senate does not act within 90 days of the date of Dugan's
dismissal as chief of staff, his rank would slip to major general,
Purka said. Major general is two notches below general.

   A drug company is recalling three lots of a
bronchodialator drug product that may have been packaged in
mislabeled cartons.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Monday the product is
Metaproterenol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, USP 5 percent. Some
bottles of the product may have been packaged in an outer folding
carton labeled Carbinoxamine Compound Drops, which is used to treat
cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergy or
colds in children.
   The FDA advised parents who have been prescribed Carbinoxamine
Compound Drops that the correct medication is purple in color with
a grape flavor and grape odor. It uses a dropper with four distinct
graduation lines between \ and 1 milliliter.
   The inhalation solution is pale yellow and its dropper shows
measuring lines at 0.2 milliliter and 0.3 milliliter.
   If used as pediatric drops in infants, the inhalation solution
could cause nervousness, excessively rapid heartbeat, tremor and
nausea. It also could cause hypertension, palpitation, vomiting and
bad taste.
   Both products are made by Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Morton
Grove, Ill, which issued the recalled in cooperation with the FDA.
   The FDA also recommended that pharmacists review their records
since February and notify any patient who had been given either of
the products so they could examine the medications and their
labels.
   The recalled lots of Metaproterenol Sulfate Inhalation Solution,
USP 5 percent, are numbers 18222K, 18421H and 18421C. Packages of
Carbinoxamine Compound Drops with the same lot numbers also are
being recalled.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill to Hire Watchdog Official</HEAD>

   Legislation that would establish a chief
financial officer to target wasteful spending in the bureaucracy
has cleared the House over the Bush administration's opposition.
   The House passed the bill on a voice vote Monday. It now goes to
the Senate, where similar legislation is pending.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the bill's sponsor, said scandals in
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and elsewhere in
government could be traced to ``the deplorable state of the
government's own management infrastructure - particularly our
financial management systems.''
   ``It is almost inconceivable that an organization which controls
almost one-fourth of the country's gross national product has
incompatible and outmoded financial management systems,'' Conyers
said.
   The bill would create a ``centralized and professional
leadership structure'' at the Office of Management and Budget, he
said.
   The Bush administration opposes the bill, the OMB said in a
statement. While supporting efforts to improve government
management, the bill would create confusion and blur the lines
between the executive and legislative branches, it said.
   The administration favors establishing a deputy director for
management and a government-wide controller in OMB, as well as
chief financial officer positions in each department, the statement
said.

<TEXT>
   An ambitious plan to build a glittering new
airport in Britain's last great colony has turned into a battle
between Beijing and London for political influence and billions of
dollars.
   The airport was supposed to be a parting gift.
   Now there are widespread worries that it won't open by the
target date of 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule.
   Some fear it will never be built at all.
   The airport's expense - $16 billion by conservative estimates -
has prompted charges that it will be a cash cow for British
companies.
   ``It's Britain's last great present to itself,'' says Gordon Wu,
a leading Hong Kong businessman with close links to China. ``It's
their license to print money.''
   These allegations provoke countercharges that China will not
back the project unless it gets a substantial slice of the pie.
   The controversy highlights fears that the colonial government is
a lame duck, that China already calls the shots in the territory.
   The first works contract for the airport, a $26 million deal for
dredging, went to a Chinese-owned firm.
   ``Beijing's main reason for allowing Hong Kong to exist is so
the goose can lay golden eggs,'' said an American executive
involved in the project. ``The airport project is definitely a
golden egg.''
   The latest chapter in the imbroglio concerns funding for a main
item in the project, a 4,719-foot suspension bridge that would be
the second-longest in the world and connect the airport to Kowloon
peninsula, the side of Hong Kong located on the Chinese mainland.
   On Friday, Chinese officials lashed out at Hong Kong's decision
to fund the bridge from government coffers. The move added further
weight to Chinese fears that London is treating the project as its
last Asian pork barrel.
   Ji Pengfei, the most senior Chinese official in charge of Hong
Kong affairs, called the move ``unilateral and inappropriate'' and
warned the Hong Kong government not to try any more ``tricks.''
   Hong Kong authorities defended the bridge and criticized one
pro-Beijing awyer in the territory for making a ``political
speech'' against the airport.
   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, announced the airport
plan last October, saying it demonstrated Britain's commitment to
Hong Kong's future.
   The announcement came as the government tried to restore
confidence in this territory of 5.7 million people severely shaken
by China's bloody crackdown on a pro-democracy movement in June
1989. Many people in the colony do not believe China's promise that
it will maintain Hong Kong's open economic and social system for 50
years after it resumes control.
   The airport plan, one of the biggest engineering projects of the
1990s, includes flattening two hilly islands and connecting them by
dumping 260 million cubic yards of rocks and sand into the ocean.
   The centerpiece is the new airport on Chep Lap Kok, an island
separated from downtown Hong Kong by 16 miles of open sea.
   The airport would replace the current one, Kai Tak, on the
Kowloon peninsula, famed for its wild landings. Some approaches are
so harrowing that passengers feel they're heading for an unwanted
kiss with a poster of the Marlboro man on a garage wall.
   The new airport would operate 24 hours a day and handle 80
million passengers a year, more than three times the capacity of
Kai Tak.
   When the airport was announced, Zhou Nan, China's top
representative in Hong Kong, demanded negotiations with the
colonial government.
   But after intense pressure from Beijing, the government relented
and talks began Monday in Hong Kong.
   Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a leading educator and political observer in
the colony, predicts problems like the airport project will
multiply in the next seven years.
   ``China is staking a claim to exert control over Hong Kong not
in 1997,'' he said, ``but now.''

   Residents downwind from open-air nuclear
tests of the 1950s and '60s said they felt vindicated by the
government's decision to pay up to $50,000 compensation to those
who may have gotten cancer from the radiation.
   But some remained bitter Monday after years of legal wrangling
over the issue. Others doubted whether they would actually see any
money.
   President Bush signed a bill during a campaign trip to Dallas on
Monday that provides up to $50,000 to cancer victims who were
exposed to test radiation in three Western states and up to
$100,000 to uranium miners also stricken.
   It also offers an apology to the victims. The White House said
victims do not have to establish scientifically that the fallout
caused their cancer.
   ``I'm glad they're owning up to it,'' said Rula Orton of
Parowan. ``I feel very good about that.'' Orton's 14-year-old
daughter, Peggy, died in 1960 of leukemia that her doctors believe
may have been linked to nuclear radiation.
   Elmer Pickett, whose wife died of leukemia in 1960, was still
bitter.
   ``I feel those people who were running the Atomic Energy
Commission knew very well what they were doing to us up here,'' he
said from his home in St. George.
   ``They're just as guilty of murder as those running the death
camps in Germany. There should be some punishment there.''
   The number of victims or survivors eligible for the payments was
not immediately known.
   The United States conducted more than 200 atomic tests in the
open air in the South Pacific and Nevada before they were outlawed
by the Test Ban Treaty of 1963.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who co-sponsored the bill, called
those who lived downwind from the tests ``victims of the Cold
War.''
   Elizabeth Wright of the National Association of Radiation
Survivors said Monday's action is vindication for her father,
Arthur F. Bruhn. The former president of Dixie College in St.
George died of cancer in 1963.
   ``He said, `Someday they'll know these tests are killing me,' ''
she said.
   One of those who helped lead the fight for compensation, former
Gov. Scott M. Matheson, died of cancer last week. He grew up in
Cedar City during the tests of the early 1950s. His son, Scott,
said his father found it an ``interesting wrinkle'' that he too was
diagnosed with a disease linked to the tests.
   The downwinders won a federal lawsuit against the government for
compensation in 1982, but it was overturned on appeal.
   The bill signed by Bush on Monday provides compensation for
people who developed cancer in certain time periods and:
   -Spent one or two years, depending on their type of cancer, in
downwind areas of Nevada, Arizona or Utah between 1951 and 1958, or
were present in June or July of 1962.
   -Or mined uranium in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming or
Utah from 1947 to 1971.
   The bill authorizes placing $100 million in a Radiation Exposure
Trust Fund for victims. Future legislation is needed to actually
allocate the money.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, another of the bill's sponsors, said
some payments could be made before the end of the year.
   Steve P. Foster, a uranium miner from Grand Junction, Colo., who
lost part of his right lung to cancer, was skeptical. ``I suspect
from my past association with the government, I don't think we will
ever get anything out of it,'' he said.

<HEAD>The King of Tonga Has a Deal for Washington State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The king of Tonga, a banana-exporting
South Pacific island nation with 443 cars, wants all the tires
Washington state can spare.
   Not to put them on cars, but to burn them.
   King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV sees mounds of rubber as the answer to
his kingdom's quest for energy independence and is pounding on the
governor's door to cut a deal.
   Washington state has an estimated 30 million old tires, which
pose a major fire and environmental hazard that grows by 4 million
to 5 million tires a year, officials say. But so far, the state has
been cool to the king's idea.
   The king wants the state to spend $25.5 million up front to
gather, chip and ship the 30 million tires to his kingdom, a group
of islands about 3,000 miles southwest of Honolulu. He also wants a
guaranteed supply of old tires.
   By taking the tires off the state's hands, the deal would ``lay
a sound base for future trade and commercial development projects''
with Tonga, the king told Gov. Booth Gardner in a recent letter.
   The king requested a meeting with the governor by month's end,
but a Gardner spokesman said Monday he was too busy to meet anytime
soon.
   ``Besides, we want to be sure and be fair,'' said Dan Youmans.
``We are expecting other proposals by February on handling waste
tires. It wouldn't look right to meet with just the king.''
   The king's proposal and a similar request from the South Pacific
island of Yap are drawing opposition from environmentalists, who
contend Washington's waste problem should not be exported to the
Third World.
   But Dale Clark, the state's tire recycling coordinator at the
Department of Ecology, considers the proposal worth investigation.
He said the king has given assurances the tires would be burned
only if the best pollution control technology were employed. Such
technology is in use at a tire burning plant near Modesto, Calif.,
Clark said.
   Tonga lives on tourism and banana exports. As of 1983, the
kingdom of 108,000 people had 443 cars.
   ``Based on our plan to provide for future energy requirements as
well as the present needs of Tonga, we would need a guaranteed
supply'' of tires, the king wrote.
   In 1989, Washington began collecting a $1 tax on every new tire
for studies on tire disposal. The fund has grown to about $2
million. But the Department of Ecology is still searching for ways
to dispose of tires in an environmentally sound manner.
   Clark said some tires are chipped and used in highway asphalt.
Others are made into truck floor mats, tugboat bumpers and other
products. But the supply still overwhelms demand, Clark said, and
they pose a serious threat if they catch fire.
   Tire fires are extremely hard to fight and can burn for weeks.
Their thick, acrid smoke can make people sick and force
evacuations.
   An arsonist was blamed for a monthlong 1984 fire that burned 5
million to 7 million tires in Everett. Firefighters tried to douse
the flames with water but the Environmental Protection Agency made
them stop, saying the runoff was polluting a river nearby.
   ``Burning tires is an environmentally disastrous idea,'' said
Joe Thornton, a toxics information specialist for Greenpeace
International in Chicago.
   ``Tires are a complex stew of heavy metals, chlorine and
hydrocarbons. The heavy metals, arsenic, lead, mercury, come out of
the stack or wind up in the ash, which becomes another disposal
problem.''
   When burned, toxic compounds such as cancer-causing dioxin and
PCBs are produced, Thornton said.
   ``As has been amply demonstrated in this country, the best
technology is not good enough. Better equipment will not make the
pollution problem go away,'' he said.
   ``Let me ask you a simple question,'' said Ann Leonard, a
spokeswoman for Greenpeace's International Waste Trade Project in
Washington, D.C.
   ``If it's environmentally safe to burn waste tires for energy,
why aren't you doing it in Washington? I'll tell you why. Because
it isn't safe and people in your state wouldn't stand for it.''

<TEXT>
   The third game of the world chess championship
between champion Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov was suspended
until tonight with neither man showing a clear advantage.
   Play was halted just after 10:30 p.m. Monday when Kasparov wrote
down his 41st move and sealed it in an envelope. The game was to
resume at 5:30 p.m. with the match arbiter opening the envelope.
   ``The adjourned position is a complete mess,'' said one
spectator, Joel Benjamin, a grandmaster from New York City.
``Nobody knows what's happening.''
   In the adjourned position, Karpov, playing the white pieces, has
a king, rook, bishop, knight and four pawns. Kasparov has a king,
two bishops, a knight and five pawns.
   ``There are chances for both sides and I predict a draw,'' said
grandmaster Dmitri Gurevich of Chicago.
   Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess,
leads 1{ points to { point in the 24-game match against Karpov, 39,
the world champion he unseated in 1985.
   The arch-rivals have played more than 120 games. Most of them,
like Game 1 of this match, were draws. Kasparov, who has a bold,
attacking style, won Game 2. Karpov is known for a more methodical,
defense-minded style.

   You might call them postcards
from the ledge.
   Artist Nick Agid carves messages into slabs of stone and mails
them to politicians, celebrities, world leaders, authors and fellow
artisans.
   Using material left over from his sculpture work, Agid has
lovingly etched more than 600 mineral missives out of onyx, marble
and granite.
   ``It started out being a whim and it became a serious art
project,'' he says.
   He spends about an hour chiseling a message into each polished
stone, always including a request for a reply.
   The cost of mailing the four- to five-pound cards is heavy - up
to $10 a throw, and much more for international celebrities. But
Agid doesn't mind.
   ``The responses were so humorous, it became kind of addicting to
check the mail and see who wrote me back,'' he said. ``I got a
letter from the pope and Ted Kennedy on the same day.''
   Many who have gotten the rock cards - including President Bush,
Elizabeth Taylor, director Mel Brooks, author Ray Bradbury and
actor Vincent Price - have responded.
   Price sent his response on the inner sole of a shoe, writing,
``Upon my sole, I've never had such a heavy fan letter. Are you
sure you have all your marbles?''
   From others - Iraq's Saddam Hussein, for instance - there has
been stony silence.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Los Angeles, known for his opposition
to the National Endowment for the Arts, cast stones at Agid's
artistic endeavor.
   ``The only true value something like your brick has is that
which people will voluntarily pay for it,'' he said. ``That's why
so many no-talent artists end up seeking grants from the NEA.''
   San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse took the Postal
Service to task for the way it handled his five-pound slab of onyx.
   ``I still have the rock,'' he wrote in his column. ``It arrived
in a plastic envelope and says `Damaged in Shipment.'
   ``Only the post office could damage a rock.''
   Relations between Agid and the Postal Service are indeed a bit
rocky. Postal workers tend to balk when he shows up with as many as
40 stone slabs to mail.
   ``We were never mad at him,'' said Betty Baker, a clerk at the
Torrance Post Office. ``It's just we avoid him. It takes so much
time to mail his rocks. It gets our counters real dirty.''
   At one point, the Postal Service threatened to stop accepting
Agid's mailings. Word was that one of his rocks broke a conveyor
belt.
   To smooth things over, he sent a carved card to Postmaster
General Anthony Frank, who wrote back, ``It is always a pleasure to
be contacted by one of our customers, especially one as rock-solid
as you are.''
   Not wanting his year-old project to gather moss, Agid plans to
put the responses he's gotten into a book.
   ``I have brought a few laughs into the lives of the people who
have gotten my cards,'' he said. ``After you've gotten a rock in
the mail, you never know what to expect from then on.''

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Down, Stocks Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Tuesday despite a brief morning rally, and stocks surged for
the second day.
   The dollar ended the day at 128.05 yen, down 0.10 yen from
Monday's finish. After opening at 128.08 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 127.75 and 128.35 yen. On Monday, the dollar fell
1.15 yen.
   The dollar's closing was its lowest since its 127.63-yen finish
on March 6, 1989.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 23,606.10, up 496.90 points, or 2.15 percent. An
estimated 500 million shares were traded on the market's first
section.
   On Monday, the Nikkei index gained 719.04 points.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds rose to
83.67 points from their close of 83.40 on Monday. Their yield
dipped to 7.990 percent from 8.055 percent on Monday.
   Traders said the stronger yen, stable bond prices and an
overnight rise on the New York Stock Exchange helped buoy share
prices.
   In New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
18.32 points to 2,416.34 on Monday, following a 32.92-point gain on
Friday.
   Despite some profit-taking sell pressure, the Nikkei index was
supported by arbitrage buying prompted by strong advances in
futures prices, traders said.
   Traders said caution over the rapid pace of the dollar's recent
fall slowed its decline on Tuesday.
   The brief early morning rally spurred by traders seeking to
cover short dollar positions failed to build strength because of a
lack of fundamental factors to support buying, said Yasuhisa
Morikuni of the Bank of America.
   ``The factors favoring the rise of the yen have been prevalent
recently. This trend has been prolonged and has encouraged the
buying back of the yen,'' said a Bank of Tokyo official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Traders said short-term sentiment for the dollar appeared mixed.
While many market participants forecast that the dollar would fall
over the medium term, its steep losses over the past several weeks
led some to predict a technical rally.

   News organizations appealed a decision by
a federal judge to close jury selection at the trial of one of nine
state lawmakers indicted in a vote-buying scandal.
   The move Monday by U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins tightened
the lid on coverage of the case of Rep. Luther Taylor. The judge
already had barred attorneys from discussing the case outside court
and sealed records from the media.
   Hawkins said he feared prospective jurors might not answer as
truthfully if reporters were present during questioning. He also
said open jury selection could affect cases against others charged
in the FBI sting.
   News organizations asked a federal appeals judge to stay
Hawkins' ruling, but he refused. They then filed an emergency
appeal before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va. No hearing was immediately scheduled.
   ``There has to be a balancing process so that any restriction on
our right of access is as narrow as can be and still protecting the
Sixth Amendment right'' of a fair trial, said Jay Bender, an
attorney for the South Carolina Press Association.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel took no position on the matter.
   Taylor, 40, a Democrat from Columbia, is one of nine state
lawmakers indicted in August and September on charges of taking
bribes in exchange for their support of a bill legalizing betting
on horses and greyhounds.
   Some lawmakers were videotaped taking payoffs.
   Four lawmakers have pleaded guilty to bribery. A fifth has
pleaded guilty to a drug charge that resulted from the
investigation.
   Taylor's attorney, Joel Collins, did not ask that jury selection
be closed, but had sought the sealing of court records about Taylor
and other lawmakers.
   Collins had argued further disclosures about the case would make
it impossible to find an impartial 12-member jury.
   Seven jurors had been seated by Monday night, and Bender said
pretrial publicity apparently had not had a great effect on
prospective jurors.
   Taylor, who has served in the state House since 1983, is accused
of accepting $4,300 for supporting the betting bill. If convicted,
he could get up to 120 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine.

   The Ulysses spacecraft, speeding toward
Jupiter on a roundabout mission to explore the sun's poles in
1994-95, is firing its thrusters this week to adjust its course,
NASA says.
   ``Everything is proceeding as planned. There hasn't been a
single hiccup or glitch of any kind,'' Franklin O'Donnell,
spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said after the
four-day maneuver started Monday.
   Ulysses was released from shuttle Discovery on Oct. 6 on a 1.86
billion-mile mission during which it will use the gravity of
Jupiter, the solar system's biggest planet, to sling it into orbit
over the sun's poles.
   Ulysses was 6.1 million miles from Earth on Monday, traveling
toward Jupiter at a speed of 25,370 mph relative to the Earth. It
is expected to make its closest approach to Jupiter in 1992.

   An earthquake measuring 5.5 on the
Richter scale jolted the Iranian town of Tabas and nearby areas,
Iran's official news agency reported today. There was no immediate
word on damage or casualties.
   The Geophysics Institute of Tehran University said the quake
struck late Monday about 370 miles southeast of Tehran, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said no reports of damage or
casualties had been released.
   In July, tens of thousands of people were killed in an
earthquake that devastated a large part of northwestern Iran.
   A quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, which measures
ground motion recorded on a seismograph, can cause considerable
damage.

   The USS Midway, the oldest of the
Navy's 15 aircraft carriers, is being dispatched to the Arabian Sea
in support of Operation Desert Shield, naval sources say.
   The 62,000-ton Midway, based at Yokosuka, Japan, and currently
on maneuvers with Japanese self-defense forces, will replace the
USS Independence next month, the sources said on Monday.
   The sources, who asked not to be named, said they did not know
why the World War II-vintage Midway was chosen for the deployment
ahead of one of the Navy's newer carriers.
   The ship has a limited operational capability compared to its
larger, more modern counterparts, and has been marked for
retirement for the last few years.
   In addition, the 64,000-ton ship has had problems since 1987,
when it underwent a $200 million overhaul designed chiefly to
upgrade its ability to handle the F-18 Hornet attack aircraft.
   The hull was redesigned with special ``blisters'' intended to
improve stability in rough seas. Instead, Naval officials have
said, they cause the ship to ``porpoise'' in seas running more than
five to eight feet, making flight operations more difficult in such
conditions.
   U.S. Navy spokesmen declined comment on the reported deployment
plan, citing a policy against discussing the future movements or
locations of U.S. warships.
   The Naval sources said they did not know why the Midway was
chosen over newer and larger carriers for the Desert Shield
deployment.
   The Midway, built during World War II but launched too late to
see action, has gone through several modernizations in its 45
years, to keep pace with newer flattops.
   It has been based at Yokosuka since 1973, the only U.S. carrier
based outside the United States. It has had numerous assignments to
the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, including at least one stint
during the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.
   It carries about 75 aircraft, including F-18s, AS-6 intruder and
A-7 Corsair attack bombers.
   The ship reportedly will be accompanied by its usual battle
group, including the Aegis missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the
missile cruiser USS Sterett.
   The United States has three other carriers in the region, the
Independence in the Arabian Sea, the John F. Kennedy in the Red Sea
and the Saratoga in the eastern Mediterranean.
   The 80,000-ton Independence, based at San Diego and sent to the
Arabian Sea in July, was already in the area when Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Since then, its 70-plus warplanes have flown regular patrols
over the Persian Gulf and trained for possible action against Iraq.
   The Independence made a two-day sortie into the Persian Gulf,
the first by an aircraft carrier since 1974.

<TEXT>
   ABC News says it is putting on hold its plans
for an overnight news service and considering closing several U.S.
bureaus.
   ABC News President Roone Arledge on Monday cited the expense of
covering the Persian Gulf crisis and a reduced revenue from a soft
advertising market.
   The network last month said it planned to start a 1 a.m.-to-6
a.m. weekday broadcast in January that would give affiliates live
and taped segments, domestic and international news, sports and
weather in 30-minute packages.
   Richard C. Wald, ABC News senior vice president, said the plan
``has been put off for the time being'' and he didn't know when it
might become active again.
   ABC spokeswoman Sherrie S. Rollins said no decision has been
made on bureau closings but that an announcement probably will be
made in a week or two.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A number of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets fired
from southern Lebanon exploded in northern Israel today but caused
no damage or injury, the military command said.
   Israeli forces returned fire to the source of the rockets, an
army communique added.
   Army radio said the Katyushas were apparently fired by the
fundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, from
north of the buffer zone that Israel maintains in southern Lebanon.
   Last week, a number of ground-to-ground Katyushas were fired
from Lebanon but none reached Israel.
   Israel carved out the two- to 10-mile wide buffer zone in 1985
to help protect its northern border from guerrilla raids after it
withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon after a three-year
occupation.
   The zone is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers and some 2,500
members of the South Lebanon Army, a Lebanese-militia trained and
financed by Israel.

<HEAD>South Korean Delegation Arrives in North Korea for Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highest-ranking South Korean
official ever to cross the armed border into North Korea said today
that he would propose that the rival countries officially recognize
each other.
   ``The first step toward improving bilateral relations must be,
above all else, recognizing and respecting the existence of each
other,'' said Prime Minister Kang Young-koon.
   Kang was to hold talks with his North Korean counterpart, Yon
Hyong Muk, on Wednesday in the second round of the highest-level
contacts between the rival Koreas since the division of the
peninsula in 1945.
   The two met in Seoul in September.
   News reports said the two premiers embraced ``in a bear hug'' on
meeting today in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
   ``We heartily welcome you here,'' Yon said.
   ``We felt overwhelmed by a thousand emotions,'' said Kang, who
was born in the north and fled to the south as a refugee in 1945.
   The 90-member South Korean delegation will return home on Friday
after two days of talks. Their agenda includes formal dinners and
sightseeing.
   In the South Korean capital of Seoul, meanwhile, more lawmakers
joined opposition leader Kim Dae-jung in a hunger strike to demand
democratic reforms. Kim, leader of the Party for Peace and
Democracy, was in the ninth day of his fast, and 41 lawmakers have
joined him in the past two days.
   Officials of the governing Democratic Liberal Party indicated
today they would make concessions on some opposition demands,
including moving up the date of local elections.
   Although the policy-making jobs of the prime ministers of the
north and south are limited and their roles are largely ceremonial,
the talks hold symbolic value between two nations that view each
other as enemies.
   The border between the two Koreas remains tightly sealed with
more than 1.5 million troops on either side. The nations fought a
three-year war in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never
signed.
   South Korea has recognized Communist North Korea as a separate
countary, but the north has steadfastly refused to recognize the
south, claiming that to do so would perpetuate division.
   South Korea has said hostilities will not end until both
governments officially accept the existence of the other.
   ``Differences in ideology and system between the two parts of
Korea must no longer form a barrier dividing the people,'' Kang
said at a welcoming ceremony at the government guest house, where
the delegation will stay.
   ``Just like the proverb saying that things begun are already
half done, let's make rapid progress and fulfill the desires of 70
million people,'' Kang said.
   In a separate move, the North Korean Red Cross proposed a
resumption of talks on Nov. 15 to discuss the reunion of families
separated by partition of the peninsula. The Red Cross talks were
broken off about a year ago.
   An estimated 10 million people are separated from family
members, and the issue of reconciliation is emotional for both
sides.
   Even as the two sides readied to meet, North Korean radio
broadcast a statement threatening an end to the north-south
dialogue if South Korea does not end its annual military exercises
with U.S. troops.
   A demand to halt the Team Spirit exercises was one of three made
by North Korea in the first round of talks. The north also demanded
the release of dissidents jailed for visiting North Korea and
insisted the South halt efforts to join the United Nations as a
separate nation.

   News ranging from lower oil prices to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Nobel Prize boosted stock prices in Tokyo
today, brokers said, while the dollar slipped further against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 496.90 points, or 2.15
percent, closing at 23,606.10. It had gained 3.21 percent, or
719.04 points, on Monday.
   ``An overall combination of factors contributed to the
performance of the market today,'' said Yasufumi Kawashima of Sanyo
Securities Co. He added, however, that buying was leisurely.
   News such as Gorbachev's winning the Nobel Peace Prize added to
a feeling of stability, he said.
   Brokers also mentioned stability on the New York market, lower
oil prices and foreign investors' buying of high-tech issues such
as Hitachi Ltd. and insurance shares that had been considered
under-priced.
   Large securities firms were selling aggressively to foreign
investors, whose purchases moved prices because they were buying
thinly traded issues, the brokers added.
   Reports that the long-term prime interest rate may be lowered
also encouraged buying, said Toshiyuki Higuchi of Daiwa Securities
Co.
   Trade volume on the first section was about 500 million shares,
up from 370.7 million shares Monday.
   The dollar, meanwhile, closed at 128.05 yen, down 0.10 yen from
Monday's close of 128.15 yen. After opening at 128.08 yen, it
ranged between 127.75 yen and 128.35 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 9.90 yen in the last 11 trading days.
   ``The factors favoring the rise of the yen have been prevalent
recently. This trend of the yen's stability has been prolonged and
encouraged the buying of the yen,'' said an official at the Bank of
Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But another dealer at a major bank commented, ``There is a
definite overselling of the dollar. No one thinks the dollar is
going to plunge, that the U.S. economy is going to be destroyed
overnight or that the tools they own are going to become dust
overnight.''
   He said market players seem to be turning cautious, preparing
for a possible reaction to the overselling.
   ``Everything bad there is to say about the dollar has already
been said. It can't hit a further bottom,'' he added.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds rose
to 83.78 points from their close of 83.40 on Monday. Their yield
dropped to 7.970 percent from 8.055 percent Monday.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Consul: He Unknowingly Sought Money from Drug
Trafficker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's consul, a nephew of President Violeta
Chamorro, says he unknowingly solicited money for the Contras in
the 1980s from a drug trafficker but denies he received millions of
dollars for cocaine shipments.
   Adolfo ``Popo'' Chamorro was accused during a trial in Tulsa,
Okla., earlier this year of involvement in a ``guns-for-drugs''
scheme.
   Two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity have since said
that Chamorro, along with Octaviano Cesar, brother of a top aide to
Mrs. Chamorro, are being investigated by the Customs Service and
other agencies.
   At a news conference Monday, Chamorro said he met in 1984 with
George Morales, who he thought at the time was a wealthy Miami
Cuban sympathetic to the anti-communist Nicaraguan rebels, to gain
support for the Contras.
   Chamorro said that U.S. officials authorized the contact and
that he had no knowledge or involvement in drug trafficking.
   But Chamorro, 41, abruptly ended the news conference when asked
whether U.S. authorities warned him that Morales was under
indictment on drug charges when the Contras took cash and planes
from him.
   Accusations linking Chamorro with ``guns-for-drugs'' deals are
not new. In testimony before a 1987 Senate committee, Morales said
Chamorro and Octaviano Cesar arranged a trade of guns and drugs in
Costa Rica.
   The accusations against Chamorro lay dormant until testimony by
Colombian drug pilot Fabio Ernesto Carrasco in a Tulsa drug case
seven months ago.
   Carrasco said he paid millions of dollars to Chamorro and
Octaviano Cesar to fly cocaine into Florida on planes that returned
to Central America with arms.
   Morales is serving a 16-year sentence.

<HEAD>Ten Killed In Bloody Battle At Coal Mine In Latest Factional

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Rival Zulus and Xhosas armed
with spears and knives clashed in a factional fight at a coal mine
and 10 people were hacked to death and 48 injured, police said
today.
   A police spokesman, who declined to be named, said that fighting
erupted late Monday at Hlobane Colliery near Vryheid in northern
Natal Province.
   The area has been a battleground between conservative Zulu
forces and followers of the African National Congress.
   A group of Zulus went on a rampage in the workers' quarters at
the mine, attacking rival Xhosas, the spokesman said. The two
groups fought with knives, axes and spears, he said.
   Police said they did not know what started the clash.
   The fight followed a clash in Johannesburg that left eight
people dead. The incidents marked a new outbreak of black factional
violence after several weeks of relative calm.
   More than 800 people were killed in factional fighting between
Zulus of the Inkatha movement and ANC supporters in black townships
around Johannesburg in August and September.
   Police also said Tuesday two men and one woman were killed in
separate unrest incidents in other parts of Natal during the past
24 hours. One of the men was killed when two groups armed with
spears fought at a bus station in Empangeni.
   In other developments, police in the black Kwazulu homeland said
43 people had been murdered durng the weekend. The report did not
say how many deaths were politically motivated.
   Kwazulu, a semi-autonomous black homeland, is administered by
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha movement.
   South African news reports Tuesday said the clash Monday in
Johannesburg began when a mini-bus filled with armed men attacked a
workers compound nar the Kempton Park district.
   The attackers, some of whom were wearing masks, opened fire on
sleeping workers with automatic weapons, the reports said.
   Unidentified men in mini-buses were blamed for starting much of
the bloody fighting in the Johannesburg area last month. ANC
leaders charged the attackers were linked to the security forces
and were trying to fan black violence.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government and police commanders have
denied the ANC charges.
   The government imposed curfews and introduced strict security
last month in black townships around Johannesburg hit by factional
fighting. Curfews had been lifted in some areas and security
relaxed in recent days as the fighting appeared to have ended.
   Police commanders said today that they were keeping a close
watch on the fresh outbreaks of violence and would increase
security to prevent it spreading.
   The fighting has pittted Inkatha against Xhosas and other blacks
loyal to the left-leaning ANC. The two sides oppose apartheid, but
differ over goals for a future South Africa, including economic
plans and leadership questions.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Requires Cigarette Machine Tokens; New York Considers
Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pittsburgh has acted to keep cigarettes out of youngsters' hands
by requiring the use of tokens in all cigarette vending machines,
while New York City moved toward banning the machines in almost all
public places.
   The token law was signed by Mayor Sophie Masloff on Monday. It
becomes effective Nov. 7.
   In New York, the City Council's health committee voted 6-0 to
ban cigarette machines in stores, fast-food outlets and most other
public places. The proposal must still be approved by the full
council and Mayor David Dinkins.
   Both measures are among the toughest anti-smoking proposals in
the country.
   ``We know that most smokers get hooked on the addictive quality
of tobacco when they are young,'' said New York City Councilman
Joseph Lisa, chairman of the health committee.
   The measure would allow cigarette machines to remain in taverns,
in hotel and motel bars and other establishments not open to
everyone.
   Masloff said Pittsburgh officials didn't ban the machines
because they feared the courts would rule such action
unconstitutional.
   She said the vending machine industry has indicated it will
challenge the new law, designed to remedy the way cigarettes are
available to practically anyone with loose change.
   ``Until a court tells the industry otherwise, it will have to
comply with the new law when it takes effect or remove their
coin-operated machines from the city,'' she said.

   Valary Shtraks had never ever seen a
Jewish wedding. But the Soviet emigre, like 53 other men, eagerly
stomped a wine glass in a ceremony that had been prohibited when he
wed in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet couples at 30 Philadelphia-area synagogues were married
anew Monday night in religious ceremonies rrganized by Operation
Exodus, an effort by the Federation of Jewish Agencies to help
Soviet Jews settle in the United States.
   The religious ceremonies were held to supplement the secular
weddings the couples had in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's now a complete wedding with the family,'' said Shtraks,
who with Rita, his wife of 13 years, and parents, Lev and Annuta
Shtraks, arrived in this country from the Ukraine 10 months ago.
   Eight couples, including both Shtrakses, exchanged vows at Har
Zion Temple in front of more than 600 congregation members, friends
and relatives. The bridegrooms, wearing yarmulkes, stood under
chuppahs, or wedding canopies, with their brides.
   Rabbi Gerald Wolpe then handed wine glasses wrapped in cloth to
the eight bridegrooms, who stomped the glasses with a festive pop.
Children sang and the audience clapped as the couples danced down
the aisles.
   Wolpe said rabbinical scholars had ruled it was proper to give
the ceremony as if the couples were being married for the first
time.
   ``To these families it is almost a symbol of a reunification of
their people,'' Wolpe said. ``That they can choose the ceremony,
that is such a miracle to them.''
   Another couple, David and Ana Bolotin, said they plan to
celebrate Monday as well as the day they first married 16 years ago
as their wedding anniversary.
   At the Reconstructionist Congregation Or Hadash in nearby
Wyncote, Mark and Natalie Peymer were also married, as were Mark's
parents, Liubov and Semyon Peymer. Both couples came from Leningrad
on March 15.
   ``Now we can have the religious ceremony,'' said the younger
Mrs. Peymer, 20. ``We can have a complete marriage, and be husband
and wife before God.''
   At the Oxford Circle Jewish Community Centre-Brith Israel, Rabbi
J. Harold Romirowsky married five couples before a crowd of about
500.
   ``We are doing this to create a stronger attachment to the
Jewish community by the Russian immigrants. They can make a
contribution to this country,'' he said. Each family was given a
candelabra and a book on Judaism.
   Federation members came up with the idea of celebrating the
immigrants' marriages in freedom last spring, when the Soviets
relaxed their emigration laws.

   A 3-year-old girl whose father committed
suicide rather than watch his family ravaged by AIDS has died of
the disease, a month after her mother.
   The death of Angela Folsom on Sunday left just one survivor in
the family of Jennifer Folsom, who made her battle with AIDS public
this summer to show the disease can strike the traditional family
in rural America.
   Mrs. Folsom's husband, Doug Folsom, committed suicide in June.
His wife said he was unable to bear watching the disease destroy
the family.
   Angela had never learned how to walk and moved in with her
grandparents after her mother died Sept. 3.
   ``She was just worn down,'' said Fred Kenney, her uncle. ``A lot
of it was the transition of losing her mother and moving to another
home.''
   ``I have mixed feelings,'' he said. ``Mostly I'm glad that she's
not in pain anymore, because she had been on morphine. Of course we
hate to see her go.''
   Mrs. Folsom believed she contracted the disease through a blood
transfusion during an emergency appendectomy in 1979. That was
before blood supplies were tested for the virus.
   She was diagnosed with the disease in 1988, and tests later
found that Angela also had AIDS. Another daughter, 5-year-old
Nicolette, has not tested positive for the virus and is the sole
surviving member of the family.
   Kenney said Angela was hospitalized for four days last month
after a feeding tube inserted into her stomach failed to heal
properly. In recent weeks, she had received 24-hour nursing care.
   ``Over the last three or four weeks she deteriorated just the
way Jennifer did,'' Kenney said.
   Kenney said Nicolette, who attended her mother's funeral, is
living with her grandparents but may move in with an aunt and
cousin.
   He said an art therapist visits Nicolette twice weekly. The girl
once drew a picture of the sky with a rope hanging down to the
house. She told her mother it was God sending a rope for Angela.
   But shortly after her father's suicide, Nicolette amended the
caption, saying, ``It was for Daddy.''
   ``She feels that she still has family,'' Kenney said. ``I'm just
hoping my parents can get through it and we'll go on from there.''

   The dollar rose slightly in European trading today
as dealers awaited fresh U.S. economic news or a development of
events in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold dropped slightly.
   Dealers said a general decline in other high-yielding currencies
is likely to support the dollar in the short term.
   But, the dealers said, they are uncertain whether the U.S.
currency will be able to hold its own for much longer, especially
against the yen.
   ``People are still looking for reasons to sell the dollar,
particularly against the yen,'' said Pat Magill, head of corporate
trading at Daiwa (Europe) Bank Ltd.
   Mark Sexton, senior dealer at Bank of Montreal in London, said
the dollar now is starting to look cheap against the German mark.
   Overall, dealers said, the dollar is likely to trade in a narrow
range as the market waits for fresh U.S. economic news or an
escalation of tensions in the Persian Gulf, where an international
force has been massing since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 128.05 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 128.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5255 German marks, up from 1.5230
   -1.2875 Swiss francs, up from 1.2870
   -5.1138 French francs, up from 5.1035
   -1.7205 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7165
   -1,143.50 Italian lire, up from 1,141.50
   -1.1569 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1520
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9415, compared
with $1.9545 late Monday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$375.15 per ounce at mid-morning, from $379.75 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.45, down from $379.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $8.75 to close at a bid
$376.33.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.22 a troy ounce,
the same as Monday's close.

<HEAD>Afrikaner Leader Claims Thousands Moving to Proposed White State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afrikaner leader who wants
to establish an independent white homeland claims that more than
12,000 families have signed up to settle in the proposed state.
   Carel Boshoff, who leads the Afrikaner Volkswag party, says the
group expects to ask the government early next year for official
recognition of it right to an independent homeland.
   He told the government-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
Monday that talks with the government are already under way.
   ``We want to emphasize that we do not need confrontation. That's
why we are negotiating with the government,'' he told SABC
television.
   Boshoff envisions an Afrikaner state in the northwestern Cape
region, a sparsely populated and underdeveloped area. Afrikaners,
descendants of Dutch settlers, could become a majority in the
region by hiring only other Afrikaners and not having to rely on
black labor, he says.
   Boshoff said 90 families have settled in the proposed state and
that more than 12,000 families from across South Africa have signed
up to settle in the region.
   Afrikaner Volkswag organizes interested settlers into ``trek
groups,'' then searches for jobs or business opportunities for them
in the planned settlement area.

   Security forces said today that they
killed 17 Moslem militants caught crossing into India from
Pakistan, and two border guards were killed and 10 wounded in
ambushes.
   Fires destroyed about 200 shops and homes in several towns and
villages near the cease-fire line as skirmishes continued today,
witnesses said.
   Two charred bodies were found in the village of Shabnag, about
40 miles north of Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir
state, Press Trust of India reported.
   Moslem militants are seeking independence for Jammu and Kashmir,
the only state in Hindu-dominated India with a Moslem majority.
About 1,400 people have been killed since India cracked down on the
insurgency last January.
   Government officials said the militants shot near the cease-fire
line were in the Kupwara district. They did not give details of the
fighting or an exact location.
   Two border guards were killed and four wounded while patrolling
the village of Sangrama, police sources told the United News of
India news agency.
   Fire brigade officials said they had reports of more than 100
buildings in flames in the town of Trehgam, including a mosque.
   The officials in Srinigar said continuing clashes prevented
firefighters from reaching several villages where fires were
reported early Tuesday.
   A reporter was turned back outside the apple market town of
Sopor, where firemen said 15 houses were ablaze. Gunfire could be
heard in the distance.
   United News of India said the buildings caught fire during an
exchange of gunfire between militants and security forces. Three
security men were wounded in ambushes there Monday, it said.

<TEXT>
   A woman has sued the Boy Scouts of America,
claiming advertisements in its magazine contributed to her
12-year-old son's accidental shooting death in 1988.
   Jan Way of Forth Worth maintains a 16-page advertisement in the
September 1988 issue of Boys Life ``influenced and motivated'' her
son, Rocky William Miller, and other boys to experiment with a
bullet and rifle.
   The National Shooting Sports Foundation and Remington Arms
Company Inc., were also named as defendants in the lawsuit filed in
Dallas County District Court. They were listed as sponsors of the
advertisements.
   The lawsuit said Miller died Nov. 19, 1988, after several boys
found an old gun and a .22 cartridge and accidently shot him. It
said the boys had read the shooting supplements and
``particularly'' an advertisement by Remington.
   Lee Sneath, national spokesman for the Boy Scouts, said he could
not comment on the lawsuit. But he said ``the editorial content as
well as a majority of the ads in that advertising supplement stress
responsibility and safety.''
   Remington spokesman Paul Kbederis also said he could not
comment. ``We have not been served with the suit, so we have no
knowledge of the allegations,'' he said.
   Dallas lawyer Windle Turley said the lawsuit sought to stop the
Boy Scouts from ``promoting shooting and the sale of ammunitions
and firearms to impressionable youth.''
   Turley said the amount of damages has not been determined, but
they would be in the millions.

   Hooked on that pet fish of yours?
Want to keep him in the swim of things as long as you can? Just
send him to the fish doctor for a checkup.
   More people are doing that these days, said Hugh Bishop, editor
of Pets Supplies Marketing magazine, as word spreads that
veterinarians can now treat fish with bath solutions and shots and
even perform surgery on them.
   ``Fish are obviously something people do develop an affinity for
and would look for some help if they develop a problem,'' Bishop
said.
   He also noted that some people pay as much as $1,000 each for
exotic fish.
   John A. Shadduck, dean of Texas A&amp;M's school of veterinary
medicine, said fish studies have been added to his school's
programs.
   ``It's part of our overall attempt to do two things: diversify
veterinary medicine and address a societal need,'' he said.
   But not everyone at the university thinks fish are best kept as
pets.
   Student Roger Parker, who works in food safety, said the only
treatment he usually gives fish is ``over a frying pan.''

   The home of U.S. House Minority Leader
Robert H. Michel was vandalized with graffiti that expressed
displeasure with the federal deficit and tax proposals facing
lawmakers.
   Michel's spokesman labeled the vandalism disgusting and said the
congressman was angry and disappointed by the attack.
   For the second time in nine months, a vandal painted anti-tax
messages across the front of Michel's house of more than 35 years,
located in this Illinois River city just west of downtown.
   ``Cut Taxes, Deficit'' and ``Repeal - Stolen Pay Raise'' were
sprayed in green paint on the front of the home. A dollar sign, in
the same green color, was painted on the door.
   ``It's one thing for people to disagree with you on the issues
of the day, but to take it out on personal property, it's kind of
disgusting,'' said Ray LaHood, chief of staff for Michel.
   Michel was in Washington at the time of the incident, which
police said happened between 1 p.m. Saturday and 7:30 a.m. Sunday.
   The first message appeared to be a comment on the raging deficit
debate in Congress and a proposed five-year, $500 billion deficit
reduction plan that Michel supported.
   The second apparently refers to Michel's support for a pay raise
for members of Congress and the executive branch approved last
December.
   No one was arrested in the incident and police had no suspects.
   LaHood said the latest graffiti will be removed in a couple
days.
   Michel is unopposed in his bid for re-election to a 18th term in
the House. The 33-year veteran of Congress has been Republican
floor leader since 1980.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit by Man Whose Comatose Wife Had Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who won the right to order an
abortion for his comatose wife cannot sue the hospital and two
anti-abortion activists for damages, a judge has ruled.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harry Hunter on Monday dismissed the
$10 million suit filed by Martin Klein, who sought the abortion
after doctors told him it might help his wife's chances for
recovery.
   The judge also found that Klein's suit against North Shore
University Hospital was ``clearly retaliatory,'' and said the
hospital was entitled to have its legal fees reimbursed.
   Hunter set a hearing for Nov. 7 to determine the amount.
   Klein's lawyer, Jay Dankner, said an appeal was likely if Klein
is penalized at that hearing.
   The suit, filed in Nassau County in June 1989, said the hospital
and activists John Short and John Broderick caused ``emotional
distress'' - and cost Klein more than $50,000 in legal fees - in
court battles over whether the abortion could be performed.
   But Hunter ruled Monday that the hospital ``acted properly'' in
refusing to allow the abortion unless Klein was appointed his
wife's legal guardian by a judge.
   The judge also found that Short and Broderick's actions ``did
not rise to the level of `extreme and outrageous conduct.'''
   In fact, Hunter wrote, they ``effectively protected Nancy
Klein's interests.''
   ``I feel vindicated because the court agreed with us that any
time one defends life he is doing the right thing,'' Short said.
   Mrs. Klein, who was about four months pregnant, was injured and
left comatose in a car accident in December 1988.
   Klein went to court in January seeking guardianship, but
Broderick and Short challenged him, losing each time but appealing
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court refused to
hear the case.
   Mrs. Klein, 34, eventually emerged from the coma and lives at a
rehabilitation center in Oyster Bay, Dankner said. She is able to
communicate and makes frequent trips home to be with her husband
and daughter, he said.

   The pre-dawn outing caught some White House aides by surprise.
They scrambled to arrange the standard motorcade of staff and media

   But Bush left without reporters shortly after 6 a.m. and was
well into his run by the time the press caught up with him at the
Des Moines Water Works park. He called out a greeting and continued
running.
   It was dark when he began and dark when he finished. There was

bright stars.
   Bush was in Iowa to raise campaign funds for Branstad and other

<HEAD>Former PTL Aides Get Reduced Sentence For Testifying Against
Bakker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has reduced the prison sentences
of two former PTL aides who testified against Jim Bakker.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter cut five years from the
sentences of both James and David Taggart, who are serving time for
tax evasion at Maxwell Air Force Base prison camp in Montgomery,
Ala.
   The Taggarts testified against the former PTL leader during
Bakker's trial. Bakker, convicted last October of mail fraud, wire
fraud and conspiracy, is serving a 45-year prison sentence in
Minnesota.
   ``These defendants' testimony was not crucial in the prosecution
of Bakker,'' Potter wrote. ``However, I believe it can be said that
their testimony was helpful.''
   Even with the sentence reductions, David Taggart is still
serving 13 years, 5 months. James Taggart's new sentence is 12
years, 9 months. They likely will not be eligible for parole for
four years.
   Potter's five-page order was issued Friday.
   David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and James Taggart,
PTL's former interior decorator, were convicted in July 1989 of tax
evasion and conspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection.
   They were accused of using more than $1.1 million in PTL money
to pay their personal bills and of not reporting that income or
paying $525,000 in income taxes from 1984 to 1987.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As soldiers and their war machines mass
across the desert in Saudi Arabia poised for battle with Iraq, the
people of Baghdad seem to merely shrug and go about their business.
   Restaurants on the banks of the Tigris River are full until at
least 9 p.m., serving their speciality of baked fish.
   After dinner, people retire to bars, which are open a couple of
hours longer. Streets lights keep the city aglow through the night.
   There's little indication that the people of this city of 4.5
million feel threatened by the possibility of war over Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Some say it's fatalism, or perhaps a sense of invicibility.
   ``It's a strange, psychological buildup where many just can't
perceive that anyone can attack Baghdad,'' an Asian diplomat said
on condition of anonymity. ``There is either a total
non-comprehension of the seriousness of the situation - or many
Iraqis just don't care.''
   On an Iraqi Airways flight from Amman, Jordan, Iraqi children
clapped and chanted ``Watan, Watan'' - ``homeland, homeland'' - as
the Boeing 737 touched down at Baghdad's Saddam Hussein
International Airport.
   ``Do you see a war fear?'' asked an Iraqi businessman returning
from Amman, the only city still connecting Baghdad with the rest of
the world following the U.N. air and sea blockade in retaliation
for the invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We are prepared for war but not afraid of it,'' he said.
   In downtown Baghdad, another Iraqi pointed to the window pane in
his office. ``Look at this,'' he said. ``During the war with Iran,
we used to tape them so that splinters don't come, but now there is
no tape.''
   Baghdad residents proudly tell how they lived through eight
years of war with Iran. Many don't seem to sense similar hardship
or danger in the face of the arsenal at the disposal of the
U.S.-led multinational forces camped in Saudi Arabia and patrolling
the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.
   ``You may call it Arab sense of fatalism,'' said an Iraqi, who
like most people here spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They're used to the atmosphere of crisis, but maybe they are
underestimating the real power of the soldiers sitting across the
border,'' he said. ``At least I know that if a war breaks out, it
will not be one of the weekend skirmishes. It will be serious, but
aren't we prepared?''
   Iraq's army newspaper, Al-Qadissiya, today discounted the
possiblity of war before Christmas, saying President Bush was not
likely to allow American soldiers to come home in coffins during
the holiday season.
   There is little visible civil defense preparedness in Baghdad,
where txis fill the streets by the hundreds. Very few soldiers are
seen, except to check a passing vehicle occasionally.
   On Sunday, there was a wedding party at the Sheraton Hotel
complete with a Western-style band and dancing. The women, many
with glittering jewelry and brightly colored silk and synthetic
dresses, swirled slowly around the floor with men in suits and
ties.
   Despite the calm, there's still the sense of unease that has
been a hallmark of Baghdad for years.
   Spontaneous laughter is rarely heard. No one seems to joke.
There are no foreign newspapers, books or magazines. Facsimile and
telex machines are forbidden. Overseas telephone calls must be
placed through operators at the local exchange.
   The two-channel televison is full of reports of support for
President Saddam Hussein and programs on how to grow more
vegetables and raise poultry.
   Food markets are open and doing steady business, but there are
few takers at shops selling shoes and clothing.
   In the bazaar, shops still have stocks of canned food, including
beef, corn and peas. Fruit, mostly apples and oranges, is much
scarcer. Pepsi Cola seems to be everywhere.
   Life-saving drugs have disappeared from pharmacies since the
blockade was imposed, and the government has rationed nine items:
rice, sugar, wheat, cooking oil, tea, soap, laundry detergent,
dried beans and powdered milk.
   Each Iraqi can purchase a monthly allotment that includes 9
pounds of wheat, 3 pounds each of sugar, rice and cooking oil, one
bar of soap and 6 pounds of powdered milk.
   Arab bread, flat and about the size of a big pancake, is limited
to three pieces per person a day at government cooperatives.
   ``The food shortages are affecting, no doubt, but it is not
biting yet,'' one Iraqi said. ``We are getting used to the idea of
eating less than the body needs. At the same time, no one is dying
of hunger and there is no fighting over food.''

<HEAD>New Haven Register CEO Dismissed As More Layoffs Loom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Haven Register's chief executive
officer was dismissed after clashing with the company's new owners
over their decision to lay off more employees.
   Thomas P. Geyer, 43, opposed the additional layoffs, the second
round this month, because he believed they would seriously weaken
the newspaper, a company executive said Monday.
   ``I disagree with that 100 percent, and that's why he is not
here,'' said Robert M. Jelenic, president and chief executive
officer of the Journal Register Co., of Princeton, N.J.
   The Journal Register is a holding company of the New York
investment firm of E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., which acquired the
Register and other U.S. newspapers from Ralph Ingersoll II in July.
   Jelenic said workers would be laid off today in every
department, but he declined to give a number. He said the reason
was the region's economic slump and sagging advertising revenues.
   ``Business is bad,'' he said.
   Geyer, who joined the New Haven daily in 1986, had been a
longtime Ingersoll associate.
   He did not immediately return a telephone call Monday night to
his home.
   The Register laid off 19 employees Oct. 3, and announced that
nine vacant positions would be eliminated. Eleven of the employees
who lost their jobs earlier this month worked in the newsroom.
   Jelenic said today's layoffs would be the last round and that
the company is taking other steps to reduce costs. He told news
employees those steps would include reducing the amount of space
for news stories in the Register, Connecticut's second-largest
daily.
   He emphasized the Register remains the biggest and most
profitable newspaper in the Journal Register Co., formerly
Ingersoll Publications. The Register has a circulation of more than
100,000 daily.
   Jelenic said a new chief executive officer for the Register
would be named in a few weeks.
   Geyer's first newspaper job was at an Ingersoll paper in
Pennsylvania, The Mercury in Pottstown, where he went to work after
college. After working as managing editor of a weekly trade
newspaper he rejoined Ingersoll in 1974 to become editor of the
Claremont (N.H.) Eagle Times.
   He was named chief operating officer of Ingersoll in 1981.
   In 1986, Geyer was named editor of the Register and
Journal-Courier. His first job was to oversee the consolidation of
the morning Journal-Courier and evening Register.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the text of the
citation issued in English by the Swedish Academy of Sciences for
the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The prize went
to Americans Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller and William Sharpe for
their work in the theory of financial economics.
   ---&equals;
   Financial markets serve a key purpose in a modern market economy
by allocating productive resources among various areas of
production. It is to a large extent through financial markets that
saving in different sectors of the economy is transferred to
companys for investments in buildings and machines. Financial
markets also reflect companys' expected prospects and risks, which
implies that risks can be spread and that savers and investors can
acquire valuable information for their investment decisions.
   The first pioneering contribution in the field of financial
economics was made in the 1950s by Harry Markowitz, who developed a
theory for households' and companys' allocation of financial assets
under uncertainty, the so-called theory of portfolio choice. This
theory analyzes how wealth can be optimally invested in assets that
differ in regard to their expected return and risk, and thereby
also how risks can be reduced.
   A second significant contribution to the theory of financial
economics occurred during the 1960s when a number of researchers,
among whom William Sharpe was the leading figure, used Markowitz's
portfolio theory as a basis for developing a theory of price
formation for financial assets, the so-called Capital Asset Pricing
Model, or CAPM.
   A third pioneering contribution to financial economics concerns
the theory of corporate finance and the evaluation of companys' on
markets. The most important achievements in this field were made by
Merton Miller, initially in collaboration with Franco Modigliani
(who received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
in 1985 mainly for other contributions). This theory explains the
relation (or lack of one) between companys' capital asset structure
and dividend policy on one hand and their market value on the
other.

   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney opened talks
today with his Soviet counterpart on cooperation in the Persian
Gulf crisis and the long-term course of economic and political
reforms in the Soviet Union.
   Cheney and U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, flying on an Air Force
Boeing 707, were welcomed at Sheremyetevo Airport by the defense
minister, Marshal Dmitri Yazov, and a Soviet military band.
   ``I look forward over the next few days to have the opportunity
to visit with members of the Soviet armed forces and to exchange
views with Marshal Yazov and other Soviet officials about important
world issues that face both our two nations at the present time,''
Cheney said on arrival.
   During the four-day visit, he is to meet with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. He will
also inspect an elite airborne unit, an air defense command post
and a factory that produces MiG-29 jet fighters.
   Yazov visited similar military posts during a trip to the United
States a year ago.
   Cheney, speaking with reporters on the flight from London, said
he would ask Gorbachev and his aides ``to explain what they are
talking about in their long-term plans'' for economic and political
reform.
   The defense secretary, a longtime hard-liner toward the Soviet
Union, said he had reached no conclusions on whether Gorbachev's
reforms would transform the country.
   But he praised the announcement Monday that Gorbachev had won
the Nobel Peace Prize, saying ``I think it is appropriate.''
   Cheney also told reporters on the plane he had no specific
requests of the Soviets in the standoff with Iraq.
   ``They've got to make their own decisions,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union has not joined the multinational force, but has
supported its deployment and the embargo.
   Shevardnadze on Monday told Soviet lawmakers that the Kremlin
had no plans ``for participation in a military operation'' and
assured them that any such deployment would require their approval.
   Cheney said the United Stats was prepared for a ``long haul''
in the gulf and that troops would remain deployed there for as long
as necessary.
   He rejected the notion of a quick strike or any deadline for
economic sanctions to succeed in forcing Iraq to end its
10-week-old occupation of Kuwait.
   ``No one should make the mistake of assuming this is the kind of
operation which will be over in a very short period of time,''
Cheney told reporters Monday at a news conference in London.
   ``The United States is prepared for the long haul if that is
what it takes to get the job done,'' he said.
   In London, Cheney met with British Defense Secretary Tom King
and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   From Moscow, Cheney will continue to Paris for the conclusion of
his 10-day mission.

<TEXT>
   The army today set up a checkpoint
outside the French Embassy where defeated Christian Gen. Michel
Aoun took refuge, heightening Lebanon's diplomatic quarrel with
France over Aoun's fate.
   Government bulldozers continued removing mines and earth mounds
along the five-mile Green Line that divides Beirut into Christian
and Moslem sections. Workers on Monday opened one key intersection,
the Galerie Semaan crossing, and motorists honked horns in
jubilation as they drove through.
   Several Cabinet ministers today compared the planned dismantling
of the Green Line to the removal of the Berlin Wall.
   The unification of the war-torn Lebanese capital is the next
step following Saturday's end to Aoun's 11-month mutiny. Aoun's
troops were crushed in a Syrian-led assault.
   France granted Aoun asylum Saturday, and French President
Francois Mitterrand called the decision Monday ``a matter of
honor.''
   But Lebanese Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul said the
government was determined to bring him to trial and have asked the
French to turn him over.
   The army posted an armored personnel carrier and 12 soldiers,
one equipped with tear gas canisters, on a checkpoint about 300
feet from the embassy in east Beirut.
   French diplomats said the measure amounted to a siege. The
French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted diplomats as saying
large numbers of troops surrounded the embassy and closed all
approaches.
   Reporters on the scene said the small checkpoint made no move to
stop people from leaving or entering the embassy or block traffic
in its vicinity.
   Presidential spokeswoman May Kahhaleh said the ckeckpoint was
set up to prevent anti-Aoun demonstrations near the embassy.
   ``It's purely a security measure to protect the embassy, not to
blockade it,'' Ms. Kahaleh said.
   French Ambassador Rene Ala met President Elias Hrawi twice
Monday to discuss the impasse over Aoun.
   Civilians started returning to Aoun's former enclave in the
Christian area to repair damage caused during the Lebanese-Syrian
assault.
   Lebanese army engineering units continued work along the Green
Line, the five-mile line that has divided the capital into Moslem
and Christian sectors since the outbreak of civil war in 1975.
   ``Berlin has been united and has gotten rid of the wall that had
divided it for many years. Now it's Beirut being united with the
Green Line ceasing to exist,'' Dalloul was quoted by local radio
stations as saying.
   The government aims at creating a militia-free ``Greater
Beirut,'' which covers Beirut's Christian and Moslem sectors and
their immediate suburbs, to be policed only by government troops.
   The main obstacles are the Christian, Shiite and Druse Moslem
militias.
   Police said some of the civilians who fled Aoun's former enclave
returned today to repair their damaged property, despite reports
that leftist and Moslem militias were kidnapping Christians.
   The Lebanese army's military police were `trying to keep the
situation under control and protect civilians,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with regulations.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, said the government
now ``has enough power to enforce implementation of (last year's)
peace pact which calls for disbanding all militias.''
   ``I hope that the government will not be obliged to resort to
force to implement this.'' he said.
   He said Dalloul and Defense Minister Albert Mansour were asked
to ``set the mechanism'' for disbanding the various militias. He
did not elaborate.
   Aoun had rejected the peace plan agreed to last year that
distributed power equally between Moslems and Christians. He
refused to accept the November election of Hrawi by members of
Parliament and rebelled.
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon. It has 40,000 troops
in the country, deployed in predominantly Moslem regions.
   Aoun's main objection to the peace plan was that it failed to
include a timetable for a Syrian withdrawal.

<HEAD>Three May Have Been Victims of Asian Gang Turf War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of a Vietnamese gang known as Born
to Kill were shot to death, and police said the slayings may stem
from turf wars with longer established Chinese gangs.
   The victims, all in their early 20s but not immediately
identified, were found shot in the head at dawn Monday in an
outdoor parking lot about three blocks from City Hall.
   Investigators found three .380-caliber shell casings at the
scene, said Officer Scott Bloch, a department spokesman.
   He said one of the victims had a tattoo of BTK, for Born to
Kill, and a second bore a tattoo that he described as ``associated
with BTK.''
   In a widely publicized incident late in July, gunmen posing as
mourners at the New Jersey burial of a BTK member from Chinatown
opened fire with several weapons. Seven of the 100 or so people
there for the burial were wounded by gunfire, and seven more were
injured in the panic.
   On Oct. 1, a 27-year-old Vietnamese man was shot to death when
at least two gunmen sprayed a crowded Chinatown street with more
than a dozen rounds of 9mm bullets. Police said the slain man was a
member of a gang other than BTK but his killers may have been from
BTK, a robbery and extortion gang.

<TEXT>
   A former millionaire entrepreneur claims in a
bankruptcy lawsuit that he is a partner in New Kids on the Block
and is entitled to $5 million in the pop group's profits.
   Jeffrey Furst, who filed for bankruptcy protection early this
year, said in his suit that New Kids co-producer Maurice Starr
promised Furst and Furst's one-time business partner, James M.
Martorano, each a 25 percent interest in the pop group in return
for a loan.
   Starr denied that Furst or Martorano had any partnership in the
group. He said he, co-producer Richard Scotts, and the five members
of New Kids are the only ones with a stake in the group.
   Documents released Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court lawsuit
include an affidavit by David Jemmott, a state trooper on a leave
of absence, that Starr and Furst agreed during a 1988 meeting to be
50-50 partners in the group and shook hands on it.
   In another affidavit, Middlesex County Sheriff John McGonigle
said Starr told him that he and Furst were partners when McGonigle
posed with the New Kids for a photograph.
   In the court papers, Furst said Barry Rosenthal, an attorney for
New Kids, oversaw a loan of $175,000 to Starr and drew up corporate
documents for Furst and Starr.
   Furst contends that last December, when he needed money, Starr
told him he was not a partner because they had not signed a written
agreement.
   Starr said he did get a $175,000 loan from Furst but paid it
back at an interest rate of about 30 percent.
   Starr said two corporations, Furst-Starr Management Inc. and
Furst-Starr Productions, were legally dissolved.
   But the secretary of state's office said Monday the corporations
have not been legally dissolved. The incorporation papers said the
corporations were formed to represent and furnish entertainers and
performers.
   Len Lewin, another lawyer for New Kids, said the group is
managed by Dick Scott Entertainment Inc., and that New Kids has
nothing to do with Furst-Starr Management Inc.

<TEXT>
   The governing center-right coalition -
in power for only six months - fared poorly in local elections over
the weekend, while opposition liberal parties made gains, results
showed.
   Turnout for Sunday's voting was low as Hungarians went to the
polls for the sixth time in less than a year. It averaged 27
percent in rural Hungary and 36 percent in Budapest.
   In the first round of the local elections Sept. 30, less than
the required 40 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in
municipalities of more than 10,000 residents. On Sunday, there was
no required minimum turnout.
   Local elections were the last hurdle as Hungary completed
passage from a single-party state to a multiparty democracy.
Hungary began its move away from 40 years of Communist Party rule
in a democratic revolution late last year.
   In towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants, the vote was
conclusive Sept. 30. More than 80 percent of the mayors and
two-thirds of the new council members chosen in those communities
ran as independents.
   Many held office under Communist rule, and their victories were
seen as reflecting discontent with the parties now in power and
Hungary's worsening economic situation.
   In larger communities, the main opposition liberal party, the
Alliance of Free Democrats, and the more radical League of Young
Democrats made gains Sunday. But the center-right governing
coalition led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum failed to win wide
support.
   Of the individual constituencies, 302 were won by the Free
Democrats, 142 by the Young Democrats, and 289 by a Free Democrat
and Young Democrat alliance.
   Independents won 264 constituencies, the Forum won 195, and its
coalition partners the Smallholders and Christian Democrats won 108
and 82 respectively. Recounts are planned in five constituencies.
   Up for election in the larger communities was a variety of local
offices. Some voters cast ballots for lists of candidates for local
councils. In some cases, the councils will chose the local
officials.
   In the first free nationwide elections in March and April, the
Forum gained 165 seats in Parliament, the Smallholders 43 and the
Christian Democrats 21. The Free Democrats won 92, the Young
Democrats 21 and the Socialist Party 33 seats.
   The big prize Sunday was Budapest, where local councils elected
Sunday will choose the mayor. Free Democrat Gabor Demszky, a lawyer
and veteran dissident under the Communists, appeared the
frontrunner in that dispute.
   The official result in the Budapest mayoral dispute will be
announced later this month.

   Nelson Mandela today welcomed the
abolition of a basic law of South African apartheid but said the
main issue toward ending segregation is allowing the black majority
to vote.
   The South African black leader spoke at a news conference on the
first stop of a three-week Asian tour. He was greeted Monday in
India with the pomp usually reserved for heads of state.
   Monday's end to a 37-year-old law that segregated South African
public facilities was ``a step forward,'' Mandela said. But until
equal voting rights are achieved, ``any other change will remain
peripheral,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela told a rally of 20,000 people Monday that the
black-against-black violence in his homeland emanates from the
``war psychosis'' of living under apartheid.
   Mandela warned the clashes could undermine efforts to begin
negotiations with the white minority government on ending the
system of racial segregation.
   About 800 people have been killed since August in fighting
between followers of Mandela's African National Congress and the
rival Inkatha movement of Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The latest flare-ups were in the black townships around
Johannesburg and in the eastern province of Natal. The rivalry has
claimed about 5,000 lives since 1986.
   He said the violence ``promotes white privileges and domination.
It engenders differences over a common humanity. It is calculated
to weaken the ANC and abort the process of achieving a peaceful
resolution of the conflict created and maintained by apartheid,''
he said.
   Mandela's Asian tour began in India, where he said the worldwide
movement against apartheid was conceived.
   In 1954, India became the first country to sever diplomatic
relations with South Africa and to impose trade and travel
restrictions.
   Mandela paid tribute to Mohandas K. Gandhi, who began developing
his strategy of non-violent resistance during his 21 years in South
Africa.
   Gandhi, then a young Indian lawyer, founded the Natal Indian
Congress in 1894 to press for the rights of Indians, descended from
indentured servants brought to work the sugarcane fields. He left
South Africa in 1914 and led India's campaign for independence from
Britain.
   Mandela said the anti-apartheid movement was ``based on the
Gandhian philosophy.''
   Mandela was released from prison in February after 27 years
internment for plotting the overthrow of the government. He was
elected the ANC's deputy president.
   Indian leaders pledged Monday to keep up pressure on the
government of President F.W. de Klerk until it adopted irrevocable
steps toward dismantling apartheid.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh gave Mandela a check for $800,000 and
said more money was being set aside for aid to his movement, news
agencies reported.
   Following his trip to India, Mandela is to visit Brunei,
Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia, returning home Nov. 4.

<HEAD>4-Year-Old Left Alone Calls Wisconsin Looking For Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old girl, left home alone
with a bad cold, was found by police after she randomly dialed a
Wisconsin county's Health Department in an effort to reach her
mother.
   ``I don't know how she did it,'' said Sarah Weeks, a
receptionist at the the Health Department in Walworth County, a
farming area east of Wisconsin's capital of Madison. ``It's pretty
miraculous.''
   Police Monday charged the girl's mother, 27-year-old Luvisca
Deligny, with leaving a child unattended, a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of up to $500 and a 30-day jail term.
   Deligny said she left her daughter with a roommate while she
went to the bank. Police said the mother's roommate left the child
alone when they had to go to work.
   The girl, whose name was not released, began dialing random
telephone numbers to try to find her mother. She reached the
Walworth County ``Public Health Line'' about 9:30 a.m.
   ``It was real quiet at first,'' Weeks said. ``Then there was
this little voice saying, `Hi.' She talked about her mom and that
she wasn't there.''
   For the next two hours, Weeks kept her little caller busy
singing nursery rhymes and other songs, while authorities traced
the call to the Washington area and notified Montgomery County
police.
   About 11:30 a.m., Montgomery County police officers found the
girl in a ground-floor apartment.
   Mother and daughter were reunited at the police station.
   Interviewed by telephone by The Washington Post, the girl said:
``I said, let me call somebody. I was going to call my mommy. I
wanted to tell her I was all alone.''
   Deligny said she took the day off to care for her sick child and
had left to run an errand.
   ``I'm still not sure she was on the phone that long,'' she said.
``I'll wait to see the phone bill to determine if it's true.''

<TEXT>
   Rival Zulus and Xhosas armed
with spears and knives clashed at a coal mine in a factional fight
that left 10 people dead and 52 others injured, police and the
company said today.
   A police spokesman said the fighting began late Monday at
Hlobane Colliery near Vryheid in northern Natal province. The area
has been a battleground between conservative Zulu forces and
followers of the African National Congress.
   A group of Zulus went on a rampage in the workers' quarters at
the mine, attacking rival Xhosas, the spokesman said on condition
of anonymity. The groups fought with knives, axes and spears, he
said.
   Police said they did not know what started the clash.
   ISCOR, the state-run iron and steel corporation that operates
the mine, said in a statement that 32 people were admitted to a
Vryheid hospital and 20 people were at the mine hospital.
   It said production has been temporarily halted at the mine while
management tries to resolve the differences between the groups.
   The fight followed a clash in Johannesburg in which eight people
died. The incidents marked a renewed outbreak of black factional
violence after several weeks of relative calm.
   More than 800 people were killed in factional fighting between
Zulus of the Inkatha movement and ANC supporters in black townships
around Johannesburg in August and September.
   Police also said today that two men and one woman were killed in
unrest in other parts of Natal during the past 24 hours. One of the
men died when two groups armed with spears fought at a bus station
in Empangeni.
   In other developments, police in the black Kwazulu homeland said
43 people were slain over the weekend. The report did not say how
many of the deaths were politically motivated.
   Kwazulu, a semi-autonomous black homeland, is administered by
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha movement.
   South African news reports said the clash Monday in Johannesburg
began when a mini-bus filled with armed men attacked a workers
compound near the Kempton Park district.
   The attackers, some of whom were wearing masks, opened fire on
sleeping workers with automatic weapons, the reports said.
   Unidentified men in mini-buses were blamed for starting much of
the fighting in the Johannesburg area last month. ANC leaders
charged the attackers were linked to the security forces and were
trying to fan black violence.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government and police commanders have
denied the ANC charges.
   The government imposed curfews and introduced strict security
last month in black townships around Johannesburg hit by factional
fighting. Curfews had been lifted in some areas and security
relaxed in recent days as the fighting appeared to have ended.
   Police commanders said today that they were keeping a close
watch on the violence and would increase security to prevent its
spread.
   The fighting has pitted Inkatha against Xhosas and other blacks
loyal to the left-leaning ANC. The two sides oppose apartheid, but
differ over goals for a future South Africa, including economic
plans and leadership questions.

   Abdallah Hsein, a bearded auto mechanic, is not
afraid of an Iraqi chemical attack. God, he says, will decide if he
lives or dies.
   Yet, like most of the 5,000 Arabs in the south Jerusalem village
of Beit Tsafafa, he stood in line to get his gas mask Monday, the
first day of nationwide distribution of the protective kits.
   Handing out the masks to Palestinians points up the
contradictions the Israeli army faces in dealing with Arabs in
Jerusalem.
   The government considers the residents of Beit Tsafafa Israeli
citizens, but many see themselves as enemies of the Jewish state.
Some youngsters receiving the masks in the Arab village said they'd
been tear-gassed by the army for stoning soldiers.
   The government decided earlier this month to hand out the masks
to Israel's 4.7 million citizens in case Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein makes good on his threats to attack Israel with chemical
weapons.
   Israel today began training Palestinian doctors in the occupied
territories on how to prepare for a chemical attack, officials of
the Israeli military government said.
   Lt. Col. Shmuel Ovenboy, spokesman for the military government,
said the training was launched because Israel is responsible for
the residents under its administration.
   Masks are also being purchased for the 1.7 million Palestinians
in the territories, the army says, although the government has not
announced plans for distributing them there yet.
   Last week, the army tested its distribution network for gas
masks in three small Jewish towns. On Monday, it opened some 400
stations throughout Israel, hoping to distribute two million masks
by the end of the week.
   Residents of Beit Tsafafa trickled into a community cewnter to
be among the first Arabs to get the masks.
   A half-dozen paramilitary border police armed with M-16 assault
rifles and clubs were on guard - a sign that not all is peaceful in
Beit Tsafafa.
   Some houses, half-hidden amid dusty olive trees, flew black
flags from rooftops in mourning for the 19 Arabs killed by police
on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem on Oct. 8.
   ``The killing won't go without revenge,'' said Hsein, the
mechanic who lined up for a mask. ``I don't think any relative of
those harmed in the attack will be satisfied by getting a gas
mask.''
   For Hsein, getting the mask is proving ``our right as Arabs who
are living in Israel and paying taxes.''
   The Arabs of Beit Tsafafa are an acute double loyalty case.
Until Israel captured the Arab sector of Jerusalem in 1967, the
border that divided the city divided the village. One quarter was
Israeli, the rest Jordanian.
   Today, many of the villagers support Saddam. The village has
lost two people in the nearly three-year Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule.
   ``Saddam, O hero, strike with chemicals,'' a cluster of children
defiantly sang into the microphone of an Israel army radio reporter
outside the gas mask distribution center. A boy waved a toy pistol.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip - unlike in Arab
sectors of Jerusalem - Palestinians will have to buy the gas masks.
   Rabiha Alayan, a smiling, dark-haired secretary who lined up for
masks, said she was not afraid of a chemical attack. If it comes
and ``somebody remains on the earth after that,'' she said, ``it
may change the situation in the area, make things better.''
   Mrs. Alayan came to the center only because of her three
children.
   Dozens of children and adults were trying on the masks and
listening to Arab instructors as uniformed army officials handed
out boxes with protective kits.
   Hsein was unimpressed: ``I think these masks will not be good
against Saddam's chemicals,'' he said. ``Even if Saddam attacks
with chemical arms, I'm not afraid. There is God and He decides if
I live or die.''

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP  - A fire destroyed a two-story frame
house near downtown, killing six people, and six counts of murder
were filed today against the husband of one of the victims.
   The fire was reported late Monday by a police officer who
spotted the blaze while on routine patrol, Police Lt. Lorin Mock
said. By the time firefighters arrived, the house was fully
involved in flames, he said.
   The man arrested, whose name was being withheld by police, also
was charged with setting the fire that killed his wife, another
woman, and four children, three girls and a boy, said police
spokesman Asa Higgs, who offered no other details.
   He also was charged with violating an injunction ordering him to
stay away from his wife, Higgs said.
   Investigators did not say how the blaze was started.
   A man sleeping in a car outside the house was able to save a
3-year-old boy, Mock said.

<HEAD>Republican Party Status Threatened In New York</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foundering campaign of Pierre Rinfret
threatens the Republican Party with more than another big loss to
Democrat Mario Cuomo in the New York governor's race.
   Some Republican leaders say there is a chance, albeit slim, that
GOP defections and voter apathy could allow Conservative Party
candidate Herbert London to out-poll Rinfret on Election Day.
   Beyond the psychological blow of a third-place finish for the
Republicans, such an outcome would have practical political
consequences. The GOP would lose its No. 2 ballot spot - Row B - to
the Conservatives for at least the next four years.
   Election experts maintain that higher ballot spots attract more
votes.
   ``It would be absolutely outrageous if the Republican Party were
to drop to Row C,'' said Republican state Sen. Roy Goodman.
   ``I think it's slight, but I think that the possibility of voter
apathy, coupled with some of these defections, does pose a
threat,'' Goodman said.
   GOP leaders also are concerned about the impact on crucial state
Senate races if Rinfret's stumbling campaign causes rank-and-file
Republicans to stay home on Nov. 6.
   Republicans control the state Senate 32-26 with three vacancies.
A Democratic majority in the Senate likely would give the party
complete control over the redrawing of congressional and
legislative districts next year.
   Robert Haggerty, the Senate GOP's chief political strategist,
said party loyalty should protect the GOP ballot status. But he
said the remote possibility that London could best Rinfret was
``something we've got an eye on.''
   Haggerty said that to protect the GOP's ballot spot - and GOP
Senate incumbents - at least $400,000 would be spent on a
get-out-the-vote campaign.
   A September poll by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion found that 60 percent of those surveyed favored Cuomo while
less than 15 percent backed Rinfret. London was at 4 percent.
   However, Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said London may be
picking up strength because of Republican voter dissatisfaction
with Rinfret.
   It's unlikely Republicans will come in third, but ``the only
thing that keeps them in the running at this point is the strength
of the party line,'' Miringoff said.
   Were the Conservatives to claim the second spot on the ballot,
they would be able to fill several hundred patronage jobs on boards
of elections at the state and county levels.
   London joked about that prospect.
   ``There probably aren't enough Conservatives to fill all those
jobs,'' he said.
   There are more than 100,000 enrolled Conservatives in New York,
and about 3.9 million Democrats and 2.6 million Republicans.
   The GOP defections to London include U.S. Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp and Lewis Lehrman, the GOP's unsuccessful candidate for
governor against Cuomo in 1982.
   Rinfret was a politically unknown economist when desperate party
leaders recruited him to run after several prominent party members
declined to challenge Cuomo.
   Last month, Rinfret said his campaign was broke and threatened
to quit the race because party leaders hadn't supported him
politically or financially.
   Rinfret has riled GOP regulars with a series of outspoken
remarks.
   He called Kemp ``a lackey for Governor Cuomo,'' and said state
Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino was ``in bed with Cuomo'' on
raising state taxes and spending. Goodman was labeled ``one of the
most destructive people in the state'' by Rinfret. Rinfret called
other Republicans who refused to run against Cuomo ``gutless
wonders.''
   ``Bizarre behavior,'' said Richard Rosenbaum, a member of the
Republican National Committee.
   Goodman suggested Rinfret needed a rest.
   London has been quick to take advantage of Rinfret's problems.
   ``It looks like something produced by Saturday Night Live,'' he
said of Rinfret's campaign. ``The Republican Party is quite
obviously in desperate shape.''

   A half dozen demonstrators opposed to U.S.
military involvement in the Persian Gulf poured a quart of oil onto
a patio in front of the American Petroleum Institute today to show
support for a Marine who refused to be sent to Saudi Arabia.
   The protesters read a message from the 22-year-old Marine, Cpl.
Jeffrey Paterson, who is confined to his base in Hawaii awaiting a
court-martial.
   Paterson's message urged other Americans to join him in saying:
``Hell, no, we won't go; we won't fight for Texaco.''
   Two counter-demonstrators also showed up.
   David Almasi, who said he worked in a building next door, came
to the lunchtime rally with a handmade sign asking: ``Why did Jeff
Paterson join the Marines? To surf? Or the free paycheck?''
   His companion, Leslie Carbone, carried a Marine Corps flag.
   Paterson supporters said demonstrations als were planned on his
behalf today in San Francisco, Houston, Seattle, Honolulu, New
York, Orlando, Fla., and Australia.
   The protest came just hours after President Bush, on a campaign
trip in Iowa, was interrupted by three young men who urged him to
``bring our troops home.''
   The demonstrators here, who were outnumbered by reporters at one
point, poured the quart of 30-weight motor oil after facing toward
the 9th floor offices of institute and shouting anti-war slogans.
   ``We are here at API because API is the lobbying arm of the oil
industry in the United States and they are asking these young guys
to go and die for the oil industry,'' said Clark Kissinger, a
member of the national council of the organization Refuse &amp; Resist.
   Bill Wordham, a spokesman for API, said the organization would
have no comment.
   Cynthia Briggs, also a member of Refuse &amp; Resist, read the
message from Paterson, in which he said:
   ``There are no guarantees that anything we do will make any
difference at all. ... Maybe the best thing to learn from the
military is that the best defense is a good offense. It's time that
we take the offensive.''
   Paterson, from Hollister, Calif., is apparently the first Marine
to file conscientious objector status to avoid combat duty in the
gulf. He has been confined to his base awaiting trial since a
federal judge ordered him removed from a brig.

<HEAD>Clash Between Rival Groups Kills 10, Injures 52</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   A clash between rival groups
killed 10 people and injured 52 at a northern Natal coal mine as
renewed black factional fighting erupted in South Africa, according
to reports Tuesday.
   Eight other people died in violence linked to the political and
tribal warfare that has gripped black townships near Johannesburg
for two months.
   A police spokesman said fighting between Zulus and Xhosas broke
out late Monday at Hlobane coal mine in northern Natal Province, on
South Africa's east coast. The area has been a battleground between
conservative Zulu forces and followers of the African National
Congress.
   A group of Zulus attacked Xhosas in the workers' quarters at the
mine, the spokesman said on condition of not being identified by
name. He said the groups fought with knives, axes and spears, he
said.
   Police said they did not know what started the clash, which
killed 10 people.
   ISCOR, the state-run iron and steel corporation that operates
the mine, said in a statement that 32 people were admitted to an
area hospital and 20 to the mine hospital.
   It said mine production was temporarily halted while management
tried to resolve the differences between the groups.
   Also Monday, a mini-bus filled with armed men attacked a
workers' compound near the Kempton Park district of Johannesburg,
according to news reports.
   The attackers, some wearing asks, opened fire with automatic
weapons on sleeping workers, the reports said.
   Unidentified men in mini-buses were blamed for starting much of
the fighting in the Johannesburg area last month. ANC leaders
charged the attackers were linked to security forces and trying to
fan black violence.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government and police commanders have
denied the ANC charges.
   More than 800 people were killed in factional fighting between
Zulus of the Inkatha movement and ANC supporters in black townships
around Johannesburg in August and September.
   The fighting had eased in recent weeks after periods in which
dozens of blacks died daily.
   It spread to the Johannesburg area from Natal, where five years
of warfare between the black factions has killed more than 5,000
people.
   Police said Tuesday two men and one woman were killed in
separate unrest incidents in other parts of Natal during the
previous 24 hours. One of the men was killed when two groups armed
with spears fought at a bus station in Empangeni.
   The government imposed curfews and strict security last month in
black townships around Johannesburg hit by faction fighting.
Curfews had been lifted in some areas and security relaxed as the
fighting eased.
   Both Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid but differ over goals
for a future South Africa, including economic plans and leadership
questions.

<TEXT>
   A group of archaeologists is searching
a wooded area minutes from downtown for evidence that Spanish
explorer Hernando DeSoto visited Chattanooga 450 years ago.
   Every weekend, members of the Chattanooga Regional
Anthropological Association head across the Tennessee River from
downtown and sift through the soil at Moccasin Bend for Spanish
artifacts.
   They're looking for proof that DeSoto visited Indians there in
1540 while searching for gold, silver and jewels in a three-year
expedition across the southeastern United States.
   Historians know that the explorer ventured into Tennessee and
that Spaniards made contact with local Indians, but they are not
sure whether the two events coincided.
   ``He either came through the sphere of influence of Chattanooga
just to the east or he marched into it and made contact and perhaps
stayed as long as a month in its towns, dealing with its chieftains
and extorting corn and other provisions for the army,'' said Major
McCollough, association president.
   ``Chattanooga obviously was one of the great focuses of later
Spanish trade and, by implication as much as anything, some of the
earliest contacts. The difficulties are that DeSoto himself only
brought a small inventory of goods to present.''
   The archaeologists, with thig at Hampton Place, a wooded area on Moccasin
Bend that
was the site of one of several Mouse Creek Indian villages that
once dotted the banks of the Tennessee River in southeast
Tennessee.
   The first evidence of Spanish contact at Moccasin Bend was found
in 1915 by an archaeologist named Clarence Moore, who spent a year
digging at sites along the Tennessee River between Paducah, Ky.,
and Knoxville.
   In the 1970s, vandals and grave robbers seeking Indian artifacts
plundered the area across the river from Chattanooga's business
district, leaving craters that still scar the site.
   That prompted the creation of the anthropological association in
1982. The group eventually found enough traces of pottery, stone
tools and arrow points to confirm the village's existence and
configuration.
   Evidence shows Hampton Place contained a plaza, houses, trophy
poles and a burial area, all surrounded by a stockade well in view
of the river, McCollough said.
   ``We knew even from the little bit that was known that it was a
big and important historical complex that nobody had ever taken a
serious look at or tried to define,'' McCollough said.
   In 1986, the 960-acre Moccasin Bend site was designated a
National Historic Landmark. Last year, the state bought nearby
Williams Island and declared it a protected state archaeological
area.
   The association has uncovered about 50 archaeological sites at
the two locations, including the buried remains of Indian houses
that have been dated to 1540 and 1530.
   Both houses yielded Spanish artifacts, and McCollough thinks the
recent discovery of another buried house in the Moccasin Bend
village could produce even mre.
   But even if the National Geographic project, which will run
through next spring, does not find proof of DeSoto's visit,
McCollough said, it won't be a failure.
   ``It's so important, so unusual,'' McCollough said of the
Moccasin Bend site. ``So basically we're just working to have it
understood and protected for the short run - hopefully so its real
value is understood and it has a chance to survive for good.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Steep Increase In Brain Cancer Among Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brain cancer has increased by up to 500
percent among elderly Americans, a trend that an expert at the
National Cancer Institute calls ``alarming'' because the disease is
almost always fatal.
   ``It once was considered that brain tumors reached a peak rate
(among people in their 30s) and then would rapidly decline in the
older population, but it now appears that the incidence continues
to increase with age,'' said Nigel H. Greig, a National Institute
on Aging researcher. ``I think it is alarming.''
   In a study to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute, Greig and three co-authors report that
the rate of brain cancer appears to have increased by up to sixfold
for elderly age groups in 1985 compared to the rates measured from
1973 to 1974.
   For persons aged 75 to 79, the rate increased 187 percent, the
study finds. For those aged 80 to 84, the rate went up by 394
percent, and the rate of increase was 501 percent for those aged 85
and older.
   Primary brain cancer rates showed little change in 1985 among
younger U.S. population groups, said Greig.
   ``In virtually all other age groups, the incidence rates were
approximately the same as in 1974,'' he said. ``But these groups
(the elderly) had a dramatic increase. It is a large rise over a
10-to-15-year period.''
   Brain cancer is relatively rare in the population as a whole,
representing only about 1.5 percent of the total new cancers
diagnosed annually. Each year, there are about 15,000 brain cancer
patients in all age groups.
   Incidence of all types of cancer among all U.S. population
groups rose 10.7 percent during the study period, Greig said.
   The study measured only primary brain tumors - cancers that
started in the brain and were not spread there from tumors
elsewhere in the body. The most common primary brain tumors among
the elderly were glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma, two
extremely dangerous forms of cancer.
   ``It (the brain tumor increase) is alarming from the point of
view that it is a lethal disease with a dismal prognosis,'' said
Greig. ``It is also alarming because treatment is not particularly
good right now. And it's alarming that with the treatment that
there is, the survival time of the elderly is poorer than for the
young patient.''
   Half of all patients are dead of such tumors within 10 months,
he said.
   Improved diagnostic techniques may explain some of the increase
in brain cancers found among the elderly, Greig said. Since the use
of X-ray computed tomography, or CAT scan, became widespread in the
late 1970s, brain tumors are more easily detected. Precise
diagnosis before CAT scans depended upon invasive techniques, such
as intercranial biopsies, that were usually not performed on the
elderly, he said.
   Stanley I. Rapoport, a co-author in the study, said the increase
may also come from a greater interest in the health of the elderly
since the 1970s.
   ``People then essentially gave up on the elderly,'' he said.
``They didn't spend much time evaluating their mental
dysfunction.''
   Now, with a greater interest in Alzheimer's disease, said
Rapoport, doctors tend to seek a precise diagnosis for brain
disease symptoms among the elderly.
   But Greig and Rapoport both said they believe at least part of
the detected increase in brain cancer is not a result of sharper
diagnostics.
   ``We feel that there is a true increase and we're are trying to
determine just what that is,'' said Greig.
   As to the cause, Rapoport said ``there is a possibility that it
is environmental factors to which we are all exposed, but we don't
know that yet.''
   Other co-authors in the study were Lynn G. Ries, of the National
Cancer Institute, and Rosemary Yancik of the National Institutes of
Health.
   The National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer
Institute are both part of the National Institutes of Health.

   Most college graduates have no trouble naming
their alma mater, but four corporate executives did when asked by
Standard and Poors, the national financial rating agency.
   Standard and Poors' latest Executive College Survey lists four
executives as having received degrees from Baltimore City College.
   As Baltimore residents know well, Baltimore City College is a
high school.
   ``We'll do our best to rectify this,'' said Ellen Hartery,
assistant supervisor of Compmark Data Services, the Standard and
Poors subsidiary that compiles the survey.
   The survey is designed to show which colleges graduate the most
people who go on to become corporate executives. It lists roughly
500 colleges and about 54,000 executives, Hartery said Tuesday.
   The survey form asked executives to list their undergraduate and
graduate degrees. Hartery said the number of entries made it
impossible for S&amp;P to verify the information.
   Baltimore City College is accustomed to confusion over its name,
said college spokesman Joseph Antenson.
   ``We get calls several times a day from people wanting to enroll
in graduate programs or people trying to contact the CCB (Community
College of Baltimore),'' Antenson said.

<HEAD>Boot Camp Readies a Few Good Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with pencils and notebooks, 40 raw
recruits have begun political boot camp - a three-week drilling in
campaign tactics such as the sound bite, the fund-raiser and the
media event.
   They are preparing for battle in next year's elections for the
newly empowered and enlarged City Council.
   ``You will work very hard. We will ask a lot of you,'' David
Fleischer, the program's organizer, told the neophytes. ``Saturday
and Sunday will be free for homework'' - writing speeches and
raising money.
   ``But no matter how tough we are here, it won't be as tough as
when you go out and start your campaign,'' he added. ``The more you
get into shape here, the readier you'll be to run and to win.''
   A new city charter gives the council new powers and 16 new
seats, for a total of 51. The program's organizers, a coalition of
good-government and community groups, want to give it some new
blood as well - in recent years only 1.5 percent of incumbents
seeking re-election were defeated.
   The student candidates come from all five boroughs and both
major parties, 65 percent are members of racial minorities, and 55
percent are women.
   They came to class Monday at the Bank Street College of
Education in upper Manhattan looking for information, courage and
eloquence.
   Saleem Shah, 43, a Republican from Harlem, couldn't name his
party's last victory there. He said he wanted to learn about the
new city charter so he can show Harlem voters he can use it to get
more help for their community.
   Anna Capell, an elderly handicapped rights advocate from the
Bronx, uses a wheelchair. ``I have the confidence, but I think they
will embellish it here so I will not be frightened by getting run
over by a political machine,'' she said.
   Tom Gebert's voice cracked the first time he spoke to a group of
parents and teachers at a school board candidate's night in Queens.
Now, at 29, the attorney is ready for a bigger forum, but admitted:
``there's a big difference between speaking to 30 people and
speaking to 300 or 3,000. As the groups get larger, so do your
apprehensions.''
   The candidates will attend a series of lectures and workshops
featuring political pros such as Manhattan Borough President Ruth
Messinger, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, media adviser Jonathan
Schenker, political strategist Joel Bradshaw and election law
expert Jerome Koenig.
   Things they say a candidate should do:
   -Think like a journalist. Write a speech as if you're also
writing a story about it. ``If you don't write the headline and the
lead you want, why should the reporter?'' asks Schenker.
   -Make news, and make it before noon. ``Or at least by 1 p.m.,''
says Schenker. ``By mid-afternoon everyone is editing videotape.''
   -Raise as much money as possible before Jan. 15, the financial
disclosure deadline. ``That's when reporters write their stories,
and you have to have raised enough money by then to demonstrate to
everyone that you're a serious candidate,'' Fleischer says.
   -Think. ``Most campaigns don't,'' says Bradshaw, an adviser to
several Democratic candidates around the nation. ``They think
strategy is deciding whether to have buttons or bumper stickers.''
   Things NOT to do:
   -Waste reporters' time. ``Come up with quotable quotes, and
count the number of words in them,'' says Schenker. ``You can speak
about three words a second and 180 words a minute. For television,
15 to 40 words is quotable.''
   -Look at the camera. ``Look at the interviewer. Television
captures the interaction between people,'' says Schenker. ``And if
you look at the camera, you might not be looking at the right
one.''
   -Overextend yourself. ``Look at yourself in the mirror every
morning and repeat, `I can't do everything,' '' advises Messinger.
   Messinger also told the candidates that before getting started,
they should go out and shake hands with some strangers.
   ``If you can't do that, you shouldn't run,'' she said.

   Cuba has informed U.S. diplomats that it is
lowering from 55 to 45 the minimum age for Cuban men to visit
relatives in the United States. The requirement for women was
reduced from 50 to 40 years, officials said Tuesday.
   U.S. officials said the Cuban move to increase traffic between
the two countries may have been prompted by Cuba's desire to
increase hard currency holdings. Alternatively, the officials said,
Cuba may be hoping that large numbers of those who leave will never
return to the island, thereby easing housing and other shortages.
   ``We could be faced with a legal Mariel,'' said one official,
referring to the boat lift 10 years ago that brought an estimated
125,000 Cubans without documents to Florida.
   The official added that U.S. consular officials will have to
issue visas on the basis of whether they believe applicants are
going to remain in the United States.
   ``If we think he's an intending immigrant, we wouldn't issue a
visa,'' the official said.
   There was no immediate comment from Cuba's diplomatic mission
here.
   The U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said the
liberalized travel rules most likely have an economic motivation
because of the steady decline in the Cuban economy.
   Reductions in the delivery of oil and other goods by the Soviet
Union to Cuba has forced the government to take draconian austerity
measures. Cuba's ability to import has been severely restricted by
low levels of hard currency holdings.
   Regular air service between the United States and Cuba was
suspended three decades ago but there are three L-1011
``humanitarian'' flights a week between Havana and Miami, each
carrying a maximum of 316 passengers. They permit elderly Cubans to
visit their U.S. relatives and also allow Cuban-Americans to visit
family members on the island.
   In the latter category, Cuba has increased the number
Cuban-Americans permitted to travel to Cuba each year from 2,500 to
5,000, the officials said.
   Cubans visiting the United States are permitted by their
government to return with a maximum of $500. They are required to
exchange their dollars for pesos at the official rate.
   Immigration has been a sore point in U.S.-Cuban relations for
years. Under a 1987 agreement between the two countries, Cuba
claimed the United States committed itself to accept 20,000
emigrants a year from Cuba.
   U.S. officials denied that any such commitment was made,
pointing out that immigration levels are based on whether a
would-be emigrant has close relatives in the United States who are
U.S. citizens.
   Many Cuban immigrants have never become U.S. citizens, thereby
reducing the number of Cubans still on the island who would qualify
for permission to emigrate. U.S. officials said about 3,500 Cubans
have been emigrating annually to the United States. Former
political prisoners are treated as a separate category. An average
of 3,000 have been admitted annually as refugees.

<HEAD>Woman Misses TV Broadcast Announcing She Won $2 Million</HEAD>

   NBC broadcast the winning number to
the nation, but Tanya Jackson didn't learn until the next day she
had won $2 million - she doesn't have a television set, at least
not yet.
   She won the prize through the ``McMillions on NBC'' contest.
Players pick up numbered game cards at McDonald's restaurants and
the winning numbers are announced during prime time each night on
NBC.
   Ms. Jackson's number was announced Sunday night on a break
during NBC's ``Hull High'' program.
   She found out she was a winner when her father, Burbert, drove
her to a McDonald's the next day to check.
   ``He said the number, and I started screaming that I'd won the
money,'' the 22-year-old eastern Indiana woman said.
   ``I said, `Let me recheck the ticket.' But she was right,'' her
father said. ``She sure had a ball going home.''
   The woman plans to use the money to pay off medical bills for
herself and her mother. She recently broke her ankle, and her
mother suffers from a bone ailment.
   She's luckier than Thelma and Charles Bellows, of Kawkawlin,
Mich. They had the winning number for a $10 million prize in the
contest last week and starting making plans for a new house and
furniture and a trip to the Caribbean.
   They even started work on a McDonald's commercial.
   Then McDonald's executives learned that their daughter,
Charlene, works at a McDonald's in Auburn, Mich., and the Bellows
were automatically disqualified.

   A county judge is taking his court to
the people.
   Berkeley County Circuit Judge Patrick Henry III is asking
residents to help him decide how to sentence former city dispatcher
Kimberly Gaither, who pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $6,000
from the city.
   Henry ordered Gaither on Monday to spend 60 days at the
Pruntytown Correctional Center while he gets opinions from ``the
little man on the street.'' The judge said Tuesday he would accept
written comments to the court or to the probation officer.
   Henry said deciding a sentence for Gaither is difficult because
she was once married to a state trooper and is now married to a
city police detective. Henry said he doesn't think Gaither will be
a repeat offender, but he thinks she should serve some time because
she violated the public's trust.
   Gaither pleaded guilty in July to two counts of embezzlement of
funds and falsifying city records from 1985 to 1989 while a
dispatcher. She is scheduled to report to prison Friday.

<HEAD>Israel Rejects Hurd's Appeals For Compromise On U.N. Inquiry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defiant Israel on Tuesday rejected appeals by
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd to find a way to cooperate
with a U.N. inquiry into the Temple Mount killings.
   However, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said he was willing to
meet with a U.N. fact-finding team if it comes to Israel to look
into the fatal police shootings of at least 19 Palestinians on Oct.
8.
   ``I think that I am secure (enough) in our intentions and with
the situation in Jerusalem, that whoever comes here I can receive
them and answer them,'' Kollek told Israel radio. ``Not to do this
doesn't portray strength. It portrays weakness.''
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Shamir was cool to Kollek's idea. ``A mission that comes to Israel
should see the government and not mayors,'' he said.
   Hurd met separately Tuesday with Shamir and Foreign Minister
David Levy, urging them to find a way to compromise on the U.N.
inquiry.
   Pazner said Shamir refused. He quoted the prime minister as
saying: ``This resolution deals with the question of Jerusalem,
which is our capital, and we don't see any reason for the United
Nations to investigate here.''
   Government officials said Hurd, in his meeting with Levy,
suggested that Israel separate the U.N. Security Council
condemnation of the Temple Mount shootings from the call for an
investigation.
   The British foreign secretary said Israel could reject the
criticism but agree to see a U.N. fact-finding team, according to
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hurd, who plans to meet with Palestinian leaders on Wednesday,
refused to tell reporters about his meetings with Shamir and Levy.
   Levy told reporters that the U.N. resolution on the inquiry
places ``demands that Israel cannot accept under any
circumstances.''
   He added: ``The basis of this (U.N.) delegation was a serious
indictment against Israel before the facts were checked.''
   Israel has been under increasing pressure to accept the U.N.
inquiry into the shootings at the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as
Haram al-Sharif. More than 140 Palestinians were wounded in
addition to the deaths.
   President Bush made it clear Monday that he wants Israel to
cooperate with the United Nations. ``We want to see that U.N.
resolution fully implemented,'' Bush said.
   The Israeli Cabinet decision Sunday to reject the U.N.
resolution came despite an appeal by U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. Baker said that rejecting the inquiry would detract
from international efforts to solve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar says he has not
yet decided if he will send a fact-finding team to Israel.
   Several Israeli newspapers published editorials Tuesday urging
the government to allow the U.N. investigatation.
   The daily Yedioth Ahronoth noted that the government allowed a
visit by Hurd, although ``he and his people were the architects of
the Security Council resolution against us.''
   Levy said the unanimous Security Council decision ignored the
fact that police fired on the Temple Mount because Palestinians had
stoned Jews worshiping at the nearby Western Wall, Judaism's
holiest site.
   Palestinians have maintained that the stoning was provoked by
rumors that an extremist Jewish group was marching on the Temple
Mount mosques to symbolize Israeli control.
   Israel has rejected any move that would call into question its
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, including the Arab eastern
sector captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The annexation has not been accepted by the United Nations or by
most Western countries, including the United States.
   Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, told a news conference here he was
assured by Shamir that Israel's own investigation of the killings
would be completed next week.
   ``It very well may be this report may be made available to the
United Nations ... and hopefully it can be utilized by the United
Nations and may satisfy the needs of the Security Council,'' Reich
said.
   The government has appointed a three-man independent panel to
investigate the shootings.

<HEAD>US Increases Rewards For Information on Terrorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States raised the ante in the war
against terrorism Tuesday, announcing that rewards up to a possible
$4 million will now be paid to obtain information on major
terrorist operations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who announced the
increase, also launched a radio and television campaign featuring
actors Charlton Heston, Charlie Sheen and Charles Bronson
encouraging the public to help develop information leading to the
arrest or conviction of terrorists.
   Under the new program, the $2 million in reward money previously
provided by the federal government will be bolstered by donations
of $1 million each from the Air Transport Association, representing
the U.S. airline industry, and the Airline Pilots Association,
representing 42,000 commercial pilots.
   The $2 million contributed by the airlines and pilots is
earmarked for rewards for information involving terrorist attacks
on U.S. civil aviation.
   The expanded rewards campaign comes amid increasing concerns
that Iraq may launch or inspire terrorist attacks against Western
targets in retaliation against the United Nations economic blockade
ordered after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Obviously we are quite concerned about the threats that have
emanated from Baghdad,'' Baker said. ``We will be very alert ... to
the possibility that there will be an expansion of terrorism
worldwide.''
   Such acts as the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, and last week's assassination of the speaker
of the Egyptian parliament, Baker said, ``are meant to seize us
with horror, to bring daily life to a standstill, to hold entire
nations hostage.''
   ``Even as we recoil in horror at the carnage, there are ways
that governments and citizens can work together to ensure that the
warped psychology of the terrorist does not dominate our lives or
distort our policies,'' Baker said.
   ``Every government and every citizen has a stake in bringing
terrorists to justice,'' he said, adding that the rewards program
can play a key role.
   Baker disclosed that $500,000 in rewards were paid out last year
for information about terrorists and their operations.
   He declined to give details, saying they are classified to
protect the informants.
   ``We can also relocate people who provide helpful information,
and that's been done,'' he said.
   The television and radio commercials have been produced in six
languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Arabic and Greek. Each
encourages the sending of information concerning terrorism and asks
the question: ``Are you the next hero?''
   State Department officials said they are negotiating with U.S.
radio and television networks to broadcast the commercials free of
charge, and that at least one television network thus far has shown
interest. They did not identify the network. The officials said the
U.S. Information Agency and U.S. diplomatic missions overseas would
make efforts to have the spots shown in other countries.
   Persons not wishing to approach a U.S. Embassy or consulate are
urged to write ``HEROES, Box 96781, Washington, D.C., 20090-6781.''

   Three Americans who gave investors,
stockholders and corporate directors a better understanding of the
intricate financial markets won the Nobel memorial prize in
economics Tuesday.
   Harry F. Markowitz of the City University of New York, Merton
Miller of the University of Chicago and William Sharpe of Stanford
University will share the prize, worth about $700,000.
   Since the prize in economics was first awarded by the Swedish
Academy of Sciences in 1969, 18 of the 30 winners have been
Americans.
   ``There has been a very powerful and rich development of finance
economy as a scientific subject, and that was a main reason for
giving them the prize,'' said academy committee member Bengt
Naslund.
   The academy said financial markets serve a key purpose in a
modern market economy by allocating resources to various production
areas.
   ``It's important that these markets function efficiently. That,
they can really only do if we have a proper understanding of
them,'' Naslund said.
   Therefore, he said, Markowitz, Sharpe and Miller made ``an
essential contribution which concerns us all.''
   Miller, 67, said he thought it was a crank call when committee
chairman Assar Lindbeck called him early Tuesday with the news.
   ``I picked up the phone, and you don't hear anything ... and
suddenly I hear a voice with a Swedish accent, and my heart stopped
a bit,'' he said.
   Lindbeck said Miller and Sharpe were ``really stunned'' by the
news but recovered enough to ask about the exchange rate for
kronor.
   The academy deayed announcing the prize for about 45 minutes
while trying to reach Markowitz in Japan, where he begins teaching
a course Wednesday at Tokyo University. But reporters found him
first.
   ``I'd thought it was never going to happen,'' the 63-year-old
Markowitz said.
   Markowitz developed a theory in the 1950s explaining how
households and companies choose shares and reduce the risks
involved, the so-called theory of portfolio choice.
   ``His theory analyzes how wealth can be optimally invested in
assets which differ in regard to their expected return and risk,
and thereby also how risks can be reduced,'' the academy said.
   Markowitz published his pioneer works in 1952 and 1959. Sharpe
and Miller drew on his theories.
   ``My work follows Harry Markowitz,'' said Sharpe, reached in
Arizona. ``He was my mentor. ... I owe him a huge debt.''
   Sharpe, 56, developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model in the
1960s. It is considered the backbone of modern price theory for
financial markets.
   The model helps in calculating capital costs associated with
investments and takeovers, regulating public utilities and deciding
court cases involving expropriated firms whose shares are not
listed on stock exchanges. It is also used in empirical analysis to
arrange statistical data systematically and efficiently.
   Miller showed what factors determine a company's choices in
accruing debt and distributing assets.
   ``He underscored the important relationship between a company
and that same capital market which the other two prize-winners
analyzed,'' Naslund said.
   Miller's theory is based on the assumption that stockholders
have access to the same capital market as firms. As a result,
corporate managers saw that the best way to safeguard the interests
of stockholders was to maximize the firm's net wealth.
   Miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prize-winner
Franco Modigliani of the United States.
   ``Our work was known as the Modigliani-Miller propositions of
corporate finance,'' Miller said. ``He then won it (the prize) for
his contributions with me, but also for his other work in
economics.''
   The economics prize was instituted in 1968 by Sweden's Central
Bank to complement the five prizes established in the will of
dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel. Nobel's original prizes in physics,
chemistry, medicine, peace and literature have been awarded since
1901.
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was awarded the peace
prize on Monday. Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the
prize in literature, and Americans Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall
Thomas won the prize in medicine.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death in 1896.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private research group asked the Internal
Revenue Service on Tuesday to investigate the tax-exempt status of
the National Merit Scholarship Corp., contending it discriminates
against women and minorities.
   The National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing, known as FairTest,
said only those students who are the highest scorers on the
Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test-National Merit Scholarship
Qualifying Test are eligible to compete for the ``prestigious and
financially-valuable awards.''
   And it said those tests are biased against ``non-white and
female students.''
   National Merit officials said they were unaware of the letter
and did not immediately respond further. Internal Revenue Service
officials said the matter was confidential and refused to comment.
   In a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr., FairTest
officials said, ``The Internal Revenue Service has previously
determined that institutions which fail to follow racially
nondiscriminatory policies are not to be considered 'charitable.'
This policy requires, among other things, that schools not
discriminate on the basis of race in their scholarship programs.''
   National Merit's ``exclusive reliance on scores from a biased
exam ... violates this fundamental policy of nondiscrimination.
Therefore, (National Merit) should not be subsidized by federal
money through tax exemption,'' said the letter.
   FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass., research organization, estimated
that minority students, who make up a quarter of high school
graduates, receive a much smaller proportion of the National Merit
Awards. National Merit declines to make public an ethnic breakdown
of scholarship winners.
   FairTest said it also has found that nearly two-thirds of the
semifinalists are boys.
   ``Thus rather than selecting from among the brightest and best
college-bound students, (the program) picks finalists from a pool
of outstanding test-takers by eliminating 99.5 percent of all
applicants solely on the basis of their score on a discriminatory
test,'' the organization's letter said.
   ``Talented women and minorities, many at the top of their class,
are thereby eliminated from the competition by a single test score,
which even the test-makers say should never be used in isolation,''
said the letter.
   If the scholarship process were fair, young women, who receive
better grades than young men in both high school and college and
make up 54 percent of the qualifying test takers, would earn at
least that proportion of the awards, or $4.4 million more than they
currently receive, said the letter.
   It was signed by FairTest Executive Director Cinthia Schuman and
by Sarah Stockwell, the organization's university testing
coordinator.

<HEAD>State And Local Tax Revenues Up 7.5 Percent in Fiscal 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   State and local governments increased their
tax revenues by 7.5 percent each in the 1989 fiscal year,
collecting $469 billion, the Census Bureau reported on Tuesday.
Property taxes were the largest source.
   State and local governments reported total revenues, including
taxes, of $953 billion, up 7.8 percent over 1988 when they were
$885 billion. The 1989 revenues included $161 billion for a variety
of services, $126 billion from the federal government and $111
billion from insurance trusts.
   Their spending in the 1989 fiscal year totaled $891 billion, a
7.8 percent increase, including $263 billion for education, $95
billion for public welfare and $71 billion for government-operated
utilities.
   States collected $284 billion and local governments $185 billion
in taxes, the Census Bureau said in a preliminary report. The total
in 1988 was $436 billion. The increase for 1989 was lower than the
average for the previous five years when local taxes went up an
average of 8.4 percent a year and state taxes 7.6 percent.
   The bureau released some of the state figures in August and they
showed that eight states had increases of more than 10 percent,
including 22.5 percent for Oregon and 14.2 percent for California.
Only Utah and South Dakota reported decreases in state tax
collections.
   State fiscal years do not always end on Sept. 30, as does the
federal government's, but Henry Wulf of the Census Bureau said that
the figures for each state cover a single year, no matter when that
ends.
   The new report included local government tax revenues and showed
that property taxes produced $143 billion, or 30 percent of the
total. All but $5.4 billion of that went to local governments.
   General sales taxes produced $113 billion and individual income
taxes $98 billion. Together with property taxes, these provided
nearly three of every four tax dollars collected by state and local
governments.
   General sales taxes of $93 billion and individual income taxes
of $89 billion provided nearly two-thirds of state revenues.
   Local property taxes rose 7.8 percent over 1988, slightly below
the average annual increase since 1984 of 8.2 percent.
   Debts for state and local governments were $798 billion, up from
$755 billion in 1988. About two-thirds, or $503 billion, was owed
by local governments.

<TEXT>
   A dispute over three cases of leftover
wine at a wedding reception erupted into a brawl, which ended with
the arrest of the bride's father and of members of the wedding
party.
   Michael Calise, whose daughter was married Sunday, had paid for
the wine and wanted to take it home when the reception ended. But
Rolando Trovini, owner of the reception hall, said state liquor law
prohibits removing liquor from the hall.
   That's when the fighting started.
   ``We ended up being assaulted,'' Calise said. ``Physically and
psychologically battered. They descended on us so quickly - it was
the most astounding thing that's ever happened to me.''
   Trovini called police, who arrested Calise, 50, on charges of
interfering with police, breach of peace and refusing to be
fingerprinted. His daughter, Maria, 27, a bridesmaid, and his son,
Frank, 23, also were arrested for interfering with police.
   Two other people also were arrested.
   ``One can't imagine what it's like to have a wonderful wedding,
marry off a daughter, expend large sums of money and have something
this astounding happen,'' Calise said.
   Trovini, owner of Sante's Manor, told police the wedding party
caused $6,000 worth of damage.
   ``They pay for six hours of wedding - it doesn't mean they can
take the place with them,'' he said. ``There was a lot of chaos
here.''
   Calise said he had purchased the wine himself from a winery
rather than use the wine supplied by Sante's.
   However, state liquor law prohibits removing alcohol from an
establishment, even if it is brought by a group renting a hall,
said Jerry Langlais, a spokesman for the state Department of Liquor
Control.
   The bride, Sandra Calise, and the groom, Carmine Cenatiempo,
left for their honeymoon Monday - a day late.

<HEAD>Survey Says More Americans Contributing To Charity, Volunteering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Led by baby boomers, Americans are giving more
time and money to charitable causes, a Gallup Poll said Tuesday.
   The average household contributed $734, or 2 percent of income,
in 1989, an increase of 20 percent after inflation compared to
1987, the survey said.
   Over the same period, the number of adults doing volunteer work
grew 23 percent, from 80 million to 93.4 million.
   ``If these encouraging trends continue, we truly can predict a
renaissance of philanthropy in America,'' said Virginia A.
Hodgkinson, vice president of Independent Sector, which
commissioned the survey.
   About 65 percent of donations, an average of $477, went to
religious organizations or causes. Among others, $60 went to human
services, $56 to education, $46 to health, $28 to youth development
and $19 to arts, culture and humanities.
   Nine percent of families donated 5 percent or more of their
household income,, the poll said.
   Gallup questioned 2,727 adults over the age of 18 from March to
May this year. It carried out a similar poll in 1988 covering 1987
charitable activities.
   The results indicated that 71 million households, or 75 percent
of the total, contributed to charity in 1989, up from 65 million,
or 71 percent, in 1987.
   Among respondents aged 35 to 44, 86 percent of households gave
to charity, up from 77 percent in 1987. People doing volunteer work
grew from 45 percent to 62 percent in the 25-34 age group and from
54 percent to 64 percent in the 35-44 age group.
   ``The dramatic increases in donating time and money among the
baby boom generation is good news for today and may suggest even
better news for the future as this very large population group
assumes community responsibility,'' said Independent Sector
President Brian O'Connell.
   Independent Sector is a coalition of corporate and voluntary
organizations that promote volunteerism and not-for-profit
initiatives.
   The survey found that 61 percent of black families contributed
to charities, up from 51 percent in 1987, and that the percentage
of black volunteers rose from 28 percent to 38 percent.
   The average American adult did 2.2 hours of volunteer work a
week, the poll said. The largest group of volunteers, 17.7 percent,
helped religious organizations, followed by 10.1 percent in
education and 9.7 percent in youth development.
   Fifty-eight percent of families who don't attend religious
services contributed to charity, compared to 88 percent for
families who go to services weekly.
   The survey also found that lower-income families are
comparatively more generous than the rich.
   Contributing families with incomes under $10,000 annually gave
5.5 percent of their incomes, while the rate was 1.7 percent for
those in the $50,000-$60,000 income bracket and 2.9 percent for
those making $75,000 to $100,000.
   ``In comparison to lower-income families and, in contrast to
their disposable income, most wealthy Americans have to be
characterized as stingy,'' O'Connell said.
   The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

   Sometimes, it's a dog-eat-car world for
appraisers in Tulsa County.
   Appraiser Bob Bryant said his 1979 Toyota received $166 in
damage when two pit bulls chewed through the rubber portion of his
front bumper and gnawed at the paint Oct. 4 after he had appraised
property in north Tulsa.
   Bryant said he petted the pit bulls - two adults and two pups -
before he got into his car.
   ``As I drove from the property, the two adult dogs ran along
beside and in front of my car,'' Bryant said. ``I knew they were
biting at my tires because I could feel them bumping the side of my
car.''
   He said the dogs gave up the chase after a quarter-mile.
   Wayne Carr, county finance director, said the dogs' owner has
been sent a letter seeking repayment. Carr said the dogs should
have been tied up.
   It was not the first time a dog has attacked an appraiser's car.
   ``A few years ago, a Doberman bit a hole in a Honda's tire,''
Carr said.

<HEAD>France, Lebanon Try to Ease Quarrel; Dismantling of Green Line
Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army bulldozers removed more mines along
the capital's dividing Green Line Tuesday, and France sought to
ease an escalating quarrel with Lebanon over the fate of Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   President Elias Hrawi pledged to reunify the nation and end its
15-year civil war. He said he would work from the bombed-out
presidential palace, where Aoun had his headquarters, even if he
has to put up a tent.
   Aoun spent a fourth day in the French Embassy in east Beirut,
where he fled Saturday after being defeated in an eight-hour
Syrian-led blitz. The assault, which left 160 people dead, ended
the Christian general's 11-month mutiny.
   France promptly granted Aoun asylum. But the Lebanese government
refuses to allow him to leave the country and wants to try him on a
variety of charges, including the theft of state funds.
   On Tuesday, the government set up a military checkpoint near the
embassy, but said the measure was designed to prevent anti-Aoun
demonstrators from storming the building.
   ``France and Lebanon do not intend to permit a crisis to develop
between them,'' French Ambassador Rene Ala told reporters after
meeting Hrawi in Moslem west Beirut. It was his third meeting with
the Lebanese president in 24 hours.
   Reporters on the scene said soldiers at the checkpoint made no
move to stop people from getting into or out of the embassy or
block traffic in the vicinity.
   Aoun began his mutiny in November 1989 after rejecting an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's civil war, which has
killed an estimated 150,000 people. He called Hrawi, like himself a
Maronite Catholic, a ``Syrian puppet'' and refused to recognize his
government.
   The peace plan provides for the traditionally dominant
Christians to share power with the Moslem majority. Aoun rejected
the plan because there was no timetable for the withdrawal of
Syrian troops.
   Bulldozers, meanwhile, continued to remove mines along the Green
Line Tuesday, a day after authorities opened a key intersection to
traffic.
   Several Lebanese compared the dismantling of the Green Line - a
series of earth mounds that have split Beirut into Moslem and
Christian sections since 1975 - to the removal of the Berlin Wall.
   ``There's a ray of hope now,'' Moslem housewife Jinan Sukkar
said.
   ``Berlin has been united and has gotten rid of the wall that had
divided it for many years,'' Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul
was quoted as saying. ``Now it's Beirut being united with the Green
Line ceasing to exist.''
   Hrawi told a delegation representing the Christian population in
Aoun's former enclave that ``very soon I'll be in the palace. I
won't wait for reconstruction works. I'll erect a tent there and
receive people.''
   He said that ``hostile acts'' by some pro-Syrian leftist
militias that infiltrated into Aoun's former territory after his
forces collapsed ``would be eliminated soon.''
   ``I'll re-unify the nation,'' Hrawi pledged.
   In parts of Christian east Beirut and in Aoun's former
stronghold, people spoke of alleged looting by the Syrians and
their militia allies. Motorists were taking detours to avoid Syrian
checkpoints in streets where posters of Aoun had been replaced by
those of President Hafez Assad of Syria.
   As Hrawi spoke Tuesday, Syrian-backed Christian militiamen led
by Elie Hobeika were seen patrolling the streets of suburban
Hadath, southeast of Beirut, checking identity cards and searching
houses along with Syrian soldiers for Aoun loyalists.
   ``Last night Hobeika's men searched the house for my two
brothers, who were soldiers serving under Aoun,'' said a native of
Hadath, who identified herself only as Georgette.
   ``I told them that I haven't seen them since the attack on
Saturday. They didn't beat me or anything, they only searched the
house and left,'' Georgette said.
   ``I wonder why didn't Aoun surrender to Hrawi's army. It would
have been much better than having the Syrians and their allies
humiliating us,'' she said.
   Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate, considers the country its strategic backyard.
The fall of Aoun has strengthened its hold on the country.
   Also Tuesday, Parliament re-elected Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, as speaker for a four-year term.

<HEAD>Study: Survival Up, Despite Medicare's Hospital Payment Limips</HEAD>

   Contrary to many doctors' fears, the survival of
elderly hospitalized patients improved during the 1980s under the
government's system of limiting Medicare payments, a study says.
   But the rate at which Medicare patients were sent home in
unstable conditions - such as with rapid heartbeats or confusion -
jumped from about 10 percent to about 15 percent, said the study of
more than 14,000 patients.
   Unstable patients had a greater likelihood of dying. The chance
was about 16 percent within 90 days, compared with about a 10
percent chance for patients discharged in stable condition, the
study reported.
   ``The good news is that over time, there's better care delivered
by doctors and nurses during hospitalization, and the new payment
system didn't interrupt that,'' said Dr. Katherine L. Kahn, who
headed the study for the RAND Corp., a non-profit research group
based in Santa Monica, Calif.
   ``However, associated with the introduction of the new payment
system, and probably caused by it, there was an increase in
patients discharged with instability,'' which ``somewhat reduced
the gains in survival overall,'' she said.
   The findings were published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The government footed the entire $3.9 million cost of the study
of Medicare's so-called ``prospective pricing system,'' introduced
as a cost-saving strategy in 1983.
   Under prospective pricing, the government limits payment for
hospitalization of Medicare patients to a flat rate per admission
calculated for each of 470 groups of illnesses. Before prospective
pricing, the government paid whatever costs Medicare patients ran
up while hospitalized.
   The new system has slowed the upward spiral of the cost of
Medicare, which covers Americans over age 65. But it has raised
fears that care would be compromised through shortened hospital
stays and the substitution of cheaper services and procedures.
   A 19-member RAND research team compared 1981-82 patient records
- before prospective pricing - to 1985-86 records - after
prospective pricing - at 297 hospitals.
   The researchers found discharges were quicker - the mean length
of stay dropped from 14.4 days to 11.0 days, a difference of 3.4
days.
   But the death rate overall also dropped, from 16.5 percent to
15.4 percent, in the 30 days after hospital discharge for patients
with any of the five conditions studied. They were congestive heart
failure, heart attack, pneumonia, stroke or hip fracture.
   Under the new pricing system, there also was a slight decline in
the number of patients dead by 180 days, but the figure would have
declined even further had it not been for deaths due to instability
and other problems at discharge, researchers said.
   The researchers also reported that the proportion of patients
receiving poor or very poor care declined from 25 percent to 12
percent but ``remained a worrisome issue.''
   The study is the most comprehensive yet evaluating the impact of
prospective pricing on the quality of care, other researchers said.
   But Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund of
New York and a member of the Prospective Payment Assessment
Commission, a congressional agency that evaluates Medicare pricing,
said he was ``not terribly surprised'' at the findings.
   ``Other, less sophisticated efforts to try to measure the
quality effects of the system have produced similar results,''
Vladeck said in a telephone interview. He added that the findings
were nonetheless ``reassuring.''
   Charles Dougherty, director of the Center for HePolicy and
Ethics at Creighton University, said that even though ``there is
some real good news here,'' the increase in discharges of patients
in unstable medical condition is disturbing.
   ``People are leaving hospitals who in years previously ... would
have warranted admission to a hospital,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Omaha, Neb.

<HEAD>Thai Leader Leaves on European Trip Despite Domestic Troubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister has left on a
European trip despite growing pressures on his government,
including a student's attempt at self-immolation to protest
official corruption.
   Some said the suicide attempt was instigated by pro-military
groups.
   The army's supreme commander, Gen. Sunthorn Khongsomphong, said
in a television interview Monday that the situation in Thailand is
``very fragile.''
   He said the military will ``try to prevent the situation from
becoming violent and from affecting the people's normal way of
life.''
   Premier Chatichai Choonhavan left late Monday for official
visits to Britain and Switzerland, where he hoped to encourage
private business investment in Thailand.
   He has said that upon his return Oct. 23, he would reshuffle the
Cabinet, which has been plagued by infighting, widespread charges
of corruption and declining support from the army.
   Army commander Sunthorn denied any military involvement in the
suicide attempt Sunday by Tanawot Klingchue, a 21-year-old student
at Ramkhamhaeng University.
   Tanawot poured gasoline over his head and set himself on fire
just outside the campus after accusing the government of corruption
and demanding its resignation.
   Later Sunday, police stopped a small group of other students who
threatened to set themselves on fire in front of the prime
minister's offices if the government did not resign.
   Tanawot's act shocked the public. Self-immolation as a form of
protest has been unheard of in Thailand in recent years.
   Tanawot remained in critical condition Tuesday with burns
covering 90 percent of his body. His chances of survival were slim,
said the acting commander at the hospital, police Maj. Gen. Pisoot
Pintuyotin.
   The Students Federation of Thailand, the main student umbrella
group, has also demanded that the government resign but has
denounced the suicide attempt, saying it did not represent the
student movement.
   The Ramkhamhaeng University Students Union said the student
protesters belonged to a group infiltrated by the little-known
Revolutionary Council, apparently a pro-military group.
   The Thai newspaper The Nation quoted unidentified government
sources Tuesday as saying police were seeking to question two
leaders of the council suspected of being behind the suicide
attempt.

<HEAD>Israelis And Palestinians: Not Much Pity For The Others' Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hearts have hardened in the violent struggle
over the holy land, and neither Palestinians nor Israelis show much
pity for the others' victims.
   After 19 Palestinians were shot dead by police on the sacred
Temple Mount last week, an Israeli worker in a fast-food restaurant
told a customer: ``I wish a hundred had been killed.''
   After the same incident, a 58-year-old Palestinian said: ``I
wish Hitler was alive, so he can finish the job and make them all
into soap.''
   And he is what many Israelis would call a ``good Arab,'' having
worked for the Israeli government for 18 years and learned fluent
Hebrew.
   These are spur-of-the-moment remarks, but they are indicative of
the harsh atmosphere of daily life in Jerusalem.
   Psychologists say the comments are the result of a decades-old
ethnic conflict that has intensified since the December 1987 start
of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
   ``In situations of prolonged conflict, the gap between the
adversary communities keeps growing, and each side dehumanizes the
other,'' said Ariel Merari, an expert on political violence at Tel
Aviv University.
   Signs of such dehumanization abound. Israelis have been known to
refer to Palestinians as ``dogs'' or ``cockroaches.'' Palestinians
have termed Israelis ``animals'' or ``Nazis.''
   In the early years of the Israeli occupation, an arm's-length
coexistence developed as Arabs flocked into Israel looking for
jobs, and Israelis poured into the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
picnic and sightsee.
   But today, Palestinians see Israelis as the soldiers who open
fire on teen-age stone-throwers and stop Palestinian drivers at
roadblocks, or as indifferent military bureaucrats.
   Most Israelis see Palestinians only as the terrorists planting
bombs on Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda Mall or as faceless figures
sweeping the streets of Tel Aviv.
   Until now, the main expression of Palestinian hatred has been
stones and fire-bombs. But after the bloodbath on the Temple Mount,
the pro-PLO leaders of the uprising threatened to escalate the
conflict.
   ``This stage requires the use of weapons, arson, stabbings and
destroying anything we can reach,'' their leaflet said.
   If compassion is lacking, excuses are not.
   The Temple Mount clash began with Arabs throwing rocks down on
Jewish worshipers at theWWestern Wall, also known as the Wailing
Wall, injuring 28 people, most of them slightly. To Israelis, it
was a desecration so outrageous that whatever happened afterward
seemed almost secondary.
   Police opened fire in response to the stoning.
   In July 1989, when an Arab grabbed the wheel of an Israeli bus
and plunged it into a ravine, killing 17 people, Palestinians
excused him by saying he was avenging the beatings of his family
and friends by soldiers.
   Political leaders on both sides use history to justify their
actions.
   Palestinians bring up Deir Yassin, the village near Jerusalem
where Jewish militiamen massacred more than 250 people in 1948.
Israelis cite Palestinian guerrilla attacks in which hundreds of
Israeli civilians have been killed.
   Both sides often refuse to acknowledge each others' suffering.
   Many Palestinians belittle the Holocaust, the memory of which
helps shape the prickly, uncompromising Israeli character. Israelis
show little awareness of the constant humiliation and harassment
Palestinians are subjected to under occupation.
   There are, however, many exceptions.
   Israeli peace activists brave the mockery and threats of
violence by the militant right to demonstrate their sympathy for
the Palestinians. Moderate Palestinians risk the wrath of
hard-liners by trying to find common ground with Israelis.
   Dr. Michael Stark, a Jerusalem obstetrician, felt compelled to
tell a patient's Palestinian husband how terrible he felt about the
Temple Mount killings.
   ``I'm not justifying the people who threw stones, but I believe
that the police response was out of all proportion. And I'm ashamed
that this happened,'' Stark said.
   Said Kenaan, a pro-PLO businessman from the West Bank city of
Nablus, said he and other moderates tried unsuccessfully to
dissuade militants from calling for the killing of Israeli soldiers
and Jewish settlers.
   Kenaan said he is undeterred. ``Some of us still believe it's
best to stick to non-violence,'' he said.

   Mayor Bill Boner won little sympathy in
his hometown when he and aspiring country singer Traci Peel
discussed their romance before a national television audience on
the ``Donahue'' talk show.
   ``I'm thoroughly disgusted with the way the mayor and his wife
handled themselves,'' R.J. Hill, an engineering consultant, said
after watching the syndicated show Monday. ``Boner and Peel should
have defended themselves before the people of Nashville rather than
to a national audience.''
   The relationship between Boner, 45, and Peel, 34, made national
headlines this summer while Boner was living with his third wife,
Betty. Boner married Peel on Oct. 1, three days after the divorce
was final.
   ``You are very close to giving the finger to the city,'' TV host
Phil Donahue said during the taping of the show Thursday in New
York. ``You're a distracted mayor. You were an out-of-the-closet
adulterer.''
   Boner said he has accomplished much during his three-year term.
   ``I've brought moremoney into Nashville than anybody else,''
Boner said. ``We lived up to our commitments. We have a totally
integrated solid-waste management system.''
   Peel told Donahue that her comment published in the Nashville
Banner that Peel's passion could last for seven hours at a time was
made in jest in a conversation she thought was off the record. The
Banner has published statements that it stands by its story.
   At one point, Peel sang ``Rocky Top,'' accompanied by Boner on
the harmonica.
   Students in Tommy Henley's sociology class at Maplewood High
School were left with disdain.
   ``This is embarrassing,'' Tometrias Mullins said. ``They already
think we're hicks.''
   ``They should leave his personal life alone and get on the main
issues like the landfill and education,'' said student Raymond
Broughton.
   Phone calls poured into the Nashville Scene, a weekly newspaper
edited by Bruce Dobie, who appeared on the talk show with Boner and
Peel and WLAC-AM talk show host Les Jameson.
   ``They're saying we need to let this Boner thing rest. But
others are saying, `This guy's a disgrace.' They want to know how
we can recall him,'' Dobie said.
   The show resulted in a number of calls to the mayor's office,
said Boner spokesman Rick Runyeon.
   ``We have received a number of calls and there has been probably
an equal balance between positive and negative,'' Runyeon said.
``We've received a lot of calls from out of city and out of state
and those tend to be more positive than the local calls.''
   After taping ``Donahue!'' last week, Boner released a statement
declaring his personal life off-limits to reporters.

<HEAD>Officials Investigate Case Of Child Who Dialed Long Distance for
Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child welfare officials said Tuesday they
were investigating the case of a 4-year-old girl who was left alone
with a bad cold and got help by randomly dialing a Wisconsin health
department.
   ``This would be considered a child neglect case,'' said Patricia
Watters, division chief for the Montgomery County Department of
Child Welfare Services. ``Last year, we had about 500 cases of
neglect reported, and about 5 percent of those were unattended
children.''
   The girl, whose name was not released, began dialing random
telephone numbers to try to find her mother Monday morning. She
reached the Walworth County ``Public Health Line'' about 9:30 a.m.
EDT.
   ``I was kind of shaking at first,'' receptionist Sara Weeks, who
answered the phone, said Tuesday. ``We were really concerned at
first that she had been abandoned in her house.''
   During the 2{ hours the girl was on the phone, Ms. Weeks and
nurse Jane Hildeick alternated talking with her as authorities
traced the call.
   ``We picked up on her cues,'' Ms. Weeks said. ``When we wrote
down Washington, we screamed.''
   Ms. Weeks said she was on the phone when police arrived at the
apartment.
   ``I was on the phone when the officer came to the door and I
could hear him through the door,'' she added. Mother and daughter
were reunited a short time later at the police station in Silver
Spring, Md.
   Ms. Watters said the problem of unattended children is
increasing.
   ``One real problem we are dealing with is that people cannot
afford regular day care. We are seeing more of that,'' she said.
   She added that Maryland law says no child under the age of 8 can
be left alone or confined unless there is a reliable person at
least 13 years of age left in charge.
   She said she understood that the mother, identified by police as
27-year-old Luvisca Deligny, had gone to the bank to run an errand
and had left the child with her two roommates, who went to work.
   ``That's why we are conducting the investigation,'' Ms. Watters
said. ``We are trying to discover if this is a pattern or one
instance where someone who normally is supposed to be there
isn't.''
   Police charged the mother with leaving a child unattended, a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 and a 30-day jail
term.
   Ms. Deligny said she took the day off to care for her sick child
and had left to run an errand.
   ``I'm still not sure she was on the phone that long,'' she said.
``I'll wait to see the phone bill to determine if it's true.''
   Walworth County in Wisconsin is a farming area east of Madison
and about 60 miles north of Chicago.

   Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents
and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American
maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today
alongside his wife.
   Bernstein, who died of lung failure Sunday at age 72, was buried
this afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood Cemetery in
Brooklyn. His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
   Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic
performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first
American-born music director. Bernstein was appointed in 1958 and
stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
   The Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program beginning
Thursday and continuing through Oct. 23. The schedule had called
for works by Shostakovich and Beethoven.
   A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14,
the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
   Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composed
symphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such as
``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and ``Candide.''
   His Emmy-winning ``Young People's Concerts'' on television
introduced thousands to classical music.
   ``He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no
doubt about it,'' said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of ``West
Side Story,'' said Bernstein himself played the piano for him
during rehearsals.
   ``He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too
much,'' Kert said. ``I was the new kid on the block and he stroked
me and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that.''

<HEAD>Vegetable Harvest Down 15 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vegetable harvest is down about 15 percent
this year, more bad news for consumers already suffering from
shortages of meat, eggs, cheese and sugar, Soviet media reported
Tuesday.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda blamed the vegetable
shortfall on heavy rain, a manpower shortage and lack of
transportation.
   Consumer dissatisfaction has eroded public support for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms. He unveiled a new economic
plan on Tuesday.
   Under a headline asking ``What Will We Eat in Winter?,'' Pravda
said 9.8 million tons of vegetables had been collected across the
country as of Oct. 8, 1.5 million tons less than at this time last
year.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has voiced particular
concern about potatoes, a key winter food. As of Oct. 11, Moscow
had stockpiled only 13 percent of the potatoes the city is expected
to need to get through the winter.
   At this time last year, the capital's stockpiles of potatoes
were nearly six times larger than they are now, the newspaper
Moskovsky Komsomolets reported.
   Pravda carried short dispatches from its correspondents around
the country describing the harvest. In many areas, the problem is
not the quantity of vegetables growing in the fields, but lack of
manpower, fuel, transportation and storage facilities to get the
food to market, it said.
   In the Russian province of Stavropol, where Gorbachev spent his
childhood, less than half the vegetables had been picked by Oct. 1.
Plans called for 20,000 workers and 900 trucks to take part in the
harvest there, but only about one-quarter of those people and half
the trucks are working, Pravda said.
   In the Rostov region of southeastern Russia, there is a
tremendous shortage of trucks, and what few are available often run
out of gas, the newspaper quoted a regional official as saying.
   Similar problems plague the bumper Soviet grain harvest. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated the Soviet crop at 235
million metric tons, nearly a record. But experts estimate 20
percent to 30 percent will be lost because of poor transportation
and spoilage.
   There was no bread in Moscow stores for two weeks in September,
but it is now readily available. Shortages of other goods, such as
eggs and cheese, have worsened. Sugar is rationed, and people with
ration coupons have difficulty finding any.

<HEAD>Baker Rules Out `Partial Solution' to Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III declared
on Tuesday that ``a partial solution'' to the Persian Gulf crisis
short of total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is unacceptable to the
Bush administration.
   Referring to persistent hints of compromise from Baghdad, Baker
said President Saddam Hussein evidently was interested ``in a
negotiated arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from
his unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor.''
   Baker rejected that notion outright. ``It's a case. from our
standpoint, of not wanting to succumb to the siren song of a
partial solution to this crisis.''
   The hints emanated from Baghdad after the Aug. 2 invasion and
culminated Sunday with a report by a Soviet news agency that Saddam
might be prepared to pull out from most of Kuwait in exchange for
keeping several strategic islands in the Persian Gulf.
   The report followed a high-level visit to Iraq by Evgeny
Primakov, the leading Soviet expert on the Middle East and Persian
Gulf. Baker cautioned, however, that an overture may not have been
made to the Soviet official and that Moscow ``has remained as solid
as the United States on the issue of no partial solution.''
   Determined to tighten the economic screws on Iraq, Baker said
the U.N. Security Council should consider adopting resolutions
demanding Iraq pay reparations ``in the rape of Kuwait which is
still continuing'' and be held responsible for war crimes.
   Baker also said U.S. officials were ``quite concerned'' about
Iraqi threats to unleash terrorism against the West in retaliation
for the three-month economic blockade of the country.
   President Bush, campaigning in Des Moines for Iowa's Republican
Governor Terry Branstad, responded to a challenge by three youthful
protesters of U.S. policy in the Gulf by saying ``they've got it
all wrong.''
   Bush went on: ``What is happening is we see in Kuwait
unprecedented acts of brutality inflicted by Iraq. Iraqi aggression
will not be allowed to stand. Saddam Hussein will be held
accountable and the legitimate government of Kuwait will be
restored.''
   Baker took questions from reporters at a State Department
ceremony designed to heighten public interest in the U.S. campaign
against terrorism.
   On another subject, he urged Israel to reverse its decision
barring a U.N. mission to investigate a riot Oct. 8 on the hallowed
Temple Mount in which 19 Palestinian Arabs were shot to death by
Israeli police.
   ``It is only that way Israel will be able to make its case to
the Security Council,'' Baker said.
   In a gesture to the Israeli government, Baker condemned the
flinging of stones, bottles and other missives onto Jewish
worshipers at the Western Wall that preceded the shootings.
   ``We don't think there is any excuse for that, either,'' Baker
said.
   A senior Israeli diplomat said here Tuesday that it would be
naive to consider the U.N. investigators as fact-finders.
   ``What's the point of sending an investigator after you've made
the verdict already that Israel is to be condemned,'' Oded Eran,
the deputy Israeli ambassador, said referring to the Security
Council's unanimous adoption Friday night of a resolution
condemning Israel.
   He said the Bush administration made no attempt to work with
Israel to limit the impact of the resolution, which was drafted by
the United States with some help from Britain.
   He called the affair an example of ``the failure of the U.N. to
be evenhanded'' and explained that the decision taken Sunday by the
Israel Cabinet against a U.N. inquiry stemmed from ``the fear of
the introduction of the U.N. into the city of Jerusalem, which we
have tried to avoid at all cost.''
   Baker, in another dispute with Israel, implicitly criticized a
decision by an Israeli Cabinet committee to encourage an increase
in the settlement of Soviet Jews in East Jerusalem.
   He said the predominantly Arab sector of the city was beyond the
``Green Line'' that delineated Israel's boundaries before the 1967
Six Day War in which Jordan was stripped of East Jerusalem and the
West Bank.
   To pave the way for a $400 million U.S. housing loan guarantee,
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy assured Baker two weeks ago
that his government's policy was not to direct or settle Soviet
Jews beyond the Green Line.
   ``We think the United States is and should be entitled to rely
upon assurances received from the foreign minister of Israel,''
Baker said.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military has a partial
remedy for the sand and heat of the Saudi desert: drink water, and
lots of it.
   ``We kind of force them to drink it. They have no choice,''
Capt. Kelly Marunale, 30, of Woodstock, Ill., says of the
requirement that U.S. soldiers drink more than two gallons of water
each day.
   One of the first tasks of soldiers in the desert every morning
is to collect a box of six bottles of water - a day's supply. The
rule holds despite the easing in temperatures, down at least 15
degrees from the summer highs of 120 degrees.
   At the height of summer, there were reports that U.S. soldiers
in Saudi Arabia were required to drink six gallons of water a day.
   That made an impression on 10-year-old Hannah Bergstrem of
Loveland, Colo., who wrote to an officer saying: ``I wouldn't like
to be in Saudi Arabia drinking six gallons of water a day, but I
guess somebody has to do it.''
   Even the estimated two gallons each U.S. soldier is required to
drink daily looms large when the water must be trucked in for some
200,000 troops.
   The expense and logistics of distributing the water - bottled
water must be purchased - has prompted the military to begin using
water taken from oasis wells and processed from the sea.
   ``Those plastic bottles are just a logistical nightmare,'' said
Col. Dan Grigson, public affairs officer for the Army's 101st
airborne division. ``So we hope to wean soldiers off the bottle.''
   Repeated inquiries on the number of bottles of water consumed by
U.S. soldiers were not answered by the armed forces. However,
dehydration is one of the main problems treated by field hospitals
as soldiers are prone to ignore their daily ration.
   The average consumption of water per soldier in September ranged
between five and 11 gallons per day, including that used for
showers and washing.
   The soldiers have no great love for the chlorinated water
produced by mixing oasis water with chemicals.
   ``It's like drinking the swimming pool,'' said Sgt. Joseph
Copley, 25, of Mansfield, Ohio.
   Because of the daily minimum requirement, the water is a
constant topic of conversation. Even in the midst of night
maneuvers, two soldiers were overheard discussing the subject.
   ``I drank that water for two weeks before they started putting
in the chlorine and I never got sick,'' said one.
   ``It made you ugly,'' the other joked in answer.
   ``No, that came from eating MREs,'' said the first soldier,
referring to the military field rations called
``meals-ready-to-eat.''
   Troops get packages of flavored powder such as lemon-lime or
grape in the MREs which they dump into the water, but they don't
have enough to disguise the amount they must drink. Sometimes they
use cocoa.
   ``Here it is 120 degrees outside and the water is so hot they
would rather drink hot cocoa than hot water,'' said Marunale, a
company commander with the Aviation Brigade of the 24th Mechanized
Infantry Division.

   President Bush, heckled on the campaign
trail, battled Tuesday against signs of dwindling public support
for U.S. involvement in the Middle East. ``America will remain in
the Persian Gulf not one single day longer than necessary,'' he
promised.
   Bush said U.S. forces must stay in the gulf until Iraq's Saddam
Hussein withdraws his army from Kuwait.
   ``If we don't stand up against aggression around the world when
it's naked and brutal, who will?,'' Bush asked on a three-state
campaign swing stretching from Des Moines, Iowa, to Grand Rapids,
Mich.
   Three protesters disrupted Bush's speech at a political
fund-raiser before more than 1,000 people in the Des Moines Civic
Center. ``Mr. President, bring our troops home from Saudi Arabia,''
one young man shouted.
   ``Stop the buildup. ... No war for oil,'' the trio shouted
before being hustled away by police.
   Bush was loudly applauded when he responded, ```The fight isn't
about oil. The fight is about naked aggression that will not
stand.''
   Two women interrupted Bush at a fieldhouse rally at DuPage
College in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn. Addressing himself to
the protesters, Bush said, ``What we are for is peace in the Middle
East. What we are also for is principle.''
   He appeared irritated at the disruptions. ``I'm so glad we have
free speech here, but once in a while, you know, we ought to get on
with our business.''
   The disturbances coincided with the release of a Washington
Post-ABC News Poll showing a sharp drop in support for U.S.
involvement in the Persian Gulf, where more than 200,000 Americans
are on duty.
   The survey said 60 percent of people questioned believe the
United States should keep troops in the region until Iraq withdraws
from Kuwait. Five weeks ago, the figure had been 75 percent.
   Support for Bush's handling of the gulf crisis has dropped from
78 percent in September to 64 percent in the most recent Post-ABC
poll.
   Bush said he understood the passions of the demonstrators.
   ``I went through World War II,'' he said. ``We've been through a
couple of agonizing periods, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, so
their views shouldn't be entirely written off.
   ``But they've got it wrong. They've got the facts wrong,'' he
said. ``They're looking introspectively in a bit of an
isolationistic way. You can't do that. We have the responsibility
to lead, the United States does.''
   Bush said the United States ``has the responsibility to lead and
to put together this coalition that says to Saddam Hussein very
simply, you cannot bully your neighbor, you cannot wipe out a
member of the Arab League, a member of the United Nations.''
   The president recounted stories of atrocities committed in
occupied Kuwait by Iraqi forces, such as babies being taken off
incubators and patients removed from dialysis machines so the
equipment could be moved to Baghdad.
   Bush said, ``The bottom line for us is Iraqi aggression will not
be allowed to stand, Saddam Hussein will be held accountable and
the legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored.''
   Vowing that U.S. forces will not remain longer than necessary,
Bush said, ``I look forward to the day when every single man and
woman serving there now with pride, and beautifully trained, every
single one of them comes home. But we must stay for as long as it
takes to complete our mission.''
   His comments were loudly cheered.
   Bush campaigned in Iowa fo the reelection of Republican Gov.
Terry Branstad, favored in the polls, and for Rep. Tom Tauke, who
is struggling to replace Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
   In Illinois, Bush sought to boost the chances of Jim Edgar, the
GOP candidate for governor, who is in a close race with Democrat
Neil Hartigan.
   Bush's last stop for the day was Michigan, where neither
Republican gubernatorial candidate John Engler nor GOP Sen.
challenger Bill Schuette was given more than a long-shot chance of
upsetting the Democratic incumbents.

<HEAD>Former S&amp;L Owner's Trial on Bank Fraud Begins Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Highflying former savings and loan owner Donald
Ray Dixon goes on trial Wednesday on charges he used depositors'
money to finance lavish acquisitions, leaving taxpayers with a $1.3
billion federal bailout.
   Dixon, 50, traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired
such trinkets as a 17th Century castle door, Baccarat crystal,
Remington sculptures, a silver-studded saddle and a posh house in
Solana Beach, Calif., just north of San Diego.
   The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to
prostitutes and political campaigns, were financed from the vaults
at Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, which collapsed under the
weight of Dixon's excess in 1987 and was taken over by the
government.
   A dozen other Vernon executives and associates have preceded
Dixon in court; 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against
two others was set aside because the jury discussed Dixon's
indictment.
   ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they'll listen, they'll
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly
assessed and properly assigned,'' Dixon said in July when he was
arraigned on a 38-count indictment.
   The indictment charged him with conspiracy, misapplication of
funds, making false statements and other crimes.
   Jury selection was to begin Wednesday in federal court.
Testimony is expected to begin Monday, and continue three to four
weeks. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up
to 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million.
   An extra-large panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called
because of publicity in the case, said Jean Hiller, court
coordinator for U.S. District Judge Joe A. Fish.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis of Dallas said 40 to 50
prosecution witnesses could testify. Included on that list is a
convicted madam, who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes
for Vernon executives when they were in San Diego.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the case
this week, citing a instructions from Fish.
   Until the recent notoriety given Neal Bush and Silverado Savings
and Loan in Colorado or Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and
Loan in California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the
list of abuses cited in the industry.
   Dixon's trial is an effort ``to bring to justice people who
break the law, who use savings and loan associations as personal
piggy banks, and who may have thought they could just walk away
free and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their
greed,'' said Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director
in Washington.
   Vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth $6
million. The S&amp;L also paid the $22,000 tab for Dixon's gastronomic
tour of European restaurants, the government said.
   Dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such
politicians as former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack Kemp, a
former Republican congressman from New York who is now Secretary of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal
sources, prosecutors have said.
   When regulators closed Vernon, it was the largest thrift bailout
in history, and it remains among the most expensive. Most of the
expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the
government takeover.
   When regulators closed Vernon, they renamed it Monfort Savings
Association. In December 1988, Monfort was one of five insolvent
thrifts combined to create First Gibraltar Bank, the largest
savings and loan in Texas.
   Vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an
S&amp;L officer. Former Chairman Woody F. Lemons was sentenced to 30
years in prison earlier this year.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Agrees to Study of Bridge Access to Ellis Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee on Tuesday cleared the way
for a National Park Service study on the feasibility of making
permanent a pedestrian bridge to Ellis Island and the Statue of
Liberty.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the study proposal
from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., as part of the 1991 Interior
Appropriations bill.
   The measure aimed at easing access to Ellis Island still faces
approval by the full Senate.
   The foot bridge, which connects Liberty State Park in New Jersey
with Ellis Island, has been used by construction workers
rehabilitating the immigration center. It was slated to be phased
out in 1992. However, New Jersey lawmakers upset at the $6
per-person cost of getting to the monuments by ferry have suggested
the bridge be retained.
   They include Gov. Jim Florio and Rep. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J.,
whose district includes Liberty State Park, a departure point for
the ferry.
   Opponents include the National Parks Service and Circle
Line-Statue of Liberty Inc., which operates the ferry service. The
company is considering a fare increase to $8 a person, according to
recent congressional testimony.
   ``Ellis Island is part of our national heritage,'' said
Lautenberg. ``Affordable access must be available to all Americans
wishing to visit the island.''

million, police and Finance Ministry officials said Tuesday. That
is more than double the cost of policing Emperor Hirohito's funeral
early last year.
   Japan's largest radical left group, the Chukaku-ha, through its
official organ, ``Advance,'' has threatened to disrupt next month's
coronation-related ceremonies. Its attacks are generally aimed at
property, not people.
   Authorities refused to comment on what kind of security was
planned.
   About 32,000 police officers were deployed in Tokyo for
Hirohito's funeral in a security operation that cost the government
$18.4 million.
   In the weeks before the funeral, police, often dressed in full
riot gear, conducted random inspections of automobiles and searched
strategically located buildings. Frogmen were called out to secure
rivers and bay areas in Tokyo. Manholes near the palace were
checked and sealed.
   A spokesman for Japan's largest opposition party, the
Socialists, called the funeral an example of ``excessive
security.''
   Little of that kind of police presence is visible in Tokyo yet,
although some checkpoints have been set up on major streets.
   Emperor Akihito assumed the throne immediately after his father
died in January 1989 but the formal enthronement had to be delayed
for a yearlong mourning period.
   The event will include a state coronation ceremony and parade
Nov. 12. The ``Daijosai,'' or Great Food Offering Ritual, will be
conducted according to the customs of Japan's native religion of
Shinto the night of Nov. 22.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and Prince Charles, heir to the
British throne, are among the dignitaries scheduled to attend the
coronation.
   Before the funeral, police said tight security was needed to
protect the representatives of 163 countries, including President
Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   But their ``steamroller'' approach was widely criticized as
violating residents' human rights, and also because it did not stop
leftist radicals from setting off a bomb along the funeral
procession route.
   The blast, which sent mud and debris across the road but injured
no one, went off about 20 minutes before the procession passed by.
   Japan's radical left has little support among the general
public, but remains visible by frequently using violence to
publicize its aims.
   The Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction, has a membership
estimated in the thousands. The group, whose members wear helmets
and bandanas to cover their faces, has a well-known, heavily
guarded headquarters in northern Tokyo.
   Before Hirohito's funeral, the Chukaku-ha claimed it had mortars
able to launch projectiles as far as a few miles.
   So far this year, radicals have claimed responsibility for 53
incidents, 40 involving imperial targets such as shrines or
buildings used by palace employees.

   President Bush signed a bill Tuesday
expanding the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission to
intervene during stock market emergencies and to monitor major Wall
Street players.
   Bush said the measure would ``improve the stability of America's
vital securities markets and the protection of tens of millions of
investors.''
   The White House announced Bush's action during a GOP campaign
stop in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn.
   The measure will allow the commission to regulate program
trading during times of extreme market turbulence. Program trading
is the use of computers to execute scores, even hundreds, of
separate trades all at once, frequently in combination with trades
in financial futures markets at the same time.
   The bill also expands the authority of the SEC chairman to shut
down the securities markets, with presidential permission, in times
of market emergency. Previously only the president could order a
trading halt.
   Other provisions:
   -Require large securities traders to report their market
positions to the commission.
   -Mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks, options
and futures contracts between the SEC and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   -Require the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, the
CFTC and SEC to report annually to Congress on their efforts to
protect the integrity of the markets.
   -Give the SEC authority to assess the financial health of the
parent holding companies of broker-dealers.
   While hailing the bill, Bush said part of it was ``still
troubling.''
   ``The final language of the bill gives the SEC only carefully
limited and narrow authority to control trading practices and is an
improvement over earlier versions of the legislation,'' Bush said.
   ``However, it is still important that this authority be
carefully and judiciously exercised to prevent any interference
with technological innovations in financial markets that can
enhance market liquidity,'' the president added.
   ``We must be careful not to damage the vitality of America's
markets at the same time that we protect market stability.''

<HEAD>Exiled Kuwaiti Gov't Rules Out Concessions to Iraq</HEAD>

   Kuwait's government-in-exile on Tuesday ruled out conceding
``one inch'' of territory to Iraq in any settlement, and the United
States said it would not accept partial solutions to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The comments followed hints that Iraq might withdraw from Kuwait
if it is allowed to retain three key areas - two islands
controlling Iraq's access to the gulf and part of an oil field.
   But Iraq took a firm position Tuesday, with the newspaper of
Saddam Hussein's ruling party saying: ``We will not give it
(Kuwait) up even if we fight for it 1,000 years.''
   Japan's government, meanwhile, introduced a proposal in
Parliament that would permit Japanese troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force in the gulf.The plan envisions the
establishment of a non-combat force of civilians and soldiers to
participate behind the lines.
   Japan's constitution forbids sending troops overseas.
   GIs in Saudi Arabia got a surprise visitor Tuesday - comedian
Steve Martin. Martin signed autographs and climbed aboard a tank
during a USO stop.
   Martin was told not perform because of concern by U.S.
commanders that American-style humor could offend the Saudis.
   Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister told a news conference
that Iraq's 11-week occupation of his emirate will ``never force us
to make any concession.''
   ``We will never give up any part of our country, not even one
inch,'' Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah said in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia.
   Kuwaitis fleeing into Saudi Arabia said the Iraqis were setting
up fences that separate most of Kuwait from the disputed oil field
of Rumailah. But Iraq repeatedly has denied speculation that it
would withdraw in return for territorial concessions.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Washington also would
not agree to concessions.
   ``We are unwilling to engage in a search for partial
solutions,'' Baker said.
   He said Saddam evidently was interested ``in a negotiated
arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from his
unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor.''
   President Bush, on the campaign trail in Iowa, encountered signs
of dwindling public support for U.S. involvement in the gulf.
``America will remain in the Persian Gulf not one single day longer
than necessary,'' he promised.
   Bush was loudly applauded when he responded to three protesters,
``The fight isn't about oil. The fight is about naked aggression
that will not stand.''
   The United States has massed nearly 200,000 troops in the
Persian Gulf region since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The
United Nations has imposed a land, sea and air embargo on Iraq.
   Jordan's King Hussein, who has worked to try to find a peaceful
solution to the crisis, said in remarks published Tuesday that war
may be imminent.
   Hussein told The New York Times that the outbreak of war would
be partly the fault of Bush and other Western leaders, who he said
failed to respond promptly to Saddam's early indications he was
willing to withdraw.
   Also Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev dispatched
an envoy to the West to seek a peaceful end to the crisis. A Soviet
spokesman said Yevgeny Primakov, recently back from talks with
Saddam in Baghdad, would visit Rome and Paris, then meet Bush in
Washington.
   ``The Soviet leadership believes that if there is a smallest
chance to settle the conflict peacefully that chance should be used
to the ultimate,'' Gorbachev spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said in
Moscow.
   Tass reported that Saddam had hinted to Primakov he might be
prepared to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait in exchange for the
two islands and the Rumailah oil field that straddles the
Iraq-Kuwait border.
   Saddam had accused the Kuwaitis of drawing more than their share
of oil from the field.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has also said Saddam was showing
flexibility. But Iraq said Tuesday its position remained firm.
   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said control of Kuwait ``is our final decision, a decision
that all Iraq defends and guards by 6 million fighters.''
   Iraq's army newspaper, Al-Qadissiya, discounted the possiblity
of war before Christmas, saying that Bush was not likely to allow
American soldiers to come home in coffins during the holiday
season.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   -Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Libya would mobilize atn soldiers
if needed in the gulf crisis, the nation's
official news agency reported.
   Gadhafi, however, did not say which side the troops would fight
on o
least a millior what would prompt the mobilization. The dispatch by Libya's
JANA news agency said he made the remark in a speech Monday.
   -Honduras said it will send a military force to Saudi Arabia to
join the multinational force. Argentina was the first Latin
American nation to pledge military personnel to the force.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: Cron said.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For the major part of his career, Blakey did his drumming for
the Jazz Messengers, the band that came together under his
leadership in the early 1950s.
   Dizzy Gillespie, the giant of be-bop, once described Blakey as
``the volcano'' of be-bop drummers. He was considered in the top
echelon that included such drummers as Max Roach and Buddy Rich.
   In a television film about Blakey's career, a Jazz Messengers
alumnus, pianist Walter Davis, said: ``I think no one in jazz has
brought more great musicians to music that Art Blakey.''
   The 1981 Newport Jazz Festival gave over an evening to ``The
Blakey Legacy,'' in which the drummer was joined by the players who
had been with his band during the previous quareer century.
   Blakey denied being a teacher, saying that as a self-taught
musician, ``I don't know anything myself.''
   But another time he said, ``When I take these 18-year-old kids
out on tour, it makes most of the pros feel like cutting their
wrists. ... They're going to take the music farther than it has
been.''
   Among the musicians who got a start with Blakey's band have been
horn players Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, Clifford Brown and
Chuck Mangione, saxophonists Jackie McLean, Wayne Shorter and
Johnny Griffin, pianists Keith Jarrett and Walter Davis.
   Blakey was born in Pittsburgh in 1919, escaping the steel mills
as a 15-year-old by playing piano at a nightclub. Then a
14-year-old hotshot named Erroll Garner showed up and ``I was told
to go to the drums by the club owner,'' Blakey recalled.
   The young Blakey caught on with Fletcher Henderson's band and
went on to Billy Eckstine's big band in the mid-1940s, when he
first worked with Gillespie and Charlie Parker.
   The Jazz Messengers band was formed in 1954 by Blakey, pianist
Horace Silver, trumpeter Kenny Dorham and saxophonist Hank Mobley.
The band toured Europe and played all around the United States for
the next three decades, including a White House performance in
1981.
   Blakey's jazz drummer son, Art Jr., died in 1988 at age 47.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Loan To Iraq Shows Need To Monitor Foreign Banks In
US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A national board may be needed to monitor
foreign banks operating in the United States such as an Italian
institution that secretly lent several billion dollars to Iraq, the
chairman of the House Banking Committee said Tuesday.
   Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which is owned by the Italian
government and is Italy's second-largest bank, lent $1.9 billion to
Iraq through its Atlanta office until August 1989, when it was
raided by the FBI and Federal Reserve.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, called the scandal ``a case
study in regulatory failure'' and said the current system of
dividing responsibility for regulating foreign bank offices among
federal and state agencies is inadequate.
   ``Maybe it is time we established a national screening board to
monitor more closely foreign bank presence in the United States,''
he suggested.
   ``Such a screening board could review applications for foreign
bank entry into the United States as well as monitor these banks to
ensure they are not engaged in foreign policy activities.''
   According to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, 557
state-licensed foreign banks with $622 billion in assets operate in
the United States. Another 80 financial institutions with $33
billion in assets are licensed by the Treasury Department's Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Regulators, appearing before Gonzalez' panel, said the current
system was adequate but warned that cases like that of Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro are difficult to prevent.
   ``This was a situation that involved massive fraud in which a
large number of employees acted together to conceal the operation
and deceive auditors and examiners,'' said William Taylor, director
of banking supervision at the Federal Reserve.
   ``The physical segregation of records, together with the
concerted efforts of key employees, make it extremely difficult for
examiners to uncover this type of illicit and fraudulent
activity,'' he said.
   Some of the Italian bank's lending was guaranteed by the
Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corp. Because Iraq
stopped paying its debts after invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, U.S.
taxpayers will be on the hook for $2 billion through the Commodity
Credit Corp., including $347 million loaned by Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro. Taxpayers will lose another $55 million guaranteed through
the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Lavoro scandal was ``an
inevitable result of the poorly managed and ill conceived''
Agriculture Department loan guarantee program.
   ``In effect, we've doled out billions of dollars of free money
which enabled Saddam Hussein to build the powerful nation that
confronts us today,'' he said.
   Pietro Lombardi, executive vice resident in charge of the
Italian bank's North American operations, said the Atlanta office's
lending was conducted without the knowledge or approval of bank
executives in New York and Rome.
   While the activity may have been unauthorized and improperly
reported, loans to Iraq at the time were ``not illegal or in any
way inconsistent with the policy of the United States,'' he said.
   The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of
the affair and Tuesday's committee hearing was held over the
protests of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who had warned it
could hurt prosecutors' efforts.

<TEXT>
   Comedian Steve Martin, who
bills himself as ``that wild and crazy guy,'' was told to be tame
and sane in a visit to U.S. troops Tuesday.
   ``They said they didn't want us to do a show,'' Martin told
soldiers at Camp Midway, a base for the 24th Mechanized Infantry
Division.
   Martin's subdued manner reflected concern by U.S. commanders
about Saudi sensibilities. While they are eager to have celebrities
visit the Desert Shield forces, they fear some American-style humor
could offend the Saudis.
   It was the third stop of the day for Martin and and his wife,
actress Victoria Tennant, who are on a weeklong USO tour.
   During his hour at the camp, Martin donned a helmet and goggles
for a brief ride on an M-1 tank, signed autographs and a homemade
``Steve Martin for President'' poster, and cracked only one joke
relating to the gulf crisis.
   ``I have the answer to Saddam Hussein. If the press would just
keep talking about his mistress, his wife would kill him.''
   In a recent interview, U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the
overall commander of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, said the
Americans were ``trying in every possible way to be culturally
sensitive ... without depriving our troops of what we think they
should have.''
   U.S. officials had earlier canceled troops' attendance at a show
staged by some American civilians after Saudi objections to women
revealing too much leg.
   About 500 troops, sitting on a sand dune littered with empty
soft drink cans, waited about three hours in 104-degree heat before
Martin's group arrived aboard two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters.
   They cheered wildly when Martin and his wife climbed on the
tank, and the comedian cracked, ``We're going to put up a condo
here.''
   The stars wore camouflage fatigues and red USO baseball caps,
adorned with pilots' wings and souvenirs from earlier stops.
   It was clear the soldiers had expected Martin to do a comedy
routine.
   But after telling them ``we appreciate what you guys are
doing,'' Martin said, ``what we're going to do is what they call
grip and grin - we grip your hand and grin at you. It's all we can
do.''
   He posed for pictures, greeted individual soldiers and handed
out cards.
   ``Don't squeeze too hard,'' he told one.
   Kevin McCarthy, a USO executive producer, said the organization
has discussed visits with several other entertainers, but gave no
names.
   He said this was Martin's first military tour.
   ``It's only our second day here. We know it's a long trip and
we're trying to pace it a little bit so we can make it the whole
week. It's pretty hectic,'' McCarthy said.
   After climbing into the turret of the M-1 tank and whirling
around the camp in a cloud of sand, Martin told some soldiers that
``there'll be more people coming,'' mentioning boxer Thomas Hearns.
   When a trooper asked, ``Can't you stay?'' Martin quipped, ``I've
got a meeting.''
   Martin said he has generally avoided political issues.
   ``I'm not here as a political person, but as friend of people,''
he said.
   ``I felt guilty, everybody coming out here, giving up part of
their lives for this effort. I had some time off and I felt kind of
bad just sitting there, so I came.''

<HEAD>Withdrawals From S&amp;Ls Slow In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Net withdrawals from the nation's savings and
loans slowed to $7 billion in May after soaring to a record $15.1
billion a month earlier, the government said Tuesday.
   Depositors withdrew $3.2 billion from 2,471 solvent S&amp;Ls and
another $3.8 billion from the 312 failed institutions operated
under government control, the Office of Thrift Supervision said.
   That compares with a net outflow in April of $9.6 billion at
solvent institutions and $5.4 billion at government-run thrifts.
   For the first five months of the year, withdrawals totaled $46.4
billion compared with $35.6 billion during the same period a year
ago.
   Overall, it was the 23rd outflow in 24 months. While analysts
attributed withdrawals in 1989 and earlier to lack of depositor
confidence in S&amp;Ls, the recent outflow is described as a deliberate
strategy of shrinking to meet the tough financial standards imposed
in August 1989 by the S&amp;L bailout law.
   Thrifts wrote $14.8 billion in new mortgages in May, up from
$13.9 billion a month earlier but less than $16.4 billion a year
earlier. The sluggish economy is holding back the housing market,
according to economists.
   S&amp;Ls in May held $902 billion in deposits and had assets of $1.2
trillion.
   The thrift office is about three months behind in its reporting
of financial data. In past years, deposit activity through August
would be available by now.

<TEXT>
   Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the
Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her
tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of
imaginary Victorian poets.
   The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the
$39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for ``Possession,'' one of six
finalists in the 21-year-old competition.
   Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel,
``The Remains of the Day.''
   Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's
panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan
Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
   ``There was very strong individual support for several books on
the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the
winner by a majority vote,'' said the judges.
   ``The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the
standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this
made their decision unusually interesting and unusually
difficult.''
   Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish
Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work,
has published five novels since 1964.
   In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece
together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian
poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets'
journeys across England and to France. The influence of the past on
the living is a theme throughout the book.
   Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister
of novelist Margaret Drabble.
   Her first novel, ``Shadow of a Sun,'' concerned the efforts of a
woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father. A 1978 work,
``The Virgin in the Garden,'' makes allegorical allusions to
Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play
performed at a country house.
   Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University
College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime.
   Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope
Fitzgerald with ``The Gate of Angels,'' Irish novelist John
McGahern's ``Amongst Women,'' Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's
``Solomon Gursky Was Here,'' Brian Moore's ``Lies of Silence,'' and
Beryl Bainbridge's ``An Awfully Big Adventure.'' They were chosen
from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989.
   The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust. It is
Britain's top literary award.

<TEXT>
   A Cabinet minister was quoted Tuesday as
saying that Western hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in
Lebanon are about to be freed.
   Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul said Syrian President Hafez
Assad's government has ``achieved progress'' in its efforts to free
the hostages, who include six Americans.
   ``The question of the hostages is about to come to an end. Our
Syrian brothers are carrying out contacts and have achieved
progress,'' Dalloul was quoted as saying by the leftist Beirut
newspaper As-Safir.
   The daily said Dalloul declined to set a specific date for the
release or say whether the hostages would come out together or
separately.
   ``We should not talk about this subject so that we would not
spoil the ongoing efforts,'' Dalloul, a pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem,
was quoted as saying.
   Another Lebanese leader close to Syria, Abdulla al-Amin, said
efforts to free the hostages are not likely to be affected by the
crushing of rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's 11-month mutiny on
Saturday.
   ``The attack on Aoun's enclave cannot be linked with the issue
of the foreign hostages. Here are two totally separate issues,''
al-Amin told The Associated Press.
   There has been speculation that Syria's preoccupation with
preparations and execution of the Syrian-led blitz would delay the
anticipated release of British hostages.
   Media reports before the assault on Aoun's enclave said Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite and possibly British journalist John
McCarthy would be released in a matter of days.
   These reports said the move would be a result of the resumption
of diplomatic relations between Britain and Iran and a subsequent
visit to Tehran by the Syrian president last month.
   The attack on Aoun was mounted by President Elias Hrawi's army
and Syrian troops from three directions, one of which was south
Beirut's Shiite Moslem slums, where most of the Western captives
are believed held.
   Militiamen of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, have since been clashing with a pro-Syrian Christian
militia in suburban Hadath, a Christian residential district close
to the Shiite slums.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella of underground Shiite
fanatics holding most of the Westerners in Lebanon.
   Waite disappeared in Moslem west Beirut Jan. 20, 1987, after
leaving his hotel for a meeting with hostage holders. He was trying
to negotiate the release of hostages.
   No group has claimed to hold Waite. But former Irish hostage
Brian Keenan, who was released in August, said he was held n the
same house as Waite for a while.
   McCarthy was kidnapped April 17, 1986 while driving to Beirut
airport to catch a flight to London.
   The missing Westerners include six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans, and an Italian. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Shiite leader Hussein Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian wing in
Hezbollah, has said British hostages would be released first
because of the improvement in British-Iranian relations, and that
U.S.-led military deployment in Saudi Arabia had dimmed chances of
early release for Americans.

   The new-fangled field rations scorned by U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia must indeed be hard to swallow if even the
Army's top officer is making fun of them.
   Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army chief of staff, drew roars of
laughter during an address to a military conference Tuesday when he
jokingly said the rations, called Meals-Ready-to-Eat, or MREs,
aren't as bad as they're made out to be.
   ``They're humorously maligned by a lot of people,'' Vuono
understated, ``but I want to dispel the story that has been going
around'' among troops in the Saudi desert that even the camels
wandering into Army camps can't stand the MREs.
   ``One such camel, while observing one of our soldiers enjoying
his delicious MRE, thrust his hairy face right in the soldier's lap
and grabbed his MRE.
   ``After chewing for a few seconds - so the story goes - the
camel spit the meal out in disgust and angrily chased our great
trooper across the Saudi desert.
   ``Now look, that's the myth that's going around,'' Vuono said,
adding, tongue-in-cheek, that he had tracked down the soldier and
had gotten the true story of the camel's reaction.
   ``Yes, one camel did in fact steal that trooper's MRE. But, far
from rejecting the meal, the camel munched the MRE with great
pleasure, enjoyed the hot sauce, ... belched contentedly and gave
our soldier a great kiss on the cheek.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today unveiled a new plan to
rescue the Soviet economy, eliminating a 500-day deadline for
switching to a market system.
   The 66-page blueprint, delivered to committees of the Soviet
legislature and signed by the Soviet president, is at least the
fourth recent plan for reviving the economy.
   It is the result of a three-week, behind-the-scenes effort by
Gorbachev and the country's top economists to resolve fundamental
differences over how to move away from a centrally planned system
that fails to provide adequate food, shelter or services for the
country's 285 million people.
   ``People's lives are becoming more difficult, their interest in
labor is falling, their faith in the future is crumbling,'' the
plan says.
   The plan, which Gorbachev is scheduled to present to the full
542-member Supreme Soviet on Friday, sets no time limit for
switching to a market economy but states: ``The experience of
applying stabilization programs in other countries ... shows that
such a period can take about 1{ to two years.''
   It would give the Soviet republics a powerful voice and new
flexibility in running the country's economy.
   ``The main guidelines will determine only the principal
approaches. Every republic, Moscow and Leningrad have the right to
act as they like within the framework of these guidelines,''
Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, told reporters today.
   The plan calls for establishment of an ``inter-republic economic
committee'' to oversee reforms and for republic representatives to
be included in central executive bodies. Ignatenko called the
committee a departure from the tradition of ministries in Moscow
dictating to thousands of factories, farms and businesses what to
produce, where to sell it and at what price.
   In 1992, the plan says, only the prices of bread, meat, dairy
products and a few other staples would remain fixed by the state.
That is a slower transition to free pricing than envisioned in a
draft prepared by Soviet economist Stanislav Shatalin, which
envisoned a 500-day deadline.
   Under Gorbachev's plan, republics would have the right to
override price increases allowed by central authorities, and to
control most of the resources on their territory.
   To reduce the huge amount of money that Soviets have stashed
away in personal savings, the government would accept advance
payment for scarce and expensive goods such as cars, computers,
furniture, telephones, housing and rural plots. The goods would be
delivered when they became available, and the government would not
pay interest on the money in the interim.
   Shatalin's plan received stong support from reformers such as
Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation. Gorbachev
earlier said he preferred elements of the Shatalin plan to those in
another proposal offered by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.

   The deficit-reduction legislation Congress plans to vote on this

that's likely to sting, too.
   Congressional votes on budget-cutting packages were expected to

federal deficit over the next five years by about $500 billion,
including $40 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Congressional proponents of the B-2 stealth
bomber are breathing easier after the Senate narrowly rejected an
attempt to stop production of the radar-evading aircraft.
   ``We had to have it,'' Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee and a B-2 proponent, said Monday
night after the Senate approved a $268 billion defense spending
bill.
   By a 50-44 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would
have halted production of the stealth aircraft at six planes - far
short of the 75 that President Bush is seeking at a cost of nearly
$865 million each.
   Backers of the Northrop-built bomber argued that a plane that
can penetrate Soviet air defenses is still needed because of
uncertainty over the future leadership of the Kremlin.

   The 62,000-ton Midway, based at Yokosuka, Japan, and currently
on maneuvers with Japanese self-defense forces, will replace the
USS Independence next month, the sources said on Monday.
   The sources, who asked not to be named, said they did not know
why the World War II-vintage Midway was chosen for the deployment
ahead of one of the Navy's newer carriers.
   The ship has a limited operational capability compared to its

   But some remained bitter Monday after years of legal wrangling
over the issue. Others doubted whether they would actually see any

   President Bush signed a bill during a campaign trip to Dallas on
Monday that provides up to $50,000 to cancer victims who were
exposed to test radiation in three Western states and up to

   On the face of it, the United States government
and environmentalists may seem an unlikely alliance, but allied

whaling in Iceland. In the second of two stories, AP Science Editor

   ``A whale is the most beautiful animal
I have ever seen,'' the poet W.H. Auden wrote during a visit to
Iceland in 1936. ``To see it torn to pieces with steam winches and
cranes is enough to make one a vegetarian for life.''
   That kind of revulsion has helped make the global
save-the-whales campaign one of the most dramatic successes of the
environmental movement. An international moratorium on commercial
whaling was instituted in 1986, and environmentalists now are
pushing for a permanent ban on all whaling.
   ``We would certainly be against whaling until we could
definitely show it would not affect the (whale) stocks,'' says
Kevin Chu. ``If there is any doubt, we want to err on the side of
conservation.''
   That's tough talk - and it doesn't come from an
environmentalist. Chu is a foreign affairs officer in the U.S.
State Department's Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental
and Scientific Affairs.
   Asked to describe the U.S. position on whaling, Chu says: ``The
United States is against it.''
   The perhaps unusual consensus among the government and
environmental groups is fueled by two things: concern that whales
are in danger of extinction and the kind of sentiments evoked by
Auden.
   The government takes a strong anti-whaling stance because ``the
only voices we hear are the voices of the environmentalists,'' Chu
said.
   Iceland, one of the three major whaling nations along with
Norway and Japan, argues strenuously that the whales it wants to
hunt are not endangered and that it should be allowed to resume
commercial whaling.
   But even if scientists eventually agree the populations are
indeed not endangered, the campaign to save the whales is unlikely
to die.
   ``Politically, it comes down to a relatively simple thing,''
said William Evans, the U.S. representative to the International
Whaling Commission. ``There are a number of countries and
scientists that believe . . . there is not a justification, or
need, for any country to continue to harvest these animals.''
   ``I'm completely of the mindset that we have to protect oceans
for our own survival, and the whales are a component of this
ecosystem,'' said Sally Shoup of Greenpeace. ``We have to stop this
devastation of the other creatures on the planet if we want to
protect ourselves.
   ``I think whales are special,'' she said. ``I think they are
intelligent creatures. I think Icelanders can understand that as
well.''
   The save-the-whales campaign began in 1972, when the landmark
U.N. Conference on the Environment, in a 53-0 vote, passed a
resolution calling for a 10-year moratorium on whaling. Whalers
killed 46,000 whales that year.
   The United States immediately proposed the moratorium to the
whaling commission, which rejected it. But the U.S. continued to
push. In 1982, the commission finally approved a moratorium,
beginning in 1986.
   ``What we were going to do was take five years of no whaling,''
said Evans, the U.S. representative to the commission. ``Well, we
haven't had five years of no whaling, because Iceland invented
scientific whaling.''
   A clause in the international whaling convention allows the
killing of whales for scientific purposes. Iceland exploited it.
   ``You have the same boats and the same people and you take the
same whales and you sell it to the same people and you call it
scientific whaling,'' said Roger Payne, a noted whale expert and
president of the Long Term Research Institute in Lincoln, Mass.
``It's a joke.''
   Johann Sigurjonsson, senior whale specialist at Iceland's Marine
Research Institute, vigorously disagreed. ``Those who have been
following what we're doing understand the seriousness of what we're
doing,'' he said.
   In 1985, the last year of its commercial whaling operation,
Iceland killed 344 whales. It caught 116 in 1986, and the number
declined to 68 in 1989. This year, Iceland shut down its whaling
operation entirely, but it continues to press vigorously for a
resumption of commercial killing of fin, sei and minke whales.
   Congress has passed several laws that allow the United States to
impose economic sanctions against countries that violate whaling
commission regulations.
   Iceland's critics have argued that the scientific whaling is
merely commercial whaling under another name, and have pressed the
United States to impose sanctions. The United States might be
reluctant to do so, however, because Iceland is the site of a
strategic NATO base.
   Payne said the methods used to estimate whale populations are
highly imprecise, and that the Icelandic scientific research has
``shown us nothing we didn't know before.''
   It could take as long as 100 years to know how many whales can
be captured without reducing the size of a given whale population,
he said.
   The International Whaling Commission has stopped releasing
estimates
   The NYSE's composite index fell 2.20 to 163.64.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped
2.95 to 290.32.

   Weary of being portrayed as environmental
outlaws for killing whales, Icelanders are fighting back. In the
first of two stories detailing the whaling controversy, AP Science
Editor Paul Raeburn examines Iceland's efforts to overturn an
international moratorium on commercial whaling and protect a way of

<TEXT>
   In a 1989 Icelandic television
documentary entitled ``Survival in the High North,'' Icelanders
talk about the difficulty of making a living on what they call
``the border of the habitable world.''
   A villager who hunted minke whales until a moratorium on
commercial whaling says, in apparent puzzlement, ``It seems to be
incredibly important to stop catching a few minke whales here every
year, but it doesn't seem so important to the world that it is
being destroyed by nuclear pollution and that people are being
killed all over the planet.''
   The villager's lament is heard often in a land where whaling has
been a way of life for centuries. This year, for the first time
since the 1940s, Iceland abandoned whaling, part of a carefully
plotted campaign to overturn the moratorium.
   Iceland, one of the three major whaling nations along with
Norway and Japan, wants to kill whales again.
   ``The whaling industry means to Iceland what the auto industry
means to the U.S.,'' said Guthni Bragasson, spokesman for Iceland's
Foreign Affairs Ministry. Whaling is a small part of the overall
economy, but an important one. But a more telling reason might be
Iceland's very different point of view about the relationship
between people and natural resources. Many people outside Iceland
view whales as magnificent creatures worthy of protection; many
Icelanders view them as just another ocean resource.
   When the moratorium on commercial whaling began in 1986, the aim
was to give scientists time to determine whether they could set
quotas that would allow whaling without endangering the mammals'
survival.
   Iceland immediately exploited a whaling commission loophole by
beginning a program of ``scientific whaling,'' arguing that it
couldn't assess the status of its whale populations without killing
and examining a number of whales.
   That prompted Greenpeace to launch a boycott of Icelandic fish
products. Picket lines appeared outside restaurants in the United
States operated by Burger King, Wendy's and Long John Silver's,
which purchased Icelandic fish.
   ``The Greenpeace campaign was very effective,'' said Gudmundur
Hermannsson, a reporter who covers whaling for Morgunbladid,
Iceland's largest daily newspaper. ``I have a feeling that if there
hadn't been this pressure from Greenpeace, Iceland this year would
have announced a new scientific whaling program.''
   At the International Whaling Commission's meeting in July,
Iceland presented evidence that its whales aren't endangered,
setting the stage for a showdown at the next meeting, to be held in
May in Reykjavik, Iceland's capital.
   ``If they don't accept some whaling, they're not following the
scientific evidence,'' said Jakob Jakobsson, director of the
country's Marine Research Institute.
   ``If they are protecting whales because they are nice, then why
do Minnesotans shoot deer? And why does the royal family hunt fox?
And why does the King of Sweden come here to shoot reindeer, which
he doesn't even eat?''
   Jakobsson is eager to press the point to anyone who will listen;
he sees his country as David fighting the Greenpeace Goliath.
   ``There was no way we could compete with Greenpeace in the
media,'' Bragasson said. Indeed, Greenpeace was honored in August
by the Better World Society ``for using the media and other methods
of communication in the most creative and innovative ways.''
   Are the Icelanders environmental outlaws, as Greenpeace calls
them? Why do they continue whaling in the face of widespread
international condemnation?
   ``Our main point is that these are exploitable animals,'' said
Johann Sigurjonsson, the senior whale specialist at the Marine
Research Institute. ``Nobody in Iceland wants to wipe out the
whales. Nobody wants to wipe out any species.''
   Iceland's population of 250,000, spread thinly along the coast
of a largely uninhabitable volcanic island the size of Virginia,
has depended almost entirely on the sea for survival since the
country was settled by Norsemen and Celts in the 9th century.
   Icelanders had been hunting whales for 600 years before Herman
Melville chronicled Capt. Ahab's fateful pursuit of Moby Dick in
the 19th century. An illustration in the 13th century Icelandic
book of law called the Jonsbok shows a whale being ``flensed,'' or
having its blubber peeled off.
   Iceland's fisheries now account for about 75 percent of its
exports, providing vital foreign exchange for a nation that must
import nearly all of its manufactured goods. Before the whaling
moratorium, whale products made up about 2 percent of Iceland's
exports, Sigurjonsson said.
   Iceland takes pride in its careful stewardship of its marine
resources, and that might be the one point on which Iceland and
Greenpeace agree.
   ``Greenpeace has said repeatedly that Iceland does have one of
the better-managed fisheries in the world,'' said Sally Shoup, a
Greenpeace whale specialist in Washington.
   ``We want to have the responsibility for management of our
resources, because we are the party that will be hurt if the
resources are overexploited,'' Sigurjonsson said. ``People have
been saying, `OK, if we are not allowed to take care of the whales
in our waters, what will be next?' ''
   In 1916, Iceland's parliament, the Althing, banned most whaling
because of concerns about the depletion of whale stocks.
   Whaling resumed briefly in 1935 until it was interrupted by
World War II. The present whaling operation began in 1948 in Whale
Fjord, a deep gorge on Iceland's eastern coast, north of Reykjavik.
   The whaling station consists of a half-dozen red-roofed, yellow
brick buildings on a hillside overlooking a broad concrete pier.
Whales are hoisted up a wide metal ramp onto the pier, where they
are cut up and processed.
   The station was nearly deserted during this summer's whaling
season, the first summer since 1948 that the fjord hadn't resounded
with the rumble of winches and cables and the shouts of whaling
men.
   The action this year was in the Netherlands, at the whaling
commission's meeting. There, Sigurjonsson and other Icelandic
officials argued that the whales they want to hunt are not
endangered in Icelandic waters.
   The whales in question are fin whales, sei whales and small
whales called minke whales, which are hunted by 50 or 60 families
in Iceland but not by the operation at the whaling station.

   Minke whales topped the agenda this year. The minke population
around Iceland, East Greenland and Jan Mayen, a small island
northeast of Iceland, is estimated at 28,000, Sigurjonsson said.
For 40 years, Icelanders have killed 200 to 300 minke whales a
year. Sigurjonsson has concluded that the effect on the population
has been negligible and would not drive minke whales to extinction.
   The data on fin whales will be addressed by the whaling
commission next year. Sigurjonsson estimates 11,500 fin whales are
in the East Greenland-Iceland stock. The annual catch of 230 to 240
fin whales could resume without damage to the stocks, he said.
   Less is known about sei whale stocks, but the killing of 60 to
70 animals per year ``appears not to have substantial impact on the
stock,'' Sigurjonsson said. ``But I stress that we have not
completed our study on that.''
   These numbers have been derived in part from Iceland's
scientific whaling program. Greenpeace and other critics have
contend the killing of whales is not necessary to estimate
populations. Scientific whaling is nothing more than commercial
whaling by another name, they say.
   ``That's a very unfair statement,'' Sigurjonsson said. ``We
believe that lethal research is necessary for certain types of
investigations.''
   Fin whales, for example, dwell not in coastal waters but
offshore. ``It's pretty rough out there,'' Sigurjonsson said. ``If
you want to know the age distribution, and particularly age at
maturity, and the fecundity rate, the quickest way is to sample.''
   Iceland will make a pitch for resumption of minke and fin
whaling next spring, with the completion of studies on the fin
whales. If the International Whaling Commission doesn't allow
Iceland to resume whaling, the country is threatening to withdraw
from the commission. Then, it no longer would be bound by the
moratorium.
   But even if Iceland's efforts to prove its whales are not
endangered ultimately succeed, it's not likely that international
opposition would dissolve.
   Sigurjonsson has acknowledged the widespread belief outside
Iceland ``that because whales are so intelligent and highly
developed, they have the same right as human beings to live without
being harvested.''
   That view is held by one of Iceland's most important trading
partners and, on this issue, one of its most formidable opponents:
the United States government.

   United Airlines has announced plans to buy as

in an order worth at least $11 billion and potentially a record $22
billion or more.
   The deal announced Monday includes Boeing's new 777 model, the

for Boeing over its leading competitors, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and Airbus Industrie of Europe.
   It also came a week after a protracted employee effort to buy

   NEW YORK (AP) - A former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader
testified that Michael Milken ``without a doubt'' manipulated a
stock, but he offered no direct evidence of the crime.
   Peter Gardiner also said he was told Milken authorized an order
that Drexel workers destroy documents after learning speculator
Ivan Boesky was cooperating with the government's securities fraud
probe in November 1986.
   Gardiner's testimony Monday came on the second day of a special
hearing in Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors are trying to show
Milken committed more crimes than the six he admitted in a plea
bargain and therefore deserves a harsh sentence.

   DETROIT (AP) - Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks fell 2.1 percent in early October, continuing a slump that
began when the 1989 model year ended last September, the companies
said.
   The automakers sold cars and trucks during the Oct. 1-10 period
at an average daily rate of 30,096, compared with a rate of 30,734
during the same time last year, the companies said Monday.
   Car sales by the Big Three - GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. - dropped 1.5 percent while sales of domestically made cars
with Japanese nameplates rose 42.6 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Business inventories inched up 0.5 percent in
August despite a 2.1 percent gain in sales, the government said.
Analysts said while the imbalance bears watching, it was not at a
dangerous level.
   Analysts watch for signs of undue inventory growth during
periods of economic weakness because unusually large backlogs could
cause production cutbacks and loss of jobs, adding even more stress
to the economy.
   Some analysts believe the figures released Monday were another
indicator the economy is headed toward a recession this year, if
it's not already in one.

ministry said Monday.
   In trade with the United States, Japan's surplus narrowed to
$4.31 billion in September from $4.78 billion a year earlier.
Exports to the United States fell 5.7 percent to $8.26 billion,
while imports grew by 1.5 percent to $3.96 billion.

   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Kuwaiti Oil Minister Rashid

   Ameeri, who is with the Kuwaiti government-in-exile set up in
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, told a news conference
Monday that oil prices would increase in the event of hostilities,
but not that high.
   Former Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said recently that
oil prices would rise to $100 dollars a barrel if war broke out.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. airlines, faced with a $10 billion boost
in the cost of jet fuel because of the Persian Gulf crisis, will
incur a $1 billion loss in the final quarter of 1990, the president
of the Air Transport Association said. Robert J. Aaronson said
Monday the airline industry had never loss that much in a whole
year.
   The industry had profits of $170 million on total revenues of
$28 billion in the first six months of the year, the ATA said.
Third-quarter figures were not yet available.

   FREMONT, Calif. (AP) - As expected, Apple Computer Inc. on
Monday unveiled a lower-cost line of its popular Macintosh
machines, tempting consumers but worrying investors and dealers.
   Apple priced the Macintosh Classic at about $1,000, the
Macintosh LC at $2,500 and the Macintosh IIsi starting at about
$3,800. However, shoppers can expect better deals after retailers
discount the products, experts say.
   Analysts said the strategy will work only if the Cupertino-based
company sells enough computers to offset the smaller profit margins
on them.

<HEAD>United's Parent Places Order with Boeing Worth Up to $22 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Boeing 777, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines has ordered as many as 128 new
Boeing airplanes - a deal potentially worth a record $22 billion -
in hopes they will help it reach more destinations more frequently
and more efficiently.
   The agreement includes firm orders for 34 Boeing model 777s and
30 Boeing 747-400s, with a total value of about $11 billion.
   In addition, United has the option to purchase an additional 34
model 777s and 30 model 747-400s. If all those options were
exercised, the total value of the purchase would swell to at least
$22 billion and make it the largest order in history.
   Assembly on the 777s is to start in late 1992. As they are
delivered, United said, they will replace the company's DC-10
planes on domestic routes and provide expansion capacity.
   Delivery of the 747-400s would start in 1994. A number of
747-400s from a previous order are expected before that and will be
used for continued expansion of United's international market.
   Stephen Wolf, chairman of Chicago-based UAL Corp., United's
parent company, said the company would more than double its service
to Europe in 1991 by adding destinations.
   For United customers, Wolf said, the order means ``more service
to more destinations in the world's newest, most modern and
efficient aircraft.''
   ``For our shareholders, it means more revenue growth'' to be
reflected in increased shareholder value.
   ``In short, it will ensure that this company is positioned to
compete aggressively around the world,'' Wolf said.
   The announcement of the deal on Monday was followed by the U.S.
Department of Transportation decision to give the airline authority
to operate a nonstop Chicago-Tokyo route.
   The aircraft deal includes Boeing's new 777 model, the
first-ever order for that plane, and represented a significant coup
for Boeing over its leading competitors, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and Airbus Industrie of Europe.
   It also came a week after a protracted employee effort to buy
United failed, and seemed to signify an attempt by one of the
nation's leading airlines to refocus attention on its long-term
competitive position.
   Wolf declined to discuss plans for financing the order. But he
said it wouldn't affect employee contract negotiations.
   ``We don't intend to ask them to make concessions to pay for the
fleet,'' he said. ``We anticipate raises.''
   Wolf said the expansion ``provides a sense of security'' for
United's 74,000 employees.
   The largest order in the industry, excluding options to purchase
aircraft, is $16.8 billion, made in April 1989 by an Ireland-based
aircraft leasing company, GPA Group Ltd. It ordered a total of 308
planes from Boeing, Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas.

   Here are the commercial aircraft industry's largest deals,
ranked by dollar value based on firm orders.
   -$16.8 billion in April 1989 by Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. for 308
planes from Boeing Co., Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. The Irish leasing company ordered 182 Boeing planes worth
$9.4 billion, 72 planes from McDonnell Douglas worth $3.1 billion,
and 42 Airbus jets worth $4.3 billion. GPA also took options for
another 12 Airbus planes.
   -Approximately $11 billion by United Airlines on Monday for 34
of Boeing's new 777 widebody and 30 747-400s. United also took
options for another 34 777s and 30 747s, which, if exercised, would
bring the value of the total package to more than $22 billion, the
largest in history.
   -$10.7 billion in September 1988 to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
by Delta Air Lines. The airline ordered nine McDonnell Douglas and
nine Boeing planes and took options on another 131 McDonnell
Douglas and 66 Boeing aircraft. The value is estimated by analysts
since Delta did not disclose dollar amounts.
   -$7.1 billion in April 1989 to Boeing by United for 180
aircraft. United also took options for 190 Boeing planes, which if
exercised would bring the total package to $15.74 billion.
   -$6 billion in February 1989 to McDonnell Douglas by American
Airlines for 108 firm orders and 42 options. Value estimated by
industry analysts, since neither the manufacturer nor the buyer
disclosed dolar amounts.
   -Up to $5.2 billion in orders in March 1989 by American for up
to 150 Dutch Fokker-100 short-haul planes and 35 Boeing jets.
American placed firm orders for 75 Fokkers and options for another
75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion. The Boeing order was
for 36 planes, with an estimated value of $1.8 billion to $2.1
billion.
   -$5.04 billion in May 1988 to Boeing and Airbus by International
Lease Finance Corp. Orders were for 100 Boeing jets with options
for 24 more. ILFC ordered 30 Airbus jets.

<HEAD>Early-October Sales Fell 2.1 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2.1 percent decline in early-October sales of
North American-made vehicles doesn't give much of a clue about the
state of the auto industry, analysts say.
   During the Oct. 1-10 period this year, General Motors Corp.'s
car sales soared 15.9 percent from a year earlier, Ford Motor Co.
sales sank 23.8 percent and Chrysler Corp. sales gained 2.6 percent
from last year.
   ``There's almost no way of reading the numbers,'' said auto
analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.
``We're going to need - to get a sense of where this market is -
another couple of 10-day reporting periods.''
   The 10 major companies making cars and trucks in the United
States said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 30,096,
compared with a rate of 30,734 during the same time last year.
   Car sales, spurred by the big GM increase, rose 1.9 percent
while truck sales dropped 9.5 percent.
   Car sales by the Big Three dropped 1.5 percent while sales of
domestically made cars with Japanese nameplates rose 42.6 percent.
GM, Ford and Chrysler had 89.4 percent of the domestic car market
in early October.
   The companies together have been battling a slumping sale rate
ever since the 1989 model year technically ended Sept. 30, 1989.
During the last quarter of 1989, the sales rate fell to its lowest
levels of the year.
   Car and truck sales rates tend to drop in early October mainly
because of the deals offered in September as the model year closes
out. GM was particularly aggressive with incentives in September
1989, making cars and trucks more attractive to consumers who had
planned on buying later in the year.
   Consequently, GM's early-October combined car and truck sales
pace last year was particularly low. A year-to-year comparison
showed a 13.3 percent rise in GM's early-October sales. Ford's car
and truck sales fell 21.3 percent in early October and Chrysler's
dropped 10.8 percent.
   That bucks a trend of GM and Ford being down slightly and
Chrysler's down more.
   ``There's a lot of noise in the numbers,'' said Ford sales
analyst Joel Pitcoff.
   For the year through Oct. 10, domestic car and truck sales were
down 4.6 percent, with car sales falling 5.1 percent and truck
sales off 3.7 percent. GM's sales were down 5 percent, Ford's were
off 9.1 percent and Chrysler's declined 14.6 percent.
   Sales figures are being affected by a wide variety of things - a
slump in the general economy, declining consumer confidence, rising
gasoline prices, big incentives on 1990 model cars and little ones
on '91 versions and purchases by fleets, including rental car
companies and large corporations.
   Chrysler, which recently returned to the fleet business, has
shown increases in its car sales during the last two periods.
   The company said its combined car and truck sales for early
October were 10.8 percent lower than last year, with car sales
rising 2.6 percent and truck sales dropping 26 percent.
   Ford said its early October car sales fell 23.8 percent and
truck sales were down 17.2 percent, combining for a 21.3 percent
decline in vehicle sales.
   GM said its vehicle sales were up 13.3 percent over last year.
In addition to the 15.9 percent increase in car sales, GM's light
truck sales were up 7.3 percent.

<HEAD>State Announces Largest Automaker Refund Concession in Nation's
History</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A settlement between the state and 12 major
automakers will provide up to $100 million in refunds to consumers
under the state's ``Lemon Law.''
   The settlement announced Monday was believed to be the largest
such refund ever by automakers and could set a precedent for other
states, officials said.
   Within the next month, automakers will place advertisements
detailing the details of the refund plan in major New York
newspapers. The ads will run for six weeks and consumers have 4{
months to respond.
   The settlement covers all New York residents who bought or
leased new cars after Aug. 2, 1986, and who were forced to pay for
repairs that should have been covered by warranty.
   The repair must have been made after the manufacturer's basic
warranty expired (normally duringthe first 12 months or 12,000
miles, whichever came first), but before the first 24 months or
18,000 miles, or whichever came first.
   The state's ``Lemon Law'' requires manufacturers and their
dealers to make repairs under their warranty, at no cost to the
customer, for a period of two years or 18,000 miles, whichever
comes first.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said Monday that the
settlement was the result of a ``long-fought effort'' of four years
to get the auto manufacturers to agree on the terms.
   The car makers who entered into the agreement are: Chrysler,
Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mitsubishi,
Nissan, Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. Each company also paid the state
$10,000 in costs, for a total of $120,000. But they did not admit
wrongdoing in signing the settlement.
   Car makers such as Mercedes-Benz were not included in the
settlement because their warranty programs are broader than the
state's lemon law, Abrams said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Itel Corp. announced it will buy back the 18.7
million shares owned by the Henley Group, Inc., using proceeds from
the sale of its container business.
   Itel said Monday it will sell the container operation to General
Electric Capital Corp. for $825 million.
   The deal will return to Itel a 38.5 percent stake it gave Henley
in 1988 in exchange for a 17 percent share of Santa Fe Pacific
Corp. and other assets.
   In the 1988 deal, the Itel shares represented about $373 million
of a $1.2 billion transaction.
   Chicago-based Itel said it is buying back the shares for $375
million.
   Itel said the sale of its container leasing and servicing assets
will result in a pre-tax earnings gain of about $250 million.
   The stock repurchase will ``provide an excellent opportunity to
maximize shareholder value,'' Itel President Rod Dammeyer said in a
statement.
   The sale will leave Itel with interests in railcar leasing,
dredging services, and wire and cable distribution.
   Henley's principal business is laboratory and medical equipment.
It has headquarters in La Jolla, Calif., and Hampton, N.H.
   G.E. Capital Corp., based in Stamford, Conn., is buying the
container business on behalf of its Genstar Container Corp.
subsidiary, based in San Francisco.
   Itel's stock rose 87{ cents to $11.87{ a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

   Three American pioneers in financial
economics and corporate finance won the 1990 Nobel prize in
economics today.
   It was the seventh time in 10 years the award, given by the
Swedish Academy of Sciences, has gone to Americans.
   Harry Markowitz of the City University of New York was cited for
developing the theory of portfolio choice, the academy said.
   Merton Miller of the University of Chicago was honored for his
``fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate finance.''
   William Sharpe of Stanford University won for his contributions
to the theory of price formation for financial assets, the
so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model, the academy said.
   The three will divide the $700,000 prize.
   Since 1969, when the prize was first awarded, 18 of the 30
winners of the economics prize have been Americans.
   The announcement of the prize was delayed for more than 45
minutes, while the academy tried unsuccessfully to reach Markowitz,
who was in Japan.
   Miller and Sharpe, the laureates the academy reached by
telephone, were ``really stunned,'' said Professor Assar Lindbeck
of the Swedish Academy of Sciences.
   He said they asked about the exchange rate between the dollar
and the kronor.
   ``We wanted to give the prize for pioneer work, innovators,''
said Lindbeck. He said financial markets has been one of the
hottest areas for economic research in the past 10 years.
   Most of the prizewinners' work was done in the 1950s and 1960s.
Their theories began to be used in the early 1970s, he said.
   ``Each of them (the winners) gave one building block'' to the
financial market theory, Lindbeck said. ``The theory would have
been incomplete if one of them had been missing. Together they
created a complete picture of theory for the financial market which
has had great importance in research and education.''
   Most previous prizes have been awarded for broader areas of
research, Lindbeck said. The working of financial markets is a
specialized field.
   ``Financial markets serve a key purpose in a modern market
economy by allocating productive resources among various areas of
production,'' the academy said.
   To a large extent, it is through financial markets that savings
in different sectors of the economy are transferred to firms for
investments in buildings and machines, the academy said.
   It also said, ``Financial markets reflect firms' expected
prospects and risks, which implies that risks can be spread and
that savers and investors can acquire valuable information for
their investment decisions.''
   Markowitz, 63, a native of Chicago, made ``the first pioneering
contribution in the field of financial economics'' in the 1950s,
the academy said.
   He developed a theory for households' and companys' allocation
of financial assets under uncertainty, the so-called theory of
portfolio choice.
   The theory analyzes how wealth can best be invested in assets
that differ in their expected return and risk. It therefore helps
reduce risk.
   Miller, 67, a native of Boston, made the most important
achievements in the theory of corporate finance and the evaluation
of companys on markets, said the academy.
   Miller initially collaborated with 1985 economics prize-winner
Franco Modigliani of the United States.
   The theory explains the relation, or lack of relation, between
companys' capital asset structure and dividend policy on one hand,
and their market value on the other.
   ``I'm delighted to accept it, and I'm still in a state of
shock,'' Miller said in a radio interview this morning.
   ``Our work was always known as the Modigliani-Miller
propositions of corporate finance,'' he said. ``He then won it for
his contributions with me but also for his other work in economics.
   ``They've already recognized the work once and now I'm getting
the other half,'' he said.
   Sharpe, 56, a native of Cambridge, Mass., was the leading figure
among several researchers in the 1960s who used Markowitz's
portfolio theory as a basis for developing a theory of price
formation for financial assets, the academy said. That was the
so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model.
   The economics prize is the only Nobel award established to
complement the five prizes that dynamite-inventor Alfred Nobel
created in his will at the end of last century. It was instituted
in 1968 by Sweden's Central Bank.
   Nobel's original prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, peace
and literature have been awarded since 1901.
   The economics prize is awarded by the same body that awards
Nobel's physics and chemistry prizes. It follows the same
guidelines, including Nobel's wish that the prize shall be awarded
to those who have ``conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.''
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was awarded the peace
prize on Monday.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death in 1896. The peace prize is given in Oslo, and the others in
Stockholm.

   California led a decline for the week in the
number of working oil and natural gas rigs in the United States,
which dipped by eight this week to 1,056, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported.
   The Houston-based toolmaker reported Monday the count remained
above that for the same week a year ago, when there were 981
working rigs. Last week, Baker Hughes reported an increase of 17
rigs to 1,064, working wells.
   California reported a loss of six rigs for the week, followed by
Texas and North Dakota, which each lost three; Oklahoma and
Michigan, which each dropped two, and Colorado, which dropped one
rig.
   Baker-Hughes has kept track of the rig count, the widely watched
index of drilling activity, since 1940. The count represents the
number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Louisiana showed the most gains for the week, with an additional
five rigs operating there. Kansas and Wyoming each added three rigs
for the week; New Mexico increased by two rigs; while Pennsylvania
added one.
   The count for Ohio remained unchanged.

   Douglas Aircraft Co. will lay off
1,200 workers at its Long Beach and Torrance facilities this year
and hopes to reduce its work force by another 1,500 employees in
1991, a company executive said.
   Layoff notices will be distributed this week to supervisors,
salaried workers and some unionized hourly employees, said Joe
Pirkle, chief financial officer. The ranks of aircraft assembly
workers will not be reduced, he said Monday.
   The layoffs will take effect in December, Pirkle said.
   The aerospace firm plans to reduce its work force by another
1,500 employees next year through attrition, he said.
   Beset by slumping defense spending, Douglas already had laid off
5,000 workers and 2,200 contract employees since May.
   The layoffs are part of a $700 million cost-cutting program
ordered by Douglas' parent company, McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St.
Louis.
   Douglas employs about 46,500 workers at its headquarters and
final assembly facility in Long Beach and its Torrance fabrication
plant.

<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. has taken
a step toward selling its three hotels and one casino in the
Bahamas, but the company says no sale is imminent.
   The casino company announced Monday the hiring of Salomon
Brothers investment firm to help sell its Paradise Island
properties because of its experience selling hotel and resort
properties, said Resorts spokesman Andy Brimmer.
   That includes the sale last year of more than 500,000 rooms in
the U.S. hotel industry, Brimmer said.
   Resorts officials told the state Casino Control Commission in
August that they expect to sell the properties by December 1991,
two months before the casino company's license comes up for
renewal.
   Resorts anticipates the sale would generate between $250 million
and $300 million.
   Prior to their August approval of a debt-for-equity plan to take
Resorts out of bankruptcy, state casino commissioners said the
Paradise Island sale was crucial to the success of Resorts'
restructuring.
   Resorts also retained Salomon Brothers last year as bankruptcy
advisors.
   Brimmer said a sale was not imminent and that the December 1991
target remains viable, although the latest possible sale date would
be within four years.
   ``I do think that they plan to sell it in a fairly timely
manner,'' Brimmer said Monday. ``They're not going to make any rash
decisions.''
   He discounted the prospect of trying to sell a casino company
when gaming revenues are flat and indications are that the country
may be heading into a recession.
   ``It's being sold on a global basis. It's nt affected by local
economic problems,'' Brimmer said. ``This is the crown jewel.''
   Resorts' Atlantic City property - Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino
Hotel - recorded a profit of $2.7 million on gross revenue of $59.2
million for the quarter ending June 30, the latest period for which
figures were available.
   Overall, Resorts International posted net earnings of $803,000
on revenues of $109.1 million for the second quarter.
   Like the rest of the Atlantic City gaming industry, Resorts
Casino Hotel has lost business as a result of the recession and the
April opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
   Last month, Resorts posted gross gaming revenues of $17.9
million - a 12.9 percent decline from the $20.5 million recorded in
September 1989.
   Salomon Brothers director Charles Masson said he would not
comment on a price for the Bahamian properties but shared Brimmer's
optimism that a sale would occur.
   ``Clearly, it's in the company's best interest to sell the
property as soon as possible,'' Masson said. ``The environment for
selling these types of properties is obviously not the best.''

<HEAD>FBI, Education Department Join In Investigation of Sallie Mae
Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have begun an
investigation of the Student Loan Marketing Association office in
Lawrence, Kan., to determine if it bought worthless loans to
inflate assets and boost the company's stock price, an FBI
spokesman said.
   Max Geiman, spokesman in the FBI's Kansas City office, said
Monday that agents with the Education Department's Inspector
General's Office in Kansas City and the FBI started a joint
criminal investigation three weeks ago.
   He said it began after two former employees filed a lawsuit
alleging fraud within the loan servicing and purchasing procedures
of the association, commonly called Sallie Mae.
   ``The purpose is to determine if there has in fact been any
violation of any criminal laws,'' Geiman said.
   He said the investigation could be lengthy, given the complexity
of Sallie Mae, which holds $18 billion in student loans, making it
the nation's largest purchaser of government-backed student loans.
   The Lawrence operation is one of five Sallie Mae loan servicing
centers.
   Gisela Vallandigham, a spokesman at Sallie Mae's headquarters in
Washington, D.C., denied the allegations and declined to comment on
the investigation.
   Geiman said the investigation is the result of the lawsuit filed
in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Kan., by Diana Crossfield
and Brenda Albright, former managers at Sallie Mae's Lawrence
office.
   Ms. Crossfield was once the second-highest ranking manager at
the center. She and Ms. Albright allege they were forced to resign
last year after telling top management about irregularities in
Sallie Mae's methods.
   The two allege that Sallie Mae bought large numbers of void and
canceled student loans from banks, and employees were instructed to
log those loans into the ledger, even though the student borrowers
clearly owed nothing.
   They say that loans that had lost their federal guarantees were
purchased and put on the books, even though they stood to cost
Sallie Mae money if the borrower defaulted.
   Further, they contend Sallie Mae told students their accounts
were delinquent when they were current, in an attempt to collect
more money.
   Their complaint does not indicate how large the problem was, or
whether the alleged practices were common outside the Lawrence
servicing center.
   Ms. Crossfield and Ms. Albright said they discovered the
problems during internal auditing ordered by management.
   Worried that recognition of those problems would result in lost
revenue that would devalue Sallie Mae's stock, those supervisors
allegedly stopped the investigation and forced out the two women.
   Besides Sallie Mae, the lawsuit names nine individuals as
defendants, including Edward Fox and Lawrence A. Hough, the past
and present presidents of Sallie Mae, respectively.
   The lawsuit alleges securities fraud, as well as wire and mail
fraud in a civil complaint brought under the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act. The suit also alleges equal pay
violations in which female supervisors were paid less than their
male counterparts.
   Sallie Mae denies allegations contained in the suit, saying it
has investigated the claims and finds no merit. Bankers who
allegedly sold the bad paper also deny selling Sallie Mae void and
canceled loans.
   Ms. Crossfield and Ms. Albright filed suit for wrongful
dismissal on Sept. 14. Sallie Mae has not responded to the
complaint in court filings.
   Reports on the suit prompted federal investigators to approach
the women for further information. The two have declined to speak
publicly about the allegations in their lawsuit.
   Student loans are guaranteed and subsidized by the federal
government. Banks originate the loans, but then sell them to a
secondary lender such as Sallie Mae.
   Typically, a bank sends a two-party check to the student's
school before reselling the loan. With the student's signature on
the check, financial aid officers then cash them to pay tuition and
fee. If a student fails to enroll or doesn't qualify for the loan
for some reason, the loan is canceled.

   The United Steelworkers of America will ask
USX Corp. for a $1.25-per-hour raise, the union said as talks began
on a new contract for 18,000 workers.
   USX, the nation's largest steel maker, hasn't revealed what
terms it will seek in the negotiations which opened Monday. The old
contract expires Feb. 1.
   The union has said it wants USX to fall in line with other steel
makers who restored pay cuts that workers absorbed during the
industry's decline in the early 1980s.
   According to Andrew ``Lefty'' Palm, USW District 15 director and
chairman of the union negotiating committee, USW will ask USX to
raise pay $1.25 an hour. USX workers make an average of $10.82 to
$10.87 an hour, excluding benefits.
   Companies that have agreed to reinstate pay concessions are
Bethlehem Steel Corp., National Steel Corp., Armco Inc. and the
financially ailing Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and LTV Steel
Co.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry and Thomas J. Usher, president of
the company's steel division, have said the company will stand
alone in talks and ignore agreements struck with competing steel
makers.
   ``We're optimistic we can get an agreement in this early
bargaining process that will be in the interest of all concerned,
the company and its employees,'' said Thomas W. Sterling, USX's
chief negotiator.
   Palm has said the union will ask USX to pay into an
industry-wide job training fund if the company schedules excessive
overtime. The other steel makers have accepted the penalty, he
said.
   The talks began 3{ months before the four-year contract's Feb. 1
expiration. Normally negotiations start a month or two before
contracts expire.
   USX makes steel in Braddock, Irwin and Fairless Hills; South
Chicago, Ill.; Gary, Ind.; and Birmingham, Ala. It mines iron ore
in Minntac, Minn.
   The company operates several joint ventures, including a
partnership with Japan's Kobe Steel in Lorain, Ohio. Workers at
those plants are being included in the talks for the first time.

   University of Chicago economist Merton Miller said he initially
thought it was a crank call when he was told he had won the 1990
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science today.
   ``I'm delighted to accept it, and I'm still in a state of
shock,'' Miller said this morning.
   Miller was one of three U.S. economists to win the 1990 Nobel
prize in economics. He will share the $700,000 prize with Harry
Markowitz of the City University of New York and William Sharpe of
Stanford University.
   Markowitz, 63, a Chicago native cited for developing the theory
of portfolio choice, said he gave up any hopes of winning the Nobel
prize nine years ago when Yale University Professor James Tobin was
honored for work on another facet of portfolio theory.
   ``I'd thought it was never going to happen,'' Markowitz said
after news that he had won the 1990 prize reached him in Tokyo,
where he starts teaching a class at Tokyo University on Wednesday.
   ``There was a prize given to James Tobin, also in portfolio
theory but applied more to economics and less to business
administration than mine.
   ``I figured that's it. They've given the prize for portfolio
theory.''
   Markowitz's portfolio theory analyzes how wealth can be best
invested in assets that differ in their expected return and risk.
The theory involves use of computers and data bases and is used by
large institutional investors in the United States, Markowitz said.
   Miller of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
Business, was honored for his ``fundamental contributions to the
theory of corporate finance.''
   The Swedish Academy of Sciences said the 67-year-old Miller made
the most important achievements in the theory of corporate finance
and the evaluation of firms on markets.
   In a telephone interview, the Boston native said he got the news
in an early-morning phone call and ``thought it was a crank call at
first'' when he didn't hear anything on the line.
   But he said his ``heart kind of stopped a bit'' when he heard
the news from the accented voice on the other end of the phone.
   He worked initially in collaboration with 1985 economics
prize-winner Franco Modigliani of the United States.
   The corporate-finance theory explains the relation, or lack of
one, among firms' capital asset structure and dividend policy on
the one hand, and their market value on the other.
   ``Our work was always known as the Modigliani-Miller
propositions of corporate finance,'' Miller said. ``He then won it
for his contributions with me but also for his other work in
economics.
   ``They've already recognized the work once and now I'm getting
the other half.''
   Sharpe, 56, a native of Cambridge, Mass., won for his
contributions to the theory of price formation for financial
assets, the so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model, the academy
said.
   Since 1969, when the prize was first awarded, 18 of the 30
winners of the economics prize have been Americans.

<HEAD>Continental Delays Fare Increase, Announces Thanksgiving Companion
Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said it will postpone an 8
percent fare increase that was scheduled to begin today and
announced a Thanksgiving holiday deal for companion flights.
   Dave Messing, a spokesman for the Houston-based airline, said
Continental has delayed its fare increase until Oct. 23 in hopes
that competitors also will postpone increases.
   The higher fares will be Continental's third increase since the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that caused record increases in the
cost of jet fuel.
   Since the start of the Mideast crisis, the spot price for jet
fuel has jumped from about 57 cents a gallon to $1.42 a gallon,
according to Aviation Daily.
   While other carriers have considered such a move, only
sister-carrier Eastern has announced a similar increase.
   In addition, Continental said it is offering half-price
companion fares for travel on off-peak days around the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   Tickets must be reserved and purchased this week.
   Under the offer, travelers, purchasing a round-trip Max-$aver
fare for travel on U.S. mainland routes, leaving Nov. 14, 15, 18,
19, 20, 22 and 23 can take along a companion at half price.
   Return travel is permitted Nov. 22 and 23 or Nov. 27-Dec. 13.
   ``We can make this offer because business travel normally slacks
off for the entire Thanksgiving week, and holiday travel tends to
be concentrated on just a few days,'' a spokesman said. ``That
gives us the opportunity to make more discount seats available
during the off-peak days.''

   In the first public test of prosecutors'
evidence against Michael Milken, three government witnesses failed
to definitively link the junk-bond financier to a key stock
manipulation charge.
   At a special hearing on unproven allegations against Milken,
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader Peter Gardiner claimed
Monday his ex-boss ``without a doubt'' manipulated Wickes Cos.
stock in April 1986 - but he offered no direct evidence.
   Testifying with immunity, Gardiner also said he was told Milken
had authorized an order that Drexel workers throw out documents
after learning speculator Ivan Boesky was cooperating with the
government's securities fraud probe that November.
   But Gardiner and two other government witnesses failed to state
directly that Milken told Boesky - or ordered someone to tell
Boesky - to buy large blocks of Wickes in an illegal bid to drive
up the price as the government has charged.
   Milken, 44, was first linked to wrongdoing with Boesky almost
four years ago. He pleaded guilty in April to six counts of
conspiracy and fraud, but the special pre-sentencing hearing is the
first time the government's voluminous case involving dozens of
witnesses has been aired in a courtroom.
   The hearing is to give U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood more
information about Milken's professional character before
sentencing. The ex-head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., junk
bond division faces up to 28 years in prison.
   Wood said it was unclear from Gardiner's testimony that Milken
directly ordered a manipulation. She said Milken's statements, as
quoted by Gardiner, were ``fairly ambiguous.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said Milken was ``the only
person there who could authorize these transactions'' and that
despite the lack of a direct link to Boesky the April 23 activity
stemmed from his leadership position and his admitted illegal
relationship with Boesky.
   But the judge said: ``I can't just assume because he did
something in one context that he did it here.''
   Boesky's information led federal investigators to Milken, one of
the most successful financiers of the 1980s and the biggest figure
to fall in the prosecution of Wall Street corruption.
   The hearing in Manhattan federal court, scheduled to last two
weeks, continued today with further testimony on Wickes, the first
of three transactions to be discussed. Testimony was to resume
Thursday.
   Prosecutors questioning former Drexel corporate finance
executive Joseph Harch sought to show Drexel was motivated to help
Wickes retire the preferred stock to keep the client's business for
lucrative financings.
   But Harch said Wickes Chairman Sanford Sigoloff never asked
Drexel to buy Wickes stock to help retire the issue. Harch also
said he was never told by Milken to buy the stock.
   At issue is the purchase of 1.9 million shares of Wickes stock
by Boesky late on April 23, 1986, which helped the price close
above 6&lsqb; and meet a provision allowing the company to retire an
expensive issue of preferred stock.
   Gardiner testified Milken asked traders to obtain so-called
unsolicited orders from customers to buy Wickes - violating Drexel
policy for trading in securities of clients. Then he said Milken
told him, ``Peter, Wickes, 6&lsqb;, 6&lsqb;.''
   ``He looked at me and there was no question he was directing me
to find buyers of Wickes stock. . . . One thing I am sure of is
that Wickes was manipulated that day at Milken's direction without
a doubt,'' he said.
   Gardiner offered no evidence he had anything to do with getting
Boesky to buy Wickes stock for Drexel. He said his customers didn't
buy any Wickes. Another former Drexel trader, Cary Maultasch, last
week also failed to link Milken to Boesky on Wickes, as did
ex-Boesky trader Michael Davidoff.
   Gardiner contradicted testimony by Maultasch that Gardiner told
him to ask Boesky's trading company to buy Wickes. Gardiner said he
couldn't recall doing that.
   He said Milken asked him ``to call Cary and ask him to find out
how many Wickes we had bought.'' The government alleges Boesky made
the purchases secretly for Drexel.
   Gardiner also said he believed Milken had approved an order to
junk-bond department workers to discard documents on the day
Boesky's plea deal with the government was announced on Nov. 14,
1986.
   After Boesky's plea was announced, Gardiner said former junk
bond executive Alan Rosenthal told traders to ``clean out your
desks, get rid of anything that isn't nailed down ... and don't
throw it in the company garbage. ... He said that he had talked to
Mike.''
   On the alleged document destruction, Gardiner conceded Milken's
name often was used by other junk-bond workers even when Milken
himself had not approved an order.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong gain in space and aviation business
keyed a 12.2 percent earnings increase at Honeywell Inc. in the
third quarter, the controls maker said Tuesday.
   Counting a $3.3 million loss from the spinoff of a major portion
of its defense business, Honeywell posted third quarter profits of
$83.5 million, or $2.21 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30
compared with $74.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the same period
a year ago.
   Sales increased 4.1 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.5 billion a
year earlier.
   ``While we are concerned about the economic outlook, especially
in the United States, our order rates remained positive in the
third quarter,'' said James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Third-quarter operating profit for the company's space and
aviation sector was $55.2 million, more than double the $26.9
million in 1989. The commercial flight systems, military avionics
and space systems businesses all reported strong results, Renier
said. Sales for the sector were $501.7 million, compared with
$500.7 million in third-quarter 1989.
   Honeywell's industrial sector also gained in the third quarter
with operating profits of $47.4 million, a 21.2 percent increase
over the same period in 1989 when operating profits in the division
were $39.1 million.
   Operating profits in the homes and buildings sector were $61.8
million, down from $62.6 million.
   Renier said the loss from the spinoff of Alliant Techsystems
equaled 9 cents a share. A year ago in the third quarter the
discontinued defense business earned $6.6 million for Honeywell, or
15 cents a share.
   Nine-month net income was $272.6 million, or $7.08 a share, up
28.5 percent from $212.1 million, or $4.92 a share, in 1989.
   Total sales for the first nine months of 1990 were $4.636
billion, up 4.2 percent from $4.449 billion in 1989.

   The Brazilian airline Varig has placed orders for
as many as 26 Boeing jetliners in a deal valued at up to $2.6
billion, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said Tuesday.
   The order comes just one day after United Airlines placed what
could amount to the largest commercial aircraft order in history:
$22 billion for as many as 128 planes.
   The Varig deal includes firm orders for six 747-400s and eight
737-300s, totaling $1.3 billion, Boeing said in a release. It
includes options for five 747-400s and seven 737-300s.
   The order is the largest in dollar terms of any Latin American
carrier.
   In February Varig confirmed orders for 15 Boeing 737-300s valued
at $450 million.
   The 747-400 is the world's largest commercial aircraft, seating
up to 412 passengers. It can fly nonstop up to 8,400 miles.
   The 737-300 seats up to 128 passengers and can fly close to
3,000 miles nonstop.
   The announcement brings total orders of the 747-400 to 385, and
for all 737 models to 2,842. Boeing orders for 1990, including
United's order Monday, total 413 planes valued at about $38.7
billion.

million or $1.01 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from
$278.2 million or 89 cents a share in the same period last year.
   Sales declined 2 percent, to $1.74 billion from $1.77 billion in
the 1989 period. However, the 1989 figure includes sales from the
company's household products business, Boyle-Midway Household
Products, which was sold in June. Excluding that business, which
makes such products as Woolite detergent and Black Flag bug spray,
sales increased 5 percent, the company said.
   It said sales of its health care products increased 6 percent.
Specifically, the company reported a 10 percent rise in
pharmaceuticals - its largest segment - and medical supplies and
diagnostic products. Consumer health care sales fell 4 percent.
   Sales in the food products division, which makes Chefboyardee,
rose 1 percent.
   For the first nine months of 1990, net income rose 13 pecent to
$902 million or $2.87 per share, from $797.8 million or $2.56 per
share in the 1989 period.
   Sales in the nine-month period increased 1 percent to $5.16
billion from $5.11 billion. Excluding sales from Boyle-Midway,
sales rose 3 percent.

<HEAD>Three Sundstrand Executives Found Innocent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday acquitted three former
mid-level Sundstrand Corp. executives of wrongdoing in a scheme by
the aerospace contractor to defraud the Pentagon.
   The verdicts ended the only prosecution of individuals so far in
connection with Sundstrand's admitted fraud, for which the Rockford
company paid the government nearly $200 million in a record
settlement for such offenses.
   U.S. District Judge Prentice H. Marshall said he was satisfied
the three defendants had done no wrong. But he said he was
``perplexed'' by the lack of other indictments, given Sundstrand's
1988 admission of corporate guilt.
   ``Why those who directed that behavior ... were not prosecuted
baffles me,'' Marshall said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Syfert declined to comment
immediately after the bench trial ended.
   The defendants were Ray John Chapel Jr., former director of
business planning; Ralph G. Hamann, former Sundstrand section
manager for government contracts; and Joseph J. McCarthy, former
vice president for finance and administration.
   Marshall found the men innocent of conspiracy to lie to the
government and of concealing the alleged conspiracy. He acquitted
them last week on charges of lying to the government. The trial
began Sept. 10.
   McCarthy said there was no fraud at Sundstrand.
   ``In my opinion, Sundstrand paid $200 million for nothing,'' he
said.
   He said that Sundstrand was ``extorted'' by a government threat
of racketeering charges and that the company's leaders ``made a
decision that dumped it all on me.''
   Hamann said the verdict ``makes me wonder what in hell we were
doing here. It just boggles my mind.''
   In 1988, Sundstrand pleaded guilty to five counts of criminal
fraud, admitting it had overbilled the Pentagon from May 1980
through August 1985.
   Sundstrand - which sells the Navy and Air Force generators and
parts - admitted billing the government for such expenses as
baby-sitting, golf, movies and snow plowing for executives.
   Sundstrand paid the government $199 million in fines and
penalties - the largest such payment ever - and was suspended for
nearly four months as a defense contractor.

   Sales of new action figure dolls combined
with a strong performance in Europe boosted Hasbro Inc.'s
third-quarter earnings nearly 6 percent, the company announced
Tuesday.
   The toymaker said it earned $33.1 million, or 57 cents per
share, for the July-September quarter, compared with $31.3 million,
or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue increased 11 percent to $448.8 million from $403
million.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, said
several new Hasbro toys enjoyed strong sales, including dolls based
on the pop musical group New Kids on the Block and World Wrestling
Federation characters.
   Hassenfeld said he was pleased with the results, but said much
of Hasbro's growth came from overseas.
   Slumping domestic sales forced the company to lay off about 90
of its white-collar workers in Rhode Island last week.
   John T. O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial officer, said strong
sales in new product lines was ``replacing volume that's going away
on other products.''
   ``Domestically, New Kids, World Wrestling Federation, Cabbage
Patch (dolls) all performed well,'' he said. ``But we needed those
to perform well to basically have a flat domestic business from
what we did a year ago.''
   The third-quarter results were not enough to offset the
company's earnings slump from earlier in the year. For the first
nine months of 1990, Hasbro reported profits of $61.3 million, or
$1.05 per share, down from $68.2 million, or $1.15 per share, a
year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $1.03 billion from $992.7 million.

<TEXT>
   Jean-Pierre Van Rossem was considered a
guru of Belgium's stock market, a self-proclaimed financial whiz
who reportedly managed $7 billion from international investors last
year alone.
   He also loved to flaunt his own wealth, which he once put at
$300 million: There was the fleet of red Ferraris he hauled to news
conferences, the prestigious Formula One racing team he sponsored.
   But Van Rossem's empire became unglued over the summer, the
apparent victim of a deal gone bad and overextension.
   Van Rossem, 45, recently spent a month and a half in jail -
including his honeymoon - on charges of forgery and writing bad
checks. The French photo company Kis accused him of not having
enough money to cover a check for $54 million for a 12 percent
stake in the company.
   ``I finally fell on my face,'' he said at a news conference over
the summer, called to announce that his company Moneytron was
broke.
   Moneytron has yet to file for bankruptcy. And earlier this
month, Van Rossem said was negotiating to sell the company to an
unnamed banking consortium in Singapore.
   In his heyday, Van Rossem boasted he knew a system to beat the
stock exchange and futures market and his Moneytron forecasting
system caught on among investors. Last year, he managed $7 billion
from international investors, according to the Financial Times of
London.
   It's not clear exactly how Van Rossem ran into his financial
problems. He blames much of his woes on go-betweens of an unnamed
U.S. broker, who, he says, failed to repay $362 million from a
futures deal. He said about $200 million of that money belonged to
clients.
   Today, Van Rossem says he lives off the profits from the
clothing shop owned by his new wife, Rachidi. In fact, she had to
put up the shop as collateral to pay the wedding bill, he said.
   Despite his personal misforutnes, Van Rossem remains ``an expert
in the media game,'' said Hans Verstraeten, a communications
professor at the Brussels University.
   His hulking figure, unaffected by 45 days of prison food,
recently adorned the pages of Britain's Financial Times. His
rasping, insolent voice is still in demand with talk show hosts. A
recent magazine interview with him was advertised in advance in
major newspapers.
   ``In a small country like this, not a lot has to happen before
you stand out,'' said Verstraeten.
   ``He is the rebel who worked his way up and still mocks the
rich,'' added Guy Mortier, editor of the magazine Humo, which
featured Van Rossem on its cover recently. ``Maybe people will tire
of him but I think he still has a long way to go.''
   Van Rossem doesn't exactly cut the figure of a smooth operator.
   He is grossly overweight. His gray, straggly hair droops onto
his chest. He smokes non-stop and in heated discussions - his usual
style of conversing - white spittle forms in the corners of his
mouth.
   As a guest on a popular television talk show recently, Van
Rossem assailed an earlier guest - the mayor of a North Sea resort
who wants to keep working class visitors out of his tony town - for
making ``racist'' and ``criminal'' remarks about the working man.
   In 1989, when he owned the Onyx Formula One racing team, Van
Rossem called one racing organizer a ``Nazi'' and another a
``shark.''
   Born into a Catholic family whose bourgeois lifestyle he said he
despised, Van Rossem became a Marxist as a student.
   With his capitalist ventures in shambles, he now calls himself
an anarchist.
   Van Rossem said literature is his next domain. He wants to
``fill the void'' in modern literature in Belgium and the
Netherlands with a thriller penned in prison.
   His novel, ``The State in a State of Decomposition,'' was
released earlier this month.
   He also wrote a crude poem recently about his father describing
him as having ``a mouth full of vinegar and slime.'' He and his
father are no longer on good terms.
   On his tombstone he said he would like to have inscribed: ``Here
lies Van Rossem. He made loads of money for others, but didn't keep
a cent for himself.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall As Harvest Advances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as harvest pressure
prevailed over the mixed effects of a congressional compromise on a
new crop program.
   House and Senate negotiators approved the ``Triple Base''
program, which will result in more soybean acreage and fewer corn
and wheat acreage planted next year than would otherwise be the
case.
   The news initially prompted heavy selling of soybeans for
delivery in the fall of 1991 and buying of new-crop corn and wheat.
   But prices closed lower across the board in reaction to
forecasts for continued good harvesting weather in the Midwest and
a government report that showed 40 percent of the soybean harvest
and 32 percent of the corn harvest complete as of Sunday.
   ``The harvest is going along nicely and that weighed down the
market in general,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3 cents to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.60{ a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.26{ a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.18} a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents to 9{ cents lower with November at $6.10{ a

<NOTE>Eds: DELETES 10th graf to CORRECT that DeBartolo not running
Campeau.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., one of Campeau Corp.'s
largest creditors, said Tuesday it will not extend an agreement
that prevented it from seizing assets of the beleaguered Campeau
without notice.
   Under the agreement, DeBartolo could not call in $480 million in
loans to Campeau without giving nine days notice. DeBartolo had
extended the agreement several times over the past year, but
allowed it to expire Tuesday.
   Campeau spokesman Richard Wertheim said DeBartolo's decision
meant a similar agreement with two Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
subsidiaries involving a $260 million loan from those firms was
also suspended.
   Wertheim said it was too soon to tell if Youngstown, Ohio-based
DeBartolo would move on any Campeau assets, mainly Campeau's
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   However, even if they did try to seize Campeau assets, most are
tied up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings now under way in
the United States, Wertheim said.
   Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. is also going through the Chapter
11 process.
   ``We're continuing to talk,'' said Wertheim. ``He (Edward J.
DeBartolo) has talked about various options. I hope we'll continue
talking and see where it goes from there.''
   Campeau borrowed $480 million from DeBartolo to help finance the
$6.7 billion buyout of Federated in 1988. The buyout failed a year
ago after Campeau was unable to make interest payments on junk
bonds used to finance the Federated and Allied deals.
   After Federated filed for protection from its creditors,
liability for the loan fell to Campeau, which had struck the loan
agreement with DeBartolo.
   Wertheim has said Campeau Corp.'s strategy is to reorganize the
U.S. operations under the Chapter 11 process, sell off a
substantial portion of the company's real estate holdings in Canada
and reach an agreement on restructuring the debt with the principal
lenders, including DeBartolo and Olympia &amp; York.

<HEAD>No Progress on GATT-Farm Subsidy Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community nations remained divided
Tuesday over a subsidy reduction plan designed to end a deadlock
with the United States in talks to liberalize world trade.
   Officials said the EC agriculture ministers could not back a
compromise under which the EC Commission would devise compensation
measures aimed at offering ``a future to the Community's farmers.''
   Sources said the compromise was rejected as too vague. France
and West Germany were the strongest opponents to both the
compromise and a 30 percent cut in subsidies, while Britain, the
member most favoring free trade, supported the subsidy cuts.
   The issue is key to the success of the Uruguay round of talks to
liberalize world trade, held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks are scheduled to end in
December.
   The United States wants an elimination or drastic reduction in
subsidies, saying they give an unfair advantage to farmers in EC
member nations. But most EC states find as much as a 30 percent cut
too drastic, arguing the subsidies are needed to help their farmers
compete.
   The 30 percent cut would apply to such products as cereals,
rice, sugar and livestock over the period 1986-1996, but not to
subsidies for exports of EC farm goods.
   On Monday, the EC missed a GATT deadline to submit a formal
proposal on subsidies while the United States issued a proposal
calling for 90 percent cuts in export subsidies and 75 percent cuts
in subsidies to farmers over 10 years, starting in 1991.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington
Monday the United States ``simply concluded that in the next 10
years we may well not be able to get all the way.''
   ``But let's go as far as we can,'' he added.
   Agricultural subsidies cost the industrialized world an
estimated $250 billion a year, with just over half of that spent by
the EC.

<HEAD>Four Big Drug Companies Report Higher Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies reported sharply
higher third-quarter results Tuesday, led in part by strong sales
growth at home and abroad for disease-fighting drugs.
   The results reported by Warner Lambert Co., Merck &amp; Co., Eli
Lilly and Co. and Pfizer Inc. also reflected the declining strength
of the dollar, which inflates the value of sales in other countries
when calculated in dollars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Warner-Lambert</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said earnings for
the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $124.76 million or 93 cents
a share, up 16.7 percent from $106.92 million or 79 cents a share a
year in the 1989 third quarter. The year-earlier per-share figures
were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split this past May.
   Third-quarter sales rose to $1.19 billion, a quarterly record,
up 7 percent from $1.11 billion a year earlier.
   Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the results to the strength of the company's worldwide
pharmaceutical business, led by prescription drug sales, notably in
the cholesterol-regulating drug Lopid.
   Non-prescription drug sales also rose, paced by strong
performance of Listerine mouthwash and Halls cough tablets. The
gums and mints segment, which includes brands such as Certs,
Chiclets and Sugar Daddy, fell slightly.
   For the nine months, Warner-Lambert said earnings totaled
$379.54 million or $2.83 a share, up 18.5 percent from $320.36
million or $2.37 a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $3.44
billion vs. $3.15 billion, up 9.2 percent.

<HEAD>Merck</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Merck, a Rahway, N.J.-based maker of health products and
specialty chemicals, said third-quarter earnings rose 19 percent to
$465 million or $1.19 a share, from $390.5 million or 99 cents a
share a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $1.91 billion from
$1.63 billion a year earlier.
   The company reported gains in all operations and said there was
particularly strong demand for its pediatric vaccine M-M-R II,
which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. The Centers for
Disease Control strengthened its recommended dosage of the vaccine
in response to higher incidence of measles infections in the United
States.
   For the nine months, Merck said earnings totaled $1.34 billion
or $3.42 a share, up 18.5 percent from $1.13 billion or $2.85 a
share a year earlier. Sales totaled $5.57 billion vs. $4.79
billion, up 16.3 percent.

<HEAD>Eli Lilly</HEAD>

   Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, said third-quarter
earnings rose 21 percent to a record $257 million or 90 cents a
share, vs. $212.4 million or 73 cents a share a year earlier.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood attributed the strength to higher sales
at home and abroad, led by demand for the antidepressant drug
Prozac and other pharmaceuticals.
   For the nine months, Lilly earned $872 million or $2.99 a share,
up 22 percent from $714.2 milloin or $2.45 a share a year earlier.
Nine-month sales totaled $3.75 billion vs. $3.03 billion, up 23.7
percent.

<HEAD>Pfizer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer, a New York-based maker of health care and consumer
products and specialty drugs, said third-quarter earnings totaled
$243.3 million or $1.45 a share, up 12 percent from $217.5 million
or $1.29 a share a year earlier. Quarterly sales totaled $1.64
billion vs. $1.44 billion, up 14 percent.
   The company said strong growth in pharmaceutical sales was paced
by the cardiovascular agent Procardia XL and antifungal drug
Diflucan.
   For the nine months, Pfizer said earnings totaled $646.4 million
or $3.85 a share, up 8.8 percent from $594 million or $3.52 a share
a year earlier. Sales for the period totaled $4.62 billion, up 10.5
percent from $4.18 billion.

<HEAD>Citicorp's Profits Drop 38 Percent in Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp on Tuesday reported a 38 percent plunge
in third-quarter profits as problem loans mounted, putting
increasing pressure on the nation's largest banking company to
restructure and rebuild its capital base.
   Separately, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and First Interstate
Bancorp reported a return to profitability while No. 12-ranked
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said profits rose 6 percent.
   Citicorp's net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled
$221 million, or 56 cents a share, down from $358 million, or 99
cents a share a year earlier.
   Analysts had expected earnings in the 70 cent-a-share range. But
Rick Mueller, a vice president with Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps,
noted that despite the worse-than-expected earnings, analysts are
``worried about other issues.''
   What sparked concern was a 34 percent increase in problem loans
- excluding debt to less-developed countries - which grew to $5.65
billion from $4.54 billion in the previous quarter.
   ``That's up significantly,'' Mueller said. Though analysts had
expected an increase in Citicorp's non-performing assets, Mueller
said the size of the increase makes it ``that much more difficult
what they will have to do to take care of it.''
   With capital levels below industry norms, Citicorp has been
pressed to restructure. In recent months commercial businesses in
the bank's global finance unit have been under review.
   But analysts anticipate a larger, companywide restructuring to
take place involving significant cutbacks in personnel, asset
sales, a possible stock issuance and trimming of the dividend.
   Surprisingly, the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of
44 cents a share. The announcement comes at a time when other major
banks have been forced to scale cut payouts to shareholders to
rebuild capital.
   Citicorp stock fell 25 cents to a $13.87{ share in late trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively
traded issue. Experts have said relatively high dividends have
served to support bank stocks as earnings eroded.
   Separately, interest revenue during the period totaled $7.3
billion, down 11 percent from $8.19 billion a year earlier.
Interest expense amounted to $5.48 billion, down 13 percent from
$6.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.
   Citicorp noted in a statement that it ``continued to be
pro-active in recognizing loan losses and has been building its
corporate reserve position to provide for possible further
deterioration.''
   The bank said that because the domestic real estate market has
not yet stabilized, ``continued write-offs and `cost to carry' will
extended into 1991.'' Citicorp said non-performing domestic
commercial real estate loans totaled $2.18 billion, up from $1.17
billion in the third quarter of 1989.
   Loans to less-developed countries totaled $3.55 billion during
the quarter, down from $3.58 billion in the previous quarter and
$4.93 billion a year ago.
   For the nine-month period, Citicorp said profits totaled $700
million, or $1.81 a share, down 45 percent from $1.28 billion, or
$3.62 a share in the first nine months of 1989.
   Interest revenue rose 4 percent to $23.68 billion from $22.68
billion while interest expense advanced 7 percent to $18.26 billion
from $17.14 billion in the first nine months of last year.

year-ago quarter.
   The recent quarter's results included a $90.1 million pre-tax

<HEAD>Hanson Swaps Newmont Mining Stake for Timber Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British conglomerate Hanson PLC said Tuesday
it had agreed to swap its 49 percent stake in Newmont Mining Corp.
for control of a major U.S. timber company.
   Hanson said it agreed to buy General Oriental Securities Ltd.
and Hornwood Barbados Ltd. of the United States for $1.3 billion in
cash.
   Together, the two companies own 99.5 percent of Cavenham Forest
Industries, the large U.S. timber company.
   Hanson said that at the same time it would sell its 49 percent
stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the United States to the owners of
General Oriental and Hornwood for $1.1 billion in cash and $189
million in notes.
   The remaining 51 percent stake in Newmont is held by the public.
   Hanson acquired its stake in Newmont as part of its August 1989
purchase of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC for 3.3 billion pounds, or
$6.5 billion.
   General Oriental Securities and Hornwood are controlled by
companies associated with financier Sir James Goldsmith and British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild, sources close to the companies
said, speaking anonymously.
   Hanson Chairman Gordon White said Cavenham's strong cash flow
and profit record would enhance Hanson's natural resources
interests.
   Cavenham owns or controls about 1.7 million acres of timberland
in the U.S. West and South.
   In July, Hanson paid $1.2 billion for full control of Peabody
Holding Co., the United States' biggest coal producer.
   Hanson has extensive interests in the United States, including
SCM Chemicals, Grove Cranes, Jacuzzi whirlpool spas, Kaiser cement,
and Ames Garden tools.

<HEAD>Lufthansa Withdraws Application to Acquire Share in Interflug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lufthansa said Tuesday it has
withdrawn its application to acquire a 26 percent stake in the
former East German state airline, Interflug.
   Lufthansa, which is 51 percent-owned by the German government,
said in a short statement that a ``changed situation exists'' since
German unification on Oct. 3.
   It said because the Bonn government now owns the assets and
shareholdings of the former East German state, the fact that both
Lufthansa and Interflug are controlled by one major shareholder
``opens creative maneuvering room that must be considered.''
   The statement provided no further elaboration. A spokesman at
the company's headquarters said only that the changed political
situation in Germany ``leaves all the options open'' regarding
Interflug's future.
   He declined to comment on whether Lufthansa currently is
negotiating with government officials in Bonn over business links
with Interflug.
   Lufthansa and the Federal Cartel Office have been at odds over
the airline's intention to expand broadly into eastern Germany.
   The office, in a preliminary opinion, recently informed
Lufthansa of its reservations about the planned cooperation with
Interflug on antitrust grounds. Lufthansa dominates its domestic
market.
   Berlin-based Interflug serves what is now eastern Germany and is
in dire need of a complete overhaul of its fleet, which consists
mainly of aging Soviet airliners. Interflug recently was reported
by the Hamburg-based weekly news magazine Der Spiegel to be on the
verge of bankruptcy.
   The German government is said to be eager to sell off at least
part of Interflug into private hands quickly.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists say they were heartened by
the approval early Tuesday by a House-Senate conference committee
of a $40.8 billion farm bill that enhances agricultural
conservation.
   ``It's now an environmental statute,'' Ken Cook of the Center
for Resource Economics said of the farm bill. ``We've made it one
where it wasn't before.''
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee and the conference committee, said the package was ``a
mark of how environmental awareness is changing in this country.''
   The committee, which has been working on the legislation for
weeks, completed the bill after a 14-hour marathon of negotiations
that ended Tuesday at 3:45 a.m. EDT.
   The major disappointment for environmental groups watching the
lengthy negotiations was the omission of a ban on the export of
pesticides that are outlawed or unregistered in the United States.
   ``They showed who they work for,'' Bill McNichol of the National
Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides said of the conferees.
``They had to make a choice between the economic interests of the
chemical companies and the safety of consumers.''
   ``It was an important provision that will be enacted someday
soon,'' said Kathryn Hohmann of the Sierra Club. ``But we look at
the other provisions in the bill and we see some gigantic
strides.''
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday he does not
like everything in the bill and would have written it differently.
   ``But, in the end, it is a respectable work product that
balances well innumerable sensitive, often divergent interests,''
he said in a statement.
   Agriculture Undersecretary Richard Crowder predicted President
Bush would be satisfied with the bill.
   Leahy had made the pesticide export ban a personal crusade, but
pulled it from the negotiating table when conference members tried
to water down stringent language he had designed.
   The proposal had been intended to stop pesticides that are not
used in the United States because of health concerns from showing
up on the American dinner table as residue on imported food.
   But chemical companies lobbied hard against the plan, saying
they would lose billions of dollars in overseas business and be
forced to close manufacturing plants in the United States, wiping
out hundreds of jobs.
   The National Agricultural Chemical Association pointed out that
many pesticides manufactured here are unregistered because they are
directed at pests that exist only in other countries.
   Leahy said he would introduce his plan as separate legislation
next session.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee, called the overall farm bill an ``excellent
marriage'' of environmental and business concerns.
   ``It gives the American farmer a great deal of flexibility and
freedom to plant,'' he said. ``It clearly is oriented to make us
more competitive.''
   Some of the planting flexibility in the bill was forced on the
committee by the need to cut the federal budget by $500 billion
over the next five years, including $13.6 billion from agriculture.
   ``You cross your fingers and hope that giving them flexibility
will make up for the loss of support,'' said de la Garza.
   The bulk of the bill's budget savings would be achieved by
requiring farmers of rice, feed grains, wheat and cotton to reduce
the acreage protected by the government's support system by 15
percent in each of the five years of the measure.
   This so-called ``triple-base'' plan allows farmers flexibility
to plant those commodities, experimental crops, industrial crops,
or products not already in substantial supply. However, they would
not be subsidized by the taxpayers.
   The government sends the farmer a check, known as a deficiency
payment, when the market price falls below the
government-established target price.
   The conferees agreed to calculate those payments on a 12-month
basis, starting in 1994, instead of the current five months used
for most crops. Since current calculations are based on the months
immediately after harvest, when market prices are lowest, the
government expects to save money by averaging the entire year.
   The conference committee also agreed to allow winter wheat
farmers, who already are planting their crop, to choose between the
triple base or the 12-month deficiency payment for 1991.
   Despite the decreases in subsidies these changes would create,
the bill still provides $8 billion to $10 billion in support to
farmers, said Leahy.
   Other savings would come from:
   -Setting marketing loans for soybeans at $5.02 a bushel with a 2
percent service charge.
   -Putting a 1 percent service charge on loans for sugar, peanuts,
tobacco and honey.
   -Requiring reduction of 15 percent of acreage for the 1991 wheat
crop and 7.5 percent of the corn crop.
   Other significant provisions include:
   -A $10.10 per hundredweight minimum support price on dairy
products with a 5-cent assessment per hundredweight this year,
rising to 11-cents in later years.
   -A limit of $100,000 on deficiency payments and $150,000 on
marketing loans that can be received by a single farmer.
   -Continuation of the crop insurance program.
   -Forestry provisions designed to save millions of trees on
private forest land.
   -Incentives to farmers who participate in programs to improve
water quality around their farms and underground.
   -Strengthening of penalties against draining wetlands for crop
production.
   -Procedures by which farmers could drain wetlands in the middle
of their planting area if they create new wetlands on easements on
their property.
   -Requirements that records be kept on pesticides that are being
used.

<HEAD>Alaska Surges Ahead of Texas in Daily Oil Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska has surged ahead of Texas as the
nation's leading oil producer, topping the 2 million
barrels-per-day mark for the first time since Prudhoe Bay began its
decline in 1988, state officials said Monday.
   Texas, with a daily output of 1.7 million barrels of crude, is
now the nation's Number 2 producer.
   ``The numbers got our attention,'' said Chuck Logsdon, chief
petroleum economist with the Department of Revenue.
   Last summer, Alaska's crude oil production dropped to a low of
1.6 million barrels a day.
   Every 100,000-barrel-a-day increase in crude output, on an
annualized basis, produces another $200 million in revenue for the
state at current prices, he said.
   Nearly every oil field in the state has increased production
during the past month, said Dudley Platt, petroleum economist with
the Department of Revenue.
   ``Higher oil prices make people do crazy things,'' Platt said.
``A week ago a half million dollars was too much to spend on a
well, this week they'll spend a million to get it done in a
hurry,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Move Broadly Lower Amid Earnings Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices declined broadly on Wall Street today as
disappointing earnings reports and rising oil prices brought the
stock market's two-day rally to an end.
   Stocks meandered for the first half of the session, but took a
downward turn as third-quarter results began to flow in and oil
prices advanced.
   Among the casualties were companies that announced their results
today, but even firms that have yet to release their figures were
hit. Just the fear of lower earnings was enough to make some
traders sell, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, the November contract for delivery of light, sweet
crude oil rose 94 cents to $38.89 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, worsening the outlook for inflation.
   Analysts said many traders were on the sidelines, waiting for
September consumer price figures and the August trade deficit
report due out Thursday morning.
   Today's decline - which was steepened in the last half-hour by
computer-program trading - ended Wall Street's two-day rally. The
Dow Jones industrial average had gained more than 51 points over
Friday and Monday.
